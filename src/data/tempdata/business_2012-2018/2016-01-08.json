      "bodyText": "Happy new year, investors. US stocks have suffered their worst first week of the year since records began. The Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 6% and 6.2%, respectively, in the biggest ever fall for the first five days of January and the worst for any week since September 2011. US markets, which have been suffering big falls since Wednesday, continued to decline on Friday despite the release of data showing better than expected US jobs growth in December. The losses amounted to \u201cmore than the estimated US student loan debt and 12% of the US debt\u201d, noted Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones indices. The US stock declines follow drops in markets across most of the world sparked by renewed concerns about the health of the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second-largest. This week\u2019s declines wiped more than $2.3tn off the value of global stock markets, according to the S&amp;P Global Broad Market index (BMI). Every major European stock market also fell on Friday, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index also suffering its worst week since 2011. The FTSE 100 in London lost 0.7%. That took the FTSE 100\u2019s losses this week to 5.3%, wiping almost \u00a385bn off the value of the biggest 100 companies. There were also sharp moves on commodity markets. The prospect of weaker global growth coupled with a supply glut pushed the price of crude oil to its lowest level for almost 12 years. The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, had risen more than 2% on Friday after China sought to boost the yuan, and its stock exchanges abandoned a new \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism that had been blamed for much of the stock market havoc. However, in an echo of the see-saw pattern in stock markets those gains were later erased and Brent was trading at about $33 a barrel, near a low hit in 2004. With worries about a global downturn intensifying, investors offloaded riskier shares and flocked to so-called safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds. \u201cSo much for the new year bringing some relief to the markets\u201d said credit strategists at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cWorries about China, the endless drop in oil prices and even new geopolitical tensions pounded the markets, punishing risk assets with a flight to quality that was in full swing,\u201d they wrote, in a research note entitled: What\u2019s the Chinese for \u201couch\u201d? Chinese stock markets were suspended twice in a week after 7% falls tripped a new circuit breaker mechanism. It had been intended to stem sharp sell-offs but in the end appeared to have the opposite effect. In a dramatic U-turn, the mechanism was withdrawn just days after it had been introduced. Chinese stocks recovered by 2% on Friday after the yuan edged higher following days of depreciation that spooked investors and fuelled capital flight out of the country. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cChina\u2019s removal of counter-productive circuit breakers, state buying and a rise in the yuan helped prevent another stock market rout and alleviated concerns that the central bank would continue the rapid devaluation of the currency.\u201d After a day of wild trading, the Shanghai composite index and the CSI 300, which comprises the biggest stocks from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, finished about 2% higher, at 3,186.78 and 3,361.56 respectively. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng added 0.6%. The latest bout of stock market turmoil presents a major challenge to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who has portayed himself as the country\u2019s top economic steward, ahead of prime minister Li Keqiang. Xi was reportedly livid over a humiliating stock market debacle in mid-2015, lambasting senior economic officials after he appeared on the front cover of the Economist fighting to prop up Chinese shares.",

Warmer than average weather, fierce price competition, and the growth of online shopping has left a trail of profit warnings and resignations. But amid the gloom there is a bright spark \u2013 and it is coming from televisions, game consoles, and music players. Figures show the entertainment industry had a record year in 2015. Sales of music, film, TV series, and gaming products grew by 5.6% year on year to \u00a36.1bn, beating the previous record set in 2004. The surge in sales was driven by a handful of high-profile releases, led by Adele. The singer\u2019s new album, 25, sold an extraordinary 2.6m copies in the UK in just six weeks, making it the first multimillion album release in a calendar year since her previous album, 21, in 2011. Other popular entertainment products included Paddington, Jurassic World, and the Fifa 16 video game. This represents a remarkable recovery for a sector that endured a decade in the doldrums. Since 2004, the previous record year, piracy and digital services have threatened to wipe out physical sales, leaving publishers, record labels, film studios and retailers on edge. In the UK, well-known brands including Zavvi and HMV have collapsed into administration. \u201cThese figures give hope than we can finally put the past decade of decline behind us,\u201d Kim Bayley, chief executive of the Entertainment Retailers Association, said. \u201cThe music business really has been through the wringer in terms of falling sales and piracy. I believe the retailers and digital services who have invested hundreds of millions in developing new sales channels for music deserve a lot of credit. Without them, music would be in a very different place.\u201d Much of the recovery has been driven by investment in paid-for streaming and digital services by Apple, Netflix, Spotify and others. In 2015, digital sales rose 19.2% across all categories, with music sold through streaming services up nearly 50%. However, the industry would not have enjoyed a record year if these sales were simply replacing CDs and DVDs. Instead, physical products are proving resilient, particularly in music. There are clear signs that the decline of physical entertainment products may have bottomed out. Sales of physical music fell by just 0.5% in 2015, and it remains the biggest part of the market. This included a 3.7% fall in sales of CDs - the smallest decline for a decade - and a 65% rise in vinyl sales to the highest level in 21 years. According to the British Phonographic Industry, Adele led the revival of LP sales, but other big sellers included Amy Winehouse\u2019s Back to Black, which was boosted by the release of the documentary Amy, and the Stone Roses\u2019s self-titled 1989 album. Instead of new streaming services hurting physical music sales, they are eating into the digital download market. Music download sales fell 13% last year. \u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable the way the decline in CD sales seems to be flattening out. I\u2019m not sure anyone expected that in 2015 CDs would be doing relatively better than downloads,\u201d Bayley said. \u201cCD is now declining at its slowest rate for a decade. The benefits of the CD in terms of sound quality, the fact that it makes a great gift and it works well as an impulse buy are clearly working in its favour. The high street music market is undoubtedly smaller than it was, but it is clearly going to be around for some years to come.\u201d The fightback by physical entertainment products is demonstrated by the health of two retailers \u2013 HMV and Waterstones \u2013 which were both owned by HMV Group until they split in 2011. HMV collapsed into administration in 2013 with 223 shops and more than 4,000 employees. However, the remnants of the chain were bought by investment firm Hilco Capital, and since then it has been revived. HMV has about 130 shops in the UK, but Hilco has plans to open more and expand overseas, particularly in the Middle East and Asia. Last year HMV regained its position as Britain\u2019s biggest seller of music. HMV it is yet to finalise its figures for the vital 2015 festive season, but is likely to have enjoyed another robust period. Paul McGowan, chairman at HMV, said: \u201cMusic continued to perform well, buoyed by the runaway success of Adele\u2019s 25 and the continued resurgence of vinyl as the format of choice for serious music lovers. Although last year was not a stellar year for film releases, HMV has continued to outperform the market and we have much to look forward to in the months ahead with both Star Wars and Spectre hitting the shelves in 2016.\u201d Meanwhile, its former sister company Waterstones is set to report its first annual profit since the financial crisis struck. Although books are not included in the ERA\u2019s figures, Waterstones is benefitting from a similar phenomenon to HMV - a realisation among customers about the benefits of the physical products. James Daunt, the boss of Waterstones, has decided to stop selling Kindle e-readers in most Waterstones shops and is instead using that space for physical books. \u201cI always believed there would be a natural point of equilibrium with digital reading \u2013 that it would overshoot, then come back and settle down. That made intuitive sense, and that indeed has happened,\u201d Daunt told the Guardian recently. However, despite the resilience of the entertainment market, competition remains fierce among the retailers. Amazon and the supermarket chains continue to loom large over specialist chains. According to market research firm Kantar, Amazon\u2019s market share of the physical entertainment market stands at almost 22%, with Tesco second on 16% and HMV third with 12.3%. Game Digital, the video games retailer, was forced to issue a profit warning before Christmas. The company has been squeezed by rival retailers cutting the price of new consoles and games on Black Friday, the promotional event at the end of November. It also warned that gamers were not moving to the new Playstation 4 and XBox One consoles as quickly as hoped, and at the same time the market for old formats was shrinking rapidly. In addition, retailers found it difficult to shift DVDS in 2015, with sales down 15%. Fiona Keenan, strategic insight director at Kantar Worldpanel, said this decline was linked to the popularity of the cinema. She said: \u201cThe incredibly strong performance of cinema in 2015 came at the expense of new release physical video sales, which saw the biggest losses to cinema since 2012. While this impacted physical video sales in 2015, the home entertainment release of Star Wars this year will no doubt be a huge boost for the physical video market.\u201d Sales of cinema tickets hit a record level in 2015. This was primarily thanks to two films \u2013 Spectre and Star Wars: The Force Awakens \u2013 that will not be available on DVD and download services until later in 2016. The Star Wars and James Bond effect \u2013 and the continuing success of Adele \u2013 should mean that the new year carries on where 2015 left off, proving that the fightback by physical entertainment is not a blip.",

      "bodyText": "Standard Life is to vote against oil group Shell\u2019s controversial plan to take over rival BG, branding the deal \u201cvalue destructive\u201d for shareholders at a time of plunging oil prices. The high-profile move by one of the UK\u2019s largest investment funds appears to be a last-ditch attempt to rally opposition to the \u00a335bn bid at a time when Shell management is privately confident it has won over most doubters. That sense of optimism was bolstered by the influential Institutional Shareholders Services (ISS), a proxy advisory body, recommending that Shell investors support the merger which could be concluded as early as next month. Concern about the financial impact of the takeover on Shell\u2019s balance sheet has battered its share price, which dropped a further 5% today. The dangers of the deal have grown with the oil price tumbling to 11-year lows. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, said: \u201cWe have concluded that the proposed terms of the acquisition of BG are value destructive for Shell shareholders. This view is based on the downside risks to Shell\u2019s oil price assumptions plus the tax and operational risks surrounding BG\u2019s Brazilian asset base. Consequently we shall vote against the deal.\u201d Standard Life, which holds 0.4% of the A shares in Shell and 1.7 % of the B shares, said it had held meetings with the oil group to explain its views and try to get the chief executive, Ben van Beurden, to renegotiate better terms. ISS said it was understandable that Shell investors would feel \u201cdiscomfited\u201d by the significant volatility in global crude prices but added: \u201cIt is worth recognising, however, that the spot price today may be of very little value in assessing the strategic opportunity of a transaction whose benefits will be realised over decades. \u201cIn particular. because of the compelling strategic rationale, and the significant positive economics to be realised within a relatively short timeframe, support for the transaction is warranted.\u201d Van Beurden and the Shell board need a majority of its shareholders and 75% of BG investors to back the deal for it to go through. Shell declined to comment on the Standard Life statement but industry sources said the oil company had drawn comfort from SIS plus positive statements from large investors such as Aberdeen Asset Management, Old Mutual and AXA.",

      "bodyText": "A punishing week has left global stock markets nursing losses of more than $2tn in the first week of the new year after worries about China\u2019s faltering growth and turmoil on its stock exchanges reverberated around the world. Almost \u00a385bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 in its worst opening week to a year since 2000, when the dotcom bubble burst. The blue-chip index closed at 5,912.44 on Friday, down 0.7% on the day and 5.3% on the week. Repeating the pattern of last summer, sharp drops on the world\u2019s biggest stock exchanges mirrored plunging shares in China, where fresh signs of economic weakness and the prospect of a ban on share sales by major stakeholders being lifted had sparked a wave of selling by smaller investors. Moves in China\u2019s yuan currency, which authorities allowed to weaken in an apparent attempt to bolster flagging exports, heightened alarm about the state of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. Beijing mustered what analysts called its \u201cnational team\u201d to intervene and boost the yuan on Friday, offering some brief respite to markets in China and beyond. But the mood remained cautious and gains on European exchanges were short-lived. Stock markets in Germany, France and the UK all finished sharply lower over the week, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index had its worst week since 2011. In a choppy trading session on Wall Street, shares were boosted by news of stronger- than expected US jobs growth in December, but then pared gains as traders fretted about further interest rate hikes and the tough global economic outlook. With just hours to go to the closing bell in the US, global markets looked on course to have rung in 2016 with trillions of dollars of losses. By Thursday\u2019s US close, global stock markets had lost $2.23tn since the start of the year based on the S&amp;P Global Broad Market index (BMI). The losses amounted to \u201cmore than the estimated US student loan debt and 12% of the US debt,\u201d noted Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones indices. There were also sharp moves on commodity markets. The prospect of weaker global growth coupled with a supply glut pushed the price of crude oil to its lowest level for almost 12 years. The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, had risen more than 2% on Friday after China sought to boost the yuan, and its stock exchanges abandoned a new \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism that had been blamed for much of the stock market havoc. But echoing the see-saw pattern in stock markets those gains were later erased and Brent was trading at about $33 a barrel, near a low hit in 2004. With worries about a global downturn intensifying, investors off-loaded riskier shares and flocked to so-called safe haven assets such as gold and government bonds. \u201cSo much for the new year bringing some relief to the markets\u201d said credit strategists at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cWorries about China, the endless drop in oil prices and even new geopolitical tensions pounded the markets, punishing risk assets with a flight to quality that was in full swing,\u201d they wrote in a research note entitled \u201cWhat\u2019s the Chinese for \u2018ouch\u2019?\u201d Chinese stock markets were suspended twice in a week after 7% falls tripped a new circuit breaker mechanism. It had been intended to stem sharp sell-offs but in the end appeared to have the opposite effect and in a dramatic U-turn the mechanism was withdrawn just days after it had been introduced. Chinese stocks recovered by 2% on Friday after the yuan edged higher following days of depreciation that had spooked investors and fuelled capital flight out of the country. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cChina\u2019s removal of counter-productive circuit breakers, state buying and a rise in the yuan helped prevent another stock market rout and alleviated concerns that the central bank would continue the rapid devaluation of the currency.\u201d After a day of wild trading, the Shanghai composite index and the CSI 300, which comprises the biggest stocks from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, finished about 2% higher, at 3,186.78 and 3,361.56, respectively. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng added 0.6%. The latest bout of stock market turmoil presents a major challenge to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who has portayed himself as the country\u2019s top economic steward, ahead of the prime minister, Li Keqiang. Xi was reportedly livid over a humiliating stock market debacle in mid-2015, lambasting senior economic officials after he appeared on the front cover of the Economist fighting to prop up Chinese shares. Experts say the credibility of Beijing\u2019s economic policymakers has been further damaged by the latest turmoil. The Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, questioned whether Beijing could afford to keep supporting the yuan in light of its record decline in foreign reserves last month. Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC business school, said Beijing\u2019s economic flip-flopping and \u201cwild swings in policymaking\u201d had severely damaged confidence. \u201cChinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u2019t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing.\u201d",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Sports Direct issues profit warning after poor Christmas sales", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nearly half a billion pounds was wiped off the value of Sports Direct after the retailer shocked the stock market with a warning that annual profits would be \u00a340m lower than expected. Shares in the company, led by Newcastle United football club\u2019s billionaire owner Mike Ashley, plunged by more than 15% as it blamed a slide in the number of shoppers visiting high streets and unseasonably warm weather in the run-up to Christmas for a downturn in trading. The profits warning comes just a month after a Guardian investigation revealed that Sports Direct effectively pays thousands of temporary workers below the national minimum wage of \u00a36.70 an hour and subjects warehouse staff to a regime of searches and surveillance. In a stock market statement, Sports Direct said that it now expected to miss its target for underlying profits of \u00a3420m. It is forecasting that profits will now be between \u00a3380m and \u00a3420m for the year to the end of April. \u201cSince our interim results on 10 December 2015, we have seen a deterioration of trading conditions on the high street and a continuation of the unseasonal weather over the key Christmas period,\u201d the company said. Many fashion retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer and Next, have suffered a tough time in the run up to Christmas as coats and knitwear have been left on the shelves. But analysts were sceptical about weather affecting Sports Direct in the same way, given its focus on branded footwear and sports clothing, which arguably could be more in demand during a mild spell. Rival retailer JD Sports upgraded its profit expectations by \u00a310m in early December as it revealed it was enjoying \u201crelatively strong trading.\u201d Outdoor gear retailer Mountain Warehouse also revealed it had seen 28.6% rise in sales over the six weeks 3 January including a 49% surge in online sales. Tony Shiret, an analyst at Sports Direct\u2019s in-house broker Haitong, said Sports Direct was likely to have suffered from the big switch away from the high street towards online shopping over Christmas. Only 10% of its sales are online, compared with 40% for John Lewis, which enjoyed strong festive sales. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst added: \u201cSports Direct is not the most obvious victim of the weather. It is selling a bit of outerwear and footwear but not coats and jumpers. This is more to do with JD Sports which is now a preferred retailer for the big brands like Adidas and Nike and it could well be that the consumer generally sees its 50% signs as not for real and the stores are a tip. The criticism [about treatment of workers] can\u2019t be helping either,\u201d he said. Jonathan Pritchard, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said: \u201cWhilst the weather has been unhelpful, we believe that there are other major problems at play here. We have long had an issue with the range (too much own label, not enough high-quality branded product), and some mud from press articles/documentaries may have stuck to the brand.\u201d Sports Direct has faced a barrage of criticism about its treatment of workers since the Guardian published its revelations in early December, just ahead of the retailer\u2019s last trading update. The company was branded a \u201cscar on British business\u201d by the Institute of Directors, and was rounded on by its own shareholders and opposition MPs who have demanded that the FTSE 100 company be investigated by HMRC over its pay practices. The retailer\u2019s value has dived by more than \u00a31.4bn since the Guardian published its revelations on 9 December. One analyst said the company was at risk of falling out of the FTSE 100 list of the UK\u2019s largest companies if its shares continued to fall. Oliver Parry, senior corporate governance adviser at the Institute of Directors, said the deterioration in trading may focus institutional investors on the corporate governance issues at Sports Direct. \u201cThe big funds have been quite apathetic over the years,\u201d he said. Sacha Sada, director of corporate governance at L&amp;G Investment Management (LGIM), which owns a 1.5% stake in Sports Direct, said: \u201cLGIM has had governance concerns for a long time and voted against the re-election of the chairman of the board in 2014 and 2015. We will continue to engage to improve the governance of Sports Direct. LGIM believe good governance enhances shareholder value.\u201d Some other major shareholders have cut their stake in Sports Direct, including City hedge fund boss Crispin Odey. Unite regional officer Luke Primarolo, said the retailer also needed to start working with the union to improve conditions at its warehouse and fulfil its pledge to become the best high street employer after John Lewis. The business has promised to increase pay for warehouse workers and review conditions in the wake of the Guardian\u2019s revelations. \u201cToday\u2019s profit warning shows fundamental problems remain at Sports Direct from the use of zero hours contracts in its stores through to the treatment of agency workers at its main warehouse in Shirebrook,\u201d Primarolo said. Sports Direct\u2019s latest profit warning comes despite the fact that some analysts had already downgraded profit expectations slightly last month, when the company revealed worse-than-expected sales figures. In September, Sports Direct also reduced this year\u2019s profit performance target for its staff bonus scheme from \u00a3480m to \u00a3420m. The company said the target should be lowered because it had failed to make key acquisitions, not least department store House of Fraser where it lost out to a Chinese buyer. James Grzinic, an analyst at Jefferies, said he was confused why Sports Direct had issued the warning as any fall in profits from stores would be offset by a fall in bonus pay-outs to staff. He suggested Sports Direct might look for ways to protect the payouts, which go to more than 2,000 senior staff including the chief executive.",

Only 10% of its sales are online, compared with 40% for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/06/john-lewis-christmas-sales-boosted-by-online-shopping\">John Lewis, which enjoyed strong festive sales</a>.</p> <p>Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst added: \u201cSports Direct is not the most obvious victim of the weather. It is selling a bit of outerwear and footwear but not coats and jumpers. This is more to do with JD Sports which is now a preferred retailer for the big brands like Adidas and Nike and it could well be that the consumer generally sees its 50% signs as not for real and the stores are a tip. The criticism [about treatment of workers] can\u2019t be helping either,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jonathan Pritchard, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said: \u201cWhilst the weather has been unhelpful, we believe that there are other major problems at play here. We have long had an issue with the range (too much own label, not enough high-quality branded product), and some mud from press articles/documentaries may have stuck to the brand.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sports Direct has faced a barrage of criticism about its treatment of workers since the Guardian published its revelations in early December, just ahead of the retailer\u2019s last trading update.</p> <p>The company was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/sports-direct-share-price-falls-following-guardian-working-practices-revelations\">branded a \u201cscar on British business\u201d by the Institute of Directors</a>, and was rounded on by its own shareholders and opposition MPs who have demanded that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse\">FTSE</a> 100 company be investigated by HMRC over its pay practices. </p> <p>The retailer\u2019s value has dived by more than \u00a31.4bn since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">the Guardian published its revelations on 9 December</a>. One analyst said the company was at risk of falling out of the FTSE 100 list of the UK\u2019s largest companies if its shares continued to fall.</p> <p>Oliver Parry, senior corporate governance adviser at the Institute of Directors, said the deterioration in trading may focus institutional investors on the corporate governance issues at Sports Direct. \u201cThe big funds have been quite apathetic over the years,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sacha Sada, director of corporate governance at L&amp;G Investment Management (LGIM), which owns a 1.5% stake in Sports Direct, said: \u201cLGIM has had governance concerns for a long time and voted against the re-election of the chairman of the board in 2014 and 2015. We will continue to engage to improve the governance of Sports Direct. LGIM believe good governance enhances shareholder value.\u201d</p> <p>Some other major shareholders have cut their stake in Sports Direct, including City hedge fund boss Crispin Odey.</p> <p>Unite regional officer Luke Primarolo, said the retailer also needed to start working with the union to improve conditions at its warehouse and fulfil its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/31/sports-direct-pledges-10m-towards-staff-pay-rise\">pledge to become the best high street employer after John Lewis</a>. The business has promised to increase pay for warehouse workers and review conditions in the wake of the Guardian\u2019s revelations.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s profit warning shows fundamental problems remain at Sports Direct from the use of zero hours contracts in its stores through to the treatment of agency workers at its main warehouse in Shirebrook,\u201d Primarolo said.</p> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s latest profit warning comes despite the fact that some analysts had already downgraded profit expectations slightly last month, when the company revealed worse-than-expected sales figures.</p> <p>In September, Sports Direct also reduced this year\u2019s profit performance target for its staff bonus scheme from \u00a3480m to \u00a3420m. The company said the target should be lowered because it had failed to make key acquisitions, not least department store House of Fraser where it lost out to a Chinese buyer.</p> <p>James Grzinic, an analyst at Jefferies, said he was confused why Sports Direct had issued the warning as any fall in profits from stores would be offset by a fall in bonus pay-outs to staff.</p> <p>He suggested Sports Direct might look for ways to protect the payouts, which go to more than 2,000 senior staff including the chief executive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "And in Europe the FTSEurofirst 300 fell 7% over the course of the week, marking its worst weekly performance since August 2011 amid the eurozone crisis. On that, gloomy, note it\u2019s time to close the blog after what has been a tumultuous week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday to cover all the week\u2019s financial developments. To add to the New Year market gloom, the FTSE 100 has made its worst weekly start to the year since 2000. The Dow Jones Industrial had already recorded its worst ever 4-day opening at the start of the year and the modest rise so far on Friday is unlikely to improve things, unless there is a major revival before the close. A poor week for global stock markets finished in negative fashion despite earlier hopes of a recovery. The volatility and chaos caused by disappointing Chinese data and the failed attempt to control the country\u2019s stock market with circuit breakers had sent investors running for the hills this week. But a 2% rise in the Chinese market earlier on Friday, following the abandonment of the circuit breakers and some support from the authorities for the yuan, gave some hope that a better day was in prospect. Better than expected US jobs figures put an end to that, prompting talk of further US rate rises and pushing the dollar higher, and by extension the oil price lower. With all the other geopolitical problems - North Korea\u2019s possible hydrogen bomb, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran - as well as Chinese inflation data this Saturday, traders decided to take their money off the table ahead of the weekend. Market analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A degree of calm in Chinese markets overnight has done little to placate sentiment, whilst better than expected employment data out of the US is also adding to woes. As global growth projections are trimmed whilst the Federal Reserve eyes the next interest rate hike, across the board it seems as if the economy will now face sustained headwinds. So Brent crude is currently down 1.6% at $33.18 a barrel, pushing commodity companies lower again. The FTSE 100 has lost nearly \u00a385bn in value this week, recording its biggest weekly fall (5.28%) since August last year when the Chinese (yes, them again) sent ructions through global markets by devaluing the yuan. According to CNBC, the global market as measured by the S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index has lost more than $2trn this week. The final scores for the day showed: The FTSE 100 fell 41.64 points or 0.7% to 5912.44 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.31% to 9849.34 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.59% at 4333.76 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 1.58% to 19,869.49 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.66% down 8909.2 In Greece, the Athens market is 0.81% lower at 585.98 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 62 points or 0.38%. One of the reasons for the decline in markets since the initial enthusiasm for the US jobs data is the feeling that the strong figures make a rate rise more likely. The disappointing wages growth might mitigate against an early rise, but the general feeling seems to be that even dearer borrowing costs are now more likely. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Heading into the close, the FTSE 100 has given up all its gains for the day, finishing a tough week on a miserable note. After a passable performance overnight for the Chinese market, hopes were high that stock markets in Europe and the US could claw back some of their own losses. So far on this side of the pond, that has not been the case. Equity traders have been left bereft of reasons to be optimistic this week, and it looks like the China fears of the past few days will remain with us as we head into a new week. US job numbers kicked off 2016 in fine form, well ahead of estimates, but the lack of wage growth was the fly in the ointment. The fear now is that such good numbers, even with inflation worries, will encourage the Fed to continue with its planned four hikes this year, putting fresh pressure on equity markets. Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the US jobs data: It seems just like the good old days. Almost 300,000 jobs were added to payrolls in America in the last month of 2015, continuing the upward trend of recent months. The US is once again living up to its reputation for being a gigantic jobs machine. Well, perhaps. Jobs are certainly being created at a good lick and the US has an unemployment rate \u2013 5% \u2013 that the eurozone, at 10.5%, would die for. There are signs that people who had given up hope of finding work are being encouraged back into the labour market. Inevitably, this will lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to start raising interest rates and will now be forced to play catch up with a more rapid increase in the cost of borrowing than Wall Street is expecting. There is already talk of the Fed repeating December\u2019s rate hike in March. The markets may be getting ahead of themselves. Employment and unemployment are lagging indicators: they provide a guide to what has happened to an economy in the past rather than what is happening now or what will happen in the future. Some of the forward-looking indicators \u2013 for manufacturing, for example \u2013 have been worryingly weak. The Fed will certainly be looking closely at the rate of job creation in the US, but it is equally interested in what is happening to wages. And the story here is that pay pressures are extremely muted. Average hourly earnings were flat in December and were up by just 2.5% over the year as a whole, a much weaker outcome than Wall Street had been anticipating. His full analysis is here: Markets are flagging after the initial burst of enthusiasm following the US jobs data. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 51 points, the FTSE 100 is just 2 points higher while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 42 points. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Initially buoyed by a bombastic non-farm figure the global indices couldn\u2019t sustain their surge, the US open ending up not being the white knight the European markets were looking for. Perhaps the superb non-farm figure (at 292,000 against the 203,000 expected and an upwards revised 252,000 last month) was tempered by falling wage growth (at 0.0% against the 0.2% forecast) and an unchanged unemployment rate. Or perhaps investors aren\u2019t willing to take too much risk into the weekend, especially with the prospect of another awful start to Monday on the cards. Either way the Dow couldn\u2019t manage to match the gains its futures were promising, at points flagging in the same way the European indices have done for much of the day. Chinese inflation figures are due over the weekend which could prompt further market ructions next week, given what has happened in the past few days. Here\u2019s something to put the latest US jobs figures in context: Back with China, and here\u2019s a graphic showing all the recent intervention in the country\u2019s stock market: IG\u2019s Joshua Mahony is not surprised by the fluctuations in the dollar following the non-farm payroll report: But not everyone agrees. Economist Nina Skero at the Centre for Economics and Business Research does expect a US rate rise, but perhaps not until the third quarter of the year: Overall, the data add to the view that the US economic recovery steams ahead as wage gains and the unemployment rate approach long-run norms and as job creation figures, which admittedly can be rather volatile, remain high. In the aftermath of December\u2019s historic Federal Open Market Committee decision and this week\u2019s data releases perhaps the question on the minds of many is what is the future of US monetary policy? It is important to keep in mind that as one swallow does not a summer make, one rate hike does not a normalized monetary policy make. Even with the December rise interest rates in the US remain low and although the committee has restated its intention to maintain an accommodative monetary policy, it is reasonable to expect further hikes in 2016 \u2013 an expectation further strengthened by today\u2019s strong labour market data. However, this is not to say that sources of risk which could slow down the recovery do not exist, both domestically and globally. Today\u2019s labour-market release shows a participation rate of 62.6% - well below pre-crisis levels. On the global front, equity markets turmoil and the slowdown in China are among the greatest concerns. The exact pace and extent of further interest rate hikes is difficult to predict given that the FOMC itself maintains that it is data-dependent and that it will continue to make interest rate decisions based on a series of indicators that it is monitoring rather than on a pre-set schedule. Keeping in mind that the US economy is expected to perform strongly in 2016, but also that December minutes show that the FOMC wants to observe the potentially delayed impact of the rate rise before making further hikes, Cebr expects interest rates to rise to 0.75% in the third quarter of 2016. Here\u2019s someone who thinks the Federal Reserve could raise US interest rates at its March meeting despite the uninspiring wage data. Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said: Average hourly earnings were only flat between November and December. But thanks to a positive basis effect, the year on year rate ticked up to 2.5% from 2.3%. But while the Fed has said at a number of recent occasions that it puts more emphasis on the actual development of inflation rates when determining the appropriate path for short-term interest rates, we think that the unambiguous display of strength in the labor market will continue to bolster the confidence of FOMC members that (a) consumer spending will continue to power the US economy ahead \u2013 despite global headwinds, and (b) that faster wage gains will eventually lift domestic inflation rates. Accordingly, we continue to expect three rate hikes for 2016, with the next one coming at the March meeting. On the jobs numbers themselves he said: To be sure, the labor market in the fourth quarter of 2015 most likely benefited from two special factors. First, there was a technical rebound in October, after the August and September numbers disappointed (in part due to seasonal adjustment issues). And in November and December, the unusually mild winter weather clearly supported employment in weather-sensitive areas, notably construction. There is, however, in our view no reason at all to question the underlying message of today\u2019s and the previous couple of employment reports: The US labor market continues to be red-hot despite daily reports of global economic headwinds and financial market turmoil. The reason for this resilience \u2013 as highlighted at several occasions \u2013 is that most of the value added and of the job creation in the US occurs in the services sector, which is barely affected by global developments. And this trend strengthened further in 2015. After in 2014 81% of jobs were created in services, this number rose to a whopping 94% in 2015; with another 10% coming from the construction sector! That leaves a very small share of the labor market exposed to the adverse impacts of global economic headwinds and low oil prices. As expected after the better than expected US jobs figures, Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 110 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.7%. Here\u2019s our story on the US non-farm payrolls: More detail on the US jobs: On the mining sector, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said: Employment in mining continued to decline in December (-8,000). After adding 41,000 jobs in 2014, mining lost 129,000 jobs in 2015, with most of the loss in support activities for mining. Further consideration of the wages data - and the implications for the Federal Reserve to hold fire on another rate rise - has seen the dollar lose some of its initial strength in the wake of the figures. Against the pound, the US currency is at $1.4572 compared to $1.4556 earlier. On the wages figures, Alex Lydall at Foenix Partners said: Not all components were positive in today\u2019s payroll print with Average Hourly Earnings being a particular concern falling 0.2% below forecasts. More jobs being created can only be seen as good news, but with hourly earnings lagging, labour cost inflation is still a slight concern to Janet Yellen. The strong payrolls number has vindicated the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise rates in December, said Rob Carnell at ING Bank, but the next increase may not come until June. He said: However, aside from this strong headline, there is not much else to get too excited about. The unemployment rate stood unchanged at 5.0%, still very low by any standards. One considerable disappointment in this survey, and perhaps a more important one as far as the pace of future fed hikes is concerned, is the wages figures. These grew at only a 2.5% year on year rise, and were flat over the month in December. Consensus had been looking for a modest 0.2% month on month increase, which would have taken wages into a range they had not inhabited since before the financial crisis. Instead, wages still seem to be struggling to rise. There was also no change in the average workweek, which tends to support the notion that wage pressures remain subdued, as increased hours frequently indicate a tight labour market and building wage pressures. Consequently, and even with the strong headline payrolls figure, we don\u2019t think these figures support a March rate hike, talk of which had been building over the past week following strong non-manufacturing ISM and ADP data. Our house forecast for the next hike in June is still, we think, a more likely outcome. Wages in the US were also on the rise, the figures show, but perhaps not enough for another interest rate hike at the Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting. The year on year gain was 2.5% in December compares to 2.3% in November, and is expected to pick up further as employment increases. However the average hourly earnings figure dropped a cent in December. The full US jobs report is here. Here are the charts showing the US job gains and unemployment rate: The jobs data may well have vindicated the Fed\u2019s rate decision, but there is no reason to be complacent, suggests Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com. He said: It\u2019s far too soon to know definitively if Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Co. made the right decision in raising interest rates last month. However, December\u2019s well above expected non-farm payroll figures will confirm her assessment that the world\u2019s biggest economy is in rude health. Despite the positive jobs figures, there are plenty of challenges on the horizon for Yellen to navigate, not least depressed oil prices and the Chinese economy playing havoc with exchanges the world over. Observers will be hoping that next week\u2019s US retail sales figures show a bumper holiday trading period. The better than expected US jobs data could well prompt further rate rises this year, and this has pushed the dollar higher again. Sterling has hit the day\u2019s low of $1.4556 , down from $1.4590 beforehand, while the euro has fallen around 1%. Markets seem to like the news. The FTSE 100 is now up 47 points and is back over 6000, Germany\u2019s Dax has climbed 0.3% and France\u2019s Cac has come off its lows, down 0.16%. US futures are now showing a 147 point opening on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The jobless rate however has come in line with forecasts at 5%. November\u2019s jobs figure has been revised up from 211,000 to 252,000 and October\u2019s from 298,000 to 307,000. The non-farm payroll numbers for December showed a 292,000 rise compared to expectations of 200,000. That seems to back up the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise interest rates last month. Our Financial editor, Nils Pratley, has kicked the tires on Sports Direct\u2019s profit warning. His verdict - the City is changing its view of Mike Ashley\u2019s empire, fast. And can the weather really be blamed? Should a mild winter really upset trading at a sportswear chain? Sports Direct is not in the coats and jumpers business in the way that Marks &amp; Spencer and Next are. Warm temperatures, in theory, might even encourage better sales of trainers and tracksuits than freezing conditions. Doesn\u2019t Sports Direct have a strong online business to capture the switch to online shopping? And surely the weather hasn\u2019t changed radically since management said four weeks ago it remained confident of achieving top-line profits of \u00a3420m in the current financial year; now it says anything between \u00a3380m and \u00a3420m is possible. After this turbulent week, many in the City and on Wall Street just hope the US jobs report will be undramatic: It\u2019s nearly time for the final major piece of economic data of the week -- the latest US jobs report for December. Economists expect around 200,000 new jobs were created last month: On a normal week, the Non-Farm Payroll is the main event. Today, it feels less important compared to the ructions over China. It\u2019s also slightly less dramatic, given that the Federal Reserve took the plunge and raised interest rates last month. Of course, if Non-Farm is much weaker than expected, it could fuel concerns that the Fed hiked too early. Ransquawk have helpfully rounded up the Wall Street guesstimates: Wise heads in the City say that we shouldn\u2019t fixate on the exchange rate between the yuan and the US dollar. Instead, we should look at how the yuan is shaping up against a basket of other currencies (who will also have suffered from the stronger dollar too) And as these charts shows, China\u2019s currency has been more stable on this basis:: So, the time to panic might be when the trade-weighed yuan dives, as that would suggest Beijing was struggling to handle the situation. Senior City economist Stephen Lewis has issued a long note on China today, explaining why there is such anxiety about China\u2019s financial stability, and the consequences for the global economy if things turn very sour. I\u2019ve cropped out some highlights below, as it provides some useful insight into the situation. Lewis points out that Beijing\u2019s attempts to rebalance its economy away from manufacturing and into consumption will inevitably hurt growth: It should be no surprise that a rapidly growing industrial economy such as China\u2019s is drifting into choppy financial waters. The advanced economies faced similar challenges at corresponding stages in their development. But, in coping with the consequences of financial turbulence, the advanced economies often suffered significant losses of output relative to potential. The Beijing authorities are professedly seeking to change China\u2019s economic growth model from one which depends on exports and capital investment to one more firmly based on domestic consumption. But they may be over-estimating the extent to which politicians can choose how their economies grow. Since curbing growth in some sectors is usually easier than boosting it in others, the danger is that the attempt to re-orient the economy will result in overall weaker growth This is one reason, which seems to be widely acknowledged, why China\u2019s future growth could well fall short not only of recent rates but even of the Beijing authorities\u2019 more conservative projections for the years to come. Then there are the demographic problems, which prompted the abolition of the \u201cOne child per family\u201d rule: By 2050, those aged 65 or over could well stand at 38% of the labour force, slightly less favourable even than Japan\u2019s present ratio. There could be ameliorating circumstances for China. There may be scope for more migration from the countryside to urban centres without loss of agricultural production, though much less than there used to be. There will very likely be support to China\u2019s GDP growth from a shift in the urban workforce from low-productivity activities to higher-productivity occupations. Further, China would perhaps be less opposed on cultural grounds than Japan to immigrant labour, though there have been no moves in that direction yet. Indeed, the ruling Communist Party\u2019s highly developed sense of self-preservation might be expected to resist any disturbance of the status quo. At the same time, in the nearer term, China faces a unique problem, the result of the recent abandonment of the one-child policy in favour of a two-child policy. To the extent that this measure is effective in raising the birth rate, it will temporarily boost the dependency ratio, that is, the proportion that the non-working population, old and young, bears to those of working age. Those who are working will need to increase their output merely to meet the needs of a growing non-active population. There will likely be a reduced margin of savings to finance capital investment and thereby to support future growth. And then there\u2019s the geopolitics,... The region is also a potential war-zone in a way that neither North America nor even Europe appears to be at the moment. Reports this week that North Korea has tested a hydrogen bomb is a reminder of the severity of the threat. Beyond the North Korean danger, both the East China Sea and the South China Sea are possible flashpoints. In the former area, there was a stand-off between Japan and China over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) islands through most of last year. But on 20 December an armed Chinese coast-guard vessel entered territorial waters that Japan claims around the islands. In response to these and other regional tensions, the Japanese government has proposed for the fiscal 2016/17 year a 1.5% increase in military spending to a highest-ever level. This is significant in view of the pressure to achieve reductions in other spending programmes. The Japanese government had been allowed, under the nation\u2019s post-war constitution, the right of self-defence, which would have covered operations around the Senkaku islands, but Mr Abe nevertheless pressed for, and in September secured, an amendment that would allow Japan to afford military help to allies. This strongly suggests that the Abe government foresees the possibility of Japan taking part in the resistance to what several nations in the region regard as Beijing\u2019s aggressive strategy in the South China Sea. It seems a long time since the Spratly islands first hit the headlines. It was as long ago as 1999 that a Filipino naval ship deliberately ran aground on one of those islands to establish a claim to the archipelago. Last year, in a dramatic development, it became clear that China was determinedly seeking to enforce its own title to the area when it built an artificial island on the foundation of the Mischief Reef and went on to claim, in contravention of UN rules, territorial waters around that construction. The US Navy has since sought to enforce freedom of the seas by disregarding China\u2019s pretensions, thereby precipitating low-level exchanges with China\u2019s ships. Vietnam also believes it has interests to defend in the South China Sea. In an ominous development, its government announced on 23 December that it would be taking delivery from Russia of two more Kilo-class submarines to supplement the four it already deploys. These vessels are reckoned to be especially effective in relatively shallow waters (the Iranian navy has three of them). Vietnam\u2019s army has put troop concentrations in the northern province on the border with China under \u2018high combat readiness\u2019. This appears to be a defensive move. But investors should note that Vietnam\u2019s defence doctrine is not based on attacking China\u2019s naval forces head-on, a contest that Vietnam could hardly expect to win. Rather, in the event of hostilities, the aim of the strategists in Hanoi would be to use the submarines to prey on merchant shipping heading to and from Chinese ports through the South China Sea. Their calculation is that the resulting prohibitive cost of freight insurance, or indeed the unwillingness of insurers to provide cover at all, would cripple China\u2019s trade and economic activity. It could also topple China\u2019s financial system, an objective looking less fanciful in the light of this week\u2019s evidence of fragility. Given Vietnam\u2019s record in getting the better of super-powers, this strategic view should perhaps be taken more seriously than investors seem prepared to do at the moment. There\u2019s drama in the City -- high street retailer Sports Direct has issued a profits warning. The company admitted that it could miss its target of \u00a3420m profits by up to \u00a340m, following weak sales since its last financial results on 10 December. It blamed: \u201ca deterioration of trading conditions on the high street and a continuation of the unseasonal weather over the key Christmas period\u201d. Shares are down around 5%, making it the biggest faller in London. Several other retailers have blamed the warm weather recently - including Next and Marks &amp; Spencer. So it\u2019s very plausible that demand for Sports Direct parka coats have fallen recently. But demand for other kit might have softened the blow? A month ago, The Guardian exposed working conditions at Sports Direct, where workers are chivvied by tannoy to work faster, and underwent searches after their shift was over. With trading conditions worsening, the company\u2019s shareholders have a lot to ponder... The European stock market rally is petering out. Germany\u2019s stock market is now in the red today: Now this is interesting.. China\u2019s centraal bank has issued a statement, pledging to \u201cfurther liberalise\u201d interest rates. Reuters has more details: The central bank also said it would make the yuan more international, keep the currency basically stable, further improve the currency formation mechanism and deepen reforms of the foreign exchange management system and financial institutions. The central bank will use medium-term loans, and pledged supplementary loans and credit policies to support key areas of the economy. The central bank also said it would maintain prudent monetary policy and flexibly use monetary policy tools to keep adequate liquidity in the banking system. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s what you need to know.... A sense of calm has returned to global stock markets today, following the worst start to a new year on record. But China\u2019s economy remains a big fear, that could well dominate most of this year. China\u2019s market has stabilised, closing 2% higher. Beijing authorities are thought to have been buying up shares, in an attempt to restore confidence. Traders were also encouraged that the yuan was fixed at a higher level today, easing fears of a currency war.But confidence in the Chinese authorities has been hit by this week\u2019s drama: Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC business school, said: \u201cChinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are. The constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u2019t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing.\u201d More here: European stocks are all in the green today, ending a wild week on a stronger note. Jasper Lawler of CMC Market says: A rebound in Chinese shares and the price of oil provided some relief for shares in Europe on Friday after a brutal first week of the year. But despite the recovery, world markets have still suffered a remarkably poor start to the year. $4trn has been wiped off global shares, according to Bloomberg A handy reminder of how markets began 2016: When financial historians look back at this period, they will probably conclude that China\u2019s ill-fated and short-lived circuit breaker was not the best idea ever created. It was meant to prevent mayhem, by briefly suspending trading when the market fell 5% and closing it off for the day if it lost another 2%. But as we saw on Monday, and Thursday, it actually sparked crashes as investors rushed to sell shares at the first sign that the market was going down. So, full credit to Beijing for culling it yesterday - a move that was immortalised by the FT: Alastair McCaig of IG says the abolishment of the circuit breaker helped Chinese shares to rise today. Human psychology has had a strong hand to play in the way Chinese markets have behaved. The removal of the system that suspends the market should it fall too much has, ironically, seen the fear of entrapment reduced with Asian investors. Britain could lose almost 1% of global economic output if China\u2019s economy suffers a serious hard landing, according to analysis from Oxford Economics. And that would actually mean the UK gets off relatively lightly, compared to the pain which emerging markets would suffer. Over in Hong Kong, investors are catching their breath after the worst new year week since 2000. The Hang Seng index closed higher today, up 0.6%. But heavy losses earlier this week mean it lost 6.6% so far this year. Dr Nikos Paltalidis, lecturer in Finance at Durham University Business School, also reckons fears over China\u2019s stock market are overblown. He points out that shares did soar by 50% last year - a clear sign of a speculative bubble that is now deflating. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the selloff won\u2019t cause serious consequences. Paltalidis says: \u201cThe sudden wave of concern about China\u2019s looming economic catastrophe is overblown. However, the burst of the stock market bubble, increases the concern about the knock on effect on the real-estate market. Chinese policymakers might need to respond with additional currency devaluation, and if things get worse, some form of quantitative easing, to avoid a collapse in asset prices. Despite today\u2019s small recovery, European stock markets are on track for their worst week since last August\u2019s rout (which was also triggered by China). Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says investors have adopted \u201cthe brace position\u201d this week:, wiping around 5% off the major indices. What should have been a perky start to 2016, with New Year optimism underpinned by portfolio positioning as investors buy stocks, has been eclipsed by ongoing concerns on global growth, the oil price and negative geopolitical developments. The general souring of sentiment had been exacerbated by the Chinese circuit breakers, along with Fed minutes which questioned the strength of belief in the December hike and sellers apparently pushing against an open door.\u201d One of Angela Merkel\u2019s top allies has called for calm over China. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Michael Fuchs argued that the panic over China\u2019s stock markets has been overdone. I do believe that China is getting back on track. It is still tracking a 7% growth rate - 7% growth is a decent number.... I\u2019m not so pessimistic that China is going to be in a deep crisis. But Fuchs also warned that German industry, such as car markets and chemicals producers, will suffer if China\u2019s economy weakens. There\u2019s a sense of relief in the foreign exchange markets this morning, as emerging market currencies recover. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, has the details: Investors\u2019 mood brightened after two days of aggressive selling after China suspended circuit-breakers that shut off stock market trade after just 14 minutes of activity yesterday and set the daily Yuan fix a bit higher. The risk-geared Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars outperformed while the safety-linked Japanese Yen proved weakest on the session. In a few weeks Beijing will have a window of opportunity to take fresh steps to shore up its economy: After 30 minutes of trading, European markets are all showing small gains: This week\u2019s ructions have not improved Beijing\u2019s reputation for economic competence. As Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services puts it: As we have argued before, China\u2019s authorities have clearly bitten far more than they can chew in their markets and economy reform efforts, with a clear sense that they are at best fumbling in the dark emerging. He also warns that the current calm in the markets is probably only \u201ctransitory\u201d. The oil price is rising this morning, in another signal that markets are a little calmer this morning. Brent crude has gained 1.5% to $34.26 per barrel, having hit fresh 11-year lows yesterday. Mining stocks are recovering some ground, with commodity trader Glencore up 2.3% and Rio Tinto up 1.5%. Again, a small move - as Accendo Markets\u2019 Mike van Dulken points out: Europe\u2019s stock markets are open, and showing some small gains in early trading. The FTSE 100 has risen by 20 points, or 0.3%, to 5974, while Germany\u2019s DAX is 0.4% higher. That\u2019s pretty small potatoes, given the Footsie lost 2% yesterday while the DAX shed 3%. How much market value has been destroyed in this week\u2019s stock market rout? According to CNBC\u2019s Jacob Pramuk, we have lost.....(puts on Dr Evil voice) two trillion dollars! He explains: The S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index, which tracks global stock performance, has lost $2.23 trillion in market value this year. For perspective, the total trumps estimated U.S. student loan debt of more than $1 trillion and would represent roughly 12 percent of U.S. government debt. But that might not capture the full scale of the rout. Bloomberg\u2019s widest measure of listed companies shows a four trillion dollar loss: The Financial Times also flags up that Beijing authorities appears to be buying shares today: By lunch time the indices were up, amid reports that China\u2019s state-backed funds were once again buying up shares On Thursday the securities regulator said that its promulgation of permanent rules restricting stock sales by large shareholders did not indicate that the \u201cnational team\u201d is withdrawing from the market. \u201cIts market stability function will not change,\u201d the agency said. The statement marks a shift in tone from late August, when the regulator said that the national team would halt regular share purchases. More here: China markets motor higher in choppy trading Good morning from London, where City traders are arriving at their desks and looking nervously at developments in Asia overnight. And the latest news is that the Chinese market has just closed up for the day. The Shanghai composite index jumped 2%, or 61 points, to finish at 3,186 points, following the wild ride which Martin has been tracking through this blog. It does appear that China\u2019s state-backed funds have been active in the market, buying up shares and giving retail investors a little confidence. Signs that Beijing has been intervening to support the yuan have helped shore up confidence too. Yesterday\u2019s decision to abandon China\u2019s new circuit-breaker rules has also paid off (they had been fuelling the crisis, as investors were rushing ditch shares before the market fell 7% and was shut for the day). But it really has been a turbulent start to the year. China\u2019s stock market has lost 10% of its value this week - the worst run since the Great Fall of China last summer. It\u2019s time for me to sign off from Sydney and pass you over seamlessly to Graeme Wearden in London for what should be an interesting day. Thanks for following us. While not a great start to the year for the Japanese market. This is how the European opening looks. Still a bit of a mixed bag. Associated Press has just put together a thought-provoking three reasons for concern about the Chinese economy. A tumbling currency which has unnerved world markets but which is probably up to 8% overvalued. Transition to an economy based less on cheap manufacturing and more on consumer spending and services. Mismanagement such as poor communication and bungled execution of policies such as the ill-fated \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d have aggravated an already worsening situation. Japan has just closed down at an estimated cost this week of $320bn in market capitalisation. Ouch. Better day so far in Shanghai and Shenzen as this chart on the CSI300. While this picture of the yuan\u2019s devaluation tells us the story from a different angle. China\u2019s \u201cnational team\u201d appears to have steadied the economic ship after state intervention to prop up the yuan prompted a rally in Chinese stocks The bluechip CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite were up 3% in afternoon trade Elsewhere the Nikkei was down 0.45% and the Australian market finished 0.39% lower. Mixed picture from European futures trade ahead of the open Questions about sustainability of Chinese policy from Japanese finance minister Oil has risen off 12-year lows to $34.31 a barrel but key metals such as copper and nickel still suffering For a full story on the day\u2019s developments so far, my colleague Tom Phillips has just filed this report from Beijing: In another snippet from Tom\u2019s report, there are rumours that the head of the Chinese regulator, Xiao Gan, will be resigning tomorrow. IG analyst Angus Nicholson said in a note today that: Confidence in China\u2019s ability to manage their capital markets has only been further damaged after they announced the removal of their \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d after only being in place for four days (sending the market limit down 50% of the time) and rumours circulating that CSRC head Xiao Gang would be resigning tomorrow. We\u2019ll try to find out more about that as the day goes on. In broader economic news, a strong jobs figure is expected from the US later today. The magnificently named non-farm payrolls are due on Friday lunchtime US time and are expected to show that employers likely maintained a fairly strong pace of hiring in December. Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 200,000 jobs, just a slight step down from the 211,000 created in November, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That puts unemployment at around 5% and might further calm market nerves. Also to some extent justifies the Federal Reserve decision to tighten monetary policy last month. Back to the Beijing competence theme with the Wall Street Journal weighing in... The ASX/S&amp;P 200 index has closed below 5000 points after a sixth straight session in the red. The benchmark was 19.5 points, or 0.39%, lower at 4,990.8, while the broader All Ordinaries index was down 19.4 points, or 0.38 per cent, at 5,049.4, Australian Associated Press reports. My colleague in Beijing, Tom Phillips, says China has mustered the \u201cnational team\u201d to fight to avoid the kind of stock market turmoil that left president Xi Jinping embarrassed last year. Tom\u2019s full report will be on the website soon but he quotes Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC Business School, saying that Beijing\u2019s economic flip-flopping and \u201cwild swings in policymaking\u201d had severely damaged confidence. Chinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are. The constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u2019t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing. And here\u2019s a European view: A couple of hours to go before trading opens in Europe and it\u2019s a mixed picture about what is going to happen there. According to IG, the FTSE 100 will open up 13 points while the Dax in Geramy looks likely to open down 19 points. Some straighter business news out of China today shows that demand for electric cars is growing. BYD, a Chinese carmaker backed by Warren Buffett\u2019s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, raised its 2015 profit estimate to a five-year high, citing strong demand for its electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, Reuters has reported. Government policy has helped boost demand, it said. Despite a slowing economy and volatile financial markets, Chinese automakers such as BYD and Geely Automobile Holdings have flagged bumper profits for 2015, boosted by favourable government policies and consumer preferences that stoked demand for their products. BYD said late on Thursday it expects net profit attributable to shareholders to climb between 518% and 557% for 2015, compared with an earlier forecast of a rise in the range of 435% to 481%. Nerves do seem to have been settled by the PBOC\u2019s yuan intervention/fix policy. The steps today to fix the yuan firmer and then get state-owned banks to prop up the offshore yuan value look contradictory in the light of previous days\u2019 actions. But in the absence of the circuit breaker it\u2019s done the trick for now. The CSI300 and Shanghai Comp have paused for lunch up 2.75% and 2.39% respectively. The Nikkei is up a smidgeon but the ASX is still trailing at 0.53% down But Beijing\u2019s policy still looks a bit cack-handed to some: It\u2019s a good day for charts. Expert opinion is quite divided about the state of play in China. Tian Weidong, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities in Shanghai put what might be described as the party line: The market is back to normal Investors can buy and sell as they wish. Under the circuit breaker mechanism, the market was suffocated. But other were a little more nuanced in their assessment of a day\u2019s trading that hs seen the Chinese markets climb back into positive territory despite the lack of circuit breaker. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, said China\u2019s decision to suspend a stock circuit breaker made sense, but the implementation and timing did not. China realized that it had very tight limits on the markets, he told Bloomberg, which did more harm than good. They realised this, which is good news. The bad news is they took it off at a very peculiar time and did so without a whole set of compensating measures. The mainland Chinese markets are coming up for their lunch break, so it\u2019s a good time to check on the scoreboard. Asia Pacific markets are all up, except Australia. Nikkei up 0.39% (at lunch) CSI300 up 2.8% Shanghai Composite up 2.2% ASX/S&amp;P 200 down 0.43% Hang Seng up 2.2% Kospi up 0.08% Oil may have rallied a bit but it\u2019s still a poor outlook for prices of other industrial commodities. London Copper has dropped 1% to $4,480 a tonne this afternoon, nearing 2009 lows. Nickel fell 2%, while lead and zinc eased nearly 1%. None of that is great for the Australian-Anglo mining behemoth BHP Billiton which is down again by 0.43% this afternoon on the Australian stock market. Rio Tinto, which is not exposed to oil prices in the same way, is up more than 1.5%. And Australian gold producers are doing well out of the chaos. The precious metal rose to a two-month high of $1,113.2, a gain of 4.9 percent so far this year. The Japanese finance minister Taro Aso has warned that the Chinese might find it hard to continue supporting the yuan given the decline in its foreign currency reserves revealed on Thursday. Aso said Tokyo that further declines could trigger further capital flight from China and potentially set off competitive currency devaluations in other countries. Foreign exchange reserves have already fallen this much due to China\u2019s purchases of yuan to support its own currency, so it could be difficult to continue. China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves fell $512.66 billion in 2015 to $3.33 trillion, central bank data showed on Thursday. $107.9 billion was accounted for in December alone. Reuters quotes a trader at a European bank in Shanghai that state-owned banks were offering dollar liquidity at 6.59 yuan per dollar in an attempt to push it higher. But it\u2019s confused picture, not helped by the difference in the onshore and offshore value of the yuan. Reuters explains what happened after the PBOC set the yuan at 6.5636 today, with the currency moving towards that fix from an overnight close of 6.5929 backed by state-owned banks\u2019 intervention: The onshore yuan recovered to 6.5887 in morning trade, while the offshore yuan was about 1.4 percent weaker at 6.6798, narrowing a spread that reached around 2 percent a day earlier, making the central bank\u2019s currency management task more complicated. After its sharply lower fix on Thursday, the PBOC had later sown confusion by reportedly intervening heavily to defend the yuan in offshore trade, reversing a decline of more than 1 percent that took it to a record low of 6.7600 per dollar. That left dealers at a loss to know what the central bank\u2019s aims were. \u201cThe sharp drop has led to speculation that China is letting go of the reins on the CNY (yuan), or perhaps targeting faster depreciation to reach an \u2018equilibrium\u2019 level,\u201d wrote analysts at Barclays, while conceding that no one was really sure. The Chinese central bank, the PBOC, is intervening to support the yuan, according to Reuters. The global oil benchmark, Brent crude, has rallied 2% today after China boosted the yuan. Brent had risen 56 cents to $34.31 a barrel as of 12.50 AEDT (0150 GMT), having hit $34.72 earlier. It settled down 48 cents at $33.75 in the previous session, after marking $32.16, a level last seen in April 2004. US crude was trading 63c higher at $33.90 a barrel. It\u2019s not easy to keep track this morning but here are the main points. Asia Pacific has seen wild trading on the main stock markets amid continued uncertainty and doubts about Chinese policy The People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s decision to fix the yuan firmer initially boosted equities after a nervous start But trading has been volatile: Shanghai Composite and CSI300 index both more than 1% higher after first lurching up, then down. Nikkei up 0.3%; ASX/S&amp;P 200 down 0.5%; Kospi up 0.16%; Hang Seng up 1.09% Oil rises off 12-year lows $34.31 a barrel Aussie dollar rises, while Japanese yen drops Australian retail sales met expectations with 0.4% growth in November It should be said at this point that the volatility of the Chinese markets is much more significant for what it tells us about policy-making in Beijing than the intrinsic importance of the numbers. Most people accept that the share prices in China are totally overvalued and must be allowed to fall. But it\u2019s the disorderly manner in which this is happening which makes it interesting. My colleague Nils Pratley wrote on Monday that Beijing risked making the same mistakes this week as they did in the northern summer by stopping prices finding their natural level. Read what Nils had to say here. It\u2019s pretty much come to pass: Are you keeping up at the back? It\u2019s a confused picture today and no mistake. The chart in this tweet is quite helpful though. Thanks to Patrick McGee of the FT. Traders were following China\u2019s lead upwards. But the Chinese markets are all over the place. After an early rally, the Shanghai Composite index and the CSI300 index of leading shares are heading south again. How low will they go? Decent Australian retail sales for November helped boost the ASX. They were up 0.4% boosted by a 1% rise in the cafes and restaurants category, yet proof if any were needed that Australians just love to eat out. Household goods sales increased by 0.9%. Total retail spending was $24.77bn in November, up from $24.66bn in October, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. Stock markets have rallied across Asia Pacific. The Nikkei is down just 0.24%, while the ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia is now into positive territory. It\u2019s the first time the PBOC has fixed the yuan stronger in nine days. A lower number equals a stronger fix because it relates to what it takes to buy one US dollar. The People\u2019s Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.5636 per dollar prior to market open, firmer than the previous fix of 6.5646, and firmer than the previous day\u2019s closing quote 6.5929. That is the first time the PBOC has firmed the midpoint against the dollar in 9 trading days, after it allowed the biggest fall in the yuan in five months on Thursday, pressuring regional currencies and sending global stock markets tumbling as investors feared it would trigger competitive devaluations. The Australian dollar is an immediate beneficiary of this stronger yuan fix. The Aussie has gained almost half a cent in the last 10 minutes and is now buying US70.60c. Equities following upwards. The yuan fix is a good deal more stabilising than previous ones this week. Last night\u2019s close was 6.5929 to the US dollar which means the PBOC has opted for a more confidence-boosting currency level for now. Yuan fixed at 6.5636 Only a few minutes before the People\u2019s Bank of China announces today\u2019s fix for the yuan. A weaker than expected fix has twice triggered market crashes this week so this is going to be a key moment. Yesterday China published figures for foreign reserves which showed it was burning through cash to prop up the yuan. So will they stick or twist today? Good morning and welcome to the live blog. It\u2019s been another lively morning on the financial markets and it\u2019s tense ahead of the opening of the Chinese mainland markets at 12.30 AEDT. The Chinese regulator has scrapped its controversial \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d mechanism which has been triggered twice this week when losses hit 7%, forcing the markets to cease trading. Added to the continued devaluation of the yuan, traders around the world have drawn the conclusion that the Chinese authorities know something about the state of their economy that fairly rosy official figures are not showing. So will prices be allowed to fall to a fair value after six months of restrictions on sales? Or will the state instead intervene with mass buying of stocks? Perhaps they will try to moderate the yuan\u2019s recent devaluation in order to boost confidence? Meanwhile, the market in Australia \u2013 always the first major market to face the new ball, as it were \u2013 has fallen more than 1%. More here:",

The volatility and chaos caused by disappointing Chinese data and the failed attempt to control the country\u2019s stock market with circuit breakers had sent investors running for the hills this week. But a 2% rise in the Chinese market earlier on Friday, following the abandonment of the circuit breakers and some support from the authorities for the yuan, gave some hope that a better day was in prospect.</p> <p>Better than expected US jobs figures put an end to that, prompting talk of further US rate rises and pushing the dollar higher, and by extension the oil price lower. With all the other geopolitical problems - North Korea\u2019s possible hydrogen bomb, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran - as well as Chinese inflation data this Saturday, traders decided to take their money off the table ahead of the weekend.</p> <p>Market analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A degree of calm in Chinese markets overnight has done little to placate sentiment, whilst better than expected employment data out of the US is also adding to woes.

The disappointing wages growth might mitigate against an early rise, but the general feeling seems to be that even dearer borrowing costs are now more likely. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Heading into the close, the FTSE 100 has given up all its gains for the day, finishing a tough week on a miserable note.</p> <p>After a passable performance overnight for the Chinese market, hopes were high that stock markets in Europe and the US could claw back some of their own losses. So far on this side of the pond, that has not been the case.</p> <p>Equity traders have been left bereft of reasons to be optimistic this week, and it looks like the China fears of the past few days will remain with us as we head into a new week. US job numbers kicked off 2016 in fine form, well ahead of estimates, but the lack of wage growth was the fly in the ointment. The fear now is that such good numbers, even with inflation worries, will encourage the Fed to continue with its planned four hikes this year, putting fresh pressure on equity markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fd732e4b0600201f49158\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T15:36:59.203Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the US jobs data:</p> <blockquote> <p>It seems just like the good old days. Almost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/us-jobs-report-december-2015-economy-jobs\">300,000 jobs were added to payrolls in America in the last month of 2015</a>, continuing the upward trend of recent months. The US is once again living up to its reputation for being a gigantic jobs machine.</p> <p>Well, perhaps. Jobs are certainly being created at a good lick and the US has an unemployment rate \u2013 5% \u2013 that the eurozone, at 10.5%, would die for. There are signs that people who had given up hope of finding work are being encouraged back into the labour market.</p> <p>Inevitably, this will lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to start raising interest rates and will now be forced to play catch up with a more rapid increase in the cost of borrowing than Wall Street is expecting. There is already talk of the Fed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">repeating December\u2019s rate hike</a> in March.</p> <p>The markets may be getting ahead of themselves. Employment and unemployment are lagging indicators: they provide a guide to what has happened to an economy in the past rather than what is happening now or what will happen in the future. Some of the forward-looking indicators \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKBN0UI1GM20160104\">for manufacturing, for example</a> \u2013 have been worryingly weak.</p> <p>The Fed will certainly be looking closely at the rate of job creation in the US, but it is equally interested in what is happening to wages. And the story here is that pay pressures are extremely muted. Average hourly earnings were flat in December and were up by just 2.5% over the year as a whole, a much weaker outcome than Wall Street had been anticipating. </p> </blockquote> <p>His full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jan/08/us-employment-up-wages-static\">US employment is up, wages are static.

Or perhaps investors aren\u2019t willing to take too much risk into the weekend, especially with the prospect of another awful start to Monday on the cards. Either way the Dow couldn\u2019t manage to match the gains its futures were promising, at points flagging in the same way the European indices have done for much of the day. </p> </blockquote> <p>Chinese inflation figures are due over the weekend which could prompt further market ructions next week, given what has happened in the past few days.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fd0c6e4b0d22ca1a4c038\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T15:09:15.813Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s something to put the latest US jobs figures in context:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Convertbond/statuses/685476742056796161\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US Unemployment Rate&#10;&#10;Dec 2015: 5%&#10;Dec 2007: 5%&#10;&#10;Full Time Jobs&#10;&#10;2015: 122.8m&#10;2008: 123.2m&#10;&#10;Population +15m&#10;&#10;BLS data&#10;&#10;(2)</p>&mdash; Lawrence McDonald (@Convertbond) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Convertbond/status/685476742056796161\">January 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fcf17e4b0a0fd811ab717\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T15:03:18.253Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with China, and here\u2019s a graphic showing all the recent intervention in the country\u2019s stock market:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a447d9ea07908164cb55a6a86c9b24e9f476fa7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a447d9ea07908164cb55a6a86c9b24e9f476fa7e/0_0_1110_601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese intervention in the stock market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"541\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese intervention in the stock market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RBS Macro Credit Research: Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/StockTwits/statuses/685472910711107584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"hidden\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What else can the PBOC do? \ud83e\udd14&#10;&#10;How China has intervened in its stock market: <a href=\"https://t.co/EzMRSeYKRf\">https://t.co/EzMRSeYKRf</a>&#10;&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ASHR&amp;src=ctag\">$ASHR</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FXI&amp;src=ctag\">$FXI</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1grfJwMHMq\">pic.twitter.com/1grfJwMHMq</a></p>&mdash; StockTwits (@StockTwits) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StockTwits/status/685472910711107584\">January 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fce70e4b0d22ca1a4bf19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:58:00.964Z\">2.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>IG\u2019s Joshua Mahony is not surprised by the fluctuations in the dollar following the non-farm payroll report:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JMahony_IG/statuses/685473185026994178\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That dollar rally didnt last too long.

Economist Nina Skero at the Centre for Economics and Business Research does expect a US rate rise, but perhaps not until the third quarter of the year:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Overall, the data add to the view that the US economic recovery steams ahead as wage gains and the unemployment rate approach long-run norms and as job creation figures, which admittedly can be rather volatile, remain high.</p> <p>In the aftermath of December\u2019s historic Federal Open Market Committee decision and this week\u2019s data releases perhaps the question on the minds of many is what is the future of US monetary policy? It is important to keep in mind that as one swallow does not a summer make, one rate hike does not a normalized monetary policy make. Even with the December rise interest rates in the US remain low and although the committee has restated its intention to maintain an accommodative monetary policy, it is reasonable to expect further hikes in 2016 \u2013 an expectation further strengthened by today\u2019s strong labour market data.</p> <p>However, this is not to say that sources of risk which could slow down the recovery do not exist, both domestically and globally. Today\u2019s labour-market release shows a participation rate of 62.6% - well below pre-crisis levels. On the global front, equity markets turmoil and the slowdown in China are among the greatest concerns.</p> <p>The exact pace and extent of further interest rate hikes is difficult to predict given that the FOMC itself maintains that it is data-dependent and that it will continue to make interest rate decisions based on a series of indicators that it is monitoring rather than on a pre-set schedule.<br></p> <p>Keeping in mind that the US economy is expected to perform strongly in 2016, but also that December minutes show that the FOMC wants to observe the potentially delayed impact of the rate rise before making further hikes, Cebr expects interest rates to rise to 0.75% in the third quarter of 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fcb71e4b0d22ca1a4bdb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:48:50.060Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s someone who thinks the Federal Reserve could raise US interest rates at its March meeting despite the uninspiring wage data</strong>. Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Average hourly earnings were only flat between November and December. But thanks to a positive basis effect, the year on year rate ticked up to 2.5% from 2.3%. But while the Fed has said at a number of recent occasions that it puts more emphasis on the actual development of inflation rates when determining the appropriate path for short-term interest rates, we think that the unambiguous display of strength in the labor market will continue to bolster the confidence of FOMC members that (a) consumer spending will continue to power the US economy ahead \u2013 despite global headwinds, and (b) that faster wage gains will eventually lift domestic inflation rates. Accordingly, we continue to expect three rate hikes for 2016, with the next one coming at the March meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the jobs numbers themselves he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be sure, the labor market in the fourth quarter of 2015 most likely benefited from two special factors. First, there was a technical rebound in October, after the August and September numbers disappointed (in part due to seasonal adjustment issues). And in November and December, the unusually mild winter weather clearly supported employment in weather-sensitive areas, notably construction. </p> <p>There is, however, in our view no reason at all to question the underlying message of today\u2019s and the previous couple of employment reports: The US labor market continues to be red-hot despite daily reports of global economic headwinds and financial market turmoil. The reason for this resilience \u2013 as highlighted at several occasions \u2013 is that most of the value added and of the job creation in the US occurs in the services sector, which is barely affected by global developments. And this trend strengthened further in 2015. After in 2014 81% of jobs were created in services, this number rose to a whopping 94% in 2015; with another 10% coming from the construction sector! That leaves a very small share of the labor market exposed to the adverse impacts of global economic headwinds and low oil prices.</p> </blockquote> <p><a><br></a><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc8cee4b0d22ca1a4bc94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:33:55.383Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconComms/statuses/685469021802754052\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Commodities?src=hash\">#Commodities</a> (even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gold?src=hash\">#gold</a>) unfazed by strong US jobs report: big <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFP?src=hash\">#NFP</a> gains suggest growth fears overdone, but wage data won&#39;t yet worry Fed.</p>&mdash; Capital Economics (@CapEconComms) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconComms/status/685469021802754052\">January 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc80ce4b0a0fd811ab3e7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:33:26.731Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As expected after the better than expected US jobs figures, Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 110 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.7%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc6c2e4b0d22ca1a4bb9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:25:24.886Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our story on the US non-farm payrolls:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/us-jobs-report-december-2015-economy-jobs\">US jobs report: economy adds 292,000 positions in strong finish to 2015</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc645e4b0600201f48961\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:24:01.316Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More detail on the US jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad864c704d8e6ad72788ae6d2982e0a6fbc70031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad864c704d8e6ad72788ae6d2982e0a6fbc70031/0_0_742_825/450.jpg\" alt=\"Job changes by sector\" width=\"450\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Job changes by sector</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the mining sector, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employment in mining continued to decline in December (-8,000).

There was also no change in the average workweek, which tends to support the notion that wage pressures remain subdued, as increased hours frequently indicate a tight labour market and building wage pressures.</p> <p>Consequently, and even with the strong headline payrolls figure, we don\u2019t think these figures support a March rate hike, talk of which had been building over the past week following strong non-manufacturing ISM and ADP data.

The advanced economies faced similar challenges at corresponding stages in their development. But, in coping with the consequences of financial turbulence, the advanced economies often suffered significant losses of output relative to potential. The Beijing authorities are professedly seeking to change China\u2019s economic growth model from one which depends on exports and capital investment to one more firmly based on domestic consumption. But they may be over-estimating the extent to which politicians can choose how their economies grow. Since curbing growth in some sectors is usually easier than boosting it in others, the danger is that the attempt to re-orient the economy will result in overall weaker growth This is one reason, which seems to be widely acknowledged, why China\u2019s future growth could well fall short not only of recent rates but even of the Beijing authorities\u2019 more conservative projections for the years to come.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then there are the demographic problems, which prompted the abolition of the \u201cOne child per family\u201d rule:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>By 2050, those aged 65 or over could well stand at 38% of the labour force, slightly less favourable even than Japan\u2019s present ratio. There could be ameliorating circumstances for China. There may be scope for more migration from the countryside to urban centres without loss of agricultural production, though much less than there used to be. There will very likely be support to China\u2019s GDP growth from a shift in the urban workforce from low-productivity activities to higher-productivity occupations. Further, China would perhaps be less opposed on cultural grounds than Japan to immigrant labour, though there have been no moves in that direction yet. Indeed, the ruling Communist Party\u2019s highly developed sense of self-preservation might be expected to resist any disturbance of the status quo. At the same time, in the nearer term, China faces a unique problem, the result of the recent abandonment of the one-child policy in favour of a two-child policy. To the extent that this measure is effective in raising the birth rate, it will temporarily boost the dependency ratio, that is, the proportion that the non-working population, old and young, bears to those of working age. Those who are working will need to increase their output merely to meet the needs of a growing non-active population. There will likely be a reduced margin of savings to finance capital investment and thereby to support future growth.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25487dc61504e9542d3be231ab3c4fbf9e895357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25487dc61504e9542d3be231ab3c4fbf9e895357/0_0_2442_1616/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(FILES) This file handout picture taken and released by the Japan Coast Guard on December 22, 2015 shows a Chinese Coast Guard ship near disputed islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and Diaoyu islands in China, in the East China Sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo released by the Japan Coast Guard on December 22, 2015 shows a Chinese Coast Guard ship near disputed islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and Diaoyu islands in China, in the East China Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Japan Coast Guard/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there\u2019s the geopolitics,...</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The region is also a potential war-zone in a way that neither North America nor even Europe appears to be at the moment. Reports this week that North Korea has tested a hydrogen bomb is a reminder of the severity of the threat. Beyond the North Korean danger, both the East China Sea and the South China Sea are possible flashpoints. In the former area, there was a stand-off between Japan and China over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) islands through most of last year. But on 20 December an armed Chinese coast-guard vessel entered territorial waters that Japan claims around the islands. In response to these and other regional tensions, the Japanese government has proposed for the fiscal 2016/17 year a 1.5% increase in military spending to a highest-ever level. This is significant in view of the pressure to achieve reductions in other spending programmes. The Japanese government had been allowed, under the nation\u2019s post-war constitution, the right of self-defence, which would have covered operations around the Senkaku islands, but Mr Abe nevertheless pressed for, and in September secured, an amendment that would allow Japan to afford military help to allies. This strongly suggests that the Abe government foresees the possibility of Japan taking part in the resistance to what several nations in the region regard as Beijing\u2019s aggressive strategy in the South China Sea.</p> <p>It seems a long time since the Spratly islands first hit the headlines. It was as long ago as 1999 that a Filipino naval ship deliberately ran aground on one of those islands to establish a claim to the archipelago. Last year, in a dramatic development, it became clear that China was determinedly seeking to enforce its own title to the area when it built an artificial island on the foundation of the Mischief Reef and went on to claim, in contravention of UN rules, territorial waters around that construction. The US Navy has since sought to enforce freedom of the seas by disregarding China\u2019s pretensions, thereby precipitating low-level exchanges with China\u2019s ships.</p> <p>Vietnam also believes it has interests to defend in the South China Sea. In an ominous development, its government announced on 23 December that it would be taking delivery from Russia of two more Kilo-class submarines to supplement the four it already deploys. These vessels are reckoned to be especially effective in relatively shallow waters (the Iranian navy has three of them). Vietnam\u2019s army has put troop concentrations in the northern province on the border with China under \u2018high combat readiness\u2019. This appears to be a defensive move. But investors should note that Vietnam\u2019s defence doctrine is not based on attacking China\u2019s naval forces head-on, a contest that Vietnam could hardly expect to win. Rather, in the event of hostilities, the aim of the strategists in Hanoi would be to use the submarines to prey on merchant shipping heading to and from Chinese ports through the South China Sea. Their calculation is that the resulting prohibitive cost of freight insurance, or indeed the unwillingness of insurers to provide cover at all, would cripple China\u2019s trade and economic activity. It could also topple China\u2019s financial system, an objective looking less fanciful in the light of this week\u2019s evidence of fragility.

6.5929 backed by state-owned banks\u2019 intervention:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The onshore yuan recovered to 6.5887 in morning trade, while the offshore yuan was about 1.4 percent weaker at 6.6798, narrowing a spread that reached around 2 percent a day earlier, making the central bank\u2019s currency management task more complicated. <br></p> <p>After its sharply lower fix on Thursday, <strong>the PBOC had later sown confusion by reportedly intervening heavily to defend the yuan in offshore trade</strong>, reversing a decline of more than 1 percent that took it to a record low of 6.7600 per dollar. </p> <p>That left dealers at a loss to know what the central bank\u2019s aims were. </p> <p>\u201cThe sharp drop has led to speculation that China is letting go of the reins on the CNY (yuan), or perhaps targeting faster depreciation to reach an \u2018equilibrium\u2019 level,\u201d wrote analysts at Barclays, while conceding that no one was really sure. </p> </blockquote>

      "bodyText": "Observers of the UK yacht industry might be forgiven for some confusion over whether it is riding the crest of a wave or holed below the waterline. At the London Boat Show Britain\u2019s top boat manufacturers are showing off bigger, better and bolder yachts than ever before. Figures scheduled to be released on Monday are expected to show modest growth in the UK marine industry, a sector that has been pulling in revenues of close to \u00a33bn in recent years. On the other hand, guests say the event is smaller than in previous years and it is no secret that British boat-builders have not been shipshape of late. Northamptonshire-based Fairline collapsed into administration shortly before Christmas, while Princess Yachts recently announced plans to axe 350 jobs after a \u201cgruelling\u201d 2014 in which it lost \u00a311.3m. Sunseeker may be launching its shiny \u00a316m, 131ft model here ( \u201can apex in comfort and lavishness\u201d), but the company\u2019s most recent accounts show it sank to a loss of \u00a341m. But if yacht-makers are suffering hard times, they are doing their best to put on a brave face. Everywhere you look at the London Boat Show, sleek and gleaming models are on display. As per international motor shows, most of them stand precariously on sky-high heels in front of the actual boats, smiling winningly at moneyed guests. A bronzed and grinning Hugh Bonneville, star of Downton Abbey, is on hand to open the Sunseeker stand. In the shadow of a three-deck superyacht, an a capella band called The Overtones entertains the crowd, albeit with a disappointing lack of nautical-themed songs. It isn\u2019t all glitz and glamour though. Down at the far end of the room, a long-suffering sales assistant is standing in a puddle to demonstrate the efficacy of some waterproof socks. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for an hour-and-a-half,\u201d she says wearily. A little further along the row of stands, anyone who doesn\u2019t have a small fortune to spend on a yacht can console themselves with a fish-shaped cushion for a mere \u00a315.99. For the big boat-builders though, this show is an opportunity to dip their fingers into the wallets of the Ultra High Net Worth Individuals \u2013 as they\u2019re referred to in the luxury business. The managing director of Princess Yachts, Chris Gates, expects the London and Southampton boat shows to yield contracts that could be worth \u00a320m or more. The Plymouth-based company, owned by the private equity division of global luxury powerhouse LVMH, needs to continue racking up sales if it is to mount a recovery. 2014 was such a tough year partly because of storms that lashed the south-west, damaging boats and equipment. The raging seas also delayed the test voyages that are necessary before a high-spec yacht can be sold and delivered. Princess is still in talks with its insurers over how much of the damage it can claim for, but its losses seem destined to stretch into this year. On top of that, Princess and its rivals are sailing into the headwind of a strong pound and faltering global growth, both of which are eroding international sales. But Gates says it isn\u2019t financial woes that led the company to lay off 350 staff in Plymouth, his home town. Instead, he says, it is because Princess has just finished a development phase in which it designed and built several new boats. Fewer staff are needed now that those models are finished and ready for sale. \u201cWe can\u2019t carry people that we don\u2019t have productive work for,\u201d he says. Local Conservative MP Oliver Colvile has spoken out against the job cuts, pointing out that Princess received \u00a34.6m in government grants in 2013 to build a new boat it said would safeguard jobs. The politician, says Gates, \u201chas got his facts a little confused\u201d and he can expect a full explanation of the role that Princess plays in the depressed local economy upon his return to the city. Now, the company is in recovery mode and Gates believes 2016 will be the year when that will bear fruit. The task at rival Sunseeker is even bigger. After announcing \u00a341m of losses last year the group \u2013 owned by Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda \u2013 recruited Phil Popham from Jaguar Land Rover as its new chief executive. Under Popham, the business is actually recruiting. It wants 225 new staff - to cope with an anticipated 20% rise in Ultra High Net Worth Individuals by 2020 \u2013 and has predicted it will swing back into profit this year. But seated on the middle deck of the three-deck Sunseeker 131, Popham talks mainly of cost-cutting, streamlining and improving efficiency, the mundane realities one usually hears from the bosses of High Street businesses. The austerity narrative seems entirely at odds with the ostentatious interior of this astonishing vessel, a snip at \u00a316m excluding VAT. The ship, named Zozo, boasts multiple bedrooms with flat-screen TVs, a kitchen that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a Kensington townhouse, shelving units with backlit onyx panels and a \u00a330,000 chandelier. But the reality experienced by Zozo\u2019s new owner is not that of the boat-building industry. While one can cruise the high seas in comfort and style without a care in the world, the other is facing a long, arduous voyage out of the doldrums.",

Any float could take place after that.</p> <p>The Saudis have recently introduced a raft of changes to the economy, not least has been a decision to cut subsidies on domestic energy bills and a plan to introduce VAT taxes. Both are considered risky in a conservative country with such fragile democratic credentials.</p> <p>Jason Tuvey, a Middle East specialist at Capital Economics, said it was difficult to value Saudi Aramco and he had come across speculative figures ranging from $1tn to $10tn.</p> <p>Even the lower figure means Aramco is worth three times as much as Exxon Mobil, and a 5% stake of that would easily dwarf the $25bn raised by China\u2019s Alibaba group, whose $25bn float is the largest so far.</p> <p>Fadel Gheit, a veteran oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co brokerage in New York, questioned how easy it would be for the Saudis to pull off a significant flotation given Aramco was used to a very low level of transparency.</p> <p>And he pointed out that Prince Mohammed had raised another issue at Aramco that could concern any potential buyers: corruption.</p> <p>\u201cIf western investors are to be interested in Aramco they are going to want all sorts of details and reassurances about the way the company will be run, its growth prospects and dividend policies.

      "bodyText": "Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, is studying plans to privatise some of its subsidiaries as well as offering shares in the main business. The news follows comments made by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday that he supported the trillion-dollar company being prepared for an initial public offering (IPO). If the float goes ahead it will be the world\u2019s most valuable quoted company, dwarfing Apple, Exxon and Google. The moves have astonished the oil sector and led to speculation about whether a share float would change the Saudi strategy of driving down oil prices by refusing to cut back on production. Analysts believe the world\u2019s most valuable business will attract a lot of interest from potential investors, but warn that the Saudis could underestimate western concerns about Aramco\u2019s traditional secrecy and the impact of falling oil prices. A statement from the oil group said: \u201cSaudi Aramco confirms that it has been studying various options to allow broad public participation in its equity through the listing in the capital markets of an appropriate percentage of the company\u2019s shares and/or the listing of a bundle its downstream subsidiaries. \u201cThis proposal is consistent with the broad and progressive direction pursued by the Kingdom for reforms, including privatization in various sectors of the Saudi economy and deregulation of markets.\u2019\u2019 Prince Mohammed expected a review of the business, which has reserves of 260bn barrels and 60,000 staff, to be completed within months. Any float could take place after that. The Saudis have recently introduced a raft of changes to the economy, not least has been a decision to cut subsidies on domestic energy bills and a plan to introduce VAT taxes. Both are considered risky in a conservative country with such fragile democratic credentials. Jason Tuvey, a Middle East specialist at Capital Economics, said it was difficult to value Saudi Aramco and he had come across speculative figures ranging from $1tn to $10tn. Even the lower figure means Aramco is worth three times as much as Exxon Mobil, and a 5% stake of that would easily dwarf the $25bn raised by China\u2019s Alibaba group, whose $25bn float is the largest so far. Fadel Gheit, a veteran oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co brokerage in New York, questioned how easy it would be for the Saudis to pull off a significant flotation given Aramco was used to a very low level of transparency. And he pointed out that Prince Mohammed had raised another issue at Aramco that could concern any potential buyers: corruption. \u201cIf western investors are to be interested in Aramco they are going to want all sorts of details and reassurances about the way the company will be run, its growth prospects and dividend policies. Will the Saudi government be willing to provide these and relinquish control? \u201cThe company may have huge oil reserves but look at what happened when Petrobras (the Brazilian state oil group) was privatised. There was a total lack of understanding of free markets and the stock dived in value.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy added 292,000 jobs in December, exceeding expectations, while the unemployment rate remained steady at 5%, the US Department of Labor announced on Friday. This was the last jobs report for 2015. Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected a strong finish for the year, with about 200,000 jobs added in December. The unemployment rate of 5% was at a seven-and-a-half-year low for a third straight month. The better-than-expected job gains in December were due to the warm weather, according to Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cWe suspect the rise in payrolls in December was helped by milder-than-usual weather around the time of the sample week,\u201d said O\u2019Sullivan. He pointed out that the number of non-farm workers with a job who did not work because of bad weather went up by just 28,000 this December, which is \u201cbelow the 114,000 median rise in the past 10 December reports\u201d. Not only did the job creation in December surpass expectations, but the jobs figures from the previous two months were revised up significantly. November figures were revised from 211,000 to 252,000 and October\u2019s from 298,000 to 307,000. Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 284,000 a month. The US economy added 2.65m jobs in 2015. Additionally, the number of Americans working part-time but wanting full-time jobs went down by 764,000 in 2015, to six million. \u201cOne considerable disappointment in this survey, and perhaps a more important one as far as the pace of future [federal interest rate] hikes is concerned, is the wages figures,\u201d said Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank. \u201cConsensus had been looking for a modest 0.2% month-on-month increase, which would have taken wages into a range they had not inhabited since before the financial crisis. Instead, wages still seem to be struggling to rise.\u201d Wages remained little changed in December. The US Department of Labor has in the past referred to wages as \u201cthe unfinished business of this recovery\u201d. Overall, in 2015, average hourly earnings increased by 2.5%. In order for low-income Americans to feel the impact of the US economic recovery, wage growth would have to reach 3% to 4% a year. Earlier this week, figures from payroll company ADP showed that US private sector companies added 257,000 jobs in December. This was the largest gain since December 2014. Furthermore, layoffs in December were the smallest in over 15 years. The creation of more than 292,000 jobs in December was \u201can indication of a relatively strong labor market in 2015, especially compared with the Great Recession and the beginning of the recovery\u201d, said Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. She added that the US economy still had a \u201cway to go before we reach full employment\u201d. The Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, expects the US labor market to continue to improve in the coming year. She predicts that the US will reach reach full employment in 2016 or 2017. Last month, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time since June 2006 and is expected to raise them again this year. The Fed meets eight times a year. Its first meeting of 2016 is on 26-27 January. According to Carnell, the Fed will not raise interest rates again in March as some economists have suggested. It is more likely that the next hike will come in June, he predicted. When making the decision to raise interest rates, the Fed is likely to look at the overall state of the US economy. And while the US labor market may have had a strong finish to the year, Friday\u2019s job report came after a brutal week in the US stock market. Due to the slowdown in China\u2019s economy and trouble in the Middle East, US stock market started the New Year with the worst performance since 2008. By Thursday evening, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 392.41 points, or 2.32%, capping its worst four-day start to a year in more than a century.",

      "bodyText": "Few of Sports Direct\u2019s external shareholders have ever been impressed by its corporate governance but most have consoled themselves with a look at the share price, which went up in spectacular style for more than half a decade. You could have bought a slice in Mike Ashley\u2019s creation at 50p in November 2008 and sold at 900p in April 2014. But now? Friday\u2019s profits warning \u2013 issued less than a month after half-year profits missed City forecasts \u2013 has taken the share price below 450p for the first time since mid-2013. That\u2019s not a surprise because the statement, blaming slower sales on unseasonal weather and a deterioration of trading conditions in the high street, raises more questions than it answers. Should a mild winter really upset trading at a sportswear chain? Sports Direct is not in the coats and jumpers business in the way that Marks &amp; Spencer and Next are. Warm temperatures, in theory, might even encourage better sales of trainers and tracksuits than freezing conditions would.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil prices have rebounded and global stock markets recovered after Beijing mustered what analysts called its \u201cnational team\u201d to intervene and boost the yuan. The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose more than 2% and later traded 1.8% higher at $34.36 a barrel. On Thursday, it had hit $32.16, the lowest since April 2004. Chinese stocks recovered by 2% on Friday after the People\u2019s Bank of China strengthened its official rate for the first time in nine trading days. The depreciation of the yuan has spooked investors and fuelled capital flight out of China. Beijing also performed a dramatic U-turn on Thursday by deactivating a stock market circuit-breaker, itself was blamed for aggravating this week\u2019s market falls. At the start of the day, trading was halted after less than 30 minutes when stocks plunged by more than 7% \u2013 the second time the circuit-breaker was triggered since its introduction this week. The move sent global stocks tumbling. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cChina\u2019s removal of counter-productive circuit breakers, state buying and a rise in the yuan helped prevent another stock market rout and alleviated concerns that the central bank would continue the rapid devaluation of the currency.\u201d The recovery in China boosted stocks in Europe and Asia Pacific. The FTSE 100 index in London rose nearly 40 points to 5591.89, a 0.6% gain. Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.9% ahead, France\u2019s CAC has added 0.6% while Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 0.7%. Angus Nicholson, market analyst at IG, said: \u201cThe big thing [is] that we have seen the Chinese government rallying the \u2018national team forces\u2019 in both the currency market and the equities market,\u201d he said, as traders reported China\u2019s state-owned banks intervening to prop up the yuan. After a day of wild trading, the Shanghai Composite Index and the CSI 300, which comprises the biggest stocks from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, both finished about 2% higher, at 3186.78 and 3361.56 respectively. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng added 0.6% to 20,453.71. However, other markets continued to suffer. Japan\u2019s Nikkei and the Australian market both closed 0.4% lower, with Australian shares ending a sixth straight day in the red. Marc Ostwald, market strategist at ADM ISI, said: \u201cChina\u2019s authorities have clearly bitten far more than they can chew in their markets and economy reform efforts, with a clear sense that they are at best fumbling in the dark emerging.\u201d The latest bout of stock market turmoil presents a major challenge to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who has portayed himself as the country\u2019s top economic steward, ahead of the prime minister, Li Keqiang. Xi was reportedly livid over a humiliating stock market debacle in mid-2015, lambasting senior economic officials after he appeared on the front cover of the Economist fighting to prop up Chinese shares. Experts say the credibility of Beijing\u2019s economic policymakers has been further damaged by the latest turmoil. The Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, questioned whether Beijing could afford to keep supporting the yuan in light of its record decline in foreign reserves last month. There were unconfirmed reports on Friday morning that Xiao Gang, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), would resign. Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC business school, said Beijing\u2019s economic flip-flopping and \u201cwild swings in policymaking\u201d had severely damaged confidence. \u201cChinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u2019t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade gap remained alarmingly high in November after exports fell to their lowest value since July. Official figures showed the deficit in goods and services narrowed to \u00a33.2bn compared with \u00a33.5bn in the previous month, but this was only after a drop in oil imports and a \u00a32.4bn fall in the value of \u201cunspecified goods\u201d, mainly gold, brought into the country. The persistently high level of the UK trade deficit leaves George Osborne with a headache and will likely renew calls for further action to boost exports. The chancellor warned on Thursday about a \u201cdangerous cocktail\u201d of economic risks which meant 2016 was likely to be one of the toughest years since the financial crisis. Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cWhile the narrowing of the trade deficit for goods in November is a positive development, there\u2019s little encouragement for UK manufacturers because it was solely driven by lower imports. Disappointingly, exports remained lacklustre. \u201cThe UK\u2019s export performance will be a key indicator to watch in 2016. Exports are set to remain under pressure from weak demand flowing from slower growth in emerging markets, particularly China. Yet stronger economic growth in the US and the eurozone should provide some support.\u201d Exports fell by \u00a3500m, or 1.2%, to \u00a342.2bn. The Office for National Statistics said this decrease comprised a \u00a3200m decline in the export of services and a \u00a3300m drop in the export of goods, specifically finished manufactures. Total imports fell by \u00a3800m to \u00a345.4bn over the same period, largely as a result of a sharp decline of \u00a3500m in the import of fuels, mainly oil, and the drop in unspecified goods. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said the chancellor \u201chas a lot of work to do\u201d to redress the trade deficit. \u201cOsborne used a speech [on Thursday] to warn of the risks to the British economy ahead, and reaffirm his commitment to further austerity measures. It signals that an interest rate rise is some way off. \u201cHowever downbeat the prospects for the British economy in the year ahead, Osborne and co will be thankful that there are many major economies in a worse state. All eyes will now turn to China in the short term to see how big an effect the slowdown and share sell-off has on the UK.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a traumatic first few days of the new year, there is a calmer feeling around stock markets, with a recovery after China\u2019s latest actions, albeit a tentative one. Tesco is the biggest riser of the day so far in the FTSE 100, climbing 8.25p or nearly 6% to 147.45p after a positive note from analysts at Barclays which raised its recommendation, albeit lowering its target price. Analyst James Anstead said: We think recent share price underperformance has left Tesco\u2019s valuation at attractive levels, although we remain conscious of the numerous headwinds facing the UK food retail market. In particular, it now offers a reasonably visible double- digit free cash flow yield and is trading in-line with Sainsbury on an enterprise value/sales basis for the first time in many years. We also think that there are a number of likely helpful catalysts in the coming months \u2013 with additional information at the full year results and in the Annual Report helping earnings visibility and with the potential resolution of several long-running distractions. Additionally, we tend to think that the upcoming trading statement (14 January) may be less worrisome than the market\u2019s worst fears. Consequently we upgrade our stock rating to overweight (from equal weight), and our price target (reduced to \u00a31.90 from \u00a32.25, based on an average of discounted cash flow and sum of the parts valuations) still gives a 34% upside potential. Risks certainly remain . . . The threat of the discounters to the UK supermarket sector remains clear \u2013 although we believe recent market share data provides a little room for encouragement. The potential upwards pressure from the Living Wage remains, although we do not expect a visible impact in the near future. But other factors may turn in Tesco\u2019s favour . . . UK food deflation may start to ease off in 2016, supermarket spending may show more benefit from falling fuel prices and discount rates may help erode Tesco\u2019s pension deficit. There are no guarantees on any of these points but we tend to think the risk profile is tilted in Tesco\u2019s favour. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 39.79 points at 5993.87, helped by signs that the Chinese government was attempting to get to grips with the recent market turmoil. The removal of the controversial circuit breakers defused some of the panic selling and the Shanghia Composite ended 2% higher, while support for the yuan also helped. But the week\u2019s volatility has unnerved investors returning from the festive holiday, and the mood is still cautious ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers due later. The FTSE 100 is still on course for a near 4% decline on the week. That compares with a 4.9% fall for the whole of 2015. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: What should have been a perky start to 2016, with New Year optimism underpinned by portfolio positioning as investors buy stocks, has been eclipsed by ongoing concerns on global growth, the oil price and negative geopolitical developments. The general souring of sentiment had been exacerbated by the Chinese circuit breakers, along with Fed minutes which questioned the strength of belief in the December hike and sellers apparently pushing against an open door. Today\u2019s non-farm payrolls and the imminent fourth quarter reporting season on both sides of the pond could provide some solace, although investors will be scrutinising the latter for real revenue growth as opposed to cost-efficiency driven gains which epitomised much of last year. In the meantime, investors of a more cautious disposition remain on the sidelines. Elsewhere GKN also benefited from a broker note, up 14.3p to 289.1p as Bank of America Merrill Lynch moved from underperform to buy, saying the engineering group was probably through the worst of a decline in aerospace business and should gain ground from increased production by Airbus and Boeing. But property group Intu is down 2.2p at 302.8p as Exane BNP Paribas moved from neutral to underperform. Despite a rise in oil prices, with Brent crude up 1.57% to $34.28 a barrel, there are still concerns about lack of demand as the global economy slows, and oversupply as Iran production could restart in earnest as sanctions are lifted. So Royal Dutch Shell A shares are down 19p at 1435.5p and BP is 2.2p lower at 335.5p.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets in Asia Pacific have experienced a day of wild trading after Beijing allowed its currency to strengthen and mustered \u201cthe national team\u201d of central and state-owned banks to avoid sharp selloffs. Chinese stocks initially jumped by more than 2% after markets opened on Friday morning but then swung back down by as much as 4% before rebounding. By the lunchtime trading break the Shenzhen Composite Index was up 1.65% at 1,990.34 and the Shanghai Composite Index was up 2.39% at 3,199.57.99. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was up 1.22% at 20,580.43, according to the South China Morning Post. Angus Nicholson, a markets analyst from IG, said the rebound appeared to be the result of government intervention to prevent a repeat of Thursday\u2019s turbulence when trading was halted after less than 30 minutes when stocks plunged by more than 7%. \u201cThe big thing [is] that we have seen the Chinese government rallying the \u2018national team forces\u2019 in both the currency market and the equities market,\u201d he said, as traders reported the state-owned banks intervening to prop up the yuan. However, other markets continued to suffer. The Nikkei average in Japan was down 0.46% while the Australian market closed down 0.39% to end a sixth straight day in the red. The latest bout of stock market turmoil presents a major challenge to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who has spun himself as the country\u2019s top economic steward, ahead of the prime minister, Li Keqiang. Xi was reportedly livid over a humiliating stock market debacle in mid-2015, lambasting senior economic officials after he appeared on the front cover of the Economist fighting to prop up Chinese shares. Experts say the credibility of Beijing\u2019s economic policymakers has been further damaged by the latest week of financial turmoil. The Japanese finance minister Taro Aso questioned whether Beijing could afford to keep supporting the yuan in light of its record decline in foreign reserves last month. On Friday morning there were unconfirmed reports that Xiao Gang, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), was set to resign. \u201cChinese authorities\u2019 ability to manage the capital markets and their currency has been greatly dented this week because they put into place what turned out to be very badly thought out new regulations for the capital markets that have only added to volatility,\u201d said Nicholson. \u201cI think the markets are still waiting to see what happens next week and how determined the Chinese government will be in intervening in both the equity and currency markets, to try and manage both of them. Any sort of rebound in global equities \u2013 a major rebound at least \u2013 will probably be delayed until you do see a significant and continued intervention by the Chinese authorities in both the currency and the equity markets.\u201d Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC business school, said Beijing\u2019s economic flip-flopping and \u201cwild swings in policymaking\u201d had severely damaged confidence. \u201cChinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u2019t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing.\u201d The depreciation of China\u2019s currency, the yuan or renminbi, has spooked investors and fuelled capital flight out of China. A dramatic day of global trading on Thursday saw \u00a330bn wiped off the FTSE 100. On Friday morning China\u2019s central bank appeared to respond to investor concerns by fixing its currency higher against the US dollar with a midpoint range of 6.5636 per dollar. However, Nicholson said Beijing was now in a major fix. On one hand it wants to see the yuan weaken in order to boost flagging exports amid signs China\u2019s economy was in far greater trouble than the government has admitted. On the other hand Beijing also desperately wants to avoid the global panic that the currency\u2019s devaluation would spark. \u201cThis is the dilemma they face,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to worry everybody and every time they devalue it causes panic globally. But at the same time they do need to devalue it. So while they can put a pause on it temporarily, inevitably they are going to start weakening it again.\u201d Nicholson added: \u201cAt this current juncture you might think there could be a pause on the renminbi weakening next week or perhaps for a couple of weeks. But at some point down the line they are going to restart it and maybe at the next point when they do it it is a one-off major devaluation. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess when that could occur but certainly in the short term in that event it would be a crisis for equities and global economies. But probably over the longer term might be a far preferable outcome than this steady devaluation and increased panic that we are seeing at the moment.\u201d",
