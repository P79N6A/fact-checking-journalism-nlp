Try this testimony from a driver at Parcelforce, as related in the latest excellent report by Frank Field MP and Andrew Forsey: \u201cI have been fined over \u00a3400 for being too sick to get to work for just one day and once had to pay for a company employee\u2019s overtime to come out on [the] route with me whilst I sat next to him with a bucket in case I was sick.\u201d Field and Forsey\u2019s first report last year prompted the prime minister to appoint Matthew Taylor to review employment practices in the gig economy; the findings and recommendations are due to be published next week. The second, into Uber, encouraged Transport for London to grant the California taxi firm only a short-term licence while it consults on a new regulatory system. This third report \u2013 based largely on evidence from workers at Parcelforce, Dynamic Parcel Force (DPD) and British Car Auctions \u2013 deserves to make a similar splash. It should persuade even die-hard enthusiasts for the gig economy that, too often, the label \u201cself-employed\u201d is a grand pretence. Companies free themselves of the obligation to pay employers\u2019 national insurance, pension contributions, and holiday and sick pay. In return, they can grant their workers virtually no freedoms or benefits. The job can still be performed by workers who are told when, where and how to do the work, on pain of disciplinary action. It is not self-employment as the term is generally understood. There will, of course, be examples of \u201cself-employed\u201d workers who gain from the arrangement in the form of higher earnings \u2013 it would be silly to pretend otherwise. But, as this report shows, the result can be lower wages, job insecurity and workers being forced to bear hidden costs and risks. What should be done? Field and Forsey have two big ideas. The first is to introduce a \u201cnational minimum standard of fair work\u201d in the gig economy. That needs refinement and definition. But the second proposal is pleasingly simple: reverse the legal burden of proof and make companies demonstrate that their workforces are genuinely self-employed. That single measure \u2013 if enforced \u2013 could make a meaningful difference quite quickly. The current law is clearly failing to prevent companies dressing up the same job in different clothes and calling it \u201cself-employment\u201d. Forcing companies to offer a justification upfront would be a common sense response. The Taylor Report, let\u2019s hope, will come to a similar conclusion. If so, one suspects Taylor would be cheered by the majority of companies who accept the normal duties and responsibilities that come with employing people. They, too, are sick of being undercut by rivals who twist the definition of \u201cself-employment\u201d to make it mean something that was never intended. Burberry\u2019s top discounts Here\u2019s another grumble for Burberry\u2019s revolting shareholders to air at next week\u2019s annual meeting: how on Earth does the fashion house justify discounts of 80% for senior management when they buy the company\u2019s fashions? A modest discount, say 20%, would be par for the course. But 80%? That\u2019s almost giving the stuff away. The incoming chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, will be the next recipient of this generosity. Given how much Gobbetti is being paid \u2013 up to \u00a37.3m-a-year, including an \u00a380,000 allowance for clothing, a car and travel \u2013 you\u2019d hope he\u2019d be loyal to the brand naturally when he needs a new mac. Even the non-executive directors are entitled to the 80% discount because they are deemed to be \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d. The title seems to be easier to gain than lose. Former finance director Carol Fairweather left in January but will enjoy her discount until the end of March next year, says the remuneration report, \u201cor later, if the committee so determines\u201d. The perk for the bosses (other staff get smaller discounts, obviously) won\u2019t put a serious dent in profits, of course. And next week\u2019s expected rows over pay will cover conventional territory, such as share awards. But it all adds to the impression that the sense of entitlement among Burberry\u2019s well-dressed directors runs deep.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has been urged to stage an \u201cemergency intervention\u201d to protect gig economy workers, amid concerns they are being forced into contracts that sometimes pay less than \u00a32.50 an hour and can be cancelled at any moment. The allegations are detailed in the latest report by the former work and pensions committee chair, Frank Field MP, into the gig economy, where people work flexible hours on short-term or freelance contracts without the rights of permanent employees. Field\u2019s report comes nine months after Theresa May promised in her maiden party conference speech as prime minister to \u201cmake sure that, in our modern and flexible economy, people are properly protected at work\u201d. Its findings are likely to intensify scrutiny of a government-backed review by former Tony Blair adviser Matthew Taylor into modern employment practices, which is expected to be published early next week. Field\u2019s report focuses on firms including Parcelforce, DPD, and \u2013 for the first time \u2013 British Car Auctions, owner of webuyanycar.com. Complaints raised by staff interviewed for the report include being fined hundreds of pounds unless they worked while ill, while others said that self-employment meant they ended up earning as little as \u00a32.22 an hour, or even losing money. Field also claimed that Parcelforce, owned by Royal Mail, \u201ctied each driver\u2019s hands behind their back\u201d by requiring them to sign a contract forbidding them from challenging their employment status. He said the clause \u2013 which echoes a similar passage dropped by Deliveroo after a backlash from couriers \u2013 was \u201csymptomatic of the threatening and hostile environment in which some people are required to work\u201d. He added that such contracts were \u201ctoo often characterised by poverty wages, chronic insecurity and appalling treatment\u201d, with terms designed to subsidise company profits. The report cites testimony from some of Parcelforce\u2019s 3,000 couriers, about a quarter of whom are self-employed owner-drivers who are paid per delivery and must fund their own vehicle, fuel, insurance and uniform. Many of the owner-drivers, it says, were persuaded to give up their status as full employees \u2013 which granted them superior workers\u2019 rights \u2013 on the promise of better pay and more flexibility. Two Parcelforce drivers told Field \u201cwe are frequently warned we could lose our jobs if we don\u2019t do as we\u2019re told\u201d, while a DPD driver said \u201cconditions of employment are precarious, to say the least\u201d. The report said drivers were \u201ccoming to work with broken bones\u201d to avoid fines of up to \u00a3400 a day for failing to work their shifts. One Parcelforce courier said he paid for a colleague to join him on deliveries \u201cwhilst I sat next to him with a bucket in case I was sick\u201d. Royal Mail, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2013 and is no longer government-owned, made a profit of \u00a3742m last year. Parcelforce said: \u201cWe strongly believe that our owner-drivers are treated fairly.\u201d It said owner-drivers could expected \u201csignificant returns\u201d of an average \u00a339,400 after running costs. \u201cMany of our self-employed owner-drivers are substantial businesses in their own right. For this reason, Parcelforce Worldwide sets out the contractual terms clearly for both the benefit of the company and the owner-drivers. Self-employed owner-drivers do not therefore receive the benefits of employment such as sick pay, pension and holiday pay.\u201d A Royal Mail spokesman said: \u201cAs a responsible business, we treat all of our business partners with fairness and respect. At Parcelforce Worldwide, 75 per cent of our drivers are employees. They have amongst the best terms and conditions in our industry. \u201cThe parcels market is highly competitive. It is becoming ever more so. In the early 2000s, Parcelforce Worldwide had to adapt its business model to remain in business and employees were offered enhanced voluntary redundancy terms. At that time, with the agreement of our union, we also introduced self-employed owner-driver contracts. Employees who took enhanced voluntary redundancy were able to tender for these if they wished.\u201d Couriers for DPD said the requirement to cover the cost of a replacement driver when they are ill meant they could end up losing money. One said a colleague earned \u00a32,100 in four weeks, but ended up being charged \u00a32,800 due to costs such as petrol and insurance, as well as \u201cfines because he was too poorly to drive the van\u201d. Another driver for DPD, which made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3125m last year, said: \u201cThey are quick to brag about how much profit the company makes, but this is at the expense of not treating its drivers properly.\u201d One driver for British Car Auctions claimed the terms of his self-employment contract meant he often ended up being paid a fraction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 for over-25s. \u201cI, along with all other self-employed drivers, have been paid as little as \u00a32.22 per hour. BCA will argue that we are self-employed and paid per car, but does that give them the right to pay third-world wages?\u201d Field added: \u201cThe poverty pay and shoddy treatment meted out to some of those workers is, sadly, inevitable in the absence of statutory minimum standards in the gig economy. That generates huge profits while minimising tax payments.\u201d DPD and BCA did not return requests for comment. Field said the evidence gathered for the report showed that companies should be forced to prove staff are self-employed \u2013 reversing existing labour laws, where the onus is on staff to prove their status. \u201cWe believe such moves are necessary to bring to an end the current free-for-all whereby an unknown number of workers on low incomes are, in effect, subsidising the companies with whom they work,\u201d the report says. He also called for a more immediate \u201cemergency intervention\u201d to guarantee labour rights, particularly a minimum income. Several high-profile cases involving firms such as Uber and CitySprint have seen staff argue that they should be classed as workers, an official classification that carries additional rights to independent contractors, including a minimum wage and holiday pay. What the drivers say... ...on \u2018threats\u2019 and insecurity \u201cConditions of employment are precarious to say the least. The communication received from DPD always has a threatening edge to it as they know people worry about their jobs.\u201d \u2013 DPD driver \u201cI have been fined over \u00a3400 for being too sick to get to work for just one day and once I had to pay for a company employee\u2019s overtime to come out on route with me whilst I sat next to him with a bucket in case I was sick.\u201d \u2013 Parcelforce driver ...on \u2018poverty pay\u2019 \u201cI, along with all other self-employed drivers, have been paid as little as \u00a32.22 per hour. \u00a33/\u00a34/\u00a35 per hour is not unusual and is probably the norm. BCA will argue that we are self-employed and paid per car, but does that give them the right to pay third-world wages?\u201d \u2013 British Car Auctions driver \u201cWhile profits soar, we as drivers get exploited, underpaid and taken for granted.\u201d \u2013 DPD driver ...on flexibility \u201cI cannot see if you are told how, when and what to do you can be truly self-employed. If [you] say \u2018no\u2019 to them you are threatened with contract cancellation and if you question them then you are told that you can always leave as someone else can take [your] place.\u201d \u2013 Parcelforce driver \u201cIf you work at the same depot every day, wear a DPD uniform, drive a DPD van, get given a DPD scanner, are told by DPD management what parcels to deliver at what rate, don\u2019t work for anyone else, you legally should be protected by the government as being employed.\u201d \u2013 DPD driver ...on the impact on workers\u2019 lives \u201cIf I fail to turn up to work I can get fined up to \u00a3400 a day. I recently had to go into work after sitting up all night with my mother until she died \u2013 and then do a 12-hour day.\u201d \u2013 Parcelforce driver \u201cThis isn\u2019t self-employment, or employment either. It\u2019s a living hell, a nightmare scenario and the government needs to bring in legislation to stop these crooks from ripping off vulnerable people.\u201d \u2013 DPD driver.",

One Parcelforce courier said he paid for a colleague to join him on deliveries \u201cwhilst I sat next to him with a bucket in case I was sick\u201d.</p> <p>Royal Mail, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/10/royal-mail-flotation-privatisation\">floated on the London Stock Exchange</a> in 2013 and is no longer government-owned, made a profit of \u00a3742m last year.</p> <p>Parcelforce said: \u201cWe strongly believe that our owner-drivers are treated fairly.\u201d</p> <p>It said owner-drivers could expected \u201csignificant returns\u201d of an average \u00a339,400 after running costs.</p> <p>\u201cMany of our self-employed owner-drivers are substantial businesses in their own right. For this reason, Parcelforce Worldwide sets out the contractual terms clearly for both the benefit of the company and the owner-drivers. Self-employed owner-drivers do not therefore receive the benefits of employment such as sick pay, pension and holiday pay.\u201d</p> <p>A Royal Mail spokesman said: \u201cAs a responsible business, we treat all of our business partners with fairness and respect. At Parcelforce Worldwide, 75 per cent of our drivers are employees. They have amongst the best terms and conditions in our industry. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe parcels market is highly competitive. It is becoming ever more so. In the early 2000s, Parcelforce Worldwide had to adapt its business model to remain in business and employees were offered enhanced voluntary redundancy terms. At that time, with the agreement of our union, we also introduced self-employed owner-driver contracts. Employees who took enhanced voluntary redundancy were able to tender for these if they wished.\u201d </p> <p>Couriers for DPD said the requirement to cover the cost of a replacement driver when they are ill meant they could end up losing money.</p> <p>One said a colleague earned \u00a32,100 in four weeks, but ended up being charged \u00a32,800 due to costs such as petrol and insurance, as well as \u201cfines because he was too poorly to drive the van\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"590237e61f62a91c4badd42e885b2d930fd64737\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/590237e61f62a91c4badd42e885b2d930fd64737/0_335_5142_3087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DPD delivery driver\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Couriers for DPD said the requirement to cover the cost of a replacement driver when they are ill meant they could lose money.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another driver for DPD, which made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3125m last year, said: \u201cThey are quick to brag about how much profit the company makes, but this is at the expense of not treating its drivers properly.\u201d</p> <p>One driver for British Car Auctions claimed the terms of his self-employment contract meant he often ended up being paid a fraction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 for over-25s.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI, along with all other self-employed drivers, have been paid as little as \u00a32.22 per hour.</p> <p> BCA will argue that we are self-employed and paid per car, but does that give them the right to pay third-world wages?\u201d</p> <p>Field added: \u201cThe poverty pay and shoddy treatment meted out to some of those workers is, sadly, inevitable in the absence of statutory minimum standards in the gig economy.

Last year investors were worried the stock market darling was running out of steam after sales at UK stores open more than one year turned negative for the first time. But John Bason, finance director at Primark\u2019s parent company, AB Foods, said the fashion chain had returned to form over the past three months. He said the retailer\u2019s success was helped by the recent good weather and its \u201cvalue\u201d fashion appealing to increasingly hard-up Britons as inflation bites. \u201cTrading in the third quarter was very strong indeed,\u201d said Bason, although he pointed out that the numbers were flattered by poor figures from a year ago when \u201cunpredictable weather patterns\u201d dented sales. \u201cWe had easy comparatives \u2026 but I don\u2019t think our stores or merchandise have ever looked better.\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Charlie Mills estimated that like-for-like sales in the UK had risen 6% in the third quarter. \u201cPrimark looks to have had a stellar third quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is partly due to a soft comparative, but also very strong footfall and transactions leading to record market share gains.\u201d Bason said in recent months the number of shoppers visiting its stores had increased and that when they got to the till they were buying more items. That is in sharp contrast with larger rivals Next and Marks &amp; Spencer, which are battling falling clothing sales as Britons spend less cash on wardrobe updates and when they do look to trade down to cheaper stores. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the best clothing prices on the high street and are selling it at full price because we have got what people want,\u201d said Bason. The industry data showed the return of inflation was having an impact on disposable incomes, he said, adding: \u201cI think we are seeing the start of some tougher times for UK consumers.\u201d Shoppers, however, were keen on Primark\u2019s inexpensive take on catwalk trends, with the retailer reporting strong sales of embroidered tops and ripped jeans. There was also huge demand for novelty items such as inflatable flamingos and unicorns as Britons basked in paddling pools or packed them to take on holiday. Primark, Britain\u2019s third largest clothing retailer by sales value behind M&amp;S and Next, gained market share in the 40 weeks to 24 June. Total UK sales rose 9% thanks to a store opening spree that included Llandudno and Uxbridge. Primark said group sales were up 15% at constant currencies in the third quarter. The retailer has successfully established a chain in Spain and has launched a global push, opening shops in Staten Island and New York in the US as well as Florence in Italy. The retailer had previously warned investors that its profit margins would face greater pressure in the second half of the year, but Bason said they would now be no lower than in the first half after it struck improved deals with its suppliers. Primark shares closed up more than 2% on Thursday, making it the second biggest riser in the FTSE 100.",

    "webTitle": "Hinkley Point C: UK censured for failing to consult German public", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK has been censured by an international committee for its failure to notify the German public of the potential environmental impacts of Hinkley Point C, the new nuclear power station being built in Somerset, south-west England. In a political embarrassment for the government, the verdict found that the UK had not complied with the Aarhus convention, an international agreement on involving citizens in environmental matters. The Aarhus committee\u2019s finding followed a complaint by a German Green party politician, who said the UK should now halt work on the project to properly consult with the public in neighbouring countries. Sylvia Kotting-Uhl told the Guardian: \u201cIf the government does not want to ridicule the trans-boundary participation procedure that is now due, construction works should be suspended until the procedure is completed.\u201d While the ruling is very unlikely to affect the project, which began construction last year, the breach comes on top of a fortnight of bad news for the two atomic reactors. EDF, the French state-owned developer of Hinkley Point C, admitted this week that costs were likely to rise by \u00a31.5bn and there was a risk of a 15-month delay, just days after the public spending watchdog called the project \u201crisky and expensive\u201d. Kotting-Uhl originally complained to Aarhus\u2019s compliance committee in the summer of 2013, before the UK had agreed commercial terms with EDF. She said the UK government had discriminated against Germans by not giving them opportunities to take part in the environmental impact assessment procedure for Hinkley, as the Aarhus convention requires. The committee agreed. In conclusions published recently, the committee said: \u201cBy not ensuring that the public concerned in Germany had a reasonable chance to learn about the proposed activity and the opportunities for the public to participate in the respective decision-making, the party concerned failed to comply with article 6, paragraph 2, of the convention.\u201d Named after the Danish city of A\u030arhus, the convention covers the involvement of the public on environmental matters relating to developments such as power stations or new roads \u2013 including access to information, the public\u2019s participation in decision-making, and access to justice. The UK ratified the agreement in 2005. The former UN secretary general Kofi Annan called it \u201cthe most ambitious venture in the area of environmental democracy so far undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations\u201d. The Aarhus committee said that ministers should put in place a legal framework to ensure that the failure to inform the public about Hinkley\u2019s potential risks is not repeated. In the case of nuclear power stations, it said: \u201cPublic authorities are required to consider the magnitude of the effects if an accident would indeed occur, even if the risk of an accident is very small.\u201d The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThe government has cooperated fully with the Aarhus compliance committee investigation and there was extensive public consultation on proposals for Hinkley Point C before development consent was granted.\u201d The spokeswoman added that the government was confident Hinkley would have \u201cno significant adverse effect on the environment of any other country\u201d. The issue of notification around Hinkley is due to be discussed at a meeting in September of the 46 countries signed up to the convention. EDF said: \u201cWe have carried out all the environmental impact assessments (EIA) required for Hinkley Point C, including assessing any likely significant transboundary impacts. In considering the EIA the UK Planning Inspectorate concluded there was no likelihood of significant transboundary effects.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "US markets have followed Europe into the red in early trading, as weaker than expected jobs numbers dampen investor enthusiasm. Dow Jones: -0.5% at 21,365 S&amp;P 500: -0.6% at 2,419 Nasdaq: -1% at 5,595 On that note, we\u2019re closing up for the day. Thanks for all the comments and please join us again tomorrow. AM Over in Greece, shop keepers and small retailers have announced a 24-hour strike later this month in opposition to government moves to liberalise Sunday trade. Helena Smith reports from Athens: On Thursday it was far from clear how Greece\u2019s leftist-led government would deal with mounting opposition to the liberalisation of Sunday trade \u2013 something that its creditors have demanded before releasing \u20ac8.5bn of bailout funds. Hundreds of small retailers took to the streets of central Athens today to protest the measure as unionists called for a strike on 16 July. \u201cSunday should be a day of rest \u2026 small shops can\u2019t compete with the big monopolies which stand to gain from such opening hours,\u201d said one store owner named Lina. Stores attempting to trade on Sundays have recently been at the centre of protest with irate demonstrators often daubing them with cans of paint. Although finance minister Euclid Tskalotos insisted the issue had been resolved, the Hellenic Confederation of Commerce and Entrepreneurship (ESEE) - the body representing opponents - has threatened to take the case to the country\u2019s highest administrative court. Protestors have won the backing of Greece\u2019s powerful Orthodox church which has emerged as one of the strongest defenders of the \u201cnever on Sunday\u201d campaign. With the exception of tourist areas, shops across Greece (in stark contrast to other EU states) remain firmly shuttered on the seventh day of the week. The Greek government has, at the behest of lenders, until tomorrow to stipulate areas outside central Athens where shops will stay open on Sunday. The US trade deficit with the rest of the world fell to $46.5bn in May from $47.6bn in April, the Commerce Department said. When adjusted for inflation, the trade gap narrowed to $62.8bn from $63.8bn. The shrinking deficit was driven by record high goods exports, boosted by petroleum sales. Exports of consumer goods such as mobile phones and other household goods also rose, as did exports of cars and car parts. Food exports fell however amid a decline in soybean shipments. Michael Pearce, US economist at Capital Economics, said export growth was likely to strengthen further in the world\u2019s largest economy. The survey evidence suggests that annual export growth will accelerate from here, reflecting the strength of the global economy and the slight depreciation of the US dollar since the beginning of the year. That is a big change from the situation just a few years ago, when the sharp appreciation of the dollar caused the trade deficit to rise. Net trade subtracted 0.7 percentage points from growth in 2015 and 0.1 points in 2016. We\u2019ve had two separate US jobs reports, both weaker than expected. First the ADP employment report, which showed the private sector created 158,000 jobs in June. It was a drop from the 230,000 jobs created in May, and fewer than the 185,000 predicted by economists polled by Reuters. Meanwhile, there were 248,000 new claims for jobless benefits last week according to the US Labor Department. That was 4,000 more than the previous week and 5,000 more than expected. A spokesman for the Treasury has responded to the news that household disposable income per head fell by 2% in the first three months of 2017. He said the government was already helping households, including through the introduction last year of a higher minimum wage for workers over-25s, known as the national living wage. We are taking real action to help families increase their incomes and take home more of what they earn. A basic rate taxpayer now pays \u00a31,000 less income tax than in 2010 and thanks to the national living wage the poorest households have seen their wages rise more than in any other G7 economy. It\u2019s not been a great morning for the financial markets. Shares are down across Europe, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 shedding 51 points, or 0.75%. Bonds are also falling, as the rise in German bond yields triggers a wider selloff. Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says geopolitical anxiety is swirling through the City. Geopolitical tensions, oil volatility and Brexit negotiations are all conspiring to keep markets on the back foot this morning. The G20 meeting and Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Poland flag up the many problems besetting global leaders, from Russia via Saudi Arabia/Qatar, Syria and finally on to North Korea. The world seems to be at loggerheads, and this flow of negativity means that bullish sentiment is being held firmly in check. Over in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank has just released the minutes of last month\u2019s governing council meeting. They show that the ECB was worried about spooking the markets, as it inches towards unwinding its stimulus package. The minutes state that: \u201cit was necessary to avoid signals that could trigger a premature tightening of financial conditions\u201d. Even \u2018small and incremental changes\u2019 could be misinterpreted, the minutes continue (you can almost hear an exasperated sigh from the ECB\u2019s top brass). That\u2019s ironic, though, as the markets did *indeed* overreact to an upbeat speech by Mario Draghi last week, sending the euro soaring.... Jamie McGeever of Reuters tweets: Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, is concerned that the ONS report shows that people feel more confident about their financial situation, even though incomes are falling. He fears that some households simply aren\u2019t aware how badly they\u2019re being squeezed. The pressure is ratcheting up on UK households, but consumers don\u2019t seem to be fully aware of the crunch that is underway. They have clocked rising prices, but as yet don\u2019t see this has significantly dented their finances. They may well be right, inflation takes time to really bite into household budgets, but the risk is by the time it\u2019s happened, it could be too late to do much about it. Peter Dowd MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, agrees with the TUC that the 1% public sector pay cap must go: \u201cFalling household incomes are just the latest example of the economic failures of this government. \u201cThe largest fall in household income per head in six years is deeply concerning as it further suggests that wages are not keeping up with prices, and the government have no answers to this serious problem. \u201cAlong with stagnant GDP per person, it\u2019s more bad news for working families. And it further exposes the economic record of the Tories, who have overseen falling living standards since coming to power in 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need investment to create the high skill, high wage economy of the future. The Tories could start to help ease the burden on hard working people by lifting their public sector pay cap, and end the cuts to in-work benefits.\u201d Following a somewhat disastrous general election, Theresa May\u2019s cabinet appears to be split over this issue. \u201cSources\u201d have suggested that foreign secretary Boris Johnson thinks the cap could be lifted in a \u201cresponsible way\u201d, but chancellor Philip Hammond is pushing back, muttering darkly about the importance of \u201csound money\u201d.... Earlier today, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation warned that more families were struggling to achieve a decent standard of living. Here\u2019s a flavour: Rising inflation and less generous state benefits have made it harder over the past year for families on tight budgets to enjoy what the public considers a decent standard of living, according to one of Britain\u2019s leading thinktanks. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) said that despite an above-inflation increase in the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, low-income families were falling further behind a minimum income standard. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is urging the government to respond to the squeeze on household incomes. With real incomes slumping by 2%, O\u2019Grady argues that the 1% cap on public sector pay rises must be abolished. She says: \u201cHaving just lived through the longest wage squeeze since Victorian times, their living standards are in freefall again. \u201cThe government cannot sit on its hands and watch this crisis unfold. It needs to help create better-paid jobs in the parts of Britain that need them most. And it must lift the unfair pay restrictions on public sector workers.\u201d The pay cap is turning into a real hot potato for the government, as public workers workers count the cost of almost a decade of austerity. We learned this week that teachers and police officers have suffered significant pay cuts, in real terms, while the nation\u2019s nurses have seen their pay stagnate. It\u2019s official: British families have become poorer this year, as rising inflation hits people in the pocket. Real household disposable income per head fell by 2% in the first three months of 2017, according to a new report into Economic Wellbeing. It\u2019s the biggest squeeze on household incomes since 2011, says the Office for National Statistics, which blames \u201cincreasing prices of goods and services\u201d. Dominic Webber, head of economic well-being at the ONS, explains: \u201cWith prices rising and wage growth still modest, real household disposable income per head has now fallen at its fastest rate in over five years. This chart shows how real disposable incomes have fallen since last summer, when the pound tumbled after the Brexit vote. Sterling\u2019s decline has driven up inflation. It hit 2.9% in May and is rising faster than wages, meaning people\u2019s earnings are simply worth less. The FT\u2019s Sarah O\u2019Connor sums it up: The ONS found that various sources of income have slowed or fallen in recent quarters, including property, welfare benefits. The report also shows that GDP per head was flat in the first three months of 2017, even though GDP increased by 0.2%. But despite these challenges, consumers reported an improvement in their perception of their own financial situation and the general economic situation over the last year, the ONS adds. Here\u2019s the ONS\u2019s latest economic wellbeing dashboard: There\u2019s drama in the bond market, as Germany\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond hits its lowest level since January 2016. This has driven the yield (or interest rate) on the 10-year bund up to 0.5% [yields rise when prices fall] That\u2019s still a very low level in historic terms, but it suggests that investors are adjusting to the prospect that central bankers are moving towards unwinding their huge stimulus programmes. Back in London, the head of the UK\u2019s financial watchdog is calling for a transition period to help the City cope with Brexit. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, argues that this would avoid serious market disruption. Otherwise, firms might have to push the button on their contingency plans in case Britain exits the EU without a deal. Bailey told an event organised by Reuters that \u201cWhat it looks like is to be able to continue with current arrangements while whatever comes next is put into effect. It needs to be a sensible period.\u201d During his speech, Bailey argues that Britain needs to keep \u201cclose regulatory and supervisory links with the EU\u201d, or risk undermining the progress made since the financial crisis. Bailey also hinted at the disruption that Brexit has caused to the FSA\u2019s plans: Quite simply, our job at the FCA is to get on with it, to roll our sleeves up and play our part in implementing the decision made by the people of this country to leave the European Union (EU), and what goes with it. I can\u2019t deny that Brexit is a lot of work, and it did not feature in our business planning as a reality until a year or so ago, so a lot of sleeves have had to be rolled up. Analysts at Investec believe that Reckitt\u2019s profit margins and turnover will both be hit by the Petya attack. They warn: \u201cWe expect an impact both on top line, through disruption to production, order handling and logistics, and margin, through the need to upgrade systems and recover data.\u201d Rainer Sartoris, economist at HSBC, isn\u2019t too impressed by the 1% rise in German factory orders in May. He\u2019s concerned that domestic orders declined (taking the shine off a rise in foreign orders). In May, industrial orders rose by 1.0% month-on-month after falling by 2.2% m-o-m, undershooting consensus expectations of a 1.9% rebound. Domestic orders were particularly weak, which raises questions about the strength of the recovery of investment in machinery and equipment. Despite the disappointing reading in May, orders are still heading for an increase in Q2 but the official data continues to underperform the high optimism in the leading indicators. Charlie Huggins, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes Reckitt Benckiser will recovery from the Petya attack. He says: The effects of the cyber-attack should prove temporary, while some of the other headwinds holding back sales in the first and second quarter should abate in the second half. As a result, we expect sales to recover relatively quickly. Other businesses need to learn the lessons of Petya, Huggins adds: Cyber crime is fast becoming the number one risk for companies which is absorbing greater resources and management time. But the reputational cost of getting this wrong can be significant so its vital businesses commit the appropriate resources to reassure investors. Although Petya and WannaCry have stolen the headlines recently, companies have been facing a daily battle against cybercrime. Beaming, an internet service provider for businesses, reports that the number of cyber attacks targeting UK-based businesses increased by more than 50% in April-to-June. That includes a steep jump in attempts to hack company databases: Sonia Blizzard, managing director of Beaming, explains: \u201cMajor organisations have been brought to their knees to by global cyber attacks and our research shows the likes of Wannacry are just the tip of the iceberg. UK businesses were targeted more than 700 times each on a daily basis by hackers over the last three months, who focused on hijacking connected devices and databases.\u201d Reckitt wasn\u2019t the only major company bitten by the Petya ransomware attack, and today\u2019s statement sheds new light on the damage it has caused. Advertising giant WPP, shipping magnate Maersk and food company Mondelez all fell victim to Petya, which encrypted key files and demanded $300 to release them. Some 76 of Maersk\u2019s ports were affected, and on Tuesday it revealed that the repair job was ongoing. It said: \u201cWe\u2019re bringing applications online according to priority and to restore critical business functions. Before we can say that we are totally up and running we really need more systems to be up, such as back-up systems for employees here.\u201d Security experts believe that Petya was actually intended to cause destruction, rather than to elicit money form victims. Shares in Reckitt Benckiser have hit a seven-week low in early trading, and are the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Reckitt shares are down 2% at \u00a375.28, as City investors react to the news that its sales have been hit by the Petya cyber attack. Now this is interesting. Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer goods giant, has warned that its sales have been hit by last month\u2019s global cyber-attack, forcing it to cut its sales forecasts. The company, which makes Dettol disinfectant, Nurofen painkillers and the wackily named Cillit Bang cleaning products, was caught up in the Petya cyber attack on 27 June. Reckitt reveals that the attack had a serious impact - leaving it unable to satisfy orders or even make some products. It says: The attack did disrupt the company\u2019s ability to manufacture and distribute products to customers in multiple markets across the RB Group. Consequently, we were unable to ship and invoice some orders to customers prior to the close of the quarter. Some of our factories are currently still not operating normally but plans are in place to return to full operation Nine days later, it says that it has made \u201cgood progress\u201d in getting key systems back online so it can start trading normally again. But the cost is significant; Reckitt admits that the attack will knock 2% off its like-for-like revenue growth this quarter. And some revenue will be lost permanently. This means that Reckitt now only expects to achieve full year like-for-like net revenue growth of around +2%, down from +3% previously. The company made net revenues of \u00a39,891m last year; so by my back-of-the-envelope calculations, this attack could cost Reckitt around \u00a3100m of revenue*. [* - currency fluctuations mean it\u2019s hard to be too precise] Dirk Schlotboeller, an economist at Germany\u2019s Chambers of Commerce (DIHK), has cheered the 1% rise in German factory orders in May. He says (via Reuters): \u201cThe German industrial sector is back in form and the decline in April was likely a one-off. Although increasing protectionism around the world is dampening the mood, business is going extremely well in Europe, Asia and also in the USA. Germany has got the day off to a decent start, by reporting a rise in manufacturing orders. Factory orders rose by 1% in May, reversing April\u2019s 2.2% decline, and indicating that there\u2019s still demand for goods from the eurozone\u2019s largest economy. The recovery was driven by foreign orders, which jumped by 3%, including a 1.7% rise in orders from other eurozone countries. That made up for a 1.7% drop in domestic demand. Economists had actually expected a bigger bounce-back after the April lull. But these factory figures are pretty volatile, and Germany\u2019s economy ministry are confident that its industrial base remains strong. It says: \u201cThe solid development in orders, as well as the excellent business climate, signal further moderate upward momentum in manufacturing.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s an edgy feel in the markets today, as investors anticipate a bruising G20 meeting in Hamburg tomorrow. Trade and climate change will be high on the agenda, which means Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra is likely to clash with other leaders. Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank, says the G20 meeting is a geopolitical risk, as: Trump could end up totally isolated versus the rest of the \u2018G19\u2019. Theresa May, the UK PM, is expected to tell Trump that Britain still backs the Paris climate change agreement. The two leaders could also discuss North Korea\u2019s latest missile test \u2013 another potential geopolitical risk. And with police bracing for riots on the streets, it could be a difficult few days in Germany\u2019s second-largest city. Traders are also digesting the minutes of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s June meeting, released last night. They showed that Fed policymakers were split over how to interpret the latest inflation figures, and how that affects interest rate rises. The minutes say that: \u201cMost participants viewed the recent softness in these price data as largely reflecting idiosyncratic factors...however, several participants expressed concern that progress...might have slowed and that the recent softness in inflation might persist.\u201d The European Central Bank releases its own minutes latest today; they\u2019ll be scrutinised for signs of dissent between its hawkish and dovish wings. We also get the weekly US jobless figures, and the estimate of private sector employment for June. They could move the markets, as tomorrow is Non-Farm Payroll Day, when the full US labour report for June is released.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "France will end sales of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 as part of an ambitious plan to meet its targets under the Paris climate accord, Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government has announced. The announcement comes a day after Volvo said it would only make fully electric or hybrid cars from 2019 onwards, a decision hailed as the beginning of the end for the internal combustion engine\u2019s dominance of motor transport after more than a century. Nicolas Hulot, the country\u2019s new ecology minister, said: \u201cWe are announcing an end to the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040.\u201d Hulot added that the move was a \u201cveritable revolution\u201d. He said it would be a \u201ctough\u201d objective for carmakers but France\u2019s industry was well equipped to make the switch. \u201cOur [car]makers have enough ideas in the drawer to nurture and bring about this promise ... which is also a public health issue.\u201d Hulot insisted that the decision was a question of public health policy and \u201ca way to fight against air pollution\u201d. The veteran environmental campaigner was among several political newcomers to whom Macron gave top jobs in his government. Pascal Canfin, the head of WWF France and a former Green politician who served in Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government, said the new policy platform to counter climate change went further than previous administrations in France. \u201cIt places France among the leaders of climate action in the world,\u201d he told France Inter radio. Prof David Bailey, an automotive industry expert at Aston University, said: \u201cThe timescale involved here is sufficiently long term to be taken seriously. If enacted it would send a very clear signal to manufacturers and consumers of the direction of travel and may accelerate a transition to electric cars.\u201d Norway, which has the highest penetration of electric cars in the world, has set a target of only allowing sales of 100% electric or plug-in hybrid cars by 2025. Other countries have floated the idea of banning cars powered by an internal combustion engine to meet air quality and climate change goals, but have not yet passed concrete targets. The Netherlands has mooted a 2025 ban for diesel and petrol cars, and some federal states in Germany are keen on a 2030 phase-out. India, where scores of cities are blighted by dangerous air pollution, is mulling the idea of no longer selling petrol or diesel cars by 2030, and said it wants to introduce electric cars in \u201ca very big way\u201d. The UK has an aspiration of all new cars being electric or ultra low emission by 2040, but has been criticised by campaigners and politicans for being slow to act on air pollution. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: \u201cI welcome the strong leadership the French government has shown by making the decision to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040. \u201cThis radical step shames the timid and insufficient response of our own government to the health threat posed by poor air quality.\u201d France\u2019s announcement came as Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicted electric cars would come to dominate the automotive market more quickly and dramatically than previously thought. Electric vehicles will make up 54% of all light-duty vehicle sales by 2040, up from the 35% share Bloomberg was forecasting just last year, according to a new report by the research group. Bloomberg said such a widespread uptake of electric vehicles would globally reduce oil demand by 8m barrels a day and increase electricity consumption by 5% to charge all the new cars. But Tony Seba, a Stanford University economist who has published research predicting electric cars will even more rapidly take over from conventional cars, said of France\u2019s plan: \u201cBanning sales of diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2040 is a bit like banning sales of horses for road transportation by 2040: there won\u2019t be any to ban.\u201d French car manufacturers Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and Renault ranked first, second and third on a 2016 list of large car manufacturers with the lowest carbon emissions, the European Environment Agency said. Just 0.6% of new car registrations across the EU last year were for pure electric vehicles, compared with 1.1% of new cars sold in France. French-Japanese carmaker Renault-Nissan has been an enthusiastic early advocate for the vehicles, taking 14.6% of the EU market share for battery-powered vehicles. The firm has built 425,000 of the more than 2m electric cars sold globally. France\u2019s reliance on nuclear power stations for 80% of its electricity supply means that a shift to electric vehicles rather than oil-powered ones would dramatically cut its remaining carbon emissions.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has described himself as a \u201cpower drinker\u201d and dismissed his \u00a32.2bn fortune as \u201cwallpaper\u201d at the high court. The tracksuits and trainers tycoon is defending claims he agreed to pay a banker \u00a315m while binge drinking in a London pub. He told the court on Thursday that he could not remember making any such deal with former banker and colleague Jeff Blue. He said he would have downed the first four pints of the session in about an hour and told how the beers were \u201ccoming like machine guns\u201d every few minutes that night. \u201cI like to get drunk, I\u2019m a power drinker,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cMy thing is not to drink regularly, it\u2019s to binge drink. I\u2019m trying to get drunk \u2013 will you accept that? I was drinking to get pissed and have a good night out.\u201d Ashley, the 54th wealthiest person in the UK according to the Sunday Times rich list, told the high court his fortune was mostly tied up in Sports Direct\u2019s shares and he could only realise the money if he sold them, which he did not intend to do. \u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019m worth \u00a32bn less [than] when the shares were at \u00a39?\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference until you sell them if they\u2019re worth \u00a320-a-share \u2013 they\u2019re wallpaper.\u201d Sports Direct shares peaked at 922p in 2014 but are now changing hands at 298p. Ashley told the court this week that he was so \u201cfabulously wealthy\u201d that he didn\u2019t know what to spend his money on when Sports Direct floated on the stock market 10 years ago and made him a paper billionaire. \u201cWhat do you think I did in the morning \u2013 went out and bought the neighbour\u2019s house? I already owned it.\u201d When Ashley invited the media to Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse last year in an attempt to dispell the impression that working conditions were similar to a \u201cgulag\u201d, he revealed a wad of \u00a350 notes as he made his way through security. I\u2019ve just been to the casino,\u201d he said at the time before adding: \u201cDon\u2019t write that.\u201d Ashley is defending himself against allegations that during a \u201cnight of heavy drinking\u201d in January 2013 he agreed to pay Blue \u00a315m if Sports Direct\u2019s shares doubled to \u00a38. The shares did hit \u00a38 but have since collapsed, in part because of reputational damage caused by a Guardian investigation that revealed the retailer was in effect paying staff in its warehouse less than the minimum wage. A report by MPs later accused Ashley of running Sports Direct like a \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d. Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United football club, said he would rather have \u201cput needles in my eyes\u201d than go to the meeting with boring bankers at the Horse &amp; Groom pub in Fitzrovia, central London, in January 2013. But he said he had been asked by Blue to make it a \u201cfun night\u201d and started drinking quickly. Ashley said he would have had four to five pints within the first hour. \u201cWe would have had the first pint in between five and 10 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second pint would probably be between 10 and, longest case, 15 minutes. The third pint is what 30 minute-ish \u2013 you\u2019re slowing down by then.\u201d Jeffrey Chapman QC, Blue\u2019s lawyer, put it to Ashley that his recollection of drinking quite so many pints so quickly might not be true because he had not factored in the time taken to go to the bar and order more drinks. Ashley said it was the \u201cjob\u201d of another banker in the pub to \u201cget the drinks in\u201d. \u201cHe got the drinks in before the round was finished \u2026 they were coming like machine guns.\u201d The businessman said he did not want to go the pub meeting with City brokers but Blue had \u201call but begged\u201d him to go and told him to make it a fun night and impress the brokers with his larger-than-life personality. Ashley said he would have made Blue keep pace with the drinking early on, but doubted that he would have been able to keep up. \u201cHe\u2019s a lightweight when it comes to drinking \u2013 that\u2019s a fact \u2013 and he wouldn\u2019t have been physically able to keep up.\u201d Blue claims Ashley often conducts business in pubs, casinos and various other \u201cunusual venues\u201d while under the influence of alcohol and the meeting\u2019s venue should not invalidate the alleged deal. This week, Blue gave the court an extraordinary picture of Ashley\u2019s working practices, including a claim that he would challenge subordinates to extreme drinking competitions that once ended with the 52-year-old billionaire vomiting into a fireplace. Asked whether Ashley took calls about player transfers at Newcastle United during the meeting in the pub, he said he could not recall that and that managers at his club were \u201creally not interested in my opinion on football\u201d. \u201cDo you think I make the decisions for Newcastle United?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like the last person to know.\u201d Ashley denied Blue\u2019s allegations that he paid senior Sports Direct managers multimillion-pound bonuses from his personal funds to artificially keep down the pay of other staff. \u201cHe knows that\u2019s lies. Jeff Blue knows that\u2019s utter bullshit,\u201d Ashley told the court on Wednesday. He said he had never made any payments of more than \u00a31m to any Sports Direct employees. Blue had made the claim based on a conversation with Peter Cowgill, the boss of JD Sports, a rival of Sports Direct. Cowgill told the court on Thursday that he had no knowledge of the senior management\u2019s pay. Ashley clarified on Thursday that he had paid his brother John, who was in charge of IT at Sports Direct, \u201cmillions of pounds\u201d. The case continues.",

      "bodyText": "Rising prices in the wake of the Brexit vote have put the tightest squeeze on household incomes for more than five years, according to official figures on Britons\u2019 economic wellbeing. In the opening three months of 2017, real household disposable income per head dropped 2% from the previous year. It was the steepest decline since the end of 2011 and driven by increasing prices of goods and services, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The figures add to evidence of falling living standards in the months running up to the general election when the Conservatives failed to win a majority. Households have been hit by a double whammy of slow wage growth and rising inflation. The pound\u2019s weakness since the EU referendum last summer has made imports to the UK more expensive and firms are passing their higher costs on to consumers. Inflation hit a four-year high of 2.9% on the latest measure. That has meant a return to wages falling in real terms, which adjusts for the effects of inflation. Workers had already suffered years of declining real wages in the wake of the financial crisis, but then real pay started rising again in 2014. The latest figures confirmed Britain was experiencing a renewed squeeze on living standards, said Dan Tomlinson, researcher at the Resolution Foundation thinktank. \u201cWhile no one expects it to be as bad as the last one, the fact that the fall in household incomes at the start of 2017 was the biggest in over five years is a huge cause for concern,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to rise to this economic challenge, alongside tackling the political ones associated with ongoing Brexit negotiations.\u201d A spokesman for the Treasury said the government was already helping households, for example with the introduction last year of a higher minimum wage for workers over 25 known as the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. \u201cWe are taking real action to help families increase their incomes and take home more of what they earn. A basic-rate taxpayer now pays \u00a31,000 less income tax than in 2010 and, thanks to the national living wage, the poorest households have seen their wages rise more than in any other G7 economy,\u201d he said. In its latest healthcheck on household finances, the ONS said that despite the hit to real incomes, consumer confidence had brightened in the first quarter of this year. Compared with the previous three months, people\u2019s perception of the general economic situation improved slightly from a balance of -23.3 to -21.8. But the negative balance was still suggesting that households\u2019 perception of the general economic situation was \u201cunfavourable, potentially because of the decline in the UK\u2019s currency and rising inflation\u201d, the ONS report said. Between the same two quarters, consumers also reported an improvement in their perception of their own financial situation. That balance increased from 0.7 in December 2016 to 1.2 in March 2017, the ONS said, using a survey conducted by researchers GFK on behalf of the European commission. The report will add fuel to the debate over how content households are to dip into savings or to borrow in order to keep spending at the same pace. Consumer spending has been a key driver of UK growth and so pressures on household finances are widely expected to dent economic momentum this year and next. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the findings suggested UK consumers \u201ccould be sleepwalking into financial difficulties\u201d. \u201cThe pressure is ratcheting up on UK households, but consumers don\u2019t seem to be fully aware of the crunch that is under way,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite weak wage growth and rising prices, consumers are continuing to spend by racking up more debt. That of course helps keep the wheels of the economy turning, but stores up problems for the future.\u201d The TUC said the figures showed Britons had enjoyed only a brief period of financial respite since the last squeeze on living standards. \u201cBritons are getting poorer,\u201d said the TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cHaving just lived through the longest wage squeeze since Victorian times, their living standards are in freefall again. The government cannot sit on its hands and watch the crisis unfold. It needs to help create better-paid jobs in the parts of Britain that need them most. And lift the unfair pay restrictions on public sector workers.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Peter Dowd, echoed the call for the government to remove the cap on public sector pay rises, which has seen teachers, nurses, police officers and other workers employed by the state fall behind those in the private sector. Responding to the ONS figures, Dowd said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need investment to create the high-skill, high-wage economy of the future. The Tories could start to help ease the burden on hardworking people by lifting their public sector pay cap, and end the cuts to in-work benefits.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Some of the world\u2019s biggest companies are counting the cost of lost business following last week\u2019s \u201cNotPetya\u201d ransomware cyber-attack, with Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser taking an estimated \u00a3100m hit in revenue. Reckitt \u2013 which also makes Dettol cleaning products and Durex condoms \u2013 said the attack on 27 June had disrupted production and deliveries of goods to customers in several countries. \u201cConsequently, we were unable to ship and invoice some orders to customers prior to the close of the quarter,\u201d the British consumer goods company said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cSome of our factories are currently still not operating normally but plans are in place to return to full operation.\u201d Last week\u2019s attack affected some of the world\u2019s biggest corporate names, including the UK-based advertising group WPP, Danish shipping company AP Moller-Maersk, and US delivery service FedEx. Anthony Dagostino, head of global cyber-risk at Willis Towers Watson, said such attacks were starting to take a greater toll on businesses. \u201cWe\u2019ve really crossed the threshold into new territory regarding damages sustained from an attack. No longer is it limited to data and privacy compromise with expenses incurred to remediate the breach. Now we\u2019re seeing disruption to supply chains and production, material loss of income, and physical damage becoming more of a reality.\u201d Reckitt Benckiser said it was still assessing the financial impact of the attack on the company. \u201cWe expect that some of the revenue lost from the second quarter will be recovered in the third quarter. However, the continued production difficulties in some factories mean that we also expect to lose some further revenue permanently.\u201d The Slough-based company now expects like-for-like net revenue in 2017 to increase by about 2%, down from an earlier growth forecast of 3%. With the company making almost \u00a310bn in revenues in 2016, that would equate to about \u00a3100m in lost revenue. It said a new goods and sales tax in India also resulted in reduced orders from some customers in June. Reckitt\u2019s shares were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 in early trading on Thursday, down 2%. Eddy Hargreaves, analysts at Investec bank, said that profits and turnover would both be hit: \u201cThe cost of recovery from the recent cyber-attack on Reckitt\u2019s operations is still being assessed by management. But we expect an impact both on top line, through disruption to production, order handling and logistics, and margin, through the need to upgrade systems and recover data.\u201d The company has operations in more than 60 countries and sells its products around the world, employing about 37,000 people globally. The sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote has benefited companies like Reckitt Benckiser, because it has significant operations outside the UK. Maersk, the world\u2019s largest shipping company, said it had been forced to redirect ships to alternative locations after the attack on its computer systems left it unable to dock and unload containers at some of its ports. In its latest message to customers the company said its operations were now \u201crunning close to normal again\u201d, but it was still experiencing some issues such as disruption to phone lines in some regions. Charlie Huggins, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Reckitt should recover from the NotPetya attack. \u201cThe effects of the cyber-attack should prove temporary, while some of the other headwinds holding back sales in the first and second quarter should abate in the second half. As a result, we expect sales to recover relatively quickly. \u201cCybercrime is fast becoming the number one risk for companies, which is absorbing greater resources and management time. But the reputational cost of getting this wrong can be significant so its vital businesses commit the appropriate resources to reassure investors.\u201d Neil Campling, analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said this latest attack was a wake-up call for firms. \u201cCompanies all over the world will be reviewing the robustness of their hard and soft procedures to ensure they\u2019ve done everything possible to protect themselves from hackers and others who might wish to disrupt normal operations,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The European Union and Japan are on course to sign a trade deal on Thursday, after talks gained impetus in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put up barriers to international commerce. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European trade commissioner, announced she had reached a political agreement with the Japanese foreign minister, Fumio Kishida: \u201cWe ironed out the few remaining differences in the EU-Japan trade negotiations,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cWe now recommend to leaders to confirm this at summit.\u201d Japanese prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe will meet Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, presidents of the European council and commission respectively, for a one- day summit in Brussels, before the G20 gathering in Hamburg. The timing is no coincidence, as Germany plans to make free trade one of the summit priorities. In a sign of high hopes, Malmstr\u00f6m and Kishida exchanged Daruma dolls, armless, headless round figures associated with persistence and luck. A part of Zen Buddhist culture, people typically paint one eye when they make a wish and the second when the goal has been reached. Malmstr\u00f6m and Kishida posed for the cameras, as they coloured in the second eyes on two dolls emblazoned with the EU and Japanese flags. But officials might be looking for divine intervention to overcome the final hurdles. Despite a likely agreement on Thursday, the sensitive subject of a court system to settle investor disputes remains open. Japan has not accepted the EU\u2019s preferred alternative to the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), a system for resolving trade disputes that has been criticised by unions and activists for giving too much power to corporations. Under pressure from NGOs, the EU proposed a new kind of trade court, where judges would be appointed by governments rather than disputing parties. But Tokyo has not come round to this idea. EU sources declined to speculate on how quickly the deal could come into force, but fine-tuning and translating the legal text, as well as getting it agreed by all EU member states could take many months. It took the EU and Canada three years to sign a final text, following the agreement in principle in October 2013, which parallels the latest EU-Japan milestone. The Canada deal almost collapsed when a Belgian region threatened to veto the treaty. Now mostly in force, the EU-Canada deal still needs to clear the final hurdle of ratification by at least 38 national and regional assemblies. The timetable means it is likely the UK will have left the EU by the time the Japan treaty comes into force. When negotiations began with Tokyo in 2013, Britain was one of the biggest cheerleaders. The then UK trade minister described talks as an \u201cimportant step towards liberalising trade between two of the world\u2019s largest economies\u201d. Following the Brexit vote, Theresa May has vowed to leave the customs union, meaning British exporters are unlikely to see any benefits from the EU deal. The deal means Japan will drop tariffs on many valuable European imports, including chocolate, pasta and some types of cheese. In return for liberalisation of Japan\u2019s highly protected dairy market, Europe has compromised by agreeing to lower tariffs on Japanese imported cars, although new rules will be phased in to help European carmakers deal with the change. Services and an array of technical standards are also covered by the treaty, which negotiators say goes far further than old-style tariff-cutting agreements.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has been accused of undermining the Fairtrade movement by experimenting with dropping the ethical mark for its own label tea. A series of shareholders and campaign groups criticised the supermarket group for dropping Fairtrade at its annual meeting in London on Wednesday, in an increasingly fraught exchange with the company\u2019s board. Outside the event, protesters carried placards expressing their concern at the development. The protests follow Sainsbury\u2019s recent pilot in which it no longer labels its own-brand teas as Fairtrade, badging them \u201cfairly traded\u201d instead. The company said it was running a pilot with its tea products \u2013 but those opposing the change fear it will be extended to other products, including bananas and coffee. Anne Lindsay, a private-sector analyst from Cafod, the Catholic charity, said to the board: \u201cI am concerned that after years of being an extremely valuable champion of Fairtrade, Sainsbury\u2019s is starting in a direction that could undermine Fairtrade and lead to a plethora of different standards by different companies and confusion for consumers.\u201d Another shareholder said: \u201cI have seen the publicity about the proposed change from Fairtrade to \u2018fairly traded\u2019 tea. I have come across the term fairly traded when I have shopped in budget chains. I don\u2019t know what it means and I don\u2019t think most people who shop in Sainsbury\u2019s do either.\u201d She said information on how Sainsbury\u2019s scheme would work was \u201csketchy\u201d and that it was not clear who would decide how the premium paid for ethically traded goods would be distributed to farmers and communities. Some other shareholders, who nearly missed out on asking questions as Sainsbury\u2019s chairman David Tyler tried to bring the meeting to a close, accused the company of trying to stifle debate. At least one campaigner was not able to ask a question at all. \u201cAre you now reasserting the power of the retailer against that of the producer \u2013 taking back control \u2013 and putting developing world producers back in the subservient role that Fairtrade redeems them from?\u201d said Douglas James, an independent shareholder. He said recognition of the Fairtrade mark outshone that of any other ethical mark and was \u201cthe envy of the marketing world, the gold standard\u201d. \u201cWhat do you hope to achieve by giving up the moral high ground and the kudos you currently enjoy and going it alone as yet another self-defining brand?\u201d Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, defended the change at the AGM, saying the company was \u201ctrying to bring clarity to a very complicated environment\u201d, which encompassed many different ethical standards and labels. He said the changes being made on tea products were a pilot and Sainsbury\u2019s was committed to a transparent review of how well it worked with the seven producer groups involved. \u201cWe are committed to the standards Fairtrade currently apply but we have to move on to ensure we cover social, environmental and economically sustainable standards around the world.\u201d He said Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cdidn\u2019t want to mark its own homework\u201d and would work with independent groups to verify its practices. But he suggested Fairtrade had become outdated. \u201cIt might have been fit for purpose 25 years ago, but we\u2019re in a new world with new technology,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Mike Rake, the chairman of Worldpay, should go back to the drawing board. His first attempt to sell the FTSE 100 card processing company deserves to be declined by his own shareholders. On Tuesday, when Worldpay revealed it had received takeover approaches, City analysts speculated the bidding could go as high as 500p a share. This, after all, is supposed to be a rock solid business with a commanding 40% share of the UK market and positions in 140 other countries. But Rake and his board have agreed terms with Vantiv, the US market leader, at just 385p a share, or \u00a37.67bn. Given that Worldpay\u2019s shares traded at 320p on Monday, the takeover premium is miserable. To compound shareholders\u2019 disappointment, the other possible bidder \u2013 JP Morgan \u2013 immediately dropped out of the race. So Rake hasn\u2019t even generated an auction, which is usually deemed the chairman\u2019s first duty in these situations. The case for the defence is that the takeover is really a 60-40 merger to be executed mainly in shares, so Worldpay\u2019s investors can enjoy a long-term ride and the benefits of slamming the two operations together. Companies often offer this wishy-washy line, and it is rarely convincing. Here the talk is of \u201csubstantial opportunity for cost synergies\u201d but there is not even an early estimate of an actual figure. Details will have to follow, of course, and any bidder in the wings now knows the terms it has to beat. In that regard, Worldpay investors can console themselves that the tale may not be over. Yet a rushed overnight negotiation represents a poor start and it has produced a boardroom arrangement that looks a muddle. Worldpay\u2019s chief executive, Philip Jansen, gets to wear the title of co-chief executive but he won\u2019t really be an equal because Vantiv\u2019s Charles Drucker, the co-boss, will also be executive chairman. The shame is that Worldpay, which grew out of Royal Bank of Scotland, ought to be using its domestic strength to be an acquirer itself. The e-commerce era, remember, is meant to herald a golden age for card processors. One can blame a few setbacks in the US, or the fall in the value of sterling, which has encouraged US rivals to Worldpay\u2019s door. Yet the real culprit may be lack of ambition in the boardroom. Companies only get to sell themselves once and a business with Worldpay\u2019s healthy long-term prospects should only be submitting to a knock-out offer. Surrender on these terms would be short-termist and meek. Persimmon builds stupendous profits on Help to Buy \u201cIsn\u2019t Help to Buy excellent?\u201d, opined Jefferies analyst Anthony Codling as housebuilder Persimmon confirmed business is still booming. He means excellent for the company and its shareholders, and he\u2019s right. Half of Persimmon\u2019s homes are bought by buyers who use the government\u2019s equity loan scheme, and the company\u2019s first-half trading update contained good news followed by splendid news. Selling prices ticked up 3.5% in the first half of the year, profit margins will \u201ccomfortably\u201d exceed the 25.7% in the last half and cash balances stand at \u00a31.1bn. As for the general election, the market took it \u201cin its stride\u201d. On this form, Persimmon\u2019s return on capital employed will be an astonishing 40%-plus this year, better than last year\u2019s 39.4%, which was merely remarkable at the time. So are these stupendous returns being recycled into a building frenzy, thereby proving the wisdom of George Osborne\u2019s prophecy when he introduced Help to Buy in 2013 that, by stimulating demand for houses, he would encourage supply? Of course not \u2013 or, at least, not on a meaningful scale. It is true that Persimmon\u2019s volumes have climbed since 2013 but you\u2019d hardly call the current pace frenetic \u2013 legal completions were 8% higher than a year ago. The strategic priority is the familiar one of dispatching surplus cash to shareholders. Persimmon can be very confident of achieving its ambition to return \u00a32.85bn in capital over a nine-year period that started in 2012. Help to Buy has, obviously, allowed some people to buy homes who would not otherwise have been able to do so. But the case for continuing until 2021 with a scheme on which \u00a34.6bn has been spent already gets weaker by the month. The lending banks are well capitalised these days and the mortgage market is functioning normally. The Help to Buy stimulus is now primarily to housebuilders\u2019 profit margins. Nex causes a stink with Tory donations Michael Spencer, the chief executive of City broker Nex (the old Icap) and former treasurer of the Conservative party, ought to know better. Corporate donations to political parties were deemed generally unacceptable about two decades ago. Nex\u2019s donation of \u00a325,000 of shareholders\u2019 cash to fund five Tory candidates at the general election was bound to provoke a storm. Charles Gregson, Nex\u2019s chairman, has now agreed to reimburse the company out of his own pocket. So he should. While he\u2019s about it, he should drop Nex\u2019s bleat about \u00a325,000 being a \u201cmodest\u201d sum. It\u2019s the principle that stinks. Use your own money, not other people\u2019s.",
