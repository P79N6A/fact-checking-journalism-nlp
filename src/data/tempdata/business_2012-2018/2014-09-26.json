      "bodyText": "Tesco needs to change its culture and reinvent its brand, the company\u2019s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, has told employees after a torrid week for the supermarket chain. In an email to thousands of staff in the wake of a \u00a3250m accounting scandal, Lewis said: \u201cTurning our business around will require change in our culture, as well as in our processes and our brand proposition. We want to work in a business which is open, transparent, fair and honest. We all expect Tesco to act with integrity and transparency at all times.\u201d Shares in Tesco dived 16.5% this week, knocking \u00a33bn off the firm\u2019s value after it found possible errors in the handling of payments from suppliers equivalent to nearly a quarter of its anticipated profits for the first half of this financial year. The revelation came as Tesco sales also fell, down 6.1% in the three months to mid-September according to figures released on Friday by the market analyst Nielsen. That is an even grimmer picture than the 4.5% decline analysts at Kantar Worldpanel envisaged earlier this week. Tesco\u2019s difficulties with supplier payments have sent shockwaves through the industry, in which retailers widely demand such transactions in return for promotions, prime shelf space or hitting certain sales targets. On Friday one of the world\u2019s largest credit rating agencies said supermarkets\u2019 profits could be made up entirely from supplier kickbacks, and called on the retail industry to be more transparent about them. Fitch Ratings suggested payments from suppliers could make up \u20ac5.6bn or 81% of Tesco\u2019s underlying operating profits. Earlier this week the accountants Moore Stephens also estimated such payments to be worth several billions of pounds a year to the top 10 supermarkets. \u201cBetter disclosure would make it easier to spot errors, aggressive accounting policies or misuse: red flags could include a rapid acceleration in attributable allowances, or a continued increase even as sales volumes decline,\u201d Fitch said. \u201cThe extent of vendor allowances in Europe is uncertain, but if they are as widespread as they are in the US they could approach, or even exceed, the entire operating profit of some supermarkets.\u201d While European retailers do not break out contributions from suppliers, some US retailers have revealed that they are equivalent to 8% of the cost of goods sold, or virtually all their profits, according to Fitch. The agency\u2019s comments come as Tesco conducts an internal investigation into its handling of supplier payments which will be closely watched by analysts and regulators. Shareholders and analysts are also preparing to quiz Sainsbury\u2019s about its approach when the supermarket delivers its second quarter trading statement on Wednesday. Worries about how supermarkets generate income come as the industry is experiencing major structural challenges. The rise of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl and the expansion of upmarket Waitrose have meant more competition at a time when shoppers are tightening their belts. Nielsen indicated that shoppers spent 1.6% less at the UK\u2019s leading supermarkets in the four weeks to 13 September, while the volume of items bought sank 1.9%. It also confirmed a poor trading period at Sainsbury\u2019s indicating a 1.8% decline in sales, in line with Kantar\u2019s estimate. On Friday shares in Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Tesco all fell in response to further evidence of difficulties in the market and bearish comments from one of the UK\u2019s most influential fund managers. Neil Woodford, who sold his Tesco shares after it issued its first profit warning for decades in early 2012, said it would take a long time before the company, or other UK supermarkets, are worth investing in. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today progamme that the industry may need a complete overhaul. \u201cThe industry, in the near term, faces a long road to exit this period of depressed margins and crushed profitability, and maybe asset bases [and] balance sheets need to be rebalanced in time before the industry can re-emerge as an investable proposition from my point of view. The immediate future is going to be tough for the sector, but particularly for Tesco,\u201d he said. Woodford managed Britain\u2019s biggest investment fund at Invesco Perpetual before going it alone with his \u00a37bn fund at Woodford Investment Management.",

The European Banking Authority is in the final stages of producing guidance intended to unify the array of practices that banks subject to the bonus cap have employed to avoid having to cut the pay of their key staff. Under a rule which is still being fought by the chancellor, George Osborne, the EU has banned banks from paying bonuses worth more than a banker\u2019s salary, unless shareholders give approval for bonuses of twice the amount. As a result, major banks have devised a series of additional payments \u2013 which have become known as allowances \u2013 which are paid alongside salaries to bolster pay deals. HSBC was one of the first banks to go public with its plans, handing its chief executive Stuart Gulliver \u00a31.7m a year in additional payments. He receives an allowance every three months in shares. Barclays describes similar payments as \u201crole-based pay\u201d. The EBA has been reviewing such practices since June and this week circulated draft proposals for consultation on what characteristics such allowances needed to have to be regarded as fixed pay \u2013 which is not capped \u2013 rather than bonuses, which are. According to the Financial Times, an allowance would need to be based on an individual\u2019s role rather than have any link to performance, and would need to be paid for a set period. Banks should not be able to claw back any of the allowances paid if losses are made and the allowances should be for a preset amount, and not altered at any time. The EBA said that it had not finalised its work on allowances but said it would be \u201cdelivered in coming weeks\u201d. \u201cThe analysis in the report will not be a matter of being more or less conservative on allowances; the task of the EBA is to harmonise practices in the EU banking sector and this report will aim at understanding the features of allowances across the EU single market, so as to be able to make an informed choice on whether these should be classified as fixed or variable remuneration,\u201d the EBA said.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bill Gross, the world renowned investor known as the \u201cbond king\u201d, has dramatically quit the $2tn investment firm he set up more than 40 years ago due to \u201cfundamental differences\u201d with the company. The move sent shockwaves through the global finance industry and triggered a 35% rise in the shares in Janus Capital, the rival fund where the legendary investor will start trading in bonds. Pimco, which stands for Pacific Investment Management Company, announced there had been \u201cfundamental differences\u201d with Gross, who started the business in 1971 and built it into the biggest bond investor in the world. The fund manager, which holds the debt of governments and companies around the world, was sold to Allianz in 2000 and; shares in the German insurer fell 6% on the news, which followed speculation about rifts at the top, an outflow of investors, and an investigation by US regulators. The Wall Street Journal reported that Gross had quit before being pushed. Based in Newport Beach, California, the 70-year-old attracted notoriety in the UK in 2010 by dealing a blow to the then Labour government when he warned that the country\u2019s debt was \u201cresting on a bed of nitroglycerine\u201d and needed to be avoided. The pronouncement proved to be additionally embarrassing as Andrew Balls, brother of the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, is a key figure at the bond investment housePimco. Andrew Balls is now one of the company\u2019s senior executives after being named one of six deputy chief investment officers during a shakeup at the group in January, when Mohamed El-Erian, regarded as Gross\u2019s successor, quit suddenly. According to reports, Balls was promoted along with others while Daniel Ivascyn was elevated to replace Gross. Douglas Hodge, chief executive of Pimco, said a succession plan was in place and a new chief investment officer would be named shortly. He said: \u201cWhile we are grateful for everything Bill contributed to building our firm and delivering value to Pimco\u2019s clients, over the course of this year it became increasingly clear that the firm\u2019s leadership and Bill have fundamental differences about how to take Pimco forward.\u201d Darius McDermott, managing director of FundCalibre, an advisory service, said Gross was a major loss for Pimco. \u201cThis is a seismic event for the fund management industry globally. Despite some performance issues in the last few years, Gross has arguably been the best global bond manager in history.\u201d There are suggestions of a rift between Gross and El-Erian, who said this week his departure was in part triggered by an incident in May 2013, when his then 10-year-old daughter wrote him a list of 22 milestones in her life that he had missed. Speculation that El-Erian could return was dismissed by Pimco, according to reports, and the fund manager was expected to name a successor to Gross before the start of the weekend. \u201cThe obvious succession would be for Mohamed El-Erian to resume his roles but Bloomberg reports that Pimco are denying El-Erian will return,\u201d said Guy Foster, head of research at stockbroker Brewin Dolphin. \u201cPerhaps pre-emptively El-Erian had revealed this week that work/life balance had been the reason he left Pimco, rather than the much-covered souring of his relationship with Bill Gross,\u201d said Foster. US bond yields rose as Gross\u2019s departure was announced, although this coincided with release of economic data in the US, Foster said. But he warned there was a risk of investors pulling more money out of Pimco funds. In August its flagship total return fund reported a 16th consecutive month of outflows. In a statement issued by Janus, Gross gave clues to his reasons for leaving Pimco. \u201cI look forward to returning my full focus to the fixed income markets and investing, giving up many of the complexities that go with managing a large, complicated organisation,\u201d he said. \u201cI chose Janus as my next home because of my long-standing relationship with, and respect for, chief executive officer Dick Weil and my desire to get back to spending the bulk of my day managing client assets.\u201d Gross was also quoted as saying that his decision to quit Pimco \u201cwas not without great thought and deliberation\u201d, wishing his friends and associates at Pimco continued success. At Janus, Gross will work alongside Myron Scholes, the Nobel prize-winning economist best known for devising with Fischer Black the formula by which options are priced \u2013 the Black-Scholes model. He will start employment on Monday and begin managing money from 6 October in a new office in Newport Beach.",

In August its flagship total return fund reported a 16th consecutive month of outflows.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ir.janus.com/file.aspx?IID=4050265&amp;FID=25432118\" title=\"\">In a statement issued by Janus</a>, Gross gave clues to his reasons for leaving Pimco. \u201cI look forward to returning my full focus to the fixed income markets and investing, giving up many of the complexities that go with managing a large, complicated organisation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI chose Janus as my next home because of my long-standing relationship with, and respect for, chief executive officer Dick Weil and my desire to get back to spending the bulk of my day managing client assets.\u201d</p> <p>Gross was also quoted as saying that his decision to quit Pimco \u201cwas not without great thought and deliberation\u201d, wishing his friends and associates at Pimco continued success.</p> <p>At Janus, Gross will work alongside Myron Scholes, the Nobel prize-winning economist best known for devising with Fischer Black the formula by which options are priced \u2013 the Black-Scholes model. He will start employment on Monday and begin managing money from 6 October in a new office in Newport Beach.</p>",

It merely acquired a misleading veneer of resolution thanks to grand promises, political chest-thumping and frazzled financial markets that were desperate to believe in happily ever after. Today, there is an accentuated sense of deja vu (all over again, as Yogi Berra would concur). Europe faces the spectre of deflation. Some members, such as Italy, have toppled over the edge for the first time in more than half a century. Germany threatens recession, and France is a basket case. Wages are in decline across club Med. Real hourly wages in Greece, Spain and Ireland recently fell for the fourth year in succession. Bank lending, meanwhile, is an aspiration and Banco Espirito Santo is an ugly reminder of the iceberg of bad debts lurking. Good Europeans are in decline while populism, nationalism and jingoism are les belles du jour. Enter quantitative easing (QE) as the white knight, as envisaged by the European Central Bank. This is fast becoming a modern-day rain dance. QE is not a cure. It is a shot of morphine that sedates an ailing patient while doctors figure out what to do in the long term. As with most opiates, the patient feels elated and euphoric. Leaving aside \u201cniggles\u201d like the Germans and the moral hazard of whose sovereign bonds to buy, there is no reason why financial markets should not rally if QE proceeds. Our limited sample over the past few years proves this. Asset-price inflation and falling bond yields are, however, poor substitutes for long-run economic growth. They are arguably even antithetical, given the punishing bubbles they risk creating. Europe has a singular problem. It has far too much debt, and in a globalised world much of it is bound in a complex web, particularly among the weaker economies \u2013 namely Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain \u2013 and their main creditors: France, Germany, the UK and the US. Spain holds more than half of Portugal\u2019s foreign debt claims, while Italy owes French banks about $373bn, almost a seventh of France\u2019s GDP. And, lest we forget, Italy also has the third-largest sovereign bond market in the world. This is a game of dominoes. Any solution that does not involve large-scale debt forgiveness is doomed to failure. In the 1920s, the Dawes plan - an ambitious scheme of credit easing to tackle the intractable debts left by the first world war - fuelled an enormous bubble that ended in the great depression, as the underlying reality of sovereign insolvency became clear. It also created a fertile political climate for the nationalism that ended so disastrously more than a decade later. Money is divisive when things turn sour. Here is a solution for Europe that tackles the root cause. Write down the debt \u2013 not piecemeal, as events force you discordantly to that realisation, but rather coordinated and on an ambitious Europe-wide scale. This acknowledges that the system is saturated with debt, much of it bad, and restores the capacity for future economic growth. This is not unprecedented. The Brady bonds are an earlier example that successfully tackled the seemingly intractable Latin American debt crises of the 1980s. Europe needs its own Brady bond plan. Aggregate the debt, reduce principals and coupons, and allow the markets to price it free of political rhetoric and monetary smokescreens. Use QE, but as a salve to facilitate and ease the transition. This allows creditors, public and private, to restructure to their preference while also providing debt forgiveness. It also buys the time needed for elusive structural reform to restore sustainable growth. Challenges remain. All the core countries, notably Germany, must support it if market confidence is to be maintained. Terms and structures will need to be carefully thought out if Argentina-like problems are not to re-emerge. There are few other options on the table. Without large-scale debt forgiveness, nothing will change. Rather, Europe will keep re-enacting the same tragedy of small decisions. Japan may have stoically endured two lost decades, but it is far more homogeneous and united. Europe is not. Regardless of the end, it cannot sustain this journey without risking continued social tensions and an eventual emasculation of the Union. \u2022 Bob Swarup, author of Money Mania: Booms, Panics and Crashes from Ancient Rome to the Great Meltdown (Bloomsbury, 2014), is a London-based investor and fellow of the Institute of Economic Affairs",

      "bodyText": "The fallout from Tesco's profit warning continues, with supermarket shares under pressure again. With markets edging lower again, one of the day's biggest fallers so far is J Sainsbury, down 5.9p at 252.1p after it unveiled price cuts across 12,000 products. The latest shots in the supermarket price war, in the wake of Tesco's travails, have unnerved investors in the sector. Following negative notes from HSBC and Deutsche Bank on Sainsbury ahead of an expected 3% fall in sales when new chief executive Mike Coupe unveils its latest results, Barclays has cut its price target from 365p to 300p but maintained its overweight rating. Meanwhile Morrisons is down 2.1p to 172p while Tesco is down 1p at 191.5p. Sports Direct International, which has taken an \u00a343m punt on Tesco shares recovering, has lost 15.5p to 622p, amid criticism about whether it is a good use of company cash. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 11.66 points to 6628.05, with a combination of concerns. It is on track for its biggest weekly fall since June 2013, on worries about rising interest rates in the UK and US, a spate of profit warnings (Tesco was not alone), and fears of slowing growth in China and the eurozone. On top of that were geopolitical tensions - the repercussions from US air strikes in Syria, Russia retaliating for sanctions prompted by its actions in Ukraine among them. Andy McLevey at Interactive Investor said: Traders in London took their cue from Wall Street and Asia where ongoing geopolitical concerns, a slowdown in China, the end of Fed QE and interest rate fears caused the biggest one-day losses in almost two months.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s former finance director, Laurie McIlwee, is to receive a \u00a31m payoff next week, even though the crisis-hit retailer is embroiled in a \u00a3250m accounting scandal. Although the investigation has only just got under way, McIlwee will be paid the cash as set out in his contract. He quit the business in April and was told to stay away from the office \u2013 a period when it appears the finances of the UK\u2019s largest retailer spun out of control. In McIlwee\u2019s absence the finance team was overseen by then chief executive Philip Clarke, and on Monday the company admitted that profits for the first six months of its financial year were now likely to be \u00a3250m less than previously stated due to suspected mishandling of payments from suppliers. Despite his services not being required, McIlwee was paid more than \u00a3400,000 during a six-month so-called \u201ctransition\u201d period after his resignation. That period ends next Friday. As of that date he ceases to be a Tesco employee and, in line with his contract, is entitled to a \u201ctermination payment\u201d of \u00a3970,800, which takes in a year\u2019s salary of \u00a3886,420 as well as other benefits including private healthcare and a car worth \u00a384,460, according to the company\u2019s annual report. The payment will be made the following month. A Tesco spokesman confirmed that the payment is not being withheld until the investigation is complete and will be as detailed in the annual report. There is no suggestion that McIlwee played any role in the alleged mishandling of payments. Tesco\u2019s shares have lost 15% of their value this week and lost a further 1.2% on Thursday, closing at 192.5p, despite backing from an unusual source: the Sports Direct retail chain run by billionaire Mike Ashley on Thursday outlined a complicated derivatives deal, made with investment bank Goldman Sachs, that is essentially a bet on Tesco\u2019s shares rising. Details of the deal were sketchy but Ashley\u2019s group will have to pay Goldman if the share price falls, and will make a gain if they rise. McIlwee\u2019s departure left a vacuum at the top of the finance department of the world\u2019s third biggest retailer. Tesco has two experienced former finance directors on its board \u2013 Ken Hanna and Mark Armour \u2013 but neither was asked to step into the role in the interim period before McIlwee\u2019s replacement, Alan Stewart, was free to join from Marks &amp; Spencer. Some shareholders questioned whether the decision to leave this key post empty contributed to the error, which wiped \u00a32bn off the company\u2019s market value on the day it was announced. Adrian Bailey MP, chairman of the powerful Commons business select committee, suggested on Thursday that the \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d of directors may have contributed to the crisis. Bailey is considering whether to launch a wider grocery industry inquiry depending on the results of the company\u2019s own investigation. The retailer has defended its handling of the gap between finance directors \u2013 new chief executive Dave Lewis has since managed to negotiate Stewart\u2019s early release from his gardening leave \u2013 stating that a \u201cgroup of senior finance personnel was established to ensure co-ordination and oversight of all financial matters\u201d. That committee helped prepare the guidance, issued along with a profit warning at the end of August, that it expected to make a trading profit of some \u00a31.1bn over the last six months. That figure is now judged to be \u00a3250m too high, possibly as a result of payments from suppliers \u2013 to cover costs like promotions and prime shelf space \u2013 being booked too early. \u201cIt seems unbelievable that a retailing colossus like Tesco should not have a full-time finance director overseeing everything,\u201d said Bailey. The suspected hole in Tesco\u2019s accounts was revealed by Lewis. Acting on information received from a whistleblower, he called in a team of external accountants and lawyers from city firms Deloitte and Freshfields to assess the true financial position. To clear the path for the investigators, Lewis suspended four senior executives, including Chris Bush, who runs Tesco\u2019s domestic supermarket chain. The investigators likely to have questions for Clarke, who remains on the payroll until January when he too is entitled to a payoff of a year\u2019s salary. A supermarket ombudsman was established in 2013 to police the relationship between the big supermarkets and their suppliers but Bailey is concerned the situation at Tesco is a sign that all is not well. \u201cThe Groceries Code Adjudicator was to try and get a fairer balance of power between suppliers and retailers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are being forced to provide income or bonuses to suit the accounting regime of retailers, that is a matter of some concern. We will look at the outcome of the investigation, but if we think it is a whitewash we will have to ask what is going on.\u201d",
