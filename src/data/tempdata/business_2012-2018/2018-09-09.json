      "bodyText": "The John Lewis Partnership made more than 1,800 people redundant in the year to the end of June, nearly three times the level in the previous year, as it cut costs amid a profits slump. The scale of the cutbacks made over the past 12 months emerged in an update to employees in the staff magazine, the Gazette. John Lewis said 1,838 people had been made redundant in the past year, 289% more than in the previous 12 months. The company said it had created new jobs, including hiring 600 staff when it opened its new Westfield store in White City. It also increased its in-house design and buying teams for own-label goods. In total there are now just over 700 fewer employees across the group than a year ago \u2013 taking the total to just over 83,000 staff. The business, which owns a string of department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, is preparing to report on Thursday that it did not make any profit in the first six months of this year, compared to a \u00a326.6m profit last year, as tough trading conditions on the high street take their toll. The company warned of the likely profits fall in June, blaming Brexit-fuelled inflation and the extra costs of investing in IT at a time when it has been forced to cut prices because of widespread discounting by ailing competitors such as House of Fraser. It expects full-year profits to be significantly down. Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed the department-store side of the group planned to cut about 270 more jobs, just as it changed its name to \u201cJohn Lewis &amp; Partners\u201d to highlight ownership by its employees. The Gazette indicated that the number could be higher, as it revealed that 350 staff are being consulted about the changes which affect back-office jobs in IT, finance and store security for its 50 department stores. The group is also cutting costs at its head office, stopping investment in new stores, reviewing its pension arrangements and reining in marketing spending. At the same time, it intends to pump up to \u00a3500m a year into refurbishing its stores and website, as well as developing new products and services. Speaking last week, John Lewis department store boss Paula Nickolds said that despite the job cuts, the company was aiming to improve service in store. \u201cWe are determined to play the long game and our ownership model means we can,\u201d Nickolds said on a tour of John Lewis\u2019s revamped Oxford Street store in London. \u201cWhile others are investing in drones, we are investing in people. Where others are cutting back, we are investing in the very thing that is our point of difference.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Entertainment One, the company behind The Hunger Games and Peppa Pig, is braced for a shareholder revolt this week over its chief executive\u2019s pay packet, for the second year in a row. City advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS are recommending investors vote against the FTSE 250-listed company\u2019s remuneration report at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting in Toronto, where the firm is headquartered. The TV and film production company faced one of the biggest protest votes in the City last year, when Glass Lewis criticised its \u201cpoor response to shareholder dissent\u201d. Entertainment One paid Darren Throop \u00a31.86m for the year to 31 March, up from \u00a31.68m the previous year. His salary rose to \u00a3866,000 from \u00a3823,000, while his annual bonus more than doubled to \u00a3802,000. The chief executive\u2019s salary is set to rise to \u00a3950,000 in 2019 and by 7% a year thereafter. Glass Lewis expressed concern about the \u201csuccessive significant salary increases\u201d awarded to Throop, while ISS is unhappy about the \u00a37.7m special share bonus handed to the chief executive last year, according to reports.. At last year\u2019s meeting, 38.2% of investors voted against the firm\u2019s remuneration report in an advisory vote. It narrowly avoided defeat on its pay policy (the special payout to its CEO), which 47.4% of shareholders opposed. That vote is binding and is held every three years. The group was included in the \u201cname and shame\u201d register of companies ordered by Theresa May of firms rewarding bosses with \u201cfat cat pay\u201d. The company defended its payouts ahead of Thursday\u2019s AGM, arguing that under Throop\u2019s leadership revenues had grown 32%, profit before tax had increased 76% and the dividend had gone up 27% since 2015. It added that it \u201cmust bridge expectations\u201d on pay between the UK, where it is listed, and north America, where most of its executives are based. After talking to nearly 60% of shareholders since last year\u2019s meeting, the firm said it had decided to provide providing fuller disclosure on pay in its 2018 annual report. Entertainment One, chaired by the former Asda boss Allan Leighton, is best known for the hit children\u2019s cartoon Peppa Pig but also distributes shows including The Walking Dead and films such as the Twilight and The Hunger Games series.",

      "bodyText": "It is an argument that has drawn in the likes of Paul McCartney, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and the Vienna Philharmonic, as well as pioneers of the internet from Tim Berners-Lee to the founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales. Fought with hashtags, mailshots, open letters and celebrity endorsements, the battle over the European Union\u2019s draft directive on copyright heads for a showdown this week. After two years of debate, members of the European parliament will vote on Wednesday on the legislation, which could change the balance of power between producers of music, news and film and the dominant websites that host their work. Proposed in 2016 to update copyright law for the age of Facebook and Google, the directive has unleashed a ferocious lobbying war. Lawmakers have been bombarded with millions of emails and thousands of calls, many based on standard scripts written by lobbyists. Some have even received death threats, according to the French MEP Virginie Rozi\u00e8re. Critics claim the proposal will destroy the internet, spelling the end of sharing holiday snaps or memes on Facebook. Proponents are exasperated by such claims, described by German Christian Democrat Axel Voss as \u201ctotally wrong\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d. Amid last-minute writing and rewriting of amendments, the final outcome cannot be predicted. The proposals were rejected by the European parliament in July, despite earlier support in a relevant committee. Among the latest to mobilise in favour were 165 film-makers and screenwriters, including the British director Mike Leigh, who launched an appeal at the Venice film festival last week calling on EU lawmakers to pass the law. In July McCartney pressed MEPs to stop tech firms exploiting musicians. Europe\u2019s biggest news agencies have also urged MEPs to vote for the law, as they accused Google and Facebook of \u201cplundering\u201d the news and their ad revenues, resulting in a \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d. \u201cFor the sake of Europe\u2019s free press and democratic values, EU lawmakers should press ahead with copyright reform,\u201d said a statement signed by 20 agencies, including the Press Association and Agence France-Presse. Opponents are no less forceful. Wikipedia shut down its pages in some countries in protest at the plans, which it claims would force the closure of its user-generated encyclopaedia. Berners-Lee is among 70 internet luminaries to oppose the law, arguing it would be transform the internet from an open platform into a tool for \u201cautomated surveillance and control\u201d. The UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, has raised concerns about \u201cprepublication censorship\u201d. One of the most hotly disputed sections is article 11, which would require internet companies to pay newspapers, magazines and agencies for posting \u201csnippets\u201d of their work \u2013 for example, the headline, picture and text bundles on Facebook feeds and Google News. The other contested point is article 13, which would make platforms such as YouTube liable for copyrighted material, requiring them to have agreements with rights holders of music and film. The music industry argues the rise of the internet giants has created a \u201cvalue gap\u201d that harms people trying to break into the business. YouTube pays music companies 20 times less than a \u201cfairly licensed service\u201d such as Spotify, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. It says the penalty on artists is magnified because YouTube is so dominant, with 1.8bn users a month. \u201cThat is fundamentally unfair,\u201d said Dave Rowntree, the drummer in Blur, on a recent visit to Brussels to meet European lawmakers. \u201cYouTube have rather cleverly found a niche for themselves where they can have their cake and eat it. They can use clever artificial intelligence software to see what the user is doing \u2026 yet when it comes to having to pay out a fair share they say \u2018no \u2026 we just provide a website\u2019.\u201d Rowntree rejected the suggestion that only record labels and established artists would benefit from the directive. \u201cIt makes little difference to me. I am not here to argue for more royalties for me. I\u2019m doing fine, most of my money is made out of radio play and touring and we are not a huge YouTube band \u2026 it is a big impediment to young, up-and-coming bands.\u201d Internet platforms, increasingly known in Brussels as \u201cGafa\u201d (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon), insist they are not opposed to copyright reform, but contend that the plans on the drawing board will destroy the internet by requiring them to have censorship filters to check for copyright violations. \u201cThe only way to scan the platform continually is to have automated filters in place. There is no other way to do it,\u201d said Siada El Ramly, director general of EDiMA, a Brussels group representing Facebook, Google and other internet platforms. She said filters \u201cwon\u2019t be able to discriminate whether it is a commercial business or an individual putting the content up \u2026 it is not infallible and mistakes will be made.\u201d The industry also objects to the cost of having to create filters. YouTube had already spent $60m (\u00a346m) on a content identification system, said El Ramly. \u201cIt is a very big cost to take on board, and it is not a one-off \u2013 it is something that needs to be maintained.\u201d Massive costs? Impossible demands? Voss, who is in charge of the file in the European parliament, said he had heard this story before. \u201cWe have had this with the banks, we have had this with the telecoms [industry] and now with the internet giants: that regulation done by the EU regulator will lead to something catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not end the internet.\u201d",

YouTube pays music companies 20 times less than a \u201cfairly licensed service\u201d such as Spotify, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. It says the penalty on artists is magnified because YouTube is so dominant, with 1.8bn users a month.</p> <p>\u201cThat is fundamentally unfair,\u201d said Dave Rowntree, the drummer in Blur, on a recent visit to Brussels to meet European lawmakers. \u201cYouTube have rather cleverly found a niche for themselves where they can have their cake and eat it. They can use clever artificial intelligence software to see what the user is doing \u2026 yet when it comes to having to pay out a fair share they say \u2018no \u2026 we just provide a website\u2019.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/02/big-techs-double-trouble-bipartisan-criticism-may-signal-a-reckoning-ahead\">Big tech's double trouble: political heat from Trump and the left may signal reckoning ahead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rowntree rejected the suggestion that only record labels and established artists would benefit from the directive. \u201cIt makes little difference to me.

There is no other way to do it,\u201d said Siada El Ramly, director general of EDiMA, a Brussels group representing Facebook, Google and other internet platforms. She said filters \u201cwon\u2019t be able to discriminate whether it is a commercial business or an individual putting the content up \u2026 it is not infallible and mistakes will be made.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The industry also objects to the cost of having to create filters.

      "bodyText": "The disgraced media and publishing tycoon, Robert Maxwell, was due to meet the Bank of England on the day his body was found floating in the Atlantic after he went missing off his private yacht, his sons have revealed. Kevin Maxwell, 59, said he and his father had a shouting match on the telephone the night Maxwell died, over a meeting planned the following day with the then deputy governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George. The Mirror Group owner was still on his boat in the Canaries and refusing to return to London from his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine. \u201cWe needed to prepare for that meeting and I was a bit hacked off that he was going to leave it to the last minute,\u201d Kevin told the Sunday Times. He said he did not call his father first thing because he was angry, but finally contacted the captain at 10am to be told Maxwell, 68, was missing. \u201cI said \u2018Where are you?\u2019 and he said, \u2018We are cruising\u2019 and then [I] understood that he [Maxwell] must be overboard,\u201d said Kevin. The inquest into Maxwell\u2019s death ruled that he died from a heart attack combined with accidental drowning, but it has been the subject of endless conspiracy theories since. The news of the planned Bank of England meeting highlights that in the days before his death in November 1991, Maxwell, a former Labour MP, was facing mounting pressure over the financial position of his companies, Maxwell Communications Corporation (MCC) and Mirror Group holdings. Maxwell had taken two loans from the bank Goldman Sachs, one for \u00a320m and one for \u00a330m, and had failed to repay them, the Sunday Times reported. George had been informed the bank was to start selling Mirror Group and MCC shares it held as collateral, and Maxwell had been summoned. The news of the shares sale broke on 5 November, just hours before Maxwell\u2019s naked body was found. Maxwell\u2019s son Ian, 62, told the newspaper: \u201cIn 27 years I\u2019ve never speculated: was he killed or did he kill himself? If I say anything about it, I think it is highly unlikely that he would have taken his own life, it wasn\u2019t in his makeup or mentality. I don\u2019t think any murder conspiracy stands up, so for me, it is an unexplained accident and I\u2019m content to live with that.\u201d After Maxwell\u2019s death, around \u00a3460m was found to be missing from the pensions funds of his companies. Kevin and Ian Maxwell were acquitted in 1996 of fraud charges arising from their roles in their father\u2019s companies. Kevin became Britain\u2019s biggest bankrupt to the tune of more than \u00a3400m in the wake of the unprecedented pension fund scandal. The two brothers, who have spent the past 30 years pursuing business ventures outside the UK, this week launched an initiative, Combating Jihadist Terrorism in the UK, a thinktank aimed at better understanding terrorism and its causes.",

      "bodyText": "Historians have recorded turning points for time immemorial. The crossing of the Rubicon by Caesar, the Boston Tea Party for the United States, Britain\u2019s triumph at Waterloo and decline after Suez. For the chroniclers of capitalism, the collapse of Lehman Brothers a decade ago this week stands as the major tipping point in modern financial history. The talk in the City will be of the days before Lehman and those after. A new economic era dawned for Britain and much of the wealthy world when the American investment bank became the biggest company to file for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008 with more than $600bn (\u00a3464bn) in assets \u2013 about $2,000 for every man woman and child in the US at the time. It triggered the largest economic shock since the Great Depression and is known now as the Great Recession. UK real GDP fell sharply in 2009 and did not return to its pre-crisis level until 2013. Business investment experienced a sharp downturn in 2009 and took until 2015 to recover its 2007-peak. A decade on, productivity growth has stalled and household debt has hit dangerous levels amid government austerity we were told was necessary to atone for the recklessness of the City. When Lehman went bust, the idea that governments should rescue failing companies was still anathema to George Bush. Yet politicians around the world quickly realised the domino effect from its collapse could not be ignored. The banking system and its biggest titans were too big to fail. Their losses had to be socialised to prevent havoc to living standards, despite decades of vast profits flowing into private hands. Consumers would lose access to their banks accounts and businesses wouldn\u2019t be able to borrow if action wasn\u2019t taken. In the aftermath, the politicians and bankers, like guilty children seeking penance, promised this would never happen again \u2013 the time for \u201cending too big to fail\u201d had come. That is the big story of the past decade in finance. Much progress has been made. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, argues capital requirements for banks have increased 10-fold in a decade, while trumpeting their ability to pass stress tests simulating a financial apocalypse worse than 2008. Even the harshest of Brexit wouldn\u2019t prevent them operating, he says. The poster child of the crisis in Britain, RBS, has increased the proportion of its funding kept aside to protect against potential losses from 2% before its taxpayer-funded bailout, to around 16% today. The industry has been forced to ringfence riskier investment banking away from day-to-day retail banking and draw up so-called living wills plotting how they would fail safely. Yet the costs of failure will always remain too great. Like Sisyphus condemned to push an immense rock up a hill for eternity, the job can never be finished. Warren Buffett, perhaps the world\u2019s most famous investor, knows no major bank would ever be allowed to fail. The banks carry an implicit government guarantee, making them among the safest investments around. Despite a decade trying to remove taxpayers from the hook, the power of the industry remains more concentrated than ever with four major players. Share sales have begun, but RBS is still majority owned by the state. The former CEO Fred Goodwin was due about \u00a3350,000 a year from his RBS pension when he rode off into the sunset leaving a charred wreck behind him. That\u2019s around \u00a33m since 2009, from a bank still essentially a ward of state. Not a single bank chief or chairman went to prison here or in the US. The moral hazard of reward for failure remains. The gleaming towers of Canary Wharf or the City might be potent symbols of free-market capitalism, but they are state sponsored. The financial system is a perversely socialist endeavour. It is the ultimate welfare recipient. Support for the banks during the 2008 crash hit a peak of almost a trillion pounds to save the banks from collapse. And the money is still flowing a decade after Lehman. George Osborne\u2019s help-to-buy scheme helps prop-up the mortgage industry, with around \u00a39bn of equity loans helping support a wider market worth about \u00a31.4tn. With the Tories in power, selling mortgages can only be a winning bet. The term funding scheme gave \u00a3127bn in cheap borrowing to the banks with the proviso they kept lending following the Brexit vote two years ago. The financial services compensation scheme guarantees the deposits of every individual customer of a UK bank up to \u00a385,000. Meanwhile banks have become more reliant on our cash since the crash, with about 87% of funds drawn from depositors. The New Economics Foundation reckons the industry receives about \u00a323bn from its ability to create loans and receive income, in another hidden subsidy. For all of this arm\u2019s-length support we have relatively little say in how the banks are run and how our money should be used. There are plenty of options. Competition could be improved to reduce the impact one bank would have on the economy from going bust. The big four could be forcibly split or more support provided to challengers. Labour proposes turning RBS into a network of local banks and the idea has merit. Alongside setting interest rates and overseeing bank stability, Threadneedle Street could issue credit guidance rules, steering bank lending towards greater levels of productive investment in the economy. Politicians could have greater say over when bank branches are closed down, or on the cost of credit for the neediest customers, who are routinely ripped-off by high-cost providers. A national investment bank might be useful, as proposed by the IPPR commission on economic justice. While public institutions can fail in the same way as the private sector, there is more accountability and evidence from around the world that they can also succeed. Christine Lagarde warned last week the banking industry was \u201csafer, but not safe enough\u201d 10 years after Lehman, as the industry pushes back against the rules introduced since the crisis. Brexiters want fewer rules for the City, while Donald Trump has pledged to unpick some of the key post-crisis reforms in America. That must never be allowed. Greater action from the state is required, not less. Otherwise, the world could be reaching a tipping point once more in the post-Lehman age.",

Business investment experienced a sharp downturn in 2009 and took until 2015 to recover its 2007-peak.</p> <p>A decade on, productivity growth has stalled and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/06/personal-debts-shear-almost-900m-off-british-economy\">household debt has hit dangerous levels</a> amid government austerity we were told was necessary to atone for the recklessness of the City.</p> <p>When Lehman went bust, the idea that governments should rescue failing companies was still anathema to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-bush\">George Bush</a>. Yet politicians around the world quickly realised the domino effect from its collapse could not be ignored.</p> <p>The banking system and its biggest titans were too big to fail. Their losses had to be socialised to prevent havoc to living standards, despite decades of vast profits flowing into private hands. Consumers would lose access to their banks accounts and businesses wouldn\u2019t be able to borrow if action wasn\u2019t taken.</p> <p>In the aftermath, the politicians and bankers, like guilty children seeking penance, promised this would never happen again \u2013 the time for <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/article/2016/ending-too-big-to-fail-how-best-to-deal-with-failed-large-banks\">\u201cending too big to fail\u201d</a> had come. That is the big story of the past decade in finance.</p> <p>Much progress has been made. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney\">Mark Carney</a>, the Bank of England governor, argues capital requirements for banks have <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2018/new-economy-new-finance-new-bank-speech-by-mark-carney.pdf\">increased </a><a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2018/new-economy-new-finance-new-bank-speech-by-mark-carney.pdf\">10-fold in a decade</a>, while trumpeting their ability to pass stress tests simulating a financial apocalypse worse than 2008. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/nov/28/bank-of-england-stress-tests-financial-stability-released-live\">Even the harshest of Brexit</a> wouldn\u2019t prevent them operating, he says.</p> <p>The poster child of the crisis in Britain, RBS, has increased the proportion of its funding kept aside to protect against potential losses from 2% before its taxpayer-funded bailout, to around 16% today. The industry has been forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/12/vickers-report-banks-given-until-2019\">ringfence riskier investment banking</a> away from day-to-day retail banking and draw up so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/22/financial-services-authority-living-wills-banks\">living wills</a> plotting how they would fail safely.</p> <p>Yet the costs of failure will always remain too great. Like Sisyphus condemned to push an immense rock up a hill for eternity, the job can never be finished.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/warrenbuffett\">Warren Buffett</a>, perhaps the world\u2019s most famous investor, knows no major bank would ever <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/warren-buffett-too-big-to-fail_n_821814\">be allowed to fail</a>. The banks carry an implicit government guarantee, making them among the safest investments around.</p> <p>Despite a decade trying to remove taxpayers from the hook, the power of the industry remains more concentrated than ever with four major players. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/05/hammond-forced-to-defend-rbs-shares-sale\">Share sales have begun</a>, but RBS is still majority owned by the state.</p> <p>The former CEO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/18/sir-fred-goodwin-royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Fred Goodwin</a> was due about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/18/rbs-sir-fred-goodwin-pension\">\u00a3350,000 a year from his RBS pension</a> when he rode off into the sunset leaving a charred wreck behind him. That\u2019s around \u00a33m since 2009, from a bank still essentially a ward of state. Not a single bank chief or chairman went to prison here or in the US. The moral hazard of reward for failure remains.</p> <p>The gleaming towers of Canary Wharf or the City might be potent symbols of free-market capitalism, but they are state sponsored. The financial system is a perversely socialist endeavour. It is the ultimate welfare recipient.</p> <p>Support for the banks during the 2008 crash <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/maintaining-the-financial-stability-of-uk-banks-update-on-the-support-schemes/\">hit a peak of almost a trillion pounds</a> to save the banks from collapse. And the money is still flowing a decade after Lehman.</p> <p>George Osborne\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/help-to-buy-scheme\">help-to-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/help-to-buy-scheme\">buy scheme</a> helps prop-up the mortgage industry, with around \u00a39bn of equity loans helping support a wider market worth about \u00a31.4tn. With the Tories in power, selling mortgages can only be a winning bet.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">term </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">funding </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">scheme</a> gave \u00a3127bn in cheap borrowing to the banks with the proviso they kept lending following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote two years ago.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/fscs\">financial </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/fscs\">services </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/fscs\">compensation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/fscs\">scheme</a> guarantees the deposits of every individual customer of a UK bank up to \u00a385,000. Meanwhile banks have become more reliant on our cash since the crash, with about 87% of funds drawn from depositors.</p> <p>The New Economics Foundation reckons the industry receives about \u00a323bn from its ability to <a href=\"https://neweconomics.org/2017/01/exposed-banks-23bn-hidden-subsidy\">create loans and receive income</a>, in another hidden subsidy.</p> <p>For all of this arm\u2019s-length support we have relatively little say in how the banks are run and how our money should be used. </p> <p>There are plenty of options. Competition could be improved to reduce the impact one bank would have on the economy from going bust. The big four could be forcibly split or more support provided to challengers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jun/19/john-mcdonnells-ambition-is-fine-but-he-needs-to-avoid-statism\">Labour proposes turning RBS</a> into a network of local banks and the idea has merit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside setting interest rates and overseeing bank stability, Threadneedle Street could issue credit guidance rules, steering bank lending towards greater levels of productive investment in the economy.</p> <p>Politicians could have greater say over when bank branches are closed down, or on the cost of credit for the neediest customers, who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/sep/02/wonga-ethical-lenders-borrowers-michael-sheen-debt\">routinely ripped-off</a> by high-cost providers.</p> <p>A national investment bank might be useful, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/05/thinktank-calls-for-major-overhaul-of-britains-economy\">as proposed by the IPPR </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/05/thinktank-calls-for-major-overhaul-of-britains-economy\">commission on </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/05/thinktank-calls-for-major-overhaul-of-britains-economy\">economic </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/05/thinktank-calls-for-major-overhaul-of-britains-economy\">justice</a>.

      "bodyText": "When the Bank of England was celebrating the 20th anniversary of becoming independent last year, I was asked whether I agreed that, notwithstanding my initial doubts, independence had proved a success. I replied that it was too early to tell. This was an echo of a widely misunderstood quotation from the Chinese prime minister Zhou Enlai, who, when President Nixon asked him what he thought of the impact of the French Revolution, reportedly replied: \u201cIt is too early to tell.\u201d Since the French revolution took place in 1789, this was considered rather a good joke, and is often referred to. I came across it again in the conclusion to my fellow journalist Tim Shipman\u2019s book on the way the Conservative party landed us with the EU referendum. Shipman uses it to illustrate his belief that it could be a very long time before one can judge the rights and wrongs of Brexit. Well, although I think he can hardly be faulted for his research, I could hardly disagree more with his conclusion. At this point, it should be noted that a state department official who was with Nixon on that visit tried to set the record straight. He pointed out that Zhou, student of French history though he was, had in fact been referring to a more recent event: namely the Paris riots of 1968, and their repercussions. My own view is that the economic, social and diplomatic damage caused by the referendum is all too apparent already. The terrible thing is the way so many people still assume that Brexit will have to happen, notwithstanding the way that the polls are moving in a favourable direction \u2013 59% Remain, 41% Leave was the latest I saw last week. Yet at a degree ceremony last week, a senior London University academic blithely stated \u201cas we move inexorably towards leaving the European Union \u2026\u201d This was after there had been a parade of alumni on screen, including a picture of the Daily Telegraph\u2019s \u201ccommissioning editor for Brexit\u201d. Your correspondent suppressed his desire to heckle \u2013 one must be on one\u2019s best behaviour when one\u2019s daughter is receiving a degree \u2013 but then thought: \u201cHang on a minute. The Brexit commissioning editor of the Telegraph cannot be all bad.\u201d Why? Because my mind went back to a recent article in the Telegraph. Yes, the paper in which the egregious Boris Johnson sounds off actually gave space to Julien Gaer, the distinguished consultant cardiac surgeon at the Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospital, to explain what the prospect of Brexit is already doing to the NHS. As anyone who has had occasion to have hospital treatment \u2013 in other words, most of us \u2013 knows, the NHS is on life support with the aid of foreign nationals and \u201cfree movement\u201d. But Gaer reports that the government\u2019s \u201creassurances\u201d to NHS workers from overseas are not enough. Colleagues of his feel unwanted: \u201cThe environment in the country as a whole has become so toxic that they may simply up sticks and go somewhere they are appreciated.\u201d Now, the main reason why there is growing dissatisfaction is the manifest incompetence of the preparations for Brexit. But the real reason should be acknowledgement that Brexit would be a nonsense anyway. When that eccentric Brexiter Mervyn King complains about the state of play, you can be sure that he and other Leavers are getting their excuses in first. Which brings us to King\u2019s successor as governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who has been asked to stay on beyond June 2019 in an attempt to bring continuity and stability to a crazy prospect. There has recently been much criticism of the governor\u2019s supposed inconsistency about his tenure. But when commentators complain that he wanted first a five-year term, then a six and now a seven, instead of the \u201cnormal eight\u201d, they need to consult the history books. There never was a \u201cnormal eight\u201d. There was a normal five, normally renewable. Thus Gordon Richardson was governor 1973-83, Robin Leigh-Pemberton 1983-93, Eddie George 1993-2003 and King 2003-13. George Osborne, by offering Carney an eight-year term, wished to end the usual speculation about whether or not a five-year term would be renewed. Instead we have ended up with more speculation than ever about Carney, who keeps being accused of changing his mind. However, while welcoming any extension of his lease, I hope that the governor will not be needed to steer us through Brexit; the national interest requires that the entire non-plan should be abandoned. Then Carney can be forgiven if he changes his mind again. As for the success of Bank independence, it is still too early to tell.",
