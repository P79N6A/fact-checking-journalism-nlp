    "webTitle": "Royal Mail says postal deliveries to remote areas under threat", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Mail has warned that postal deliveries to rural areas are under threat because rivals are being allowed to cherry pick easy and profitable deliveries in towns and cities without having to run services to isolated homes such as on Scottish islands. After the furore over its sell-off last year, which sparked accusations the soaring share price at the float had effectively lost the taxpayer \u00a3750m in a day, the company issued its warning on Thursday over the universal service obligation as it reported a 12% rise in operating profits to \u00a3671m. Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, said rival TNT Post UK's ability to pick off profitable routes in big cities was \"striking at the economics of the universal service obligation\" \u2013 its statutory duty to deliver to every address in the country, six days a week, at the same price. TNT Post UK has launched \"final mile\" delivery services in London, Manchester and Liverpool, and plans to deliver to up to 42% of addresses by 2017. Greene said Royal Mail subsidised expensive deliveries to rural areas from the profits it made from services in big cities, and any increased threat from rivals could cost it \u00a3200m in revenues by 2017. \"TNT Post UK can cherry pick easy-to-serve urban areas, delivering easy-to-handle post to homes less frequently than Royal Mail and to no defined quality standard,\" she said. \"Royal Mail is required to deliver six days a week, overnight, throughout the whole country, to stringent quality standards and at a uniform, affordable tariff. \"Everyone should really sit up and take notice of what effect this cherry picking will have.\" Greene called for \"timely regulatory action\" from the regulator Ofcom to prevent undercutting from rivals threatening the universal service. The boss of TNT Post UK, Nick Wells, said Royal Mail should stop \"whingeing\". He insisted his firm's competition posed \"absolutely no threat to the universal service\". \"We are delivering choice for our customers, and that is good for the market overall, as well as creating jobs,\" he said. \"The regulator has repeatedly said there is no threat to the universal service. Royal Mail should stop this sabre-rattling. We have a small market share, there is absolutely no threat to the universal service.\" An Ofcom spokesman said: \"We do not believe that there is presently a threat to the financial sustainability of the universal postal service. \"We would expect Royal Mail to take appropriate steps to respond to the challenge posed by competition, including improving efficiency.\" The regulator said it had a \"duty to secure\" the universal service and \"powers to step in to protect it\" if it came under threat. Ofcom is to review the universal service next year but is unlikely to recommend any changes. Royal Mail is committed to maintaining the universal service until at least 2021, and any change beforehand would have to be put to a vote in parliament. Canada Post, where Greene was chief executive until she joined Royal Mail in 2010, earlier this year announced plans to phase out some door-to-door deliveries. Royal Mail's strong profits \u2013 \u00a3671m before transformation costs on revenue up 2% to \u00a39.46bn \u2013 reignited anger over the government's controversial flotation of the 500-year-old postal operator last October. The shares, which floated at 330p, spiked 38% on their debut on the stock market on 11 October. It was the biggest one-day rise in a privatisation since British Airways in 1987 and the shares went on to reach 618p. On Thursday they dropped 10% to 519p after the warning over the threat from competition. Responding to the profit figures, Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"Ministers' case for their Royal Mail fire sale has now been completely demolished. We know Royal Mail was profitable in the public sector, but David Cameron's government privatised Royal Mail's profits after making the taxpayer pick up the tab for its historic debts. \"Taxpayers have been left short-changed by hundreds of millions of pounds at a time when families are being hit by a cost-of-living crisis, while the City investors the Tory-led government prioritised giving Royal Mail shares have been laughing all the way to the bank.\" Brian Scott of the Unite union, which represents 7,000 Royal Mail managers, said the strong financial results showed taxpayers had been \"fleeced\". \"Instead of these profits flowing into the Treasury's coffers to pay for schools and nurses, it's flowing into the pockets of shareholders, some of which enjoyed 'mates rates' when Royal Mail was sold off on the cheap,\" he said. Royal Mail's revenue from letters dropped 2% to \u00a34.63bn last year, but parcels increased 7% and now make up 51% of overall earnings due to the continued rise of internet shopping. However, Greene warned that Amazon's creation of its own delivery service was knocking sales. She said Amazon's delivery arm was capable of delivering 60m-70m parcels a day, compared with the 75m for Royal Mail's ParcelForce arm. Royal Mail hopes to counter intense competition by making the company more customer friendly. It is opening 100 of its delivery offices on Sundays and will pilot Sunday deliveries within the M25 over the summer. It is also making it easier for customers to track parcels returned to the seller.",

      "body": "<p>The fast-growing property website Zoopla and the Liverpool-based bargain retailer B&amp;M became the latest companies to announce stock market flotations on Thursday as a wave of businesses attempt to tap into investor appetite for new shares.</p> <p>Zoopla, which is based in London and launched only six years ago, is seeking a valuation of about \u00a31bn by selling at least a quarter of the business, with all the money going to existing shareholders \u2013 including Daily Mail and General Trust which owns 52%.</p> <p>B&amp;M, founded in Blackpool in 1978, wants to raise \u00a375m to repay debt and for investment and is hoping for a stock market value of about \u00a32.5bn, which would put it narrowly outside the FTSE 100.</p> <p>The chain, which sells discounted goods from 370 stores mainly in the north of England and the Midlands, is 40% owned by the Arora brothers, who bought it in 2004. The rest is in the hands of the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice.</p> <p>Both companies are trying to convince investors they can grow strongly by capitalising on entrenched consumer trends.</p> <p>Zoopla is floating amid a resurgent property market and with investors keen to snap up the next generation of internet businesses as people conduct more and more of their lives online. Its sites get more than 40m visits each month and revenue, mainly from estate agent advertising fees, rose 26% in the six months to the end of March.</p> <p>B&amp;M, chaired by the former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy, promises investors a slice of the discount store action that has seen supermarkets and other retailers squeezed by Aldi, Lidl, Poundland and Primark.</p> <p>Revenue in the year to March rose 28% to \u00a31.27bn and the chief executive, Simon Arora, said there is scope for the chain to open 400 more UK shops in the next 10 years.</p> <p>With the economy recovering and stock markets booming, IPO fever has taken hold this year. The Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air and the investment and advisory group River and Mercantile also announced flotation plans on Thursday, while the retailer Game announced a float earlier this week.</p> <p>But investors have become more cautious after shares in Appliances Online, Card Factory and Pets at Home have all fallen below their recent offer prices.</p> <p>Zoopla is asking investors to buy its shares just as fears grow that Britain is in another housing bubble, with the Bank of England signalling it is ready to intervene to cool the market.</p> <p>Alex Chesterman, Zoopla's founder and chief executive, said potential investors were unconcerned about the property market overheating.</p> <p>\"The reason we are doing this process is that there is a great level of interest and excitement about our business which is a well-understood business model.

      "bodyText": "The fast-growing property website Zoopla and the Liverpool-based bargain retailer B&amp;M became the latest companies to announce stock market flotations on Thursday as a wave of businesses attempt to tap into investor appetite for new shares. Zoopla, which is based in London and launched only six years ago, is seeking a valuation of about \u00a31bn by selling at least a quarter of the business, with all the money going to existing shareholders \u2013 including Daily Mail and General Trust which owns 52%. B&amp;M, founded in Blackpool in 1978, wants to raise \u00a375m to repay debt and for investment and is hoping for a stock market value of about \u00a32.5bn, which would put it narrowly outside the FTSE 100. The chain, which sells discounted goods from 370 stores mainly in the north of England and the Midlands, is 40% owned by the Arora brothers, who bought it in 2004. The rest is in the hands of the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. Both companies are trying to convince investors they can grow strongly by capitalising on entrenched consumer trends. Zoopla is floating amid a resurgent property market and with investors keen to snap up the next generation of internet businesses as people conduct more and more of their lives online. Its sites get more than 40m visits each month and revenue, mainly from estate agent advertising fees, rose 26% in the six months to the end of March. B&amp;M, chaired by the former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy, promises investors a slice of the discount store action that has seen supermarkets and other retailers squeezed by Aldi, Lidl, Poundland and Primark. Revenue in the year to March rose 28% to \u00a31.27bn and the chief executive, Simon Arora, said there is scope for the chain to open 400 more UK shops in the next 10 years. With the economy recovering and stock markets booming, IPO fever has taken hold this year. The Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air and the investment and advisory group River and Mercantile also announced flotation plans on Thursday, while the retailer Game announced a float earlier this week. But investors have become more cautious after shares in Appliances Online, Card Factory and Pets at Home have all fallen below their recent offer prices. Zoopla is asking investors to buy its shares just as fears grow that Britain is in another housing bubble, with the Bank of England signalling it is ready to intervene to cool the market. Alex Chesterman, Zoopla's founder and chief executive, said potential investors were unconcerned about the property market overheating. \"The reason we are doing this process is that there is a great level of interest and excitement about our business which is a well-understood business model. It is high growth, high visibility, high margin and very cash generative. \"I think the questions around the property market and talk of a bubble are unfounded and premature. The market has seen a strong recovery over the last 12 months but by no means has it fully recovered and we see continued recovery over the next three years.\" Chesterman, whose stake in Zoopla could be valued at about \u00a385m, made his first millions by building up LoveFilm before it was sold to Amazon. He launched Zoopla just as the financial crisis sent property prices tumbling. He said the housing market's recovery in the last year had begun to unleash five years of pent-up demand that saw 3m fewer sales in total than the UK norm. \"We launched at the beginning of 2008 so there were some hairy moments but we had very supportive investors and we have proved we can build an extremely exciting business in challenging times. \"A housing crash like we saw in 2008 and 2009 wouldn't be helpful but we have shown our business has been built during those difficult times.\" B&amp;M's slogan is \"big brands, big savings\". It sells electrical items, furniture, garden equipment and other household goods as well as food. Arora, who bought the chain with his brother Bobby, said the same \"structural shift\" that had spurred the rise of bargain hunting for food and clothes was taking hold in household merchandise. \"Everyone loves a bargain,\" he said. \"All you need to believe is that the people of Southampton are the same as the people of Northampton. We have four successful stores in Northampton and I am entirely confident that the people of Southampton will respond to B&amp;M when it opens there in exactly the same way. \"If you're a stock market investor, you can't buy shares in Aldi and Lidl because they are private. In the UK, where there is so much more growth to come, it has to be B&amp;M.\"",

Now she's grumbling about regulators generating headwinds that could blow her ambitions for Royal Mail wildly off course. The key line in Royal Mail's first set of full-year results as a public company was: \"Without timely regulatory action, direct delivery could undermine the economics of the universal service and our ability to generate sustainably a 5%-10% ebit [earnings before interest and tax] margin in our reported businesses.\" In other words, the arrival of TNT Post, which has placed its own delivery staff on the streets of London, Liverpool and Manchester, represents wasteful competition. The argument is that the newcomer is cherry-picking the most lucrative parts of the postal market, leaving poor old Royal Mail to cover the hills, dales, highlands and islands where the economics are poorer if prices must be nationally uniform. What's more, Royal Mail's staff are still obliged to wheel their (presumably lighter) trolleys around London, Liverpool and Manchester. The usual special pleading or a legitimate worry? It's the latter. Greene's analysis seems broadly correct. Having competing sets of delivery staff on the same patches seems more likely to generate economic waste than beneficial competition. In any case, competition is no longer meant to be the primary regulatory goal. The number one aim is sustaining the universal service. Some degree of competitive heat is clearly required within that framework to prod Royal Mail to keep modernising and to keep it honest. But if TNT is serious about operating end-to-end deliveries to 42% of the population (but only 8% of the geography) by 2017, we're not talking about pinching a few cherries, but several orchards. Regulator Ofcom ought to take a look urgently, as Greene urges. Its current stance \u2013 that it sees no present threat to the universal service \u2013 may be dangerously complacent. Quite how, in practice, the regulator could design ringfences around end-to-end deliveries is another matter. But the current arrangements look a mess. None of which alters the fact that Royal Mail was privatised too cheaply \u2013 the starting dividend yield was 6.1% \u2013 and Greene's warning does not (at least, not yet) imperil the prospect of higher dividends to come. Thus the share price, despite yesterday's 10% fall, is still 57% above the float price, which probably won't help Greene's lobbying efforts. Ofcom's job, however, is not to look at share prices, but to implement sensible policy. For the sake of consumers, as opposed to Royal Mail's shareholders (who can look after themselves), the regulator should address Greene's arguments in detail \u2013 and soon.",

    "webTitle": "AstraZeneca's biggest shareholder calls for new talks on Pfizer takeover", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca's biggest shareholder has called on the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker to hold fresh talks with its US rival Pfizer after the current offer period expires. Pressure is growing on AstraZeneca to resurrect talks in three months' time, while hopes are fading fast that a \u00a369bn deal to create the world's largest drugmaker will be agreed by next Monday's 5pm deadline. AstraZeneca shares in London closed 145p lower at \u00a342.75, a fall of 3.3%. BlackRock, the world's largest asset management group, is understood to be backing AstraZeneca's board over its refusal to recommend Pfizer's \u00a355 a share offer on Monday. But it wants directors to get back to the negotiating table as soon as takeover rules allow. BlackRock, which is also a big investor in Pfizer, increased its stake in AstraZeneca on Tuesday to 8.02% from 7.8%. AstraZeneca is also facing calls from investors to link the bonuses of its top management team to the offer price and the sales targets it has set out as a key plank of its campaign to stay independent. A leading City fund manager, Richard Buxton, the head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, said this would be a way to ensure that directors' pay was linked to the potential losses for shareholders. The AstraZeneca board's rejection of what Pfizer called a final offer prompted a split among investors as to whether talks should be reopened now or whether the management was right to refuse to accept the price. The rejection triggered a 11% fall in AstraZeneca's share price on Monday. Pfizer cannot raise its final proposal, and AstraZeneca directors are unlikely to change their minds before next Monday's deadline. However, under UK takeover rules Pfizer could come back with a new offer at the invitation of the AstraZeneca board in late August, and make an unsolicited bid in late November, after six months have elapsed. AstraZeneca's chairman, Leif Johansson, has said that the board would consider an offer at \u00a358.85 a share. The bookmaker Ladbrokes is offering odds of 3/1 for the takeover to be completed before Monday, and 5/4 for a deal to happen after they walk away, in a new offer period. One big shareholder said there is a reasonable chance a deal will get done later this year. AstraZeneca's second-largest shareholder, Vanguard, is a \"passive\" investor that holds a 4.74% stake through index funds that it manages. Legal &amp; General, the sixth-largest investor with a 3.4% holding, has reportedly written to AstraZeneca to ask it to reconsider its rejection of Pfizer's offer, and Axa Investment Managers, the UK arm of the French insurance group, said the company \"acted too hastily\". This means shareholders representing 16% of AstraZeneca shares, including BlackRock, want new talks with Pfizer. However, a number of other big investors, who together control more than 10% of the shares, have backed the approach of AstraZeneca's management. They include the fourth-largest shareholder, Sweden's Investor AB, which has a 4.1% stake and a seat on the board, along with Threadneedle Asset Management, Fidelity, M&amp;G and Aberdeen Asset Management and Neil Woodford, the veteran City investor who controls a \u00a3350m stake on behalf of St James's Place. Buxton wrote in a letter to the Financial Times: \"A way to reassure investors that the board is convinced of the long-term value of its business is through alignment of interest. \"If the remuneration committee of AstraZeneca \u2013 and indeed any company rejecting an offer in favour of long-term independence \u2013 was to recalibrate any current and future incentives to vest only at the level of the spurned offer, it would provide comfort to shareholders that if things do not play out as the management envisage, the executives have shared in the pain felt by shareholders at the lost opportunity.\" Robert Talbut, the chief investment officer of Royal London Asset Management, which holds just under 1% of AstraZeneca, said: \"It is only fair and reasonable that if the management are so confident that they will be able to hit their targets that their remuneration should be linked to that.\" AstraZeneca said this was a matter for the remuneration committee, which is chaired by the former Barclays boss John Varley. A spokeswoman noted that \"there are clear targets for long-term incentives for executive remuneration\" which are set out in the company's annual report. Talbut, who also chairs the investment committee of the Association of British Insurers, described the new sales target set by AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, as \"pretty stretching\". The target assumes that success from new drugs, in particular the cancer portfolio, will propel annual revenues by 75% to at least $45bn (\u00a326.5bn) by 2023. He added: \"That's why we are a little bit surprised that the management had not been prepared to engage more.\" A former top scientist at Pfizer has also cast doubt on the revenue targets. John LaMattina, who worked at the company for 30 years, wrote: \"To increase a company's sales by 75% in a decade largely from organic growth would be a remarkable feat.\" Some City analysts have also questioned whether the targets are achievable. Buxton supported his call for the bonuses of Soriot and his team to be linked to the Pfizer offer by citing the experience of shareholders in Abbey National, which was eventually sold to Santander after two previous bids were rejected. The management of Abbey, Buxton said, had presided over the \"implosion of the business, the need for an entirely new management team\" and an offer from Santander that was lower than the two that were rejected. He said he was supportive of those investors who were backing the decision by the AstraZeneca board to fend off Pfizer, describing the approach as an \"obvious piece of financial engineering\".",

      "body": "<p>AstraZeneca's biggest shareholder has called on the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker to hold fresh talks with its US rival Pfizer after the current offer period expires.</p> <p>Pressure is growing on AstraZeneca to resurrect talks in three months' time, while hopes are fading fast that a \u00a369bn deal to create the world's largest drugmaker will be agreed by next Monday's 5pm deadline. AstraZeneca shares in London closed 145p lower at \u00a342.75, a fall of 3.3%.</p> <p>BlackRock, the world's largest asset management group, is understood to be backing AstraZeneca's board over its refusal to recommend Pfizer's \u00a355 a share offer on Monday. But it wants directors to get back to the negotiating table as soon as takeover rules allow.</p> <p>BlackRock, which is also a big investor in Pfizer, increased its stake in AstraZeneca on Tuesday to 8.02% from 7.8%.</p> <p>AstraZeneca is also facing calls from investors to link the bonuses of its top management team to the offer price and the sales targets it has set out as a key plank of its campaign to stay independent.</p> <p>A leading City fund manager, Richard Buxton, the head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, said this would be a way to ensure that directors' pay was linked to the potential losses for shareholders.</p> <p>The AstraZeneca board's rejection of what Pfizer called a final offer prompted a split among investors as to whether talks should be reopened now or whether the management was right to refuse to accept the price. The rejection triggered a 11% fall in AstraZeneca's share price on Monday.</p> <p>Pfizer cannot raise its final proposal, and AstraZeneca directors are unlikely to change their minds before next Monday's deadline. However, under UK takeover rules Pfizer could come back with a new offer at the invitation of the AstraZeneca board in late August, and make an unsolicited bid in late November, after six months have elapsed. AstraZeneca's chairman, Leif Johansson, has said that the board would consider an offer at \u00a358.85 a share.</p> <p>The bookmaker Ladbrokes is offering odds of 3/1 for the takeover to be completed before Monday, and 5/4 for a deal to happen after they walk away, in a new offer period. One big shareholder said there is a reasonable chance a deal will get done later this year.</p> <p>AstraZeneca's second-largest shareholder, Vanguard, is a \"passive\" investor that holds a 4.74% stake through index funds that it manages. Legal &amp; General, the sixth-largest investor with a 3.4% holding, has reportedly written to AstraZeneca to ask it to reconsider its rejection of Pfizer's offer, and Axa Investment Managers, the UK arm of the French insurance group, said the company \"acted too hastily\".</p> <p>This means shareholders representing 16% of AstraZeneca shares, including BlackRock, want new talks with Pfizer.</p> <p>However, a number of other big investors, who together control more than 10% of the shares, have backed the approach of AstraZeneca's management. They include the fourth-largest shareholder, Sweden's Investor AB, which has a 4.1% stake and a seat on the board, along with Threadneedle Asset Management, Fidelity, M&amp;G and Aberdeen Asset Management and Neil Woodford, the veteran City investor who controls a \u00a3350m stake on behalf of St James's Place.</p> <p>Buxton wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5e08c310-e0fa-11e3-b59f-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"\">letter to the Financial Times</a>: \"A way to reassure investors that the board is convinced of the long-term value of its business is through alignment of interest.</p> <p>\"If the remuneration committee of AstraZeneca \u2013 and indeed any company rejecting an offer in favour of long-term independence \u2013 was to recalibrate any current and future incentives to vest only at the level of the spurned offer, it would provide comfort to shareholders that if things do not play out as the management envisage, the executives have shared in the pain felt by shareholders at the lost opportunity.\"</p> <p>Robert Talbut, the chief investment officer of Royal London Asset Management, which holds just under 1% of AstraZeneca, said: \"It is only fair and reasonable that if the management are so confident that they will be able to hit their targets that their remuneration should be linked to that.\"</p> <p>AstraZeneca said this was a matter for the remuneration committee, which is chaired by the former Barclays boss John Varley.

As demonstrators staged a second day of protests against the company\u2019s wage scale outside the company\u2019s suburban Chicago headquarters, Thompson told shareholders: \"We believe we pay fair and competitive wages.\u201d \u201cI know we have people outside,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cI think that McDonald\u2019s provides more opportunity than any other company \u2026 We continue to believe that we pay fair and competitive wages,\u201d he said. Thompson said the company offered opportunities to young people, and the training for them to build careers. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s has done that throughout time, and will continue to do that,\u201d he said. Outside the meeting, from which journalists were barred, protesters called on the company to raise its wages to a minimum of $15 an hour. On Wednesday, 139 people, including 101 fast-food employees, were arrested after staging a protest outside the company\u2019s headquarters. McDonald\u2019s closed the largest office on its campus beforeo the protest, sending 2,000 employees home for the day, citing traffic concerns. Outside the meeting, protesters chanted: \u201cWe work, we sweat, put $15 on my check.\" Workers from Detroit chanted: \u201cHey hey, ho ho, $7.40 has got to go,\u201d referring to their minimum wage salaries in Michigan. The protests were the latest in a series by fast-food and retail workers in the US, who have been campaigning for a raise in the minimum wage and the right to join unions without recrimination. Earlier this month, fast-food workers in dozens of cities walked off their jobs in a day of protest over wages. Thompson comfortably survived a vote questioning his $9.5m pay package for 2013. The \u201csay on pay\u201d protest vote was organised by Change to Win Investment Group (Ctw), which recently won a similar vote at Chipotle, which is now reviewing executive compensation. Thompson was also quizzed about the company\u2019s marketing to tactics to children. In the meeting Casey Hinds, a mother from Lexington, Kentucky, said Ronald McDonald was \"the Joe Camel of fast food.\" The company was also accused of being \u201cpredatory\u201d in its marketing to children. \u201cWe are not predatory. It\u2019s the truth,\u201d said Thompson. He said the company\u2019s marketing was \u201cnot intended to be anything other than fun for kids.\u201d \u201cWe are people. We do have values at McDonald's. We are parents,\" said Thompson. He said the company offered healthy choices and had sold over 1.1bn apple slices. \u201cMy parents eat McDonald\u2019s and they are here today \u2013 they are quite healthy,\u201d he said.",

On Wednesday, 139 people, including 101 fast-food employees, were arrested after staging a protest outside the company\u2019s headquarters. </p> <p>McDonald\u2019s closed the largest office on its campus beforeo the protest, sending 2,000 employees home for the day, citing traffic concerns.</p> <p>Outside the meeting, protesters chanted: \u201cWe work, we sweat, put $15 on my check.\" Workers from Detroit chanted: \u201cHey hey, ho ho, $7.40 has got to go,\u201d referring to their minimum wage salaries in Michigan.</p> <p>The protests were the latest in a series by fast-food and retail workers in the US, who have been campaigning for a raise in the minimum wage and the right to join unions without recrimination. Earlier this month, fast-food workers in dozens of cities walked off their jobs in a day of protest over wages.<b><br></b></p> <p>Thompson comfortably survived a vote questioning his $9.5m pay package for 2013. The \u201csay on pay\u201d protest vote was organised by Change to Win Investment Group (Ctw), which recently won a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/15/chipotle-fails-majority-shareholder-support-executive-pay\">similar vote at Chipotle</a>, which is now reviewing executive compensation.</p> <p>Thompson was also quizzed about the company\u2019s marketing to tactics to children. In the meeting Casey Hinds, a mother from Lexington, Kentucky, said Ronald McDonald was \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Camel\">the Joe Camel</a> of fast food.\" The company was also accused of being \u201cpredatory\u201d in its marketing to children.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not predatory. It\u2019s the truth,\u201d said Thompson. He said the company\u2019s marketing was \u201cnot intended to be anything other than fun for kids.\u201d<b><br></b></p> <p>\u201cWe are people. We do have values at McDonald's. We are parents,\" said Thompson. He said the company offered healthy choices and had sold over 1.1bn apple slices. \u201cMy parents eat McDonald\u2019s and they are here today \u2013 they are quite healthy,\u201d he said.</p>",

economic recovery remains on track, a closely watched survey showed on Thursday.<br></p> <p>However the report also highlighted continuing problems for France, lagging further behind powerhouse Germany which goes from strength to strength, analysts said. </p> <p>\"Relatively reassuring for the Eurozone overall but certainly not for France,\" said <b>Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight.</b> </p> <p>Analysts said France's problems continue, despite President Francois Hollande's recent government makeover, and were adding to wider deflation pressures which the European Central Bank must counter. </p> <p>Deflation, an outright fall in prices, can be fatal as people put off purchases in the hope they can buy cheaper later. </p> <p>That dampens demand, leading companies to put off investment, which in turn hits wages and jobs, and so demand again, setting off a vicious downward spiral. </p> <p>Markit Economics said its May Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), a leading economic indicator, slipped to 53.9 points from 54 in April. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0cfab5c4-bcdb-472c-a771-70a5e829513f\"> <img

at the second-highest level of the past three years, and the average for the second quarter so far was running at its best since the three months to June 2011 period, Markit said. </p> <p>Germany was at 56.1 points while France fell back under the 50-points boom-bust line at 49.3. </p> <p>The May services sector PMI hit a 35-month high of 53.5 points, up from 53.1 in April, while the manufacturing PMI fell to 52.5 points, a six-month low, from 53.4 in April. </p> <p>The report was welcome after overall economic growth in the 18-nation eurozone slowed unexpectedly to 0.2 percent in the first quarter, well short of forecasts for 0.4 percent.</p> <p><b>Markit chief economist Chris Williamson</b> said the slight PMI easing in May \"doesn't change the picture of a region that's enjoying its best spell of growth for three years.\"</p> <p>The figures suggest the eurozone economy could grow \"0.5 percent in the second quarter after the lacklustre 0.2 percent rise in the first three months,\" Williamson said.</p> <p>However, there were two concerns, he said, deflation pressures and a struggling France.</p> <p>\"Of greatest concern is France, living up to its moniker of 'sick man of Europe' by sliding back into contraction as Germany continues to enjoy robust growth\" at its best since mid-2007, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

      "bodyText": "A slight dip in eurozone growth, according to the latest PMI surveys, left European markets struggling for direction, writes Nick Fletcher. The French private sector contracted this month, but Germany continued to power ahead, while the US and China also reported strong figures. But investors remained cautious, not least because of continuing geo-political concerns, notably regarding Ukraine, Korea and Thailand. Here are the final scores: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, down 0.48 points at 6820.56 \u2022 Germany's Dax ended 0.24% higher at 9720.91 \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.21% at 4478.21 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB lost 1.09% to 20,372.68 \u2022 Spain's Ibex dipped 0.1% to 10,520.6 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 20 points or 0.12%. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Speaking of Greece, we will have an exclusive interview later with the country\u2019s deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who tells Helena Smith just how close his country came to being ejected from the eurozone. Fitch is timetabled to give a ratings update on Greece tomorrow, and there is already talk of a positive outcome: Time to catch-up on the main events of the day. Concerns that France's economy is stagnating have been fuelled by new data showing its private sector is contracting this month. Market's monthly PMI report found that French firms were suffering from \"lacklustre demand conditions, tight client budgets and delays in decision-making\". Economists said France was cementing its reputation as Europe's 'sick man'. May is turning into another strong month for Germany, though, with its service sector growing at a 35-month high. Overall, Markit found that the eurozone private sector is growing at a steady rate this month. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: \u201cA slight easing in the euro area\u201fs rate of growth was seen in May but doesn\u201ft change the picture of a region that\u201fs enjoying its best spell of growth for three years, especially when an acceleration in growth of new orders suggests that the pace of expansion could pick up again in June. GDP looks set to rise by 0.5% in the second quarter after the lacklustre 0.2% rise in the first three months of the year.\" As Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight put it: \"Relatively reassuring for the Eurozone overall but certainly not for France.\" Other PMI surveys showed a mixed picture. US factory activity is accelerating, while China and Japan's manufacturing sectors shrank slightly. In other economic news... we have confirmation that the UK grew by 0.8% last quarter, thanks to household spending and business investment. Details start here In Greece, sacked cleaning staff have occupied the finance ministry building; telling us that they are determined to make the government comply with a court ruling to reinstate them. More photos here. And Germany's Deutsche Bank was also hit by protests outside its AGM, and faced angry investors inside the hall. Royal Mail shares have now slumped 9%, as investors baulk at its warning of rising competition. An investigation has also exposed how many 'priority investors' rushed to sell the shares they were sold in last autumn's float. Sky News has now posted its full story about US fund manager Blackrock's views over Pfizer's attempt to take over AstraZeneca. And intriguingly, Mark Kleinman says Blackrock is pushing for talks to resume in a few months, as allowed under City rules. He writes: AstraZeneca\u2019s biggest shareholder wants the pharmaceuticals group to consider renewing talks with Pfizer about a \u00a369bn takeover offer once a curfew period imposed by City regulators has expired. Sky News has learnt that fund managers at BlackRock, which owns approximately 8% of AstraZeneca, have told its directors that they should re-engage with Pfizer, potentially after a three-month hiatus that is likely to come into force next week under UK takeover rules. Pfizer has to walk away for six month, if a deal isn't reached by Monday. However... The British group could approach Pfizer to enter talks in three months' time, an approach that BlackRock and others now appear to be endorsing. BlackRock Urges AstraZeneca To Hold New Talks Thought for the day: The City is already swirling with flotation plans, with four companies announcing IPO plans this morning alone (City AM's Peter Spence has the details). And now there's rumours that a big one -- the float of Lloyds' TSB operation - will come next week. Reuters reckons that Lloyds will float 25% of TSB next week, with the price probably \"at the bottom\" of previous guidance. That would make sense -- investors' appetite for IPOs appears to be waning; Saga, for example, cut the price of its flotation yesterday. Fat Face, the fashion retailer, has already been hit by the change in sentiment the hard way - it pulled its float plans this morning. More US economic data: existing home sales (ie, not newbuilds) rose by 1.3% in April, reversing March's 0.2% decline. Fewer householders were forced to sell their homes, too - the percentage of distressed homes hitting the market fell to 15%, from 18% in March 2013. More data -- and activity in America's factory sector has surged this month, in the latest signal that the US economy is growing after its winter woes. The US Manufacturing PMI jumped to 56.2 this month, up from 55.4 in April, which is a three month high. Firms reported a strong rise in production and output; they also hired more staff. Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit, said the US economy appears to be rebounding having seen no meaningful growth in the first quarter of 2014. \u201cThe US manufacturing sector continued to gain strength heading into mid-year as supportive demand conditions led to the sharpest month-on- month increase in production for over three years. \u201cThis provides further confirmation that industry will aid a rebound in U.S. GDP in the second quarter, and other indicators from the survey suggest that the sector has plenty of momentum heading into the summer and beyond.\" South Africa's central bank has not been tempted to follow Turkey's lead -- it voted to leave all its interest rates unchanged today. It also warned that the risks to the South African economy are \"increasingly to the downside\", and that the rand remains \"vulnerable to global perceptions of US monetary policy\". The cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil has risen to a two and a half-month high of $110.77, on the back of the pick-up in Chinese factory output this month (see opening post for details and graphs). Another twist in the AstraZeneca bid? Sky News is reporting that BlackRock, AstraZeneca's biggest shareholder, is \"keen for the company to engage in more talks\" about the takeover. That's pulled AstraZeneca shares back up a bit - they're now down 1.3% at \u00a343.65, having been down over 2% earlier. BlackRock owns 7.6% of AstraZeneca. Technically, Pfizer must walk away on Monday 26 May if AstraZeneca doesn't agree an offer by then; it can't raise its \u00a355 per share offer again, as it said it was its \"final offer\". Just in -- the number of Americans signing on for jobless benefit has risen, after touching a seven-year low earlier this month. The initial jobless claims rose by 28,000 to 326,000 last week, having dipped to just 298,000 the previous seven days. This rise may suggest job creation in May won't match April's strong performance (although this weekly reading can be volatile). Another photo from the Deutsche Bank AGM protests (full coverage here) Back to the protesting cleaners in Greece who have barricaded themselves inside the finance ministry (photos here) to demand their jobs back, following a courtroom victory last week. Our correspondent, Helena Smith, who has just been speaking with the fired employees, says passions have become increasingly high octane as the women dig in their heels. Nearly seven hours after the stand off began, the sacked cleaners are saying they're going nowhere. \"There are 12 of us inside this building, we've chained the door and we're here to stay,\" said Despoina Kostopoulou, the group's unofficial spokesperson. \"For as long as is needed we will stay here. I have spent the last 13 nights in the tent outside [the offices of the Greek national economy ministry] and I have no problem staying inside. The police came and were actually very polite asking us to step outside. Then they left but now things are getting testy. Their patience is running thin but we've explained we don't have a choice. Unless we get the jobs that were so unfairly taken away from us, we are not going anywhere.\" Kostopoulou, who says she has to fend for two grown up daughters \"who are both out of work\" says the cleaners are bracing for a fight. \"Passions are rising, you can see it yourself. We expect the worst. But we are not going to give in.\" The employees, who are iconic symbols of austerity's inequity, said they would only leave the building once they had seen a finance ministry official \"and preferably the minister\" who guaranteed, in writing, that they would respect the court's verdict and return to work next week. Here's a round-up of this morning's eurozone economic data, from AFP, explaining why France is dragging its feet behind the rest of the eurozone. (to spare new readers from scrolling back to 8am for the live coverage) Eurozone business activity slips, France struggles for growth Eurozone business activity slipped slightly in May but held near a three-year high, suggesting a modest economic recovery remains on track, a closely watched survey showed on Thursday. However the report also highlighted continuing problems for France, lagging further behind powerhouse Germany which goes from strength to strength, analysts said. \"Relatively reassuring for the Eurozone overall but certainly not for France,\" said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight. Analysts said France's problems continue, despite President Francois Hollande's recent government makeover, and were adding to wider deflation pressures which the European Central Bank must counter. Deflation, an outright fall in prices, can be fatal as people put off purchases in the hope they can buy cheaper later. That dampens demand, leading companies to put off investment, which in turn hits wages and jobs, and so demand again, setting off a vicious downward spiral. Markit Economics said its May Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), a leading economic indicator, slipped to 53.9 points from 54 in April. The composite indicator was at the second-highest level of the past three years, and the average for the second quarter so far was running at its best since the three months to June 2011 period, Markit said. Germany was at 56.1 points while France fell back under the 50-points boom-bust line at 49.3. The May services sector PMI hit a 35-month high of 53.5 points, up from 53.1 in April, while the manufacturing PMI fell to 52.5 points, a six-month low, from 53.4 in April. The report was welcome after overall economic growth in the 18-nation eurozone slowed unexpectedly to 0.2 percent in the first quarter, well short of forecasts for 0.4 percent. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said the slight PMI easing in May \"doesn't change the picture of a region that's enjoying its best spell of growth for three years.\" The figures suggest the eurozone economy could grow \"0.5 percent in the second quarter after the lacklustre 0.2 percent rise in the first three months,\" Williamson said. However, there were two concerns, he said, deflation pressures and a struggling France. \"Of greatest concern is France, living up to its moniker of 'sick man of Europe' by sliding back into contraction as Germany continues to enjoy robust growth\" at its best since mid-2007, he said. - Deflation threat remains - Archer said the report was \"relatively reassuring news for hopes that (a) modest eurozone economic recovery remains intact.\" However, \"the eurozone is clearly not finding it at all easy to build up growth momentum,\" he added. Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics said the report suggested the eurozone recovery \"remains lacklustre\" and also highlighted the divergence between France and Germany. The May figures were consistent with second-quarter economic growth of 0.4 percent, Hinds said, but that \"will still not be strong enough to eliminate the risks of deflation.\" ECB head Maria Draghi and other officials have made clear in recent weeks that they expect to take further measures in June to boost the economy to head off the deflation threat. Confirmation that the Turkish interest rate cut was a surprise: Twitter has more photos of the protests outside, and inside, Deutsche Bank's AGM today. I've covered a few AGM protests in my time, but I've never seen demonstrators turn up with a cardboard tank before. But this was the scene outside Deutsche Bank's annual general meeting in Frankfurt today, as a demonstrator protested against the bank for lending to arms manufacturers: Demonstrators also slammed the company over allegations of tax evasion. In 2012, police raided its offices as part of an investigation into a tax evasion scheme involving carbon permit trading, with 25 staff being investigated. The mood wasn't much better inside the AGM. One of Deutsche Bank top investors criticised the bank over its plans to raise \u20ac8 euros ($11 billion) in new equity, while a long list of scandals and investigations hang over it. Reuters reports: Frankfurt-based Union Investment said Deutsche Bank needed to re-examine its corporate governance practices after bills for fines and settlements rose to more than 5 billion euros in the past two years. \"Much investor trust has been wasted. The capital hike is not helping,\" said fund manager Ingo Speich at Union Investment in the text of a speech to be delivered at the bank's annual shareholders' meeting. \"When is this nightmare finally going to end?\" Speich said. \"Stockholders and investors are losing their patience with legal battles, fines and breaches of corporate governance and compliance.\" Last December, Deutsche was fined \u20ac725m for its role in the Libor scandal, and is being investigated over allegations that the foreign exchange market has been rigged. The FT's Alice Ross has more details of the investor angst on display: Surprise: Turkey's central bank just cut one of its interest rates, four months after it dramatically hiked borrowing costs as the emerging market crisis flared up. The Turkish Central Bank cut the one-week refinancing rate to 9.5%, from 10%. But it left the overnight lending rate at 12%, and the overnight borrowing rate at 8%. Royal Mail shares have continued to slide - they are now down over 7% after it warned this morning about tough competition from newer entrants to the postal service (full story here). Speaking of Royal Mail, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has been probing the 'priority investors' who were allocated shares in last autumn's privatisation. The government said these shareholders were chosen because they were the right sort of owners for the company.... .... but BIJ reports they actually sold 43% of their shares in the first six days after the float. That netted them a profit of at least \u00a398m. Nice work if you can get it. Here's the full report. Adrian Bailey MP, chair of the Business Innovation and Skills Committee, isn't impressed: \"This does not meet the Minister\u2019s declared commitment that control of the Royal Mail would be in the hands of responsible long term investors. The allocation of shares adopted by the ministers has exposed their promises as na\u00efve or downright misleading. The city has acted true to type - the financial institutions have made huge profits whilst the taxpayer has lost out.\" Ironically, those priority shareholders would have done even better if they'd showed some long-term vision. Royal Mail shares soared from 330p to 455p on the first day of trading last October, up to 490p after a week. But even after today's slide, they're still worth 530p.... Here's our story on the new British GDP data, showing business spending helped drive the UK recovery this year: UK economic figures show jump in business investment Britain's economic record as one of the fastest-growing major economies has been confirmed by official figures showing a jump in business investment, construction and manufacturing in the first three months of the year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy had grown by 0.8%, pushing the annual growth rate above 3% and well above those of the eurozone and the US. Economists cheered the 8.7% year-on-year rise in business investment, which is a key indicator of improving confidence among the UK's larger companies, though consumer spending continued to take the lead and the government's finances deteriorated last month..... (more here) AstraZeneca shares have fallen 2% to \u00a343.25 today, after the prospect of a Pfizer takeover at \u00a355 per share succeeding dwindle yet further. Some shareholders are still pretty upset that the final offer was rejected; one investor has come up with an innovative way of making AstraZeneca's board pay the price of rejecting the offer: Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, suggests that bonuses should only be awarded if Astra's share price breaks above the \u00a355 level. Full story here. Activity in Britain's factory sector remained \"solid\" in May, according to the CBI's monthly survey of the sector. Some 36% of firms said the volume of output over the last three months was up and 21% said it was down, giving a balance of +15% for the third consecutive month - well above the long-term average of +2%. Companies are also very positive about the future - with 39% predicting growth, and 7% a decline (last month, confidence hit a 41-year high). But the CBI fears that the recovery faces headwinds: Katja Hall, their deputy director-general, warned: The recent rise in sterling, coupled with a tepid recovery in the Eurozone could weigh on export demand. As the UK\u2019s economic recovery gains a firmer footing, we need to ramp up manufacturing exports to high-growth markets, driving job creation here in the UK. Greece's finance ministry has been occupied today by sacked cleaning workers, who have taken over the entrance to demand that the government complies with a court ruling that they should be reinstated. Athens judges ruled last week that 393 finance ministry cleaning staff were wrongly suspended from their jobs last week, as part of the Greece's programme of cutting thousands of public sector jobs. But Antonis Samaras's government has, so far, refused to implement the court's decision - prompting the cleaning staff to block the ministry's front entrance to demand action. Enet English's Damian Mac Con Uladh has more details: Early on Thursday, a group of cleaners placed a chain and padlocked the doors to the ministry from within, while colleagues of theirs sat down in front of the building. A large contingent of riot police is at the scene. It is understood that they have told the cleaners that they will intervene unless the protest ends. Britain borrowed more than expected to balance the books in April. Last month's public finances, released at 9.30am, showed that Public Sector Net Borrowing (excluding financial interventions) was \u00a37.364bn, up from \u00a35.648bn a year ago. Economists had expected a figure around \u00a34.5bn. The figures sent the pound falling a little against the US dollar, down 0.2% to $1.6871. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, explained: \u201cWhile a second estimate of UK\u2019s GDP printed in line with expectations this morning, it was the weak public sector borrowing data that took markets by surprise.\" The ONS reported that: Corporation tax receipts were up 9.6% year-on-year in April, to \u00a35.1bn. Income tax revenues fell by 6.8% y/y to \u00a311.1bn VAT receipts rose by 4.1% y/y to \u00a39.bn Stamp duties (on shares, land &amp; property) surged by 29.8% to \u00a31.1 billion. The full report is here (pdf) Ed Conway of Sky News highlights how household spending is driving the UK recovery: Britain's economy is now just 0.6% from its pre-crisis peak, the Office for National Statistics added, having grown by 0.8% in Q1. But that means it's still a much slower recovery from recession than in the 1970s, 80s or 90s. The ONS also reports that there was a substantial rise in UK business spending in the first three months of this year - helping to grow the economy by 0.8%. It reports that business investment surged by 2.7% quarter-on-quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2013. Household spending rose by 0.8% quarter-on-quarter And government spending rose by just 0.1%. More detail: Service sector: grew by 0.9% (highest since the third quarter of 2011) Industrial output: up 0.7% Construction: up 0.6% The Office for National Statistics has just confirmed that the UK economy grew by 0.8% in the first three months of this year, in line with its initial estimate. Alice Ross of the Financial Times reports that Deutsche Bank's AGM has been disrupted by protestors, who have now been \"roughly\" removed from the meeting. Overall, the eurozone private sector is recording quite respectable growth this month, according to Markit. Its Composite PMI index (which surveys thousands of firms) came in at 53.9, a slight drop in April's three-year high of 54, but still showing solid growth. Service sector firms led the way, with activity hitting a 35-month high. Output across the sector increased for an eleventh month running. Growth in new orders hit a three-year high. Employment rose at fastest rate since September 2011. But that, of course, disguises the fact that Germany is growing strongly (details here) while France continues to languish far behind with its firms reporting that activity is declining (details here). As Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit, put it: Of greatest concern is France, living up to its moniker of \"sick man of Europe\u201f by sliding back into contraction as Germany continues to enjoy robust growth and the rest of the region experiences its best expansion since mid-2007.\u201d As this chart shows, France's is stagnating just as many peripheral countries finally enjoy a period of growth: But while France stumbles, Germany powers ahead. Its service sector firms are growing at their fastest rate in almost three years, with firms hiring new staff at the fastest rate in 29 months. Markit's 'flash' survey of the German private sector came in at a healthy-looking PMI of 56.1. That's unchanged from April, showing solid growth across Europe's largest economy. Service firms led the way -- with activity rising at the fastest rate in 35 months. Manufacturers, through, reported slower growth. Here's the details: New orders have risen, for the 11th month in a row, thanks to \"higher activity in the auto industry, a general positive economic environment and the securing of new clients\". And German firms are also taking on more staff --- the rate of job creation accelerated for the second month running, to the fastest rate since late-2011. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, says Germany is on track to report another quarter of solid growth: \u201cRecovery prospects in Germany\u2019s private sector continued to brighten in May, with the flash PMI signalling further solid increases in activity and new orders. Furthermore, we saw rising workloads feed through to meaningful employment gains, with the latest rate of job creation the highest since late-2011.\" Another worrying point in today's disappointing French private sector data: Input costs (including salaries) have risen to a four-month high, but output costs (what firms charge) fell. That doesn't suggest French firms became more competitive: Jeremy Cook of World First says it's a bad sign: Another blow to the French economy --- its private sector has slipped into contraction this month. Data firm Markit reports that output shrank across France's service companies and manufacturing firms in May, for the first time since February. French firms suffered a drop in new business, and blamed \"lacklustre demand conditions, tight client budgets and delays in decision-making\" -- all a sign that the French economy is stagnating. (there was no growth in the first three months of 2014) French companies also cut staff for the seventh month in a row, and at the fastest rate since February. This drove Markit's \"Composite Output Index\" (measuring activity across the country) to a three-month low of 49.3. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, said France\u2019s \"stuttering economic performance\" continues this month. \"With new orders and employment both falling at sharper rates in the latest month, the malaise looks set to persist, dashing hopes of any convincing recovery taking hold.\u201d Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet says the data means the French economy continues to treat water: OUCH. Shares in Royal Mail have tumbled 5% at the start of trading in London, after the recently privatised company warned that it faces growing commercial pressure. While Royal Mail posted a 6% rise in profits this morning, investors are alarmed that it flagged up increasing competition in the parcels and letters sector. Moya Greene, Royal Mail\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur performance was in line with our expectations. We are facing a couple of headwinds. The competitive environment on the parcels side is more intense. We are taking steps to remain the leader in this growing market. \u201cOn the letters side, the headwind is direct delivery and we have strategies in place to counter its adverse financial impact. However, without timely regulatory action, direct delivery could undermine the economics of the universal service.\u201d Royal Mail also said it faced \"intense competition\" in the parcels business - a key area of growth for the company. It fears it could lose \u00a3200m of revenue within three years, if it loses a dispute with TNT Post over how much Royal Mail charges its rival to deliver items already collected and sorted by TNT staff. Shares are down 29p at 547p, which is around 65% above the price Royal Mail was privatised at last autumn. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, is encouraged by the data, saying: HSBC China PMI Manufacturing beat expectations, hitting a 5-month high and getting back up near the 50 level which distinguishes growth from contraction. Could this be a sign of stabilisation? Japan\u2019s PMI Manufacturing (prelim) also improved to near breakeven. The latest survey of Japan's factories was also encouraging. It's manufacturing PMI was a whisker away from expansion, at 49.9 (up from 49.4 in April). That suggests the sector may be shrugging off the impact of April's sales tax hike. Shares jumped across Asia, following the news that China's factory PMI had hit a five-month high. Japan's Nikkei posted its biggest rise in a month, surging 295 points to 14,337. Reuters reports: Japan's Nikkei share average boasted its biggest rise in a month on Thursday as a survey showing an improvement in Chinese manufacturing added to an already upbeat mood after the US Federal Reserve reaffirmed its commitment to support the economy. The Nikkei rose 2.1 percent to 14,337.79, with news government-controlled Japan Post Insurance Life is ramping up its investment in Japanese stocks providing the icing on the cake Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. And a busy morning for economic data begins with encouraging signs from China, where factory activity has moved closer to expansion again this month. The monthly \"flash\" PMI index for May rose to 49.7, up from 48.1 in April. That's a five-month high -- and tantalisingly close to the 50 point mark that shows whether activity across the sector rose or fell. Output, new orders and exports are all rising this month - an encouraging sign for China, and the global economy. HSBC, who compile the data, said a 'broad-based' recovery had helped the Chinese manufacturing PMI to rebound. But it's not all rosy -- factories continues to cut staff, which may alarm Beijing and prompt further stimulus measures. Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief economist for China, explains: Some tentative signs of stabilization are emerging, partly as a result of the recent mini-stimulus measures and lower borrowing costs. But downside risks to growth remain, particularly as the property market continues to cool. We think more policy easing is needed to put a floor under growth in the coming months.\u201d Here's the details: That was enough to send Asian stock markets higher, where investors were also cheered by last night's minutes from the Federal Reserve (which suggested US interest rates will remain at current record lows for some time). So what else is happening today?.... We get flash PMI data from France and Germany shortly -- which could show if the eurozone's two-largest economies are diverging. The second estimate of Britain's GDP for the first quarter of 2014 is released too, at 9.30am. That is expected to confirm that output grew at 0.8% in the three months to March. And in the City -- results from Royal Mail are being closely scrutinised. It's warning that Britain's Universal Service could be under threat.... I\"ll be tracking the key developments through the day....",

SABMiller climbed 112.5p to \u00a333.72 after it announced a 1% rise in full year profits to $6.45bn, and unveiled a new cost cutting programme to save $500m a year by 2018. As IG noted, mining shares were boosted by the positive Chinese data, with Antofagasta adding 15p to 786p and Fresnillo 15.5p better at 845p. Smith and Nephew rose 20p to 956p after UK competition authorities cleared its proposed $1.7bn acquisition of Texas-based medical devices business ArthoCare. But Royal Mail dropped 56p to 519p as it warned of increased competition. Royal Dutch Shell B shares slid 95p to 2456.5p after it agreed to sell its 100% interest in 106,000 acres of oil and gas properties in Texas to Sanchez Energy for $639m. It has also decided to scrap its scrip dividend. Retailer Halfords accelerated to the top of the FTSE 250, up 46.6p to 488p after strong demand for cycles in the final quarter - up 41.6% - helped boost full year sales by 7.9% and profits by 1.1% to a better than expected \u00a372.8m. But a number of other mid-cap companies fell sharply after their updates. Dairy Crest dropped 32.1p to 427.9p despite a 31% rise in full year profits to \u00a365.3m. Investors were concerned about the outlook, with the company saying higher costs would reduce profits in its milk business in the current year. Traders also pointed out that last year's profits including property sales and lower financing costs. Polymetal, the Russian gold and silver miner, fell 32.5p to 510.5p after agreeing to pay $618.5m for a gold project in Kazakhstan. And Electrocomponents lost 8.4p to 280.6p after the electronic products distributor reported just 2% growth in sales for the first seven weeks of its financial year after full year profits rose 7.4%. Analysts at Jefferies said: 2014 results were exactly in line with consensus but revenue momentum has been softer than expected at the start of the new year and strategic initiatives required to drive growth continue to weigh on profitability. We downgrade 2015 earnings per share by 6%. Hold.",

The company said Niall Wass, who was appointed chief executive in November 2013, will \"leave the business in the next few weeks to take a position at another company\". Wass, a former Betfair executive who has been working at Wonga since march 2012, was promoted to the top job last year in an attempt to move Damelin out of the spotlight as the company came under sustained attack from politicians and the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. At the time Damelin said Wass's appointment would allow the company to \"focus on where Wonga should be heading in the next decade\". Damelin, who is now chairman but also expected to leave the company soon, was not available to comment on Wass's sudden exit. The company did not explain why Wass was leaving so quickly, stating only that he had \"agreed with the board that he will stay for a handover period to enure a smooth transition of duties\". His responsibilities as CEO were handed over to the finance director, Tim Weller, with \"immediate effect\". In a statement, Wass said: \"My time with the company has been busy and productive, seeing Wonga launch in several new markets, but we're now at the beginning of a new chapter and I felt the time was right to take a new opportunity elsewhere. There are some exceptional people here and Tim is inheriting a strong team.\" The company, which has been criticised by Labour MP Stella Creasy for \"legal loan-sharking\", will soon be subject to much tighter regulation to try to prevent payday lenders preying on struggling families. From July Wonga will be subject to new City regulator rules that restrict the number of times that loans can be rolled over or extended to two and prevent firms making more than two unsuccessful attempts to take cash from customers' bank accounts. The Financial Conduct Authority rule changes are designed to prevent lenders advancing money to borrowers who cannot afford repayment. The sector is also being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority. Martin Wheatley, the FCA chief executive, has said the new rules will leave \"no place in an FCA-regulated consumer credit market for payday lenders that only care about making a fast buck\". In March it emerged Wonga was trialling longer loans alongside its core payday loans and had also dropped a service that allow customers to borrow at the checkout when buying at a handful of online stores.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's economic record as one of the fastest-growing major economies has been confirmed by official figures showing a jump in business investment, construction and manufacturing in the first three months of the year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy had grown by 0.8%, pushing the annual growth rate above 3% and well above those of the eurozone and the US. Economists cheered the 8.7% year-on-year rise in business investment, which is a key indicator of improving confidence among the UK's larger companies, though consumer spending continued to take the lead and the government's finances deteriorated last month. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said the ONS's first revision of GDP numbers published last month showed the recovery was looking \"better balanced and more sustainable, with business investment, manufacturing and construction outpacing growth in the wider economy\". In separate figures for the services sector, the ONS said a strong performance by the distribution, business services and finance sectors had also bolstered Britain's economy. A renewed appetite for eating out and spending a few nights in a hotel added to the good news, spurring the UK's services sector to maintain its performance over the past couple of years as the bedrock of the recovery while construction and manufacturing play catch-up. The index of services increased by 3.1% in March 2014 compared with March 2013, the ONS said, with all of the four main components of the services industries increasing on the same month a year ago. Growth strengthened between February and March, with official estimates showing that output increased by 0.4% after an increase of just 0.2% between January and February. The services sector was the first to recover from the recession and has maintained a steady growth rate since 2012. However, the components of that growth have shifted as government spending has fallen back in favour of private sector expansion, much of it driven by manufacturing and a recovery in the housing market. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said an improvement in the export sector held the key for the economy's long-term health. \"We have now seen five consecutive quarters of business investment growth which, while very encouraging, is still only part of the rebalancing story as net trade is still doing nothing for the overall growth picture. \"If, however, the very strong export indicators seen in recent business surveys are a sign of things to come, we should finally start to see some clear signs that rebalancing is under way in the coming quarters.\" Figures show the public sector's net borrowing in April excluding temporary effects was \u00a37.4bn. This was \u00a31.7bn higher than in April 2013, when it was \u00a35.6bn \u2013 a blow to the Treasury, which wants to get the deficit down by half by the end of the year from its recession peak. Nevertheless, the deficit remains on a downward path over the year, falling \u00a37.8bn from \u00a3115.1bn last April to \u00a3107.4bn last month. The Treasury said the figures showed manufacturing and construction growing more quickly than previously thought and business investment seeing its longest period of expansion in 16 years. A Treasury spokesman added: \"The deficit has fallen by a third and is forecast to have halved by the end of the year. But today's public sector finance figures remind us that we cannot take this for granted. And as the chancellor said at budget, we still need to export more. \"The biggest risk now to economic security would be abandoning the plan that is laying the foundations for a brighter economic future.\"",

Thus investors don\u2019t seem to view Australia as a greater risk since the budget was handed down.</p> <p>As former finance journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrDenmore/status/468580075554631681\">Jim Parker</a> noted on Twitter, the value of credit default swaps (CDS) for Australian government bonds remains very low.
