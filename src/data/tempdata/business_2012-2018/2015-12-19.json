      "bodyText": "Two weeks ago, the Carlisle Tesco was under water, supermarket, petrol station, car park and all. Staff had been evacuated after the nearby river burst its banks, and the flood waters eventually breached the doors of the store and rose to waist height in the aisles. However, in the grocery industry\u2019s equivalent of a Christmas miracle, the store has been resurrected. A team of almost 100 people has built a temporary 10,000 sq ft shop in the flooded supermarket\u2019s car park. The temporary store now stands as a monument to the town\u2019s community spirit. But it is also a reminder of how crucial the Christmas period is for grocery retailers. The days leading up to 25 December can make or break a grocery retailer\u2019s year. With households eagerly stocking up on turkey, trimmings, party food and booze, it is the busiest period of the year by far. Analysts at Visa expect trading to reach an annual peak between 1pm and 2pm on 23 December. The battle among supermarkets for sales is fierce. Some shopping patterns are set in stone \u2013 many households will turn to Marks &amp; Spencer for their Christmas dinner, with the company accounting for one in four turkeys eaten on Christmas Day. But the retailers still spend millions on Christmas advertising and money-off vouchers in the hope of enticing consumers into their stores. Competition this year will be particularly fierce in the face of rivalry from discounters Aldi and Lidl, online stores and ever more popular convenience stores. And price deflation also means that retailers cannot count on price rises and inflation to flatter their figures. \u201cI think this is going to be the toughest Christmas we have ever seen \u2013 after the toughest year we have seen,\u201d says Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst. \u201cThe discount players have finally hit critical mass: their buying power on a much narrower range of products often exceeds that of the majors. We are seeing that in the way Aldi and Lidl are able to grow their market share.\u201d He also warned that the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 are going into Christmas week in a precarious state: \u201cThe majors have shot themselves in the foot. They have fragmented the buying patterns of their customers [by moving into online and convenience stores]. The economics of their business have changed fundamentally. If you look at the collective market share of those companies, it has gone down by around \u00a32bn year on year, but they haven\u2019t edited their space, not really. Tesco has shut some stores and curtailed development slightly, but to all intents and purposes they have got the same amount of retail space, if not more, and that has to be spread over diminishing sales. \u201cNext year will be tougher still, because there are cost headwinds in terms of the national living wage, and you can be certain there will be more capacity than there is now.\u201d With the industry under unprecedented pressure, the stakes are high, and the divide between winners and losers could be stark. Tesco Britain\u2019s biggest retailer may lose its position at the top of the tree if recent trends continue. Tesco has endured a miserable year, with its share price down by 42% since mid-April. This means Tesco\u2019s market value now stands at \u00a311.4bn, just ahead of clothing chain Next, which is worth \u00a311.2bn. Next could well overtake Tesco \u2013 despite the fact that it generates just \u00a34bn in annual sales compared with \u00a370bn for the supermarket chain. The reason for the share price fall is that the City is concerned about Tesco\u2019s performance and the lack of progress being made by Dave Lewis, who became chief executive last September, in improving its stores. The latest market share figures show that Tesco sales fell by 3.4% in the past 12 weeks, the joint worst performance in the industry, alongside Asda. Everything Lewis tries seems to be overshadowed by Tesco\u2019s rivals \u2013 the company has cut prices, but the discounters have cut theirs too; Lewis launched a high-profile Christmas TV advertising campaign featuring well-known actors, but Sainsbury\u2019s stole the show with Mog the cat. Tesco is struggling to attract shoppers, but it is also hamstrung by the fact that it has too many stores for this new age of retailing. Last month Lewis revealed a remarkable statistic: between 2007 and 2014 Tesco opened 35m sq ft of shop space \u2013 that\u2019s twice the size of all Asda\u2019s outlets \u2013 yet lost market share. That says everything about the scale of the challenge facing Tesco\u2019s boss. The company\u2019s Christmas sales figures will also be dragged down by the bounce it enjoyed last year on the back of Lewis taking over. The new Tesco boss boosted the morale of staff and issued \u00a35-off vouchers for customers spending \u00a340. However, Lewis has already warned that that won\u2019t be repeated this year and had admitted that trading will be tough. Asda On the basis of sales figures, Asda is also having a terrible time. The retailer reported a 4.5% fall in sales in established stores in the third quarter of the year. Asda is unlikely to be able to reverse that downward trend in time for Christmas. However, Asda, or at least its American bosses at Walmart, are focusing on protecting profits. This has meant that Asda has been able to maintain them despite the fall in sales, by not issuing money-off vouchers or running extra promotions for shoppers. This clearest demonstration of this strategy came when Asda pulled out of Black Friday and pledged to invest in cutting the price of everyday groceries instead. That decision seems to have boosted the confidence of boss Andy Clarke, whose future at Asda has been the subject of speculation, and could help its sales recover slightly for Christmas. Sainsbury\u2019s Sainsbury\u2019s is well-placed to emerge as the leader among the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets at Christmas. In fact, it would be a surprise if it did not report the strongest performance when the companies all reveal their trading results in January. Under Mike Coupe, who replaced Justin King as boss last year, the company has focused on the basics of retailing, such as product availability and emphasising the quality of its food compared with that of rivals. This positioning of the brand as an upmarket alternative to Tesco pays off for Sainsbury\u2019s during the holiday season as shoppers turn to its stores when looking for party food and fresh meat. This year, Sainsbury\u2019s has a couple of other factors in its favour. Its Mog the cat Christmas advert has proved extraordinarily popular, winning more views on YouTube than the John Lewis Christmas advert. The Sainsbury\u2019s advert has been watched more than 25 million times so far. The other factor in Sainsbury\u2019s favour is that its performance last Christmas was dragged down by the controversial decision, just weeks before Christmas, to halve the number of points it awarded to holders of its Nectar loyalty card. As a result, the comparative for the company\u2019s sales this year will be easier than it might have been. Morrisons The Bradford-based supermarket chain is the unknown quantity this Christmas. David Potts is leading the retailer into the festive period for the first time and is working hard, through price cuts and promotions, to get Morrisons back on track. However, the latest market share figures shows the company\u2019s sales are still falling after three years of decline. This is partly because Morrisons has sold off its convenience store chain, M Local, but the retailer is also struggling to find its place in a crowded market. Potts and chairman Andy Higginson are highly regarded for their work in senior roles at Tesco, but Morrisons is under pressure in its northern heartland from Aldi and Lidl. The discounters Aldi and Lidl\u2019s relentless growth continues apace. The only difference this year is that Lidl is now growing faster than Aldi. With the German chains looking to double in size over the next decade while the \u201cbig four\u201d close stores and scrap planned new developments, they will continue to grab market share. The biggest threat to their expansion is arguably themselves. Last year there were murmurings of discontent among some Aldi and Lidl shoppers because the shops were so busy at Christmas. This could play into the hands of the \u201cbig four\u201d if consumers decide they would rather avoid the queues and shop at a larger supermarket instead. However, for Aldi and Lidl, this is a nice problem to have. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said Aldi and Lidl were enjoying a \u201csecond wind\u201d of growth in the UK. \u201cWith the greater focus these limited-assortment discounters are putting on new store development in London and the south and east of England,\u201d he said, \u201cSainsbury\u2019s in particular \u2013 and Tesco \u2013 may need to spend a little more time reflecting on the competitive dynamics of the segment beyond its own northern trial with Netto.\u201d Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose Just as they have all year, the high-end players in the grocery market will join the price-cutters in emerging as the winners of the Christmas period. \u201cI don\u2019t see things changing much,\u201d Black says. \u201cThe bigger winners look like being the discounters and premium retailers, M&amp;S food is flying.\u201d There are plenty of British shoppers who, this Christmas, will buy bits and bobs from the discounters and then head to M&amp;S or Waitrose for their turkey and fresh food. This combination is putting the \u201cbig four\u201d under enormous strain, and will mean that while Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons are fighting their own battle, the performance of Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl will be in another league. M&amp;S and Waitrose have thrived by developing their own-brand products and introducing innovative new lines. This means that they are shielded from the price war that is taking place on branded goods. However, the two companies may see their growth slow compared with the previous year because of fierce competition in the market and the deflation caused by falling commodity prices. There are also concerns that Waitrose may have overstretched itself by opening too many new stores. However, the retailer, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership, is unlikely to be the Christmas turkey this year. Tesco could turn out to be the biggest loser, despite its efforts in Carlisle.",

      "bodyText": "Louis Wery, who helps manufacture bathtubs, joined 2,000 other union members on Thursday in returning to work for the Kohler Company \u2013 a leading producer of sinks, tubs and toilets \u2013 after a 32-day strike that focused on one of the most contentious issues in labor today: two-tier contracts. Wery, a Kohler employee for 42 years, attacked Kohler\u2019s demand to keep its two-tier pay system, saying such contracts are grossly unfair because they often pay new workers far less. \u201cAren\u2019t young people who work alongside me supposed to be treated the same, aren\u2019t we supposed to be equal?\u201d said Wery, a top-tier \u201ctub grinder\u201d who earns more than $25 an hour. Before the strike began on 15 November, Kohler, with 48 factories and 30,000 employees worldwide, threatened to move many of the production jobs from its headquarters city here, 57 miles north of Milwaukee, if it were forced to end its two-tier contract. \u201cThis site remains the company\u2019s highest-cost manufacturing location in the world,\u201d David Kohler, chief executive officer of the 142-year-old, privately held company, wrote in local newspaper, the Sheboygan Press. \u201cWe can no longer be cost-competitive from this location at the (top tier) Tier A wage level. If the two-tier wage disappears, so do the local manufacturing jobs.\u201d Before walking out, the workers voted overwhelmingly \u2013 by a 94% majority \u2013 to authorize a strike and reject Kohler\u2019s demand to keep its two-tier contract. Kohler first pressured the United Auto Workers into accepting a two-tier contract in 2010, when Kohler\u2019s business was ailing because of the Great Recession and weak housing market. Not only did the UAW agree to a new, lower tier that earned 35% less on average than top-tier workers, but it also accepted a five-year wage freeze. Tim Tayloe, president of UAW Local 833, said it was inexcusable that some lower-tier workers still earn just $11.50 an hour. The union says Tier A workers average $22.50 an hour, but Kohler says $23.45. After a month of picketing, often in rain or cold, the workers voted late Wednesday to approve a new contract even though it retains two tiers. Tayloe told the workers, gathered in a high school auditorium for the vote, that the deal was far better for the Tier B workers than the original, rejected offer. The minimum pay for virtually all Tier B workers, he said, will rise to $15 an hour \u2013 a few will earn $14.70 \u2013 and while he had to swallow a continued two tier, he said the new contract achieves a vital goal. \u201cNow everyone will be receiving a livable wage,\u201d he said. \u201cOne worker was earning so little he was living in his car. If you have a job like this, you shouldn\u2019t be making $11.50 an hour.\u201d Tayloe added that under the new contract, some lower-tier workers will earn $19 to $21 an hour, as much as some top-tier workers. According to Tayloe, the average raise for the Tier B workers will be $4.70 an hour spread over four years \u2013 which translates into a 37% raise, according to the union. The UAW. says the nearly 400 lower-tier workers average $12.50 an hour, while Kohler says they average $14.69 (although statistics on a company website show they average $12.70). The top-tier workers will receive raises of 50 cents a year for four years, and many will receive one-time payments of $2,000. Tayloe said the improved deal means $7m more in wages over four years than the rejected offer. Judging from the mood at the Wednesday night ratification vote, the workers were feeling good about the settlement. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot better than it was, but I\u2019m sorry the two-tier is still there,\u201d said Antonio Spearman, a Tier B foundry operator, who added that he was glad he would soon receive a $3-an-hour raise. Bruce Pahl, a Kohler foundry worker since 1973, also voted to approve, saying he was happy to battle for the younger workers. \u201cWe\u2019re like a big family,\u201d Pahl said. \u201cThey gave more to the young people. Now they have an opportunity to climb up the ladder and move up. I think it\u2019s going to be a very Merry Christmas for everybody here.\u201d Crystal McDonald, another bottom-tier worker, applauded the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant raise, although it would be good if other things could be addressed.\u201d She sounded less worried than some other workers about David Kohler\u2019s threat to move jobs. \u201cThey have invested too much money into the plant,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019d never move it. People didn\u2019t buy it.\u201d Among the workers, there was a strong sense that their sticking together along with robust community support had forced Kohler to bend more than it had intended \u2013 even as they recognized that Kohler had dug in on retaining the two tiers. \u201cI think Kohler was shocked by the 94% who backed the strike\u201d Tayloe said. \u201cI think they thought that Tier A would fold, would not stand up for the Tier B workers.\u201d After the ratification vote, the company issued a statement: \u201cKohler Co maintains a competitive wage structure that is essential for our Wisconsin facility to grow jobs going forward. Most important, we welcome our associates back to work, where together, we will continue to work hard to exceed our customers\u2019 expectations.\u201d Inside his UAW office on Thursday, Tayloe looked exhausted, with dozens of workers dropping in to pick up their $200-a-week check for strike pay. They had to navigate their way around hundreds of toys on the floor \u2013 Star Wars Monopoly, Good Kids dolls, Monster Treads Wheelie Tractors \u2013 that had been donated for the strikers\u2019 children. On Wednesday, 219 strikers went to the food bank at the union hall (again formed from donations) to pick up essentials to feed their families. Some days the union had more than 1,000 strikers march and picket. Their signs included, \u201cEquality \u2013 Tier- B Lives Matter\u201d, and \u201cHey, Kohler, Your Offer Doesn\u2019t Hold Water.\u201d Tayloe said he was pleased that only around 30 of the 2,000 workers crossed the picket line. Inside the UAW hall were flyers with the names of those who crossed, saying \u201cNo Longer Our Union Brothers or Sisters. A scab is a scab. Don\u2019t be afraid to point them out.\u201d Kohler has a notorious labor history. In 1934, after workers went on strike to seek to replace the company-supported union, the walkout turned violent. The strikers turned back a coal car, and in the ensuing battle, two strikers were killed and 40 injured. In 1954, after 2,800 of the 3,300 Kohler workers here walked out, Kohler brought in replacement workers and the strike lasted six years. The dispute only ended when the National Labor Relations Board ruled in 1960 that Kohler had refused to bargain in good faith. It ordered Kohler to pay $3m in back wages and reinstate 1,700 workers. Outside Tayloe\u2019s office is a blown-up photograph of that $3m check. On his desk is an elaborate scrapbook with news stories about the 16-day strike of 1983. \u201cThey used the same tactics as in the last strike, threatening to move jobs,\u201d Tayloe said. After governor Scott Walker pushed through legislation in 2011 to cripple the state\u2019s public-employee unions \u2013 and defied a huge labor protest in doing so \u2013 Wisconsin\u2019s unions have worked hard to support each other. The carpenters union donated $42,000 to the Kohler strikers, while the teachers union donated several thousand dollars and often dropped off hot chili to the picket lines. The Texas Roadhouse restaurant donated many meals, while friends in the community repeatedly dropped of hot chocolate, coffee and donuts. Many also donated wood to sustain the burn barrels \u2013 the 42-gallon metal drums filled with firewood to keep the picketers warm. \u201cThe whole labor movement has backed these brave Kohler workers,\u201d said Stephanie Bloomingdale, secretary-treasurer of the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of solidarity: \u2018We\u2019re family. This is our fight.\u2019 \u201d The Kohler workers were mindful of the UAW\u2019s recent negotiating battle with General Motors, Ford and Fiat-Chrysler. Rank-and-file autoworkers were eager to end their two-tier contracts with the Detroit Three, and after the Fiat-Chrysler deal was initially voted down, the union got the three automakers to agree to phase out the two tiers over eight years. \u201cFor the UAW, unless you make some significant improvement in the wage gap between Tier A and Tier B, it\u2019s a deal breaker,\u201d said Robert Bruno, professor of labor studies at the University of Illinois, Chicago \u201cUntil you manage to do that, you were going to be between a rock and a hard place. If you can make significant improvements in narrowing the gap and the company can afford it, that\u2019s the sweet spot. And here, it looks as if they hit the sweet spot and both sides can walk away and feel they did right.\u201d The union\u2019s solidarity and the community\u2019s strong backing, Bruno said, helped push Kohler to reach that sweet spot.",
