      "bodyText": "Small and medium-sized building firms are struggling to find land where they can build homes, research showed on Tuesday, with a lack of available sites preventing the creation of much-needed new homes in England. For the second year running, the Federation of Master Builders (FMB) found that the lack of available and viable land was the biggest barrier to building for SMEs in the industry, with two-thirds citing it as a problem. In the 1980s, around two-thirds of new homes were built by small firms, but their contribution has now dropped to around a quarter, with the financial crisis speeding up the decline. The federation said its annual survey showed land availability was the biggest constraint on supply, followed by lack of finance and then planning permission. The percentage of respondents citing a shortage of skilled workers as a major barrier to growth was up sharply, rising to 39% from 27% in 2015. The organisation said that local authorities were focusing too much on large developments when drawing up their local plans, rather than including provisions for smaller building firms. The small sites that developers were able to identify were often harder to get through the planning process, it said, and without large in-house teams to help, builders struggled. Brian Berry, the chief executive of the FMB, said: \u201cCouncils need to find a way of allocating and granting planning permission for more small sites. The current focus on large sites is squeezing out smaller developers, which is reducing competition in the housing market at a time when we need more, not less, choice. \u201cThe limited supply of opportunities for small-scale development is one of a number of key structural constraints that has seen the number of homes built by SMEs decline from around two-thirds in the late 1980s to less than a quarter today.\u201d Berry said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d that the planning system treated a 300-home application in largely the same way it treated a three-home application. He added: \u201cSME house builders must be seen as a key component of the government\u2019s housing strategy. This means a renewed focus on granting planning permission to small sites. At the same time, the government needs to press ahead with its proposed planning reforms, including a presumption in favour of small-scale development.\u201d The FMB said the 108 firms responding to its survey had reported that demand from buyers had weakened over the past year, but that they expected it to pick up again over the next 12 months. On Monday, the Home Builders Federation said official figures for the number of new homes were undercounting by around 30,000 a year. Its Ghost Towns report said the government\u2019s quarterly and annual housebuilding statistics reports missed out an average of 153 homes completed in 75% of local authorities. It said the annual net supply of housing data, which was only published once a year, was drawn from more reliable sources and showed a 20% increase in new homes in 2014-15.",

      "bodyText": "Pre-EU referendum jitters have caused a slump in the number of shops opening their doors, according to a biannual report monitoring vacancy rates on the UK high street. Shop closures outstripped openings by 1,997 from January to the end of June, according to the retail data firm Local Data Company. Although the number of closures was down by 5% to 22,801, openings tumbled 15% to 20,804, reversing the trend seen in the second half of 2015, when there were 335 more openings than closures. The John Lewis Partnership is among the major names to have scaled back expansion, saying last week that it had abandoned plans to open seven new Waitrose supermarkets. Vacancy rates \u2013 the number of retail sites standing empty \u2013 began to rise at the end of June after declining steadily since early 2012. Matthew Hopkinson, the director of LDC, said: \u201cGrowth slackened significantly in the half year leading up to the referendum at the end of June, taking the steam out of the gentle improvement in vacancy. Since the end of June we have seen the vacancy rate in leisure outlets inch upwards.\u201d Hopkinson predicted that some retailers would not survive as the weakness of sterling forces up costs, squeezing shops already battling each other for a share of customers\u2019 wallets. \u201cIncreased costs for retailers coupled with fierce competition and oversupply of shops is likely to see increased levels of distress and failure among retailers, with survival of the fittest being the order of the day,\u201d he said. His warning comes after figures for August from the British Retail Consortium and Springboard showed retailers underperforming the rest of the high street. There were 0.1% more visitors to the high street than there were in August 2015, according to the survey, but this was attributed to people visiting restaurants and other nightlife venues. Retail sales fell during the period, with the number of visitors to shopping centres down 1.9%. The LDC report, based on visits to 2,700 towns and cities, exposed a gulf between the towns with the most vacant shops and those with the fewest. Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire had no empty shops, while a third of those in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, had no occupant. The north-east is the region with the highest percentage of long-term vacant units, LDC said, while vacancy rates were higher in Wales, at 15.1%, than in Scotland, at 12.1%, and England with 11.3%.",

HMRC has started legal proceedings against the disgraced businessman to try to recover the money. However, Chappell has put the business that owes the tax, Swiss Rock Limited, into liquidation, meaning he could walk away without paying the bill. Swiss Rock owes \u00a3365,000 in VAT and \u00a3196,306 in corporation tax, according to documents drawn up by Chappell and David Rubin &amp; Partners, which has been appointed as liquidator. The company is also listed as owing \u00a356,000 in \u201ctrade and expense\u201d and \u00a315,000 to Chappell from a loan account. It has debts with Cornhill Capital, the City firm that advised Chappell before his purchase of BHS, but the amount is recorded as disputed. Swiss Rock is Chappell\u2019s personal business and was paid at least \u00a31.6m by BHS as part of his controversial acquisition of the department store chain. In total, the consortium led by Chappell that bought BHS, Retail Acquisitions, received at least \u00a317m from the retailer despite owning it for just 13 months before it failed. The revelation of Chappell\u2019s unpaid tax bill will further infuriate the 11,000 BHS staff who have lost their jobs and face a cut to their retirement benefits. The last of BHS\u2019s 164 stores closed last month after it collapsed into administration in April. In July, Chappell and his associates were labelled as \u201cincompetent and self-serving\u201d by a parliamentary committee investigating the failure of BHS. MPs accused Chappell of having \u201chad his fingers in the till\u201d and helping oversee the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of the business. Chappell declined to comment. Last month he confirmed to the Guardian that Swiss Rock would enter insolvency proceedings but said it was because he is no longer using the company. The Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator are investigating Chappell, while the Serious Fraud Office is considering whether to launch a formal investigation. HMRC does not comment on individual cases but said its aim is to \u201cefficiently collect the debts due and to prevent things deteriorating further\u201d. It filed a petition at the high court to wind up Swiss Rock before Chappell liquidated the company. Chappell bought BHS for \u00a31 from Sir Philip Green in March 2013. Green is in talks with the Pensions Regulator about a deal to bail out the BHS pension scheme, which has a deficit of \u00a3571m. The tycoon, his family and other BHS investors collected more than \u00a3580m from the company during the 15 years he ran it. Green told MPs in June he would \u201csort\u201d the pension deficit. However, he is yet to secure an agreement, despite pressure from MPs such as Frank Field, who has said Green should be stripped of his knighthood if he does not pump money into the pension scheme.",

      "bodyText": "Over in Greece the government is once again in a race against the clock to implement reforms that will unlock further bailout funds. After the tense restart of talks with visiting inspectors last week, officials are promising to placate creditors with an omnibus bill detailing new measures this week. Helena Smith reports from Athens: With its popularity plummeting in the polls, Greece\u2019s leftist-led government is keen to use the resumption of talks with lenders to good effect. Long and short, that means debt relief and putting discussion of it on the table. To get there Athens needs to complete the current round of prior actions, or milestone reforms, it failed to deal with over the summer. Upon them not only rests the next installment of bailout aid \u2013 at \u20ac2.8bn critical for the debt-wracked economy - but the onset of official debate over what to do about Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt load, at 180% of national output by far the highest in the eurozone. \u201cThe idea is to push the multi-bill with all these measures through parliament this week,\u201d said one well-placed source. Among the measures will be the appointment of a supervisory board for the country\u2019s new privatisation fund - an issue Athens has rowed about vociferously with creditors \u2013 and the formal inclusion of several loss-making public entities in the body. With Greece\u2019s debt-repayment timetable far from pressing, creditors - though peaved with the slow pace of reforms - are not piling on the pressure. Instead it is the government, that feeling the pinch of public hostility, is now keen to move on to the next step of passing the reforms so the Euro Working Group can agree to disburse the aid when it next meets on September 29. If that goal is achieved, the hope is the next bailout review will begin on October 17 \u2013 and with it the much anticipated issue of debt forgiveness. Addressing his Syriza party\u2019s central committee over the weekend, prime minister Alexis Tsipras insisted \u201cthere will be developments on the debt issue soon.\u201d On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. With a recovery in oil prices and hopes that the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates on hold on Wednesday, stock markets have begun the week on an upbeat note. A weaker dollar helped lift commodity companies, with mining companies making up five on the top ten riser on the FTSE 100 index. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 103.27 points or 1.54% at 6813.55 Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 0.95% to 10,373.87 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.43% higher at 4394.19 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.28% to 16,399.26 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.95% at 8715.5 But in Greece, the Athens market edged 0.36% lower to 557.47 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 75 points or 0.4%. Analysts are wondering whether the markets can build on today\u2019s gains ahead of the Bank of Japan and Federal Reserve meetings, or whether we are in for more volatility until the outcome of the latest central bank deliberations is known. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Monday has seen stock markets march higher in lockstep, with healthy gains across the board. The FTSE\u2019s mining and oil firms have taken the space afforded by a weaker dollar to move strongly higher, and while the index appears to be slipping back as the session winds down, it looks like buyers are returning in large numbers. Today of course is the calm before the storm, as everyone gears up for the BoJ and Fed decisions on Wednesday, so we can expect to see risk appetite more severely tested in the coming 48 hours, but for now bearish thoughts have been banished. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was little new to work with this afternoon, the markets continuing to climb on the hopes of Fed inaction on Wednesday. While not quite as excited as its European peers, the Dow Jones nevertheless posted some solid growth this Monday... The dollar, on the other hand, spent the day falling from the levels it struck last Friday; against the pound it lost more than half a percent, while it shed 0.3% against the euro. In a remarkably stable showing the European indices didn\u2019t veer from their opening growth this Monday. The FTSE [trickled] over the 6800 mark as the index benefited from both the lack of rate hike likelihood in the US and the gains made by Brent Crude following this morning\u2019s rumours of an OPEC/non-OPEC deal. The Eurozone indices saw similar performances for most of the same reasons as the UK index, the DAX and CAC seeing 1% and 1.5% increases respectively It will be interesting to see if this momentum can continue to build tomorrow, or whether a) any pre-Fed jitters will set in as September\u2019s meeting grows ever closer or, related, b) the lack of data on Tuesday will cause investors with too much time on their hands to doubt the decisions they made this Monday. Elsewhere gold remains a haven in troubled times, not least for central banks. Phillip Inman writes: Central banks have boosted their gold stocks by almost 10% since the financial crash, reflecting its renewed attractiveness as a safe haven in an environment of uncertainty and low or negative interest rates. China and Russia have led the switch to gold away from foreign currencies, especially the US dollar, to shore up their reserves. Western nations, including the UK, have halted several decades of mass sell-offs. According to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), central banks have swooped on the gold markets every year since 2008 to become net bullion buyers, adding more than 2,800 tonnes, or 9.4%, to reserves. Britain has one of the smallest holdings of gold in the G7 at 0.9% in 2016 while the US has the largest after increasing its share from 24.5% to 24.8% between 2000 and 2016. In 1980, the US had 44.1% of all gold stocks and 75.7% in 1940. \u201cDeveloped countries [accounting for the lion\u2019s share of total official holdings] have been conserving stocks, while developing countries led by China and Russia have been building them up. \u201cThis is the longest protracted spell of gold accruals since 1950-65, when central banks and treasuries acquired a net total of more than 7,000 tonnes during the economic recovery after the second world war,\u201d said David Marsh, the director of OMFIF. The full story is here: Meanwhile, here are the odds on the US Federal Reserve raising rates on Wednesday: Ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting come stronger than expected US housing figures. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo housing market index came in at 65 in September compared to forecasts of a level of 60. August\u2019s figure of 60 was revised downwards marginally to 59. NAHB chairman Ed Brady said: As household incomes rise, builders in many markets across the nation are reporting they are seeing more serious buyers, a positive sign that the housing market continues to move forward. The single-family market continues to make gradual gains and we expect this upward momentum will build throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017. The rise in global markets continues in the US, ahead of the latest interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. A recovery in the oil price after Venezuela suggested that producers meeting at the end of the month might agree action to curb the slump in crude has also helped lift shares. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 90 points or 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both opened up around 0.3%. The dollar continues to weaken, on the growing expectation that the US Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates this week. The euro has hit a day\u2019s high of $1.1176 against the US currency while the pound is up 0.62% at $1.3078. As it\u2019s quiet, let\u2019s trawl through some of the charts doing the rounds in the City today. This one shows how imposing negative interest rates can backfire, as it forces investors to take their money overseas: A new report from Bank of International Settlements (the \u201ccentral banks\u2019 main organisation) has also got chart-fans excited. BIS is very worried that China is on the brink of a banking crisis, as its credit boom has soared to new heights. China\u2019s \u201ccredit to GDP gap\u201d is now 30.1 \u2013 a level that has historically proved to be bad news (as in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis) BIS also flag up that inflation is looking rare, despite the huge expansion in central bank balance sheets and record low interest rates. And UK banks are a particular concern, after spending years dealing with bad debts and paying fines for misconduct. The US stock market is expected to open a little higher in an hour\u2019s time, following the solid rally in Europe. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called up around 0.6%: Franck Dixmier, Global Head of Fixed Income at Allianz Global Investors, reckons America\u2019s central bankers won\u2019t be able to keep interest rates on hold for much longer. With core inflation contained well below the US Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 per cent target level, the Fed has so far felt no sense of urgency to raise interest rates. Nevertheless, given the now almost-full level of employment in the US economy, it will be increasingly difficult for the Fed to maintain the status quo. With investors\u2019 risk appetites coming back during the summer, the arguments that the Fed used in June and July to do nothing \u2013 citing external risks to growth and questionable financial stability linked to Brexit \u2013 are no longer valid. From now on, the Fed is much more likely to focus on domestic economic developments, and those indicators have been growing stronger. Nevertheless, this monetary policy normalization cycle will probably be very different from the ones we have seen in the past. This tells us to expect only very gradual and moderate hikes. The Fed will also be particularly keen to keep its policy decisions from having any negative effect on US economic growth and financial stability. I suggested earlier that the Bank of Japan was unlikely to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory on Wednesday\u2019s meeting. Masaaki Kanno of JPMorgan Securities Japan doesn\u2019t agree, saying \u201cWe think that the BOJ will likely cut the rate to negative 30 basis points from negative 10 basis points.\u201d He also expects the Bank of Japan to boost its quantitative easing programme, and aim to expand the Japanese monetary base even wider. Other analysts, though, are still plumping for \u2018no change\u2019 from the BoJ. As Mike Bird of the WSJ points out, there\u2019s more uncertainty than usual... Europe\u2019s builders had a cracking July, according to a new report today. Construction output across the EU jumped by 1,8% during the month, according to Eurostat -- the biggest monthly rise since January. On an annual basis, construction output was 3.1% higher than a year ago. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: Building activity was particularly strong in July, rising 2.2% month-on-month and 3.2% year-on-year. Civil engineering output was up a lesser 0.4% month-on-month, although it was up 2.9% year-on-year. Economist Rupert Seggins has provided more context too: The City is bracing itself for the possibility that it will lose its prized \u2018passporting\u2019 rights if Britain leaves the European single market. Passporting allows a bank to base itself in one EU country and offer services across the bloc. It\u2019s thus extremely useful for London-based investment banks, asset managers and the like, who don\u2019t need to be licenced in individual European countries. Now, Germany\u2019s top central banker, Jens Weidmann, has fired a warning shot at London that passporting rights will be lost if Britain goes for a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit. Weidmann told the Guardian that: ...passporting rights are tied to the single market and would automatically cease to apply if Great Britain is no longer at least part of the European Economic Area\u201d (EEA). That implies that City firms would have to moves sales offices, trading desks and middle office jobs into another EU country; time-consuming, expensive, and a blow to the UK capital. Rating agency Moody\u2019s is more optimistic, though. In a new report, it suggests that losing passporting rights would \u201clikely be manageable for most UK-based financial firms\u201d. That\u2019s because Moody\u2019s believes other legislation would allow London-based firms to sell banking services into the EU even if Britain left the single market. Simon Ainsworth, Senior Vice President at Moody\u2019s, says: \u201cIn particular, we consider that the third country equivalence provisions contained within the incoming MIFID 2 EU directive may provide firms with an alternative means of accessing the single market. The complexity of (quickly) unwinding the status quo and a desire to minimise the initial impact on European domiciled banks will likely lead to the preservation of most cross-border rights to undertake business.\u201d But there\u2019s a snag..... that \u201cthird country equivalence\u201d relies on a judgement from the European Commission. So there\u2019s no escape from uncertainty on this issue, so some banks may simply decide to play it safe and move over the Channel... The FTSE 250 index of smaller, largely-UK focused companies isn\u2019t joining in today\u2019s rally. It\u2019s broadly flat today, dragged down by Mitie\u2019s slump (still down 25%). Australia\u2019s stock market endured a chaotic day, after a technical glitch scuppered normal trading. Things got off to a bad start, with the ASX opening 90 minutes late. Once it puffed into life, some stocks weren\u2019t trading -- and after three hours, it crashed again and stayed down for good. ASX chief executive Dominic Stevens has apologised, and denied that hackers were responsible. He blames a hardware failure that afflicted that ASX database, as \u201cThis had a number of knock-on consequences that affected the operation of the market. The issues were not in any way related to cyber security.\u201d Traders reckon that volumes were 80% lower than usual, meaning around $3.5bn of business was lost. Fingers crossed that the problems don\u2019t reoccur on Tuesday... Zing! The FTSE 100 index has now jumped by 100 points as this morning\u2019s rally sends the index to a 10-day high. Investors are piling into shares ahead of this week\u2019s central bank meetings, and betting that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t shock us with a rate hike on Wednesday. Nearly every share is up -- mining stocks continue to be lifted by the weak dollar, while banks and supermarkets are also in demand. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the City is getting ready for Wednesday\u2019s \u201ccentral bank fest\u201d: European stock markets are starting the foot in a buoyant mood, with the fear of a US rate hike fading with every disappointing data point. Triple digit gains for the FTSE within an otherwise unremarkable day goes to highlight the fact that we are seeing substantial speculation over future events, with Wednesday\u2019s BoJ, FOMC and RBNZ bonanza a likely driving force behind today\u2019s moves. Once more it has proven prudent to buy the dips in the FTSE, which has shaken off fears of a sharp selloff to push into a 10 day high today. [that\u2019s the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand]. Britain\u2019s financial watchdog, the FCA, is continuing to clean up Britain\u2019s payday lending market. Today, CFO Lending is in the doghouse for overcharging customers, sending them threatening letters, and not providing help to people who couldn\u2019t repay their loans. Mitie\u2019s profits warning highlights how the EU referendum prompted some UK companies to slash their spending on outsourced services. City firm Canaccord Genuity explain: Mitie\u2019s interim trading update this morning reflects the impact of significant uncertainty around client project spend given economic pressures in the period leading up to and following the result of the EU referendum in the Group\u2019s first half from April to September. These wider market pressures have served to be an unwelcome additional challenge to spend given the pressures already facing the Group\u2019s clients which have absorbed material labour costs, and as a result, contract cost inflation on the back of working through the impact of the National Living Wage introduction in April. Shares in outsourcing firm Mitie are tumbling this morning, after it warned that the Brexit vote was hurting its business. In a statement to the City, Mitie warned that earnings this year will be \u201cmaterially\u201d below expectations. It blamed \u201cuncertainty\u201d before and after the EU referendum, along with \u201clower UK growth rates, changes to labour legislation and further public sector budget constraints\u201d. This has sent Mitie\u2019s shares down by 25% this morning, to a five-year low. Mitie offers a wide range of outsourcing services, from facilities management and cleaning services to pest control. It also runs Immigration Removal Centres for the Home Office. Many clients cut back earlier this year, ahead of the referendum, and that business hasn\u2019t returned since.... Here\u2019s the full story: Brexit uncertainty is hurting companies, according to the latest healthcheck on Britain\u2019s business. Business confidence hit a four-year low, Lloyds Bank reports this morning, amid rising concerns over economic uncertainty and a slowdown in demand following the EU referendum result. Expectations that sales, orders and profits will grow over the next six months slipped to 12%, down from 38% in January. Other economic data has been more upbeat recently; unemployment fell in the last quarter, and retail sales have help up well. Businesses, though, are clearly edgy. The oil price is on a small charge this morning, helped by the latest rumours of a potential deal between producers. Brent crude has gained 1.3% this morning to $46.36, after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told reporters that: \u201cWe are close to an agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to stabilize the market.\u201d State oil company Petroleos de Venezuel tweeted the comments here: We\u2019ve been here before, of course, only to see deadlock between Saudi Arabia and Iran scupper any deal. Violence at two ports in Libya have also pushed the oil price higher, as Marketwatch explains: The Petroleum Facilities Guards, a militia that until this month had controlled Libya\u2019s oil ports for years after the 2011 ouster and death of dictator Moammar Gadhafi, briefly retook two oil ports, Sidra and Ras Lanuf, in the country\u2019s central coast on Saturday night, militia members said. Shares are rallying in London at the start of trading, sending the blue-chip FTSE 100 up by 66 points to 6776. Mining shares are leading the way, with Glencore jumping 2.9%, Anglo American gaining 2.7% and BHP Billiton up by 2.5%. They\u2019re benefitting from a drop in the dollar this morning, which has pushed up commodity prices. A weaker dollar shows that investors expect the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates on hold on Wednesday night. Most Asian stock markets have gained ground today. China\u2019s market rose by 0.65%, the Hong Kong market jumped by almost 1%, and South Korea is up by around 0.9%. Japan, though, was closed for a public holiday, giving Tokyo a break before Wednesday\u2019s BoJ excitement. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s an autumnal feel in the City this morning, with the cloudy skies neatly matching the feel in the markets right now. Investors have a lot to ponder as they arrive at their desks today, with two crucial central bank meetings this week. Tomorrow, the Bank of Japan begins a two-day policy meeting, where it could make important to changes to its stimulus programme, in yet another attempt to weaken the yen and push up inflation and growth. BoJ governor Kuroda will also reveal the results of the central bank\u2019s review of its own stimulus programme, amid talk that central banks are running out of firepower. The BoJ has been on the back food since stunning the markets by imposing negative interest rates earlier this year - a gamble that doesn\u2019t seem to have delivered the goods. They could potentially cut rates again (but this seems unlikely). Alternatively, they could change their bond-buying programme -- buying less long-dated bonds, to push up the yield curve. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains the BoJ\u2019s plight: The BOJ has struggled ever since their surprise decision to cut rates into negative territory backfired at the end of January. In that regard, they followed the path of the Chinese authorities whose decision over a year ago to let the yuan weaken backfired equally spectacularly, and the Swiss National Bank, whose decision to remove the EUR/CHF floor at 1.20 did nothing to ease reserve accumulation, nothing to boost capital outflows and nothing to fight deflation. But they\u2019re the lucky ones, as the economy appears to have weathered the strong currency relatively well over the last 18 months.... I think there\u2019s a really good case for the BOJ to grasp the nettle and ease again, to drive real yields down as inflation expectations rise. Thousands of miles away from Tokyo, the US Federal Reserve will hold its own policy meeting on Wednesday. The issue for the Fed is whether it\u2019s safe to risk raising US interest rates for the first time this year. The US inflation rate did pick up in August, to 1.1%, giving Fed hawks some reason to hike. But other economic data has been gloomier, with industrial production shrinking last month So if the American economy is slowing down, a rate hike now might be a serious blunder (although it would give the Fed the wriggle room to cut borrowing costs next year....). Few in the markets really expect the Fed to raise rates at this month\u2019s meeting, from the near current low of 0.25%-0.5%. But that means that traders can spend the next few days worrying that they\u2019re wrong.... FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed reckons we could get the classic \u2018hawkish hold\u2019 -- with the Fed getting investors ready for a hike before Christmas: The market shares our view with only 12% priced in for a rate hike according to CME FedWatch, suggesting that investors are not well prepared for action, and even a dovish rate hike will create serious headwinds to financial markets. However, I believe that Janet Yellen will take the opportunity to start building the case for a December rate hike, which could continue sending the dollar higher. Also coming up this morning... The oil price is pushing up, thanks to chatter that the OPEC cartel might agree some steps to stabilise the market (more on this shortly). Investors will also be watching Germany closely, after Angela Merkel\u2019s party lost seats in Berlin elections over the weekend. The anti-euro, anti-migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party made gains, raising questions over whether the old order in Germany is being rattled.",

      "bodyText": "Fears that the UK would see a mass exodus of banks in the event of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d have been downplayed by one of the world\u2019s three big rating agencies in a report that says the impact on the City would be modest and manageable. An analysis by Moody\u2019s said there would be a loss of business if the referendum result leads to Britain leaving the single market as well as the EU, but the impact would be less serious than some experts have suggested. The report was published as Theresa May met the leaders of US multinationals \u2013 including Wall Street firms with major UK operations such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2013 in an attempt to assuage their anxieties over the impact of the 23 June vote on their businesses. The future of the financial sector will be vital in the Brexit negotiations, with the government eager to prevent multinational banks from leaving for other EU destinations. Since the vote, there have been concerns that a departure from the single market will result in the loss of passporting rights \u2013 the array of permissions granted to London-based banks and other financial companies, which allow them to operate across the EU and the wider European Economic Area (EEA). Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, said in a Guardian interview that without passporting rights London\u2019s position as a financial centre would be jeopardised. But Moody\u2019s said the direct impact on the banks and financial services companies for which it provided ratings was \u201clikely to be modest\u201d. It added: \u201cThe greater impact would be felt through higher costs and diversion of management attention, as the companies concerned restructure, reducing profitability for a time. This is credit negative but manageable. And other critical factors such as capital and liquidity, which are largely determined by global standards, are unlikely to face material changes due to Brexit per se.\u201d Moody\u2019s said it thought it unlikely that all permissions granted to financial firms would be lost. Even without a formal arrangement, EU law already provides for limited recognition of non-EU regulatory regimes for the purpose of undertaking investment and banking business, it said. Simon Ainsworth, the senior vice-president at Moody\u2019s, said a scheme to harmonise regulations across the EU could provide an alternative way to access the single market. \u201cThe complexity of (quickly) unwinding the status quo and a desire to minimise the initial impact on European domiciled banks will likely lead to the preservation of most cross-border rights to undertake business,\u201d said Ainsworth. Moody\u2019s added that there would be less certainty for firms as access would depend on a judgment by the European commission, which might take time to make and could be withdrawn later. Ainsworth said: \u201cWhile banks that use the UK as an entry point for most EU operations should not suffer materially altered credit fundamentals if they lost their EU passports, the uncertainty around the outcome of any new arrangements mean that it is likely that some banks may choose to move some UK-based activities to the EU before the UK\u2019s withdrawal negotiations are complete.\u201d Mark Boleat, the policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, said: \u201cPassporting is still a crucial issue for financial services firms and the uncertainty is causing real problems for some businesses. What exactly its loss would be depends on both the sector and business model of any company. \u201cIn the City many firms are still analysing what impact the loss of passporting will have on them. For some retail banks it is of almost no real importance. But for the whole of international investment banking and an institution such as Lloyds of London it is an absolute necessity. We are making this point clear to policymakers in our ongoing discussions.\u201d Weidmann said the \u201chard Brexit\u201d option would lead to banks being automatically stripped of their ability to conduct business across the EU and open the door for Frankfurt to take business away from London. He emphasised that banking \u201cpassporting rights are tied to the single market and would automatically cease to apply if Great Britain is no longer at least part of the EEA\u201d .",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Central banks have boosted their gold stocks by almost 10% since the financial crash, reflecting its renewed attractiveness as a safe haven in an environment of uncertainty and low or negative interest rates. China and Russia have led the switch to gold away from foreign currencies, especially the US dollar, to shore up their reserves. Western nations, including the UK, have halted several decades of mass sell-offs. According to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), central banks have swooped on the gold markets every year since 2008 to become net bullion buyers, adding more than 2,800 tonnes, or 9.4%, to reserves. Britain has one of the smallest holdings of gold in the G7 at 0.9% in 2016 while the US has the largest after increasing its share from 24.5% to 24.8% between 2000 and 2016. In 1980, the US had 44.1% of all gold stocks and 75.7% in 1940. \u201cDeveloped countries [accounting for the lion\u2019s share of total official holdings] have been conserving stocks, while developing countries led by China and Russia have been building them up. \u201cThis is the longest protracted spell of gold accruals since 1950-65, when central banks and treasuries acquired a net total of more than 7,000 tonnes during the economic recovery after the second world war,\u201d said David Marsh, the director of OMFIF. He said central banks were turning back to gold purchases in line with a century of practice between 1870 and 1970. \u201cThis has restored the yellow metal as a central element of monetary management.\u201d According to the World Gold Council there was a 15% jump in demand in the second quarter of the year as purchases by exchange-traded funds added to central bank purchases. \u201cIn fact, the gold price posted the strongest first half-yearly performance, up 25%, for more than 35 years,\u201d it said. The OMFIF report found that central bank purchases over the past eight years have returned to the 100-year average up to 1970 when annual net gold purchases were 350 tonnes a year. Marsh said gold had gone through seven stages since the early 19th century. A period of selling by central banks from the late 1990s juddered to a halt in 2008, but not before the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland had unloaded billions of pounds worth of the metal. Between July 1999 and March 2002, the Bank of England sold 395 tonnes of gold at an average price of $275.60 per troy ounce. It is estimated the UK lost about \u00a34bn after the price recovered to approximately $1,000 an ounce. Since 2008 it has been worth between $1,000 and $1,600. The sales were widely criticised at the time. The report said: \u201cCentral bank gold transactions have often been somewhat disassociated from the gold price.\u201d Central banks were net sellers during four decades of fluctuating but generally rising bullion prices from the early 1970s onwards. \u201cThe latest period since 2008 has been a time of sharp price swings in the $1,000 to $1,600 per ounce range, but the eight-year switch to central bank purchases appears to have been a factor behind the price recovery since 2015,\u201d the report said.",

      "bodyText": "Beleaguered dairy farmers in Britain are enjoying an increase in the price they receive for milk after suffering years of deflation. Dairy Crest, one of the biggest dairy companies in the UK, said there had been a \u201csudden\u201d increase in the price it pays for milk. The company said it has upped the price it pays farmers for milk by 12% since June while the price of cream has doubled. The comments from Dairy Crest, the owner of Cathedral City cheese and Clover margarine, are supported by official statistics. Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) show the average UK farm-gate price for milk rose 3.3% in July compared with June. However, the price of milk was still 13% down on a year earlier. Dairy farmers have endured three years of falling milk prices due to pressure from supermarkets to lower prices and falling overseas sales of British milk. The squeeze on the agricultural sector came to a head last summer when Aldi, Lidl, Asda and Morrisons were targeted by protesters who claimed they were paying less than the cost of production. Cows were paraded through the aisles of an Asda store in Stafford, in the West Midlands. The National Farmers Union said dairy producers were facing a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d after the price they were paid for milk fell by a quarter in a year. The slight uptick in prices in recent weeks has been driven by lower production levels from farms, with wet weather in June and hot weather in August playing a role, and an increase in demand. Dairy Crest has sold its milk business to M\u00fcller but remains a key customer for farmers because it produces Cathedral City, Clover and other dairy products. Ruth Askew, the head of procurement at Dairy Crest, said: \u201cOur farmers have been facing difficult conditions on farm as the whole industry has dealt with unprecedented deflation over the past 18 months. \u201cDuring this time we have worked hard to support our farmers by paying a fair, stable and competitive milk price.\u201d Shares in Dairy Crest fell by 4% after a trading update revealed the increase in the price of milk. Mark Allen, Dairy Crest\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis sudden cost inflation is likely to have an impact on butter volumes and margins in the second half.\u201d Despite this, Allen said sales were rising for its key brands. Cathedral City has been relaunched this year with new branding and marketing. Darren Shirley, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cWhilst we fully expect Dairy Crest to be a beneficiary of inflation in UK and global dairy prices over the medium term, in the short term we keep a cautionary eye on the UK cream price, which has more than doubled since May 2016, and which could be expected to negatively impact butter volumes and margin through the second half.\u201d",

However, the price of milk was still 13% down on a year earlier.</p> <p>Dairy farmers have endured three years of falling milk prices due to pressure from supermarkets to lower prices and falling overseas sales of British milk. </p> <p>The squeeze on the agricultural sector came to a head last summer when Aldi, Lidl, Asda and Morrisons were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/14/milk-row-aldi-morrisons-asda-raise-price\">targeted by protesters</a> who claimed they were paying less than the cost of production. Cows were paraded through the aisles of an Asda store in Stafford, in the West Midlands. The <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com/home/\">National Farmers Union</a> said dairy producers were facing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/10/farming-unions-call-for-seismic-change-in-way-food-is-sold-in-britain\">\u201cstate of emergency\u201d</a> after the price they were paid for milk fell by a quarter in a year.</p> <p>The slight uptick in prices in recent weeks has been driven by lower production levels from farms, with wet weather in June and hot weather in August playing a role, and an increase in demand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61204628e481886ae8825f76858849ce9a92092b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61204628e481886ae8825f76858849ce9a92092b/0_627_4421_2653/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmers protest over supermarket milk prices\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farmers protest over supermarket milk prices at the Morrisons depot in Bridgwater, Somerset, in August 2015.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dairy Crest has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/06/dairy-crest-milk-muller-british-farmers\">sold its milk business to M\u00fcller</a> but remains a key customer for farmers because it produces Cathedral City, Clover and other dairy products.</p> <p>Ruth Askew, the head of procurement at Dairy Crest, said: \u201cOur farmers have been facing difficult conditions on farm as the whole industry has dealt with unprecedented deflation over the past 18 months. </p> <p>\u201cDuring this time we have worked hard to support our farmers by paying a fair, stable and competitive milk price.\u201d</p> <p>Shares in Dairy Crest fell by 4% after a trading update revealed the increase in the price of milk.</p> <p>Mark Allen, Dairy Crest\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis sudden cost inflation is likely to have an impact on butter volumes and margins in the second half.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this, Allen said sales were rising for its key brands. Cathedral City has been relaunched this year with new branding and marketing.</p> <p>Darren Shirley, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cWhilst we fully expect Dairy Crest to be a beneficiary of inflation in UK and global dairy prices over the medium term, in the short term we keep a cautionary eye on the UK cream price, which has more than doubled since May 2016, and which could be expected to negatively impact butter volumes and margin through the second half.\u201d</p>",

However, the proposed overhaul of British water supply would only save households about \u00a38 a year on their water bill, the industry watchdog said. Under the existing system homeowners can only buy water from a handful of regional suppliers such as Yorkshire Water, Severn Trent or Thames Water. But a report by Ofwat suggests restructuring the industry to encourage new entrants to the market in an effort to improve services and bring down bills. The new regime would allow private companies to buy water in bulk from the existing major suppliers and sell it on to households. They could also offer packages including other services such as gas or electricity, Ofwat said. The plan echoes a similar overhaul of water supply to businesses, which will be able to switch their supplier from next April. Large industrial users of water can already switch suppliers. Ofwat said there would be significant costs in opening up the market which would \u201cultimately fall on companies and customers\u201d. \u201cIt is for the government to decide whether in principle it wants to introduce competition and, if so, how and when to do so,\u201d it said. Cathryn Ross, Ofwat\u2019s chief executive, said greater competition would benefit customers by encouraging firms to offer better services, such as allowing them to manage their bills with a mobile phone app. \u201cWe are living in an age of retail revolution, but water customers are being left behind,\u201d said Ross. \u201cThe service offers from water companies can feel behind the curve compared to the innovation customers benefit from when buying other goods. \u201cThe uncomfortable truth is that, when it comes to retail offers, water companies provide an analogue service in a digital age.\u201d Water UK, which represents the water companies, said: \u201cExtending retail competition to over 20m households could secure potential benefits for domestic customers, but would also be a major undertaking and so deserves to be given very careful consideration. \u201cWe look forward to a timely decision from government which helps sustain the stability the industry needs to continue successfully meeting the needs of its customers.\u201d The government has to approve any proposals before the market is opened up. Ofwat\u2019s intervention comes after it was criticised by MPs on the public accounts committee, who blamed the regulator for allowing bills to rise too much. The committee said Ofwat habitually overestimated water companies\u2019 costs, allowing them to inflate bills.",

The insurer, Britain\u2019s biggest mutual, said pre-tax profits to 30 June had fallen to \u00a31m, compared with \u00a349m a year earlier. Since the period covered by the results, interest rates have been cut as the Bank of England tries to stabilise the economy after the British vote to leave the European Union on 23 June. Richard Rowney, LV= chief executive, said: \u201cWe are operating in a prolonged low interest rate environment with significant volatility and this has created challenging market conditions.\u201d Profits for the company\u2019s general insurance business, which covers home and vehicle policies, fell from \u00a370m a year ago to \u00a322m. The insurer reported good growth in motor and commercial policy sales, but home insurance premiums were flat. In the first half of 2015 there had been several \u201cfavourable one-offs\u201d that had not been repeated this year, it said. Car insurance claims had been at the top end of expectations, LV= said, after increases in technology added to the cost of repairs. Low interest rates have also put pressure on the returns the insurer can get from the money it holds to cover payments.

Sales of fixed-term annuities, which offer retirees a guaranteed payout for a fixed period, were up by 42% year on year, while sales of its flexible guarantee products rose by 39%. \u201cWe continue to see a trend towards blended and hybrid products following the government\u2019s pension reforms, as people increasingly exercise their ability to choose how they fund their retirement,\u201d LV= said.

      "bodyText": "Passengers in a ThyssenKrupp elevator in the tallest building in the western hemisphere might have felt their ears pop on the way to the 63rd floor last Thursday. There, using Minority Report-style mixed-reality glasses, the German engineering behemoth had joined Microsoft to demonstrate the bleeding edge of elevator repair technology. At One World Trade Center in Manhattan, next to the 9/11 memorial, ThyssenKrupp Elevator Americas chief executive Rich Hussey said the company had been honing its ambitions after the recent Council on Tall Buildings, held this year in New York. In a Boston accent a little out of place from his German colleagues\u2019 marbled tones, Hussey said the company\u2019s contract for the gigantic skyscraper gave them a number of advantages, including bragging rights regarding a building so famous. \u201cIt\u2019s an engineering challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a chance to prove our technology.\u201d Some of that technology \u2013 though not the sideways elevators the company hopes to build \u2013 was on display: a virtual reality headset Microsoft calls the HoloLens, which enables a mechanic to poke around an elevator motor without climbing tens of floors or dangling in a precipitous shaft. As demonstrated to a few members of the press and engineering professionals, it was an appliance with obvious applications for video gamers. With ThyssenKrupp and other companies participating in a pilot program, however, Microsoft hopes to make a case for using the device professionally as well. The HoloLens looks like a heavy pair of ski goggles with a ratcheted knob to tighten its plastic straps against your scalp. Its lenses have a darkened square area, as if the inset on a pair of bifocals had been taken from a pair of sunglasses. When an elevator mechanic puts them on, the square area becomes a window in which he or she can see things that can be touched but not felt. Using hand-motions not too dissimilar from those Tom Cruise used in Minority Report, the influential 2002 Steven Spielberg sci-fi thriller, the wearer can then explode the engine and examine its individual parts, or make it gigantic and wander through it, until he or she find what needs replacing, re-ordering or tweaking, all without needing to know the dozen-syllable German words for the parts in question. Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing products store repositories of such parts and systems as used by the company. ThyssenKrupp, like Rolls Royce and other manufacturers of machines marketed on their down-to-the-micron engineering, has an advantage that lets it consider deploying expensive technology like the HoloLens all the way down to the level of the individual client: it employs all its technicians in the US, Hussey said. It is also expanding and will therefore need faster ways to improve and repair its products \u2013 an even more important part of its business than sales. Andreas Schierenbeck, chairman of the executive board at ThyssenKrupp, said such expansion was likely to be vertical. \u201cWe are here in one of the birthplaces of skyscrapers\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day we are adding floors the size of Manhattan.\u201d Schierenbeck told reporters that while \u201cthe one-mile tower is being planned\u201d, elevator repair lags far behind such advances. \u201cHalf of the elevators in the US are over 20 years old,\u201d he said.",

There, using Minority Report-style mixed-reality glasses, the German engineering behemoth had joined Microsoft to demonstrate the bleeding edge of elevator repair technology.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/24/minecraft-hololens-mixed-augmented-reality-microsoft\">Minecraft on Hololens: the future of gaming is right in front of your eyes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At One World Trade Center in Manhattan, next to the 9/11 memorial, ThyssenKrupp Elevator Americas chief executive Rich Hussey said the company had been honing its ambitions after the recent Council on Tall Buildings, held this year in New York. </p> <p>In a Boston accent a little out of place from his German colleagues\u2019 marbled tones, Hussey said the company\u2019s contract for the gigantic skyscraper gave them a number of advantages, including bragging rights regarding a building so famous. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an engineering challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a chance to prove our technology.\u201d</p> <p>Some of that technology \u2013 though not the sideways elevators the company hopes to build \u2013 was on display: a virtual reality headset Microsoft calls the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us\">HoloLens</a>, which enables a mechanic to poke around an elevator motor without climbing tens of floors or dangling in a precipitous shaft.</p> <p>As demonstrated to a few members of the press and engineering professionals, it was an appliance with obvious applications for video gamers. With ThyssenKrupp and other companies participating in a pilot program, however, Microsoft hopes to make a case for using the device professionally as well.</p> <p>The HoloLens looks like a heavy pair of ski goggles with a ratcheted knob to tighten its plastic straps against your scalp. Its lenses have a darkened square area, as if the inset on a pair of bifocals had been taken from a pair of sunglasses. </p> <p>When an elevator mechanic puts them on, the square area becomes a window in which he or she can see things that can be touched but not felt. Using hand-motions not too dissimilar from those Tom Cruise used in Minority Report, the <a href=\"https://www.fastcodesign.com/3046205/7-questions-for-the-guy-who-designed-minority-reports-futuristic-uis\">influential 2002 Steven Spielberg sci-fi thriller</a>, the wearer can then explode the engine and examine its individual parts, or make it gigantic and wander through it, until he or she find what needs replacing, re-ordering or tweaking, all without needing to know the dozen-syllable German words for the parts in question. </p> <p>Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing products store repositories of such parts and systems as used by the company.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OWhGiyR4Ns\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OWhGiyR4Ns?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>ThyssenKrupp demonstrates HoloLens\u2019 use for elevator repair.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>ThyssenKrupp, like Rolls Royce and other manufacturers of machines marketed on their down-to-the-micron engineering, has an advantage that lets it consider deploying expensive technology like the HoloLens all the way down to the level of the individual client: it employs all its technicians in the US, Hussey said. </p> <p>It is also expanding and will therefore need faster ways to improve and repair its products \u2013 an even more important part of its business than sales.</p> <p>Andreas Schierenbeck, chairman of the executive board at ThyssenKrupp, said such expansion was likely to be vertical. </p> <p>\u201cWe are here in one of the birthplaces of skyscrapers\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day we are adding floors the size of Manhattan.\u201d </p> <p>Schierenbeck told reporters that while \u201cthe one-mile tower is being planned\u201d, elevator repair lags far behind such advances.</p> <p>\u201cHalf of the elevators in the US are over 20 years old,\u201d he said. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Milk producers are lapping it up at the moment as prices soar, particularly for cream. Dairy Crest, the spreads company behind Clover, Country Life and Cathedral City, said it had recently had to raise the prices it paid to farmers by 12%. Chief executive Mark Allen said: Recently we have seen inflation across all dairy markets. To date we have announced increases amounting to 12% in the milk price we pay to farmers. Cream prices have been particularly affected, doubling over a very short period. This sudden cost inflation is likely to have an impact on butter volumes and margins in the second half. But as \u201ca strongly branded and added value business\u201d, he said Dairy Crest was well placed to deal with inflationary pressures and so its outlook for the full year remained unchanged. The comments came as Dairy Crest - now a pure food producer having sold its loss-making dairies division - said first half sales volumes of its four key brands would be ahead of last year. But pitching Cathedral City as a premium product and relaunching its branding and packaging , it discounted prices by less than competitors, leading to a small volume decline in the first half. However it said margins had improved and customers had responded positively to the new packaging and marketing campaign. On the price rises, Peel Hunt analyst Charles Hall said: Dairy prices are recovering sharply due to the improving global market, weaker sterling and lower UK milk production. This is resulting in a sharp price appreciation in raw milk and associated products. For instance spot milk has risen in recent weeks from 15p to 37p per litre with cream prices doubling from 80p to 160p. The industry is responding to this by increasing prices to farmers. For instance Dairy Crest increased its raw milk price by 1ppl to 22.7p in September and announced on Friday a further 1.5p increase spread over October and November. Other producers are seeing a similar trajectory, with some having to increase at a faster rate in order to hold onto their milk producers. We expect the price increases to be recovered in the market, with own label cheese suppliers, in particular, needing to recover higher prices in the short term. From Dairy Crest\u2019s point of view this should be helpful for margins given the timing of milk purchases and maturation period for cheese. In the spreads division, the main impact is on butter where Dairy Crest sells around 14,000t. Again the price increases will need to be passed on to customers by the industry, though Dairy Crest is relatively protected by its supply agreement. The company has highlighted that the price increases are likely to impact butter volumes and margins in the short term, which is not a surprise. This should be offset by higher cheese margins. Dairy Crest shares have dropped 2% to 654.5p following the news. Overall the market is moving higher as oil prices recover and investors await key interest rate meetings this week from both the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: After a torrid last week, investors will be pleased to see markets rebound this morning, with European equities on the rise ahead of the Bank of Japan and Federal Reserve decisions on Wednesday. With the expectation of no action in the US until at least December, the major market moving news is likely to be from Governor Haruhiko Kuroda - with investors hoping for significant intervention and forward guidance, including a further cut to rates. The dollar has weakened as investors bet the Fed will keep rates on hold, helping push commodity prices higher and lifting mining shares. Overall the FTSE 100 is 101.25 points better at 6811.53, with seven of the top ten risers being commodity companies. Anglo American is up 37.8p at 852.2p, Glencore has climbed 6.95p to 191.95p and Royal Dutch Shell A shares rising 45.5p to \u00a318.44. Satellite broadcaster Sky has climbed 21.5p to 861.5p as Morgan Stanley moved from overweight to equal weight but cut its target price from \u00a310.25 to \u00a310. The bank said the company\u2019s shares were oversold: Structural fears have driven Sky shares down 25% year to date so that it now trades at a around 9% 2018 estimated free cash flow yield and near its decade-low PE relative. Management\u2019s new targets and incentives though imply around 10% per annum earnings per share growth and 100p of earnings per share by 2021.

      "bodyText": "Shares of Mitie lost more than a quarter of their value after the outsourcing group published a profit warning triggered by the vote to leave the EU, government spending cuts and a slowing economy. Mitie, which employs 63,000 people across sectors including care for the elderly, office cleaning and immigration centres, said customers in the public and private sectors were delaying spending amid economic uncertainty following the EU vote and squeezed budgets. The company said customers put projects on hold in the run-up to 23 June and remained reluctant to order extra spending. As a result, Mitie, which also has cleaning contracts with the Ambassador Theatre Group and maintenance contracts with London and Quadrant housing trust, said annual profit would be much less than management had expected. Analysts predicted earnings before interest and tax would be about 15% lower than the \u00a3130m forecast before the update. Mitie shares plunged 28% to 192p \u2013 their lowest since early 2009 when Britain was in recession. More than half of Mitie\u2019s revenue comes from companies in the private sector. It said uncertainty created by the referendum result had prompted banks and other City firms to delay office maintenance they would normally commission on top of regular cleaning contracts. Local councils also have less money because of central government budget cuts and have reduced spending on maintaining social housing. Councils have also sought price cuts from Mitie\u2019s healthcare division, which provides home care for the elderly, making the business unviable in the current market. Ruby McGregor-Smith, Mitie\u2019s chief executive, said the trading environment was the most uncertain she had experienced in more than 20 years in the outsourcing business. The Conservative peer said cuts to local authority budgets had gone too far and called on the government to make more money available for essential services. She said: \u201cI think the budget pressures are incredibly significant. I think it should be reversed and it is too challenging.\u201d Mitie warned in May that local authority customers had less money to spend because of spending cuts and that the referendum had dented confidence. It brought forward Monday\u2019s trading statement from the end of the month after the effect on its business became clear. City analysts questioned McGregor-Smith for more than an hour about why trading had got so much worse. She said the trends had taken her team by surprise and the Brexit vote had exacerbated existing weakness. She told analysts: \u201cWe are seeing some pressures and some delays and, absolutely, we thought we would be in a better place than we are today. There is some high-margin work that has been delayed \u2026 We have been surprised by some of the delays we have seen in our business.\u201d McGregor-Smith, who has run Mitie for nine years, said she would review all options for the loss-making healthcare business but that Mitie had to be careful because vulnerable people and thousands of employees relied on its services. Courses of action include gradually ending contracts, selling the business and waiting until price pressure eases. She said: \u201cGoing back to 2010, I said we need to look at deficit reduction seriously but in some areas on the ground where we operate I see the impact of these cuts. I would say in some areas those cuts need to be changed, particularly when you are looking after the elderly and in social housing and education.\u201d McGregor-Smith said she supported the \u201cnational living wage\u201d but that the measure, along with extra pension contributions, meant customers have less money to spend on extra services. She said efficiency measures at Mitie, including cuts to its workforce, would cost about \u00a310m in the year to the end of March. She said Mitie was winning new contracts and she was confident about the company\u2019s future after short-term pressures ease. Mitie said job cuts would mainly be among senior managers as it combines administration functions.",

      "bodyText": "A year on from the \u201cDieselgate\u201d scandal that engulfed Volkswagen, damning new research reveals that all major diesel car brands, including Fiat, Vauxhall and Suzuki, are selling models that emit far higher levels of pollution than the shamed German carmaker. The car industry has faced fierce scrutiny since the US government ordered Volkswagen to recall almost 500,000 cars in 2015 after discovering it had installed illegal software on its diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests. But a new in-depth study by campaign group Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E) found not one brand complies with the latest \u201cEuro 6\u201d air pollution limits when driven on the road and that Volkswagen is far from being the worst offender. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this focus on Volkswagen as a \u2018dirty carmaker\u2019 but when you look at the emissions of other manufacturers you find there are no really clean carmakers,\u201d says Greg Archer, clean vehicles director at T&amp;E. \u201cVolkswagen is not the carmaker producing the diesel cars with highest nitrogen oxides emissions and the failure to investigate other companies brings disgrace on the European regulatory system.\u201d T&amp;E analysed emissions test data from around 230 diesel car models to rank the worst performing car brands based on their emissions in real-world driving conditions. Fiat and Suzuki (which use Fiat engines) top the list with their newest diesels, designed to meet Euro 6 requirements, spewing out 15 times the NOx limit; while Renault-Nissan vehicle emissions were judged to be more than 14 times higher. General Motors\u2019 brands Opel-Vauxhall also fared badly with emissions found to be 10 times higher than permitted levels. The new models are not breaking the law and the manufacturers say they comply with all current regulations. But cars are are able to be on the road because of the difference between emissions produced in lab tests and real on-road driving situations. Since September 2015 new diesel cars have had to comply with a new European exhaust emissions standard called Euro 6 which set a limit of 0.08g per km. The new rules heralded a significant reduction from the previous \u201cEuro 5\u201d standard which allowed 0.18g per km. NOx pollution is considered to be a serious public health risk, causing the early deaths of 23,500 people a year in the UK alone. The report \u2013 which also drew on data from investigations conducted by the British, French and German governments, as well as a large public database \u2013 surprisingly found Volkswagen to be selling among the cleanest diesel vehicles under the Euro 6 rules. Archer says this was not, however, evidence of the carmaker \u201clearning its lesson\u201d as these models were available before last year\u2019s scandal broke. The Dieselgate engines were mostly of the previous Euro 5 era which were sold between 2011 and 2015. T&amp;E estimates that there are 29m \u201cdirty\u201d diesel cars and vans on Europe\u2019s roads \u2013 a number that is still growing \u2013 with 4.3m of them being driven in the UK. The group classify a car as \u201cdirty\u201d if emissions are more than three times over the relevant NOx limit. Archer argues that a mass recall of dirty Euro 5 and 6 vehicles is required given the average lifetime of a car is 17 years. \u201cSoftware upgrades could easily be implemented to ensure the exhaust systems operate in normal driving conditions as the law clearly states,\u201d he argues. For Euro 5 vehicles, the five worst performing companies were, in order of the highest emissions: Renault (including Dacia), Land Rover, Hyundai, Opel/Vauxhall (including Chevrolet) and Nissan. For current Euro 6 cars a different pattern emerges. The worst performers are: Fiat (including Alfa Romeo) and Suzuki (to whom Fiat supply engines), Renault (including Nissan, Dacia and Infiniti), Opel/Vauxhall, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz. Last month French investigators said they had found that a large number of diesel cars emitted much higher levels of pollution than their European manufacturers claim. According to the independent committee\u2019s report, around a third of the 86 diesel vehicles tested produced levels of NOx well above European limits. The results echo similar findings in tests by the UK\u2019s Department for Transport. In a statement Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said an internal review had confirmed that its diesel engine applications complied with emissions regulation. It added: \u201cThe EU is working towards the adoption of a new testing procedure to bring it closer to what one would expect under real driving conditions. FCA supports these efforts and welcomes the introduction of new regulations which should provide clarity for customers and the industry.\u201d Mike Hawes, chief executive of the UK trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the tests conducted by various governments had consistently shown the tested vehicles to be legal. \u201cThe differences between official laboratory tests and those performed in the \u2018real world\u2019 are well known, and industry acknowledges the need for fundamental reform,\u201d he added. A spokesperson for Hyndai said the company meets all current regulatory standards: \u201cNew Euro 6 cars are built using the best available technology to comply with these regulations and they produce less NOx emissions than their predecessors. Hyundai Motor takes environmental compliance extremely seriously and is committed to meeting forthcoming new targets and to significantly improving the environmental performance of its vehicles.\u201d Renault, Opel/Vauxhall, Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover and Nissan did not respond to requests for comment on the report. The EU has tightened emissions regulations and from September 2017 diesels that emit more than double the lab limit for NOx on the road will be banned from sale. Hawes added that next year\u2019s introduction of an on-road Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test, as well as tougher lab tests, would help to provide consumers with the \u201creassurance that manufacturers are delivering on air quality\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A $175m offer from Gina Rinehart to build a high-end cancer hospital in Darwin is not entirely off the cards, despite the former chief minister Adam Giles claiming it was only going to go ahead if he won. The deal, first reported in 2014, is believed to have included a state-of-the art facility providing world-leading care for international clients as well as Australians, in return for the Northern Territory government providing waterfront land. On Saturday Giles told the NT News the deal was off the table because he was no longer chief minister. \u201cShe was doing it because of me. I would say 99.99% it\u2019s dead,\u201d Giles said. However, on Sunday, Rinehart\u2019s media adviser, the former Liberal MP Sophie Mirabella, refuted the claim. A statement from Rinehart\u2019s office said while Rinehart had \u201cboth trust and confidence\u201d in the former chief minister regarding the project, she hadn\u2019t heard from the new Labor government yet. The offer remains, providing the new government can meet the same conditions. \u201cThe donation was always on the basis of a peppercorn rental for suitable coastal land to be made available, which the hospital and donors would not own, and with all required approvals for building the hospital,\u201d it said. The deal was first reported in 2014 and confirmed by Rinehart the following year, after she visted Darwin and toured potential sites with Giles. According to government sources, Giles called a meeting in late 2014 after Rinehart personally made a \u201cdiscreet offer\u201d. Giles immediately directed his then health minister, Robyn Lambley, the head of the health department, Len Notaras, and a senior bureaucrat, Anne Tan, to visit a particular facility in Turkey and determine how it could be replicated in Darwin. The Istanbul site was a nondescript shopfront disguising world-leading medical equipment, services and specialists. The short trip, which also took in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, was shrouded in secrecy, with the group not knowing the location of the Istanbul facility until they arrived and called around external sources. The facility, which Lambley said catered to high-end and VIP clients, including royalty, was understood to have impressed the group but Lambley told Guardian Australia she didn\u2019t think it was viable and the chief minister was informed as much on their return. \u201cThe medical tourism industry is extremely competitive throughout the world,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were told people would only go to a facility if the medical specialists were first class internationally and people would only pay to go to a particular destination that had the appeal of not just medical services but other appeals as well.\u201d Lambley said one Australian specialist at the hospital said in his opinion the only place such a facility would be successful in Australia was at the Gold Coast. \u201cIn hindsight it was a complete waste of time and money in my opinion,\u201d Lambley said. \u201cWithin weeks of coming back Giles reshuffled the whole of cabinet.\u201d She said the competitive market and the need to attract the best specialists, coupled with Darwin\u2019s low global recognition and the high cost of labour for a facility that catered \u201caround the clock\u201d to its high-end patients, made it an unrealistic venture. Few details of the Rinehart deal were made available to the delegates and there remains confusion about exactly what it entailed, including whether the \u201cfor-profit charity\u201d would cater to local Northern Territory patients without private insurance, Guardian Australia was told. In February 2015 Rinehart first indicated the project was already funded. Accepting an award in Kuala Lumpur last year, Rinehart said her company had paid back loans for three mining operations and \u201cwere able to fund our commitment for the largest charitable donation in Australian history \u2013 to build a private specialised cancer and keyhole hospital for primarily the people of Northern Australia\u201d. She said the hope was it would be based on the Darwin coastline \u201cso that patients, and medical staff, can also enjoy water views, while recuperating and working\u201d. \u201cIt was very vague \u2013 I never saw anything in writing,\u201d Lambley told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere was no agreement between Gina Rinehart and the government that was in writing. My understanding was it was a discussion between Mrs Rinehart and the chief minister and we were dispatched to go on this reconnaissance mission to collect information based on that conversation \u2026 There was no documentation, there was no plan.\u201d The new Northern Territory government has been contacted for comment but the chief minister, Michael Gunner, on Sunday said he would look at the project to see if it suited Territorians.",

Giles immediately directed his then health minister, Robyn Lambley, the head of the health department, Len Notaras, and a senior bureaucrat, Anne Tan, to visit a particular facility in Turkey and determine how it could be replicated in Darwin. The Istanbul site was a nondescript shopfront disguising world-leading medical equipment, services and specialists.</p> <p>The short trip, which also took in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, was shrouded in secrecy, with the group not knowing the location of the Istanbul facility until they arrived and called around external sources.</p> <p>The facility, which Lambley said catered to high-end and VIP clients, including royalty, was understood to have impressed the group but Lambley told Guardian Australia she didn\u2019t think it was viable and the chief minister was informed as much on their return.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/sophie-mirabella-appointed-to-senior-role-at-gina-rineharts-company\">Sophie Mirabella appointed to senior role at Gina Rinehart's company</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe medical tourism industry is extremely competitive throughout the world,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were told people would only go to a facility if the medical specialists were first class internationally and people would only pay to go to a particular destination that had the appeal of not just medical services but other appeals as well.\u201d</p> <p>Lambley said one Australian specialist at the hospital said in his opinion the only place such a facility would be successful in Australia was at the Gold Coast.</p> <p>\u201cIn hindsight it was a complete waste of time and money in my opinion,\u201d Lambley said. \u201cWithin weeks of coming back Giles reshuffled the whole of cabinet.\u201d</p> <p>She said the competitive market and the need to attract the best specialists, coupled with Darwin\u2019s low global recognition and the high cost of labour for a facility that catered \u201caround the clock\u201d to its high-end patients, made it an unrealistic venture.</p> <p>Few details of the Rinehart deal were made available to the delegates and there remains confusion about exactly what it entailed, including whether the \u201cfor-profit charity\u201d would cater to local Northern Territory patients without private insurance, Guardian Australia was told.</p> <p>In February 2015 Rinehart first indicated the project was already funded.</p> <p>Accepting an award in Kuala Lumpur last year, Rinehart said her company had paid back loans for three mining operations and \u201cwere able to fund our commitment for the largest charitable donation in Australian history \u2013 to build a private specialised cancer and keyhole hospital for primarily the people of Northern Australia\u201d.</p> <p>She said the hope was it would be based on the Darwin coastline \u201cso that patients, and medical staff, can also enjoy water views, while recuperating and working\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very vague \u2013 I never saw anything in writing,\u201d Lambley told Guardian Australia. </p> <p>\u201cThere was no agreement between Gina Rinehart and the government that was in writing. My understanding was it was a discussion between Mrs Rinehart and the chief minister and we were dispatched to go on this reconnaissance mission to collect information based on that conversation \u2026 There was no documentation, there was no plan.\u201d</p> <p>The new Northern Territory government has been contacted for comment but the chief minister, Michael Gunner, on Sunday said he would look at the project to see if it suited Territorians.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Conservation Foundation has renewed its legal challenge to Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine, appealing against a federal court ruling that endorsed its approval by the commonwealth. The ACF on Monday lodged an appeal against last month\u2019s decision, which found the then federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, was entitled to find the impact on global warming and the Great Barrier Reef from the Queensland mine\u2019s 4.6bn tonnes of carbon emissions \u201cspeculative\u201d. The president of the ACF, Geoff Cousins, said Australia\u2019s national environment protection laws were \u201cbroken\u201d if the minister could approve \u201ca mega-polluting coalmine \u2013 the biggest in Australia\u2019s history \u2013 and claim it will have no impact on the global warming and the reef\u201d. \u201cIf our environment laws are too weak to actually protect Australia\u2019s unique species and places, they effectively give companies like Adani a licence to kill,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cBe in no doubt, Adani\u2019s Carmichael proposal is massive and will lock in decades of damaging climate pollution if it goes ahead, further wrecking the reef. \u201cThe science is clear that we can have coal or the reef \u2013 but we can\u2019t have both.\u201d The Queensland Resources Council applauded the court\u2019s rejection of the original ACF challenge, saying it was a \u201cnonsense case\u201d akin to holding the Saudi Arabian government responsible for emissions from Australian cars running on their oil. The ACF argued Hunt had made an \u201cerror of law\u201d by not factoring in the impact of overseas \u201ccombustion\u201d of the coal over the 60-year life of the mine. Hunt had found it was \u201cnot possible to draw robust conclusions on the likely contribution of the project to a specific increase in global temperature\u201d. It was therefore \u201cdifficult to identify the necessary relationship between the taking of the action and any possible impacts on relevant matters of national environmental significance\u201d. Justice John Griffiths ruled it was \u201cplain that the minister did give consideration to greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion emissions and made an express finding that the proposed action would not have an unacceptable impact on the world heritage values of the reef\u201d. Cousins said Griffiths had acknowledged \u201cconsiderable public interest\u201d in the case and ACF was \u201cin no doubt that we represent the concerns of the majority of Australians\u201d. He referred to a ReachTel survey of 2,600 Australians around the same time as the federal court ruling showing 81% backed stronger national environment laws and 75% backed environment groups\u2019 right to bring legal challenges to mining projects. \u201cAnd 75% support environment groups\u2019 right to use legal avenues to uphold existing environmental laws. \u201cIt comes down to this. The planet-warming pollution from Adani\u2019s coalmine threatens the reef and all living things. The [ACF] does not accept this future \u2013 and we will take all reasonable steps we can to stop this mine.\u201d The ACF awaits a hearing date.",
