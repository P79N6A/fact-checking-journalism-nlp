      "bodyText": "Oil prices have slumped by 5% after the latest attempt by Saudi Arabia to kill off the threat from the US shale industry sent crude to its lowest level since the depths of the global recession almost seven years ago. Signs of disarray in the Opec oil cartel prompted fears of a global glut of oil, wiping $2 off the price of a barrel of crude on Monday and leading to speculation that energy costs could continue tumbling over the coming weeks. Shares in energy companies lost ground as the impact of the drop in oil prices rippled through European stock markets. Prices of other commodities also weakened following disappointment among traders that Opec had decided late last week to keep flooding the global market with cheap oil. Iron ore continued its steady fall and finished the latest session at $38.90 per tonne, squeezing profit margins to the bone at even large producers such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, whose shares fell sharply on the Australian stock market on Tuesday. The consultancy Capital Economics tweeted: \u201c#Oil sell-off after #OPEC makes even ECB look good. Better to have announced something, even if less than hoped for, than nothing at all...\u201d A barrel of benchmark Brent crude was changing hands for less than $41 a barrel in New York on Monday night after Opec \u2013 heavily influenced by Saudi Arabia \u2013 did nothing about a market already seen as saturated. US light crude, which tends to trade at slightly lower levels than Brent, recorded similar falls, dropping from just over $40 a barrel to less than $38 a barrel. Both Brent and US light crude were at levels not seen since early 2009, when the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers triggered the most severe recession since the 1930s. As recently as August 2014, Brent stood at $115 a barrel, but in 16 months its price has been more than halved in response to a slowdown in China and other emerging market economies, and the end of oil sanctions against Iran. Global supply of oil is currently thought to be up to 2m barrels per day higher than demand, with traders fearing that Opec\u2019s refusal to cut production despite the financial pain it is causing its members\u2019 economies will lead to a still greater glut of crude. Venezuela, in particular, is thought to be suffering badly as a result of the drop in oil prices. The fall, if sustained, will lead to lower inflation in oil-consuming nations through the knock-on effects on petrol, diesel, domestic energy prices and the cost of running businesses. Lower crude prices may also delay or limit increases in interest rates. The Bank of England has already accepted that inflation \u2013 which stands at -0.1% \u2013 has stayed lower for longer this year than it anticipated. Analysts believe the slide in oil prices has come too late to persuade the US Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, to delay an increase in the cost of borrowing later this month, adding that the prospect of the first tightening of policy from the Fed since 2006 was an added factor in crude\u2019s decline. The prospect of higher US interest rates has led to the value of the US dollar rising on foreign exchanges; since oil is priced in dollars that has led to a fall in the cost of crude. Markets had been expecting Opec to announce a new ceiling on production after last Friday\u2019s meeting, but analysts at Barclays said the lack of any curbs in its announcement was a sign of discord. \u201cPast communiques have at least included statements to adhere, strictly adhere, or maintain output in line with the production target. This one glaringly did not,\u201d they said. Saudi Arabia needs oil prices of $100 a barrel to balance its budget, but as the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude it is gambling that the low price will knock out the threat posed by so-called unconventional supplies, such as shale. The chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, said at a conference in Doha on Monday that he hoped to see oil prices adjust at the beginning of next year as unconventional oil supplies start to decline. In a sign that US production could dip, Baker Hughes\u2019 November data showed US rig count numbers down month-by-month by 31 to 760 rigs. The fall in oil prices helped wipe almost 1% off share prices in New York. Wall Street\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 160 points in early trading, with Chevron and Exxon both losing around 3% of their value. In London, Shell\u2019s share price was down 4.5% while BP lost 3.4% of its value as early gains in the FTSE 100 were wiped out. The Index closed 15 points lower at 6223.",

      "bodyText": "So much for the idea that the US shale industry would be killed by Saudi Arabia\u2019s high-risk strategy, adopted a year ago, of keeping Opec\u2019s taps open and flooding the market with supplies. After 12 months of this experiment, it is Opec that is in chaos. Meanwhile, US oil production has barely been dented. Volumes have fallen 5% in the past six months, but the backdrop was a shale-driven 50% increase in production between mid-2012 and mid-2015, according to US government data. In short, the Saudis have gained next to nothing. No wonder the price of Brent crude now stands at a near seven-year low of $41 a barrel. And no wonder last week\u2019s meeting of the Opec cartel ended in chaos. The members were expected to agree only small production cuts but, in the event, they couldn\u2019t even manage a token gesture. The Saudis don\u2019t trust the Iranians to cut production, and thus the outcome was stalemate, accompanied by screams of anguish from the likes of Venezuela. Opec will continue its strategy of attrition, not because its members are enthusiastic, but because they can\u2019t agree to change course. The Saudis seem to have made the oldest mistake in the book. The theory that an intense period of low oil prices, say $50, would drive US shale and some conventional oil producers out of business was plausible on paper. But it overlooked the practical evidence of many decades that, in oversupplied commodity markets, producers try to stay in business to the bitter end. Investment in shale and conventional oil has plunged, it is true \u2013 the evidence is the slump in the number of rigs operating in the US. But investment and production are different things. Producers adapt. They squeeze their suppliers, they drill only their best prospects, and they cut costs. BHP Billiton, for example, has slashed spending on its US shale fields, but last month predicted that \u201cimproved recoveries and lower drilling costs will deliver stable production\u201d this year at its Black Hawk and Permian onshore oilfields in Texas. BHP is a big, diversified miner. But even lower down the food chain, the US system encourages survival. Half the US coal industry, under even more intense pricing pressures, seems to have passed in and out of chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in recent years, but it is still there. Small US shale independents, despite the distressed prices at which their debt trades, could yet perform the same trick. In the end, of course, low oil prices will probably deliver production cuts, as the Saudis intended; it\u2019s just that the timescale is constantly being extended as oil inventories soar. Having persuaded its Opec co-travellers to sign up for a short campaign, the Saudis risk being dragged into a long battle by default. The low oil price is great news (at least for the time being) for oil-consuming countries. But when, like the Saudis, you require $100-a-barrel oil to balance your budget, you have a serious problem. Even foreign-exchange reserves of $640bn don\u2019t last for ever. Bonfire of the dividends In an average year, you might expect only two, three, maybe four FTSE 100 companies to cut their dividends. There is always a crisis somewhere, but dividends, according to traditional boardroom thinking, are sacrosanct until the management has exhausted all other options to save cash or restore earnings. By that yardstick, 2015 is turning out to be the year of the bonfire of the dividends. Barring a miracle, Anglo American will today become the eighth FTSE 100 company to announce a cut, following Antofagasta, Centrica, Glencore, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Standard Chartered and Tesco. That\u2019s a long list. Of course, there are counterbalancing tales. Some of the other 92, such as Next and ITV, continue to spit out special dividends, and the FTSE 100\u2019s crew of housebuilders \u2013 Berkeley, Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey \u2013 are in a race to see how much capital they can return, and how quickly. But eight divi-cutters in a year feels like a turning point of some sort for a six-year-old bull market. As for next year, current high yields suggest the market also questions the medium-term sustainability of dividends at a further seven companies, some of them biggies: Aberdeen Asset Management, BHP Billiton, BP, GlaxoSmithKline, Pearson, Rolls-Royce and Shell. Worrying. Where\u2019s the Gherkin? \u2026 Just what the City doesn\u2019t need: yet another skyscraper. At least the giant 1 Undershaft will be squashed against the Gherkin and the Cheesegrater, and thus won\u2019t ruin views from the river of Tower Bridge, as the hideous Walkie-Talkie does. All the same, the Gherkin is the only new tall building in the City that has generated any affection among Londoners; now we\u2019ll barely be able to see it.",

The members were expected to agree only small production cuts but, in the event, they couldn\u2019t even manage a token gesture. The Saudis don\u2019t trust the Iranians to cut production, and thus the outcome was stalemate, accompanied by screams of anguish from the likes of Venezuela. Opec will continue its strategy of attrition, not because its members are enthusiastic, but because they can\u2019t agree to change course.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/07/opec-plan-kill-us-shale-oil-price-down-seven-year-low\">Opec bid to kill off US shale sends oil price down to near seven-year low</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Saudis seem to have made the oldest mistake in the book. The theory that an intense period of low oil prices, say $50, would drive US shale and some conventional oil producers out of business was plausible on paper. But it overlooked the practical evidence of many decades that, in oversupplied commodity markets, producers try to stay in business to the bitter end.</p> <p>Investment in shale and conventional oil has plunged, it is true \u2013 the evidence is the slump in the number of rigs operating in the US. But investment and production are different things. Producers adapt. They squeeze their suppliers, they drill only their best prospects, and they cut costs. BHP Billiton, for example, has slashed spending on its US shale fields, but last month predicted that \u201cimproved recoveries and lower drilling costs will deliver stable production\u201d this year at its Black Hawk and Permian onshore oilfields in Texas.<br></p> <p>BHP is a big, diversified miner. But even lower down the food chain, the US system encourages survival. Half the US coal industry, under even more intense pricing pressures, seems to have passed in and out of chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in recent years, but it is still there. Small US shale independents, despite the distressed prices at which their debt trades, could yet perform the same trick.</p> <p>In the end, of course, low oil prices will probably deliver production cuts, as the Saudis intended; it\u2019s just that the timescale is constantly being extended as oil inventories soar. Having persuaded its Opec co-travellers to sign up for a short campaign, the Saudis risk being dragged into a long battle by default. The low oil price is great news (at least for the time being) for oil-consuming countries. But when, like the Saudis, you require $100-a-barrel oil to balance your budget, you have a serious problem. Even foreign-exchange reserves of $640bn don\u2019t last for ever.</p> <h2>Bonfire of the dividends</h2> <p>In an average year, you might expect only two, three, maybe four FTSE 100 companies to cut their dividends. There is always a crisis somewhere, but dividends, according to traditional boardroom thinking, are sacrosanct until the management has exhausted all other options to save cash or restore earnings.<br></p> <p>By that yardstick, 2015 is turning out to be the year of the bonfire of the dividends. Barring a miracle, Anglo American will today become the eighth FTSE 100 company to announce a cut, following Antofagasta, Centrica, Glencore, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Standard Chartered and Tesco. That\u2019s a long list.</p> <p>Of course, there are counterbalancing tales. Some of the other 92, such as Next and ITV, continue to spit out special dividends, and the FTSE 100\u2019s crew of housebuilders \u2013 Berkeley, Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey \u2013 are in a race to see how much capital they can return, and how quickly.</p> <p>But eight divi-cutters in a year feels like a turning point of some sort for a six-year-old bull market. As for next year, current high yields suggest the market also questions the medium-term sustainability of dividends at a further seven companies, some of them biggies: Aberdeen Asset Management, BHP Billiton, BP, GlaxoSmithKline, Pearson, Rolls-Royce and Shell. Worrying.</p> <h2>Where\u2019s the Gherkin? \u2026</h2> <p>Just what the City doesn\u2019t need: yet another skyscraper. At least <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/dec/07/1-undershaft-tallest-skyscraper-city-of-london-eric-parry\">the giant 1 Undershaft</a> will be squashed against the Gherkin and the Cheesegrater, and thus won\u2019t ruin views from the river of Tower Bridge, as the hideous Walkie-Talkie does. All the same, the Gherkin is the only new tall building in the City that has generated any affection among Londoners; now we\u2019ll barely be able to see it.<br></p>",

Aldi said its exclusive Veuve Monsigny champagne, made by the renowned French producer Philizot &amp; Fils and priced at \u00a310.99, had become a firm favourite of shoppers across the country after winning a reputation for top quality at an affordable price.

Aldi said Veuve Monsigny had won plaudits for its \u201caromas of baked apple, brioche and stone fruits, with gorgeous flavours of red fruit, ending in a long, extremely delicious finish\u201d. Among the accolades it has won are a Decanter silver, an IWSC bronze, and a Quality Drink award. It was also recommended by Good Housekeeping in its most recent Christmas taste test. However, it did not feature in the top 10 champagnes in a recent Which? taste test, in which the Co-operative\u2019s Les Pionniers NV was voted the best Christmas bubbly. Philizot &amp; Fils is the only champagne producer that Aldi works with and its current owners are the fourth generation to run the business, based in the Marne valley in the heart of the Champagne region. One in every 13 bottles of all wine sold in UK shops during 2015 was from Aldi, the retailer claimed. It has also stocked up with premium wines and spirits for the festive season. These include the Imperial Collection Gold Vodka, purified using gold thread and sold in a bottle decorated with 24-carat gold. It costs \u00a319.99, but Aldi claims the same product is available on Amazon for \u00a335. Aldi\u2019s director of wine buying, Mike James, who plans the retailer\u2019s Christmas drinks range as early as January, said: \u201cWe\u2019re expecting our champagne range to be particularly popular over the coming months.

      "bodyText": "It was a mixed day in the end for European shares. Comments from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi that the bank would do whatever was necessary to support the eurozone economy provided strong support at the outset. But the slump in crude oil prices to a near seven year low following Friday\u2019s inconclusive Opec meeting pushed shares off their best levels, with Wall Street opening sharply lower as energy companies dropped back. In the UK Royal Dutch Shell and BG fell 4% while BP was down 3%. In the US Chevron and Exxon are currently down around 4%, while France\u2019s Total is nearly 1.5% lower. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 14.77 points or 0.24% to 6223.52 after earlier rising to 6287 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.25% to 10,886.09, down from its peak of 10.992 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.88% at 4756.41 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.07% to 22,037.17 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.36% at 10,042.4 In Greece, the Athens market rose 0.21% to 608.85 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 129 points or 0.73%. As for oil, Brent crude is 4.2% or $1.87 lower at $41.13, its worst level since February 2009. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Oil prices could fall still further, reckons Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG: The ability of the FTSE 100 to perform is clearly being hindered by tumbling oil prices, and with Brent hitting a new six-year low, the [likelihood] is that this will hold back this market for some time yet. As Shell, BG and BP lead the FTSE losers, the fate of the FTSE is in the hands of the dollar as another Fed fuelled dollar rally could send crude tumbling once more. With OPEC seeming less and less like a cartel and more like an audience with the Saudis, it is likely crude prices could fall further yet. Meanwhile Opec is getting the blame from Capital Economics: Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: It is hard to tell what is having a bigger impact on the Dow Jones, the chunky losses for Chevron and ExxonMobil or lingering resentment towards the now almost certain December rate-hike set to appear next week. Given the sharp rise that greeted the (ostensibly) lift-off securing non-farm jobs report last Friday, it is likely that the plunging oil price has created the bigger pressure, even if a bit of dovish drag can\u2019t be completely discounted. Either way the Dow started the day down by around 100 points, in the process loping some of the more extravagant highs off the European indices. With the Dow now down 114 points, here are the companies leading the fallers (notably Chevron and Exxon Mobil): Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s take on the falling oil price. Our economics editor writes: The latest attempt by Saudi Arabia to kill off the threat from US shale oil has sent oil prices slumping to their lowest level since the depths of the global recession almost seven years ago. A barrel of benchmark Brent crude was changing hands at below $42 a barrel after the oil cartel Opec - heavily influenced by Saudi Arabia \u2013 decided late last week to continue flooding the global market with cheap oil. With global demand weak, traders fear that Opec\u2019s refusal to cut production despite the financial pain it is causing its members\u2019 economies will lead to an ever-deeper world glut of crude. Brent stood at $43 a barrel when business began in the City on Monday and fell steadily before receiving a fresh downward push when trading opened in New York. The price fall, if sustained, will lead to lower inflation in oil-consuming nations through the knock-on effects on petrol, diesel, domestic energy prices and the cost of running businesses. Lower crude prices may also delay or limit increases in interest rates. The Bank of England has already accepted that inflation \u2013 which currently stands at -0.1% \u2013 has stayed lower for longer this year than it anticipated. Analysts believe the current slide in oil prices has come too late to persuade the US Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, to delay an increase in the cost of borrowing later this month, adding that the prospect of the first tightening of policy from the Fed since 2006 was an added factor in crude\u2019s decline. Larry\u2019s full report is here: The falling oil price has helped push US shares lower in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently down 90 points or 0.5%. Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the leading fallers, unsurprisingly with Brent crude sliding below $42 a barrel at one point and US crude 3% lower at $38.7. The decline in the US market has taken some of the shine off European shares, with the FTSE 100 now up just 3 points. Reuters has a good take on the situation: Oil prices fell to their lowest in nearly seven years on Monday after OPEC\u2019s meeting ended in disagreement over production cuts and without a reference to its output ceiling, while a stronger dollar made it more expensive to hold crude positions. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ended its policy meeting on Friday without agreeing to lower production. For the first time in decades, oil ministers dropped any reference to the group\u2019s output ceiling, highlighting disagreement among members about how to accommodate Iranian barrels once Western sanctions are lifted.... More here: Oil at lowest in almost seven years on OPEC inaction, strong dollar Oil is also suffering from the prospect of a historic US interest rate rise next week. That is pushing up the US dollar (and thus pushing down the price of commodities priced in dollars). That is compounding the surprise after Opec didn\u2019t manage to agree a production cut at last week\u2019s meeting. Tamas Varga, oil analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates in London, explains: \u201cA stronger dollar and the aftershock of Friday\u2019s OPEC meeting are weighing on the oil market.\u201d Hold onto your hats, folks. Brent crude, which is oil sourced from the North Sea, has just hit its lowest level since March 2009 as the oil rout escalates. A barrel of Brent Crude is now changing hands at below $42 per barrel. That\u2019s a drop of over 2.5%, or more than $1 per barrel. That takes Brent down to levels not seen since March 2009, when the world economy entered recession following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Traders are citing the prospect of fresh oil gluts next year, as Opec members continue to pump crude into the market. US crude is now almost within a dollar of its 2015 low - the $37.75 per barrel hit in August. That was the lowest since December 2008. The US oil price has just fallen through $39 per barrel to hit $38.97, a new three-month low. Crude prices are coming under new pressure as US traders arrive at their desks. They\u2019ve had a weekend to digest Opec\u2019s confusing meeting on Friday, where the cartel was unable to agree new production levels (see earlier post for the backstory) European stock markets are driving higher, as the delayed \u201cSanta Rally\u201d get underway. The fall in the euro today has helped push Germany\u2019s DAX up by 2%, recovering a decent chunk of last week\u2019s losses. Investors are taking heart from Mario Draghi\u2019s Friday night speech, when he said there were \u201cno limits\u201d to the actions the ECB could take. Conner Campbell of Spreadex explains: Today\u2019s trading is in sharp contrast to the post-Draghi plunge of last Thursday, and only so much can be attributed to an improved, but still lower than expected, region-wide Sentix investor confidence figure. No, instead it appears that the ECB president managed to reassure investors at the weekend when he trotted out a fresh riff on his usual \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 spiel, stating that \u2018there cannot be any limit to how far we are willing to deploy our instruments\u2026to achieve [the central bank\u2019s] mandate\u2019. Over in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are gathering for a regular Eurogroup meeting. There\u2019s nothing too dramatic on the agenda - ministers are due to discuss banking supervision, the state of Greece\u2019s bailout, and the general issue of pension reforms. It\u2019s the first eurogroup since Portugal\u2019s new left-wing government took power, on a pledge to reverse austerity and deliver more growth. The EC is anxious, though, as Lisbon has not yet submitted a 2016 budget for inspection. Pierre Moscovici, European commissioner, is urging them to hurry up.... There\u2019s a smell of burning rubber, and burnt fingers, from Goldman Sachs today. Goldman has abandoned its prediction that the euro would fall below parity with the US dollar next year, following the ECB\u2019s underwhelming new stimulus package announced on Thusday. It now thinks the euro will be trading around $1 in a year\u2019s time, not smashing through that point to $0.95, as it previously expected. Anyone who took Goldman\u2019s advice last week is sitting on a loss. The euro jumped from $1.053 to $1.098, after the ECB dashed expectations that it would boost its QE programme above the current level of \u20ac60bn/month. The euro has dipped this morning, after Mario Draghi reiterated on Friday night that the ECB would take more action if needed. It\u2019s currently trading around $1.08, down from $1.089 at the open. No prizes for spotting the correlation here: The Russian rouble is falling in parallel with the oil price. Russia\u2019s currency has hit its lowest level since August today, down 1% at 68.79 roubles to the US dollar. Russia\u2019s break-even price for oil production is around $100 per barrel, so the current situation is a headache for president Putin. Moscow has already been forced to rewrite its 2016 budget this summer, following the slump in crude prices. There\u2019s no guarantee that America\u2019s shale oil industry will throw in the towel, even if prices keep falling. Analysts had expected more shale producers to collapse during 2015, in the face of Opec\u2019s refusal to cut production. However, the sector has proved more resilient than expected - partly because firms have decided to press on, having invested money in building infrastructure when prices were much higher. The Wall Street Journal flags up that US oil production could actually increase in 2016. Here\u2019s a flavour: The situation has surprised even seasoned oil traders. \u201cIt was anticipated that U.S. shale producers, the source of the explosive growth in supply in recent years, would be the first to fold,\u201d Andrew Hall, chief executive of the commodities hedge fund Astenbeck Capital Management LLC, wrote in a Dec. 1 letter to investors reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cBut this hasn\u2019t happened, at least not at the rate initially expected.\u201d He declined to comment further. Opec isn\u2019t the only group who suffers from low energy prices. Alternative suppliers, such as shale oil producers, are also in the firing line. If Opec sticks to its guns and keeps pumping oil, some rivals could be driven out of business. Around a third of companies who have defaulted on their loans this year operate in the energy sector. That\u2019s mainly because the oil price is below the break-even point for shale producers; this chart from the Financial Times shows the trend: Analyst at City firm Abshire Smith believes Opec has the shale industry in its firing line. OPEC output has outstripped it for 18 consecutive months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Now the organisation says it will keep pumping as much as it does now \u2013 about 31.5 million barrels a day \u2013 effectively endorsing limitless output. It seems the general consensus is that OPEC didn\u2019t decide anything on Friday and have opted for the already present Saudi Arabia-led policy of pump, pump, pump until external rivals such as Russian / US shale drillers are squeezed out of market share. And that means the oil sector will continue to be flooded with crude, pegging prices down. The oversupply is certainly looking likely to continue into the New Year. Iran, for so long limited under sanctions relating to their nuclear program have promised to increase its production levels to a s much as 4 million barrels a day by the end of 2016, they currently only produce 3.3 million barrels. More here: Is OPEC as we know it now dead? The oil price is continuing to fall, as Opec\u2019s failure to set new production targets last week continues to ripple through the markets. US crude has now shed 1%, to $39.43 per barrel. As this chart shows, many of Opec\u2019s members are vulnerable to a protracted period of low energy prices. (click here for a higher-resolution image) Optimism among eurozone analysts and investors has hit its highest level in four months. It\u2019s a result that may vindicate the European Central Bank\u2019s decision not to accelerate its bond-buying programme last week. Sentix, the research group, reports that its monthly economic sentiment index has jumped to 15.7 this month up from 15.1 in November. Optimism about future prospects rose significantly. That indicates Europe is outperforming the rest of the world, as it continues to recover from the debt crisis. Sentix says that other major world regions appear to be slowing, with Japan back in recession. And it gives the credit to the ECB\u2019s stimulus package, asking: What would the Eurozone economy be without the ECB and its president Mr Draghi? It\u2019s a bad morning for investors in outsourcing group Serco. Its shares tumbled by 12% at one stage, after it hit the City with a profit warning. Serco now expects to make a trading profit of just \u00a350m, compared with analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of \u00a369m. My colleague Sean Farrell explains what went wrong: Serco, which makes about a quarter of its money from the UK government, is struggling to recover from a series of problems with government contracts, including overcharging the UK for monitoring criminals and mismanaging an out of hours health centre in Cornwall. Recently it apologised for using a stretch limousine to transport some asylum seekers from London to Manchester. Rupert Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, took over running the company early last year. He repaired relations with the UK government, which had barred Serco and its rival G4S from new government outsourced work, and pledged to turn around operating performance by cutting costs and getting out of peripheral businesses.... More here: Today\u2019s fall in the oil price is bad for Opec\u2019s members, and other oil producers. But it\u2019s jolly good news for those who actually consume the stuff. Cheaper oil has effectively been a stimulus to Europe\u2019s economy, giving consumers more cash to spend (and giving central bankers an excuse to \u2018look through\u2019 the inflationary impact). H. Kumar, managing director of India\u2019s Mangalore Refinery &amp; Petrochemicals Ltd, told Bloomberg that: \u201cBig oil consumers will take a lot of succor and refiners will get good sleep.\u201d Those consumers include all the major industrialised nations (as well as Opec members who refine crude oil): Most shares are rising in London this morning, helping the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies recover from last week\u2019s selloff. BP and Royal Dutch Shell aren\u2019t enjoying today\u2019s stock market rally, though. Shares in both oil giants have fallen by around 1%, putting them on the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard: As predicted, European stock markets are rallying in early trading. Investors are putting the disappointment of last week\u2019s ECB Day behind then, pushing equities higher across Europe. Germany is leading the way, with the DAX up around 1%. Traders are taking solace from Mario Draghi\u2019s new pledge that there is \u201cno limit\u201d to what he\u2019ll do, if necessary (see opening post). Newsflash from Beijing: China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have fallen again. The People\u2019s Bank of China has reported that FX reserves dropped to $3.44 trillion by the end of November, down from $3.53 trillion a month before. It\u2019s a bigger fall than expected; analyst had pencilled in reserves around $3.49 trillion. Back in the summer of 2014, China\u2019s FX warchest totalled $4 trillion. It has been dipping into the reserves since to support the yuan. The turbulence in the energy sector has also hit Germany industrial heartland. New data shows that Germany industrial output rose by 0.2% in October, much weaker than the 0.7% rise expected by economists. That follows a 1.1% slide in September, when German firms were hit by falling demand from overseas. German energy producers reported that their production slumped by 5.9% in October. If you strip out energy, and construction, production was up by 0.7% (the red line in this chart) Any increase in output is welcome, but it\u2019s a little worrying that Germany didn\u2019t hit expectations. That\u2019s been something of a theme this autumn.... At around $40 per barrel, oil is well below the break-even point of Opec\u2019s members. That means they\u2019re still losing money on production, which could have a nasty knock-on impact on their budgets. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga warns that emerging market currencies could suffer: With concerns elevated around the aggressive oversupply in the markets, investor sentiment will remain haunted towards oil in the short-term and selling in the commodity will resume. This will consequently add pressures to those currencies that belong to economies which are reliant on oil exports. Today\u2019s selloff has pushed the oil price down to its lowest level since late August: OPEC\u2019s failure to set a production goal last week probably means oil prices will fall further, analysts say. One key factor is that the Iranian market is opening up, meaning more crude will flow into the markets. As ANZ bank puts it: \u201cThe effective removal of the OPEC quota leaves the market in a more vulnerable position. Prices are likely to weaken this week as the market turns its attention back on U.S. supply. With Iran exports likely to start increasing next year, this increases the likelihood of further weakness in crude oil markets.\u201d The oil price is coming under fresh pressure this morning, sending the cost of crude down to almost its lowest level this year. The cost of a barrel of US crude oil has fallen by almost 1% in early trading to $39.61, below the $40 barrel mark. Brent crude - sourced from the North Sea - has shed 0.6% to around $42.75/barrel. The selloff comes after Opec failed to agree new production quotas at its meeting last Friday. To the market\u2019s surprise, and alarm, the cartel did not agree a production ceiling. That means members will keep pumping oil at roughly current levels despite the glut that has driven prices down over the last year. Reuters explains why oil traders are reacting badly: A disagreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran meant that the group for the first time in decades didn\u2019t even mention an output quota, which previously stood at 30 million barrels per day (bpd). \u201cPast communiques have at least included statements to adhere ... or maintain output in line with the production target (of 30 million barrels per day). This one glaringly did not,\u201d Barclays bank said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like investors may get their Santa Rally after all. Shares are expected to rise in London and across Europe this morning, as traders recover their good spirits after last week\u2019s turbulence. As you may remember, shares plunged last Thursday after the European Central Bank disappointed the markets with its latest stimulus plan. Over the weekend, Mario Draghi reminded traders that the ECB\u2019s priority is to provide what the eurozone economy needs, not meet their expectations. But he also embraced the spirit of his 2012 \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d speech, declaring: \u201cThere cannot be any limit to how far we are willing to deploy our instruments, within our mandate, and to achieve our mandate.\u201d And talk of \u201cno limits\u201d will obviously please investors. Also coming up today.... There are two pieces of eurozone economic data to watch out for: The latest survey of German industrial production is being released now. At 9.30am we get the latest eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence report We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "The yellow flare from an RAF Tornado jet lit up Akrotiri base in Cyprus as it hurtled down the runway and roared into the night sky. It was one of four British jets that joined a mission to destroy an oilfield in eastern Syria just hours after MPs had voted in favour of Britain joining a 15-month bombing campaign last Wednesday night. When the stock market opened that Thursday morning, shares in British defence companies leapt. BAE Systems, the \u00a316bn company that is Europe\u2019s biggest weapons manufacturer, rose by four percentage points in early trading. The shares have risen by 13% since the Islamic State terror attacks in Paris on 13 November, which killed 130 people. The escalation of US-led military action in Syria, however controversial, will nevertheless be a shot in the arm for a defence industry that has been in survival mode since operations in Iraq and Afghanistan were wound down. Zafar Khan, defence analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, noted. \u201cWhat it does [the Paris attacks] is reassure people there is a need.\u201d \u201c[It brings] home the proximity of all the problems and so it was clear that Europe would not be cutting budgets any more.\u201d British companies such as BAE, Chemring and Cobham are viewed as likely to gain financially from a prolonged aerial campaign. BAE, which employs more than 88,000 people around the world, notched up profits of \u00a3508m in the first six months of this year. According to figures from ADS, the industry body, the defence sector employs 146,000 people in Britain and makes \u00a322bn in sales a year. It accounts for exports worth \u00a37.4bn each year, making Britain the world\u2019s second-biggest arms exporter after the US. Allied to this, the security industry \u2013 which covers everything from policing cyber-attacks to controlling large events such as the Olympics \u2013 employs a further 71,000 people, earns \u00a38.5bn in annual sales and exports \u00a32.4bn worth of goods and services. Even before the Paris attacks, analysts had begun upgrading defence stocks on signs that military spending was about to rise. This was particularly evident in the US, which is by far the biggest defence market and accounts for 40% of BAE\u2019s annual sales. A strengthening domestic economy and heightened tensions in the Middle East have shifted White House priorities. Khan said: \u201cEven before the Paris attacks there was a feeling that defence budgets had bottomed out.\u201d Next year will herald the first rise in US defence spending since 2010. The current two-year spending deal gave the Pentagon an additional $32bn (\u00a321bn) war fund for operations against Islamic State; the next deal, starting in 2016, will hand the US defence department around an extra $56bn over two years. Europe also looks likely to loosen its purse-strings following the atrocities in Paris. According to Nato figures, from 2009 to 2014 member countries excluding the US cut defence spending by $45bn, a 15% reduction over the five years. This downward trend is now expected to reverse. Analysts at IHS Jane\u2019s, the military sector specialist, reckon Europe\u2019s defence industry is set to reap a $50bn windfall as governments stock up on military hardware and tighten up security. Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivative strategy at BNP Paribas, said: \u201cIn the UK, the key company to invest in is BAE Systems. BAE is a huge defence supplier to the UK and US in particular, so it is well-placed to see a pick-up in orders and sales from this change in trend in Nato defence spending.\u201d The aerial campaign in Syria plays to BAE\u2019s strengths. The British company builds the RAF\u2019s Tornado and Eurofighter Typhoon jets, planes which cost around \u00a364m each. It is also a key industrial partner on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter built by the US firm Lockheed Martin. A less obvious, but hugely influential, contribution could come from its Brimstone missiles. A key plank of David Cameron\u2019s pitch to parliament ahead of last week\u2019s vote to back bombing targets in Syria was the Brimstone\u2019s capability for \u201csurgical strikes\u201d. The prime minister claimed the missile allowed opponents of Islamic State to \u201cstrike accurately with minimal collateral damage\u201d. Brimstone is British-designed and made by MBDA, a specialist missile manufacturer owned jointly by BAE, France-based Airbus Group and Finmeccanica of Italy. It uses a combined radar and laser guidance system to hit targets, including vehicles travelling at up to 70mph, while deploying a relatively small warhead to limit the blast zone. These 1.8m-long hi-tech missiles weigh just 49kg but cost \u00a3175,000 apiece. They can be fired from seven miles away and are able to switch direction to another target even after launch due to their electronic guidance system. Britain\u2019s Tornado jets can each carry 12 Brimstone missiles. Britain\u2019s latest five-year strategic defence and security review (SDSR), released last month, has also laid fertile ground for Britain\u2019s defence industry to thrive. In the review, David Cameron outlined plans to boost military spending by \u00a312bn. This huge injection of cash will triple the pace at which Britain buys F-35 jets from Lockheed Martin. It means the Royal Navy will have 24 of the jets to fly off its new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, instead of eight, when the first ship launches in 2020. Britain also plans to buy more US-built Reaper drones, nine submarine hunting aircraft from Boeing, and create two new 5,000-strong \u201cstrike brigades\u201d that will address threats around the world. The prime minister\u2019s trolley dash around the military bazaars of the west is in stark contrast to the penny-pinching that characterised the government\u2019s previous defence review in 2010. Back then, Britain was out of Iraq and operations in Afghanistan were winding down. The former coalition government responded by cutting aircraft, ships and personnel (around 17,000 uniformed personnel were given their marching orders). Post-Afghanistan, the increasingly meagre rations served up by lawmakers in Britain and America pummelled defence stocks. The rout led to failed merger talks in 2012 between BAE and Airbus Group, as Europe\u2019s two biggest aerospace and defence firms huddled together to ride out the storm. The future for Britain\u2019s biggest military manufacturer looks more rosy now. Chemring is another British arms manufacturer that views the hostilities as a potential opportunity. In its latest annual report, the producer of teargas grenades and guided missile decoys said: \u201cChemring is well-positioned to benefit from any sustained increase in demand as a result of the conflict in the Middle East.\u201d This article was amended on 8 December 2015 to clarify that the Brimstone missiles are able to switch direction to another target even after launch due to their electronic guidance system.",

BAE Systems, the \u00a316bn company that is Europe\u2019s biggest weapons manufacturer, rose by four percentage points in early trading. The shares have risen by 13% since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/27/paris-attacks-victims-families-attend-solemn-memorial-ceremony-two-weeks-on#block-56583b81e4b0dd35d29c32e3\">Islamic State terror attacks in Paris on 13 November, which killed 130 people</a>.</p> <p>The escalation of US-led military action in Syria, however controversial, will nevertheless be a shot in the arm for a defence industry that has been in survival mode since operations in Iraq and Afghanistan were wound down. </p> <p>Zafar Khan, defence analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, noted. \u201cWhat it does [the Paris attacks] is reassure people there is a need.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c[It brings] home the proximity of all the problems and so it was clear that Europe would not be cutting budgets any more.\u201d </p> <p>British companies such as BAE, Chemring and Cobham are viewed as likely to gain financially from a prolonged aerial campaign. BAE, which employs more than 88,000 people around the world, notched up profits of \u00a3508m in the first six months of this year.</p> <p>According to figures from ADS, the industry body, the defence sector employs 146,000 people in Britain and makes \u00a322bn in sales a year. It accounts for exports worth \u00a37.4bn each year, making Britain the world\u2019s second-biggest arms exporter after the US.</p> <p>Allied to this, the security industry \u2013 which covers everything from policing cyber-attacks to controlling large events such as the Olympics \u2013 employs a further 71,000 people, earns \u00a38.5bn in annual sales and exports \u00a32.4bn worth of goods and services.</p> <p>Even before the Paris attacks, analysts had begun upgrading defence stocks on signs that military spending was about to rise.</p> <p>This was particularly evident in the US, which is by far the biggest defence market and accounts for 40% of BAE\u2019s annual sales. A strengthening domestic economy and heightened tensions in the Middle East have shifted White House priorities.</p> <p>Khan said: \u201cEven before the Paris attacks there was a feeling that defence budgets had bottomed out.\u201d</p> <p>Next year will herald the first rise in US defence spending since 2010. The current two-year spending deal gave the Pentagon an additional $32bn (\u00a321bn) war fund for operations against Islamic State; the next deal, starting in 2016, will hand the US defence department around an extra $56bn over two years.</p> <p>Europe also looks likely to loosen its purse-strings following the atrocities in Paris.</p> <p>According to Nato figures, from 2009 to 2014 member countries excluding the US cut defence spending by $45bn, a 15% reduction over the five years.</p> <p>This downward trend is now expected to reverse. Analysts at IHS Jane\u2019s, the military sector specialist, reckon Europe\u2019s defence industry is set to reap a $50bn windfall as governments stock up on military hardware and tighten up security.</p> <p>Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivative strategy at BNP Paribas, said: \u201cIn the UK, the key company to invest in is BAE Systems. BAE is a huge defence supplier to the UK and US in particular, so it is well-placed to see a pick-up in orders and sales from this change in trend in Nato defence spending.\u201d</p> <p>The aerial campaign in Syria plays to BAE\u2019s strengths. The British company builds the RAF\u2019s Tornado and Eurofighter Typhoon jets, planes which cost around \u00a364m each. It is also a key industrial partner on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter built by the US firm Lockheed Martin.</p> <p>A less obvious, but hugely influential, contribution could come from its Brimstone missiles. A key plank of David Cameron\u2019s pitch to parliament ahead of last week\u2019s vote to back bombing targets in Syria was the Brimstone\u2019s capability for \u201csurgical strikes\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister claimed the missile allowed opponents of Islamic State to \u201cstrike accurately with minimal collateral damage\u201d. </p> <p>Brimstone is British-designed and made by MBDA, a specialist missile manufacturer owned jointly by BAE, France-based Airbus Group and Finmeccanica of Italy.</p> <p>It uses a combined radar and laser guidance system to hit targets, including vehicles travelling at up to 70mph, while deploying a relatively small warhead to limit the blast zone.</p> <p>These 1.8m-long hi-tech missiles weigh just 49kg but cost \u00a3175,000 apiece. They can be fired from seven miles away and are able to switch direction to another target even after launch due to their electronic guidance system. Britain\u2019s Tornado jets can each carry 12 Brimstone missiles.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s latest five-year strategic defence and security review (SDSR), released last month, has also laid fertile ground for Britain\u2019s defence industry to thrive.<br></p> <p>In the review, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/23/cameron-to-announce-new-strike-brigades-in-strategic-defence-review\">David Cameron outlined plans to boost military spending by \u00a312bn</a>. </p> <p>This huge injection of cash will triple the pace at which Britain buys F-35 jets from Lockheed Martin. It means the Royal Navy will have 24 of the jets to fly off its new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, instead of eight, when the first ship launches in 2020.</p> <p>Britain also plans to buy more US-built Reaper drones, nine submarine hunting aircraft from Boeing, and create two new 5,000-strong \u201cstrike brigades\u201d that will address threats around the world.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s trolley dash around the military bazaars of the west is in stark contrast to the penny-pinching that characterised the government\u2019s previous defence review in 2010. </p> <p>Back then, Britain was out of Iraq and operations in Afghanistan were winding down. The former coalition government responded by cutting aircraft, ships and personnel (around 17,000 uniformed personnel were given their marching orders). </p> <p>Post-Afghanistan, the increasingly meagre rations served up by lawmakers in Britain and America pummelled defence stocks. The rout led to failed merger talks in 2012 between BAE and Airbus Group, as Europe\u2019s two biggest aerospace and defence firms huddled together to ride out the storm.</p> <p>The future for Britain\u2019s biggest military manufacturer looks more rosy now.</p> <p>Chemring is another British arms manufacturer that views the hostilities as a potential opportunity. </p> <p>In its latest annual report, the producer of teargas grenades and guided missile decoys said: \u201cChemring is well-positioned to benefit from any sustained increase in demand as a result of the conflict in the Middle East.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 8 December 2015 to clarify that the Brimstone missiles are able to switch direction to another target even after launch due to their electronic guidance system.<br></li> </ul>",

Clarke\u2019s pay increased to \u00a33.97m mainly because of a long-term share bonus that paid him \u00a32.6m. His total pay included a \u00a3485,000 basic salary, \u00a314,000 in benefits such as a company car allowance and a \u00a3783,000 annual cash bonus. The bumper pay package is nearly double that of the boss of M&amp;S, Marc Bolland, who earned \u00a32.1m after securing his first bonus in two years, and is way ahead of Mike Coupe\u2019s at Sainsbury\u2019s, who received \u00a31.5m last year. Clarke received the maximum annual bonus, worth 160% of salary, after WHSmith\u2019s pretax profit hit \u00a3123m to beat a target of \u00a3119m. The retailer has benefited from the adult colouring book craze, the publication of Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James\u2019s new book Grey, and an uplift in air travel that has brought more customers through the doors of its airport outlets.

Around 100 of the job cuts are expected to be made in London, where the US bank has a base at Canary Wharf. Some of the job cuts have already been announced internally. The bank declined to comment on the restructuring programme. Morgan Stanley is cutting fixed-income staff, some of whom were hired relatively recently, after years of declining revenue and insufficient returns. Insiders say the rate of return on investment in fixed-income trading has dropped to as low as 5% after regulatory changes forced banks to hold more capital against trading activities. Global demand has also fallen dramatically in an era of stable and low interest rates. Bank sources said global fee income has fallen from around $160bn (\u00a3106bn) at the beginning of the millennium to $100bn immediately after the financial crash to even less than that now. Morgan Stanley reported a 42% plunge in profits in October, in what chief executive James Gorman called its worst quarter for fixed income, currencies and commodities since he took over in 2010. The bank is believed to have been put under pressure from investors to cut costs in response to falling revenues. Other parts of the bank\u2019s business are performing far better, with corporate deal-making enjoying a bumper year and equity-based transactions enjoying brisk business. Morgan Stanley is said to have decided to make substantial cuts now, while leaving the bulk of its fixed-income business in place for when trading recovers. Rival Goldman Sachs has suggested it will not make big job cuts in this area, presumably hoping to win market share from those banks, likely to include Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, who are retrenching.",

Comments from ECB president Mario Draghi over the weekend seem to have been taken more positively, as he reassured investors that the central bank would take whatever measures were necessary to support the eurozone economy. Meanwhile better than expected US jobs data on Friday, while reinforcing the view that the Federal Reserve will raise US rates this month, also provided some comfort about the state of the world\u2019s second largest economy. Insurers are among the gainers after the Bank of England gave the green light to 19 institutions on their internal models on solvency levels. Prudential has put on 24.5p to \u00a315.30 as it said it would be the first insurer to update on its capital position under new EU solvency rules. It plans an update on 19 January, while others will issue statements alongside annual results a month or so later. The optimism in the sector has lifted Legal &amp; General by 3p to 270.3p and Aviva 6p to 513.5p. Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said: At that stage, all focus is likely to be on the actual headroom, the coverage ratios and the expected implications, if any, on dividend policies. No doubt, we will have an increasing level of commentary on the companies as the respective announcement dates approach\u2026our view remains, that any dividend policies that have been elucidated to date, think Legal &amp; General, will remain intact (bearing in mind the various speeches made on the subject by the PRA in recent months). Elsewhere ITV has added 5.2p to 273.1p after the Guardian reported an expected bumper advertising spend for broadcasters over Christmas. In a buy note Ian Whittaker at Liberum said: ITV said it expected December ad spend to be up 4% at its interim management statement last month so - at least - they should meet that target and probably exceed it. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 45.59 points at 6283.88. But with Opec deciding not to cut oil production, crude is under pressure again, with Brent down 0.8% at $42.63 a barrel. So Royal Dutch Shell B shares are leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 28.5p at \u00a315.71 while BP is close behind, 6.05p lower at 353.65. BG, which Shell is in the throes of buying, has fallen 7p to \u00a310.18. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The idea of $20 oil is being tabled once again and this could well see those questions being repeated as to exact value that sits in the BG Group acquisition. Outsourcing group Serco has slid nearly 8% to 105.6p after it warned on 2016 revenues and profits, due to the sale of an offshore call centre business and the loss of a number of contracts.",

      "bodyText": "Serco has warned that next year\u2019s profits will be less than expected after the troubled government outsourcing operator sold its offshore call centre business and failed to replace some lost contracts. Underlying trading profit next year will be about \u00a350m compared with analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of \u00a369m. Revenue is likely to fall by about 20% to \u00a32.8bn, Serco said in a trading update on Monday. For 2015, underlying trading profit will be \u00a35m higher than the company\u2019s earlier forecast of about \u00a390m. Serco agreed to sell its Indian business processing outsourcing (BPO) arm to the private equity firm Blackstone in September to refocus on public sector contracts in the UK and US. The absence of that BPO next year will reduce profit by about \u00a320m and revenue by \u00a3300m, Serco said. Combined with other losses of income, mainly in the US, revenue will be about \u00a3700m less next year than the \u00a33.5bn expected this year. The company\u2019s shares fell more than 13% in early trading on Monday to 99.5p. They have lost about a third of their value this year. Serco makes about a quarter of its money from the British government and is trying to recover from a series of problems with government contracts, including overcharging the UK for monitoring criminals and mismanaging an out of hours health centre in Cornwall. Rupert Soames, who took over as chief executive in May 2014 to fix the business, said: \u201cThe news for 2015 is fine. As far as 2016 is concerned, analysts had a higher number. We\u2019ve had this big disposal of the BPO business and it was quite difficult what the impact of that would be.\u201d Soames said the general election in May had meant a shortage of new work in the UK for Serco and that expected new contracts would take time to bring in money. \u201cThere is always a slowdown in the awarding of new contracts before an election. There was very little awarded in the six months in front of the election and then everyone was on hold for the comprehensive spending review,\u201d he said. Soames has repaired relations with the UK government, which had barred Serco and its rival G4S from new government outsourced work after the scandal over offender tagging contracts. He has pledged to turn around operating performance by cutting costs, raising standards and getting out of peripheral businesses. He said there was a pipeline of government work in Serco\u2019s \u201csweet spots\u201d including work for the Ministry of Defence and the decision by Michael Gove, the justice secretary, to build nine new prisons. Soames said it was highly likely Serco would get more work for the government in enforcing border controls and managing immigration amid heightened fears following the terrorist attacks on Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not unhelpful\u201d to Serco, he said. The prison watchdog criticised Serco\u2019s management of the Yarls Wood detention centre for immigrants this year and the company recently apologised for using a stretch limousine to transport some asylum seekers from London to Manchester.",

      "bodyText": "Personal liability laws for company directors whose business ventures fail will be relaxed in a bid to encourage investors to take more risks with new ventures, as part of a $1.1bn innovation package announced on Monday. The package includes wide-ranging tax changes to promote investment in the early stages of research and development projects. Investors will received a 20% tax offset on investments in startups, capped at $200,000 per investor per year, and a 10-year exemption on capital gains tax, provided investments are held for three years. The tax incentives will cost the government $106m over five years. Insolvency laws that \u201cfocus on penalising and stigmatising business failure\u201d would be changed to encourage investors to put money into more risky ventures, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said. The default bankruptcy period will be reduced from three years to 12 months, and a \u201csafe harbour\u201d will be introduced to protect company directors from personal liability for insolvent trading if they appoint a professional restructuring adviser to turn the business\u2019s fortunes around. Malcolm Turnbull said insolvency laws were weighted too heavily towards protecting secured creditors. The changes would ensure \u201cgreater business continuity\u201d, the prime minister said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t release directors from any of their obligations,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a long overdue \u2026 and worthwhile change.\u201d Turnbull admitted the changes to bankruptcy laws could carry a risk for the government if overused or misused by company directors. \u201cOne of the aspects of the political paradigm I\u2019m seeking to change is the old politics where politicians felt they had to guarantee that every policy would work. They had to water everything down so there was no element of risk. Let me tell you: I\u2019m not guaranteeing that all of these policies will be as successful as we hope they will be,\u201d the prime minister told reporters. \u201cIf some of these policies are not as successful as we like, we will change them. We will learn from them. Because that is what a 21st century government has got to be. It has got to be as agile as the startup businesses it seeks to inspire.\u201d Turnbull said that even if businesses fail, lessons can be learned from their attempts. \u201cWe want to be a culture, a national culture of innovation, of risk-taking, because as we do that, we grow the whole ecosystem of innovation right across the economy,\u201d he said. The package includes $30m over five years for a new cyber security growth centre. The government will change laws to allow the private sector to access \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d public data to create new products and services. An extra $90m will go towards the CSIRO, but the new money does not match the $115m taken out of the organisation since the Coalition came to power in 2013. Labor\u2019s spokesman for digital innovation and startups, Ed Husic, told Sky News that the industry was smarting from budget cuts. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a massive game of catchup after two years of Coalition cuts in this area, to CSIRO,\u201d he said. Labor had also cut funding to the scientific research body when it was in office, but Husic did not guarantee reinstating the money, saying the opposition would need to see the \u201ctrue state of the budget\u201d before making that commitment. Women in science, technology, engineering and maths will receive a boost of $13m over the forward estimates. Morrison told Macquarie Radio on Monday morning the $1.1bn in the package would be offset in the mid-year economic forecast, to be announced next week. The details of the funding, including whether money came out of existing programs and organisations to fund the $1.1bn commitment, would be announced in next week\u2019s Myefo statement.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers expect 2015 to be their worst year for growth since 2009 and next year will be little better, according to a survey which highlights the dilemma that the Bank of England faces as it considers whether to raise interest rates. A survey by the EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 association, found that only car companies and chemicals firms remained buoyant while the rest of the manufacturing sector warned it expected output and employment to stagnate. Firms blamed a slowdown in China and a lack of orders from continental Europe for the 0.1% contraction in 2015 after they registered the fourth consecutive quarter of slowing growth. The industry expects growth to return in 2016, though the outlook is weak and growth is only forecast at 0.8%. The weak state of manufacturing output, which remains below pre-crash levels, will pose a dilemma for Bank of England rate-setters who meet this week amid concerns that higher rates will encourage an influx of funds to the UK, pushing up the value of the pound. Sterling has already risen by 7% this year against a basket of currencies and by almost 20% against the euro, hitting exports and making imports cheaper. Recent figures have shown a surge in imports as foreign firms find their products sell more cheaply in the UK. A further rise in the value of sterling will only make it more difficult for UK firms to sell abroad and make them reliant on domestic consumer demand for sales growth. Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, has been warningfor many months that interest rates will start to rise off their record low of 0.5% but has hinted that the weakening outlook for global growth would delay a rate rise until late next year. His view was supported by the newest member of the monetary policy committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, who said the tightening effect of the strong pound on UK monetary policy was \u201chuge\u201d. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve is preparing the path for a tightening of monetary policy after its chair, Janet Yellen, indicated to Congress last week that policymakers are likely to vote to raise US interest rates at the next policy meeting on 15-16 December. The central bankers\u2019 bank \u2013 the Bank for International Settlements \u2013 said on Sunday that an \u201cuneasy calm\u201d prevails in financial markets about the first increase in US interest rates in almost a decade. The EEF said its survey showed manufacturing growth would not help to boost UK growth. Lee Hopley, EEF chief economist, said: \u201cThe prospect of manufacturing contributing to growth in the UK economy this year has all but faded away with another disappointing set of indicators from our survey. \u201cThe downbeat mood may not be universal across all industry sectors, but it certainly seems to be spreading as the challenges have mounted through this year \u2013 from the collapse in the oil price, slower world trade growth and weaker than expected construction activity,\u201d she said. The fall in oil prices from more than $110 a barrel to below $45 a barrel over the last 18 months triggered a collapse in output in the North Sea oil industry. Layoffs in Aberdeen and oil rig maintenance firms have hurt the Scottish economy and the exchequers\u2019 expected tax receipts. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThe manufacturing sector has had a pretty torrid 2015 as it has been particularly hampered by the strong pound and lacklustre global growth hitting export orders. \u201cHowever, there have been some recent signs that the sector may be returning to modest growth after output contracted through the first three quarters of 2015,\u201d he added. Official figures for the manufacturing sector due on Tuesday are forecast to show modest growth in November, mostly due to resilient domestic demand. However, firms reported slowing orders from UK clients going into 2016 after the EEF\u2019s UK orders balance, which offsets the number of firms reporting a rise against those that report a fall, recorded another negative quarter and confidence about UK economic outlook in next 12 months took a knock. The output balance fell in the last quarter to -12%, its lowest level since the third quarter of 2009, and the order book balance fell by 19%. Hopley said: \u201cWhile the chancellor\u2019s recent spending review will have been seen as supportive to industry, it is critical that the government continues to act to ensure the UK is a competitive location for manufacturing.\u201d The Department for Business said: \u201cThe difficult conditions in the global economy affecting manufacturers and others makes it more important than ever that we stick to our long-term economic plan for sustainable growth.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Homebuyers in England and Wales are typically paying \u00a34,500 less in stamp duty than before the government overhauled the system a year ago, according to research by Halifax. The switch from a \u201cslab\u201d structure to a progressive tax, where buyers only pay each higher rate of tax on the portion of the price that goes over each threshold, was the surprise measure in 2014\u2019s autumn statement. The change, which benefits anyone spending less than \u00a3938,000 on a property, has reduced the bill on an average-priced house by more than half, the UK\u2019s largest lender said. Buyers who spend \u00a3273,531 on a home \u2013 the average price drawn from data from Halifax, HMRC and Land Registry \u2013 now face a bill of \u00a33,676, compared with \u00a38,205 under the old system. The bank said the change had made an impact on sales at the top end of the market, with the number of transactions on homes costing more than \u00a31.5m dropping by 20%, compared with a 10% fall in sales below the \u00a3938,000 level. Had the \u00a3125,000 threshold at which the duty starts risen in line with house prices since it was set in 2006, it would now stand at \u00a3157,000. Between August and October across England and Wales, just under a third of purchases by first-time buyers were of homes costing less than \u00a3125,000, so there was no stamp duty to pay. However, in London not a single first-time buyer purchase was free of stamp duty, and the average price paid by new entrants to the market was \u00a3381,022. During 2014-15, UK homebuyers paid a total of \u00a37.5bn in stamp duty, Halifax said, comfortably more than the previous record of \u00a36.7bn in the housing boom of 2007-08. The increase has been driven by rising prices, particularly in London, where stamp duty receipts were just over \u00a33bn during the year, compared with \u00a31.9bn in 2007-08. Craig McKinlay, the mortgages director at Halifax, said the changes made to stamp duty a year ago had been of significant benefit to many buyers. However, he added: \u201cThe failure to index the start point for stamp duty in line with house price inflation has dragged more buyers into the tax net in recent years.Buyers in London have been particularly badly affected with the capital accounting for an increasing and disproportionately large share of stamp duty revenues.\u201d",
