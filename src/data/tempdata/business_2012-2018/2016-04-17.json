      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive and founder of advertising giant WPP, has launched a passionate defence of his controversial \u00a363m bonus deal in the wake of last week\u2019s explosive start to the annual general meeting season. Speaking after shareholders voted against pay deals at BP and Smith &amp; Nephew on Thursday \u2013 and as boardrooms are on high alert for a potential revival of the 2012 \u201cshareholder spring\u201d when scores of investors rebelled over executive pay \u2013 Sorrell told the Press Association: \u201cMost of my wealth, if not all of it, is and has been for the last 31 years tied up in the success of WPP. So if WPP does well, I do well, and others in the company do well. If we do badly, we suffer.\u201d The comments came as Centrica, the owner of British Gas, holds its annual general meeting on Monday, after suffering a significant pay protest last year. Big City investors are also scrutinising the pay deals at a wide-range of FTSE 100 companies including mining company Anglo American and building products group CRH, as well as WPP. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, told the Financial Times that shareholders now faced a \u201cdefining moment\u201d in curbing excessive pay. In March, the advertising firm revealed that Sorrell collected what is believed to be the second-largest package granted to a FTSE 100 chief executive, behind only the \u00a392m in shares and cash paid to Bart Becht while he was chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser in 2009. The \u00a363m figure is likely to eventually hit \u00a370m, when WPP publishes its annual report later this month, which will include Sorrell\u2019s salary and other payments on top of the shares. Sorrell said his share award \u2013 which is topped up by a \u00a31.15m salary \u2013 was \u201cvoted through by shareholders by considerable majorities\u201d. \u201cThe fact is, those plans were put in place, they were voted on, they were approved. The only reason the plans have resulted in what they\u2019ve resulted in is because the company has done well,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past four or five years, the company\u2019s market cap has grown by about \u00a310bn. So if it\u2019s our [sic] nostra culpa for having a successful company ... I make no apologies for that. The better the results, the better the people do.\u201d Although WPP shares have more than doubled in the past four years the shareholder lobby group Pirc described the award as \u201cexcessive\u201d. Sorrell\u2019s package dates back to a scheme that the company called its \u201cleadership equity acquisition plan\u201d (LEAP), which was introduced in 2009. In 2012, investors revolted against WPP\u2019s remuneration report. The company ended the LEAP scheme in 2013 and Sorrell accepted cuts to his pay and potential bonus payout. However, WPP continues to honour potential payouts under the LEAP plan, which has a further year to run. Asked if he feared another rebellion at this year\u2019s AGM in June, Sorrell said: \u201cWe have shareholder votes every year. It is what it is. Shareholders will decide. It\u2019s very democratic. We\u2019re always engaged with shareholders with anything and everything.\u201d The AGM season has started with several rebellions against pay. On Thursday, almost 60% of BP shareholders rejected the oil giant\u2019s remuneration report, which awarded boss Bob Dudley \u00a314m. Just hours later, more than 50% of investors voted against pay deals at the medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew. The boards of other firms such including AstraZeneca and Reckitt Benckiser, where the pay of the chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor, almost doubled to \u00a323m last year, could face potential rebellions over pay at their AGMs. HSBC will become the first major bank to hold its annual meeting this year. On Friday it is expected to face questions about executive pay and succession planning \u2013 the chairman, Douglas Flint, is to step down next year \u2013 and its links to Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the centre of the Panama Papers.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The average asking price of homes coming on to the market has risen to a new high, increasing by 1.3% over the past month to an average of \u00a3307,033 as landlords raced to buy properties ahead of an increase in stamp duty. According to the property website Rightmove, the change to stamp duty on 1 April helped \u201cignite an onward chain reaction\u201d, with landlords snapping up homes at the bottom of the ladder and former owners moving on. The average asking price for properties typically bought by first-time buyers was down by 1.4% over the month to \u00a3182,926, when inner London was excluded, but there were rises in the price tags of larger homes. The asking price for three- and four-bedroom properties newly listed in April was up by 0.6% on the previous month, at \u00a3257,871, while at the top of the ladder homes with at least five bedrooms and four-bed detached properties, were being marketed for 1.9% more than in March, at an average of \u00a3546,232. Rightmove\u2019s figures, which are based on homes listed on the site during the past four weeks, show that sellers in all parts of England and Wales are asking more for their homes than those marketing their properties in April 2015. The largest annual increase was recorded in the east of England, where the average asking price is up by 10.8% at \u00a3331,780, closely followed by the south-east and then London. In the capital, the average new asking price has risen by \u00a351,615 over the past year, to \u00a3646,200. The cheapest region is the north-east, where the average asking price is up by 3.5% year-on-year at \u00a3151,459. A clutch of reports have shown that 2016 got off to a busy start in the housing market as investors tried to complete deals ahead of the introduction of the three percentage point surcharge on stamp duty on second homes from 1 April. This change means buying a \u00a3182,926 property will cost an investor almost \u00a35,500 more than a first-time buyer. Rightmove said the lower rungs of the property ladder, properties with two bedrooms or fewer, had in recent years seen high demand from both first-time buyers and buy-to-let investors, creating upwards price pressure. Even though demand had dissipated, it said, the momentum it created appears to have enabled owner-occupiers to trade up, creating demand for more expensive homes. Rightmove director Miles Shipside said: \u201cThere\u2019s a whole army of aspiring first-time buyers keen to get on the ladder and they now have a 3% price advantage over the formerly more agile legion of landlords, some of whom have retreated for the time being. \u201cFirst-time buyers could fill some of the gap but sellers of properties with two bedrooms or fewer need to realise that with less overall demand they need to price cheaper to match first-time buyers and highly taxed investors.\u201d First-time buyers struggling to raise a deposit could reduce the amount of time it takes by at least half by moving back in with their parents, property firm Hamptons International has calculated. A couple saving for a 15% deposit across England and Wales would be able to save enough in 21 months if they lived rent-free with family, compared with three-and-a-half years if they faced rent and housing costs, the firm said. In London, living rent-free would enable them to accumulate a deposit in 2.75 years, compared with seven-and-a-half years in their own home. A single buyer in London could reduce their saving time by 33 years, it claimed, to seven-and-a-half.",

      "bodyText": "Last week, the Guardian published a long read about the pharmacy chain Boots, detailing allegations from staff of how the business pressures its chemists to milk the NHS for cash, compels them to sacrifice professional ethics for demanding business targets and to work in conditions that they believe pose a threat to patients. The sharpest change, in the eyes of Boots\u2019 own staff, began in 2007, when the company was bought by private equity firm KKR and billionaire Monaco tax exile Stefano Pessina. In our report, employees and experts alleged that the new owners had changed, almost beyond recognition, both the priorities and the culture of what had once been a family run, Methodist firm. Boots denied all the allegations, saying: \u201cOffering care for our colleagues, customers and the communities which we serve \u2026 is an integral part of our strategy.\u201d Boots is a British institution, the country\u2019s biggest pharmacy \u2013 and here were its own staff charging it with sucking money from the public purse, endangering patients and harming employees. Within hours of publication, the Guardian was flooded with emails, many from pharmacists. The letters editor believes this may be the largest haul of mail he has ever received about a single article. Others rang in. Some may have been invited to write in by their trade union but the letters are not pro forma \u2013 they\u2019re from Boots, non-Boots and ex-Boots pharmacists, and they give their individual experience and opinions. Some stress the point made in the piece that smaller rival pharmacists are now adopting some of the same practices. Among this unprecedented slew of mail, none accuse the piece of exaggeration. Indeed the opposite. The fear of reprisals runs deep and wide. The overwhelming majority of correspondents wanted their details withheld: \u201cPlease I would like to stay anonymous as I can\u2019t afford to risk a jobloss [sic] as I have a family to feed.\u201d One long-serving Boots pharmacist wrote: \u201cI shared your article on Facebook and was telephoned immediately by my manager and told to delete it.\u201d The letters are an extraordinary firsthand testimony from a profession under acute pressure. Here, we publish extracts from just a few of them. These are the voices never heard, from people rarely seen \u2013 literally, the backroom staff of medicine. Respecting the writers\u2019 wish for anonymity, we are keeping their details private. But they are sounding the alarm on what they see as a crisis at Boots, and in healthcare. Patients put in danger \u2022 \u201cI think that Boots has now reached a state where things are becoming dangerous. I often worry that I have missed something and there will be a dispensing error, sometimes it stops me from sleeping.\u201d \u2022 \u201cLast year alone, my manager specifically asked me to work in a very busy store all week on my own ... She made it clear that she had discussed this with the area manager and that was the right decision. When I challenged her on the potential risk it was to patient safety and my own personal health. She replied I \u2018always use patient safety as an excuse to get out of jobs\u2019.\u201d \u2022 \u201cPatient safety is severely compromised as pharmacists are asked to clinically check prescriptions while ensuring people are being served at the tills, taking phone calls, giving advice to patients, handing out prescriptions, re-ordering medication for patients, texting patients, storing prescriptions, recording clinical information, etc. Self-checking, which should only be done as a \u2018last resort\u2019 is actually done on a daily basis. Having two people involved in the dispensing and checking of a prescription is a fundamental hallmark of safe dispensing, which Boots is not taking seriously. Under pressure to meet several targets \u2026 in a Boots pharmacy it is extremely difficult to counsel a patient fully on how to use their medication correctly and how to get the most out of their medication, there is simply not a time provision for this.\u201d Milking the NHS The investigation uncovered evidence that Boots managers were directing chemists to give medicine-use reviews (MURs) to customers who didn\u2019t need them, for company profit. The NHS pays \u00a328 for each MUR, which is supposed to give patients professional advice on health, diet and how best to manage their medicines. Each pharmacy is limited to 400 per year, but many branches of Boots (and, it is alleged, other chains) take that as a target \u2013 in order to squeeze the maximum out of the public purse. \u2022 \u201cI strongly agree that MURs are being abused as a way to make money rather than their primary purpose to help patients. Pharmacists are under huge pressure to do 400 a year. Professional autonomy is being crushed.\u201d \u2022 \u201cI no longer work in pharmacy sector but can confirm that Boots was amongst the most aggressive in pressurising its pharmacists to do a certain number of MURs per day. I recall many occasions when as a locum I would have area managers (often with no clinical/medical training) calling branches to ask how many MURs had been done and if a certain number hadn\u2019t been met why not and that it wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d \u2022 \u201cWe dream MURs, we have nightmares about MURs. Trying to justify the pressure by saying we need to do this for our patients is a load of rubbish. Yes, the idea behind them is great and we should be doing them \u2013 for free when needed as our moral, ethical and professional standing demands.\u201d \u2022 \u201cA few months ago I told my area manager we had been doing extremely well with our stop smoking service, and his response was, that\u2019s brilliant but we need to push MURs and NMS [new medicine service] as they are pure profitable services whereas with stop smoking, it is not as profitable when you take into account the products we are providing to our patients.\u201d Pharmacists under pressure \u2022 \u201cWorking for Boots is making people ill. They have an anonymous survey of staff opinions and I am sure people tell them; I certainly have, but nothing ever changes. Profit appears to matter much more than health and safety of customers or duty of care toward staff. I have had many sleepless nights worrying about the safety of the patients. If you complain you are seen as a trouble maker, or inadequate, and basically told to get on with it! I have sat and cried because of the stress and worry many times. At one point I even considered suicide because I could not see any way out of the situation. I know of others who have said they felt the same.\u201d \u2022 \u201cI lasted 20 months [at Boots]. I worked myself into the ground, lost weight and for a large part of it I survived on anti-depressants and sleeping tablets, having had no significant health problems in the past. The lack of sleep was very profound and by far the worst symptom, as this undermined my stamina, concentration, emotional stability (I was crying at the drop of a hat) and general ability to function. It was the constant pressure to \u2018perform\u2019, meet targets, and fill \u2018expectations\u2019 all dressed up to make everyone \u2018Feel Good\u2019.\u201d \u2022 \u201cI joined Boots after my university studies \u2026 and found out how it was the worst place for me to work for. I did a professional medical degree, not a sales degree, but felt I was only appreciated if I hit the targets ... Some of the customers don\u2019t even need the services but the pharmacists feel so pressurised that they do it just to hit the targets, despite compromising patients\u2019 health. I always worked in an understaffed environment ... I felt constant pressure and eventually had to leave due to depression.\u201d \u2022 \u201cI am not allowed to just BE a pharmacist \u2013 what I have trained for and used to love so much. I am a money-making object.\u201d \u2022 \u201cI am a passionate pharmacist and love doing my job so that I can help patients and provide a brilliant service to them. However with the ongoing, worsening and unrealistic budget cuts, we are working on skeleton staff every day just battling to survive. We can no longer give even a half decent service even if we wish to. What is worse is that staff are taken away and more is expected of you in terms of targets, services! How can you cope? They are setting you up for failure even before you have begun. I wake up in the morning dreading work.\u201d [signed \u201cA disappointed, tired and stressed Boots pharmacist\u201d] \u2022 \u201cI was proud to work for Boots as a pharmacist and as a manager across many stores from 1981 until 2004. My patients and my people came first \u2013 before commercial targets \u2013 and I was valued, as was my profession. I returned to employment with Boots in 2009 and found a massive change in priorities. One of the most significant drivers in the change of culture at grassroots level seemed to be the move from employing pharmacists as senior managers to the current situation where many managers are unqualified, have lower levels of education and are obviously employed at lower cost. The difference in priorities makes it almost impossible for professional and ethical concerns to be considered appropriately in the face of profit targets.\u201d \u2022 \u201cAfter Boots was bought [in 2007 by Pessina/KKR], the staffing was radically reduced and I was constantly having to self check. I lost a well-trained dispensing assistant who also covered the medicines counter, in favour of a general sales assistant with no medicines experience. So my day was spent dispensing, answering the phone, offering advice, all whilst listening to what the new counter girl was selling and having to intervene on a regular basis. Oh yes, I forgot to mention the relentless targets for everything whilst having insufficient support staff and a consultation room at the opposite end of the shop to the pharmacy.\u201d [Resigned in 2014 after working in a Boots branch for 11 years]",

      "bodyText": "Boots faces the prospect of an investigation by the pharmacy watchdog, following a Guardian investigation into the multibillion pound chain. The General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) is calling in evidence on the allegations made in the report, which revealed that managers at Britain\u2019s biggest chain of chemists have been forcing staff to milk NHS schemes, in order to increase company profits. The report also detailed a recent and yet to be published survey by the pharmacy trade union of its members, to which more than one in 10 of all Boots chemists responded. Asked \u201chow often do you believe financial cutbacks imposed by your main employer have directly impacted upon patient safety?\u201d, more than 75% of those who responded to the Pharmacists\u2019 Defence Association (PDA) said that was the case at least half the time. The union has been asked to show the pharmacy regulator its survey and other relevant documents, in what are understood to be the first steps towards a possible full investigation of Boots. The regulator said on Sunday night: \u201cOur standards are clear that pharmacy owners have a responsibility to enable their staff to make the care of patients their first priority and to raise concerns with the relevant authority about any issue that may affect patient care or public safety.\u201d But it was attacked by the PDA for being far too slow to act on the business culture at Boots. \u201cThe GPhC must be aware of the extent to which the undermining of the professionalism of pharmacists is a significant problem, not least because we have repeatedly told them about it,\u201d said Mark Pitt, the union\u2019s assistant general secretary. He added that since the watchdog was established in 2010, its officials have been regularly updated by the PDA on the problems at Boots \u2013 but that no action taken. The regulator has also approached the Guardian for information. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the professional members\u2019 body for chemists, has also responded with alarm to the Guardian report, saying the paper\u2019s allegations \u201cwill make difficult reading for many in the sector\u201d. The RPS is especially concerned by allegations that NHS schemes, such as the Medicine Use Reviews (MUR) and New Medicine Service, are being exploited by Boots managers for the public money the schemes pay out. The NHS pays \u00a328 for each MUR, which is intended to give sick patients professional advice on medicine and diet. But the Guardian discovered that Boots managers were pressuring pharmacists to carry them out on people who did not need or want them \u2013 and even to give them to other staff members. If the chain carries out the limit of 400 MURs at each of its pharmacies, it stands to make about \u00a330m from the scheme. Staff who have questioned or resisted the alleged misuse of the MUR system report that their pay and career prospects have suffered. All allegations were denied by Boots. It said: \u201cWe make it clear to our colleagues that these services should not be undertaken inappropriately.\u201d Sandra Gidley, who chairs the English pharmacy board of the RPS, said: \u201cThere is an urgent need to address the issue of target setting and unacceptable commercial pressures within large company settings. Individual pharmacists must have professional autonomy when providing patient care wherever they are working.\u201d She confirmed that the newspaper\u2019s allegations that understaffing at Boots is threatening patient safety had also been raised with the RPS by its members. Within hours of the Guardian publishing the investigation, Boots staff received two messages from senior managers. The newspaper has seen both. The first, from the director of retail pharmacy operations, Kevin Birch, attacked the Guardian for \u201ca very specific and strong negative agenda\u201d. He also directs staff that if asked by customers about the allegations, \u201cplease reassure them we take patient safety seriously\u201d before putting them \u201cin touch with the customer care team\u201d. In a second note, the chief pharmacist at Boots, Marc Donovan, advised the chain\u2019s pharmacists: \u201cServices must be for the benefit of patients, not the attainment of numerical targets.\u201d Boots\u2019 pharmacists who contacted the Guardian about the note argued there was a wide gulf between company policy and their experience on the shop floor. One simply described Boots\u2019 note as \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d.",

Ofwat said that while the option to switch would not be open to consumers, a review was under way to investigate whether competition in the market should be opened up to benefit households. Ofwat will give initial thoughts on the matter in the summer, but the government would ultimately make the decision on competition in the water market for consumers. The regulator, Defra and MOSL have a year to communicate the changes to businesses, to encourage them to benefit from the changes.

      "bodyText": "With forklift trucks carrying pallets of fruit and vegetables between sellers, and voices from all corners of the world shouting at each other, New Covent Garden market can be an intimidating place in the early hours of the morning. But this is where environmental enthusiasts Ilana Taub and Michael Minch-Dixon found inspiration for an idea to use goods that would otherwise be thrown out to make a snack consisting of apples, bananas, mangoes and other produce. The pair are using fruit deemed unsuitable for supermarkets or which is overproduced to make three different flavours in their Snact range, intended as both a healthy alternative to chocolate bars and as part-solution to the millions of tonnes of fruit and vegetables wasted each year. \u201cIf [the market traders] were about to get a new consignment of produce coming in then they will often discard the produce that they have. Or if there is a couple of mouldy raspberries in a punnet, they will throw away the whole tray, so we would go and sort out the produce,\u201d says Minch-Dixon. The two friends met at school in Brussels, where their families were based, and both afterwards embarked on separate careers in sustainability. They came together in 2012 to try to find an idea for a food business that would tackle some of the mountain of goods wasted every day. The UN estimates that each year 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of the total produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables. In the food markets they found fruit they could use as it could not be sold because of seemingly minor problems, such as ageing in bananas. Taub then came across the idea for \u201cfruit leather\u201d after finding a reference from the historian Dorothy Hartley to a recipe dating from 1700 for quince comfits \u2013 the equivalent of fruit pastilles \u2013 which require a mixture as \u201cstiff as candied fruit leather\u201d. The outcome is a pliable and chewy fruit snack sold in 20g bags of three flavours: apple and raspberry; apple and mango; and apple, blueberry and banana, with all the ingredients sourced from fruit that would otherwise have been discarded. The fruit is blended, spread out and dried in a dehydrator for eight hours before being cut into small pieces. \u201cWe take whole fresh apples and we blend them up and put them through a sieve so the stalks and seeds are taken out but everything else is there. We add in the purees of the different fruits or the whole bananas get chucked in as well. We try and use as much of the fruit as possible both so that we reduce waste but also apple skins are healthy and they have nutrients in them,\u201d says Minch-Dixon. Preserving the shelf life of food is not new. But, adds Minch-Dixon: \u201cThe innovative idea is the relationship that we have with farmers and trying to think how can we revalue the fruit. Where people see something which does not have enough value to use or harvest, we think that if we turn it into something healthy and delicious, we can add more value to it. So we can buy more produce from the farmers or we can incentivise the pack houses to change their sorting process so that they send stuff to us.\u201d The fruit is sourced from farmers in Kent and includes apples which may have been harvested but do not have a buyer due to oversupply. One batch of organic apples, for instance, could not be sold conventionally because they were slightly too small for the supermarket buyer. Other apples may be left on trees as there is no demand, so Snact pays for the labour to harvest them, spending slightly more to give the farmer a financial incentive. The fruits used are not spoiled, but instead come from a window of production where they cannot be sold. \u201cIn no way are we trying to use the rotten piles of fruit, and there is so much good produce to be used that you don\u2019t have to go to that side,\u201d says Minch-Dixon. Retailing at \u00a31 a bag, Snact is a similar price to other goods of its kindeven though the fruit costs between 20% and 40% of the usual price. This, says Minch-Dixon, is because the food component cost of these products accounts for a small proportion of the overall price. \u201cPeople often ask us, \u2018Why isn\u2019t your product cheaper than your competitors if you are getting the fruit cheaper\u2019, and the major thing is that we produce in the UK whereas most of our competitors produce in low labour cost countries. [As] the largest price component of our product is manufacturing then our product is costing us more to make than others and so it is important that we sell the added value piece [that] we are made in the UK and we are doing something that is environmentally responsible,\u201d he says. Finding a use for surplus and imperfect produce has been championed by celebrity chefs such as Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. In February, Asda started selling a wonky veg box for produce which is misshapen, has growth cracks or is smaller or larger than usually required. \u201cShould it ever get to the point where there is no food waste for us to access \u2013 hooray, we have succeeded and then we will move on to the next environmental challenge,\u201d says Minch-Dixon. \u2022You can read our archive of Innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website, where you will find more information on how the centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and elsewhere.",

The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/mb060e/mb060e.pdf\">UN estimates</a> that each year 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of the total produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/15/supermarkets-pledge-to-cut-food-waste-20-by-2025\">Supermarkets pledge to cut food waste 20% by 2025</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the food markets they found fruit they could use as it could not be sold because of seemingly minor problems, such as ageing in bananas. Taub then came across the idea for \u201cfruit leather\u201d after finding a reference from the historian <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Hartley\">Dorothy Hartley</a> to a recipe dating from 1700 for quince comfits \u2013 the equivalent of fruit pastilles \u2013 which require a mixture as \u201cstiff as candied fruit leather\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The outcome is a pliable and chewy fruit snack sold in 20g bags of three flavours: apple and raspberry; apple and mango; and apple, blueberry and banana, with all the ingredients sourced from fruit that would otherwise have been discarded. The fruit is blended, spread out and dried in a dehydrator for eight hours before being cut into small pieces.</p> <p>\u201cWe take whole fresh apples and we blend them up and put them through a sieve so the stalks and seeds are taken out but everything else is there. We add in the purees of the different fruits or the whole bananas get chucked in as well. We try and use as much of the fruit as possible both so that we reduce waste but also apple skins are healthy and they have nutrients in them,\u201d says Minch-Dixon.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a941829d6b60518b1af7fca71b0069b21bc6f9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a941829d6b60518b1af7fca71b0069b21bc6f9f/0_118_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harvesting apples in Kent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harvesting apples in Kent.

But, adds Minch-Dixon: \u201cThe innovative idea is the relationship that we have with farmers and trying to think how can we revalue the fruit. Where people see something which does not have enough value to use or harvest, we think that if we turn it into something healthy and delicious, we can add more value to it. So we can buy more produce from the farmers or we can incentivise the pack houses to change their sorting process so that they send stuff to us.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The fruit is sourced from farmers in Kent and includes apples which may have been harvested but do not have a buyer due to oversupply. One batch of organic apples, for instance, could not be sold conventionally because they were slightly too small for the supermarket buyer. Other apples may be left on trees as there is no demand, so Snact pays for the labour to harvest them, spending slightly more to give the farmer a financial incentive. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/20/theres-nothing-wrong-with-a-bit-of-mould-chefs-on-food-waste-and-using-leftovers\">\u2018There\u2019s nothing wrong with a bit of mould\u2019: chefs on food waste and using leftovers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fruits used are not spoiled, but instead come from a window of production where they cannot be sold. \u201cIn no way are we trying to use the rotten piles of fruit, and there is so much good produce to be used that you don\u2019t have to go to that side,\u201d says Minch-Dixon.</p> <p>Retailing at \u00a31 a bag, Snact is a similar price to other goods of its kindeven though the fruit costs between 20% and 40% of the usual price.

      "bodyText": "All is calm. All is still. Share prices are going up. Oil prices are rising. China has stabilised. The eurozone is over the worst. After a panicky start to 2016, investors have decided that things aren\u2019t so bad after all. Put your ear to the ground though, and it is possible to hear the blades whirring. Far away, preparations are being made for helicopter drops of money onto the global economy. With due honour to one of Humphrey Bogart\u2019s many great lines from Casablanca: \u201cMaybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but soon.\u201d But isn\u2019t it true that action by Beijing has boosted activity in China, helping to push oil prices back above $40 a barrel? Has Mario Draghi not announced a fresh stimulus package from the European Central Bank designed to remove the threat of deflation? Are hundreds of thousands of jobs not being created in the US each month? In each case, the answer is yes. China\u2019s economy appears to have bottomed out. Fears of a $20 oil price have receded. Prices have stopped falling in the eurozone. Employment growth has continued in the US. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting growth in the global economy of just over 3% this year \u2013 nothing spectacular, but not a disaster either. Don\u2019t be fooled. China\u2019s growth is the result of a surge in investment and the strongest credit growth in almost two years. There has been a return to a model that burdened the country with excess manufacturing capacity, a property bubble and a rising number of non-performing loans. The economy has been stabilised, but at a cost. The upward trend in oil prices also looks brittle. The fundamentals of the market - supply continues to exceed demand - have not changed. Then there\u2019s the US. Here there are two problems \u2013 one glaringly apparent, the other lurking in the shadows. The overt weakness is that real incomes continue to be squeezed, despite the fall in unemployment. Americans are finding that wages are barely keeping pace with prices, and that the amount left over for discretionary spending is being eaten into by higher rents and medical bills. For a while, consumer spending was kept going because rock-bottom interest rates allowed auto dealers to offer tempting terms to those of limited means wanting to buy a new car or truck. In an echo of the subprime real estate crisis, vehicle sales are now falling. The hidden problem has been highlighted by Andrew Lapthorne of the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Companies have exploited the Federal Reserve\u2019s low interest-rate regime to load up on debt they don\u2019t actually need. \u201cThe proceeds of this debt raising are then largely reinvested back into the equity market via M&amp;A or share buybacks in an attempt to boost share prices in the absence of actual demand,\u201d Lapthorne says. \u201cThe effect on US non-financial balance sheets is now starting to look devastating.\u201d He adds that the trigger for a US corporate debt crisis would be falling share prices, something that might easily be caused by the Fed increasing interest rates. . So that\u2019s China and the US. How are the other two members of the \u201cbig four\u201d \u2013 the eurozone and Japan \u2013 faring? The answer is not so well. Europe\u2019s big problem, over and above the fact that the euro was a disastrously flawed concept, is that the banking system is not fit for purpose. As the IMF noted last week, a third of eurozone banks have no prospect of being profitable without urgent and meaningful reform. That requires two things: to reduce the number of banks and to do something about the \u20ac900bn (\u00a3715bn) of bad loans sitting on their books at the end of 2014. There is no immediate prospect of either happening, which makes it much harder for Draghi to get any traction with his stimulus package. The plan is that negative interest rates and quantitative easing will increase the incentives for eurozone commercial banks to lend more. The banking system, however, is badly impaired and the normal channels for creating credit are blocked. The same applies to Japan, where the financial markets have responded badly to the announcement of negative interest rates earlier this year. As in Europe, the idea was that the banks would lend more if they were penalised by negative interest rates for hoarding money. Higher lending would lead to higher levels of investment and consumption, which would in turn feed through into higher prices. The plan has not worked. There has been little impact on interest rates, banks have not increased their lending and the yen has risen on the foreign exchanges - the opposite of what was planned - because investors fear that the Bank of Japan is fast running out of ammunition. They have a point. Central banks, of course, swear blind that they are fully in control and that there is nothing to worry about. Perhaps not, but something doesn\u2019t smell right. The fact that economists at Deutsche Bank published a helpful cut-out-and-keep guide to helicopter money last week is a straw in the wind. As the Deutsche research makes clear, the most basic variant of helicopter money involves a central bank creating money so that it can be handed to the finance ministry to spend on tax cuts or higher public spending. There are two differences with QE. The cash goes directly to firms and individuals rather than being channeled through banks, and there is no intention of the central bank ever getting it back. It will take some time to get the helicopters into the air. Central banks can muddle through for the rest of this year, beefing up their QE programmes and driving interest rates deeper into negative territory. The underlying softness of the global economy, however, means that it is quite easy to envisage a downturn in 2017, the 10th anniversary of the start of the financial crisis. In those circumstances, the unconventional would quickly become conventional, as it did after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The only question would be which central bank would move first. Hardline resistance from Germany means it certainly would not be the ECB, although the case for helicopter money in the eurozone is strong. Instead, it would be a toss up between the Fed, which is normally prepared to experiment with something different if the situation is desperate enough, or the Bank of Japan, where \u2013 as the Deutsche research reminds us \u2013 helicopter money was used successfully in the 1930s to help the country escape the Great Depression with far less damage than to other western nations. So give it a few months then listen hard. The choppers are coming.",

      "bodyText": "When Tom Hiddleston\u2019s character, Jonathan Pine, sauntered through some Arab spring uprising at the beginning of the BBC\u2019s The Night Manager, it was tempting to view the scene as a lampooning of the 2012 \u201cshareholder spring\u201d. That was the series of equally courageous revolutions against, er, executive pay, bringing us once again the implausible alignment of rebellions notable for overthrowing repressive regimes with some well-tailored smoothy-chops strolling practically untouched through staged carnage. Without wanting to appear unreasonably churlish, the BBC is almost certainly now conducting a review to discover what happened to the scene featuring men in flash suits, taking tea and biscuits at the QEII, and politely asking a pal to trouser slightly less loot. But let\u2019s not join that witch-hunt. The City has its own tribute. BP kicked off \u201cshareholder spring 2.0\u201d last Thursday, and this week we are braced for similar episodes at the AGMs of miner Anglo American and HSBC, where last year some wag turned up wearing a Panama hat. That looks like a very prescient joke, although you\u2019ll recall it was actually a critique of one director\u2019s pay. HSBC, of course, is the bank that likes to say yes, even when its chief exec asks to be paid in Panamanian balboas. Brexit battle Another week, another kerfuffle over Brexit. On Tuesday Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be giving evidence to the House of Lords economic affairs committee, where he looks certain to cause yet another row \u2013 not least because the first question being trailed is: \u201cWhat risks are there to remaining in the European Union?\u201d The governor, you may recall, made a stab at answering that one early last month during a Treasury select committee hearing. On that occasion, he ended up enraging Brexit-ers when he described transition out of the EU in the event of a leave vote as \u201cthe biggest domestic risk to financial stability\u201d. That reaction seemed rather harsh on Carney, who is actually paid to have a view on that sort of stuff, but few people are being tedious enough to allow such considerations get in the way of a good barney on the topic. As the Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie puts it: \u201cBoth sides in the referendum campaign have traded in outrageous claims and unsubstantiated assertions, masquerading as facts.\u201d Such an outrageous state of affairs must come as a complete shock to everyone in Westminster. Mid-table obscurity for Sky As Sky subscribers know well, the pay-TV channel has never knowingly under-hyped anything on its schedule. Even a League Two clash \u2013 perhaps on a blustery evening on a bobbly pitch at Meadow Lane \u2013 ends up seeming like something only extremely careless armchair fans would miss. Yet it will be interesting to see how the group plugs its latest trading figures ahead of announcing them this week. Analysts at UBS have pencilled in \u201ca steady quarter with continued solid growth in financials\u201d, which is hardly the way you might imagine Jeff Stelling plugging it. Still, for the real aficionado, there should be some commentary on a couple of European fixtures that may be worth listening to. First up, Vivendi\u2019s tie-up with Mediaset is expected to provide Sky with more competition in Italy, while the German cartel office\u2019s ruling that Bundesliga football rights cannot all be sold to one bidder, and will have to be split, has prompted some analysts to predict a bidding war, \u201cwhich would be unhelpful for Sky Deutschland\u201d. That said, the courageous experiment to insert any sort of competition into top-flight German football is to be applauded. Nobody apart from Bayern Munich (currently clear at the top once again) has won the Bundesliga title since 2012.",

      "body": "<p>When Tom Hiddleston\u2019s character, Jonathan Pine, sauntered through some Arab spring uprising at the beginning of the BBC\u2019s <em>The Night Manager</em>, it was tempting to view the scene as a lampooning of the 2012 \u201cshareholder spring\u201d.</p> <p>That was the series of equally courageous revolutions against, er, executive pay, bringing us once again the implausible alignment of rebellions notable for overthrowing repressive regimes with some well-tailored smoothy-chops strolling practically untouched through staged carnage.</p> <p>Without wanting to appear unreasonably churlish, the BBC is almost certainly now conducting a review to discover what happened to the scene featuring men in flash suits, taking tea and biscuits at the QEII, and politely asking a pal to trouser slightly less loot. But let\u2019s not join that witch-hunt. The City has its own tribute.</p> <p>BP kicked off \u201cshareholder spring 2.0\u201d last Thursday, and this week we are braced for similar episodes at the AGMs of miner Anglo American and HSBC, where last year some wag turned up wearing a Panama hat.</p> <p>That looks like a very prescient joke, although you\u2019ll recall it was actually a critique of one director\u2019s pay. HSBC, of course, is the bank that likes to say yes, even when its chief exec asks to be paid in Panamanian balboas.</p> <h2>Brexit battle<br></h2> <p>Another week, another kerfuffle over Brexit. On Tuesday Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be giving evidence to the House of Lords economic affairs committee, where he looks certain to cause yet another row \u2013 not least because the first question being trailed is: \u201cWhat risks are there to remaining in the European Union?\u201d</p> <p>The governor, you may recall, made a stab at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/08/boris-johnson-abandons-city-hall-eu-referendum-gag-after-hypocrisy-claim-politics-live\" title=\"\">answering that one early last month </a>during a Treasury select committee hearing.</p> <p>On that occasion, he ended up enraging Brexit-ers when he described transition out of the EU in the event of a leave vote as \u201cthe biggest domestic risk to financial stability\u201d.</p> <p>That reaction seemed rather harsh on Carney, who is actually paid to have a view on that sort of stuff, but few people are being tedious enough to allow such considerations get in the way of a good barney on the topic.</p> <p>As the Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie puts it: \u201cBoth sides in the referendum campaign have traded in outrageous claims and unsubstantiated assertions, masquerading as facts.\u201d</p> <p>Such an outrageous state of affairs must come as a complete shock to everyone in Westminster.</p> <h2>Mid-table obscurity for Sky<br></h2> <p>As Sky subscribers know well, the pay-TV channel has never knowingly under-hyped anything on its schedule. Even a League Two clash \u2013 perhaps on a blustery evening on a bobbly pitch at Meadow Lane \u2013 ends up seeming like something only extremely careless armchair fans would miss. Yet it will be interesting to see how the group plugs its latest trading figures ahead of announcing them this week.</p> <p>Analysts at UBS have pencilled in \u201ca steady quarter with continued solid growth in financials\u201d, which is hardly the way you might imagine Jeff Stelling plugging it. Still, for the real aficionado, there should be some commentary on a couple of European fixtures that may be worth listening to.</p> <p>First up, Vivendi\u2019s tie-up with Mediaset is expected to provide Sky with more competition in Italy, while the German cartel office\u2019s ruling that Bundesliga football rights cannot all be sold to one bidder, and will have to be split, has prompted some analysts to predict a bidding war, \u201cwhich would be unhelpful for Sky Deutschland\u201d.</p> <p>That said, the courageous experiment to insert any sort of competition into top-flight German football is to be applauded. Nobody apart from Bayern Munich (currently clear at the top once again) has won the Bundesliga title since 2012.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two FTSE 100 companies, including BP, one the biggest of the bunch, were defeated on votes on boardroom pay last week. It doesn\u2019t happen often, and the 59% revolt at BP was stunning. The company had followed its established pay formula, shown its workings and pleaded its case to normally timorous fund managers. Yet the majority of shareholders took a simple view: you\u2019ve got to be kidding if you think \u00a314m for chief executive Bob Dudley is fair. A string of other companies with annual meetings in coming weeks will now be nervous. All will have expected healthy majorities but, after BP, confidence will be dented. A defeat or two in the following list is suddenly possible: WPP, which is a serial offender in the eyes of some shareholders; miner Anglo American; Dettol-to-Nurofen group Reckitt Benckiser; and pharmaceuticals firm Shire. What\u2019s happened? The narrow explanation \u2013 and the factor which took BP by surprise \u2013 is that investors are now looking at the sheer size of some bosses\u2019 pay packets. For the past two decades \u2013 as the \u201cpay for performance\u201d mantra has dominated \u2013 companies have concentrated on designing performance yardsticks to justify soaring pay levels. The intervention of Vince Cable, business secretary in the coalition government, encouraged that thinking by introducing a forward-looking binding vote on pay policies in 2014. The idea was to make companies gain approval, in advance, for their pay parameters on a three-yearly cycle. Once everyone had agreed the rules, ran the theory, the pay game would be less contentious. Not so, it turns out. Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m adhered to BP\u2019s approved polices \u2013 targets for safety, cash flow, etc were hit \u2013 but the sheer sum of money was deemed offensive, especially when BP had made a record $6.5bn loss. In the lingo of remuneration consultants, the problem was \u201cthe quantum\u201d. About time, too. The average chief executive of a FTSE 100 company was paid \u00a34.96m in 2014, or 183 times the earnings of the average full-time UK worker, according to the High Pay Centre. Even if every penny could be referenced to performance-related criteria, the sums are staggering. Sane voices in the business world warn that the system is out of control. \u201cWe have to call a halt somewhere or you will be moving into the hundreds of millions before we know where we are and that will not be tolerated by wider society,\u201d said Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, after the BP vote. Fair comment. But here is why such warnings may not be heeded. First, we\u2019ve been here before. The ill-named \u201cshareholder spring,\u201d which led indirectly to Cable\u2019s reforms, happened in 2012. Several FTSE 100 firms\u2019 pay reports were voted down and, for a while, companies reined in their wilder ambitions. But the gravy train was far from derailed. It was more a case of a light touch being applied to the brakes until the fury died down. There is every chance the same will happen again. Second, the police officers on pay are, ultimately, still the highly paid fund managers, whose mood is heavily influenced by share prices. Would the revolt at BP have happened if the oil price, and thus the company\u2019s share price, had been higher? One doubts it. When the next bull market arrives, the pay accelerator will be hit again. Third, the BP vote \u2013 and that at Smith &amp; Nephew, the other defeated firm \u2013 was merely advisory. It was not a Cable-inspired three-yearly binding vote that would compel the board to do something. Both companies can ignore the protest and promise softly to listen harder next time. That\u2019s not the stuff of revolution. Instead, the furore over Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m may be remembered as remarkable at the time but, in the end, only a minor landmark. Real reform of a rotten system will only happen if shareholders have binding votes every year on actual pay awards, as opposed to outline pay policies, and if investors are then prepared to wield that power. We\u2019re still a very long way from there. A taxing dilemma Public support for higher taxes is low. Demands to save public services are growing. How to square the circle? Some suggest that increased efficiency will improve public services. While there are some gains to be made from radical reforms, the limits here are obvious as NHS trust deficits soar, teacher shortages grow and local authority spending cuts bite. So maybe there is a way to switch around how we pay tax and at the same time increase the amount collected? Let\u2019s say we scrap inheritance tax in favour of a tax on the beneficiaries. In that way, lottery-style gains on property would be taxed as a capital gain or as part of income. That could be both a reform and a tax-raising manoeuvre. Bringing back the 50p tax rate is another possibility. But the latest research suggests this kind of thinking is for the birds. Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn may want to impose higher taxes on the wealthy, but not many other people do. That is according to polls of attitudes across all developed countries \u2013 and why inheritance tax has already disappeared in Sweden, Canada and Australia. There are good reasons to tax property and land, especially as they cascade down the generations, entrenching privilege. The trouble here is that such wealth is quite widely spread compared with previous generations, even though the top 1% have maintained their lead on everyone else. Surveys pulled together by New York University politics professor David Stasavage and Stanford political scientist Kenneth Scheve in their new book, Taxing the Rich: A History of Fairness in the United States and Europe, show that gains on the stock market and soaring house prices are akin in most people\u2019s minds to lottery wins and considered a windfall. These are lucky breaks that might happen to me one day, people think, so there is no way they should be heavily taxed. That leaves only a consensus for ending tax avoidance. In this way hedge fund managers will at least pay the same tax rate as their cleaners. Given the rate at which tax is avoided, that is a big project in itself and could save lots of public services. What if China buys Port Talbot\u2019s steelworks? Now the real fight begins for the future of Port Talbot and Tata Steel\u2019s UK business. Tata and the government have officially started the sales process for the Indian company\u2019s UK sites, with financial advisers hired and information memorandums sent out to potential buyers. The mood among those close to the process is gloomy, with senior sources calling the prospect of finding a buyer for the whole business \u201cremote\u201d. After all the talk from Sajid Javid and the government about potentially \u201cco-investing\u201d with a buyer, this is when they must roll their sleeves up to try to actually attract that buyer. The fact that Tata Steel is getting Standard Chartered to trawl through the Asian steel market for a purchaser raises an interesting prospect. What if China \u2013 the country blamed for harming UK steel by dumping products \u2013 provides the potential saviour? Buying Tata Steel UK would certainly be one way for Beijing to get around the tariffs being imposed on its own steel.",
