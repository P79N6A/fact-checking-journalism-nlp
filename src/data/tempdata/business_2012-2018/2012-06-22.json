Their families in Mexico were threatened, according to one worker, while they were warned they faced deportation if they did not acquiesce to their employer's demands.</p> <p>The eight, with the support of the not-for-profit National Guestworker Alliance, <a href=\"http://www.guestworkeralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CJL_DOL-complaint.pdf\">lodged a complaint with the wage and hour division</a> of the department of labour this month, claiming that the company violated the fair labor standards act by failing to pay overtime and failed to keep accurate records as required by the act and by employers of workers on H2-B visas. </p> <p>The workers lodged a separate complaint with the occupational safety and health administration (OSHA), claiming the working conditions at CJ's flouted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.</p> <p>Separately the workers filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission \u2013 the first step in the process of bringing a discrimination lawsuit against an employer. </p> <p>The complaint <a href=\"http://www.guestworkeralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CJL_EEOC-complaint_6-6-12.pdf\">alleges that the eight were discriminated</a> against on the basis of race, color, national origin and retaliation, stating that Latino workers \"are forced to work longer and less desireable hours\" than other people of colour, and alleging that the workers were not paid \"according to the terms of their contract\".</p> <p>The department of labour confirmed two investigations, by the wage and hour division and the occupational safety and health administration, were ongoing. The EEOC is prohibited from discussing investigations by federal law.</p> <p>On Tuesday the eight workers delivered a petition with 130,000 signatures to the New York home of Walmart board member Michelle Burns, while they travelled to Washington DC on Wednesday to meet with members of the Senate appropriation committee.</p> <h2>'They locked the doors so we couldn't take breaks'</h2> <p>The workers are hoping to pressure Walmart into revoking their contract with CJ's Seafood as well as launch an investigation into standards at the plant.</p> <p>Ana Diaz, one of those on strike, said that a supervisor at the plant warned workers that they would not want him as an enemy.</p> <p>\"He said he had contacts with good people and bad people, and that they could find us no matter where we went,\" Diaz told the Guardian.</p> <p>Around 40 Mexicans are employed at CJ's Seafood, <a href=\"http://www.guestworkeralliance.org/2012/06/walmart-supply-chain-workers-hit-nyc-to-expose-forced-labor-cover-up/\">according to the alliance</a>, with the eight campaigners currently on strike against conditions.</p> <p>Diaz, who travelled to Louisiana from her home in Tamapaulipas, in north-east Mexico, said workers at the plant were involved in either peeling or cooking crawfish. Those peeling were mostly women, who worked from 2am until 5pm. Those cooking the fish tended to be men, who Diaz said were forced to work up to 24 hours at a time.</p> <p>\"On two occasions they locked the doors so we couldn't take breaks because they wanted us to produce the crawfish in a shorter time. He said that if we took breaks then he would lose a lot of money.\"</p> <p>\"We were afraid because he does know where many of us live. He knows where our family members live; he has our addresses and information.

      "bodyText": "Eight seafood plant workers are calling on Walmart to drop a supplier which they say forced them to work up to 24 hours a time and threatened their families with violence. The workers, who are all from Mexico, were employed to process crawfish by CJ's Seafood in Louisiana, under conditions which an independent report has described as \"rivalling any sweatshop in China or Bangladesh\". Separately, a group of warehouse workers have filed a complaint against Walmart and a PR firm associated with the supermarket giant, after a public relations officer was found to have posed as a student journalist to interview activists campaigning against working conditions in warehouses supplying big retailers. The CJ's Seafood workers say they were locked inside the crawfish processing plant during periods of peak demand. Their families in Mexico were threatened, according to one worker, while they were warned they faced deportation if they did not acquiesce to their employer's demands. The eight, with the support of the not-for-profit National Guestworker Alliance, lodged a complaint with the wage and hour division of the department of labour this month, claiming that the company violated the fair labor standards act by failing to pay overtime and failed to keep accurate records as required by the act and by employers of workers on H2-B visas. The workers lodged a separate complaint with the occupational safety and health administration (OSHA), claiming the working conditions at CJ's flouted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Separately the workers filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission \u2013 the first step in the process of bringing a discrimination lawsuit against an employer. The complaint alleges that the eight were discriminated against on the basis of race, color, national origin and retaliation, stating that Latino workers \"are forced to work longer and less desireable hours\" than other people of colour, and alleging that the workers were not paid \"according to the terms of their contract\". The department of labour confirmed two investigations, by the wage and hour division and the occupational safety and health administration, were ongoing. The EEOC is prohibited from discussing investigations by federal law. On Tuesday the eight workers delivered a petition with 130,000 signatures to the New York home of Walmart board member Michelle Burns, while they travelled to Washington DC on Wednesday to meet with members of the Senate appropriation committee. 'They locked the doors so we couldn't take breaks' The workers are hoping to pressure Walmart into revoking their contract with CJ's Seafood as well as launch an investigation into standards at the plant. Ana Diaz, one of those on strike, said that a supervisor at the plant warned workers that they would not want him as an enemy. \"He said he had contacts with good people and bad people, and that they could find us no matter where we went,\" Diaz told the Guardian. Around 40 Mexicans are employed at CJ's Seafood, according to the alliance, with the eight campaigners currently on strike against conditions. Diaz, who travelled to Louisiana from her home in Tamapaulipas, in north-east Mexico, said workers at the plant were involved in either peeling or cooking crawfish. Those peeling were mostly women, who worked from 2am until 5pm. Those cooking the fish tended to be men, who Diaz said were forced to work up to 24 hours at a time. \"On two occasions they locked the doors so we couldn't take breaks because they wanted us to produce the crawfish in a shorter time. He said that if we took breaks then he would lose a lot of money.\" \"We were afraid because he does know where many of us live. He knows where our family members live; he has our addresses and information. That's when we felt the most locked in and the most abused.\" Neither Walmart nor CJ's Seafood responded to requests for comment, although Walmart spokeswoman Megan Murphy told the Daily Beast: \"Following our investigation, as well as investigations by the department of labour and OSHA, at this time we are unable to substantiate claims of forced labour or human trafficking at CJ Seafood.\" Given the investigations by the department of labour began less than three weeks ago, however, it is likely to be some time before they conclude. A spokesman would not comment on the status of the probes, except to say they were still ongoing. An independent investigation by the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), originally set up by university administrators, students and labour rights campaigners to prevent sweatshops being used to manufacture university clothing but which now also conducts investigations into broader working conditions, found that \"the totality of the abuses taking place at this employer constitute forced labour under US law\". \"The conditions at this Walmart supplier are among the worst we have encountered, rivaling any sweatshop in China or Bangladesh,\" said WRC's executive director Scott Nova. Jacob Horwitz, lead organiser, said the system of bringing temporary workers into the US \"really amounts to creating a whole class of workers without access to the same rights as workers who are [already] in the country\". Some 130,000 people have signed a petition supporting Diaz and her colleagues on Change.org calling on Walmart to sign an agreement to guarantee civil and labour rights for guestworkers in the US, which Diaz and others delivered to Burns's address in lower Manhattan on Tuesday. It has been a difficult week for the supermarket giant. Last Thursday a public relations officer working for a firm contracted by Walmart was revealed to have posed as a student journalist to interview a labor group highlighting tough working conditions in warehouses that supply by big retailers. Stephanie Harnett, a publicist for Mercury Communications, interviewed an activist from Warehouse Workers United (WWU) under the assumed name \"Zoe Mitchell\". On Wednesday WWU filed complaints against both Walmart and Mercury Communications for what it called \"illegally spying on workers\". \"Warehouse workers risk retaliation every time we speak to the media and to learn that the company was hiding behind a fake reporter makes me really mad,\" said Santos Castaneda, the worker interviewed by Harnett. The complaint was filed with the regional office of the national labor relations board, which prohibits spying on workers, WWU said.",

Markets react remarkably quickly these days to economic news and can offset a positive move by the central bank within minutes. A lower currency brings higher import prices and inflation. Further down the line, any sign of growth pushes up commodity prices and leads to even higher inflation. Jonathan Portes, the head of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR), says he sympathises with Weale, but believes the deflationary pressures to be so great that he would pull all the levers available. That means more QE, looser rules for bank capital and a carefully crafted, but significant fiscal boost. And soon. It's not easy, given the countervailing forces. But the UK should be arguing for it, and in a concerted fashion with European partners and the US. Maybe it will need to wait till next year when Merkel is history and Obama is re-elected.",

The Accountancy and Actuarial Discipline Board (AADB) has concluded that no action should be taken against E&amp;Y or any individuals in connection with the auditing of the Wall Street firm before it collapsed in September 2008. The disciplinary body, which is part of the Financial Reporting Council, started its investigation in June 2010 after allegations were made in the US bankruptcy court about accounting practices that had allowed Lehman to make its London business look smaller than it was really was.

      "bodyText": "Heritage Oil has endured a stinging rebellion against its pay policy with nearly half of shareholders failing to support the remuneration report \u2013 despite the chief executive, former mercenary Tony Buckingham, controlling 33% of the shares. The FTSE 250 exploration and production business which is active in Kurdistan, Africa and Russia, got the agreement of holders of 140m shares to the pay arrangements but holders of nearly 27m voted against and holders of a further 90m shares either abstained or did not vote. That gave Buckingham more than 80% of the votes cast. Other resolutions such as one which gave directors authority to \"allot shares\" were also subject to significant shareholder rebellions with over 30% of those who participated voting against. Heritage declined to comment after the meeting, held at the offices of its lawyers on Jersey, where it is registered, but sources said the board was unlikely to be influenced by the opposition. Ahead of the meeting the company attracted heavy criticism from shareholder bodies such as the Association of British Insurers which issued a \"red-top\" alert in objection to the two-year notice period for its executive directors. Investors prefer directors to have 12-month contracts. Pensions Investment Research Consultants (Pirc), another shareholder adviser, urged investors to oppose Heritage's remuneration report, criticising the notice periods and Buckingham's \u00a31.36m pay package, which included an annual bonus of \u00a3531,600. Pirc said before the annual meeting that directors' bonuses were \"astonishing\" for a year in which the company racked up losses of $66.9m (\u00a344m), lost over two thirds of its share price in 18 months, and was in dispute with the Ugandan Revenue Authority and Tullow Oil over approximately $400m of tax liabilities. Heritage Oil has previously acknowledged that the policy, which applies to Buckingham and chief financial officer, Paul Atherton, defies the London Stock Exchange's best practice recommendations. But it said the notice periods were put in place contractually before the company listed on the stock exchange in 2008 and people were wrong to judge oil explorers in the way they did other businesses such as insurance. The Heritage rebellion is just the latest in a series which have swept through Britain's leading companies in what has become known as the \"shareholder spring\".",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Spain to make bank bailout request by Monday", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Spain will this weekend finally formally request the bailout money it needs to prop up ailing banks as frustration grows about foot-dragging by prime minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative government. Finance minister Luis de Guindos, who on Thursday pledged to make the request immediately, has now told the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers they will have it by Monday. The Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker had already stated that the group expected to have the request, which de Guindos had described as \"a mere formality\", in its hands on Monday. Juncker said eurozone ministers had tried to hurry Spain up, inviting it to \"pursue [a] clear and ambitious strategy, which needs to be implemented swiftly and communicated early.\" Spain will base its request on two independent valuations of its banks which suggest the sector needs up to \u20ac62bn (\u00a349bn) to see it through the next three years if the economy takes an even sharper turn for the worse. Spain has been offered up to \u20ac100bn in help for its banks alone. It was not clear whether the weekend's petition would include an exact sum of money. The latest delay follows Spain's slowness to recognise the hole caused by toxic real estate in some of its banks after a property bubble burst four years ago. It also reflects Rajoy's refusal to call the loans being offered to Spain a \"bailout\", even though the money will be loaned to the state, then passed on to the banks. Madrid now hopes that a growing clamour for future rescues of Europe's banks to be done directly, without money going via governments, may still allow it to avoid accepting loans that would add to an already fast-growing national debt. De Guindos said on Friday that this option may still be open to Spain, especially as the banks would not need the money immediately. \"I think (direct bank recapitalisation) is a possibility,\" he told reporters. \"It is one of the fundamental elements to break the link between bank risk and sovereign risk.\" \"This possibility is absolutely open to Spain if there is progress in the next few months, \" he added. \"The process of recapitalisation is not instantaneous.\" Spain has recently decided to stretch out the bailout process further, with full information on the amounts needed by individual banks not available until September. Four auditing firms will now carry out more exhaustive audits of each of Spain's banks by 31 July. A round of stress tests will then be held on each entity in September. Banks then seen to be financially unsound will be given 15 days to come up with restructuring plans and, if approved, nine months to fulfil them. The temporary EFSF bailout fund will initially provide the money to Spain, with the permanent ESM fund taking over later. Full details of the terms and conditions will have to wait until the next Eurogroup meeting on 9 July. Analysts see Spain's economy shrinking by 1.7% this year and by a further 0.6% in 2013, according to a study by the Funcas think-tank that looked at 18 different analysts' reports. They said a better than expected start to the year, with a 0.3% shrinkage in the first quarter, would be followed by a sharper dip in the second half of the year. Unemployment in Spain remains at 24%, with more than half of the under-25s out of work. Markets reacted calmly on Friday to the downgrade by Moody's of 16 European and US banks, with share prices steady after the reduction in credit ratings, which can push up the cost of borrowing for banks which they could pass on to customers. Even Credit Suisse, with its three-notch downgrade, shrugged off the rating cuts, which followed a four month review of ratings across Europe. HSBC was downgraded just one notch \u2013 but still grouped among the strongest banks \u2013 as was Royal Bank of Scotland which criticised the one notch cut to its rating. Analysts at UBS said that a cut to a short-term rating for RBS might shut the bank out of the US money markets. Data from ratings agency Fitch showed that these funds were still refusing to provide short-term funds to eurozone banks \u2013 the same situation that sparked concerns about French banks last year.",

Full details of the terms and conditions will have to wait until the next Eurogroup meeting on 9 July.</p> <p>Analysts see Spain's economy shrinking by 1.7% this year and by a further 0.6% in 2013, according to a study by the Funcas think-tank that looked at 18 different analysts' reports.</p> <p>They said a better than expected start to the year, with a 0.3% shrinkage in the first quarter, would be followed by a sharper dip in the second half of the year.</p> <p>Unemployment in Spain remains at 24%, with more than half of the under-25s out of work.</p> <p>Markets reacted calmly on Friday to the downgrade by Moody's of 16 European and US banks, with share prices steady after the reduction in credit ratings, which can push up the cost of borrowing for banks which they could pass on to customers. Even Credit Suisse, with its three-notch downgrade, shrugged off the rating cuts, which followed a four month review of ratings across Europe.</p> <p>HSBC was downgraded just one notch \u2013 but still grouped among the strongest banks \u2013 as was Royal Bank of Scotland which criticised the one notch cut to its rating.</p> <p>Analysts at UBS said that a cut to a short-term rating for RBS might shut the bank out of the US money markets. Data from ratings agency Fitch showed that these funds were still refusing to provide short-term funds to eurozone banks \u2013 the same situation that sparked concerns about French banks last year.</p>",

Max Petroleum is down 50%, (dropping 4.5p to 4.2p) after it warned its well in Kazakhstan has hit a snag. Bosses will be hoping a third-time-lucky approach will solve its problems, revealing its drill has become stuck 5,722 metres into the ground. It had been making slow progress, as it tried to avoid the first drill which got stuck back in April at 5,681 metres in the Kungarian Salt. But the scientists have a solution, and in the company's words: \"operations are now ongoing to increase the mud density further, free the stuck pipe by dissolving the salt with fresh water\". More seriously for the company, it seems to be running out of cash and has started discussions with lenders, having burned through $54.2m of its total borrowing capacity of $58m. The company said it will struggle because of new rules in Kazakhstan which prevents the business doing any debt-for-equity swaps. Total costs for the NUR-1 well, which was supposed to complete in April, before being pushed back to August, will be $43m, and the latest announcement makes no estimate for completion.",
