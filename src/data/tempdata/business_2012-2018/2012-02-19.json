The revelation came as the foreign secretary, William Hague, became the first senior cabinet minister to condemn the practice of setting up companies through which to siphon salaries. The Guardian revealed last week that as many as 25 full-time NHS staff, most on contracts as long as five years, are paid through companies owned by their families.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There's a scene in The Lord of the Rings where the wizard Gandalf confronts the Balrog, a hellish monster, on a narrow bridge in the Mines of Moria. The battle ends with Gandalf smiting the bridge with his staff, sending the Balrog plunging into a fathomless abyss. There's a twist to the tail, however. As the monster falls, one last swish of its whip curls round Gandalf's ankle and drags him down into the pit as well. Views may differ, in the context of the eurozone debt crisis, whether Greece is Gandalf or the Balrog, but one thing is for certain; the risks of mutually assured destruction are high. Both Greece and the hardline European countries demanding cast-iron assurances that they are not throwing good money after bad in a new \u20ac130bn (\u00a3108bn) bailout have the potential to shatter what, at best, is a fragile truce. The Greeks might decide they have had a bellyful, and that default and departure from the euro is preferable to endless austerity and the humiliation of colonial status. The Germans, Austrians, Dutch and Finns could come to the conclusion that Greece is a lost cause, and that nothing politicians in Athens say about their commitment to collecting taxes, cutting spending and reforming the economy can be believed. They might decide, despite all the official statements to the contrary, to chuck Greece out of the single currency. Although the creditors appear to hold all the trump cards, that is not really the case. Greek politicians can put their signatures to little pieces of paper pledging themselves to stick to the terms of a bailout deal, but once the money has been delivered and elections held, the incoming government could tell the other members of the single currency to take a running jump. Sovereign states \u2013 even those as vulnerable as Greece \u2013 always have that power. What's more, the Greeks have the advantage of knowing that a financial crisis precipitated by a messy default would hurt the rest of Europe more than it would hurt them. In Like a Rolling Stone, Bob Dylan sings: \"When you've got nothing you've got nothing to lose\" \u2013 that's a sentiment that resonates with many Greeks. Dhaval Joshi, of BCA Research, makes an interesting point in this context. There are, he says, traditionally two ways of getting rid of your debts: you can grind them down, little by little, through protracted austerity programmes. Alternatively, you can default, which gets rid of the debt quickly but leads to a much sharper plunge in output. But for Greece, there is scant difference between the two: it will have a deep v-shaped recession if it defaults but it is having a deep v-shaped recession anyway. And there is not one politician in Athens who believes that sucking a further \u20ac3.3bn out of an economy contracting at an annual rate of 7% will do anything other than intensify the slump. Black hole Those holding the purse strings are doing their own cost-benefit analysis. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany's finance minister, summed up the mood when he talked of pouring money down a black hole. If, as the northern European eurozone members clearly believe, Greece will be back for another bailout in the near future, why risk the wrath of their voters by handing over \u20ac130bn now? The assumption is that the European Central Bank has created a firewall by throwing cheap money at commercial banks, and that there would be no repeat of what happened following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. This is a very big assumption. The Bank of England certainly does not believe that Greece could be quarantined in the event of a messy default. Nor does Barack Obama, who talks to Angela Merkel at least once a week about the crisis. Nor, in all probability, does the ECB itself, because it appreciates the fragility of many European banks, including some of the biggest names. It is not enough to know that bank X has a certain quantity of Greek debt on its books, nor even how many credit default swaps it is holding. As Joshi notes, there is also \"a large, active market in derivatives of CDS and even derivatives of derivatives. And as these more complex and esoteric instruments are over-the-counter contracts with no central clearing or reconciliation, it is simply not possible to know who holds what gross or net exposure, where they are, and what chain reactions would ensue.\" What conclusions can we draw from all this? Firstly, that the laidback approach of the financial markets to Greece looks worryingly complacent. The hardening of the rhetoric last week is possibly more than just sabre-rattling; there was talk last week that Monday's summit will merely provide Greece with a bridging loan to tide it over for the next few weeks. This crisis is approaching its end game, and the chances of events spiralling out of control is much higher than the market bulls imagine. Secondly, the insults being hurled by both sides hardly foster confidence that the eurozone can survive this crisis in one piece. What we have seen in recent weeks is a growing alienation of voters across Europe from the idea of closer fiscal union, even though closer fiscal union is the only way that the fundamental flaws in monetary union can hope to be remedied. For the Greeks, fiscal union means being bossed around by the Germans; for the Germans it means writing blank cheques to the Greeks. This is not a healthy state of affairs. Disintegration Finally, the overt lack of anything that could be remotely described as European solidarity illustrates the unworkability of the \"project\" and hints at its eventual disintegration. Put simply, monetary union created a common interest rate at a time when inflation levels varied markedly. Some countries \u2013 mainly the northern European ones \u2013 had inflation rates lower than the level of interest rates, so they tended to grow more slowly and have higher levels of saving. Other countries \u2013 mainly those on the southern periphery \u2013 had negative real interest rates because loan costs were below the inflation rate. They grew quickly and had an incentive to borrow from the savers of northern Europe. There are only two ways this can end. The weaker countries leave the single currency and run independent monetary policies tailored to their circumstances. Alternatively, they agree to do what Germany and the other northern European countries tell them, in return for substantial fiscal transfers. As things stand, the former looks much more likely. Those who know their Tolkien will recall that Gandalf finally defeats the Balrog but perishes in the process. He is then reincarnated in a new form. The same fate may await the euro. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2012. The original said that some northern countries \"had inflation rates lower than the level of inflation\". That was meant to be . . . lower than the level of interest rates.",

The Bank of England certainly does not believe that Greece could be quarantined in the event of a messy default. Nor does Barack Obama, who talks to Angela Merkel at least once a week about the crisis. Nor, in all probability, does the ECB itself, because it appreciates the fragility of many European banks, including some of the biggest names.</p> <p>It is not enough to know that bank X has a certain quantity of Greek debt on its books, nor even how many credit default swaps it is holding. As Joshi notes, there is also \"a large, active market in derivatives of CDS and even derivatives of derivatives. And as these more complex and esoteric instruments are over-the-counter contracts with no central clearing or reconciliation, it is simply not possible to know who holds what gross or net exposure, where they are, and what chain reactions would ensue.\"</p> <p>What conclusions can we draw from all this? Firstly, that the laidback approach of the financial markets to Greece looks worryingly complacent. The hardening of the rhetoric last week is possibly more than just sabre-rattling; there was talk last week that Monday's summit will merely provide Greece with a bridging loan to tide it over for the next few weeks. This crisis is approaching its end game, and the chances of events spiralling out of control is much higher than the market bulls imagine.</p> <p>Secondly, the insults being hurled by both sides hardly foster confidence that the eurozone can survive this crisis in one piece. What we have seen in recent weeks is a growing alienation of voters across Europe from the idea of closer fiscal union, even though closer fiscal union is the only way that the fundamental flaws in monetary union can hope to be remedied. For the Greeks, fiscal union means being bossed around by the Germans; for the Germans it means writing blank cheques to the Greeks. This is not a healthy state of affairs.</p> <p><strong>Disintegration</strong></p> <p>Finally, the overt lack of anything that could be remotely described as European solidarity illustrates the unworkability of the \"project\" and hints at its eventual disintegration. Put simply, monetary union created a common interest rate at a time when inflation levels varied markedly. Some countries \u2013 mainly the northern European ones \u2013 had inflation rates lower than the level of interest rates, so they tended to grow more slowly and have higher levels of saving. Other countries \u2013 mainly those on the southern periphery \u2013 had negative real interest rates because loan costs were below the inflation rate. They grew quickly and had an incentive to borrow from the savers of northern Europe.</p> <p>There are only two ways this can end. The weaker countries leave the single currency and run independent monetary policies tailored to their circumstances. Alternatively, they agree to do what Germany and the other northern European countries tell them, in return for substantial fiscal transfers. As things stand, the former looks much more likely.</p> <p>Those who know their Tolkien will recall that Gandalf finally defeats the Balrog but perishes in the process. He is then reincarnated in a new form. The same fate may await the euro.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2012. The original said that some northern countries \"had inflation rates lower than the level of inflation\". That was meant to be . . . lower than the level of interest rates.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The clean-up bill for Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group has already topped \u00a390bn, put nearly 80,000 jobs on the line, and left taxpayers nursing a \u00a332bn loss on their stakes in the bailed-out banks. But when they report their results for 2011 this week, both are likely to concede that their salvage operations are not yet complete, despite three years of downsizing and reshaping. Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, admitted recently that when he took on the job he had expected 2012 to be the year that the government could herald a sell-off of the bank's shares. Yet, with the economy, the ongoing crisis in the eurozone and a series of regulatory changes \u2013 including the ring-fencing proposals from the Vickers commission on banking \u2013 all combining to weigh down on bank share prices, analysts reckon that the government will be stuck with an 82% stake in RBS and a 41% stake in Lloyds for some time yet. Robert Talbut, chief investment officer of Royal London Asset Management, says: \"It is very clear to everyone that the government are going to hold these stakes for much longer than anybody anticipated. The prospect of the government being able to sell down their stakes in the next three years is extremely slim. That is due to regulatory change both in the UK and globally. It is also due to the interrelation between the growth rates in the UK economy and what that means for asset values on a lot of the assets that they have on their balance sheets.\" Despite the costs of cleaning up \u2013 \u00a338bn at RBS and \u00a354bn at Lloyds \u2013 an array of bonus payouts is on the cards, particularly at RBS, which on Thursday will unveil the size of its bonus pool for 2011 when it publishes full-year results. A figure of about \u00a3500m is expected for the bonus payouts, about half of last year's total. While Hester has waived his bonus, he will receive other payments this year while several of his close lieutenants stand to share as much as \u00a311m when share awards dating back as far as 2009 pay out in the next few months. Lloyds, which a year ago heralded a return to profitability after the controversial takeover of HBOS, will plunge back into loss after making the \u00a33.2bn provision for payment protection insurance that new chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio demanded weeks after taking the helm in March. The three-year integration of HBOS should now be complete; it has cost 30,000 jobs with another 15,000 sanctioned over the next few years by Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who returned to work in January following two months off caused by fatigue. Analysts at Nomura say: \"We believe the two groups will continue to see downgrades to results in both their core operations and in the costs of exiting non-core [businesses].\" Even after a rally in their shares \u2013 RBS stood at 27p and Lloyds at 35p on Friday \u2013 they are still stuck below the average prices of 50.2p and 73.6p at which the taxpayer bought in during the bailouts that began in October 2008. The Nomura analysts reckon this is not a time to be drawn in. \"We regard the current sector rally as a selling opportunity in what are likely to be drawn-out recovery projects in both cases,\" they say. But it is a chance for City and private investors to sell, if not the government \u2013 unless the Treasury is prepared to stomach the first tranches of shares being sold at such a huge loss. When Sir David Cooksey retired in January as chairman of UK Financial Investments \u2013 which Labour set up to control the taxpayer stakes in the bailed-out banks \u2013 he admitted: \"Disposals of the investments in Lloyds and RBS will inevitably take longer than originally expected, given the challenging economic and banking industry environments both in the UK and globally.\" The Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg suggested last year that one way to tackle the problem might be to give away the shares to the 45 million people on the electoral roll. While the Treasury might be stuck with the shares for longer than expected, there are obvious signs of progress. Lloyds had weaned itself off the Bank of England's special liquidity scheme by the time it ran out in January after it kept the bank afloat during the deepest days of the banking crisis. It is also trying to sell to the Co-op 632 of its branches that the EU has demanded be divested under European rules governing state aid, although for some analysts the progress is slow. The losses on bad loans made by HBOS, which Lloyds rescued in 2008, appear to have peaked. RBS, meanwhile, has reduced its balance sheet to \u00a31.4 trillion \u2013 still the size of the UK economy but considerably smaller than the \u00a32.2tn that the taxpayer faced bailing out during the crisis. Hester is pulling out of the loss-making parts of investment banking while the flotation of RBS's insurance arm \u2014 which includes Direct Line, Churchill, Privilege and Green Flag and must be sold to satisfy EU state-aid rules by the end of 2014 \u2013 is getting closer: the outfit, formerly RBS Insurance, adopted the Direct Line name last week in what was regarded as a step towards the exit. If the government is to hold on to its bank stakes for longer than expected, the opportunity should be seized, according to Gavin Hayes of left-leaning thinktank Compass. \"The government should be taking a much more interventionist approach, both in terms of lending to [small businesses] and continuing to intervene in terms of executive remuneration at the banks, \" Hayes says. Lending to businesses is a big issue for the coalition: the rate at which corporate loans were repaid in 2011 outpaced the speed at which new ones were granted despite the \"Project Merlin\" lending targets agreed with the government. A contraction in lending is a worrying sign for any government hoping to foster economic growth; the economy shrank by 0.2% in the fourth quarter (although that figure will be updated this week). Tony Greenham, head of finance and business at the New Economics Foundation, reckons the existence of the targets at all is a \"sign of failure\". \"A functioning banking system should not require government to intervene so that businesses have access to credit,\" he says. Others, such as Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, argue that lending targets should be imposed. He says: \"There's no realistic prospect of selling these stakes in the next few years. We must now set net business lending targets for the nationalised banks, as set out in our coalition agreement. We've poured in \u00a33,000 for every single taxpayer \u2013 so they've a democratic duty to lend.\"",

But new research shows that the economic gloom has failed to permeate the higher echelons of the retail sector, with premium brand sales rocketing as upmarket supermarkets' fine dining lines defy the downturn. The research also suggests that the retail sector, especially food and drink, is becoming polarised, with budget brands also performing well. Kantar Worldpanel, which tracks consumer behaviour through 30,000 UK households, says a sharp divergence in consumption patterns is taking place. In the past 12 months, strong sales at Aldi and Lidl, which are known for their discount brands, and the success of Waitrose suggest that both the bottom and top ends of the market are outperforming the centre. \"The recession may have led us to believe that we are all in it together, but the high street tells a different story,\" said Edward Garner, director at Kantar Worldpanel. \"Two nations of shoppers have emerged within the grocery market.We only have to look at the strong performances of hard discounters Aldi and Lidl, who have seen a 9% year-on-year increase while, at the other end of the price scale, Waitrose has achieved growth of 8%.\" The combined growth rate of Aldi, Lidl and Waitrose last year was almost triple that of the big four supermarkets, suggesting shoppers are moving away from the middle ground.

    "webTitle": "Poland surveys the eurozone turmoil: eager to join, but perhaps not yet", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The cliched western view of Poland \u2013 bogged down by communist inefficiency and rusting tractors \u2013 is long gone. This was the only EU economy to avoid contraction in the dark days of 2009, leading the prime minister to describe Polish economic growth (albeit at a modest 1.6%) as a \"green island\" amid the red sea of recession elsewhere in the union. Demand at home cushioned the economy when exports declined, and this has helped Poles feel they would succeed in weathering the global crisis where others had so patently failed. But attitudes towards joining the euro, once seen as the badge of a successful economy, are changing as the turmoil in Europe continues. The Polish economy is still growing. There has been massive public investment due to the European football championship that Poland is co-hosting this year, made possible by the vast amount of funding the country gets from Brussels. And the weakening zloty, which suffered last year when traders became increasingly nervous about the worsening debt situation in Greece and other eurozone members, has helped to keep exports ticking over. Whether this trend can continue obviously depends a great deal on the ongoing attempts to sew up the hole in Greece's leaky wallet. Most important from Poland's point of view, though, is not whether Greece defaults on its debt or is forced to leave the eurozone, but what effect the whole mess will have on Germany. More than a quarter of Poland's exports go to its western neighbour, and the two countries are woven together on myriad levels. There are plenty of diehard anti-Germans in Poland, but even more who own small businesses and who know that Poland's economic wellbeing is to a great extent dependent on that of Europe's largest economy \u2013 and by extension, of the eurozone as a whole. As Radek Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, said in a recent speech in Berlin, the biggest danger for Poland today is \"not terrorism, it's not the Taliban, and it's certainly not German tanks. It's not even Russian missiles which President Medvedev has just threatened to deploy on the EU's border. The biggest threat to the security and prosperity of Poland would be the collapse of the eurozone.\" Domestic economic policy also plays a role, of course. Here opinions are split into two fiercely opposed camps: those in the government who say Poland is on track for economic nirvana, and those predicting Armageddon. Krzysztof Rybinski, a former deputy governor of the central bank and one of the government's sharpest critics, has said that 2011 was the last good year for the Polish economy and that things will go downhill from the second half of 2012, for want of decent reforms in the face of an economic slowdown, an ageing population and a looming energy crisis. People should prepare for lean years ahead, he believes. Poles either seem to be listening to detractors like Rybinski, or not have much respect for the opinions of their political leaders (a phenomenon that has a long history in Poland), or have been watching the riots in Athens and Madrid on TV. A recent study by Polish polling organisation CBOS showed that 81% of Poles think the euro crisis is likely to threaten them and their families personally, which is perhaps not surprising, considering the fact that unemployment is high. Agricultural workers are particularly nervous because the prime minister has pledged to bring their social security and pensions scheme into line with the national system, thus cutting their already very modest benefits. And popular support for adopting the euro is lower than ever, with another CBOS poll finding that 60% of Poles are opposed to the idea. Poland, like its fellow post-communist neighbours, agreed in its EU accession treaty to adopt the euro once it meets the conditions for doing so (Britain and Denmark are the only EU states to have an official opt-out clause). There is no deadline for adoption, though, and since the Polish government was forced to drop its previous target of 2011 after the prime minister announced it, with spectacularly bad timing, just days before the Lehman Brothers collapse, it has not set a new date. Now, of course, that seems not to be a sign of laziness in meeting the adoption criteria, but eminently sensible. The finance minister says primly whenever asked that Poland does want to be in the eurozone, but that it must first put its house in order. The truth is, in fact, that Poland is nowhere near to meeting the conditions for adoption, with its budget deficit way above the 3%-of-GDP limit and inflation too high, not to mention the volatility of its currency. Is the Polish government unhappy about the fact that it cannot currently be pressurised into adopting the euro? Possibly not. Nonetheless, Poland is very keen to have a say in the future of the euro area. During its presidency of the EU, in the second half of 2011, it was miffed not to have been invited to the Eurogroup meetings of finance ministers, and it fell out with France over the recently signed fiscal compact, which Warsaw said should include prospective euro members in eurozone summits. Prime minister Donald Tusk was forced to back down, although officials insist that a compromise solution means that Poland will be invited to attend some 90% of the meetings at which the eurozone's future will be decided. Some of Poland's euro breast-beating may be a ploy to distance itself from Hungary, its fellow ex-communist state whose populist government has got itself into trouble with the EU for supposedly meddling with the independence of its central bank. However, maybe Poland's coy stance on the question of euro adoption is down to character. The almost Scandinavian seriousness with which the prime minister addressed EU audiences last year certainly impressed the western Eurocrats, and fostered the growing belief that the split in the EU is now no longer between a backward east and developed west but between a thrifty north and a profligate south. The view from Poland, despite popular fears and the prospective hardship to be caused by the government's fiscal reforms, is still pretty rosy. Perhaps the eurozone should take a leaf out of Poland's book \u2013 if it's not too late.",

      "body": "<p>The cliched western view of Poland \u2013 bogged down by communist inefficiency and rusting tractors \u2013 is long gone. This was the only EU economy to avoid contraction in the dark days of 2009, leading the prime minister to describe Polish economic growth (albeit at a modest 1.6%) as a \"green island\" amid the red sea of recession elsewhere in the union.</p> <p>Demand at home cushioned the economy when exports declined, and this has helped Poles feel they would succeed in weathering the global crisis where others had so patently failed. But attitudes towards joining the euro, once seen as the badge of a successful economy, are changing as the turmoil in Europe continues.</p> <p>The Polish economy is still growing. There has been massive public investment due to the European football championship that Poland is co-hosting this year, made possible by the vast amount of funding the country gets from Brussels. And the weakening zloty, which suffered last year when traders became increasingly nervous about the worsening debt situation in Greece and other eurozone members, has helped to keep exports ticking over.</p> <p>Whether this trend can continue obviously depends a great deal on the ongoing attempts to sew up the hole in Greece's leaky wallet. Most important from Poland's point of view, though, is not whether Greece defaults on its debt or is forced to leave the eurozone, but what effect the whole mess will have on Germany.</p> <p>More than a quarter of Poland's exports go to its western neighbour, and the two countries are woven together on myriad levels. There are plenty of diehard anti-Germans in Poland, but even more who own small businesses and who know that Poland's economic wellbeing is to a great extent dependent on that of Europe's largest economy \u2013 and by extension, of the eurozone as a whole.</p> <p>As Radek Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, said in a recent speech in Berlin, the biggest danger for Poland today is \"not terrorism, it's not the Taliban, and it's certainly not German tanks. It's not even Russian missiles which President Medvedev has just threatened to deploy on the EU's border. The biggest threat to the security and prosperity of Poland would be the collapse of the eurozone.\"</p> <p>Domestic economic policy also plays a role, of course.

      "bodyText": "Despite Moody's unwelcome warning that the UK faces a one in three risk of losing its cherished AAA rating, last week's economic news \u2013 inflation down to 3.6%, unemployment rising less rapidly than at any time since last summer \u2013 came as a considerable relief to the UK's policymakers, who had begun to fear the eurozone would drag us into a deep recession. Recent business surveys have painted a marginally less dire picture than those in the autumn that suggested activity might be \"falling off a cliff\" in a way scarily reminiscent of the post-Lehman shakeout. But even if the drama unfolding in Athens has a happy ending \u2013 which it won't \u2013 the UK is in the early stages of a prolonged adjustment to living within its means. Analysis by consultancy McKinsey suggested that while US households have made some progress towards tackling the legacy of debt left by the boom years \u2013 partly through painful repossessions, which result in their mortgages being written down \u2013 in the UK we have barely begun. That's not surprising: in an era of public sector austerity, it's all but impossible for many families to work on repairing their own finances. But it does mean that even once confidence returns, and more families recover what David Cameron has called Britain's \"can-do optimism\" \u2013 and, more importantly, real take-home pay finally starts to rise again as inflation eases \u2013 the clouds won't part to reveal a sunny economic future. Without the cut-price credit and spiralling house prices that helped to sustain consumption in the early noughties, many households will scale down their aspirations, and concentrate on paying off their mortgages instead of hitting the shops. Some analysts \u2013 including the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club \u2013 have highlighted the healthy state of corporate balance sheets as promising a rapid recovery if \"animal spirits\" revive; but, as the British Retail Consortium warned on Friday, many companies are facing the choice of whether to spend those cash balances at home, where demand is on the floor, or expand abroad instead. Meanwhile, the human costs of the stalled recovery are immense. The detail of the labour market figures included the profoundly depressing news that 860,000 people have now been unemployed for more than a year. More than 300,000 claimed jobseeker's allowance \u2013 meant to be a temporary benefit \u2013 throughout 2011. More women are unemployed than at any time for a quarter of a century (and remember, the total includes only those looking for work, not those who have given up altogether), and more than a million young people are stuck on the shelf. The government has been careful not to release any data about the performance of its Work Programme, which is meant to give private sector firms the incentive to tackle tricky cases \u2013 drug-users, single mums who haven't worked for years, long-term sickness-benefit claimants who have now been declared fit for work. But the National Audit Office warned recently that the success rate of the scheme was likely to be far lower than the government assumes; and anecdotal evidence is of clients being \"parked\" on cut-price training courses, or coaxed into unpaid work experience, while the outsourcing firms pocket the payments for having them on their books. As George Osborne draws up his budget over the next month, he will need to tread extremely carefully to avoid alarming the gilts market, given his commitment to austerity. But he must also be aware that a prolonged period of slow or non-existent growth will undermine tax revenues and make his programme self-defeating. No amount of tough talk will stop investors eventually losing hope if growth fails to return \u2013 and that could unleash a damaging spiral of rising gilt yields, fresh austerity measures and rising interest rates. Osborne has already had to extend his planned spending cuts beyond the next election, to avoid missing his target for balancing the budget after the economy underperformed in 2011. Given the political mood and the markets' views, he can't chuck austerity out; but he could take some targeted measures, using cash raised elsewhere. If he does, the unemployed should be his first target. The Lib Dems' cherished aim of progressively raising the personal tax threshold towards \u00a310,000 is laudable, but, like the Work Programme, it was dreamt up in better times. Giving a tiny fillip to a very large number of people \u2013 many of them earning well above the average wage \u2013 is a luxury the government cannot afford. Many of the poorest in the population already pay no tax because they earn too little or nothing at all. Whether it's through cuts in national insurance for firms hiring the long-term unemployed, or a new targeted scheme along the lines of Nick Clegg's Youth Contract (which echoes Labour's Future Jobs Fund, shut down by the coalition), the 860,000 people who couldn't find a day's work in 2011 urgently need help if they are not to become dependent on costly handouts for many years to come. Judging by the noises emerging from Downing Street, the Tories are keen to use Moody's warning as a reason to brush off Clegg's demands to raise the personal allowance. They are right to do so, but that would not preclude raising new funds to pay for more targeted emergency measures from those who can best afford it. Levying a supertax on this year's bonus round, as Labour has suggested, would be a good place to start.",

      "body": "<p>Despite Moody's unwelcome warning that the UK faces<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/14/ratings-agencies-financial-sector\" title=\"\"> a one in three risk of losing its cherished AAA rating</a>, last week's economic news \u2013 inflation down to 3.6%, unemployment rising less rapidly than at any time since last summer \u2013 came as a considerable relief to the UK's policymakers, who had begun to fear the eurozone would drag us into a deep recession.</p> <p>Recent business surveys have painted a marginally less dire picture than those in the autumn that suggested activity might be \"falling off a cliff\" in a way scarily reminiscent of the post-Lehman shakeout. But even if the drama unfolding in Athens has a happy ending \u2013 which it won't \u2013 the UK is in the early stages of a prolonged adjustment to living within its means.</p> <p>Analysis by consultancy McKinsey suggested that while US households have made some progress towards tackling the legacy of debt left by the boom years \u2013 partly through painful repossessions, which result in their mortgages being written down \u2013 in the UK we have barely begun.</p> <p>That's not surprising: in an era of public sector austerity, it's all but impossible for many families to work on repairing their own finances.</p> <p>But it does mean that even once confidence returns, and more families recover what David Cameron has called Britain's \"can-do optimism\" \u2013 and, more importantly, real take-home pay finally starts to rise again as inflation eases \u2013 the clouds won't part to reveal a sunny economic future.</p> <p>Without the cut-price credit and spiralling house prices that helped to sustain consumption in the early noughties, many households will scale down their aspirations, and concentrate on paying off their mortgages instead of hitting the shops.</p> <p>Some analysts \u2013 including the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club \u2013 have highlighted the healthy state of corporate balance sheets as promising a rapid recovery if \"animal spirits\" revive; but, as the British Retail Consortium warned on Friday, many companies are facing the choice of whether to spend those cash balances at home, where demand is on the floor, or expand abroad instead.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the human costs of the stalled recovery are immense. <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/february-2012/index.html\" title=\"\">The detail of the labour market figures</a> included the profoundly depressing news that 860,000 people have now been unemployed for more than a year. More than 300,000 claimed jobseeker's allowance \u2013 meant to be a temporary benefit \u2013 throughout 2011.</p> <p>More women are unemployed than at any time for a quarter of a century (and remember, the total includes only those looking for work, not those who have given up altogether), and more than a million young people are stuck on the shelf.</p> <p>The government has been careful not to release any data about the performance of its Work Programme, which is meant to give private sector firms the incentive to tackle tricky cases \u2013 drug-users, single mums who haven't worked for years, long-term sickness-benefit claimants who have now been declared fit for work.</p> <p>But the National Audit Office warned recently that the success rate of the scheme was likely to be far lower than the government assumes; and anecdotal evidence is of clients being \"parked\" on cut-price training courses, or coaxed into unpaid work experience, while the outsourcing firms pocket the payments for having them on their books.</p> <p>As George Osborne draws up his budget over the next month, he will need to tread extremely carefully to avoid alarming the gilts market, given his commitment to austerity.</p> <p>But he must also be aware that a prolonged period of slow or non-existent growth will undermine tax revenues and make his programme self-defeating. No amount of tough talk will stop investors eventually losing hope if growth fails to return \u2013 and that could unleash a damaging spiral of rising gilt yields, fresh austerity measures and rising interest rates.</p> <p>Osborne has already had to extend his planned spending cuts beyond the next election, to avoid missing his target for balancing the budget after the economy underperformed in 2011.</p> <p>Given the political mood and the markets' views, he can't chuck austerity out; but he could take some targeted measures, using cash raised elsewhere. If he does, the unemployed should be his first target.</p> <p>The Lib Dems' cherished aim of progressively raising the personal tax threshold towards \u00a310,000 is laudable, but, like the Work Programme, it was dreamt up in better times. Giving a tiny fillip to a very large number of people \u2013 many of them earning well above the average wage \u2013 is a luxury the government cannot afford. Many of the poorest in the population already pay no tax because they earn too little or nothing at all.</p> <p>Whether it's through cuts in national insurance for firms hiring the long-term unemployed, or a new targeted scheme along the lines of Nick Clegg's Youth Contract (which echoes Labour's Future Jobs Fund, shut down by the coalition), the 860,000 people who couldn't find a day's work in 2011 urgently need help if they are not to become dependent on costly handouts for many years to come.</p> <p>Judging by the noises emerging from Downing Street, the Tories are keen to use Moody's warning as a reason to brush off Clegg's demands to raise the personal allowance. They are right to do so, but that would not preclude raising new funds to pay for more targeted emergency measures from those who can best afford it. Levying a supertax on this year's bonus round, as Labour has suggested, would be a good place to start.</p>",
