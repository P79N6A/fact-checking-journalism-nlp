      "bodyText": "Leading women in British business, including the chief executive of Lloyd\u2019s of London, Inga Beale, have been recognised in the New Year honours list. Beale has been made a dame, while there are CBEs for the designer Anya Hindmarch, Rosaleen Blair, the founder of headhunting company Alexander Mann Solutions, and Justine Roberts, the co-founder of Mumsnet. Beale, 53, said she was \u201cincredibly proud of the work that we [Lloyd\u2019s] are doing to encourage diversity\u201d. She became chief executive of the insurance market in 2014, becoming the first woman to hold the position in Lloyd\u2019s 328-year history. In 2015, Beale became the first woman and bisexual person to top the annual power list of the world\u2019s leading 100 LGBT executives. \u201cLloyd\u2019s represents so much of what is good about British business and the insurance sector in particular,\u201d Beale said. \u201cThis honour is a reflection of the work and commitment of everyone who works within the Lloyd\u2019s market, enabling others to take risks that enable society to progress. \u201cI am also incredibly proud of the work that we are doing to encourage diversity. When I think back to what the workplace was like 30 years ago, we have come a long way on our journey to become a truly modern, global and inclusive sector.\u201d Robert said the honour was recognition for Mumsnet, the parenting website she co-founded in 2000, as a whole. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely thing to get a gong, and I\u2019m chuffed to bits,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in truth it\u2019s recognition of the energy and commitment that very many people, from our users to our staff, have put into making the rather simple idea of a forum where parents can swap information and advice into a living, breathing community that\u2019s still very much alive and kicking 17 years after its inception.\u201d Other business leaders to be honoured include Ian Powell, the former chairman of the PwC accountancy firm, who receives a knighthood. Powell stepped down from the post in the summer and will become chairman of outsourcing group Capita on 1 January. There is also a knighthood for John Campbell, the co-founder of egg producer Glenrath Farms. The former chairman of House of Fraser Don McCarthy has been awarded a CBE for services to business and philanthropy, while Jeremy Sinclair, the chairman of ad agency M&amp;C Saatchi, is recognised for services to advertising. Simon Walker, the outgoing director general of the Institute of Directors, collects a CBE. Walker described Sports Direct as a \u201cscar on British business\u201d after a Guardian investigation exposed working practices at the company. Barbara Judge, the chairman of the Institute of Directors, praised Walker and the women who received honours. \u201cSimon deserves warm congratulations for this well-deserved honour. He has been a tireless champion of good businesses, but has also not been afraid to call out poor practice and corporate governance failings where he sees them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been a privilege to work alongside him. He has shown the type of business leadership that we are going to need more of over the next few years, as the UK\u2019s relationship with the rest of the world shifts. \u201cI am very pleased that some outstanding women are being recognised for their achievements. Seeing female entrepreneurs like Anya Hindmarch awarded honours will act as a spur to other women to set up their own companies. Inga Beale also deserves congratulations for rising to the top of such a historically male-dominated industry.\u201d Figures linked to industry and the economy make up 11% of the new honours list, with women comprising just over 50% of the total list. Hazel Moore, the chairman and co-founder of investment bank First Capital, gets an OBE, and Nick Jones, the founder of private members\u2019 clubs group Soho House, receives an MBE. There is also an MBE for the entrepreneur who set up a successful sandwich chain that helps homeless people. Josh Littlejohn, the co-founder of Social Bite, said: \u201cI\u2019m honoured to receive this award in recognition for my work with Social Bite. \u201cI would like to dedicate it to the hundreds of homeless people Social Bite works with in Scotland who are marginalised from society and have no stake in the economic system. \u201cI\u2019m relatively young, but I hope to dedicate the rest of my working life to helping people who have been excluded from the system. \u201cBy working alongside the amazing Social Bite team \u2013 and other charities \u2013 I hope I can play my part in eradicating homelessness from Scotland and spread the social enterprise business model further afield.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The price of Brent crude tumbled below $30 per barrel for the first time in 13 years at the start of 2016 as worries over a supply glut intensified. The lifting of sanctions on Iran in January meant the oil producer could ramp up crude exports into a market already awash with supplies thanks to high production from US shale oil and the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). But prices recovered as the year progressed on signs of diminishing stocks and on growing expectations Opec would limit output. An agreement to cut supplies was reached at the end of the year between Opec and a number of non-members, sending oil to a 17-month high above $57. The price is up 54% over the year. A tumultuous year in global politics boosted demand for gold \u2013 seen as a safe haven in troubled times \u2013 and sent its price soaring for much of 2016. Appetite for gold was also boosted by low interest rates. Investors could get little or no return on cash and other assets that pay interest and so instead sought out investments such as gold. The precious metal lost some of its shine after markets digested Donald Trump\u2019s victory and the prospect of big government spending and interest rate rises in the US. As the US dollar and bond yields eased off in the final days of 2016, gold got a small fillip, ending slightly higher over the year as a whole. The pound has tumbled since the EU referendum, hitting 31-year lows this year. A US interest rate rise in December led the dollar to extend gains against sterling. The pound is down around 17% against the dollar since the Brexit vote. Conversely, the FTSE 100 share index has soared to record highs. Much of the FTSE\u2019s rise has been down to the pound\u2019s weakness: many of the firms listed report in dollars and so their earnings are flattered by the currency movements. The weak pound also encourages international investors to pick up UK-listed stocks and other assets such as property. The US stock index has soared to new highs in 2016, flirting with the 20,000 level. Worries about a potential wave of protectionism under president-elect Donald Trump have been more than offset by Wall Street\u2019s hopes that huge infrastructure spending and deregulation will boost the US economy \u2013 in the short-term at least. Since the election, banks have been among the top risers on US stock markets, helped by rising interest rates and expectations that Trump will relax regulations. The Baltic Dry index is looked to for early warning signs of trouble for the global economy. It measures dry freight costs for commodities such as coal, rice and wheat and, when it drops, economists start worrying about a slowdown in world trade and, by extension, in global economic activity. February was one such moment, when the index hit a record low of 290 points. It recovered as the year went on, with a spike in November after Trump\u2019s victory but, at 961 points, it remains well below its peak of 11,793 points in May 2008. The year began with fresh concerns about the extent of China\u2019s economic slowdown, sending shockwaves through global markets. Economists expect GDP growth for the full year to come in at under 7% again and fall further next year, in a marked contrast to the expansion of 14% experienced a decade ago. The slowdown was widely expected as China\u2019s economy matures but the nature of its growth has worried investors. As growth falters, Beijing has turned to debt-fuelled stimulus. That government spending drive combined with soaring property prices and record bank lending has prompted warnings about China\u2019s debt mountain. Mexico\u2019s currency had the dubious honour of acting as a barometer for Donald Trump\u2019s chance of victory in the US presidential race. After the Republican candidate threatened to build a wall between the US and Mexico and to scrap or rejig trade deals, the peso came under repeated pressure and slumped to an all-time low against the dollar after Trump\u2019s win. More recently, the peso has steadied as Trump appears to rein in his campaign trail rhetoric but analysts warn the Mexican currency faces more volatility once the new president is inaugurated in January. Low interest rates make it harder for banks to make a profit on the difference between the rates that are paid on savings and the rates that can be charged on loans. For evidence of what that means for banks\u2019 share prices, look no further than Japan in 2016. Japanese banking stocks were already under pressure from years of electronic money printing by the central bank and tumbled further early in the year as the Bank of Japan imposed negative interest rates on them to encourage lending to businesses. But in September, the bank changed tack from its aggressive stimulus programme and shares across the sector staged a recovery on hopes the pressure on their profitability will now ease. The European Central Bank has taken unprecendented measures to bolster anaemic growth in the currency bloc and to push up stubbornly low inflation. Despite ultra-low interest rates and a vast programme of electronic money printing, inflation remains well off the ECB goal of \u201cbelow, but close to, 2%\u201d. Economists also point to core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as energy, and has stuck around just 0.8% since the summer, suggesting there is little underlying upward pressure on prices. The ECB recently announced it was curbing the amount of stimulus it provides but its president, Mario Draghi, insisted the central bank remained ready to beef up its support if inflation fails to pick up. The crushing defeat for the Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi in a referendum on constitutional reform in December came amid stagnating living standards and one of the highest unemployment rates in the eurozone (pdf), at 11.6%. The situation among under-25s is worse still, with youth unemployment at more than 36%, compared with 29% five years ago. France has also experienced a rise in youth unemployment in recent years \u2013 the latest figures put it above 25% \u2013 a trend expected to influence voting patterns in the 2017 presidential election.",

      "bodyText": "The City of London has officially shut down for another year. Traders are heading to their favourite pubs and wine bars to mark the FTSE 100\u2019s record high, and to ponder what perils and delights 2017 bring. It\u2019s likely to be another white-knuckle ride, with Trump in the White House, Marine Le Pen trying to become French president, China battlign to avoid a hard landing, and Britain facing the sticky problem of negotiating an exit from the EU. That will probably add up to more market volatility -- this week\u2019s gentle trading will soon be just a memory. Until then, here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s events, by my colleague Nick Fletcher: The FTSE 100 has ended a tumultuous year at an all-time high, boosted by a surge in mining companies and dollar earners and hopes of a spending spree by US president-elect Donald Trump. Britain\u2019s blue chip index closed a shortened trading day at 7,142.83, up 22.57 points, beating the previous peak of 7,129.82 set in October. The record came as the index hit a closing high for the third day in a row. The index rose 14.4% over the course of the year, adding \u00a3232bn to the value of Britain\u2019s top companies and marking its best annual performance since 2013. It came despite the shocks of the Brexit referendum vote and Trump\u2019s election, and a slump to 5,499 in February on concerns about a slowdown in the global economy, particularly in China. The rise was driven by mining companies and overseas earners, which dominate the leading index. The FTSE mining index has jumped 100% over the year, with Anglo American the best performer, up 287%. Signs of recovery in China and the prospect of new infrastructure spending by the incoming US administration sparked the revival, while the 17% slump in the pound since the Brexit vote in June has benefited those companies that earn their money overseas. Over the year, sterling has fallen 16.5%, its worst performance since the financial crisis in 2008. But in dollar terms the FTSE 100 was actually down 5% over the year, owing to the decline in the pound. Analysts at KPMG said the performance of FTSE 100 companies with more than 70% of their market outside the UK was up 20% over the year. But those with 70% of their business in the UK were down 6%. KPMG\u2019s Yael Selfin said: \u201cPut in pounds and pence, this equates to a \u00a3226bn rise in the value of the KPMG Non-UK50 and a \u00a324bn loss for their domestic equivalent.\u201d Despite Brexit, the FTSE 100 was the best-performing European market, as continuing worries about the eurozone, the banking problems in Italy and the prospect of elections in Germany and France next year limited gains. Happy New Year to all our readers, and we\u2019ll see you in 2017. GW Over in Greece, 2016 is closing with the standoff between Athens and its creditors seemingly put to rest...but with no certainty that 2017 will finally resolve the country\u2019s great economic crisis. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports It\u2019s been a busy time for the Greek finance minister. Over the course of the past two weeks the emollient Euclid Tskalatos has had to use all his gifts of diplomacy to not only pacify euro zone partners of Greece\u2019s good intent, but persuade them that under stewardship of the left the debt-stricken country is far from bent on colliding with the institutions keeping it afloat. This the Oxford-educated economist did in a pre-Christmas letter that sought to dispel any notion that a bonus for low-income pensioners was more than a one-off and suspension of a VAT tax for Aegean isles (those, like Lesbos, on the frontline of the refugee crisis) would apply for longer than 2017. This letter appeased Greece\u2019s creditors enough for them to resume talks on short term measures that by 2060 would cut Greece\u2019s debt burden by around 20 percentage points. But this week Tskalatos\u2019 mollifying has been eclipsed by other mixed signals that Athens\u2019 leftist-led coalition has also sent out: signals that could dash government hopes of the country returning to capital markets, and being included in the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing program, in early 2017. On Wednesday, minister of state Alekos Flambouraris - prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 mentor and one of his closest aides - insisted that the government wouldn\u2019t hesitate to hand out bonuses again if it also managed to secure a budget surplus next year. The alternate defence minister soon followed saying Athens would extend the special VAT exemption into 2018 \u201cif the refugee crisis continues, and in my opinion it unfortunately will.\u201d Adding to the confusion, the government then announced that far from ruling out similar solidarity measures, Tskalalotos\u2019 letter \u201copens the ways for similar ones in the future.\u201d The doublespeak has enhanced speculation that Greece could be heading for elections if Athens\u2019 financial resuscitation plans don\u2019t come to pass. This week an MRB poll showed that 63 percent of Greeks believed snap polls were likely in 2017 mostly because of growing differences between Tsipras\u2019 administration and creditors. Prognostications are a mugs game. But of one thing we can be sure: the Greek crisis will continue \u2013 and we will be here to report it! European stock markets are ending 2016 with something of a whimper. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the 600 biggest listed companies in Europe, has lost around 1% this year. This chart, from Bloomberg, shows how European shares slid sharply in January and February (when worries over China rocked market), and then had a nasty dose of Brexit-itis in the summer. Another way of looking at things.... UK share prices have also benefitted from the largely robust economic data since the Brexit vote on June 23rd. Britain\u2019s economy grew by 0.6% in July-September, matching the growth rate in the three month\u2019s before the referendum. This refusal to buckle under the uncertainty created by Brexit has encouraged the City to pile into shares. Yael Selfin, head of macroeconomics at KPMG UK, explains (via Reuters) \u201cThe latest GDP figures point to a strong UK economy which has probably accounted for some of the pick-up in equity prices overall since the referendum.\u201d I don\u2019t want to sound alarmist, but the last time the FTSE 100 hit a record high on the last day of the year was 1999. That was swiftly followed by the dot-com crash, and a major slump in shares - with the FTSE 100 not recovering its losses until 2015. Tony Cross, communications director for the Social Stock Exchange (SSX), remembers it: On the upside, this rally is good for pension pots: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, predicts that markets will be lively next year - especially as the US has just expelled a bunch of Russian diplomats: With Obama\u2019s foot already out the door, it is clear that he is happy to speak out against the likes of Israel and Russia without fear of dealing with the repercussions. What is not clear is how things will pan out once the pro-Russian Trump comes into power. Should Trump immediately reverse this week\u2019s measures, it would not only say that he places little confidence in his own security services, but also shows that Russia can essentially do what they want without the chance of being reprimanded. US futures have edged off overnight highs..... It looks like a quiet end to a very busy year, but 2017 certainly promises to be just as eventful. The pound and the FTSE 100 have largely moved in opposite directions since Britain voted to leave the EU: (thanks to PA\u2019s Ian Jones) The Press Association also point out that the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote has driven shares up: The pound\u2019s fall, triggered by Britain\u2019s decision to quit the EU, has proved beneficial for multinational companies listed on the index as many tend to benefit from earnings in currencies - such as the US dollar - which are stronger than sterling. On Friday, sterling slumped further against the euro, falling 0.1% to 1.16 euro. The pound was up 0.5% against the dollar at 1.23. Sterling remains 18% down against the greenback and 11% lower versus the euro since the Brexit vote in June. Or in other words.... Mining companies had a great year. Share prices across the sector doubled in 2016, as the prices of commodities such as iron ore, copper and nickel rallied. The FTSE 250, which includes smaller UK-focused companies, ended 2016 up 3.7% for the year. The FTSE 250 is seen as a better gauge of the UK economy than the international giants that make up the FTSE 100. But it is also flattered by the pound\u2019s tumble against other currencies since June\u2019s referendum. NEWSFLASH: The FTSE 100 has closed for 2016 at a new record high, after sudden last-minute rally. The blue-chip index gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 7142 points. That\u2019s a new intraday high, and its third closing high in as many days. This means the FTSE has rallied by 14.4% this year, in spite of the political turbulence at home and abroad. We should keep in mind that the index is priced in sterling; it\u2019s still down around 4% in US dollar terms. Details and reaction to follow.... BOOM! The FTSE 100 just hit a new all-time high. It touched 7132 points, as City traders make one final push before the close of trading. That\u2019s just above the previous intraday high of 7129, and means the index has risen around 14% this year. With 10 minutes to go until the closing bell, the FTSE 100 is recovering its early losses! The blue-chip index is now UP 2 points on the day, at 7122. If it ends over 7121, it will be a new closing high - the third in as many days... The Bond Vigilante team at M&amp;G reckon 2017 will be a testing time for Europe, as public anger about austerity bubbles away. They write: Nowhere have the subjects of fiscal austerity and rising inequality been as relevant as in Europe today. Stubbornly high unemployment rates combined with declining living standards have contributed to rising levels of civil and political instability over the past year. Populist and nationalist parties have been able to capitalise on this phenomenon and raise massive amounts of support from exasperated European citizens. In Spain, for example, a caretaker government had to be put in place after two consecutive presidential elections failed to designate a clear winner. France will also face an important political test when it holds its presidential election in spring 2017. National Front leader Marine Le Pen will be trying to take advantage of the positive momentum she has built up to sweep her party to its first victory. While this would require a vast \u2013 and unlikely \u2013 swing from voters, recent events remind us that the rise of anti-establishment parties globally is not one to be underestimated. Equally, traditional polling methods seem to struggle to capture the swing to the hard right that is underway. These mounting pressures could not come at a worse time for Europe, whose 2017 political schedule looks particularly packed... The extra difficulty for Europe is that its capacity to boost growth and employment via increased public and infrastructure spending and tax cuts is more limited than other economies, for two main reasons. First of all, high levels of debt (Europe has an average debt-to-GDP ratio of 90% versus the 60% target of the Stability and Growth Pact) are forcing most European countries to rein in spending rather than increase it. Second, not having the ability to print money at an individual country level in the European Union (EU) requires each member to demonstrate even more fiscal discipline for the union to remain viable. For those mainstream European political parties wishing to claw back votes from their more extreme rivals, the challenge is therefore as follows: to improve the living standards of hundreds of millions of Europeans, while preserving the EU\u2019s balance sheet. This can only be achieved by implementing the right mix of pro-growth structural reforms, but some tough times could still lie ahead. That\u2019s a small part of their predictions for 2017, which they say will be \u201ca whole new ball game\u201d. Worth a read. Investors will be toasting their successes this weekend, or grumbling bitterly about having backed the wrong horses. London\u2019s stock market wasn\u2019t the best place to put your money this year, despite the FTSE 100\u2019s 13% leap. Brazil\u2019s stock market outperformed all rivals this year, according to Bloomberg data. That\u2019s quite staggering, given the country has suffered a historically bad recession, rising unemployment, plus political turmoil and the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff. Investors are betting that Brazil can claw its way back to growth, and that Rousseff\u2019s successor, Michel Temer, will push through structural reforms. Richard Stone, chief executive of stockbroking firm The Share Centre, has stuck his neck out with three predictions for 2017. He reckons that the UK economy will outperform expectations, leading to the first interest rate rise since the financial crisis. Stone says: Unemployment remains low and employment is at near record levels. The boost from Sterling\u2019s devaluation will continue to feed through \u2013 particularly for exporters to the EU who still have unfettered access to the single market but with substantially lower pricing in Euro terms. Inflation will rise, in part as a function of the impact of weaker Sterling, but also as a result of the relatively tight labour market. Without substantial changes in productivity this will likely start to feed through into higher wages. In Europe, he expects populist parties to increase their support - but not win power in Germany, France or the Netherlands. \u201cThe level of disaffection in Europe is just as strong as it is elsewhere in the world, but the political and voting systems are very different. This means that those expressions of discontent are less likely to have the same success as they did in the binary choices that were presented by the Brexit and US Presidential Election votes. In particular the coalition nature of politics in the Netherlands and Germany, along with the run-off process for the French Presidential election, mean that although extremist politicians may make advances their ability to gain power is limited \u2013 so I would not expect any great surprises. And he fears that US relations with China will deteriorate under president Trump: \u201cJanuary will see the inauguration of President Donald Trump and we will then start to see how his policy pronouncements play out. In the US the power of the President is constrained by the checks and balances inherent in the system, particularly in Congress. However, the President still has significant sway on foreign policy and trade. \u201cRelations with China \u2013 if the current mood music is to be believed \u2013 may become more difficult. This in turn could impact trade. Conversely relations with Russia may soften which might alleviate some of the political tensions currently on the global stage. Stone also suspects Beijing may have to devalue the renminbi next year in an attempt to stimulate growth, which might cause market volatility (as it did in August 2015). The FTSE 100\u2019s merry upward romp has been welcomed by eurosceptics as a sign that the economy is in good shape following June\u2019s referendum. Conservative MP Michael Gove (who campaigned for Vote Leave, and was rewarded with demotion to the back benches), tweeted last night that the Footsie had hit a record high \u201cdespite Brexit\u201d. It would be more accurate to say that the rally is \u2018because Brexit thumped the pound\u2019. As this chart shows, the FTSE 100 is still down 5% this year when priced in US dollars (the light blue line): 2016 has been a vintage year for the oil price. Brent crude prices have jumped by 53% this year, while US crude prices are up 46% - the biggest jump since 2009. For once Opec can take the credit. The oil cartel put its bickering behind it this year, by uniting behind an agreement to cut production by over one million barrels per day. That has lifted Brent crude to $57.05 per barrel this morning, which I fear will soon feed through to higher prices at the pumps. The year is ending on a subdued note, with the main European stock markets all in the red. The FTSE 100 is down 20 points from last night\u2019s record close, at 7100 points, in extremely light trading. And Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 has dropped 0.15%, meaning it\u2019s on track for its first annual loss since 2011. The latest deterioration in relations between Washington and Moscow will surely encourage investors to sit on the sidelines today, and see how Vladimir Putin responds to the expulsion of 35 diplomats. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Fresh geopolitical fun and games are taking centre stage with Obama taking a final swipe at Russia before he leaves office. China\u2019s stock market has just closed for the year, down 12%. That\u2019s actually quite a recovery since the wild plunges in early January, which forced regulators to suspend trading altogether a few times. The other European stock markets have lagged behind the FTSE 100 this year. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has lost 10% during a year dominated by worries over its banks, and a political crisis. Germany\u2019s DAX gained 6.4% while France\u2019s CAC rose by 4%. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index dropped by 1.6%. This multicoloured tweet from Reuters\u2019 Atul Prakash shows how each index has performed every year since 2000: (That\u2019s the FTSE 100 on the top, then the Stoxx 600, the Dax, the CAC, and finally the FTSE MIB) Apologies, I might have forgotten to turn comments on the blog this morning (or they turned themselves off!). Anyway, they\u2019re on now. We shouldn\u2019t forget that the FTSE 100 has also benefitted from the slump in sterling this year since the Brexit vote. The Footsie is packed with internationally focused companies; a cheap pound makes UK exports more competitive, and also raises the value of overseas earnings. So while the FTSE 100 is up 13.8% this year, it\u2019s actually down over 5% when priced in US dollars. Bloomberg\u2019s Lorcan Roche Kelly wrote the definitive analysis on this issue recently.... Mining stocks have played a major role in driving the FTSE 100 up this year. The mining section of the FTSE 100 has jumped by 100% this year, helped by a recovery in commodity prices after a torrid 2015. That\u2019s its best performance since 2009. Anglo American, for example, has almost quadrupled in value since January 1st. Miners are benefitting from optimism about the global economy next year, and the prospect of Donald Trump boosting US infrastructure spending. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is on track to post its biggest annual gain in three years. Despite the political shocks that rocked markets this year, the blue-chip index has gained 13.8% since January 1st. That\u2019s its best performance since 2013, when it gained 14.4%, and follows two years of losses. It wasn\u2019t plain sailing through. Having begun January at 6,242 points, the Footsie slumped to 5,536 by mid-February, as global markets were spooked by Chinese slowdown fears. It then recovered, before a wobbly June - the index crashed by 6% after the EU referendum. But the FTSE 10 soon bounced back and we saw further gains in the summer and autumn. Finally, Trump\u2019s shock election win sparked a late rally, as this chart shows: We\u2019ve nearly made it! After a turbulent 12 months, there\u2019s just one more trading session to go until we can consign 2016 to history and face the worst that the new year can throw at us. Given that includes President Trump, the Brexit negotiations, and key elections in France and Germany, we might not want to rush into 2017 too enthusiastically, of course. But right now, City investors are hoping that the global economy could shrug off these concerns and strengthen next year. That helped the FTSE 100 to hit closing record highs on Wednesday and Thursday, and there\u2019s a chance we could see a hat-trick today. The opens aren\u2019t great, though -- the blue-chip index has dropped by a few points at the start of trading, having closed at 7120 last night. The all-time intraday high, incidentally, is 7129 points, so well within reach if City traders get all excitable. Trading ends at 12.30pm chaps, so get those orders in fast. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day, and looking back at the best and worst of 2016.",

The record came as the index hit a closing high for the third day in a row.</p> <p>The index rose 14.4% over the course of the year, adding \u00a3232bn to the value of Britain\u2019s top companies and marking its best annual performance since 2013.</p> <p>It came despite the shocks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/24/ftse-100-and-sterling-plunge-on-brexit-panic\">the Brexit referendum vote</a> and Trump\u2019s election, and a slump to 5,499 in February on concerns about a slowdown in the global economy, particularly in China.</p> <p>The rise was driven by mining companies and overseas earners, which dominate the leading index. The FTSE mining index has jumped 100% over the year, with Anglo American the best performer, up 287%. Signs of recovery in China and the prospect of new infrastructure spending by the incoming US administration sparked the revival, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">the 17% slump in the pound since the Brexit vote in June</a> has benefited those companies that earn their money overseas. Over the year, sterling has fallen 16.5%, its worst performance since the financial crisis in 2008.</p> <p>But in dollar terms the FTSE 100 was actually down 5% over the year, owing to the decline in the pound. Analysts at KPMG said the performance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse\">FTSE</a> 100 companies with more than 70% of their market outside the UK was up 20% over the year.

Over the course of the past two weeks the emollient Euclid Tskalatos has had to use all his gifts of diplomacy to not only pacify euro zone partners of Greece\u2019s good intent, but persuade them that under stewardship of the left the debt-stricken country is far from bent on colliding with the institutions keeping it afloat. </p> <p>This the Oxford-educated economist did in a pre-Christmas letter that sought to dispel any notion that a bonus for low-income pensioners was more than a one-off and suspension of a VAT tax for Aegean isles (those, like Lesbos, on the frontline of the refugee crisis) would apply for longer than 2017. This letter appeased Greece\u2019s creditors enough for them to resume talks on short term measures that by 2060 would cut Greece\u2019s debt burden by around 20 percentage points. </p> <p>But this week Tskalatos\u2019 mollifying has been eclipsed by other mixed signals that Athens\u2019 leftist-led coalition has also sent out: signals that could dash government hopes of the country returning to capital markets, and being included in the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing program, in early 2017.</p> <p>On Wednesday, minister of state Alekos Flambouraris - prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 mentor and one of his closest aides - insisted that the government wouldn\u2019t hesitate to hand out bonuses again if it also managed to secure a budget surplus next year. The alternate defence minister soon followed saying Athens would extend the special VAT exemption into 2018 \u201cif the refugee crisis continues, and in my opinion it unfortunately will.\u201d</p> <p>Adding to the confusion, the government then announced that far from ruling out similar solidarity measures, Tskalalotos\u2019 letter \u201copens the ways for similar ones in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The doublespeak has enhanced speculation that Greece could be heading for elections if Athens\u2019 financial resuscitation plans don\u2019t come to pass. This week an MRB poll showed that 63 percent of Greeks believed snap polls were likely in 2017 mostly because of growing differences between Tsipras\u2019 administration and creditors. </p> <p><strong>Prognostications are a mugs game. But of one thing we can be sure: the Greek crisis will continue \u2013 and we will be here to report it!</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58666fcae4b08d2df8a6cd68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-30T14:48:09.413Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>European stock markets are ending 2016 with something of a whimper.</strong></p> <p>The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the 600 biggest listed companies in Europe, has lost around 1% this year.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-30/european-stocks-are-little-changed-on-final-trading-day-of-2016?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">This chart, from Bloomberg</a>, shows how European shares slid sharply in January and February (when worries over China rocked market), and then had a nasty dose of Brexit-itis in the summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc235f883e1a45ebd132b445603ef8d4b10dc1a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc235f883e1a45ebd132b445603ef8d4b10dc1a8/0_0_1200_675/1000.png\" alt=\"Stoxx 600 this year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58667306e4b0c44bce1ef237\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-30T14:46:25.794Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another way of looking at things....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Pete_Spence/status/814843535358824448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The FTSE is up for 2016, but not as much as the pound is down.

Stubbornly high unemployment rates combined with declining living standards have contributed to rising levels of civil and political instability over the past year. Populist and nationalist parties have been able to capitalise on this phenomenon and raise massive amounts of support from exasperated European citizens.</p> <p>In Spain, for example, a caretaker government had to be put in place after two consecutive presidential elections failed to designate a clear winner. France will also face an important political test when it holds its presidential election in spring 2017. National Front leader Marine Le Pen will be trying to take advantage of the positive momentum she has built up to sweep her party to its first victory. While this would require a vast \u2013 and unlikely \u2013 swing from voters, recent events remind us that the rise of anti-establishment parties globally is not one to be underestimated. Equally, traditional polling methods seem to struggle to capture the swing to the hard right that is underway.</p> <p>These mounting pressures could not come at a worse time for Europe, whose 2017 political schedule looks particularly packed...</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ba9db2f428c277ddbbdaddf7a737479bb2ed1ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ba9db2f428c277ddbbdaddf7a737479bb2ed1ba/0_0_960_720/500.png\" alt=\"Key European developments in 2017\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The extra difficulty for Europe is that its capacity to boost growth and employment via increased public and infrastructure spending and tax cuts is more limited than other economies, for two main reasons. First of all, high levels of debt (Europe has an average debt-to-GDP ratio of 90% versus the 60% target of the Stability and Growth Pact) are forcing most European countries to rein in spending rather than increase it. Second, not having the ability to print money at an individual country level in the European Union (EU) requires each member to demonstrate even more fiscal discipline for the union to remain viable.</p> <p>For those mainstream European political parties wishing to claw back votes from their more extreme rivals, the challenge is therefore as follows: to improve the living standards of hundreds of millions of Europeans, while preserving the EU\u2019s balance sheet. This can only be achieved by implementing the right mix of pro-growth structural reforms, but some tough times could still lie ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s a small part of their predictions for 2017, which they say will be \u201ca whole new ball game\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.bondvigilantes.com/blog/panoramic-outlook/2017-a-whole-new-ball-game/\">Worth a read</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bondvigilantes/status/814790342797127685\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are a few hours left in the 2016 work year.

Without substantial changes in productivity this will likely start to feed through into higher wages. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>In Europe, he expects populist parties to increase their support - but not win power in Germany, France or the Netherlands.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe level of disaffection in Europe is just as strong as it is elsewhere in the world, but the political and voting systems are very different. This means that those expressions of discontent are less likely to have the same success as they did in the binary choices that were presented by the Brexit and US Presidential Election votes.</p> <p>In particular the coalition nature of politics in the Netherlands and Germany, along with the run-off process for the French Presidential election, mean that although extremist politicians may make advances their ability to gain power is limited \u2013 so I would not expect any great surprises.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And he fears that US relations with China will deteriorate under president Trump:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cJanuary will see the inauguration of President Donald Trump and we will then start to see how his policy pronouncements play out. In the US the power of the President is constrained by the checks and balances inherent in the system, particularly in Congress. However, the President still has significant sway on foreign policy and trade.</p> <p>\u201cRelations with China \u2013 if the current mood music is to be believed \u2013 may become more difficult. This in turn could impact trade. Conversely relations with Russia may soften which might alleviate some of the political tensions currently on the global stage.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stone also suspects Beijing may have to devalue the renminbi next year in an attempt to stimulate growth, which might cause market volatility (as it did in August 2015).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-586636e0e4b0fcf474af6139\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-30T10:37:53.646Z\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The FTSE 100\u2019s merry upward romp has been welcomed by eurosceptics </strong><strong>as a sign that the economy is in good shape following June\u2019s referendum.</strong></p> <p>Conservative MP Michael Gove (who campaigned for Vote Leave, and was rewarded with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/michael-gove-sacked-as-justice-secretary-as-rival-johnson-gets-plum-job\">demotion to the back benches</a>), tweeted last night that the Footsie had hit a record high \u201cdespite Brexit\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/814586218524659716\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Despite Brexit <a href=\"https://t.co/pQAH5BP6LU\">https://t.co/pQAH5BP6LU</a></p>&mdash; Michael Gove (@michaelgove) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/814586218524659716\">December 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It would be more accurate to say that the rally is \u2018because Brexit thumped the pound\u2019. </p> <p>As this chart shows, the FTSE 100 is still down 5% this year when priced in US dollars (the light blue line):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/flacqua/status/814756761437687808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">my chart of the year <a href=\"https://t.co/olBIVeXXZF\">pic.twitter.com/olBIVeXXZF</a></p>&mdash; Francine Lacqua (@flacqua) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flacqua/status/814756761437687808\">December 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-586626f2e4b0fcf474af60fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-30T10:11:05.081Z\">10.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2a0968fc81367dcd1f1bf9249d70c4710a2b677d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a0968fc81367dcd1f1bf9249d70c4710a2b677d/0_0_3000_1979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two under construction offshore oil platform rigs in Port Fourchon, Louisiana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>2016 has been a vintage year for the oil price.</strong></p> <p>Brent crude prices have jumped by 53% this year, while US crude prices are up 46% - the biggest jump since 2009.</p> <p>For once Opec can take the credit.

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 has ended a tumultuous year at an all-time high, boosted by a surge in mining companies and dollar earners and hopes of a spending spree by the US president-elect Donald Trump. Britain\u2019s blue chip index closed a shortened trading day at 7,142.83, up 22.57 points, beating the previous intra-day peak of 7,129.82 set in October. It was the third day in a row that the the index hit a closing high. Over the course of the year, it rose 14.4%, adding \u00a3232bn to the value of Britain\u2019s top companies and marking its best annual performance since 2013, a time when recessionary fears were abating and the Greek crisis seemed to be easing. It came within a whisker of recording its biggest yearly rise since 2009. The new peak came despite the shocks of the Brexit referendum vote and Trump\u2019s election, and a slump to 5,499 in February on concerns about a slowdown in the global economy, particularly in China. The end-of-year close is almost 30% higher than the February low. The rise was driven by mining companies and overseas earners, which dominate the leading index. The FTSE mining index has jumped 100% over the year, with Anglo American the best performer, up 287%. Signs of recovery in China and the prospect of new infrastructure spending by the incoming US administration sparked the revival, while the 17% slump in the pound since the Brexit vote in June has benefited those companies that earn their money overseas. Over the year, sterling has fallen 16.5%, its worst performance since the financial crisis in 2008 when it lost 26.5%. A stable performance from the UK economy despite the dire warnings ahead of the EU referendum also provided support, and a recovery in the oil price was also factor in the rise of commodity companies. Banking shares moved higher in the second half of the year on signs that the prolonged period of low interest rates could be over, with the US Federal Reserve raising borrowing costs in December and the likelihood of a UK rate rise increasing. In dollar terms, however, the FTSE 100 was actually down 5% over the year, because of the decline in the pound. Analysts at KPMG said the performance of FTSE 100 companies with more than 70% of their market outside the UK was up 20% over the year. But those with 70% of their business in the UK were down 6%. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 also rose during the year, but by a much less impressive 3.71%. Despite fears that the Brexit vote would have serious repercussions, the FTSE 100 was the best-performing European market, as continuing worries about the eurozone, banking problems in Italy and the prospect of elections in Germany and France next year limited gains. Germany\u2019s Dax added 6.87% over the course of 2016, and France\u2019s Cac climbed 4.86%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 10.2% as the banking worries, most recently the proposed state bailout of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, combined with the resignation of the country\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to unnerve investors. Spain\u2019s Ibex lost 2.01%. US markets were boosted by the Trump effect, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting new peaks during the year and flirting with the 20,000 barrier. Brazil\u2019s Ibovespa stock market index was the best performer of 2016, up 63% on hopes that the recently appointed president, Michel Temer, could bring some stability to the country and end the worst recession for decades. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite fell 12%, failing to recover all of its losses from earlier in the year, with a weak currency and unpredictable actions from policymakers blamed for the declines. Gold rose 9% after three years of decline, benefitting from its status as a haven for investors during the political and economic uncertainty earlier in the year, although it lost some of its lustre as December approached. Brent crude prices jumped nearly 53%, both on signs of economic recovery but mainly due to a long-awaited agreement between Opec and other oil producers to curb output. This marked the biggest annual gain since 2009. Despite the FTSE 100 reaching its new peak, analysts said 2017 could be more volatile, with impact of European elections, the triggering of Brexit discussions and the reality of Donald Trump in the White House. There could also be a delayed impact on the UK economy from sterling\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote feeding through to higher prices. KPMG\u2019s Yael Selfin said: \u201cWe could start to see weaker consumer spending as inflation starts to bite which in turn may impact our indices in 2017.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u201cDo I have to have a beer with either of them?\u201d asks Iain Wright, the chairman of the Commons\u2019 business select committee, when quizzed about which, of the two billionaires he interrogated during 2016, he would choose to meet for a Christmas pint. \u201cDo you know what? I think Mike Ashley would like a pint more than [Sir] Philip Green,\u201d the Labour MP for Hartlepool says. \u201cI don\u2019t think Philip Green would want a pint. I think he\u2019d probably want an extraordinarily expensive bottle of champagne ... and then he\u2019d get me to pay for it.\u201d The quote just about sums up the year Wright has experienced at the centre of two separate scandals that engulfed a pair of Britain\u2019s best known and wealthiest retailers. There are parts of his statement that appear conciliatory, but then plenty more that would irk both tycoons who, according to Wright, have come to encapsulate the corporate excess that may have contributed to the country voting to leave the European Union. Ashley was hauled in front of Wright\u2019s business committee over working conditions at his sportswear chain Sports Direct, in the wake of a Guardian investigation that showed the company\u2019s warehouse workers were being paid less than the national minimum wage. Business people have been dragged in front of MPs for much less, yet Ashley\u2019s appearance did not happen without a fight. The billionaire owner of Newcastle United football club initially refused to attend, despite Wright\u2019s committee taking the unusual step of issuing him with a formal summons and then threatening to find him in contempt of parliament \u2013 an ancient offence which theoretically is punishable by imprisonment. But parliament\u2019s powers are so archaic that they may no longer be practically enforceable, meaning it was always unclear what could be done to Ashley if he failed to show \u2013 a move that would have put the whole select committee system on trial. At that moment, there must have been a lot of pressure on Wright? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel any pressure at all,\u201d he claims. \u201cMaybe I should have. I felt it was a point of principle. Nobody\u2019s bigger than parliament \u2013 I felt so strongly about that and I was keen to go to the wire ... You don\u2019t refuse to come to a select committee \u2013 you just don\u2019t. \u201cIf necessary I would have been pushing to change the law to make sure it was a legal requirement to attend,\u201d Wright adds. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen with the likes of Margaret Hodge [the former chair of the public accounts committee] ... fantastic work [has been done by] the select committee. And all of that could have been put under threat if people think they don\u2019t have to go.\u201d In the end, Ashley not only backed down but also made a string of admissions under the committee\u2019s questioning, including acknowledging that Sports Direct had broken the law by not paying the minimum wage and confessing that he is struggling to control the company he founded and in which he still owns a majority stake. Wright\u2019s committee responded with a report accusing Ashley of running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse and building his success on a business model that treats workers \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d. A selection of the committee\u2019s MPs then showed up at the firm\u2019s controversial warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, for an impromptu inspection, which memorably ended with Wright accusing the company of secretly recording his group during a private meeting. \u201cI\u2019m still keen to work with him,\u201d Wright insists. \u201cI think the recording device suggests a real level of distrust.\u201d The same might be said of the parliamentarian\u2019s relationship with Green. The retail knight was questioned over the collapse of BHS and the \u00a3571m shortfall in its pension fund by a joint parliamentary committee, made up of Wright\u2019s committee plus the work and pensions committee, led by Frank Field. While Wright, a former accountant, pulls very few punches, there is still an obvious contrast in style with Field, the veteran Labour MP who went on radio to compare Green with the pension plunderer Robert Maxwell. Green was furious with Field \u2013 and remains so \u2013 and the MP\u2019s lawyers apparently had to provide an assurance he had not meant to accuse Green of theft. But was the soundbite part of an agreed strategy, or did it come as a surprise to Wright? \u201cHe\u2019d mentioned it privately to me, yeah,\u201d Wright says. \u201cHe\u2019ll understand what went on in the early 90s with Maxwell. I can see similarities in terms [of a ] corporate governance element. Frank\u2019s entitled to say what he likes. There was an element of different styles, an element of different personalities coming to the fore, but we were definitely speaking all together.\u201d If Wright was pleased with how his report on Sports Direct came out, he was even more proud of the BHS one co-written with Field, which found that the department store had been subjected to \u201csystematic plunder\u201d by former owners including Green, who gave \u201cinsufficient priority\u201d to the BHS pension scheme that slumped to a \u00a3571m deficit. Wright described the 60-page document as \u201cmy Sgt Pepper\u201d. So, who was John and who was Paul? \u201cOne of the great thing about the Beatles \u2013 and you can hear it in Abbey Road particularly \u2013 is the harmonies and I think the way we harmonised together was really strong,\u201d Wright says. \u201cWe worked as one team, we left our committee badges at the door, we left our party affiliation at the door and we just worked to see what on earth went wrong here and how we try to mitigate that.\u201d He eventually settles on Field as Lennon, while also lauding a pair of Conservative MPs \u2013 Jeremy Quin from the pensions committee and Richard Fuller from Wright\u2019s own business committee \u2013 for their contributions. Even so, the two inquiries have had different outcomes. While the Sports Direct saga eventually produced some benefit for the poorly paid workers, when the \u00a31m backpay deal was unveiled in August, Wright still seems to view the company\u2019s efforts as a work in progress. Meanwhile, the BHS pension scandal rumbles on into 2017, with Green still promising to \u201csort\u201d the deficit and the pension regulator launching formal legal proceedings in November against Green and Dominic Chappell, the businessman he sold BHS to for \u00a31. Given the different outcomes, it would be good to know if Wright sees his Christmas pint glass as half empty or half full.",

A selection of the committee\u2019s MPs then showed up at the firm\u2019s controversial warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, for an impromptu inspection, which memorably ended with Wright accusing the company of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/sports-direct-denies-knowledge-of-secret-camera-filming-mps-shirebrook-warehouse\">secretly recording his group during a private meeting</a>.</li> <li><br></li> <li>\u201cI\u2019m still keen to work with him,\u201d Wright insists. \u201cI think the recording device suggests a real level of distrust.\u201d</li> <li><br></li> <li>The same might be said of the parliamentarian\u2019s relationship with Green. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/mps-sir-philip-greens-reputation-and-knighthood-depend-on-pension-offer\">The retail knight was questioned over the collapse of BHS</a> and the \u00a3571m shortfall in its pension fund by a joint parliamentary committee, made up of Wright\u2019s committee plus the work and pensions committee, led by Frank Field.</li> <li> <br></li> <li>While Wright, a former accountant, pulls very few punches, there is still an obvious contrast in style with Field, the veteran Labour MP who went on radio to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/mp-says-sir-philip-green-worse-than-robert-maxwell\">compare Green with the pension plunderer Robert Maxwell</a>. Green was furious with Field \u2013 and remains so \u2013 and the MP\u2019s lawyers apparently had to provide an assurance he had not meant to accuse Green of theft. </li> <li><br></li> <li>But was the soundbite part of an agreed strategy, or did it come as a surprise to Wright? \u201cHe\u2019d mentioned it privately to me, yeah,\u201d Wright says. \u201cHe\u2019ll understand what went on in the early 90s with Maxwell. I can see similarities in terms [of a ] corporate governance element. Frank\u2019s entitled to say what he likes. There was an element of different styles, an element of different personalities coming to the fore, but we were definitely speaking all together.\u201d</li> <li><br></li> <li>If Wright was pleased with how his report on Sports Direct came out, he was even more proud of the BHS one co-written with Field, which found that the department store had been subjected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report\">\u201csystematic plunder\u201d by former owners including Green</a>, who gave \u201cinsufficient priority\u201d to the BHS pension scheme that slumped to a \u00a3571m deficit.</li> <li><br></li> <li>Wright described the 60-page document as \u201cmy Sgt Pepper\u201d. So, who was John and who was Paul?</li> <li><br></li> <p>\u201cOne of the great thing about the Beatles \u2013 and you can hear it in Abbey Road particularly \u2013 is the harmonies and I think the way we harmonised together was really strong,\u201d Wright says. \u201cWe worked as one team, we left our committee badges at the door, we left our party affiliation at the door and we just worked to see what on earth went wrong here and how we try to mitigate that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15af9b75b71e64bf618e97bbfe5a73a02f43be3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15af9b75b71e64bf618e97bbfe5a73a02f43be3d/0_2_1555_933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley gives evidence to the business select committee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He eventually settles on Field as Lennon, while also lauding a pair of Conservative MPs \u2013 Jeremy Quin from the pensions committee and Richard Fuller from Wright\u2019s own business committee \u2013 for their contributions. </p> <p>Even so, the two inquiries have had different outcomes. While the Sports Direct saga eventually produced some benefit for the poorly paid workers, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/sports-direct-staff-to-receive-back-pay-unite-hmrc\">\u00a31m backpay deal was unveiled in August</a>, Wright still seems to view the company\u2019s efforts as a work in progress.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the BHS pension scandal rumbles on into 2017, with Green still promising to \u201csort\u201d the deficit and the pension regulator launching formal legal proceedings in November against Green and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/dominic-chappell\">Dominic Chappell</a>, the businessman he sold BHS to for \u00a31.</p> <p>Given the different outcomes, it would be good to know if Wright sees his Christmas pint glass as half empty or half full.</p>",
