      "bodyText": "Whenever talk turns to the budget or tax or when politicians enter into campaign mode you can be sure there will be mention of ordinary or middle Australians. But who are these people? The latest taxation statistics allow us to see the occupations of people who are earning the median Australian income, and not all of them fit the usual list of people uttered by politicians. The taxation statistics since 2003-04 have broken down all taxpayers into 100 income percentiles. In 2003-04 for example, if you had a taxable income of more than $68,807 you could class yourself as being in the top 10%; in 2013-14 you would have needed to have earned over $117,647 to be in that wealthy group. The median income has likewise grown. In 2003-03 the median taxable income was between $34,214; by 2009-10 it was up to $45,736 and in 2013-14 if you earned between $53,548 to $54,369 you were smack in the middle of the 9.7m Australians with a taxable income. The average incomes for each percentile rise in a pretty consistent way \u2013 until you get to the very wealthiest. For example the average income of those in the 60th percentile is 16.7% larger than those in the 50th percentile and the average income of those in the 80th percentile is 19.8% larger than that of the 70th. But the average income of those in the 90th is 34.9% more than in the 80th; and the average income of the 100th percentile is a jaw dropping 481% larger at $698,574: While few argue over whether or not they\u2019re in the top 1%, there is a large contest over who should be in the \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d bracket. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, when arguing about negative gearing likes to talk of \u201cordinary people \u2013 nurses, police officers, defence force personnel\u201d. On 2 March he suggested again that the ALP\u2019s policy \u201cwill punish the nurses, the paramedics, the police officers, the servicemen and women of this country, the tram drivers, the train drivers\u201d. Malcolm Turnbull has also got in on the ordinary Australian listings, referring to \u201cnurses, teachers and emergency service workers\u201d and \u201cgeneral clerks\u201d. So how ordinary are these people in such professions? The answer, as you would expect, is not clear cut. Firstly what is someone on a median income? I\u2019ve decided to give 10% wriggle room \u2013 from the 40th to 60th percentile. From the 60th percentile on, we\u2019re talking people earning $10,000 more than those on the 50th percentile. Of course this is no hard and fast measure, but I don\u2019t think we should devalue the reality of those actually in the middle by adding in people clearly earning much more than they do. The other problem is the tax data only looks at individuals and not households. Thus we don\u2019t know if someone in the 50th percentile income is living with someone earning a 90th percentile income. But given politicians refer to occupations, I think we can leave that aspect to one side for the moment. Firstly it is pretty clear why nurses always get a big mention. In 2013-14, the average income of the 96,825 women listed as \u201cgeneral\u201d registered nurses was just above the median at $55,240. But the data clearly shows that a nurse is not a nurse is not a nurse. And as with pretty much every occupation, male nurses also tend to earn more. The 9,417 male general registered nurses had an average taxable income of $65,313 \u2013 placing them in the 63th percentile: Male emergency nurses and mental health nurses earned just over $74,000 \u2013 putting them in the top 30%. But overall most nurses (especially female ones) such as the 40,900 classed as \u201cmedical\u201d and the 20,200 classed as \u201cnurse practitioners\u201d are well within the middle Australia band. The same cannot be said for police officers, tram and train drivers and paramedics. The only ones of those occupations who fall within the 40-60 percentile band are female paramedics \u2013 their average income of $63,265 is 20% lower than the average for their male counterparts of $79,711: Both men and women police officers had average incomes well above the median band, with men on an average income of $85,451. Given it puts them within the 78th percentile, I\u2019d suggest claims they are representative of an ordinary Australian income would not hold up to close interrogation. Train drivers really should also be banished from such definitions. Male train drivers had an average income in 2013-14 of $106,728 \u2013 putting them in the richest 14%. The situation with teachers is a bit more complex. Once again being male makes a big difference \u2013 39% of male teachers earned over $80,000 compared to 26% of women teachers: And as far as average incomes go, in 2013-14 most male teachers were above the 60th percentile, whereas most women teachers were not: Here the impact of teaching part-time really kicks in. Across all industries, around 30% of all workers are part-time, but in the education and training industry it is almost a third higher at around 39%: As I\u2019ve noted previously, women are more likely to be the ones who work part-time, and so while their hourly wage might be the same as their male colleagues, on average the amount they take home in a year is much less. Female secondary teachers earned on average 10% less, which is a bit odd given there were around 32,000 more women secondary teachers than men. The part-time implication is true as well for clerks, who are virtually all easily within the middle Australian band: But the situation for defence personnel again depends upon which specific group. The large numbers in \u201cother ranks\u201d (that is, not officers) are certainly within the middle band, whereas officers, both junior and certainly senior ones, are not: Of course most defence personnel don\u2019t have to pay the Medicare levy, which is why for example only a quarter of the nearly 19,000 non-officer defence personnel earning between $37,000 and $80,000 pay the Medicare levy \u2013 compared to 97% of everyone else within that tax bracket. So politicians are, for the most part, on safe ground with their list of ordinary Australians but they do tend as well to throw in some occupations such as train drivers, police officers and teachers who often earn rather more than the median income, especially if they are men. The figures once again highlight that even within \u201cordinary\u201d Australia, women\u2019s income is likely to be much more ordinary. This applies of course also to the wealthiest. When divided by gender, women account for only 2 of the highest 30 earning occupations: And is there any stat that highlights the issue of gender pay gap better than that the 641 men gynaecologists had an average income 68% higher than that of the 570 women of that profession?",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI will start by saying clearly and categorically that Hinkley Point C will go ahead,\u201d declared Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, the UK end of the French state-owned company that is supposed to be building the \u00a318bn nuclear plant in Somerset. So that\u2019s a definite yes? Not exactly. It\u2019s a definite maybe because, as de Rivaz was obliged to concede in the next breath to MPs on the energy select committee, he cannot say when an investment decision will be made. That is because events are out of his and EDF\u2019s hands. Everything depends on the willingness of the French government to bail out an overindebted company that already faces the costly challenge of upgrading France\u2019s nuclear generating capacity. The French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, this week floated the notion of supplying the funds and making a final investment decision on Hinkley in early May, but it was unclear whether this \u201cdeadline\u201d has any greater force than the others that have come and gone. The Conservative MP James Heappey summed up the true state of affairs: \u201cIf the French government doesn\u2019t commit to that recapitalisation, you can\u2019t build us a power station because you\u2019ve not got the cash.\u201d De Rivaz, instead of agreeing with a plainly correct statement, descended into yet more bluster about how confident he remains. It was excruciating to watch. The best thing the UK government could do, as argued here for ages, is to call the whole thing off and write a better energy policy for the 2020s. EDF\u2019s European pressurised reactor model is unproven and the versions under construction in Finland and France are nine and six years behind schedule respectively. Not only this, but the cost of Hinkley is hideous for future UK consumers. The chancellor, George Osborne, unwisely attached too much of his personal political capital to Hinkley. But even he should realise that this farce cannot be prolonged beyond May. Set a deadline and stick to it. William Hill suffers as customers set online betting limits Shocking news from world of bookmaking. No, not the confirmation that William Hill lost money on every day of the Cheltenham Festival. These things happen and the bookies shouldn\u2019t grumble, because their business would be smaller if the punters didn\u2019t enjoy a winning run once in a while. Instead, the revelation was within the other half of a profit warning that sent the share price down by 11%. It turns out that the Gambling Commission might not be quite the toothless watchdog we supposed. Online punters, it seems, are using the time out and automatic self-exclusion buttons that the commission insisted should be installed last year. William Hill reckons its online profits will be hit by \u00a320m-\u00a325m this year, which at the upper end would be almost a fifth of last year\u2019s online tally of \u00a3126m. Most of the self-excluders are banning themselves for the maximum three years and most had been playing casino games such as roulette. Give credit to the commission for a striking a small blow for gambling education. Its buttons may have underlined the message that fixed-odds games, where the house\u2019s long-term edge is mathematically certain, really aren\u2019t like horses, football or even poker. William Hill et al, once they have overcome the apparent shift in players\u2019 behaviour, should count their blessings. If parts of the commission\u2019s code of practice are seen to be effective, the heated public debate over \u201cresponsible gambling\u201d may cool by a degree. As for the commission, it shouldn\u2019t spend long congratulating itself. We\u2019re still sputtering over the Paddy Power case in which the bookie identified a gambling addict yet encouraged him to keep feeding its fixed-odds betting terminals. The commission solemnly declared that the chain was guilty of \u201cserious failings\u201d, but tickled Paddy Power with a \u00a3280,000 voluntary payment. A command to turn off the machines for a week would have sent a stiffer message. BHS takes another step on the long road back Hurrah, BHS is saved for a nation of grateful shoppers. Well, up to a point. The new owner, an outfit called Retail Acquisitions that bought the business from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 a year ago, has done well to secure the immediate future of BHS with the support of a thumping majority of creditors. There will now be steep cuts in rent on 87 of its 164 shops. But that arrangement only gets BHS back in the game. The next step is to secure \u00a3100m of funding. The process is advanced, but the terms of a \u00a360m loan from Gordon Brothers are unlikely to be generous. Then comes the much harder task of improving sales, reversing trading losses and earning the trust of understandably nervous suppliers. Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS, has declared that he wants to make the chain \u201can iconic British brand again\u201d. Full marks for ambition, but BHS, for a couple of decades, has been an icon of shoppers\u2019 boredom with such department stores. Does anybody miss C&amp;A? Topp\u2019s plan hinges on the ability to increase like-for-like sales by 1% in the second and third years of a three-year plan. It doesn\u2019t sound too difficult, but Marks &amp; Spencer hasn\u2019t produced annual growth in general merchandise in four years. Good luck.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI will start by saying clearly and categorically that Hinkley Point C will go ahead,\u201d declared Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, the UK end of the French state-owned company that is supposed to be building the \u00a318bn nuclear plant in Somerset.</p> <p>So that\u2019s a definite yes? Not exactly. It\u2019s a definite maybe because, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/23/edf-refuses-to-set-timetable-for-decision-on-hinkley-point-reactor\">de Rivaz was obliged to concede</a> in the next breath to MPs on the energy select committee, he cannot say when an investment decision will be made.</p> <p>That is because events are out of his and EDF\u2019s hands. Everything depends on the willingness of the French government to bail out an overindebted company that already faces the costly challenge of upgrading France\u2019s nuclear generating capacity. The French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/17/french-government-edf-united-front-hinkley-point-money-nuclear-plant-union\">floated the notion of supplying the funds</a> and making a final investment decision on Hinkley in early May, but it was unclear whether this \u201cdeadline\u201d has any greater force than the others that have come and gone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/14/hinkley-point-costly-mistake-france-britain-edf\">Hinkley Point is a costly mistake, but only France\u00a0can pull the plug | Simon Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Conservative MP James Heappey summed up the true state of affairs: \u201cIf the French government doesn\u2019t commit to that recapitalisation, you can\u2019t build us a power station because you\u2019ve not got the cash.\u201d De Rivaz, instead of agreeing with a plainly correct statement, descended into yet more bluster about how confident he remains. It was excruciating to watch.</p> <p>The best thing the UK government could do, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/07/finally-someone-at-edf-sees-the-18bn-farce-that-is-hinkley-point\">as argued here for ages</a>, is to call the whole thing off and write a better energy policy for the 2020s. EDF\u2019s European pressurised reactor model is unproven and the versions under construction in Finland and France are nine and six years behind schedule respectively. Not only this, but the cost of Hinkley is hideous for future UK consumers.</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne, unwisely attached <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/25/george-osborne-presses-on-with-hinkley-power-station-despite-criticism\">too much of his personal political capital</a> to Hinkley. But even he should realise that this farce cannot be prolonged beyond May. Set a deadline and stick to it.</p> <h2>William Hill suffers as customers set online betting limits</h2> <p>Shocking news from world of bookmaking. No, not the confirmation that William Hill lost money on every day of the Cheltenham Festival. These things happen and the bookies shouldn\u2019t grumble, because their business would be smaller if the punters didn\u2019t enjoy a winning run once in a while.</p> <p>Instead, the revelation was within the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/23/william-hill-issues-profit-warning-after-cheltenham-and-online-losses\">other half of a profit warning</a> that sent the share price down by 11%. It turns out that the Gambling Commission might not be quite the toothless watchdog we supposed. Online punters, it seems, are using the time out and automatic self-exclusion buttons that the commission insisted should be installed last year.</p> <p>William Hill reckons its online profits will be hit by \u00a320m-\u00a325m this year, which at the upper end would be almost a fifth of last year\u2019s online tally of \u00a3126m. Most of the self-excluders are banning themselves for the maximum three years and most had been playing casino games such as roulette.</p> <p>Give credit to the commission for a striking a small blow for gambling education. Its buttons may have underlined the message that fixed-odds games, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/18/gamble-away-everything-fixed-odds-betting-terminals\">house\u2019s long-term edge is mathematically certain</a>, really aren\u2019t like horses, football or even poker.</p> <p>William Hill et al, once they have overcome the apparent shift in players\u2019 behaviour, should count their blessings. If parts of the commission\u2019s code of practice are seen to be effective, the heated public debate over \u201cresponsible gambling\u201d may cool by a degree.</p> <p>As for the commission, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/02/gambling-commission-paddy-power-bookies-regulator-protecting-vulnerable\">it shouldn\u2019t spend long congratulating itself</a>. We\u2019re still sputtering over the Paddy Power case in which the bookie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/29/paddy-power-encouraged-gambler-lost-home-jobs-family-gambling-commission-report\">identified a gambling addict yet encouraged him</a> to keep feeding its fixed-odds betting terminals. The commission solemnly declared that the chain was guilty of \u201cserious failings\u201d, but tickled Paddy Power with a \u00a3280,000 voluntary payment. A command to turn off the machines for a week would have sent a stiffer message. </p> <h2>BHS takes another step on the long road back</h2> <p>Hurrah, BHS is saved for a nation of grateful shoppers. Well, up to a point. The new owner, an outfit called Retail Acquisitions that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/sir-philip-green-sells-off-lossmaking-bhs\">bought the business from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31</a> a year ago, has done well to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/23/bhs-creditors-approve-rescue-plan-company-voluntary-arrangement\">secure the immediate future of BHS</a> with the support of a thumping majority of creditors. There will now be steep cuts in rent on 87 of its 164 shops.<br></p> <p>But that arrangement only gets BHS back in the game. The next step is to secure \u00a3100m of funding. The process is advanced, but the terms of a \u00a360m loan from Gordon Brothers are unlikely to be generous. Then comes the much harder task of improving sales, reversing trading losses and earning the trust of understandably nervous suppliers.</p> <p>Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS, has declared that he wants to make the chain \u201can iconic British brand again\u201d. Full marks for ambition, but BHS, for a couple of decades, has been an icon of shoppers\u2019 boredom with such department stores. Does anybody miss C&amp;A?</p> <p>Topp\u2019s plan hinges on the ability to increase like-for-like sales by 1% in the second and third years of a three-year plan. It doesn\u2019t sound too difficult, but Marks &amp; Spencer hasn\u2019t produced annual growth in general merchandise in four years. Good luck.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson is hoping to bring back supersonic transatlantic passenger flights, and this time they will be \u201caffordable\u201d. Branson, who has already launched plans for $250,000-a-ticket flights into space, on Wednesday announced that his Virgin empire would help build a new generation of supersonic jets. Virgin has also signed an option to buy 10 of the planes to hopefully reintroduce 3.5-hour passenger flights between London and New York 13 years after Concorde was decommissioned. \u201cRichard has long expressed interest in developing high-speed flight and building high speed flight R&amp;D through Virgin Galactic and our manufacturing organization, The Spaceship Company,\u201d a Virgin Group spokeswoman said. \u201cWe can confirm that The Spaceship Company will provide engineering, design and manufacturing services, flight tests and operations and that we have an option on the first 10 airframes. It is still early days and just the start of what you\u2019ll hear about our shared ambitions and efforts.\u201d Branson is partnering with Blake Scholl, a pilot and former Amazon executive, who is building a prototype of the new jet, called Boom, in an aircraft hanger in Colorado. While several other companies, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, are developing new supersonic jets Scholl said his plan is likely to beat them to market as it does not require any new technology that would need approval by regulators. \u201cWe are talking about the first supersonic jet people can afford to fly,\u201d Scholl, the founder and chief executive of Boom, said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t science fiction, we are actually doing this. You will be able to fly New York to London in three-and-a-half hours for $5,000 return, [which is roughly] the same as [the cost] of business class.\u201d Scholl, 35, said his team of experienced aerospace engineers will build and test a prototype plane by the end of next year and commercial flights could begin with just a few years. As well as partnering with Virgin, Scholl said he has also signed a letter of intent with an major London-based airline, which wants to buy $2bn worth of his jets. Scholl said his plane will be able to succeed where Concorde ultimately failed because flights will be much cheaper so that, if they really wanted to, business executives could even commute across the Atlantic. \u201cConcorde was just too expensive to fly, and to fill 100 seats at $20,000 each,\u201d Scholl said. \u201cYou have to bring the ticket price down, and make the aeroplane the right size so you can fill the seats.\u201d Boom\u2019s plane will have 40 seats in two rows either side of the aisle, meaning that every passenger will get a direct view of the curvature of the earth as the plane cruises at 60,000ft, as well as direct access to the drinks trolley. \u201cWe are offering a service that\u2019s way faster, but for the cost of business,\u201d Scholl said. \u201cThere is a huge market out there, more than 20 million a year fly business class internationally. We can take them to Mach 2.2 (1,451mph, and faster than Concorde which flew at a top speed of Mach 2.04) and save them half their journey time.\u201d Scholl reckons there is so much demand for faster international travel that affordable supersonic flights could become a $100bn market. He said his plane could work on 500 different routes, but will concentrate initially on London to New York, San Francisco to Tokyo, and Los Angeles to Sydney. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and its equivalents in most countries, bans supersonic air travel overland. \u201cImagine departing from New York at 6am, and landing at Heathrow by 2.30pm London time,\u201d Scholl said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to make afternoon meetings, you can stay until 9.30pm have a full productive day, and and back in New York at 8pm [local time] so you can tuck your kids into bed. \u201cThe same thing works in the Pacific. San Francisco to Tokyo will take four and a half hours, you can leave in the morning have meetings, eat great sushi and be back in California before midnight on the day you left. This is not saving you an hour here or there, this lets you commute.\u201d Scholl is leading an 11-person team, including former Nasa, Lockheed Martin and Boeing engineers, constructing the plane in a hanger in Denver, Colorado. He said cheaper commercial supersonic travel is possible mainly due to advances in carbon fibre technology, which should enable his team to construct a plane that\u2019s 30% more fuel efficient than Concorde. When asked if his plans are really going to come to fruition, Scholl said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t science fiction. If I was telling you it was going to go Mach 4 [four times the speed of sound] \u2013 but, I\u2019m not. We\u2019re not using any technology that doesn\u2019t already exist, it is just putting it together in the right way. It will still be tested rigorously.\u201d Scholl concedes that he still needs much more funding to get even the prototype into the air. So far Boom has attracted just $2m of investment from mostly Silicon Valley billionaires, but he said he has more investors lined up when he needs to tap fresh funds. \u201cI started this because I was sad that I never got to fly on Concorde. I waited but no one was doing it, so I decided to,\u201d Scholl said. \u201cUltimately I want people to be able to get anywhere in the world in five hours for $100. To get there you have to improve fuel efficiency, but step-by-step supersonic air travel will become available for everyone. \u201cThis is supersonic passenger air travel, no bullshit, and it\u2019s actually affordable.\u201d",

The brothers, who also own the Daily Telegraph and a string of hotels including the Ritz in London, are understood to be looking at selling as much as a quarter of their interest in Shop Direct, which owns the Littlewoods and Very.co.uk online retailers. The deal could value Shop Direct at more than \u00a32bn according to Sky News, which first reported the potential sale. Sources told the Guardian that Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay had been in talks to sell a 25% stake in Shop Direct last year and were keen to capitalise on the business\u2019s return to profitability. Profits rose 78% to \u00a371.7m in the year to June 2015, its third consecutive year of profits after years of losses. The business is understood to be on track for another profits lift this year. \u201cThey are not going to sell the Telegraph or the hotels, those are both iconic businesses, but Shop Direct is not a long-term hold. The turnaround is pretty well done and they could get some value off the table,\u201d said one well-placed source. Selling a stake in Shop Direct would be a highly unusual move for the Barclays who own all of their businesses outright. Floating part of the business on the stock market could be a possibility, but City sources said such a move was unlikely given the Barclays\u2019 love of privacy. The company declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "As the long weekend approaches, stock markets had little inspiration to move in either direction so ended up virtually unchanged, with a couple of exceptions. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE close on Wednesday replicated the atmosphere on trading floors across Europe as London\u2019s leading index finished flat on the day. With little in the way of corporate news or economic data to guide them, most investors decided to stay away, possibly eager not to get left exposed ahead of the long Easter weekend. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 6.37 points or 0.1% Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.33% to 10,022.93 France\u2019s Cac dipped 0.18% to 4423.98 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.26% to 18,462.88 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.72% at 8927.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.29% to 551.31 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 33 points or 0.19% lower. Meanwhile with rising US crude inventories again, Brent is down 2.5% at $40.74 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The pound continued to come under pressure on growing uncertainty over the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union. A new poll showed the lead of the Remain campaign slipping, helping push sterling to a one month low against the euro and down more than a cent at $1.4094. The US currency was also supported by a number of hawkish comments from members of the Federal Reserve, who suggested rate rises were still on the cards - perhaps even in April - despite the current market volatility. Low oil prices have failed to give the global economy a lift and could cause serious problems, suggest IMF economists in a new blog post: Oil prices have been persistently low for well over a year and a half now, but as the April 2016 World Economic Outlook will document, the widely anticipated \u201cshot in the arm\u201d for the global economy has yet to materialize. We argue that, paradoxically, global benefits from low prices will likely appear only after prices have recovered somewhat and advanced economies have made more progress surmounting the current low interest rate environment.... Persistently low oil prices complicate the conduct of monetary policy, risking further inroads by unanchored inflation expectations. What is more, the current episode of historically low oil prices could ignite a variety of dislocations including corporate and sovereign defaults, dislocations that can feed back into already jittery financial markets. The possibility of such negative feedback loops makes demand support by the global community\u2013 along with a range of country-specific structural and financial-sector reforms\u2013all the more urgent. After the select committee meeting with EDF on a new nuclear plant at Hinckley Point, one of its MPs James Heappey has called on the French government to formally confirm the timetable for them to refinance the business. Heappey said: This morning\u2019s evidence session was hugely frustrating. EDF CEO Vincent de Rivaz opened by saying \u2018categorically\u2019 that Hinkley C would go ahead and seeming to confirm that a final investment decision would come in \u2018early May\u2019. But when pressed to confirm that date, he refused to do so. It is clear from his responses to our questions that despite EDF\u2019s undoubted commitment to Hinkley, the final decision on the project is entirely in the hands of President Hollande and the French Government. Whatever EDF might want to do, they just don\u2019t have the cash to do this unless the French Government agree to their re-capitalisation. EDF clearly expect this to be agreed by May but the UK Government must now seek further assurances from Paris that this timeline is realistic. Here is our report on the committee hearing: Crude prices, which have been supported by hopes that a meeting of producers next month can agree to freeze output to cope with the supply glut, have slipped back after new US inventory figures. US crude inventories rose by a much larger than forecast 9.4m barrels last week, more than three times higher than expected. Refineries cut output and imports jumped, adding to the crude stocks. But gasoline stocks fell by 4.6m barrels compared to expectations of a 1.5m decline. And crude stocks at the Cushing delivery hub in Oklahoma dropped by 1.26m barrels, the first fall in seven weeks. The news has helped send Brent crude down 2.5% to $40.73 a barrel. Over in the US , and new home sales rose 2% in February after a 7% fall in the previous month. But this was lower than the expected 3% rise, and sales fell in three of the main regions, with only the West seeing an increase, which took some of the gloss off the figures. February sales rose to an annual rate of 512,000 compared to 502,000 in the previous month. The January figure was revised upwards from 494,000. On Wall Street, markets have taken the data in their stride, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down just 20 points. Here\u2019s the opinion poll that is hitting sterling: The polling was taken last week, on 16 March. Sterling has just hit its lowest level against a basket of other currencies in more than two years. Thats\u2019s via Reuters, who are citing data from the Bank of England. Back to the other story of the morning... worries about the UK EU referendum. The pound is continuing to drop today, now down almost one cent against the US dollar at $1.4113. This latest weakness is triggered by a new telephone poll from Comres, just released, which shows the Remain campaign with 48% of support, and Leave on 41%. That\u2019s the narrowest lead since the general election of May 2015, according to Reuters. That follows the spike in sterling volatility we covered this morning, driven by new worries about Brexit. There\u2019s drama in the UK courts today Tom Hayes, the only person jailed in the UK for conspiring to rig the Libor rate, has been ordered to pay $1.25m, or \u00a3878k, after a \u2018proceeds of crime\u2019 hearing. It\u2019s likely that Hayes, and wife Sarah, will now be forced to sell their house in Surrey. Over at Westminster magistrates court, the alleged \u201cflash crash trader\u201d Navinder Singh Sarao has been told he can be extradited to the US. Sarao is accused of causing market turmoil on Wall Street in 2010, which briefly wiped 1,000 points off the Dow Jones industrial average. From court, Rob Davies has the details: District judge Quentin Purdy at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday ruled that Sarao\u2019s alleged actions constituted a crime in the UK. The ruling means Sarao, 37, can be sent to the US to answer 22 counts of wire fraud, commodities fraud and market manipulation carrying a maximum sentence of 380 years\u2019 imprisonment. Sarao\u2019s lawyer Richard Egan said: \u201cWe\u2019re very disappointed. We definitely will be appealing. We think we\u2019ve got a strong argument.\u201d Energy and climate change committee member James Heappey shares our view of today\u2019s hearing: Good news for fans of British Home Stores. The UK retailer has been rescued from closure, after its creditors voted in favour of the department store chain\u2019s survival plan. My colleague Graham Ruddick has the details: Landlords, suppliers and other creditors approved the 88-year-old retailer\u2019s company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure, at a vital meeting in a hotel in west London on Wednesday. The approval of the CVA secures the short-term future of BHS\u2019s 10,000 staff and 164 stores. However, the company still needs to restructure its pension scheme, which has a deficit of \u00a3571m and is likely to enter the Pension Protection Fund, and raise \u00a3100m so it can continue trading and fund a turnaround plan that includes modernising its shops and product range. The CVA involves landlords accepting sharp cuts to the rent on 87 of BHS\u2019s 164 shops. As many as 40 of these shops could close in the next few months if a deal on the size of the rent reduction cannot be reached with property owners. Greenpeace chief scientist Doug Parr, who pointed to flaws in the Hinkley C project this morning, has issued a statement heavily criticising the situation: \u201cThis morning the committee began to come to terms with the fact that the UK\u2019s energy policy has been annexed by EDF. It became very clear that Hinkley is dependant on the French state and the enthusiasm of the French and Chinese nuclear industries. This has distorted our national infrastructure planning, and has led to the UK government undermining our nascent but booming renewable energy businesses and scaring off investment. It is unconscionable that in reality the decisions pending about the future of our energy system and whether the UK meet our future carbon targets are in the hands of the French Economy Minister.\u201d What have we just learned about Britain\u2019s biggest nuclear power project in decades? 1) EDF are still committed. Despite the shock resignation of its CFO, and concerns over its own finances, France\u2019s energy company is still planning to build Britain a new nuclear power station at Hinkley. CEO Vincent de Rivaz insists that the controversial project is a good deal for all sides, and can be delivered. In a prepared statement, he said: I will start by saying, clearly and categorically, that Hinkley Point C will go ahead. That\u2019s good news for the UK. It has been a long road. The project has successfully passed a huge number of regulatory, commercial and operational milestones. EDF has already invested \u00a32.4bn, and is spending another \u00a355m per month. 2) But the project is in the French government\u2019s hands, rather than MPs in Westminster. De Rivaz consistently failed to commit to signing a final investment decision in May. Why? Because he\u2019s waiting for French ministers to agree a bailout for the company. Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, is effectively deciding whether Britain embarks on the Hinkley project. Conservative MP James Heappey summed the situation up, in this exchange. If the French government doesn\u2019t commit to that recapitalisation [of EDF], you can\u2019t build us a power station because you\u2019ve not got the cash. 3) Confidence isn\u2019t enough. The committee shone a light on the nuclear industry\u2019s black spots - plants are very difficult to build safely, and expensive to decommission afterwards. Committee chair Angus MacNeil pointed to other projects where executive confidence has been followed by problems on the ground. France\u2019s troubled Flamanville nuclear project loomed over today\u2019s session, given the problems with its reactor vessel. De Rivaz insisted that lessons have been learned, but that\u2019s easier to say than prove..... 4) The climax is looming. While uranium has a half-life of 4.468bn years, the Hinkley C drama could be intensifying in just a few weeks. If EDF doesn\u2019t sign on the dotted line to build Hinkley in early May, then the whole future of the project will be in serious doubt. That would please many campaigners - such as the three experts who told MPs this morning that Hinkley is a bad deal and best abandoned. But I suspect it would prove career-limiting for de Rivaz. Our environment editor Damian Carrington sums up today\u2019s hearing: The session ends with chairman Angus MacNeil saying the committee has heard EDF\u2019s confidence about Hinkley \u201cloud and clear.\u201d But they want to see action \u2013 a final investment decision on Hinkley by early May. So it that doesn\u2019t happen, and the Hinkley project isn\u2019t in the Queens speech on May 18, Vincent de Rivaz and colleagues could be hauled back to parliament to explain themselves. The committee turn to China\u2019s Taishan nuclear power station, which is using similar technology as Hinkey C. Q: When will Taishan be up and running? China General Nuclear\u2019s Zhu Minhong says it will definitely start operations in 2017. Q: So why is it moving so much faster than Hinkley? EDF\u2019s Humphrey Cadoux-Hudson says Taishan has benefitted from some of the lessons learned at France\u2019s Flamanville. The committee are concerned about problems at the Flamanville nuclear power plant in France - will they affect Hinkley? Humphrey Cadoux-Hudson, managing director for Nuclear New Build at EDF, says that engineers are already addressing concerns about Flamanville. Lessons can be learned for Hinkley. [Background: back in April, the French nuclear regulator discovered flawed steel in EDF\u2019s reactor in Flamanville] The Hinkley reactor pressure vessel is not made yet, so chances can be made if necessary, Cadoux-Hudson adds. Q: Has a power station similar to Hinkley C been build before? Cadoux-Hudson says not; Hinkley has taken lessons from Flamanville, and also from Japan\u2019s Fukushima. Labour\u2019s Matthew Pennycook MP isn\u2019t impressed with what he\u2019s hearing this morning. He tells the energy chiefs that: If this power station was fuelled on confidence and passion it would be up and running, but it\u2019s not. The committee ask Zhu Minhong of China General Nuclear, EDF\u2019s partner in the project, when he expects Hinkley to be signed off. Zhu explains that CGN are happy to be involved in Hinkley, concluding that: We are confident to say that this project will go ahead. Angus MacNeil, the committee chairman, nails it: Isn\u2019t the future of Hinkley Point C in the hands of the French government? De Rivaz says the project is in \u201cgood hands\u201d (sparking some tittering in the committee room). He argues that the French government should be closely involved, as he is EDF\u2019s major shareholder. Conservative MP James Heappey moves in for the kill. Heappey tells Vincent de Rivaz that he knows why EDF can\u2019t give a categorical pledge to make the final investment decision in early May. It\u2019s because the French government is set to decide in early May on whether to recapitalise EDF. Heappey says: If the French government doesn\u2019t commit to that recapitalisation, you can\u2019t build us a power station because you\u2019ve not got the cash. De Rivaz repeats that he is fully confidence that the project will go ahead. Heappey says it is \u201cextraordinary\u201d, given that confidence, that EDF won\u2019t commit to make the final investment decision in early May. It doesn\u2019t make sense to anyone, he adds. Here\u2019s our story about the possible recapitalisation of EDF: The committee are concerned about the cost of (eventually) decommissioning Hinkley Point C. Is enough money being put aside? De Rivaz says this cost is fully recognised in the contract -- it\u2019s \u201can example of us and the UK government behaving in a responsible way\u201d. But MPs point out that the cost of cleaning up previous projects, such as Windscale/Sellafield has been massively higher than expected. We\u2019re in as different world today, De Rivaz insists. \u201cWhat has been done badly in the past will not be done badly again\u201d Q: How much is Hinkley Point C actually going to cost? EDF say \u00a318bn, but other estimates say \u00a324.5bn De Rivaz says the construction cost is \u00a318bn. The larger figure comes from the European Union, and relates to another way by which the project could have been financed. Q: It\u2019s disappointing that you can\u2019t tell us more about the discussions with the French government about new financial support for EDF. Can you assure us that they won\u2019t be passed onto UK taxpayers in some way? De Rivaz says various options are being discussed, including: raising more capital, paying dividends in shares rather than cash selling non-core assets. None of them would impact the UK taxpayer, he promises. Q: Did EDF\u2019s chief finance officer resign over the Hinkley project? De Rivaz declines to comment on the reasons for Thomas Piquemal\u2019s shock resignation in early March. But he insists that the company\u2019s top executives support the project. Q: Your shares fell 6% when your CFO resigned; won\u2019t the impact be terrible if you don\u2019t meet the early May deadline? The project will go ahead, de Rivaz insists. De Rivaz insists that EDF is being responsible by sorting out its finances before making the \u2018final investment decision\u2019 on Hinkley. MPs don\u2019t seem too impressed, though. The energy and climate change committee want to know what\u2019s holding EDF back from a final decision on the Hinkley project. De Rivaz points says the fall in the oil price has put added strain on its finances, so it is in talks with the French government (its major shareholder) to finding a solution to these challenges. We are a great company, 70 years old, finding ways to tackle these challenges he continues. Q: Given EDF\u2019s confidence, when will it actually take the final investment decision to build Hinkley? It will be taken very soon, insists CEO Vincent de Rivaz. Q: When exactly? The French minister of economy and finance, Mr Macron, said early May. Q: If there is no decision by 15th May, the UK government and public should be worried? No-one should be worried about our commitment to a project in which we have spent more than \u00a32bn. Q: So, which day? I don\u2019t want to give a precise day, de Rivaz insists... We cannot be more commited and more confident than we are. But the committee remain unconvinced -- they want a firmer commitment, and are going to ink in 15 May are their own deadline. The committee question Vincent de Rivaz\u2019s claim that Hinkley Point C is a good deal for the British public. Q: We\u2019ve heard that Hinkley is only economically fair if oil was $230 per barrel [it\u2019s $40 today], so how can it be fair to customers? De Rivaz replies that the project is seen as too financially risky in France, and too expensive in the UK, so on balance it is probably fair. Greenpeace\u2019s Doug Parr (who testified earlier) isn\u2019t convinced. The EDF CEO also points out that his company are taking the risks to build the plant. UK consumers will pay nothing until electricity is produced in 2025, he adds. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz has declared that the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant will proceed, despite concerns about the project. He\u2019s reading a statement to the energy and climate change committee now, which begins I will start by saying, clearly and catagorically, that Hinkley Point C will go ahead. That\u2019s good news for the UK. It has been a long road. The project has successfully passed a huge number of regulatory, commercial and operational milestones. De Rivas says EDF has the expertise needed, and a team and supply chain set up to build Hinkley C \u201con time and on budget\u201d. He says that EDF is confident that the project will deliver the highest standards of safety, and has \u201cthe strong support of the UK and French governments\u201d. De Rivas also touches on those concerns about the price of the project, saying: We are confident and proud to be able to deliver this project, as it meets the UK\u2019s need for reliable, affordable, low-carbon electricity. It is a fair deal - fair for customers, fair for investors. A group of energy experts have told UK Parliament\u2019s energy and climate change committee today that the Hinkley Point C nuclear project is very bad value for money, and should be scrapped. The future of the new nuclear power plant was thrown into doubt last month when the finance chief of EDF, the state-controlled French energy company, resigned. And Simon Taylor, lecturer in finance at Cambridge University, said, the best hope for most people concerned is that the French government decides to \u201cpull the plug\u201d on the deal. It would preserve the rest of the nuclear options in the UK, as it would not cast any doubt on the UK\u2019s underlying commitment But if the UK cancels the project it could jeapodise all the other projects in the pipeline. Douglas Parr of Greenpeace told MPs that such a project could only be built by a huge slab of public money, and political will. Parr also heavily criticised the project, arguing that the cost of solar power and energy storage will both fall drastically in the next couple of decades, meaning Britain will be overpaying for Hinkley. Peter Atherton of investment bank Jefferies predicted that Hinkley should prove highly profitable to EDF, thanks to the contract agreed with the UK government. They\u2019ve got a great, great deal, if they can build it on time and on budget.....Once it\u2019s operational, that power station is going to be gold. The committee will hear from EDF shortly.... The chairman of Lloyds of London has warned that Brexit would hurt its business. John Nelson told Reuters this morning that: \u201cAbout 90 percent of our capital and business comes from outside the UK,\u201d \u201cIt would diminish our attraction as a market to invest in if we were not part of the EU.\u201d Lloyds is already finding conditions tougher - it posted a 30% drop in pre-tax profits this morning, partly due to record low interest rates cutting returns on its assets. Sports Direct has confirmed to the City this morning that its profits this year will be at the bottom end of the guidance issued in January. The announcement came a day after The Times published an interview with founder Mike Ashley, in which he warned: \u201cWe are in trouble, we are not trading very well. We can\u2019t make the same profit we made last year....\u201d That sent SPD\u2019s shares down 12% at one stage yesterday. They\u2019re down another 2% today. Boris Johnson, mayor of London, has begun testifying to the UK Treasury committee about the Eu referendum question. Boris, who supports Brexit, is fielding questions about \u201cthe economic and financial costs and benefits of the UK\u2019s EU membership\u201d. And he\u2019s begun by arguing that the City would not suffer if Britain left the EU. Our politics liveblogger, Andy Sparrow, says Boris\u2019s appearance is his toughest test yet, in the undeclared contest to succeed David Cameron as PM. Andy is tracking the action in his liveblog. Over in the City, shares in bookmaker William Hill have slumped by 13% after it warned that online profits are below forecasts. The company blamed unlucky results at Cheltenham last week - where it lost money every day. Good news for the punters. William Hill also admits that new rules allowing online gamblers to \u2018self-exclude\u2019 themselves from its services are hitting revenues, and could knock \u00a320m off profits. That suggests recent moves to help those with gambling problems are working. Here\u2019s another great chart from Jamie McGeever of Reuters, showing how demand for protection against a sterling crisis has soared: Several economists have predicted that the pound would slump against the US dollar if the Brexit campaign win, from $1.41 today to perhaps $1.2 or lower. Brexit concerns will be high on the agenda at the Bank of England today. The BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, which is charged with protecting financial stability, is holding its final meeting before the referendum. And the prospect of Britain voting to leaving the EU will be top of the agenda. Two weeks ago, governor Mark Carney told MPs that Brexit was the single biggest domestic risk to economic stability, so officials should be drawing up contingency plans to handle a Leave vote. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, told Bloomberg that the Bank of England will be worried about the impact on the City. \u201cWithout a doubt, Brexit is the top of everyone\u2019s agenda until June, and possibly after if we do vote to leave.\u201d \u201cThe FPC\u2019s mandate is the financial system, so they\u2019ll be looking at whether banks will be able to continue to do their business if there is a vote to leave. They may also talk about other risks to the financial sector, whether there would be an exodus of firms.\u201d City traders may also be reacting to the latest Referendum opinion poll, from ICM. It showed that the Leave campaign are leading by 43% to 41%, with 16% still undecided. The cost of insuring against a sharp fall in the pound is soaring this morning, in another sign of Brexit jitteriness. Three-month sterling volatility (which tracks contracts that protect against wild moves in the pound) has hit levels not seen since the last general election. That shows that investors are expecting a serious shake-up over the next quarter. Reuters has snapped the details: STERLING/DOLLAR THREE-MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY JUMPS TO 14.50 PCT, HIGHEST SINCE MID-2010 EURO/STERLING THREE-MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY ALSO JUMPS TO 13.70 PERCENT, HIGHEST SINCE APRIL 2009 In a sense, it\u2019s not a surprise that it\u2019s happening now - the referendum falls in exactly three month\u2019s time. But it also shows considerable uncertainty over the result, which could easily feed through to other parts of the economy. The pound is losing ground this morning, as concerns over Britain\u2019s upcoming EU referendum swirl through the City. Serling has extended yesterday\u2019s losses, and is down almost a half a cent since trading began in London, to $1.4168 against the US dollar. That wipes out most of its recent recovery, and sends it towards the six-year lows seen last month. Traders are citing the uncertainty over the June 23 referendum, and the possibility that the public could vote to break away from the EU. Yesterday\u2019s terrorist atrocities in Brussels could also be adding to Brexit concerns. But as Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale points out, there are other reasons to be bearish about sterling too. We are now exactly three months away from the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership and some \u2018Brexit\u2019 protagonists have chosen to use the atrocities in Brussels as a campaigning tool. The \u2018remain\u2019 campaign is based solely on warnings of how dreadful leaving would be, so the whole debate is thoroughly depressing. Meanwhile, slowing growth is hurting public finances, the Chancellor\u2019s spending cuts are in a mess and so it\u2019s no wonder the pound isn\u2019t flavour of the month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a pre-Easter feeling in the City this morning, as traders start to wind down for the long weekend. The market volatility of January and February is but a memory, as investors hunker down and ponder the state of the global economy. From Melbourne, IG\u2019s Chris Weston sums it up: What we are seeing at present is about as dull as one will see. As detailed yesterday, it could be the shortened week, but it feels like market players have entered the saloon and tumbleweeds are rolling down the street. So European markets are likely to be eerily calm. The economic calendar is disappointingly threadbare this morning too, although we do get the latest US oil reserves count this afternoon. But there\u2019s a flurry of corporate news around this morning. Lloyds of London, retail chains Kingfisher and Game Digital, bookmaker William Hill, and furnishings group Laura Ashley are all issuing results. That might shake things up in the Square Mile. And Swiss bank Credit Suisse has already announced 2,000 job cuts, as part of a restructuring plan: We\u2019ll be tracking the main events (such as we can find) through the day.....",

    "webTitle": "BHS chief asks public for second chance as retailer wins crucial vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of BHS has asked for the British public to give the struggling department store a \u201csecond chance\u201d after it won a stay of execution thanks to creditors voting in favour of a survival plan. More than 95% of landlords, suppliers and other creditors backed the 88-year-old retailer\u2019s company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure, at a vital meeting at a hotel in west London on Wednesday. The approval of the CVA secures the short-term future of BHS\u2019s 10,000 staff. However, the company still needs to restructure its pension scheme, which has a deficit of \u00a3571m and is likely to enter the Pension Protection Fund, and raise \u00a3100m so it can continue trading and fund a turnaround plan that includes modernising its shops and product range. Darren Topp, chief executive of BHS, said: \u201cWe are delighted that we have the support of landlords and creditors. But we are under no illusions. This is the start. Me and my team now have to roll our sleeves up. \u201cWe want to make it an iconic British brand again. There will be no popping champagne corks tonight. We would like the British public to give us a second chance. Come and see our stores and you will be surprised.\u201d The CVA involves landlords accepting sharp cuts to the rent on 87 of BHS\u2019s 164 shops. Up to 40 of these shops could close in the next few months if a deal on the size of the rent reduction cannot be reached with property owners. BHS had warned it would fall into administration if the CVA was rejected and it was not able to reduce its rent bill. Three-quarters of creditors at the meeting needed to vote in favour of the CVA for it to be approved. At the creditor meeting, Topp outlined his turnaround plan. He said BHS saw its core customer as \u201cpurposeful mums\u201d. He plans to reduce the number of in-house brands at BHS, introduce a premium range, upgrade the retailer\u2019s website, and install food departments into its shops. Trading in autumn and winter was worse than expected, Topp said, which brought forward the need for a CVA. Topp confirmed that BHS was in talks with the PPF about the retailer\u2019s pension scheme entering the state-backed lifeboat. The PPF abstained in the vote, despite being BHS\u2019s biggest creditor. Dominic Chandler, the legal director of BHS, also said the company was in the final stages of agreeing a \u00a360m loan with Gordon Brothers as part of the \u00a3100m of new funding it was trying to raise. BHS is also close to striking a deal on its shop in Oxford Street in London that is likely to see other retailers take space in the property and could raise another \u00a330m. Creditors gave a mixed reaction to the CVA and BHS\u2019s plan. Tony Hyams, an insolvency practitioner representing Kone, which makes escalators and lifts, said: \u201cIt gives the creditors a chance to get their money back. It\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d Another creditor, who asked not to be one named, said he was representing nine different funds that had voted for and against the CVA. He said: \u201cThere is a turnaround solution and it has got a chance of being successful. But we want more details on the pension fund.\u201d However, a major clothing supplier said they it was concerned about BHS\u2019s plan to cut the letters of credit it issues. This move will free up to \u00a310m of cash for BHS, but remove protection for suppliers, who are struggling to get credit insurance on deals with the loss-making chain. Charles Cruxon at Courtaulds, a clothing manufacturer, said: \u201cWe are concerned about the long-term ability of BHS to pay for orders. I think voting in favour was the best option, but we still have concerns as to where we are at this time. I am hopeful they will survive and move forward with their plan.\u201d He said he would seek a meeting with BHS management. The PPF warned that BHS could still collapse if it did not agree a deal over its pension. Malcolm Weir, head of restructuring and insolvency at PPF, said: \u201cThe CVA for BHS has been agreed, however this does not mean the pension schemes\u2019 deficits have been resolved. \u201cThe PPF will be working with the company over the coming months to find a solution. However failure to reach a compromise may still result in insolvency. Members of the pension schemes continue to be protected.\u201d BHS is owned by Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known financiers, lawyers and accountants who bought the department store chain from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 last year. British Home Stores, as it was originally known, was founded in Brixton, south London, in 1928 by a group of American entrepreneurs who wanted to create a UK version of Woolworths. Green bought the business for \u00a3200m in 2000, eventually making it part of his retail empire Arcadia. He took about \u00a3400m out of BHS in dividends between 2000 and 2004. The PPF could force Green to pump funds into the pension scheme. It has been reported that the billionaire tycoon has offered \u00a380m, including \u00a340m in cash and a \u00a340m loan against BHS assets, to the pension scheme. Concerns about the future of BHS have grown since it was taken over by Retail Acquisitions. Dominic Chappell, the man who led the consortium, has been declared bankrupt twice. The Guardian revealed this month that Retail Acquisitions took an \u00a38.4m loan out of BHS in the days after buying the retailer in March 2015. More than a third of the loan went to four directors of Retail Acquisitions, including Chappell. Retail Acquisitions said the loan was for \u201cprofessional fees\u201d. Chandler addressed the loan at the CVA meeting. He said that only \u00a3500,000 of it had come from BHS Limited, the subsidiary that is part of the CVA, and it had now been paid down to \u00a36.9m. He also confirmed that BHS had a \u201cmanagement services\u201d agreement with Retail Acquisitions that involves the retailer paying fees to its owners. This agreement has been benchmarked against rivals, he said. Speaking after meeting, suppliers expressed their support for the owners. Cruxon at Courtaulds said there was \u201ca significant amount of backing\u201d going into BHS, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any choice really.\u201d Topp, the BHS boss, said: \u201cThey are a force for good, they bring different business experience.\u201d Fewer than 300 people attended the meeting. They asked questions about the company\u2019s financial forecasts, the progress of its attempts to raise \u00a3100m, and the prospect of BHS regaining credit insurance, which allows suppliers to protect themselves against the business going bust. BHS revealed thats its financial plans are based on the business growing like-for-like sales by 1% in years two and three of a new three-year plan. Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, which represents landlords, said: \u201cWhile the CVA will help alleviate some of the short-term pressures on the company, it is imperative that the owners of the company now raise capital to reinvigorate it. \u201cWhat we value most with CVAs is open and transparent dealings, so that landlords know exactly the parameters within which they are working. In this case, KPMG [BHS\u2019s advisers] started the engagement process with landlords early, which we welcome.\u201d",

But we are under no illusions. This is the start. Me and my team now have to roll our sleeves up. </p> <p>\u201cWe want to make it an iconic British brand again. There will be no popping champagne corks tonight. We would like the British public to give us a second chance. Come and see our stores and you will be surprised.\u201d</p> <p>The CVA involves landlords accepting sharp cuts to the rent on 87 of BHS\u2019s 164 shops. Up to 40 of these shops could close in the next few months if a deal on the size of the rent reduction cannot be reached with property owners.</p> <p>BHS had warned it would fall into administration if the CVA was rejected and it was not able to reduce its rent bill. Three-quarters of creditors at the meeting needed to vote in favour of the CVA for it to be approved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8e5c1d2542a0490fed37b94c84be01f5edaaccc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8e5c1d2542a0490fed37b94c84be01f5edaaccc/0_275_2008_1204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Green, who bought the business for \u00a3200m in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Green, who bought the business for \u00a3200m in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the creditor meeting, Topp outlined his turnaround plan. He said BHS saw its core customer as \u201cpurposeful mums\u201d. He plans to reduce the number of in-house brands at BHS, introduce a premium range, upgrade the retailer\u2019s website, and install food departments into its shops.</p> <p>Trading in autumn and winter was worse than expected, Topp said, which brought forward the need for a CVA.</p> <p>Topp confirmed that BHS was in talks with the PPF about the retailer\u2019s pension scheme entering the state-backed lifeboat. The PPF abstained in the vote, despite being BHS\u2019s biggest creditor.</p> <p>Dominic Chandler, the legal director of BHS, also said the company was in the final stages of agreeing a \u00a360m loan with Gordon Brothers as part of the \u00a3100m of new funding it was trying to raise. BHS is also close to striking a deal on its shop in Oxford Street in London that is likely to see other retailers take space in the property and could raise another \u00a330m.</p> <p>Creditors gave a mixed reaction to the CVA and BHS\u2019s plan. Tony Hyams, an insolvency practitioner representing Kone, which makes escalators and lifts, said: \u201cIt gives the creditors a chance to get their money back. It\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d</p> <p>Another creditor, who asked not to be one named, said he was representing nine different funds that had voted for and against the CVA. He said: \u201cThere is a turnaround solution and it has got a chance of being successful. But we want more details on the pension fund.\u201d</p> <p>However, a major clothing supplier said they it was concerned about BHS\u2019s plan to cut the letters of credit it issues. This move will free up to \u00a310m of cash for BHS, but remove protection for suppliers, who are struggling to get credit insurance on deals with the loss-making chain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e80797b035dba409ac8e3d8a10b6a3d8ff0b3565\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e80797b035dba409ac8e3d8a10b6a3d8ff0b3565/152_46_2724_1635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A branch of British Home Stores, as the retailer was known, in 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A branch of British Home Stores, as the retailer was known, in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Associated Newspapers/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charles Cruxon at Courtaulds, a clothing manufacturer, said: \u201cWe are concerned about the long-term ability of BHS to pay for orders. I think voting in favour was the best option, but we still have concerns as to where we are at this time. I am hopeful they will survive and move forward with their plan.\u201d He said he would seek a meeting with BHS management.</p> <p>The PPF warned that BHS could still collapse if it did not agree a deal over its pension. Malcolm Weir, head of restructuring and insolvency at PPF, said: \u201cThe CVA for BHS has been agreed, however this does not mean the pension schemes\u2019 deficits have been resolved.</p> <p>\u201cThe PPF will be working with the company over the coming months to find a solution. However failure to reach a compromise may still result in insolvency. Members of the pension schemes continue to be protected.\u201d</p> <ol> BHS is owned by Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/sir-philip-green-sells-off-lossmaking-bhs\">little-known financiers, lawyers and accountants</a> who bought the department store chain from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 last year. <br> </ol> <p>British Home Stores, as it was originally known, was founded in Brixton, south London, in 1928 by a group of American entrepreneurs who wanted to create a UK version of Woolworths.</p> <p>Green bought the business for \u00a3200m in 2000, eventually making it part of his retail empire Arcadia. He took about \u00a3400m out of BHS in dividends between 2000 and 2004. The PPF could force Green to pump funds into the pension scheme.

    "webTitle": "Lloyd's boss says manmade risks are bigger threats than natural disasters", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London has warned that manmade risks such as terrorism, cyber-attacks and climate change had become bigger threats than natural disasters. Inga Beale\u2019s comments came as the 328-year-old institution posted a 30% fall in 2015 profits, hit by a sharp decline in investment returns in the wake of ultra-low interest rates, as well as price declines amid rising competition. Beale said: \u201cIn the traditional days of insurance we used to be very concerned about earthquakes and hurricanes ... These days manmade risks are becoming the predominant risks.\u201d These include growing demand for terrorism insurance from local city governments and businesses. She pointed to the Lloyd\u2019s city risk index, which found that nearly half the economic risks faced by 301 cities around the world were linked to manmade threats, including market crashes, cyber-attacks, power outages and nuclear accidents. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in manmade risks all over the world,\u201d she added. Beale said Lloyd\u2019s, which underwrites complex risks through its 97 syndicates of insurers, including cover for businesses and airports, was likely to face some claims in relation to this week\u2019s Brussels attacks and other recent terrorist incidents. But despite the increase in terrorism there are relatively few claims and they are unlikely to result in substantial insurance losses. Climate change is another major threat, which affects some areas of the world that \u201cdon\u2019t really know about insurance\u201d, Beale said, such as the Philippines which suffered severe floods last autumn. Eight Lloyd\u2019s syndicates including Amlin, Beazley and Hiscox launched a $400m initiative in November to work with governments to tackle under-insurance in developing economies. Pretax profits at Lloyd\u2019s fell from \u00a33bn in 2014 to \u00a32.1bn in 2015, its worst year since 2011 when record claims for natural disasters pushed the market into the red. Investment returns more than halved to \u00a3400m from \u00a31bn and underwriting income fell to \u00a32bn from \u00a32.3bn. The biggest losses were caused by the Tianjin warehouse explosion in China and a fire at a platform run by Mexican oil company Pemex. Lloyd\u2019s chairman John Nelson said: \u201cIn a market undeniably tougher than seen for many years, we have had to demonstrate our ability to adapt and take action.\u201d Beale also reiterated that Britain was better off staying in the EU. She noted that the EU had trade agreements with 50 other markets and was in the process of agreeing a major deal with the US, TTIP. \u201cFor us, the benefit of being in the EU is enormous,\u201d she said. She said that a vote to leave would be a major blow to the insurance industry, which is highly regulated and would need to deal with regulators in individual countries. Lloyd\u2019s has been pushing into emerging markets such as Latin America and China, where it now has more than 30 syndicates after opening a branch in Beijing a year ago. The group invests the money collected in insurance premiums but gains have been eroded by low interest rates. Beale predicted that 2016 would be just as tough at 2015, with interest rates set to stay low. Lloyd\u2019s made a 9.1% return on capital, down from 14.1% in 2014. It collected gross premiums of \u00a326.7bn, up 6%. The group\u2019s annual report showed that Beale received a pay and bonus package of \u00a31.53m last year, up slightly from \u00a31.49m in 2014. For 2016, she has received a salary increase of 2%, her first rise since joining Lloyd\u2019s in January 2014.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in the owner of food brands including Mr Kipling, Batchelors and Ambrosia have surged after it turned down two takeover approaches from US food group McCormick and struck a cooperation agreement with Japan\u2019s Nissin Foods. Premier Foods\u2019 share price jumped more than 70% to 53.75p by the close of trading after the British company said it had rejected two unsolicited bids from McCormick, known for Schwartz dried spices and sauces. The US company initially offered to pay 52p a share in cash in mid-February, and raised this to 60p on 14 March. But Premier\u2019s board was unanimous in deciding that this was still too low. David Beever, the chairman, said: \u201cThe proposal fails to recognise the value of Premier\u2019s performance to date and prospects for the future, including the strategic plans we have to accelerate growth.\u201d The company told shareholders that while the offer was significantly above the current share price, it did not reflect Premier\u2019s enterprise value which includes allowances for debt and pension obligations. Premier also does not believe that the offer price \u201cfairly reflects the company\u2019s growth prospects\u201d. McCormick has until 20 April to table a firm offer. Investec analyst Nicola Mallard said: \u201cIn order to \u2018absorb\u2019 Premier\u2019s financial obstacles, any bidder had to be bigger and McCormick seems to fit the bill, with a portfolio which shares some similarities with Premier\u2019s grocery division. We are, however, less convinced of the Nissin factor. We share the board\u2019s view though that a bid ought to reflect the value of the underlying business rather than take advantage of the financial predicament which dominates the stock price.\u201d Premier, which is trying to turn itself around after sales declines and a debt splurge, said investment in new products and packaging formats was starting to pay off and that it was gaining market share, as it unveiled its Nissin agreement. Nissin invented instant noodles in 1958 and operates in 19 countries. Its products include Cup Noodles, Soba and Top Ramen. The deal will give Premier access to Nissin\u2019s products to distribute them in the UK under either Nissin\u2019s or Premier\u2019s brands, such as Batchelors, while speeding up the distribution of its products around the world. Premier is considering whether to allow Nissin to appoint a non-executive director to the board if the latter acquires a 15% plus stake. The Japanese company has confirmed that it does not intend to make a takeover offer for at least six months and would not be allowed to do so except in certain circumstances. Premier\u2019s chief executive, Gavin Darby, said: \u201cThis is an exceptional opportunity for us to gain a major strategic partner which understands our business and supports our growth ambitions.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tom Hayes, the former star trader serving an 11-year jail sentence for manipulating Libor interest rates, has been ordered to pay \u00a3878,806 after a court ruled the money was the proceeds of crime. The Serious Fraud Office was seeking up to \u00a32.45m from Hayes, which he was paid in bonuses while he rigged the key rate at which banks lend to each other. Justice Cooke decided that 35% of Hayes\u2019s bonuses came from manipulating Libor. Hayes\u2019s main asset is a \u00a31.7m country house, which he bought with his wife, Sarah Tighe, in 2011. Hayes sold his half of the seven-bedroom property to Tighe in 2013 for \u00a3600,000, less than its value, and the court decided this was a \u201ctainted gift\u201d that should be available for confiscation. At last week\u2019s five-day confiscation hearing at the Old Bailey, the SFO claimed Hayes\u2019s total benefit from his criminal behaviour was \u00a33.8m. Cooke, who also presided over Hayes\u2019s criminal trial, decided the available amount was \u00a31.76m. The judge included a \u00a34,000 Rolex Daytona watch, Tighe\u2019s \u00a38,899 engagement ring and \u00a3190 wedding ring, a Mercedes car worth almost \u00a313,000 and \u00a332,280 in a bank account. Cooke concluded Hayes would not have been as highly regarded as he was by his employers, the investment banks UBS and Citi, if he had not successfully manipulated Libor. The measure, whose full name is the London interbank offered rate, is used to set an estimated $300tn (\u00a3212tn) of financial contracts around the world. Hayes was convicted in August of eight counts of fraud for conspiring to fix Libor by using contacts at other banks and brokers to get daily rates reported in his favour. His sentence was cut from 14 years on appeal in December. Cooke said Hayes would face an extra three years in prison if he did not hand over the money within three months, though he was given some leeway to sell the house. The Old Rectory in Woldingham, Surrey, is up for sale and the tenants have until the end of July to leave, the SFO said. At Hayes\u2019s trial, the SFO portrayed him as the ringleader of an international conspiracy to rig Libor, which was calculated by banks reporting their own borrowing costs each day to the British Bankers\u2019 Association. In January, six brokers were found not guilty of helping Hayes and accused the SFO of scapegoating them. The SFO said the cost of Hayes\u2019s confiscation hearing was not yet available but Mark Thompson, head of the agency\u2019s proceeds of crime division, said the payout was significant despite falling well short of the amount it had sought. He said: \u201cThe court acknowledged the challenges of quantifying the benefit from crime in this case. The SFO provided the court with all the available information and the outcome is a substantial confiscation order, which Mr Hayes will need to satisfy or face a further period of imprisonment.\u201d Hayes, who received legal aid for the confiscation trial, may also have to pay the SFO\u2019s costs for the confiscation hearing. In a statement from HMP Belmarsh, Hayes said: \u201cThe Serious Fraud Office has tried to take everything from me \u2013 from my liberty to my wedding ring.\u201d \u201cI vehemently maintain my innocence,\u201d he added. \u201cThe practices for which I have been imprisoned were industry standard practice and had been for 20 years. I have every intention of telling the general public the truth about Libor and will do so at the earliest possible opportunity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Recovery from the deepest recession in Britain\u2019s post-war history has left Britons healthier, better off, less likely to be victims of crime and living greener lives, according to the latest official snapshot of national wellbeing. Life expectancy and living standards rose while unemployment fell during a three-year period from 2012-14, a time when the UK finally shrugged off the after effects of the financial crisis that began in 2007. The Office for National Statistics said its fourth report on national wellbeing had shown that there had been improvements in 17 of its measures, a deterioration in eight and no change in 11. Areas of life which the survey showed as improving included personal finances and the economy, with real median household income and net national disposable income both rising and joblessness going down. There was a a fall in the proportion finding it difficult to get by, which the ONS said was a sign that Britons were less worried about their finances. Healthy life expectancy continued, although at the same time satisfaction with health fell sharply from 66.3% to 57.8%. \u201cThe majority of improvements relate to objective measures of national wellbeing such as the unemployment rate, while the majority of measures assessed as deteriorated are subjective measures, such as satisfaction with health,\u201d the ONS said. It added that between 2012 and 2014 crimes against the person dropped by a third, from 82 per 1,000 adults to 57 per 1,000 adults in the financial year ending 2015. Net national disposable income per head rose modestly from \u00a322,487 to \u00a322,786 and the proportion finding it difficult to cope financially fell from 11.6% to 9.1%. More energy was produced from renewable sources, but at 7% was less than halfway towards the government\u2019s target of 15% by 2020. Waste recycling rates increased slightly to just under 45%, closing in on the EU target of 50% by 2020. Between 2011 and 2014, greenhouse gas emissions fell from 553.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent to 514.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. But the ONS said not all areas of life in the UK were getting better, adding that the proportions satisfied with accommodation, household income and leisure time had all fallen over the three-year period. Mental wellbeing scores also fell over the period as did the proportion who had a spouse or partner, family member or friend to rely on if they had a serious problem. Adult participation in sport has also fallen. The latest data showed few changes in children\u2019s overall wellbeing, with children reporting relatively high levels of personal wellbeing and positive relationships with parents. \u201cHowever, there are still areas of concern, such as the proportion of children who report being bullied frequently and the proportion of children reporting symptoms of mental ill-health.\u201d The ONS study also looked at whether the UK had a sustainable future. \u201cLooking at national stocks of things such as education, skills and competencies in the labour market (human capital) and the value of natural resources such as woodlands and rivers (natural capital), there is a mixed message about sustainability for the future. Human capital rose between 2013 and 2014, but remains below levels seen before the financial crisis and latest data for natural capital shows long term decline.\u201d",

Sainsbury\u2019s is up 2.6p at 282.6p, but Tesco is heading in the other direction, down 2.8p to 198.85p as analysts at Stifel cut their recommendation from hold to sell with a 167p price target. The broker said investors could be overestimating how quickly Tesco\u2019s improvement will produce results, and also pointed out that Amazon\u2019s expansion in online groceries was likely to put pressure on the whole sector. It said: We think Tesco is executing far better in UK stores, with a significantly improved value proposition, and that this is likely to sustain the recent improvement in trading. However, we think the market has become too optimistic about how quickly this might translate into meaningful profit improvement. Tesco trades on a near 6% 2018 estimated free cash flow yield on estimates incorporating a healthy UK margin recovery, while Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s both trade on around 7% on expectations that assume margins move sideways. Valuing Tesco on a 7% free cash flow yield, consistent with our valuation for the rest of the sector, determines our target price of 167p, downside of 17%. We appreciate the potential for Tesco\u2019s UK intake margin to improve as supplier relationships normalise and see further benefit from range rationalisation and volume growth. However, we think ongoing structural pressures will make management inclined to continue to reinvest gross margin gains back into the proposition for some time, at the very least limiting the visibility of future margin improvement. Moreover, we are not believers in the idea that Tesco\u2019s relative scale should deliver a material margin advantage versus competitors... The main drivers to date of improved like for like growth for the Big 3 quoted grocers have been reduced net new space growth and Asda\u2019s market share losses, neither of which are likely to be continued sources of growth. Also, far from being optimistic about the potential return of inflation to UK grocery, we think there is a very real risk of it driving renewed gross margin pressure as retailers seek to gain volume by not passing through higher input costs. Even if some inflation does creep through, we think volume growth will likely fall to offset this benefit. Tesco also has the most to lose if, as we expect, Amazon puts online grocery profitability under pressure.",

      "bodyText": "Dire horse racing results at the Cheltenham festival and high-value internet gamblers imposing restrictions on their own betting have triggered a profit warning for bookmaker William Hill. In a surprise trading update on Wednesday, the bookmaker said it expected operating profit for this year to fall to between \u00a3260m and \u00a3280m, from \u00a3291m last year. Analysts\u2019 average forecast was for profit of \u00a3307m from a range of \u00a3284m-318m. William Hill shares fell 11% to 329p and were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 350 group of leading shares after a second profit warning in five months. Shares in rival bookmaker Ladbrokes fell more than 2%. James Henderson, William Hill\u2019s chief executive, said the worst Cheltenham in living memory and unfavourable European football results meant online revenues were about \u00a315m worse than expected with almost three months of the year gone. Customers choosing to opt out of gambling online will cut online profits by up to \u00a325m this year, he added. Bookmakers said last week\u2019s Cheltenham was the worst ever for them as three out of four favourites in championship races won and the second-favourite won the fourth. Overall, nine favourites and one joint favourite won in the 28 races over four days. Henderson apologised to analysts for publishing a trading statement so soon after the company\u2019s results on 26 February. He said: \u201cEvents have moved at a pace and we have seen two issues come together in accelerated fashion and I felt it was appropriate to provide an update. I can\u2019t remember having four loss-making days at Cheltenham in my career.\u201d Investors were more concerned by a jump in customers opting out of gambling than the short-term pain caused by Cheltenham. The rapid rise had City analysts clicking on William Hill\u2019s website to learn how the opt-out system functions. Under rules introduced by the Gambling Commission in October to combat problem gambling, online customers can tell a bookmaker they want to take between 24 hours and six months off from gambling while keeping their account open. They can also close their account for between six months and five years by ticking a box online instead of calling the bookmaker as before. Customer \u201ctime outs\u201d on their gambling have increased by 50% from the start of this year, affecting 3,000 accounts a week at a cost of \u00a32m so far. Customers \u201cself excluding\u201d have doubled and those customers had typically spent three or four times the average, Henderson said. Paul Hope, the Gambling Commission\u2019s Consumer consumer policy director, said: \u201cWe expect operators to put social responsibility at the heart of their business. Recent changes we\u2019ve made to our regulations have provided consumers with more effective tools to manage their gambling. It is up to consumers to decide how best to use them.\u201d Henderson said opting out was on the rise across the industry but William Hill was affected heavily because it is the UK\u2019s biggest online operator with higher spending customers. Henderson said the Cheltenham results and the rise in opt-outs would not probably not have prompted a profit warning on in isolation but the combined impact meant \u201cit was appropriate to go to the market\u201d. He said: \u201cThe opportunity to put the tools in people\u2019s hands is to make it an automated process and perhaps this has prompted people to do it a bit more than recently.\u201d From next year, gamblers will be able to exclude themselves from all online bookmakers in one move instead of doing so with individual companies, potentially putting further pressure on the bookies. Henderson said: \u201cOne of the analysts asked me: \u2018What are you forecasting for 2017?\u2019 but it\u2019s almost impossible to forecast what is going to happen in the future. All we can do is update the market.\u201d William Hill\u2019s shock update followed an earlier warning in October when it said a string of favourites winning horse races had affected results. Last month the company mainly blamed new gambling taxes for a 22% fall in operating profit from \u00a3372m a year in 2014. The betting industry has been under attack from MPs and campaigners over its reliance on compulsive fixed-odds betting terminals in branches, often in poor parts of the country. The government introduced a point of consumption tax in December 2014 and increased the duty on machine games from 20% to 25%.",

      "bodyText": "B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher has sent a team to Australia to check out rival Bunnings as it admits it faces tougher competition from the new owner of Homebase. Unveiling a better than expected 0.3% rise in underlying profit to \u00a3686m on Wednesday, chief executive, V\u00e9ronique Laury said: \u201cThere is no question that Bunnings will be a strong competitor in the UK. We are following their plans closely.\u201d Bunnings is expected to cut prices and attract more professional builders and decorators after buying Homebase from Home Retail Group for \u00a3340m. It wants to convert the whole Homebase chain to the Bunnings name in the medium term. Laury said she was \u201cvery respectful\u201d of the incomer but said Bunnings would have \u201cwork to do. Homebase is very different to Bunnings.\u201d Kingfisher also has a heavy workload with a plan to close 60 B&amp;Q stores while it opens nearly 150 more Screwfix outlets in the coming years. Underlying profits at the group, which also owns Castorama in France and chains in Russia and Poland, rose 0.3% to \u00a3686m in the 12 months to the end of January. Total sales measured in constant currencies rose 3.8% to \u00a310.3bn boosted by a 1.9% rise at established B&amp;Q stores and 15.3% lift at Screwfix stores open more than a year. The better than expected performance boosted Kingfisher\u2019s share price by more than 3% to 362p, making it the highest riser in the FTSE 100 in early trading. However, when currency exchange rate issues and a net \u00a3166m of exceptional costs, mainly from the closure of 30 B&amp;Q stores over the year, were taken into account, headline profits slumped by 20.5% to \u00a3512m. The fall was partly offset by a \u00a3143m windfall from the sale of a 70% stake in B&amp;Q\u2019s loss-making Chinese operation. The company said it was now selling the final 30%, subject to regulatory approval in China, for \u00a360m. Laury, said: \u201cWe have delivered a good \u2018business as usual\u2019 result with both sales and profit growth in constant currencies, driven by our performance in Poland and the UK, driven largely by Screwfix, and a stable performance in France. \u201cIn the short term, the fundamentals of the UK economic backdrop remain positive, although we remain cautious on the outlook for France. The outlook for the wider global economy remains uncertain, and the impact of the outcome of the UK EU referendum is unknown.\u201d Laury\u2019s home country of France was the worst performing part of the Kingfisher empire with underlying sales down 0.4% and profits down 1.6% in constant currencies. The company, which owns the Castorama and Brico Depot chains, blamed \u201congoing weak consumer confidence and subdued housing and construction activity\u201d. Screwfix has nine stores in Germany and is planning to open another nine. It currently has 457 stores in the UK and wants to take that to 600 over time. The chain, which caters to professional builders rather than home owners, is far outperforming the group\u2019s traditional DIY chains. In January, the owner of B&amp;Q and Castorama in France unveiled a plan to boost profits by \u00a3500m a year and return \u00a3600m to shareholders.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has been forced to clarify its profit expectations for the year after its founder, Mike Ashley, admitted in a newspaper interview that the retailer was \u201cnot trading very well\u201d. In a statement to the stock exchange on Wednesday morning, Sports Direct said it expected annual earnings to be near the bottom of the \u00a3380m to \u00a3420m range it published when it blamed warm weather for poor trading over Christmas. The company\u2019s announcement followed what appeared to be a further profit warning by Ashley on Tuesday. He told the Times that scrutiny of his company\u2019s practices was damaging its sales at the expense of profit. In its last financial year, the group made \u00a3383.2m of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The City interpreted Ashley\u2019s comments as the latest in a series of profit warnings, despite no formal statement being made to the stock exchange. The statement on Wednesday guided investors towards the lower end of the previously announced range, suggesting performance was indeed worse than the average analysts forecast. Ashley told the Times: \u201cWe are in trouble, we are not trading very well. We can\u2019t make the same profit we made last year. We are supposed to be taking the profits up, they are not supposed to be coming down, and the more the media frenzy feeds on it, the more it affects us.\u201d Sports Direct shares, which have more than halved since August, tumbled by more than 10% on Tuesday after Ashley\u2019s comments. The shares fell again on Wednesday, dropping by more than 4% to 310p by late morning. The company\u2019s statement on Wednesday said: \u201cIn the light of recent press coverage, Sports Direct wishes to clarify that its current expectations for adjusted underlying Ebitda (before share scheme costs) for the full year to the end of April 2016 are at or around the bottom of the range announced on 8 January 2016.\u201d The company, which was the subject of a Guardian investigation into pay and working conditions at its warehouse in December, was ejected from the FTSE 100 group of leading shares this month as concerns about its weak trading combined with unrest about its governance and methods. The House of Commons business select committee has been pursuing Ashley, who owns 55% of the company, to answer questions about Sports Direct\u2019s treatment of staff and governance. Ashley has refused, accusing MPs of trying to create a damaging media circus around the company. Analysts at the stockbroker Peel Hunt said Ashley\u2019s complaints showed he was failing to address the \u201cstrategic crisis\u201d at the company. Big brands such as Nike and Adidas are fed up with Sports Direct\u2019s unattractive stores and poor service and have stopped sending it their top products, the analysts said. \u201cBlaming the weather, MPs, the press and the astrological position of Saturn just [smacks of] a business in denial. The more that management blames everybody but themselves for the situation, the longer recovery will take,\u201d the analysts said. They cut their price target for Sports Direct by 50p a share to 325p. Ashley\u2019s comments are likely to reinforce the view of many investors that Sports Direct operates outside the norms of other large public companies. Shareholders are increasingly unhappy about the grip Ashley has on the company as its majority shareholder and deputy chairman. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, criticised Sports Direct for taking more than a day to set the record straight after Ashley\u2019s comments appeared. Companies are meant to keep investors informed about their performance in a timely and orderly manner.",
