      "bodyText": "Inmarsat, Britain\u2019s leading satellite company, has rejected a bid approach from a US rival, in what could signal the start of a fresh foreign takeover saga. Responding to a 13.5% rise in its share price on Friday, Inmarsat admitted it had received an offer from Colorado-based EchoStar that it said \u201cvery significantly undervalued\u201d the company and its prospects. If EchoStar persists, Inmarsat is likely to become the focus of renewed concern about takeovers of leading British businesses, coming shortly after Melrose finally succeeded with its controversial \u00a38bn pursuit of engineer GKN. Like GKN, Inmarsat, which employs more than 1,500 people, has provided technology used by the British armed forces, although its largest single customer is the US military. The London-based company, which has 13 communications satellites in orbit, provided satellite services to the Ministry of Defence to improve ground communications for soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Its \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d technology was used in the hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which disappeared in 2014 and is believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. The firm has repeatedly won praise from the government thanks to its leadership position in the British space industry, excluding the Franco-German industrial group Airbus, which has sizeable operations in the UK but is French-owned. Former chancellor George Osborne praised Inmarsat in 2012 as he announced \u00a31.2bn of funding over five years to increase Britain\u2019s role in European space projects. The UK\u2019s place in the European Space Agency, which is working on the \u20ac10bn Galileo satellite navigation system, is now uncertain amid the ongoing Brexit negotiations. Inmarsat is also a world leader in several cutting-edge technologies such as mobile satellite communications and maritime and aviation safety, while it is among the largest providers of inflight internet for airlines. Its four Global Xpress satellites provide the world\u2019s only global high-speed broadband operation, with a fifth satellite due to launch next year to increase capacity. It is also working with Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom on the European Aviation Network, which will provide high-speed broadband to air passengers across the continent. Despite Inmarsat\u2019s leading position in several markets, New York-listed EchoStar is the larger company based on its stock market value of \u00a33.4bn, compared with the UK firm\u2019s \u00a32.2bn after its stock market surge on Friday. EchoStar\u2019s interest is likely to be fuelled in part by Inmarsat\u2019s exposure to the US, given that the US military is the company\u2019s largest single customer. But if the US firm persists with its bid, it could face political opposition similar to that seen during Melrose\u2019s bid for GKN. A group of MPs urged the business secretary, Greg Clark, to block that deal on national security grounds. Security is one of the few reasons the government can prevent a takeover and the MPs cited fears that GKN could be broken up and sold to overseas buyers. If it is to stave off EchoStar\u2019s interest, Inmarsat\u2019s management \u2013 led by chief executive Rupert Pearce \u2013 will be reliant on the support of major shareholders, with whom it has been at loggerheads over pay. A revolt from more than 60% of voting investors earlier this year forced Inmarsat to rip up its pay proposals, continuing a long-running dispute that had broken out into rebellion three times in the past six years. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWhile no formal bid or offer has been made, we are monitoring the situation. However, this is a commercial matter for the companies involved.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s grocers are going vegan in an attempt to keep up with their customers\u2019 increasingly health-conscious food choices. Waitrose this week launched dedicated vegan sections in more than 130 stores after increasing its vegan and vegetarian product range by 60%. Iceland is also rapidly expanding its vegan range after its meat-free No Bull burgers outsold their wagyu beef counterparts so far this year, while sales of its vegetable-based food have risen by 10% over the past 12 months. Chloe Graves, who runs the vegan and vegetarian range at Waitrose, said the retailer had responded to customer demand after sales of vegetarian food rose by more than a third over the past year. She said: \u201cIt is just becoming more normal now to have a couple of days a week meat-free for environmental or health reasons.\u201d She said younger people were talking about veganism on social media, but Waitrose\u2019s old shoppers were also keen to buy into the idea of being \u201cflexitarian\u201d \u2013 switching between vegetarian or vegan meals on some nights and eating meat on others. The number of vegans in the UK, who shun all animal products including dairy and eggs, has grown fourfold in the past 10 years to about 550,000, according to the Vegan Society. As celebrities including the Strictly Come Dancing winner Jay McGuiness and the actor Joanna Lumley line up to back World Meat Free week starting on Monday, market analyst Kantar has suggested 2018 is the year veganism goes mainstream. It says Britons ate 200m more meat-free meals last year while spending on meat substitutes such as Quorn rose by \u00a330m year on year. Veganism is carving out a niche on Instagram, and enjoys hipster cache at events such as London\u2019s Vegan Nights and the weekly Hackney Downs market established by the influential blogger Sean O\u2019Callaghan, AKA \u201cthe Fat Gay Vegan\u201d. There have also been festivals dedicated to the trend at venues as far afield as Totnes in Devon and Inverness in Scotland. Big chains such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco and Pret a Manger now push vegan ranges, and Pizza Hut recently joined Pizza Express and Zizzi in offering vegan pizzas. Last year Guinness went vegan and stopped using fish bladders in its brewing process, after two and a half centuries. Tesco is reportedly working on a deal that could mean the meat-free Beyond Burger \u2013 a hit in the US \u2013 is stocked in its freezers this summer. It comes after the UK\u2019s largest supermarket chain hired the US chef and self-proclaimed \u201cplant pusher\u201d Derek Sarno as its \u201cdirector of plant-based innovation\u201d to spearhead its vegetarian Wicked Kitchen range. Neil Nugent, the head chef at Iceland, where he is helping the frozen food specialist tap into new trends, said the company hoped to launch more meat-free products in the autumn after finding over-50s were just as keen on the idea as young millenials. \u201cIt has taken us all by surprise. Customers are saying can you do more,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the vegan and flexitarian market is the first major food trend that has come out of social media. Avocado was one thing but everyone is getting behind eating more veg.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed in the red tonight, hit by worries that G7 meeting will develop into a diplomatic punch-up. The FTSE 100 shed 23 points, or 0.3%, while German\u2019s DAX lost 44 points, or 0.35%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was the big loser, dropping by almost 2% as traders fretted about the new Italian government. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: European stocks spent much of the session in the red as trade tensions weighed on investor sentiment. The G7 meeting gets under way today in Quebec, and investors are cautious as certain trading relationships are a little strained. Those talks in Quebec will run for hours and continue tomorrow (although without Donald Trump). Leaders are being pushed to make gender equality a top priority, alongside climate change and trade. Keep an eye on our website for the latest developments. Goodnight! GW Newsflash: British satellite company Inmarsat had found itself in a takeover battle. Shares in the company jumped by 13.5% today, sparking speculation that the company could be \u2018in play\u2019...and it is! Inmarsat has just told the City that it has rejected an approach from US rival Echostar. It says: The Board of Inmarsat plc notes today\u2019s recent press speculation and movement in its share price and confirms that it received a highly preliminary and indicative non-binding proposal from Echostar Corporation in relation to the potential acquisition of the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of Inmarsat (the \u201cProposal\u201d). After carefully considering the Proposal with its advisers the Board rejected the Proposal on the basis that it very significantly undervalued Inmarsat and its standalone prospects. The Board remains highly confident in the independent strategy and prospects of Inmarsat. Echostar now has until 6 July to make a firm offer, or walk away. Inmarsat is now valued at around \u00a32.2bn, following todays share price move. Italy\u2019s debt has come under pressure today, sending yields on Italian government bonds higher. The FT says the are several factors, both at home and in Frankfurt..... Strategists are uncertain over how the newly-formed populist government will work with Brussels, and also over its fiscal plans. At the same time, a string of hawkish speeches from ECB policymakers earlier this week have revved up expectations that the central bank will announce next week the end of its bond buying programme. Quantitative easing has been a boon to eurozone government debt, helping push yields lower. European Council president Donald Tusk, who is attending the G7 meeting, insists that European delegates will maintain a united front. Tusk also played down the idea that Russia could be readmitted to the gathering, despite Donald Trump\u2019s comments earlier: He said: \u201cThis morning I had the first and very good, promising meeting with Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and I am convinced that here at the G7 we will have a fully united European position on all issues. Including on Russia. I am not talking about details but about the more general common line. Tusk also put his finger on the challenge facing world leaders: BT\u2019s shares are still near the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard this afternoon, as traders digest the exit of CEO Gavin Patterson. They\u2019re currently up 1.1% at 205p. Back in 2013, when Patterson was appointed, they were worth 300p, so there\u2019s been some value destruction on his watch. BT\u2019s shares did rise early in Patterson\u2019s tenure, hitting \u00a35 in 2016. But they then fell back as BT struggled to hit growth and earnings targets - despite spending a lot of money on sports rights. Last month\u2019s profit warning, released alongside the latest strategy, was the last straw, sending shares to six-year lows. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cPerhaps fittingly, Gavin Patterson\u2019s tenure was very much a game of two halves. The rise of BT\u2019s Sport coverage, which has stepped up to challenge the dominance of Sky initially brought some good times for investors. However, it\u2019s been a different story over the last two years. Since 2016, BT\u2019s share price graph resembles something of a black run; pretty much always on a downward trend and with a few nasty cliffs here and there. Ultimately, this is what\u2019s behind the change. Shareholder confidence has followed the share price down, and with BT embarking on a crucial restructure, the board has decided it\u2019s time for a change. Here\u2019s our news story about Trump\u2019s comments: US stock markets have followed Europe and Asia\u2019s lead, and dipped in early trading. It\u2019s a modest fall, though; the Dow Jones industrial average has shed 40-odd point, or 0.15%., while the Nasdaq is down 0.5%. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has reportedly backed Trump\u2019s call for Russia to be reinstated. It raises the prospect of the G7 becoming the G8 again... unless it shrinks to become the G6 first, of course. Breaking: The pound is falling as the Europe Union\u2019s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, gives a thumping thumbs down to the UK\u2019s latest proposal. Barnier has rejected Theresa May\u2019s proposal that Britain should stay in the customs union until the end of 2021 unless a new customs agreement is agreed once Brexit has occured. He is telling journalists in Brussels that the backstop cannot apply to the whole UK, but could apply to Northern Ireland. Barnier also takes issue with the \u2018time-limited\u2019 nature of the UK\u2019s offer. He insists that \u201cbackstop means backstop\u201d (a wry jibe at May\u2019s claim that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d). This has to be a backstop that provides a guarantee under all circumstances. This is another blow to the UK\u2019s position - which was only agreed yesterday after crunch talks between May and Brexit secretary David Davis. Barnier also claimed that the UK\u2019s position is \u201cparadoxical\u201d (because London wants to leave the EU but maintain many of its advantages). The pound has dropped by 0.5% against the US dollar, or 0.66 of a cent, to $1.336. Our Politics Live blog has all the action: Trump has added further spice to the G7 meeting, by telling reporters in Washington that Russian president Vladimir Putin should be joining the throng in Quebec: Russia\u2019s membership of the G8 (as it then was) was suspended after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Given events since, such as the Salisbury Novichok attack, I don\u2019t think Putin is welcome back.... Trump also declared that Canada, the EU and Mexico all treat America very badly when it come to trade, meaning we can dial down expectations for a successful G7 even lower.... Donald Trump\u2019s social media sledging isn\u2019t doing much for the mood on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to fall by 136 points at the open, or around 0.5%. America\u2019s increased isolation on the world stage is worrying traders, says Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA. While Trump has at times appeared friendly with certain other heads of state in the past, the relationships have at least appeared to have become more hostile since tariffs were imposed on the European Union, Canada and Mexico by the US last week. The G7 meeting has become more like a G6+1, with Trump choosing to isolate the US on a number of issues from trade to Iran and climate change. The Nasdaq is heading for an 0.8% drop, with Apple called down 2% following reports it is taking a \u201ccautious\u201d approach toward upcoming iPhone shipments this year. Trump has thrown down the gauntlet: We\u2019ll try to hold the president to that last pledge.... However, I suspect the talks will mostly centre on the recent tariffs imposed by the United States on its allies: In another sign that America is detaching from fellow advanced economies, Donald Trump will actually leave the G7 meeting early. The president is due to leave Quebec on Saturday morning, meaning he\u2019ll miss the summit\u2019s second day. Trump is flying to Singapore for his historic meeting with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un. The talks could lead to a thawing of tensions between the two countries; but with such unpredictable leaders, anything is possible. My colleague Julian Borger explains how the Trump-Kim meeting could unfold: Trump has sought to play down expectations, characterising the meeting as \u201cgetting-to-know-you, plus\u201d. But without a substantial \u201cplus\u201d in the form of progress in the direction of disarmament, the meeting will widely be deemed a failure. And to achieve that progress, Trump will have to make significant gestures towards what Kim wants most \u2013 security guarantees. Both leaders will go into the Singapore meeting with cards in their hands, representing quick, deliverable concessions. The big question next week will be which cards they play and in what sequence. At a minimum, Kim will be expected to formalise the current suspension of nuclear and missile testing. He could go further by declaring a cap on his existing arsenal freeze on other nuclear activity like uranium enrichment. His biggest element of his opening offer, however, would be a statement on his plans to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, and here everything will be in the details \u2013 how clearly denuclearisation is defined, and whether Kim commits to a timetable. Just in: Donald Trump is limbering up for the G7 meeting by firing another attack at Canada over trade tariffs: Trump is referring to Canada\u2019s \u201cSupply management\u201d regime, a long-running point of dispute between the two countries. This system specifies fixed prices paid to farmers, strict quotas for how much they can produce, and a tariff wall to prevent cheaper imports from abroad. The result: stable incomes for farmers, who are protected from bankruptcy in lean times, at the cost of higher prices for Canadian consumers. American farmers, though, want to send their own milk and butter north, and Trump is pushing their case. Emerging market currencies are being hit badly today, as investors scramble into the safety of the US dollar instead. The South African rand, the Turkish lira and the Indian rupee have all suffered sharp falls. This kind of action puts pressure on domestic policymakers to consider raising interest rates to prevent capital flight - a move that also hurts economic growth. Yesterday, Turkey\u2019s central bank hikes its benchmark rate to a blistering 17.75%, from 16.5%, in an attempt to prop up the lira. Angela Merkel has received some unwelcome news as she prepares for the G7 meeting -- German industrial output and exports both fell in April. Factory output across Germany shrank by 1% in April, dashing expectations that it would rise by 0.3%. The Federal Statistics Office also reported that German exports fell by 0.3% in April while imports rose by 2.2%. That helps to narrow Germany\u2019s trade surplus, so could be welcomed by its neighbours. The wider concern, though, is that trade war fears are hurting demand for German goods. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management is gloriously unimpressed by this weekend\u2019s G7 shindig, arguing that little will be achieved in Quebec. But markets could slide if Donald Trump falls out badly with fellow world leaders. Donovan says: Several heads of government disappear off for a taxpayer-financed weekend mini-break in Canada today. The G5, G7, G8, and now G6 plus 1 have never really accomplished very much after the first burst of enthusiasm with the Plaza and Louvre accords of the 1980s. This meeting will be no different. Because the G6 plus 1 is about spin not substance, the risks for markets come from the visual from this meeting. The US is looking isolated. This is not the isolationism and protectionism of the 1930s. In the 1930s everyone put up trade barriers against everyone else. This time the US is putting up trade barriers against everyone else, and everyone else is carrying on just as before. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit says the international trade system is more complex than Donald Trump suggests.... Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the EU and Canada have sent traders racing to sell risky assets, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. Interest rate realities are sinking back in ahead of what\u2019s going to be a not particularly cordial G7 summit in Canada. It\u2019s little wonder that risk-aversion has returned. Odeluga points out that G7 summits can often disappoint -- but his week\u2019s one could be especially worrying: Even under \u2018normal\u2019 circumstances, markets tend to write-off the chances that G7 summits will result in concrete communiques with lasting impact. The current U.S. administration back-tracked on climate-related pledges within weeks of the last meeting. It also took its first steps on the trade war path despite the anti-\u201cprotectionism\u201d sentiments addressed in the prior G7 statement. With new U.S. tariffs now lodged against all but one of the remaining six members and Trump tweeting his still combative mood overnight, some leaders might be wondering if there might be more productive ways to spend their time this weekend. No wonder markets are falling. Overnight, Donald Trump launched a fierce attack on his fellow G7 leaders via Twitter, accusing Europe and Canada of treating America unfairly. Trump signed off that he\u2019s \u2018looking forward\u2019 to meeting Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macon in Quebec.... having further stoked the feud between the US and the rest. Macron responded more tactfully, tweeting that tensions are rising everywhere, and the G7 meeting will be demanding. A wave of selling has swept through Europe\u2019s trading floors this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 58 points or 0.75%, to 7645 points. Nearly every share is down -- BT jumped 2.5% at the open, but has now subsided. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames geopolitical worries: A likely feisty G7 meeting in Quebec appears to be the main thing driving the markets lower. Investors are either worried that nothing will get resolved, or Trump will become more entrenched in his aggressive approach to trade. Germany\u2019s DAX has also started the day badly - down 1.1% - while France\u2019s CAC is down 0.6%. BT tweets... ...because the incumbent is being kicked out by the chairman?... Geoff Cutmore of CNBC questions whether BT will stick with Patterson\u2019s strategy to revitalise BT, and cut 13,000 jobs, if he\u2019s now surplus to requirements. Cutmore\u2019s colleague, Karen Tso, points out that transforming BT into a tech-focused company is a huge challenge: It emerged earlier this week that BT shareholders were agitating for change, with top investors demanding talks with chairman Jan du Plessis. We wrote on Monday that du Plessis has already held meetings with investors, with more planned. Clearly the mood wasn\u2019t great. As one top investor told the FT: \u201cI don\u2019t have much faith in Gavin....Since he took over [five years ago], it has not been a happy time for shareholders. I am not sure he is the right man for the job.\u201d Today\u2019s statement suggests that du Plessis and the rest of the board came to the same conclusion, deciding that \u2018a change of leadership\u2019 is needed. As Richard Fletcher of The Times puts it, du Plessis has now \u2018ousted\u2019 Patterson: A wobbly day\u2019s trading in Asia has seen Japan\u2019s Nikkei drop 0.5%, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index lose 1.5%, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng lose 1.7%. David Madden of CMC Markets says G7 worries are mounting. The G7 meeting starts today in Quebec. Traders will be paying attention to see if any progress is made regarding trade talks. President Tump is in the eye of the trade storm, and he is letting the world know he means business, and he is determined to get the best deal for the US. At the moment, investors aren\u2019t overly concerned about the state of play, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a pain threshold. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some breaking news to start the morning: Gavin Patterson is stepping down as chief executive of BT, in the face of criticism from investors. The telecoms giant has announced that Patterson will leave later this year -- after concluding that a \u2018change of leadership\u2019 is needed. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The company said that it had already started the process of looking for his successor, and expected to appoint a new chief executive in the second half of the year. Jan du Plessis, chairman of BT, thanked Patterson for his contribution but said the company needed a change in leadership. He said: \u201cThe board is fully supportive of the strategy recently set out by Gavin and his team. The broader reaction to our recent results announcement has though demonstrated to Gavin and me that there is a need for a change of leadership to deliver this strategy.\u201d Patterson was clearly under pressure; BT\u2019s share price hit its lowest level since 2012 last month. It emerged earlier this week that some investors were losing patience with Patterson, who has been spending billions of pounds on sports rights such as Premier League football in an attempt to attract customers to its TV service. This looks like a rather humiliating way to go, just four weeks after announcing a new strategy and thousands of job cuts. More on that shortly.... Also coming up today Investors will be watching La Malbaie in Quebec, as Canada hosts the G7 meeting of world leaders. It could turn into a G6 +1, though, as America faces criticism over its trade policies from the UK, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Canada. European markets are expected to fall, with the FTSE 100 called down 35 points, after Asian markets dropped back. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says \u2018risk aversion\u2019 is rising, as investors fear the meeting will be fraught. Given the quiet economic calendar today, the continuing trade spat between the US its closet allies will attract a good deal of attention as the G7 summit begins. The broader US market posted its first loss in 5 days as the recent equity rally, and more specifically tech rally, faltered, whilst investors started to show unease over the potential climate at the G7 Summit. Souring investor sentiment resulted in a softer session for Asia and indicates a weaker start for Europe on the open.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s is \u201cin the money\u201d, having earned nearly \u00a33.4m in the past year \u2013 up 45% on the previous year \u2013 as a result of a big cash bonus and incentive scheme payouts. Mike Coupe was widely mocked in April when he was filmed singing one of the best known songs from the musical 42nd Street. An accomplished musician, he was caught off-guard singing while waiting to be interviewed on ITV about a planned merger with Asda. The grocer\u2019s latest annual report shows Coupe was correct \u2013 his annual pay rocketed by more than \u00a31m last year, including a \u00a3427,000 annual bonus. His fellow directors Kevin O\u2019Byrne, the finance chief, and John Rogers, who heads the Argos business, also earned annual bonuses worth more than \u00a3400,000, taking their pay to \u00a31.45m and \u00a32.21m respectively. Details of the boardroom payouts at Sainsbury\u2019s have emerged as the retailer faces criticism about changes to pay and conditions for its shop workers that will leave about 9,000 staff worse off. Coupe received the cash bonus despite reporting a near 19% fall in profits, because he hit targets linked to the supermarket\u2019s takeover of Argos and the Nectar loyalty card scheme and also met a minimum profit target. He received a \u00a31m long-term share bonus relating to performance at the business over the three previous years, and a \u00a3758,000 deferred share bonus, up from \u00a3716,000 a year before. The Sainsbury\u2019s boss, who hopes the competition watchdog will approve the planned takeover of Asda within the next 18 months, was paid \u00a3943,428 in basic salary. He has recently had a 2% pay rise to \u00a3962,297. The Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, who has been campaigning to persuade Sainsbury\u2019s to change its staff pay plans, said: \u201cWhat self-respecting chief executive would accept \u00a31m pay rise while simultaneously slashing the salaries of 9,000 of his most loyal and longstanding staff? While Mike Coupe sings how he is \u2018in the money\u2019, his most dedicated staff are being made to work for less.\u201d The union Unite is considering legal action after the supermarket said it was pressing ahead with a plan to cut paid breaks, annual bonuses and premium pay for Sundays. The retailer says is investing \u00a3110m in a wage increase for 93% of its 130,000 shop workers \u2013 from \u00a38 to \u00a39.20 an hour, or \u00a39.80 in London \u2013 to give an average pay rise of 9.3%. Sainsbury\u2019s has pledged to make up the difference in earnings for those who have lost out for the first 18 months and then review its policy in March 2020. Coupe\u2019s pay package remains substantially less than rival supermarket bosses, with Dave Lewis at Tesco facing a potential backlash from investors at next week\u2019s annual shareholder meeting after earning nearly \u00a34.9m last year, up 17.5%. David Potts at Morrisons earned \u00a35.8m last year when he doubled his pay after earning a \u00a33m long-term bonus.",

      "bodyText": "A group advising House of Fraser landlords has hit out at proposals that would see them \u201ctake all the pain\u201d while shareholders benefit from \u00a370m pumped into the ailing department store chain. House of Fraser is proposing to close of 31 of its 59 stores, and as part of a rescue plan is seeking creditors\u2019 permission to slash rent bills at these outlets, as well as at some of those not being axed. This would be done under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a controversial form of insolvency being used by a growing number of struggling high street chains. Typically, property owners are asked to accept lower rents to help a tenant avoid financial collapse \u2013 something many landlords say amounts to companies attempting to wriggle out of their rental obligations. Landlords are particularly unhappy about the way the CVA process often allows creditors such as banks, bondholders and shareholders who won\u2019t share in the pain of rent cuts to vote to impose new terms on a minority of creditors. The House of Fraser store closures are a condition of a deal that would give control of the department store chain to the Chinese owner of Hamleys, C.banner, which has committed to injecting \u00a370m of fresh capital into the retailer once the restructuring has been carried out. However high street landlords have already been railing against what they say is the misuse of the CVA process, and this latest episode has added to their anger. Charlotte Coates is a restructuring specialist at property advisory firm JLL, which is working with consultancy Begbies Traynor to advise a group of House of Fraser landlords through the CVA process to negotiate a better deal for them. That C.banner is paying for new shares is proving particularly controversial. Coates said it was time to ask whether it was unfairly prejudicial to have a situation where a business that had gone wrong was getting a \u00a370m payment, while at the same time \u201casking landlords to take all the pain\u201d via reduced rents. She said this would not be happening if the business was going into administration, and added that the group was taking legal advice. Ian Fletcher, director of policy at the British Property Federation, the landlord industry group, pointed out that House of Fraser had previously sold some of its stores on sale and leaseback deals. For example, a 1999 deal with British Land raised \u00a3147m and put 15 stores on 40-year leases (it is understood that only two stores remain in British Land\u2019s portfolio). \u201cSome of those landlords will be particularly aggrieved by the CVA \u2026 House of Fraser got the money, but that was in return for taking a lease and honouring it.\u201d Fletcher said there was \u201ca feeling that some of the recent CVAs are not proper CVAs. A proper CVA and restructuring would look at all the different aspects of the business \u2026 There\u2019s a big concern that these exercises are just shedding lease liabilities and not doing a proper holistic restructuring of the business.\u201d He added that by focusing on property, it may be that the CVA \u201cis just putting off the day when the business will go into administration\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The City regulator has changed its listing rules, in a move that boosts London\u2019s chances of hosting the $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) stock market flotation of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s move was criticised, however, by business and investment organisations who said they were disappointed by the decision because it waived some corporate governance rules. The FCA did not explicitly mention Saudi Aramco, which plans to raise $100bn (\u00a375bn) by selling a 5% stake, but the step is an important one in London\u2019s efforts to attract the listing ahead of rivals New York and Hong Kong. Aramco is likely to be valued at about $2tn, more than twice as much as Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company. The regulator has created a new category with its premium listing regime to allow the state-owned company to list on the London Stock Exchange. It means Aramco will not have to sign up to a controlling shareholder agreement, which requires the biggest investor to operate at an arm\u2019s length from the business, nor be subject to shareholder approval for related party transactions. The finalised rules, which follow an FCA consultation launched last year, are expected to make London more appealing for an Aramco listing. The director general of the Institute of Directors, Stephen Martin, said: \u201cThe IoD is deeply disappointed that the FCA has decided to press ahead with the creation of a new premium listing category, which reduces key corporate governance requirements. \u201cThis decision has been made despite opposition from across the governance spectrum and without providing evidence as to the necessity for the reduction in standards.\u201d Royal London Asset Management said it was pleased the FCA had listened to concerns about changing the listings regime, but that \u201cwe still think that the new rules fall short of the high governance standards that investors expect in the UK\u201d. The Investment Association, the trade body for UK investment managers, said there could be \u201cunintended consequences\u201d and called on the FCA to review the segment after two years. The FCA defended the rule changes, saying the decision would encourage more firms to adopt the UK\u2019s governance standards. Its chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said: \u201cThese rules mean when a sovereign-controlled company lists here, investors can benefit from the protections offered by a premium listing. \u201cThis raises standards. This package recognises that the previous regime did not always work for these companies or their investors.\u201d Bailey has told MPs that waiving rules for sovereign-owned companies will not weaken protections for investors. He met Aramco early last year but said he had not done so again since and had no plans to do so. \u201cTo be clear, this was not divined with Aramco,\u201d he said. The new category, which will be effective from July, was welcomed by the City of London Corporation and the trade body for the financial services industry. The corporation said it would ensure the City\u2019s global competitiveness , and lobbying body TheCityUK said that Britain could not be complacent despite having one of the \u201cworld\u2019s foremost listing regimes.\u201d The Saudi Aramco IPO had been planned for late 2018 but the Saudi energy minister recently confirmed speculation that the flotation was likely to be delayed until next year. The valuation of the company will hinge on the oil price. Brent crude recently hit $80 a barrel, but has since fallen slightly in anticipation of the oil cartel Opec increasing supplies after the US asked Saudi Arabia to boost production.",

    "webTitle": "BT chief executive Gavin Patterson to leave this year", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The BT chief executive, Gavin Patterson, is to leave the telecoms giant this year after investors made it clear they had lost confidence in his ability to lead the company through an ambitious turnaround plan. In a surprise move, the company said it had started the process of looking for his successor and expected to appoint a new chief executive in the second half of the year. Jan du Plessis, the chair of BT, thanked Patterson for his contribution over the past 14 years but said the company needed a change in leadership, despite having publicly backed him a month ago. Du Plessis said on Friday: \u201cThe board is fully supportive of the strategy recently set out by Gavin and his team. The broader reaction to our recent results announcement has, though, demonstrated to Gavin and me that there is a need for a change of leadership to deliver this strategy.\u201d The announcement comes after a backlash from shareholders over BT\u2019s recent results and concerns that Patterson was not the right person to lead the company through an ambitious restructuring plan. Investors welcomed the news, with BT shares initially rising 2.5% to 208p. When Patterson was appointed chief executive in September 2013, the shares were trading at about 340p, before hitting a high of almost 500p in early 2016. Neil Wilson, the chief analyst at markets.com, said investors had \u201cfinally lost patience and driven him out\u201d. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s been more wrong than right for BT since he took over five year ago. It\u2019s been a disappointing time for BT and for its shareholders.\u201d The restructuring strategy includes 13,000 job cuts and a move out of BT\u2019s central London headquarters after almost 150 years as it attempts to slash costs amid growing competition and falling revenues. BT missed profit and revenue targets in the year to the end of March, sending shares in the company to a six-year low. Days after the news of the job cuts, BT revealed Patterson was paid about \u00a32.3m last year, including a \u00a31.3m bonus on top of his basic salary of \u00a3997,000. At the time of the strategy update last month, Du Plessis publicly endorsed Patterson as the person to steer the company through the changes but the position changed after the BT chair held a series of conversations with shareholders. Patterson said he was disappointed the market had not responded as positively as he would have liked to the planned changes. He said he felt the broad message from investors was \u201cwe like the strategy, it\u2019s going to take a while to see the benefits, come back to us when you\u2019ve got results\u201d. Patterson, who has been at BT for more than 14 years, will remain CEO until a replacement is found. Reflecting on his time in the role, Patterson said: \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who has regrets \u2013 I try to look forward. There hasn\u2019t been any falling out. I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019ve seen this movie before.\u201d Patterson will continue to be paid his usual monthly salary until his successor is appointed, after which point he will be entitled to up to 12 monthly payments covering his basic salary, benefits and bonus. Based on current projections, that means he could walk away with about \u00a32.3m, in line with his salary and bonus last year. Under Patterson\u2019s leadership, the business has transformed and become more complex, with a big push into sports broadcasting through BT Sport and the \u00a312.5bn purchase of EE, the British mobile phone network, which got the final go-ahead in January 2016 and which Patterson said was one of the highlights of his stint. But he has led the FTSE 100 firm through a troubled 18 months, including an accounting scandal in Italy and a record \u00a342m fine from Ofcom. George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the first half of Patterson\u2019s tenure as chief executive had been positive, with the rise of BT Sport bringing some good times for investors. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s been a different story over the last two years. Since 2016, BT\u2019s share price graph resembles something of a black run: pretty much always on a downward trend and with a few nasty cliffs here and there. \u201cUltimately, this is what\u2019s behind the change. Shareholder confidence has followed the share price down and with BT embarking on a crucial restructure, the board has decided it\u2019s time for a change.\u201d Five issues for BT under Patterson\u2019s tenure 1. Italian accounting scandal Almost \u00a38bn was wiped of BT\u2019s stock market value after it admitted an accounting scandal at its Italian division was much worse than originally thought. The company said \u201cinappropriate management behaviour\u201d and \u201cimproper accounting practices\u201d in Italy would cost BT \u00a3530m. 2. Openreach deal took too long BT spent two years at loggerheads with the communications regulator over Openreach, which controls the UK\u2019s broadband network. Ofcom wanted to strengthen the independence of Openreach and BT ultimately agreed a deal to legally separate the business. But it was a lengthy battle, and Patterson admitted on Friday he wished he had concluded negotiations a lot sooner. 3. Falling revenues and complexity BT reported a 1% fall in revenue to \u00a323bn for the year to 31 March 2018 and warned that it was expecting a similar performance in the year ahead. BT became a more complex business under Patterson, increasingly diverse and with multiple offices in some cities, and the outgoing chief executive has admitted it needs to modernise. 4. Record fine for BT BT was fined \u00a342m \u2013 the largest penalty imposed by Ofcom on a telecoms company \u2013 for a \u201cserious breach\u201d of rules. The regulator found that BT broke regulations put in place to stop Openreach abusing its \u201csignificant market power\u201d by cutting compensation payments to rivals and blaming installation delays on factors beyond its control when this was not the case. BT also said it would pay \u00a3300m in compensation to rivals including Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk. 5. A costly move into sports broadcasting BT Sport transformed the telecoms company into a major sports broadcaster. But the question remains whether it was the right move to diversify into a sector in which Sky, Netflix and Amazon are its rivals. Deep pockets are required to pay for the rising cost of sports rights, and analysts have warned that sports-TV packages are the kind of thing that struggling households get rid of first.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has stepped in to shore up the Argentinian economy with a $50bn (\u00a337bn) loan agreement. Argentina requested assistance from the international lender of last resort on 8 May after the peso weakened sharply in an investor exodus from emerging markets. As part of the deal, which is subject to IMF board approval, the government pledged to accelerate plans to reduce the fiscal deficit \u2013 the gap between government spending and revenue \u2013 even as authorities now foresee lower growth and higher inflation in the coming years. The deal marks a turning point for Argentina, which for years shunned the IMF after a devastating economic crisis in 2001-02 that many Argentinians blamed on IMF-imposed austerity measures. The president Mauricio Macri\u2019s decision to turn to the lender has triggered national protests. \u201cThere is no magic: the IMF can help but Argentines need to resolve our own problems,\u201d the treasury minister said at a news conference on Thursday. Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne said he expected the IMF board to approve the deal during a meeting on 20 June. After that, he said he expected an immediate disbursement of 30% of the funding, or about $15bn. Argentina will seek to reduce its fiscal deficit to 1.3% of gross domestic product in 2019, down from 2.2% previously, Dujovne said. The deal calls for fiscal balance in 2020 and a fiscal surplus of 0.5% of GDP in 2020. The IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said: \u201cThis measure will ultimately lessen the government financing needs, put public debt on a downward trajectory and, as President Macri has stated, relieve a burden from Argentina\u2019s back.\u201d The interest rate will be from 1.96% to 4.96%, depending on how much Argentina uses. The country must pay back each disbursement in eight quarterly instalments, with a three-year grace period. As widely expected, the government will also send a proposal to Congress to reform the central bank\u2019s charter and strengthen its autonomy. The central bank will also stop transferring money to the treasury, a practice known locally as the \u201clittle machine\u201d, which is seen as a key driver of incessant inflation. \u201cThe little machine has been turned off; it has been unplugged,\u201d the central bank governor, Federico Sturzenegger, said. The IMF\u2019s backing was expected to bolster Argentinian assets, which have sagged in recent months amid a global sell-off in emerging markets. Neighbouring Brazil, Latin America\u2019s largest economy, has also seen its currency weaken in recent days to its lowest level in more than two years amid fears over the county\u2019s fiscal outlook and political future. \u201cIt is convincing and greatly exceeds expectations. Markets should react very positively tomorrow,\u201d tweeted Miguel Kiguel, a former finance secretary in Argentina. \u201cIt is clear the country has capacity to pay.\u201d However, the short-term picture remains more complicated than it appeared several months ago. Dujovne said economic growth was expected at 1.4% for 2018 and 1.5-2.5% for 2019, down from expectations above 3% in both years. The central bank would also abandon its 2018 inflation target of 15% and would not aim for any particular level this year, Sturzenegger said. Argentina agreed to new, looser inflation targets of 17% for 2019, 13% for 2020 and 9% for 2021, down from 25% currently. \u201cThey are mortgaging the future for our children and grandchildren,\u201d tweeted Mart\u00edn Sabbatella, a politician aligned with the former populist president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Argentina and the IMF said the deal would protect the most vulnerable. In a separate statement, the president\u2019s office said it had clinched agreements for an additional $5.65bn from the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the CAF development bank over the next 12 months.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading employers\u2019 organisation, the Confederation of British Industry, has warned the UK economy will shift down a gear this year and risks remaining in the slow lane because of Brexit. Cutting its growth forecasts for the year, owing to heavy snowfall in the opening months of 2018 and lingering fears over Brexit, the CBI said it expected the growth rate for the British economy to slow to 1.4%, from 1.8% last year. The rate of GDP growth is then forecast to fall further still, to 1.3% next year, as the UK leaves the EU. The downgrade comes as business groups become increasingly worried about the lack of progress being made by ministers in talks with Brussels, amid divisions between senior cabinet members. Business leaders fear there will be little progress made before parliament breaks for its summer recess next month. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, said companies needed to know how they would access the single market and customs union after Brexit. The summer recess is seen as an important cut-off point because ministers will need to go to Brussels with a clear plan for crunch talks in the autumn. \u201cThere\u2019s a real danger\u201d no progress would be made before the recess, she said. \u201cThe transition deal in March was a huge step forward but a lot of businesses are now saying they still need to know what\u2019s happening after 2020 \u2026 We just haven\u2019t had enough clarity on the customs arrangements and access to the single market.\u201d Official figures show investment by businesses fell by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2018, which is thought to have been triggered by the lack of clarity over Brexit, making companies wary about spending on major projects. Although the CBI forecast a return to growth in spending in the months to come, fuelled by investment in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, it warned uncertainty would continue to bite hard. Alpesh Paleja, principal economist at the CBI, said: \u201cWhile many companies are turning their attention to AI, automation and streamlining operations to stay competitive, there is only so much that they can do when Brexit uncertainty continues to loom large.\u201d While the outcome of the referendum has triggered a damaging slowdown in consumer spending and business investment, the employers\u2019 body warned there would be little to cheer struggling retailers. Dozens of high street chains have announced plans to cut jobs and close stores across the country, including Marks &amp; Spencer and House of Fraser. Hard-pressed Britons reined in their spending amid weak wage growth and high levels of inflation, triggered by the sudden drop in the value of the pound immediately after the Brexit vote. But although the CBI said the worst of the squeeze was over, it expected spending growth to remain subdued. The business body forecast the contribution of consumer spending to GDP growth would fall by a third in 2018, and by a further 40% next year. Despite the sluggish growth rate, the CBI said the economy was probably still strong enough to withstand a rate rise from the Bank of England. Pointing to the return of real wage growth earlier this year, it forecast a rate rise from as early as August, with another two hikes for the cost of borrowing next year to reach 1.25%.",
