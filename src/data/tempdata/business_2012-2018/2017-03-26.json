      "bodyText": "New cars are using vastly more fuel on the road than in laboratory tests, raising further questions about the veracity of car manufacturers\u2019 claims in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The Australian Automobile Association-commissioned research found fuel use was on average 25% higher than claimed on the government-mandated fuel consumption label displayed on all new cars. In some cases, they were 60% above the fuel use claimed on the label. On-road noxious gas emissions from five diesel cars were found to be over the legal limit, in one case by up to eight times. Two petrol cars were significantly above the limits for carbon monoxide emissions. The research, conducted by technical consulting firm Abmarc, examined 17 new and commonly available cars in the past 10 months. The AAA did not name and shame individual manufacturers, but said the cars were selected across brands, vehicle types and fuel types. The 2015 Volkswagen scandal raised serious concerns about the truth of car manufacturers\u2019 emissions claims. Volkswagen was caught installing software in cars that allowed it to game emissions tests in the United States. That scandal was uncovered after environmental groups detected discrepancies between real-world emissions and those recorded in tests. The federal government is currently considering tightening emissions and CO2 standards, effectively moving from the \u201cEuro 5\u201d to \u201cEuro 6\u201d standard. That would bring Australia in line with international standards following years of lagging behind the European Union and the US. The AAA is opposed to the government\u2019s standards proposal, saying it will cost motorists without delivering any benefit to the environment. It last week described the plan as an \u201cuncoordinated process\u201d that had no robust cost-benefit analysis. The AAA chief executive, Michael Bradley, said the results of its latest testing showed the assumptions underpinning the government\u2019s proposal were flawed. \u201cThese results are bad news for Australian consumers looking for good information on which to base their car-buying decisions,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThey also place a huge question mark over the fuel and cost-savings the government is offering Australians under its proposals to introduce tougher vehicle emissions restrictions. \u201cOur test results are a warning to Australians to take the government\u2019s promises of fuel and cost-savings with a grain of salt, and expect those savings to be significantly less than what\u2019s promised.\u201d A spokesman for the urban infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher, said it was well known that pollutants emitted in laboratory conditions would generally be lower than on-road driving tests. He said the way vehicles were tested for emissions was \u201cquite separate\u201d from the current question of whether car emissions should be changed or tightened. \u201cNo decisions have yet been taken \u2013 the matter will be considered by cabinet later this year,\u201d the spokesman said. The cars tested had all driven at least 2,000km but no more than 85,000km, and were 2014 models or newer. The cars were tested twice, from a cold start and a warm start, and were driven along the same route in Melbourne, which contained urban, extra-urban and freeway driving. Bradley said the AAA supported reducing emissions and strengthening standards, but said policy must \u201cdeliver for the environment at the least cost to motorists and the economy\u201d. \u201cThe AAA and Australia\u2019s motoring clubs again call on the government to update its modelling, undertake further public consultation and introduce real-world driving testing for new vehicles in Australia,\u201d he said. The federal government allows the use of test results from international laboratories for assessment against Australian standards. The government also audits test results. The ministerial forum on vehicle emissions is considering how to reduce emissions from Australia\u2019s vehicle fleet. It has released three papers for consultation, including a draft regulation impact statement on new fuel efficiency and noxious emissions standards. Those impact statements included a cost-benefit analysis of the changes, which considered recent studies on the discrepancies between laboratory-tested and on-road emissions. To address the discrepancy, the statements recommended adopting the latest standards, which introduce a more representative laboratory test and an on-road driving emissions test.",

      "bodyText": "BrewDog, the craft beer company that prides itself on a \u201cpunk\u201d ethos, has been accused of acting like \u201cjust another multinational corporate machine\u201d after forcing a family-run pub to change its name or face legal action. The fast-growing Scottish brewer, which has burnished its underdog credentials with vocal criticism of how major brewers operate, recently launched a vodka brand called Lone Wolf. But it threatened legal action against a pub in Birmingham that opened under the same name, prompting allegations of bullying and hypocrisy from within the pubs and brewing community. The brother and sister team behind the pub, Joshua and Sallie McFadyen, said they chose the name in 2015, before BrewDog unveiled its spirits brand. But they say they were too scared of the brewer\u2019s financial muscle to fight back, deciding instead to change the name of their pub to the Wolf and adjust the signage and web page at their own expense. Sallie McFadyen told the Guardian: \u201cWe had an email one day from their solicitors \u2013 and that was the first we knew of it \u2013 saying they had a trademarked spirit coming out. All our money has gone into refurbishing this place and getting it open and we don\u2019t have the same money as they have. We were told we might have to incur their legal costs so we were panic-stricken.\u201d She said she and her brother chose the name the Lone Wolf because they had both previously worked for major pub companies and had decided to go it alone. They were also inspired by Sally\u2019s dog, which \u201clooks like a wolf\u201d, echoing Brewdog\u2019s own name, which is based on co-founder James Watt\u2019s dog. But they have been left disappointed by BrewDog\u2019s decision to pursue them with the threat of legal action. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating because it was quite personal why we called it Lone Wolf,\u201d Sallie McFadyen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come round to it now but it is a bit hypocritical because they make a lot of public statements saying how much they support independence and they don\u2019t like a big corporate attitude. It seems to go against what they stand for and it was done in such a harsh way.\u201d Brewers and beer-lovers denounced BrewDog on social media for threatening an independent pub with legal action over the Lone Wolf name: BrewDog has raised money through an \u201cEquity for Punks\u201d scheme that allows drinkers to invest in return for shares and benefits such as discounts in its bars. But its credentials as a challenger brand were called into question by beer industry figures, including brewers such as Walsall-based microbrewery Backyard Brewhouse, which labelled the Scottish company \u201cjust another multinational corporate machine\u201d. BrewDog declined to comment. The company\u2019s protection of its trademark is particularly surprising given that its founders have previously scorned copyright complaints against them. Last year the company disputed a trademarking claim from the estate of Elvis Presley, which took issue with Brewdog\u2019s Elvis Juice beer. In a statement on the firm\u2019s website, it said: \u201cHere at BrewDog, we don\u2019t take too kindly to petty pen pushers attempting to make a fast buck by discrediting our good name under the guise of copyright infringement.\u201d BrewDog was also told it might face legal action from Wolverhampton Wanderers football club over claims that the branding for Lone Wolf is similar to the club\u2019s own wolf\u2019s head logo. Some drinkers vowed never to let a drop of BrewDog\u2019s beer pass their lips again in protest at its actions: Drinkers who want to find BrewDog\u2019s range won\u2019t be able to do so at the Wolf. \u201cTo be honest it\u2019s got nothing to do with that [the legal threat],\u201d said Sallie McFadyen. \u201cWe try to keep to small breweries.\u201d BrewDog recently told its Equity for Punks shareholders that it is in talks with a major new investor, amid speculation that it is preparing to float some of its shares on the stock market.",

      "bodyText": "The rise of populism has rattled the global political establishment. Brexit came as a shock, as did the victory of Donald Trump. Much head-scratching has resulted as leaders seek to work out why large chunks of their electorates are so cross. The answer seems pretty simple. Populism is the result of economic failure. The 10 years since the financial crisis have shown that the system of economic governance which has held sway for the past four decades is broken. Some call this approach neoliberalism. Perhaps a better description would be unpopulism. Unpopulism meant tilting the balance of power in the workplace in favour of management and treating people like wage slaves. Unpopulism was rigged to ensure that the fruits of growth went to the few not to the many. Unpopulism decreed that those responsible for the global financial crisis got away with it while those who were innocent bore the brunt of austerity. Anybody seeking to understand why Trump won the US presidential election should take a look at what has been happening to the division of the economic spoils. The share of national income that went to the bottom 90% of the population held steady at around 66% from 1950 to 1980. It then began a steep decline, falling to just over 50% when the financial crisis broke in 2007. Similarly, it is no longer the case that everybody benefits when the US economy is doing well. During the business cycle upswing between 1961 and 1969, the bottom 90% of Americans took 67% of the income gains. During the Reagan expansion two decades later they took 20%. During the Greenspan housing bubble of 2001 to 2007, they got just two cents in every extra dollar of national income generated while the richest 10% took the rest. The US economist Thomas Palley* says that up until the late 1970s countries operated a virtuous circle growth model in which wages were the engine of demand growth. \u201cProductivity growth drove wage growth which fueled demand growth. That promoted full employment, which provided the incentive to invest, which drove further productivity growth,\u201d he says. Unpopulism was touted as the antidote to the supposedly failed policies of the postwar era. It promised higher growth rates, higher investment rates, higher productivity rates and a trickle down of income from rich to poor. It has delivered none of these things. James Montier and Philip Pilkington, of the global investment firm GMO, say that the system which arose in the 1970s was characterised by four significant economic policies: the abandonment of full employment and its replacement with inflation targeting; an increase in the globalisation of the flows of people, capital and trade; a focus on shareholder maximisation rather than reinvestment and growth; and the pursuit of flexible labour markets and the disruption of trade unions and workers\u2019 organisations. To take just the last of these four pillars, the idea was that trade unions and minimum wages were impediments to an efficient labour market. Collective bargaining and statutory pay floors would result in workers being paid more than the market rate, with the result that unemployment would inevitably rise. Unpopulism decreed that the real value of the US minimum wage should be eroded. But unemployment is higher than it was when the minimum wage was worth more. Nor is there any correlation between trade union membership and unemployment. If anything, international comparisons suggest that those countries with higher trade union density have lower jobless rates. The countries that have higher minimum wages do not have higher unemployment rates. \u201cLabour market flexibility may sound appealing, but it is based on a theory that runs completely counter to all the evidence we have,\u201d Montier and Pilkington note. \u201cThe alternative theory suggests that labour market flexibility is by no means desirable as it results in an economy with a bias to stagnate that can only maintain high rates of employment and economic growth through debt-fuelled bubbles that inevitably blow up, leading to the economy tipping back into stagnation.\u201d This quest for ever-greater labour market flexibility has had some unexpected consequences. The bill in the UK for tax credits spiralled quickly once firms realised they could pay poverty wages and let the state pick up the bill. Access to a global pool of low-cost labour meant there was less of an incentive to invest in productivity-enhancing equipment. The abysmally low levels of productivity growth since the crisis have encouraged the belief that this is a recent phenomenon, but as Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, noted last week, the trend started in most advanced countries in the 1970s. \u201cCertainly, the productivity puzzle is not something which has emerged since the global financial crisis, though it seems to have amplified pre-existing trends,\u201d Haldane said. Bolshie trade unions certainly can\u2019t be blamed for Britain\u2019s lost productivity decade. The orthodox view in the 1970s was that attempts to make the UK more efficient were being thwarted by shop stewards who modeled themselves on Fred Kite, the character played by Peter Sellers in I\u2019m All Right Jack. Haldane puts the blame elsewhere: on poor management, which has left the UK with a big gap between frontier firms and a long tail of laggards. \u201cFirms which export have systematically higher levels of productivity than domestically oriented firms, on average by around a third. The same is true, even more dramatically, for foreign-owned firms. Their average productivity is twice that of domestically oriented firms.\u201d Populism is seen as irrational and reprehensible. It is neither. It seems entirely rational for the bottom 90% of the US population to question why they are getting only 2% of income gains. It hardly seems strange that workers in Britain should complain at the weakest decade for real wage growth since the Napoleonic wars. It has also become clear that ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing are merely sticking-plaster solutions. Populism stems from a sense that the economic system is not working, which it clearly isn\u2019t. In any other walk of life, a failed experiment results in change. Drugs that are supposed to provide miracle cures but are proved not to work are quickly abandoned. Businesses that insist on continuing to produce goods that consumers don\u2019t like go bust. That\u2019s how progress happens. The good news is that the casting around for new ideas has begun. Trump has advocated protectionism. Theresa May is consulting on an industrial strategy. Montier and Pilkington suggest a commitment to full employment, job guarantees, reindustrialisation and a stronger role for trade unions. The bad news is that time is running short. More and more people are noticing that the emperor has no clothes. Even if the polls are right this time and Marine Le Pen fails to win the French presidency, a full-scale political revolt is only another deep recession away. And that\u2019s easy enough to envisage. *Who Runs the Economy?; Palgrave Macmillan; edited by Robert Skidelsky and Nan Craig",

      "bodyText": "Wall Street\u2019s uncritical love affair with Donald Trump is over. For five months, traders have swallowed whole the idea that the president would swiftly get a package of tax cuts through a Republican-dominated Congress, giving a boost to growth and corporate profits in the process. Yet the first real test of Trump\u2019s ability to get lawmakers to do his bidding \u2013 the repeal of Obamacare \u2013 has been a disaster. The resistance on Capitol Hill has left the financial markets wondering when \u2013 and indeed whether \u2013 Trump will be able to deliver on his fiscal boost. This dose of reality is long overdue. The initial market reaction to Trump was negative but brief. Within 24 hours, Wall Street banished all its doubts and bet everything on the notion that the new man in the White House would lift the US economy out of its low-growth rut. Yet the initial doubts were valid. Trump lacks political experience and so does the team around him. The new president\u2019s bully-boy tactics have gone down badly on Capitol Hill and not just with Democrats. There are plenty of Republicans who find Trump and his methods odious. So, when it became clear last week that the repeal of Obamacare was not going to be legislative plain sailing, there was a predictable response on Wall Street: traders dumped shares. The relentless rise in the stock market since last November\u2019s election \u2013 the \u201cTrump bump\u201d \u2013 came to an abrupt halt. Up until now, the markets have taken on trust that the president will deliver on his election pledges. And after Trump\u2019s humiliating defeat in Congress on Friday, there is no doubt the mood has changed. That\u2019s not to say Wall Street is going to see all the gains of the past few months wiped out. But while shares could continue to rise, markets look certain to be a lot more volatile than they have been since November. There are three reasons for this. The first is that it may be some time before Trump gets agreement for tax cuts and infrastructure spending. It could easily be delayed until 2018. The second is that the president\u2019s ambitions may well have to be scaled down. Trump wants to use the savings from replacing Obamacare with something cheaper to fund his fiscal boost, but the Congressional Budget Office said last week that the impact on the budget deficit would be substantially less than originally estimated: a reduction of $150bn (\u00a3120bn), rather than $336bn. Fiscal conservatives in Congress will probably demand that Trump finds savings elsewhere. Finally, corporate profits are set to be squeezed by a combination of rising wages, higher interest rates and a stronger dollar. Trump\u2019s fiscal package \u2013 assuming it is approved \u2013 would reinforce those pressures, because stronger growth would lead to greater demand for labour. With unemployment below 5%, earnings are already starting to pick up. The Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, has raised interest rates twice since Trump\u2019s victory and will accelerate the pace of future increases if there is evidence that tax cuts are leading to wage inflation. Higher US interest rates at a time when no other major central bank \u2013 the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan or the Bank of England \u2013 is contemplating a move will make it more attractive for investors to hold dollars. The US currency will go up, making American exports dearer. Until now, the markets have focused solely on the upside from Trump\u2019s economic strategy \u2013 the stronger growth \u2013 without taking into consideration any of the potential downsides: higher inflation, dearer borrowing costs and an overvalued currency. Those downsides will become more evident as time goes by. It is too early to say that Wall Street has fallen out of love with Donald Trump. But the whirlwind romance is over. The relationship is entering a new and more difficult phase. We still need the Co-op Bank Hundreds of staff in high street banks have had a challenging few days. Royal Bank of Scotland announced that it was closing 158 branches, mostly NatWest sites, while the Co-operative Bank is battling to find a buyer amid fears about its future. Customers are shifting from banking in high-street branches to organising payments and direct debits on the internet and via smartphones, which is obviously putting pressure on traditional bricks-and-mortar sites. However, despite this, it is essential that a place is found for Co-op Bank. The bank has been riddled with problems since its disastrous takeover of Britannia building society in 2009, which saddled it with bad loans. It nearly collapsed in 2013 when a \u00a31.5bn black hole was discovered in its balance sheet, but was eventually bailed out through a deal with hedge funds. This bailout never looked like a permanent solution to Co-op Bank\u2019s problems, and so it has proved. The hedge funds have put the bank up for sale to raise more capital, with a deadline of mid-April for preliminary expressions of interest. Banking sources are now talking about the possibility of a break-up of Co-op Bank, and the Bank of England is understood to be monitoring the situation carefully. It would send an unfortunate message about British banking if the Co-op brand, which still maintains its ethical policy, were to disappear from the market. This ethical policy means, among other rules, that the bank does not invest in companies selling arms to oppressive regimes, does not support organisations offering payday loans, and has a strict approach to gambling. Despite its problems, the bank still has about 4 million customers and 105 branches. It remains a substantial player. Unfortunately, its financial problems are also substantial. It slumped to a \u00a3477m loss for 2016, its fifth consecutive year in the red. A rescue deal will not be easy, so the Co-op\u2019s owners and Bank of England must do all they can to help. A break-up would be bad for the industry. A bonus for the Pearson boss who got it wrong? Consider these facts about Pearson, world\u2019s biggest educational publisher and 47% owner of Penguin Random House books. \u2022 Last year it crashed \u00a32.6bn into the red, the biggest loss in its history. \u2022 It has issued five profit warnings in two years, the last of which, in January, wiped \u00a32bn off its value. \u2022 It has scrapped its profit targets and put its stake in Penguin up for sale in the hope of bolstering its balance sheet. Its net debt climbed from \u00a3654m to \u00a31.1bn last year. \u2022 4,000 jobs were axed last year and the company is \u201crebasing\u201d \u2013 which means cutting \u2013 its dividend payout to shareholders. Chief executive John Fallon said earlier this year: \u201cI am accountable ... I fully accept that accountability for the fact that we got two big calls wrong last year.\u201d So why has Fallon (paid \u00a36m in his four years in the job) just been handed a \u00a3345,000 bonus? On top of his \u00a3780,000 salary. Could be because executive pay is truly in la la land.",

Trump\u2019s fiscal package \u2013 assuming it is approved \u2013 would reinforce those pressures, because stronger growth would lead to greater demand for labour.</p> <p>With unemployment below 5%, earnings are already starting to pick up. The Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/15/us-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-to-1\" title=\"\">raised interest rates</a> twice since Trump\u2019s victory and will accelerate the pace of future increases if there is evidence that tax cuts are leading to wage inflation.</p> <p>Higher US interest rates at a time when no other major central bank \u2013 the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan or the Bank of England \u2013 is contemplating a move will make it more attractive for investors to hold dollars. The US currency will go up, making American exports dearer.</p> <p>Until now, the markets have focused solely on the upside from Trump\u2019s economic strategy \u2013 the stronger growth \u2013 without taking into consideration any of the potential downsides: higher inflation, dearer borrowing costs and an overvalued currency.</p> <p>Those downsides will become more evident as time goes by. It is too early to say that Wall Street has fallen out of love with Donald Trump. But the whirlwind romance is over. The relationship is entering a new and more difficult phase.</p> <h2>We still need the Co-op Bank</h2> <p>Hundreds of staff in high street banks have had a challenging few days. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/23/rbs-natwest-close-158-branches-customers-digital-job-losses\" title=\"\">Royal Bank of Scotland announced that it was closing 158 branches, mostly NatWest sites,</a> while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/23/rbs-natwest-close-158-branches-customers-digital-job-losses\" title=\"\">Co-operative Bank is battling to find a buyer amid fears about its future.</a></p> <p>Customers are shifting from banking in high-street branches to organising payments and direct debits on the internet and via smartphones, which is obviously putting pressure on traditional bricks-and-mortar sites. However, despite this, it is essential that a place is found for Co-op Bank.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/co-operative-group\" title=\"\">The bank has been riddled with problems</a> since its disastrous takeover of Britannia building society in 2009, which saddled it with bad loans. It nearly collapsed in 2013 when a \u00a31.5bn black hole was discovered in its balance sheet, but was eventually bailed out through a deal with hedge funds.</p> <p>This bailout never looked like a permanent solution to Co-op Bank\u2019s problems, and so it has proved. The hedge funds have put the bank up for sale to raise more capital, with a deadline of mid-April for preliminary expressions of interest. Banking sources are now talking about the possibility of a break-up of Co-op Bank, and the Bank of England is understood to be monitoring the situation carefully.</p> <p>It would send an unfortunate message about British banking if the Co-op brand, which still maintains its ethical policy, were to disappear from the market. This ethical policy means, among other rules, that the bank does not invest in companies selling arms to oppressive regimes, does not support organisations offering payday loans, and has a strict approach to gambling.</p> <p>Despite its problems, the bank still has about 4 million customers and 105 branches. It remains a substantial player. Unfortunately, its financial problems are also substantial. It slumped to a \u00a3477m loss for 2016, its fifth consecutive year in the red. A rescue deal will not be easy, so the Co-op\u2019s owners and Bank of England must do all they can to help. A break-up would be bad for the industry.</p> <h2>A bonus for the Pearson boss who got it wrong?</h2> <p>Consider these facts about Pearson, world\u2019s biggest educational publisher and 47% owner of Penguin Random House books.</p> <p>\u2022 Last year it crashed \u00a32.6bn into the red, the biggest loss in its history.</p> <p>\u2022 It has issued five profit warnings in two years, the last of which, in January, wiped \u00a32bn off its value.</p> <p>\u2022 It has scrapped its profit targets and put its stake in Penguin up for sale in the hope of bolstering its balance sheet. Its net debt climbed from \u00a3654m to \u00a31.1bn last year.</p> <p>\u2022 4,000 jobs were axed last year and the company is \u201crebasing\u201d \u2013 which means cutting \u2013 its dividend payout to shareholders.</p> <p>Chief executive John Fallon said earlier this year: \u201cI am accountable ...&#xa0;I fully accept that accountability for the fact that we got two big calls wrong last year.\u201d So why has Fallon (paid \u00a36m in his four years in the job) just been handed a \u00a3345,000 bonus? On top of his \u00a3780,000 salary. Could be because executive pay is truly in la la land.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Penalty rate cuts could cost the commonwealth budget $650m over four years, according to progressive thinktank the Australia Institute. Last month the Fair Work Commission decided to cut Sunday and public holiday penalty rates for workers covered by four awards (fast food, retail, pharmacy and hospitality). The impact on workers will be diverse, with different workers employed at different levels under each award, though not all workers will be affected. But the Australia Institute warns the cut in penalty rates will see personal income tax receipts decline \u2013 and a rise in claims for welfare payments \u2013 with the budgetary impact worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The institute\u2019s chief economist, Richard Denniss, has written a briefing note, seen by Guardian Australia, estimating the budgetary impact of the decision. He has modelled different scenarios, but his central scenario assumes 285,000 workers will lose an average of $2,744 a year from Sunday penalty rate cuts (the impact of lower penalty rates on public holidays has not been estimated). He assumes those workers will be in the 19% tax bracket (where they earn between $18,201 and $37,000 a year, and get taxed 19 cents for every dollar earned over $18,200). He choose the figure of 285,000 workers to match the government\u2019s lowest estimate. \u201cTo simplify the estimate of the impact of the FWC decision on the budget, the scenarios used assume that a smaller number of people experience all of the loss of income rather than the more realistic assumption that a larger group of people share some of the loss of income,\u201d Denniss says in the report. Denniss warns the Sunday penalty rate cuts will necessarily flow through to income tax receipts, with a reduction in tax revenue for the government worth $164.2m per year, or $656.8m over four years. He says the cutting of wages for low paid workers may also lead to a significant increase in welfare spending. He estimates if 20% of those 285,000 workers already receive welfare payments, the increase in welfare spending could be $78.2m a year. He said his estimates of the budgetary impact could be conservative because they did not include a number of possible economic effects, such as: state government payroll tax revenues declining with lower wage payments; a possible fall in consumer spending in line with the cut in disposable income and the related decline in GST revenue; and a fall in labour productivity. Regarding the argument that Sunday penalty rate cuts would boost employment, Denniss said it was possible the total wage bill would remain steady if there was a large increase in employment. \u201cIt is even theoretically possible that the wage bill might rise,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, not even the supporters of the cut in penalty rates have argued that lower wages will lead to a large increase in the number of shifts offered to workers.\u201d Peter Strong, the chief executive of the Council of Small Business Australia, has said it would be hard to estimate how many jobs would be created. \u201cThere will be more jobs. It might not be a lot, it might be 10,000. We don\u2019t know how many but we\u2019ll find out,\u201d he said last month. Jim Chalmers, the shadow minister for finance, told the ABC\u2019s Insiders on Sunday morning that he knew the Australia Institute was going to be releasing an analysis of the penalty rate cuts. \u201cThese penalty rate cuts won\u2019t just cost people up to $77 a week, they will also cost the budget hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cI think it speaks volumes about Malcolm Turnbull that he is so keen to attack the take-home pay of ordinary people around Australia, that he is prepared to smash the budget to do it,\u201d he said. Malcolm Turnbull has repeatedly reiterated the government\u2019s support for the independent FWC, saying it is \u201creckless\u201d for parliament to set penalty rates. He said he supported the FWC\u2019s decision because it supported small business. \u201cI have been very clear about that,\u201d he told radio 3AW interviewer Neil Mitchell this month. \u201cThe Fair Work Commission decided to back small business and we back small business. \u201cIt is important to remember this was not a decision from the government, it was an independent considered decision of the independent umpire of the Fair Work Commission, every member of which was appointed by a Labor government, three of who were appointed by Bill Shorten.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Confectionery firm Mars is shrinking the pack size of favourite sweets including Maltesers, M&amp;M\u2019s and Minstrels by up to 15% in the latest example of an industry trend that is shortchanging shoppers. It is the second time within a year that Mars has reduced the number of Maltesers in its sharing bags, which now weigh in at just 93g. Last autumn packs of Maltesers, billed as the lighter way to enjoy chocolate, shrank from 121g to 103g. The American food giant appears to have taken action across its bestselling brands: family packs of M&amp;M\u2019s are now 25g lighter at 140g, while bags of Minstrels and Revels are also almost 10% lighter. Prices are unchanged. Food manufacturers are either increasing prices or shrinking pack sizes \u2013 described as \u201cshrinkflation\u201d \u2013 as ingredient and transport costs rise and then presumably hoping that consumers don\u2019t notice the difference. Mars said: \u201cWe have been absorbing rising raw material and operational costs for some time, but the growing pressures mean that we can\u2019t keep things as they are. Reducing the size of our products is not a decision that we take easily.\u201d Steve Dresser, a supermarket analyst and author of industry blog Grocery Insight, said manufacturers were shrinking packs to preserve profit margins as they tried to hit the keen price points required for popular supermarket promotions. \u201cShoppers are losing out because they are getting less for their money,\u201d he said, adding that the trend was likely to continue. \u201cManufacturers are trying to protect their profit margins but it seems excessive to move a pack size down twice inside a year.\u201d Shrinkflation started during the last recession and in recent years chocolate-lovers have been regularly targeted. Last year Mondel\u0113z, the American food giant that owns Cadbury, caused a furore after it cut the weight of Toblerone bars by widening the gaps between the chocolate \u201cpeaks\u201d. More recently it raised the price of its Cadbury Freddo bars by 20% to 30p, despite maintaining the weight of the chocolate frogs at 18g. Nestl\u00e9 is also shrinking its Aero Mint bars from 120g to 100g to hold the price at \u00a31. After a benign period where inflation was close to zero, living costs started rising again last summer thanks to a combination of higher oil prices and the Brexit vote\u2019s blow to the value of the pound, which has made imports to the UK more expensive. Last week official figures showed inflation had jumped to 2.3% in February, the highest rate for more than three years. The bigger-than-expected rise will intensify fears over people\u2019s living standards being squeezed this year by higher living costs. While inflation has been going up, wage growth has been slowing, leaving households worse off. The squeeze means the major supermarkets are under pressure to keep prices low, creating tension with suppliers who want to pass on higher costs with the companies behind household brands such as Birds Eye fish fingers, Weetabix and Walkers crisps among those to have pushed through price rises in recent months. The slump in the pound\u2019s value since June is estimated to have increased the cost of raw materials, such as sugar, wheat and packaging, by between 5% and 10% for UK food manufacturers, according to a recent report by analysts at Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, the credit rating agency. Some of these price negotiations, which are usually carried out behind closed doors, have become high-profile public spats such as last year\u2019s \u201cMarmitegate\u201d standoff between Tesco and consumer brands giant Unilever over the manufacturer\u2019s plan to increase the price of a product range that spans Marmite, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice-cream and Comfort fabric softener. More recently Tesco has also removed a number of Heineken beer brands, including Amstel, Sol and Kingfisher, from its shelves after refusing to accept price increases the brewer blamed on Brexit and the budget.",

Nestl\u00e9 is also shrinking its Aero Mint bars from 120g to 100g to hold the price at \u00a31.</p> <p>After a benign period where inflation was close to zero, living costs started rising again last summer thanks to a combination of higher oil prices and the Brexit vote\u2019s blow to the value of the pound, which has made imports to the UK more expensive. Last week official figures showed inflation had jumped to 2.3% in February, the highest rate for more than three years. The bigger-than-expected rise will intensify fears over people\u2019s living standards being squeezed this year by higher living costs. While inflation has been going up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/15/uk-unemployment-rate-falls-joint-lowest-1975-wages-stall\" title=\"\">wage growth has been slowing</a>, leaving households worse off.</p> <p>The squeeze means the major supermarkets are under pressure to keep prices low, creating tension with suppliers who want to pass on higher costs with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/06/birds-eye-walkers-supermarkets-price-rise-brexit-vote-pound\" title=\"\">companies behind household brands such as Birds Eye fish fingers, Weetabix and Walkers crisps</a> among those to have pushed through price rises in recent months. The slump in the pound\u2019s value since June is estimated to have increased the cost of raw materials, such as sugar, wheat and packaging, by between 5% and 10% for UK food manufacturers, according to a recent report by analysts at Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, the credit rating agency.</p> <p>Some of these price negotiations, which are usually carried out behind closed doors, have become high-profile public spats such as last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\" title=\"\">\u201cMarmitegate\u201d standoff</a> between Tesco and consumer brands giant Unilever over the manufacturer\u2019s plan to increase the price of a product range that spans Marmite, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice-cream and Comfort fabric softener. More recently Tesco has also removed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/22/tesco-sol-amstel-tiger-brexit-heineken-price-increases\" title=\"\">number of Heineken beer brands</a>, including Amstel, Sol and Kingfisher, from its shelves after refusing to accept price increases the brewer blamed on Brexit and the budget.</p>",
