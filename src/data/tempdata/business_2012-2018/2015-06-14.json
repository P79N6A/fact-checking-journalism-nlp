      "bodyText": "Light-sabre wielding George Osborne says he is fighting for Britain\u2019s future generations. Central to his Mansion House speech was a warning that unless the state runs a budget surplus in normal times, a toxic legacy of debt awaits our children and grandchildren. The chancellor, who let it be known last week that he is a Star Wars fan who keeps several replicas of the Jedi weapons in his office, said that for the sake of future generations \u201cgovernments of the left as well as the right should run a budget surplus to bear down on debt\u201d. Addressing the assembled City grandees, Osborne was echoing comments by the prime minister, David Cameron, before the election, when he said parents and grandparents must \u201clook at the children you love\u201d and save them from a \u201clegacy of huge debts\u201d. The subtext of Osborne\u2019s speech was clear: a return to Labour\u2019s policy of running deficits \u2013 even those under the banner of \u201cborrow to invest\u201d \u2013 would undermine the public finances. Yet much of what Osborne does favours the old at the expense of the young. A look at five policy areas shows how: Osborne made the triple lock on state pension rises a cornerstone of the election. It guarantees the over 65s a 2.5% increase in the state pension regardless of inflation. Pensions rise in line with earnings or inflation if they are higher. This policy is not means-tested and has made pension costs the dominant factor in welfare spending. One in every \u00a32 of expenditure by the Department for Work and Pensions is spent on pensions. Education is being cut, hitting young people\u2019s prospects. While the schools budget is supposedly protected, more than 100,000 children are being taught in primary school classes larger than the statutory maximum. A cap on class sizes of 30 children has proved to be easily breached by hard-pressed schools and more than one in 20 infant school classes are above the ceiling. The next spending round will take another swipe at further and tertiary education across England and Wales. It is a fallacy of neo-liberal thinking that private companies and workers will train themselves for the modern workplace. Tertiary education needs to be expanded for post-16 and adult education and training. The environment must be a concern for future generations. That means investments in carbon-free energy generation and heat conservation. All the budgets in these areas have been cut, leaving private contractors to bid for a small number of high-profile projects. Carbon-free energy generation comes in the form of Hinkley point nuclear power station and the Swansea tidal lagoon, which cost twice and three times as much as solar power and onshore wind, neither of which are getting much government support. All the previous government attempts to get people excited about heat conservation flopped for lack of funds. In-work benefits are about to be cut again, with tax credits the prime victim. Research has shown that children are the biggest victims of these cuts. They also suffer the knock-on effects of cuts in mental health services, which have hurt funding for adult mental health more than any other area of health spending. More broadly, creating a budget surplus is more about protecting today\u2019s older taxpayers, many of whom already have the infrastructure they need to see out their days. Osborne scared boomers with Britain\u2019s escalating level of debt, which has doubled from around 40% of GDP in 2006 to 80%. But this level of borrowing by a national government is not bad in itself; it depends on who you borrow from and your ability to pay the interest. The UK\u2019s 80% is less than the Japanese (220%) and sits between France and Germany (96% and 71% respectively). The Japanese, like the Italians (who support a 120% debt to GDP ratio), borrow largely from their own savers. The UK has traditionally borrowed mostly from international investors, though today around a third of its debt is owned by the Bank of England. Much of it is long-dated (which means it comes up for renewal infrequently) and enjoys a historically low interest rate. This means there is virtually no threat to the UK\u2019s status as a safe haven. An experiment that proved this was run by Jonathan Portes, head of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research. He looked at the cost of UK debt financing before the election when markets, like most observers, expected a coalition government of some kind, most likely led by Labour. When a Tory victory was announced, the bond market, where government debt is bought and sold, was expected to leap for joy. It did not move \u2013 the conclusion being that the difference between a small deficit to fund investment under Labour and surpluses under the Tories left them untouched. Osborne failed to make the point that a government determined to save more than it spends is going to shrink. As a group of academic economists pointed out at the weekend, cutting back on spending to produce a surplus in the public finances shifts the burden of borrowing to businesses and households to maintain the current level of GDP. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects household borrowing to climb back above its former peak of about 170% of GDP by 2020, from a low of 135% after the 2008 crash. The Whitehall independent forecasting unit has made it clear that much of the UK\u2019s GDP growth throughout this period would evaporate were it not for this increase in borrowing. The question must be: how good is the surplus for the next generation if it has to borrow to pay for living expenses and invest when that could be done by the government \u2013 which can borrow at much lower rates and has plenty of jobs to do. Cutting public services to achieve a budget surplus will also have the effect of depressing growth below what it might have been if the government was to maintain a small deficit for investment. Lower growth will force the Bank of England to maintain low interest rates. At the moment, Threadneedle Street is expected to begin raising base rates next spring, from 0.5% to a maximum of 3% over maybe two to three years. Lower interest rates will encourage investment in risky assets and property in particular, where regulations are being weakened and taxes on ownership are low. This drives up property prices and creates an expensive asset only the richest young people can afford and a repeat of the 18-year cycle of property crashes Osborne pledged to eliminate. How can sowing the seeds of the next crash be of benefit to the young?",

      "bodyText": "Employment figures for April due later this week are expected to show the biggest rise in real wages growth for nearly eight years, according to new analysis. The data will give George Osborne a post-election lift after a weak first few months of the year that have shown manufacturing output slide backwards and the biggest boost to growth come from the City and the hotel and restaurant sectors. The Resolution Foundation thinktank predicted that average weekly earnings growth will have jumped to an annual rate of between 2.5% and 2.6% in February-April 2015, compared with 2.2% in January-March. Combined with inflation falling to -0.1% in April, it means real wages rose by 2.5-2.7%, their fastest rate since October 2007, the study found. But the wages bonanza could be shortlived if inflation, as is expected, continues to rise during the rest of the year to reach 1.7% next summer, driven by higher oil prices. The Bank of England is expected to start pushing up interest rates next spring in response to the improving economic outlook, but higher mortgage costs along with other rising prices will eat into real wage growth and disposable incomes. Analysts have speculated that households have so far refused to spend the gains from higher real wages for fear that they will prove shortlived. A survey found recently that people expected a pay rise of about 1%. A pay freeze in the public sector, which could be announced as early as next month\u2019s budget, will also depress average wages growth. Official figures on Wednesday are expected to show that growth in average earnings in the private sector increased to 3.0-3.2% in February-April, the highest real terms growth since September 2007, said the report. The return of respectable real wage growth is desperately needed, said Resolution, following the UK\u2019s six-year pay squeeze. It added that average weekly earnings are still lower than they were a decade ago and are about \u00a3100 a week lower than they might have been in the absence of the downturn. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThe good news is that real wages are now, finally, growing at a respectable rate by historical standards. The bad news is that this only appears to be happening because of inflation falling to unprecedented levels. \u201cNormally we\u2019d have expected wages to grow at this rate far earlier on in a recovery, so there is an enormous amount of ground to make up. We need to see real wage growth sustained at this rate year on year. \u201cUltimately, rising productivity will determine the strength of pay packets over the long-term, and tackling Britain\u2019s productivity problems should be the chancellor\u2019s top priority in the run-up to the budget.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last-ditch talks aimed at breaking the impasse between Athens and its international creditors have collapsed in acrimony with European Union officials dismissing Greece\u2019s latest reform package as incomplete in a step that pushes the country closer to leaving the eurozone. What had been billed as a last attempt to close the gap between Alexis Tsipras\u2019s anti-austerity government and the bodies keeping debt-stricken Greece afloat was halted late on Sunday after less than an hour of negotiations in Brussels. In a tersely worded statement, the European commission declared talks would resume when euro area finance ministers gather in Luxembourg on Thursday. The meeting could be decisive in determining the fate of a nation that is dependent on bailout funds from the EU and International Monetary Fund to avert default. \u201cWhile some progress was made, the talks did not succeed as there remains a significant gap between the plans of the Greek authorities and the joint requirements of the commission, European Central Bank and IMF,\u201d the statement said. In fiscal terms, the differences amounted to \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.45bn) a year in permanent budget savings. The gulf between the sides prompted a call from the IMF\u2019s chief economist for both sides to compromise further. Olivier Blanchard said Brussels should be prepared to delay more of Greece\u2019s debt repayments, accept only limited reforms and cut the interest applied to debt-relief loans, while Tsipras should offer further pension reforms and accept that some VAT exemptions must be dropped. \u201cOn the one hand, the Greek government has to offer truly credible measures to reach the lower target budget surplus and it has to show its commitment to the more limited set of reforms,\u201d Blanchard wrote in his economic blog. \u201cOn the other hand, the European creditors would have to agree to significant additional financing and to debt relief sufficient to maintain debt sustainability.\u201d The intervention by Blanchard late on Sunday will be widely seen as supportive of the Greek position, though with the sting for Athens in his call for pension reform, which Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, repeated on Saturday was a dealbreaker. With the future of Greece in the eurozone on the line as never before \u2013 and time now of the essence if Athens is to honour a \u20ac1.6bn debt repayment to the IMF on 30 June \u2013 the magnitude of the moment was not lost on Greek officials or the prime minister\u2019s radical left Syriza party. Yannis Dragasakis, the deputy prime minister who flew to Brussels to head talks, said Athens remained ready to conclude negotiations \u201cwith a mutually beneficial agreement\u201d, suggesting there was still room for compromise. Blaming foreign lenders for the breakdown in talks, he said the Greek government had submitted complementary proposals that \u201cfully cover\u201d the fiscal gap and the primary surplus \u2013 the two major sticking points between the two sides. Creditors, he said, had insisted on pension cuts and increases in VAT both worth 1% of GDP \u2013 or \u20ac3.6bn \u2013 to close the projected gap, measures that Athens regards as untenable for a population already pauperised by five years of biting austerity. It was the second economic reform package to be proposed by the Greek government and rejected by creditors in June. \u201cDespite the presence of the Greek delegation in Brussels, there was no response on the part of the institutions [European commission, ECB and IMF] for discussions at the same [political] level or authorisations that would permit a solution to the issues that remain open,\u201d Dragasakis said in a statement. Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece\u2019s chief negotiator, said it was clear \u201cthe opposite side did not have a mandate to negotiate\u201d. He told the Guardian in a text message: \u201cWe made huge efforts to meet them halfway but they insisted on both pension cuts and the increase in VAT on restaurants and would not accept closing the gap even partially via administrative measures to reduce tax evasion, even though this was a central plank of our electoral programme. Moreover, they told us bluntly they had no mandate to discuss a compromise! So much for negotiating.\u201d With developments taking such a dramatic turn, opposition parties urged Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the head of state, to call an emergency meeting of political leaders. \u201cThe country has to remain intact within Europe and this has to be understood by everyone,\u201d said the centrist party, To Potami. \u201cWe await a responsible reaction from the political leadership of the country.\u201d Negotiators, who included the young prime minister\u2019s closest confidant Nikos Pappas, were due to return to Greece on Sunday night. Failure to keep Greece in the euro, after years of arduous negotiations and two emergency bailouts totalling \u20ac240bn, would send it lurching into the unknown and mark a historic blow to the EU\u2019s most ambitious project. Greek officials flew to Brussels after Tsipras signalled he would soften his stance and accept painful compromises in return for promises to alleviate the country\u2019s staggering debt. Government sources had indicated that Athens was \u201cvery close\u201d to sealing a deal that would release more than \u20ac7bn in bailout funds the country now desperately needs to avoid defaulting on loans to the IMF and ECB over the summer. Creditors have refused to disburse financial assistance since August as both sides have wrangled over reforms. A gesture on the ever-contentious issue of Greek debt would also allow Tsipras to sell a deal to hardliners in Syriza, which was catapulted into power in January on a pledge to end five gruelling years of \u201cself-defeating\u201d austerity, and to Greeks at large. At more than \u20ac320bn, the equivalent of 180% of the country\u2019s entire economic output, Greece has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU with economists far and wide agreeing it is unsustainable. Following the breakdown in talks, leftwing militants implored the government not to concede on any measures that would entail \u201cthe extinction of the Greek people\u201d. Fears now abound that Greece could be heading for a Cyprus-style denouement with the ECB pulling the plug on the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) it has been drip-feeding Greek banks. The Frankfurt-based institution has come under growing pressure to make such a move in recent weeks. Indicative of the growing tensions between Athens and Berlin, the biggest contributor of Greece\u2019s bailout programme to date, Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s vice-chancellor and head of the country\u2019s Social Democratic party \u2013 who has long been seen as a friend of Greece \u2013 deplored the Greek government\u2019s negotiating tactics in an article for Monday\u2019s daily Bild newspaper. \u201cThe game theorists of the Greek government are in the process of gambling away the future of their country,\u201d he wrote in an excoriating critique of Varoufakis, whose academic expertise includes game theory. \u201cEurope and Germany will not let themselves be blackmailed. And we will not let the exaggerated electoral pledges of a partly communist government be paid for by German workers and their families.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Greek leader, Alexis Tsipras, has indicated that his negotiating team is nearing a compromise deal to avert Athens defaulting on its debts and being dumped out of the eurozone. After a weekend of intense talks with EU officials in Brussels, the final bid to keep Greece afloat will boil down to a tug-of-war deal over the country\u2019s staggering debt load, which Athens has insisted must be reduced as the price for further cuts in public spending. Politicians instructed by the radical left prime minister to fight Athens\u2019s corner, in what is being billed as the very last chance to cut a deal after five months of fruitless talks, will press for debt relief in exchange for concessions demanded by international creditors. \u201cIf we have a viable agreement, no matter how difficult the compromise, we will bear the burden,\u201d a statement on Sunday evening quoted the leader as telling his closest aides. Greece\u2019s bailout accord expires on 30 June with lenders at the European commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund setting a meeting of Eurogroup finance ministers on Thursday as the cut-off date for an agreement to be sealed. A deal \u2013 almost certain to be an extension of the current programme \u2013 would release more than \u20ac7bn (\u00a35bn) in bailout funds the country now desperately needs to avoid defaulting on loans to the IMF this month and the ECB over the summer. Creditors have refused to disburse loans since last August as both sides have wrangled over reforms. But a gesture on the ever-contentious issue of Athens\u2019s debt would also allow Tsipras to sell a deal to hardliners in his Syriza party \u2013 catapulted into power in January on a pledge to end five gruelling years of \u201cself-defeating\u201d austerity \u2013 and Greeks at large. At more than \u20ac320bn \u2013 the equivalent of 180% of the country\u2019s entire economic output \u2013 Greece has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU with economists far and wide agreeing it is unsustainable. Signalling that debt was now the name of the game, Tsipras\u2019s close ally and minister of state, Nikos Pappas, insisted that resolution of the vexed issue was now vital to reaching a viable agreement at a political level given that the medicine prescribed so far had failed so dramatically. In the five years since the debt crisis erupted \u2013 forcing the country out of international markets and the then socialist government to request emergency loans from the EU and IMF \u2013 the Greek economy has suffered a depression-era contraction as it has implemented painful budget cuts in exchange for the financial assistance. \u201cOur mission is Greece\u2019s decisive exit from crisis and the avoidance of adventures for all of Europe,\u201d Pappas told the Syriza party newspaper Avgi before flying to Brussels with the deputy prime minister, Yannis Dragasakis, and chief negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos, to participate in the talks. \u201cGreece has views, proposals, the determination, to work with [its] partners to get out of this destructive austerity with a viable debt and social cohesion. What is needed is a political solution.\u201d Time is now of the essence with EU officials sounding the alarm as never before. \u201cWe need a deal in the next few days,\u201d European commission vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis, told Germany\u2019s Die Welt newspaper. \u201cTime is not on our side.\u201d The German media said the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, a Grecophile who has long supported Athens, had been forced to warn of the risk of a potentially catastrophic departure from the euro when he met Tsipras in Brussels last week. At the centre of talks that top-ranking players from the EU, ECB and IMF will attend over the next two days is a new set of counter-proposals from the Greek government that aim to resolve the remaining differences the two sides have over pensions, tax and a primary surplus Athens is expected to achieve this year. On Sunday, Greek media reports suggested the government would row back on pension reform \u2013 vowing to overhaul its social security system \u2013 in return for the promise of debt forgiveness in the future. As a lender of last resort, the Washington-based IMF has long argued that Athens\u2019s debt mountain is unmanageable and has to be addressed \u2013 a stance that has created friction with eurozone creditors. In sharp contrast to any other single currency member, Greece saw a huge chunk of its debt held by private investors written off in 2012. A further writedown would almost certainly draw the ire of Germany, where taxpayers have footed the bulk of the \u20ac240bn financial lifeline. But Greek officials say there are other ways of lessening the burden, including extending maturities on debt now owed. With officials on both sides suffering from negotiation fatigue, the hope is that differences can be narrowed to the point that an interim agreement is sealed to keep bankruptcy at bay in the months ahead. Well-placed insiders say Athens is holding out for a nine-month extension that would give it time to prepare reforms. Lenders are leaning towards a four-month extension with significant reforms implemented in that time. Either scenario would simply kick the can that is the great Greek debt crisis down the road \u2013 but both would ensure the country that symbolises so much of Europe\u2019s spirit remains in the fold.",

      "bodyText": "David Bedford suffers from Parkinson\u2019s disease and can sometimes forget to take one of the five different pills he needs to keep the condition in check. Worse, when he makes half yearly visits to the hospital for a check-up, he cannot remember the details of his daily routine. Three years after he was diagnosed with the disease, he now uses a mobile phone app to remind him when to take the medication and to act as a diary of how his illness affects him. This attention to detail means that daily log is available before the short meetings he has with his consultant every six to nine months. The uMotif app on Bedford\u2019s phone is now being used by about 1,000 patients with 10 different conditions in the UK, the United States and Australia. The clinical information, such as how severe a tremor is or whether symptoms of their condition are getting worse, is sent in advance to doctors, saving time in consultations. \u201cI think that it is difficult for them [consultants] because they see you for a short time and you sometimes forget to mention something,\u201d Bedford says. Patients are presented with a series of measures on screen on which they can indicate how they are feeling on a particular day - whether they slept well, if they drank alcohol or smoked, if they feel more breathless or whether they feel dizzy. Each condition or treatment has a different set of criteria set down by the clinicians, says co-founder Bruce Hellman. If someone is in a rehabilitation programme after a heart attack, measuring breathlessness and dizziness will be particularly important whereas if someone has Parkinson\u2019s, the tremor in their hands is evaluated. With prostate cancer, how often the toilet is used is tracked, for example. The app can also be used by people who have been released from hospital following major surgery. Each condition monitored by the app has 10 different trackers from a total of 250. Another feature is the reminder to take medication and a diary to track moods. \u201cThis is self-reported symptom tracking. It can include how people are feeling in terms of their mood and their energy level. The key here is that you can combine this data with things like weight, blood pressure and daily activity,\u201d Hellman says. Those with Parkinson\u2019s disease may only see a doctor twice a year, says Hellman, and the app reduces the time spent asking how the patient is. Algorithms in the app cross-reference the relevant patient data to give an analysis to the consultant \u2013 such as matching a speed test where patients tap on the screen with the diary of when they are taking their medication to show the effects of not taking the dosage. In an attempt to examine the effects of weather and arthritis \u2013 much like the tale than bones ache more when it rains \u2013 analysts are cross-referencing pain and local weather data using GPS. The time saved with the consultants can translate to more efficient care and ultimately savings to health services, Hellman believes. Unlike areas such as retail and transport, health has been relatively slow to engage with the tech developments of recent years, resulting in inefficient healthcare plans for those out of hospital, he claims. \u201cIt is like the absolute dark ages in health. It is not like other areas where it is a year or two behind the rest of consumer internet. It is unbelievable,\u201d Hellman says. \u201cThere is very little to help the patient to better themselves and most people do want to be effective in their own recovery, but they are not being provided with the tools.\u201d So far, 19 projects with patients are live across various public and private healthcare providers, including a large number of NHS hospitals, with another 26 projects to follow in the summer. Among the conditions the technology is used for are kidney failure and hip surgery while additional systems for dementia, asthma and obesity are expected to follow soon. Where problems arise is when patients do not use smartphones, typically because of age or if they cannot afford one. Hellman says it is important to recognise the limits of the technology in that the data which is fed in by the patients is indicative and neither exact nor a diagnosis. The company is aiming to raise \u00a32m in its first major round of funding to expand. New technology like theirs can help address some of the funding gaps which exist in the health service, said Hellman. Patients who are more engaged with how they are cared for get better results from their treatment, he argues. \u201cIt is all about the relationship between patient and clinician. I think the big shift that we are seeing in health is what is happening in every other aspect of our daily life \u2013 you bank online, you shop online, you book your flights online,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that the future is a free download app connected with algorithms because that is dehumanising a lot of healthcare. I think where any technology is successful is where it improves the human connection.\u201d Self-diagnosis A tremor or shaking is one of the main symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Typically, medication is used to control this. The uMotif app uses sensors within a smartphone to gauge how severe a tremor is at any one time as part of its series of tests. By holding the phone flat on the palm of the hand, the app can detect the movement and gauges it into the database of information.

      "body": "<p>Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty excludes two essential trends from his analysis of the economy. In a speech this week, he said a bounce back from a lacklustre first three months of the year was on the cards. With the recovery will come a steady rise in wages that will last the rest of this year and into the next, resulting in the first of several interest rate rises next spring. </p> <p>It\u2019s not an outlandish statement. An interest rate rise in the first quarter of 2016 is what the market expects, too.</p> <p>Of course, McCafferty is more circumspect than that. Speaking in London, he said that he recognises things can change, as they have so often in the last few years to delay lifting rates from 0.5%. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s warning that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/12/standard-and-poors-cuts-uk-outlook-amid-eu-referendum-warning\">UK growth is threatened by the EU referendum</a> and a loss of business confidence is a case in point. Yet higher interest rates in less than a year qualifies as his central view, as it does the MPC\u2019s.</p> <p>So what is missing? First there is the recognition by the Office for Budget Responsibility that net migration in Britain has ballooned. Last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/net-migration-to-uk-higher-than-when-coalition-took-office\">net migration to the UK increased by 318,000</a>. This year could be the same or even higher. To give some sense of the rise, Britain is now a country of 64.1 million people, more than 4 million more than in 2004. </p> <p>The OBR acknowledges the latest data, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/11/ageing-uk-population-increase-strain-government-spending-obr-warns\">adopts the long run trend in its forecasts to the 2060s</a>. Discounting recent bumper migration totals, the longer-term trend is much lower, though it is rising and by a large percentage. In its report on Wednesday, it said the upward trend has forced it to abandon the standard 105,000 a year increase in favour of a higher 165,000 a year.</p> <p>Using this figure, the working age population will, on a conservative estimate, be at least 500,000 higher by the next election.</p> <p>This trend undermines McCafferty\u2019s assertion that spare capacity in the economy is a fixed entity and will soon be almost entirely be used up, pushing wages up \u201cmarkedly\u201d. He estimates the output gap at 0.5%.

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty excludes two essential trends from his analysis of the economy. In a speech this week, he said a bounce back from a lacklustre first three months of the year was on the cards. With the recovery will come a steady rise in wages that will last the rest of this year and into the next, resulting in the first of several interest rate rises next spring. It\u2019s not an outlandish statement. An interest rate rise in the first quarter of 2016 is what the market expects, too. Of course, McCafferty is more circumspect than that. Speaking in London, he said that he recognises things can change, as they have so often in the last few years to delay lifting rates from 0.5%. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s warning that UK growth is threatened by the EU referendum and a loss of business confidence is a case in point. Yet higher interest rates in less than a year qualifies as his central view, as it does the MPC\u2019s. So what is missing? First there is the recognition by the Office for Budget Responsibility that net migration in Britain has ballooned. Last year, net migration to the UK increased by 318,000. This year could be the same or even higher. To give some sense of the rise, Britain is now a country of 64.1 million people, more than 4 million more than in 2004. The OBR acknowledges the latest data, and adopts the long run trend in its forecasts to the 2060s. Discounting recent bumper migration totals, the longer-term trend is much lower, though it is rising and by a large percentage. In its report on Wednesday, it said the upward trend has forced it to abandon the standard 105,000 a year increase in favour of a higher 165,000 a year. Using this figure, the working age population will, on a conservative estimate, be at least 500,000 higher by the next election. This trend undermines McCafferty\u2019s assertion that spare capacity in the economy is a fixed entity and will soon be almost entirely be used up, pushing wages up \u201cmarkedly\u201d. He estimates the output gap at 0.5%. This is based on surveys showing workers want their employers to give them more hours and that the long run unemployment rate is 5% and not the current 5.5%. By the end of the year most people will be working all the hours they want and unemployment will have fallen further, forcing employers to hike wages. This might be true of the current working age population. Is it true when there are 100,000 or more people joining the workforce each year? Surely, they will keep wages in check. Next is the chancellor\u2019s new mission to cut public services and welfare payments to generate year-on-year budget surpluses. Set aside for a minute the OBR view that his target is ambitious. Let\u2019s take Osborne at his word and look at the broader effect on the economy. Without any doubt it will prove a drag on growth. It is always difficult to estimate, but cutting state spending, whatever its proponents claim as the long term benefits, is going to hit consumption over the next year or three. In the last year the economy has slowed, primarily in response to a clampdown by regulators on previously rampant property lending. It sapped consumer confidence, which has bounced back, but not with any conviction. The chancellor wants consumers to spend their wages while the government steps back, something they appear unwilling to do. Sidestepping these issues, the Bank of England still expects growth to pick up and wages to continue outstripping inflation by a large margin. It may be this secondary effect that eludes the UK and keeps interest rates at or near its historic low for a very long time.",

By Friday, as both sides scrambled to fix up a fresh round of talks for this weekend after the International Monetary Fund\u2019s negotiators flew home in frustration, it appeared that European officials had been discussing how they might manage a Greek default. It\u2019s hard not to be mesmerised by the day-to-day drama of walkouts, public posturing and political intrigue, which may finally reach its conclusion in the coming days. But as Greece hurtles towards the brink, it\u2019s worth asking how we got here. The euro was always meant to be a political project above all \u2013 lifting Europe\u2019s stragglers up to the living standards of the rest and, in doing so,k cementing the political ties between Athens and Antwerp, Madrid and Munich. Joining the club was a badge of political sophistication, as well as economic advancement; and clubbing together, it was thought, would help the European economy to act as a counterweight to the might of the dollar and the hegemony of US-style market capitalism. It\u2019s a measure of how far the eurozone has departed from that founding mythology that the IMF, the fountainhead of economic neoliberalism, has sometimes found itself having to act as a moderating force as the bailout talks have dragged on in recent weeks. It appears to have been the IMF that has insisted on putting the possibility of debt write-offs on the table, for example, when European negotiators were unwilling to countenance it. Since 2010, Europe\u2019s powerful \u201ccore\u201d countries \u2013 led by Germany \u2013 have forced Greece and the other bailed-out countries to swallow a hefty dose of neoliberal orthodoxy: deep spending cuts, deregulation of a string of markets, pension reforms, the dismantling of collective bargaining. Private sector bondholders, many of them German banks who lent hand over fist to Greece in the runup to the crisis, were largely made good; workers have suffered wage cuts as the government struggles to make repayments to its bailout creditors. And all the while, Greece\u2019s plight has continued to worsen. Since the first \u201crescue\u201d was agreed in May 2010, the Greek economy has contracted by an extraordinary 20% \u2013 an economic collapse on a scale unthinkable in an advanced economy since the days of the Great Depression \u2013 at the behest, and under the supervision, of its eurozone partners. Meanwhile, unemployment has more than doubled, rising from 12% to 26%. As default looms, a fair observer must admit that neither side in the slow-motion car crash has acquitted itself well. Alexis Tsipras and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, have spent too much time grandstanding and writing spiky op-eds in the international press (or chatting to Vladimir Putin) when they should have been engaged in the hard graft of technical negotiations. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has sometimes seemed more interested in impugning the trustworthiness of his Greek interlocutors than trying to find common ground and cement a deal. It would be quite understandable \u2013 though deeply risky \u2013 if Athens decides that enough is enough: without some element of debt forgiveness it will be hard to see any deal as financially sustainable, and its \u201cred lines\u201d on politically toxic pension reform appear to be under threat. The sharp devaluation that would follow if the country readopted the drachma would at least give trade and tourism a boost. But even if Greece is snatched from the brink of bankruptcy and kept in the euro in the coming days, the cause of promoting solidarity between eurozone nations has been long forgotten. It would hardly be surprising if the citizens of Greece \u2013 and, over time, perhaps those of other hard-pressed eurozone economies \u2013 decided they\u2019d rather take their chances in the tough world of global markets alone. \u2018Irresponsibility\u2019 is too mild a term: traders did $3tn of damage The rigging of Libor, we now know, took place with alacrity across the City. \u201cI\u2019m like a whore\u2019s drawers,\u201d one trader quipped as he moved interest rates up and down as favours for friends. There were offers of lunch, curries and bottles of champagne for playing along. The same goes for foreign exchange. Traders at various banks discuss trading patterns in chatrooms, calling themselves \u201cthe players\u201d, \u201cthe 3 musketeers\u201d, \u201c1 team, 1 dream\u201d, and \u201cthe A-team\u201d. As Bank of England governor Mark Carney put it last week: \u201cUnethical behaviour went unchecked, proliferated and eventually became the norm. Too many participants neither felt responsible for the system nor recognised the full impact of their actions.\u201d His answer is to put these fixed income, currency and commodities markets \u2013 Ficc, as they are known in the Square Mile \u2013 under much closer scrutiny. Informal codes of practice that were ignored are to be replaced with far tougher procedures. Tens of thousands of fund managers, traders and interdealer brokers will be brought within the ambit of a new Senior Managers\u2019 Regime, which comes into force next March and make individuals responsible for their actions. A new market standards board will be created to police new, tougher codes of conduct. Criminal offences should be extended to rigging and abusing these Ficc markets (not just stock markets) and jail terms extended from seven to 10 years. But will the prospect of more time behind bars act as a deterrent? Not if convictions remain as rare as they are currently. But Carney spelled out succinctly why the \u201cage of irresponsibility\u201d has to end. He rattled off statistics showing that fines of around $150bn have been imposed on major banks in the seven years since the banking crisis. These fines had resulted in the global economy being deprived of $3tn of potential growth-boosting credit. That is something that the Libor riggers and forex manipulators cannot joke about. Scots are right to wonder where the oil money went The Office for Budget Responsibility dealt a blow to the Scottish National party\u2019s desire for full fiscal autonomy last week. By warning that North Sea oil and gas fields could generate total tax revenues of just \u00a32bn between 2020 and 2041, it sent a signal that Scotland would struggle to go it alone as an independent nation. The economic consequences of these estimates are clear, but observers should beware of making assumptions about the political ones. Voters in Scotland, and the rest of the UK, have every right to ask what has happened to all the money made from the North Sea. Unlike in Norway, there is no oil-backed sovereign wealth fund to pay for infrastructure and rainy days. It has all gone. Supporters of independence might see this mismanagement of a national resource as further evidence for giving Scotland control of its own economic affairs.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The inquest on Labour\u2019s electoral defeat will run and run, and the recriminations will no doubt persist throughout the party\u2019s inordinately long timetable for selecting a new leader. But there is a limit to which candidates should surrender to the Big Lie that George Osborne, more than anyone else, has managed to get away with. Take a report in the Times\u2019s recent \u201cinvestigation\u201d into Labour\u2019s \u201cdisastrous campaign\u201d. We are told that \u201cas early as 2010, Labour\u2019s pollsters sent a memo saying the party should argue \u2018the deficit is the number one challenge facing the country\u2019 and back \u2018tough spending cuts\u2019.\u201d The truth is that the deficit was not the problem: it was the solution. What the much-maligned government of Gordon Brown did was to recognise this, and act accordingly. One of the principal beneficiaries of this sensible Keynesian response was George Osborne, who inherited the economy in which the prospect of a 1930s depression had been warded off. He proceeded to make wholly misleading analogies with the state of the benighted Greek economy and embark on a programme of austerity which Ed Balls rightly warned would stop the recovery in its tracks. It is not for me to join the chorus maintaining that Labour should have admitted that all the extra spending on schools and hospitals was a mistake. The most serious mistake was not to get across with sufficient emphasis that by far the biggest contribution to a rise in public sector debt was caused by the banking crisis. Moreover, as my old mentor, the Nobel laureate Professor Amartya Sen, pointed out recently in a lecture reproduced in the New Statesman: \u201cEven if we want to reduce public debt quickly, austerity is not a particularly effective way of achieving this (which the European and British experiences confirm)\u201d. It is tragic that the Big Lie was not dealt with by Ed Miliband. Apparently he dismissed advice from Alastair Campbell, way back, that he should commission an independent report, by a respected figure, on Labour\u2019s past spending plans \u2013 plans that had been supported at the time by Messrs Cameron and Osborne. Even the Times reflects that such a report \u201cwould almost certainly have cleared Labour of blame, with a minor dispute around whether the party could have spent less in 2007\u201d. But the deficit story was allowed to run and run, and poor Miliband failed to scotch it on at least two prominent occasions. Yet, as Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the Treasury\u2019s top civil servant, has stated: \u201cThe 2008 crisis was a banking crisis pure and simple.\u201d That crisis was a cataclysm. It demanded a short-term approach to warding off catastrophic consequences, and a long-term approach to reducing a national debt that, notwithstanding the impact of the crisis, remained, as Sen emphasises, remarkably low by historical standards. As he says, put quite simply, for reducing the debt, \u201cwe need economic growth; and austerity, as Keynes noted, is essentially anti-growth\u201d. But such wisdom will cut no ice with a cocky chancellor who can hardly believe his luck at how Labour played into his hands. By winning a mere 37% of votes cast, he thinks he now has the support of the country for a renewal of austerity. He plans a budget which \u2013 by not treating capital expenditure as something to be financed over the lifetime of the project, but from a single year\u2019s revenue \u2013 is going to place huge burdens on the public services. Just brace yourselves for the real cuts. Osborne\u2019s first austerity programme brought us reductions in capital expenditure when borrowing costs for much-needed projects were negligible. In the past year or so, he has finally woken up to this country\u2019s infrastructure problems and \u2013 who knows? \u2013 before long may even find himself reinventing the National Economic Development Office. As Sen points out, had the British public been frightened after the second world war by the debt ratio, which was more than twice what it has been in recent years, \u201cthe NHS would never have been born, and the great experiment of having a welfare state in Europe (from which the whole world from China, Korea and Singapore to Brazil and Mexico would learn) would not have found a foothold\u201d. We were helped after the war by a loan from the US (mainly) and Canada, which was finally paid off in 2006. And a war loan dating from the first world war was finally redeemed earlier this year! Osborne has rightly attracted ridicule, even from friendly commentators, for his absurd plan to try to bind all future governments to a law that demands not just budget balance but budget surpluses during \u201cnormal times\u201d \u2013 a phrase that opens up great scope for debate. Apart from anything else, it is evident from the frequent revisions to statistics, and therefore analysis made by the Office for National Statistics and the Office for Budget Responsibility, that it is often not obvious at the time whether one is indeed living in \u201cnormal times\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The inquest on Labour\u2019s electoral defeat will run and run, and the recriminations will no doubt persist throughout the party\u2019s inordinately long timetable for selecting a new leader. But there is a limit to which candidates should surrender to the Big Lie that George Osborne, more than anyone else, has managed to get away with.</p> <p>Take a report in the <em>Times</em>\u2019s recent \u201cinvestigation\u201d into Labour\u2019s \u201cdisastrous campaign\u201d. We are told that \u201cas early as 2010, Labour\u2019s pollsters sent a memo saying the party should argue \u2018the deficit is the number one challenge facing the country\u2019 and back \u2018tough spending cuts\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The truth is that the deficit was not the problem: it was the solution. What the much-maligned government of Gordon Brown did was to recognise this, and act accordingly. One of the principal beneficiaries of this sensible Keynesian response was George Osborne, who inherited the economy in which the prospect of a 1930s depression had been warded off. He proceeded to make wholly misleading analogies with the state of the benighted Greek economy and embark on a programme of austerity which Ed Balls rightly warned would stop the recovery in its tracks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>The truth is that the deficit was not the problem: it was the solution</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is not for me to join the chorus maintaining that Labour should have admitted that all the extra spending on schools and hospitals was a mistake. The most serious mistake was not to get across with sufficient emphasis that by far the biggest contribution to a rise in public sector debt was caused by the banking crisis. Moreover, as my old mentor, the Nobel laureate Professor Amartya Sen, pointed out recently <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/06/amartya-sen-economic-consequences-austerity\" title=\"\">in a lecture reproduced in the <em>New Statesman</em></a>: \u201cEven if we want to reduce public debt quickly, austerity is not a particularly effective way of achieving this (which the European and British experiences confirm)\u201d.</p> <p>It is tragic that the Big Lie was not dealt with by Ed Miliband. Apparently he dismissed advice from Alastair Campbell, way back, that he should commission an independent report, by a respected figure, on Labour\u2019s past spending plans \u2013 plans that had been supported at the time by Messrs Cameron and Osborne. Even the <em>Times</em> reflects that such a report \u201cwould almost certainly have cleared Labour of blame, with a minor dispute around whether the party could have spent less in 2007\u201d.</p> <p>But the deficit story was allowed to run and run, and poor Miliband failed to scotch it on at least two prominent occasions. Yet, as Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the Treasury\u2019s top civil servant, has stated: \u201cThe 2008 crisis was a banking crisis pure and simple.\u201d</p> <p>That crisis was a cataclysm. It demanded a short-term approach to warding off catastrophic consequences, and a long-term approach to reducing a national debt that, notwithstanding the impact of the crisis, remained, as Sen emphasises, remarkably low by historical standards. As he says, put quite simply, for reducing the debt, \u201cwe need economic growth; and austerity, as Keynes noted, is essentially anti-growth\u201d.</p> <p>But such wisdom will cut no ice with a cocky chancellor who can hardly believe his luck at how Labour played into his hands. By winning a mere 37% of votes cast, he thinks he now has the support of the country for a renewal of austerity. He plans a budget which \u2013 by not treating capital expenditure as something to be financed over the lifetime of the project, but from a single year\u2019s revenue \u2013 is going to place huge burdens on the public services. Just brace yourselves for the real cuts.</p> <p>Osborne\u2019s first austerity programme brought us reductions in capital expenditure when borrowing costs for much-needed projects were negligible. In the past year or so, he has finally woken up to this country\u2019s infrastructure problems and \u2013 who knows? \u2013 before long may even find himself reinventing the National Economic Development Office.</p> <p>As Sen points out, had the British public been frightened after the second world war by the debt ratio, which was more than twice what it has been in recent years, \u201cthe NHS would never have been born, and the great experiment of having a welfare state in Europe (from which the whole world from China, Korea and Singapore to Brazil and Mexico would learn) would not have found a foothold\u201d.</p> <p>We were helped after the war by a loan from the US (mainly) and Canada, which was finally paid off in 2006. And a war loan dating from the first world war was finally redeemed earlier this&#xa0;year!</p> <p>Osborne has rightly attracted ridicule, even from friendly commentators, for his absurd plan to try to bind all future governments to a law that demands not just budget balance but budget surpluses during \u201cnormal times\u201d \u2013 a phrase that opens up great scope for debate. Apart from anything else, it is evident from the frequent revisions to statistics, and therefore analysis made by the Office for National Statistics and the Office for Budget Responsibility, that it is often not obvious at the time whether one is indeed living in \u201cnormal times\u201d.</p> <p>Rather like his distinguished predecessor, Lord Lawson, Osborne has become obsessed by \u201crules\u201d. But as one of Macpherson\u2019s distinguished predecessors, Sir Douglas Allen, used to say, what matters is not budget balance, let alone budget surplus, but a balanced economy. That is not what is on offer from the present chancellor.</p>",
