      "bodyText": "Manufacturers are demanding that the government provide urgent clarity on the future of EU workers\u2019 rights, warning they will face shortages of skilled staff if they cannot recruit from Europe after Brexit. EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said a quarter of the firms it represents had seen job applications from the EU fall and 16% had seen more European workers quit since the 2016 referendum. With a majority relying on EU staff due to a lack of skilled UK applicants, manufacturers warned that uncertainty over recruitment would choke off growth and damage the British economy. The reciprocal rights of EU and UK workers is one of the core questions in the Brexit negotiations, with the prime minister having confirmed that freedom of movement must be limited, despite business fears and cabinet objections. However, the government has indicated it will seek a transitional period following the article 50 deadline of March 2019. A report published by EEF says that while manufacturers are looking to bring in more apprenticeships and training, these can only be long-term solutions, with 11% of staff now coming from the EU and many vacancies attracting no UK applicants. It warned that skills shortages would worsen should post-Brexit restrictions mean a cap on EU staff as well as non-EU staff employed by firms, with three quarters of manufacturers surveyed saying they were already struggling to fill roles. Tim Thomas, EEF director of employment and skills, said: \u201cPreventing industry from being able to recruit the best skilled workers from the EU could stifle growth, damage British industry and the UK economy as a whole. \u201cAs a priority the government should clarify the reciprocal rights of EU nationals in the UK and British nationals currently working in other EU member states. Skills shortages are endemic in manufacturing and engineering, and any points-based type system would choke off the skills needed by this sector.\u201d EEF has urged that skilled European workers should have the right to work in the UK for up to five years and then apply for permanent residency, and that EU nationals should continue to be able to come to study in the UK and seek ensuing employment here. The manufacturers also urged that rules be relaxed again to allow non-EU students to stay after graduation for two years to seek skilled employment. The EEF survey follows other warnings of a \u201cbrain drain\u201d after Brexit, with a KPMG survey suggesting that almost a million highly skilled EU citizens were planning to leave the UK. The figures showed that the intention to leave was most prevalent among the best qualified and highest paid EU nationals living in the UK, including half of those with postgraduate qualifications. Meanwhile, German industrialists have criticised the UK government\u2019s negotiating stance. \u201cThe British government is lacking a clear direction of travel,\u201d said Dieter Kempf, head of the German employers\u2019 association BDI. \u201cIn spite of British cabinet members declaring a united front, there is no discernible coordinated line on behalf of the government. \u201cThese are poor preconditions for the third round of negotiations. Noteworthy progress can hardly be expected. British proposals for managing customs come with disproportionately high amount of additional bureaucracy. \u201cFor businesses these ideas are impractical. The United Kingdom has at last got to deliver unambiguous statements on the modalities of leaving [the European Union].\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The combined pension deficit of FTSE 350 companies has risen to \u00a362bn, accounting for 70% of their profits. The deficit as a proportion of profits recorded for 2016 is higher than at any time since the financial crisis, following a \u00a312bn rise since 2015. The 25% increase came in a second year of comparatively low profit for UK publicly listed companies. The deficit is the gap between the expected liabilities of pension commitments and the funds that companies hold to pay for pensions. While many have set aside billions in recent years, a trend towards rising life expectancy, combined with lower expectations for returns on investment, has put more pressure on pension schemes and seen the deficit grow. Actuaries have warned that even a slight fall in bond yields would see the pension deficit of the plcs outstrip their aggregate profits by 2019. The figures, in a report from the actuarial consultancy Barnett Waddingham, show the deficit has risen sharply as a proportion of profits in the past five years, from 25% of the \u00a3214bn pre-tax profits of the FTSE 350 in 2011. Even in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009, the deficit was lower at 60%. For 21 plcs, the pensions shortfall is more than 10% of their value, which Barnett Waddingham described as alarming. However, the actuaries said recent data suggesting years of austerity had seen gains in UK life expectancy grind to a halt could provide \u201cwelcome respite for companies\u201d. It showed that after a century in which the rate of increase in life expectancy had accelerated, the average age of death was levelling off at 79 for men and 83 for women. An updated financial assessment to reflect the diminishing life prospects of retired UK employees would cut the aggregate liabilities of FTSE 350 companies by about \u00a310bn, they said. Nick Griggs of Barnett Waddingham said: \u201cComparing the pension deficit to profits is a simplification, but it helps to put the scale of the challenge into context. Unless companies are profitable over the long term, they can\u2019t generate enough cash to meet their liabilities, including the pension deficit.\u201d However, Griggs said, as long as \u201clongevity increases do not provide any nasty surprises\u201d, the deficit problem could be solved with higher returns and rises in long-term interest rates. \u201cThe deficit is essentially the difference between two much bigger numbers, and a few gentle economic triggers could completely change the picture,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why many companies are not rushing to clear deficits quickly with additional cash contributions.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Companies that are publicly listed in the UK will be obliged to publish the pay ratio between their chief executive and their average British worker under government plans. The proposals, which will be announced on Tuesday and will come into force by next June, will also aim to give workers a voice at boardroom level. But the plans fall short of the corporate governance revolution promised last year by Theresa May. A new corporate governance code will include stipulations for listed companies to assign a non-executive director to represent employees, create an employee advisory council or nominate a director from the workforce. However, this would be under a so-called \u201ccomply or explain\u201d basis, meaning companies could opt not to undertake any of the measures if they explain why they are not doing so. That represents a substantial change from May\u2019s original pledge on the subject. When running for the leadership of the Conservative party last year she suggested she would oblige big companies to have their workforce represented on boards. But in a speech to the business lobby group the CBI later in the year, May signalled she would backtrack on the idea that this should be mandatory, saying it was \u201ca question of finding the model that works\u201d. Listed companies which have faced regular shareholder opposition over top-level pay will also be included on a new public register. There will also be a voluntary set of guidelines for large private companies. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy billed the changes as a \u201cworld-leading package of corporate governance reforms\u201d and the package has won the support of the Institute of Directors (IoD) and the CBI. The requirement will mean that about 900 large listed companies will need to annually publish and justify the ratio of pay between their chief executive and the firm\u2019s average UK worker, BEIS said. But the plans were criticised by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and trade unions. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, described them as \u201ca feeble proposal, spelling business as usual for boardrooms across Britain\u201d. She said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s pledge to put workers on company boards has been watered down beyond all recognition. This now amounts to little more than a box-ticking exercise.\u201d During the general election Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, won support by focusing heavily on pay disparities, suggesting a possible pay cap that would limit the highest paid member of staff to 20 times the average worker for companies with public sector contracts. On Monday MonRebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, described the government\u2019s proposals as \u201cjust more crony capitalism\u201d and questioned why the register of companies that face shareholder revolts would be maintained by the Investment Association, a City trade body. She said: \u201cThe Tory plan is a fraud, watering down a promise to increase workers\u2019 voices to a lone representative on the board of directors or a separate employee advisory council. Each of these will be easily outvoted or ignored. \u201cThe Tories seem to believe fixing Britain\u2019s broken system of corporate governance, which not only leads to scandals like BHS, extreme executive pay, but also growing inequality and stagnating wages, is just a matter of changing one or two nameplates around the boardroom table.\u201d Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader and former business secretary, said the executive pay register would contribute little because the information was already available and that the new code would be voluntary for large private companies. \u201cThe overblown rhetoric from Theresa May is completely at odds with the weakness of the new rules,\u201d he said. The plans will also oblige large listed companies \u201cto publicly explain how their directors take employees\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 interests into account\u201d and to make public policies on responsible business. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said: \u201cOne of Britain\u2019s biggest assets in competing in the global economy is our deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place in which to do business. Our legal system, our framework of company law and our standards of corporate governance have long been admired around the world. \u201cWe have maintained such a reputation by keeping our corporate governance framework under review. Today\u2019s reforms will build on our strong reputation and ensure our largest companies are more transparent and accountable to their employees and shareholders.\u201d Stephen Martin, the head of the IoD, said his organisation welcomed \u201cthe pragmatic approach the government is taking to improve how company boards work\u201d. He said Clark was \u201ctaking a sensible approach on giving workers a bigger say, by allowing companies to choose the best way to implement the new rules\u201d. Paul Drechsler, the CBI president, said: \u201cWe know that how companies act and behave determines the way people think about business. Companies take this seriously and we look forward to working closely with the government to ensure the UK maintains its reputation as a global leader in this field and as a primary location for international investment. \u201cThe CBI is very clear that the unacceptable behaviour of a few does not reflect the high standards and responsible behaviour of the vast majority of companies.\u201d",

But the plans fall short of the corporate governance revolution promised last year by Theresa May.</p> <p>A new corporate governance code will include stipulations for listed companies to assign a non-executive director to represent employees, create an employee advisory council or nominate a director from the workforce. </p> <p>However, this would be under a so-called \u201ccomply or explain\u201d basis, meaning companies could opt not to undertake any of the measures if they explain why they are not doing so.</p> <p>That represents a substantial change from May\u2019s original pledge on the subject. When running for the leadership of the Conservative party last year she suggested she would oblige big companies to have their workforce represented on boards. But in a speech to the business lobby group the CBI later in the year, May signalled she would backtrack on the idea that this should be mandatory, saying it was \u201ca question of finding the model that works\u201d.</p> <p>Listed companies which have faced regular shareholder opposition over top-level pay will also be included on a new public register. There will also be a voluntary set of guidelines for large private companies.</p> <p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy billed the changes as a \u201cworld-leading package of corporate governance reforms\u201d and the package has won the support of the Institute of Directors (IoD) and the CBI.</p> <p>The requirement will mean that about 900 large listed companies will need to annually publish and justify the ratio of pay between their chief executive and the firm\u2019s average UK worker, BEIS said.</p> <p>But the plans were criticised by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and trade unions. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, described them as \u201ca feeble proposal, spelling business as usual for boardrooms across Britain\u201d.<br></p> <p>She said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s pledge to put workers on company boards has been watered down beyond all recognition. This now amounts to little more than a box-ticking exercise.\u201d</p> <p>During the general election Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, won support by focusing heavily on pay disparities, suggesting a possible pay cap that would limit the highest paid member of staff to 20 times the average worker for companies with public sector contracts.</p> <p>On Monday MonRebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, described the government\u2019s proposals as \u201cjust more crony capitalism\u201d and questioned why the register of companies that face shareholder revolts would be maintained by the Investment Association, a City trade body. She said: \u201cThe Tory plan is a fraud, watering down a promise to increase workers\u2019 voices to a lone representative on the board of directors or a separate employee advisory council. Each of these will be easily outvoted or ignored.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tories seem to believe fixing Britain\u2019s broken system of corporate governance, which not only leads to scandals like BHS, extreme executive pay, but also growing inequality and stagnating wages, is just a matter of changing one or two nameplates around the boardroom table.\u201d</p> <p>Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader and former business secretary, said the executive pay register would contribute little because the information was already available and that the new code would be voluntary for large private companies. \u201cThe overblown rhetoric from Theresa May is completely at odds with the weakness of the new rules,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The plans will also oblige large listed companies \u201cto publicly explain how their directors take employees\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 interests into account\u201d and to make public policies on responsible business.</p> <p>Greg Clark, the business secretary, said: \u201cOne of Britain\u2019s biggest assets in competing in the global economy is our deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place in which to do business. Our legal system, our framework of company law and our standards of corporate governance have long been admired around the world.</p> <p>\u201cWe have maintained such a reputation by keeping our corporate governance framework under review. Today\u2019s reforms will build on our strong reputation and ensure our largest companies are more transparent and accountable to their employees and shareholders.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Martin, the head of the IoD, said his organisation welcomed \u201cthe pragmatic approach the government is taking to improve how company boards work\u201d.</p> <p>He said Clark was \u201ctaking a sensible approach on giving workers a bigger say, by allowing companies to choose the best way to implement the new rules\u201d.</p> <p>Paul Drechsler, the CBI president, said: \u201cWe know that how companies act and behave determines the way people think about business. Companies take this seriously and we look forward to working closely with the government to ensure the UK maintains its reputation as a global leader in this field and as a primary location for international investment.</p> <p>\u201cThe CBI is very clear that the unacceptable behaviour of a few does not reflect the high standards and responsible behaviour of the vast majority of companies.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker, GlaxoSmithKline, under pressure to improve its development pipeline and financial performance, is pinning its hopes on a radical new approach: \u201celectroceuticals\u201d. Also called bioelectronics, the idea is that tiny electronic implants will be able to treat a vast range of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), arthritis, hypertension and other heart conditions, and gastrointestinal diseases. A year after GSK teamed up with Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, to set up Galvani Bioelectronics, Kris Famm, who runs the venture, is confident that an implantable device capable of altering electrical impulses in the body is within reach. Several teams of academics are competing for a $1m (\u00a3770,000) prize promised by Galvani by racing to develop an implant that can record, stimulate and block neural signals, and are testing prototypes in animals. \u201cMaybe over the next 12 months we\u2019ll have one [a device],\u201d Famm tells the Guardian in an interview at Galvani\u2019s base in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. It will then be tested in initial human trials involving five to 10 people. The device must be easy to implant in the body via keyhole surgery, as well as being leak- and corrosion-proof and with enough battery power to avoid frequent charging. Galvani has struck more than 50 partnerships to speed up the development of bioelectronics, but is also working on its own device. \u201cThis is a decade-long endeavour,\u201d Famm says. \u201cFrom the mid-2020s we should see a wave of therapies that will make this [bioelectronics] much more commonplace.\u201d Famm believes in a \u201cbrave new future\u201d that will mean bioelectronics becomes a mainstay of medical treatment over the next two decades, benefiting up to 2 billion people \u2013 a quarter of the global population \u2013 who are suffering from chronic diseases. He likens it to the way mobile phones have changed our lives in the past 20 years. GSK is in need of fresh ideas, having struggled to develop new blockbuster medicines akin to the asthma and COPD drug Advair, once its biggest money-spinner. Its new chief executive, Emma Walmsley, has tightened the company\u2019s research and development focus and scrapped nearly one in seven clinical drug development programmes to focus on the \u201creal winners\u201d. The company remains committed to pumping \u00a3540m into the Galvani venture over seven years alongside its partner Verily, a division of Alphabet. Forty-five people are working for the venture in Stevenage and San Francisco, from data scientists and neuroscientists to neurosurgeons and software engineers. GSK is the only big pharma company working on the development of bioelectronics, and is competing with a number of smaller firms. Critics argue that bioelectronics is too risky, will take too long and is \u201ca bit bonkers\u201d. Aside from developing the implantable devices, the other major challenges include mapping the nervous system and understanding which nerves control bodily functions. Famm says some progress has been made but much more work needs to be done. Bioelectronic devices in the form of a cuff, bristling with electrodes, will be attached to nerve bundles to alter the electrical signals sent between the brain and the other organs in the body. Initially they are likely to be the size of a pill or a pen, but the aim is to make them as small as a grain of rice. Essentially, it\u2019s a matter of rewiring the body if signals go awry, Famm explains, describing the nervous system as a \u201cswitchboard with phone cables going out to different houses\u201d. \u201cThink of it as a little volume control on a nerve that controls an organ like the liver, pancreas, kidneys or spleen,\u201d he says. \u201cBy changing the volume, the signals that go into the nerve, up or down, you can control what the organ does: whether it produces less or more of a particular hormone or affects the constriction of the airways.\u201d This will be far more precise than the way conventional drugs work. \u201cThere\u2019s a real potential for optimisation and personalisation of therapy \u2013 controlling just one thing without side effects,\u201d Famm says. But bioelectronics is unlikely to work for cancer, where \u201ctypically things have gone extremely awry\u201d. Sufferers of brain disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s and pain conditions will also be disappointed because they affect the whole brain tissue. GSK decided to focus on the peripheral nervous system because the brain is hugely complex, Famm says. Prof John Donoghue, director of the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering in Geneva, said: \u201cCan you influence nerves? Yes, it can be done.\u201d But surrounding nerves with stimulating electrodes to get the right effect is tricky. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it bonkers but it\u2019s a hard thing to do,\u201d Donoghue adds. \u201cMaking this advance could easily take a decade or more. \u201cMost people who get into devices don\u2019t realise how difficult it is to get to a human trial. There are so many issues you have to worry about. For our first trial we sent 14 boxes of paper off to the FDA [US drug and device regulator] ... And if it works in animals it doesn\u2019t mean it works also in humans.\u201d The Wyss Center is working with Brown University and the BrainGate Group in the US on a project to restore movement to paralysed limbs, building on Donoghue\u2019s work since 2002. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic. It\u2019s just a matter of time before we have useful devices,\u201d he says. This story was amended on 3 September to clarify that Kris Famm was referring to the $1m competition when talking about the development of a device.",

    "webTitle": "Amazon's tech-style takeover of Whole Foods: cheaper produce and 'farm fresh' Echos", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Amid stands of discounted raspberries and \u201cend of summer\u201d organic peaches, Amazon\u2019s effort to revolutionize the US retail grocery business got under way Monday morning with deep price cuts to some produce at its newly acquired Whole Foods chain. Signs of Amazon\u2019s plans for Whole Foods, purchased for $13.7bn in June with the stated ambition of marrying technology and rapid distribution to the bricks-and-mortar business of food retail \u2013 including placing a stand of Amazon Echo devices, discounted from $149.99 to $99.99, next to the organic red seedless grapes. The grapes, in turn, were discounted from $3.99 a pound to $2.49, and large organic California yellow peaches had fallen from $3.49 a pound to $1.49. The placement of Amazon\u2019s artificial intelligence assistant plainly indicated the company\u2019s plan to integrate grocery shopping and delivery into its online and the Amazon smart AI assistant, called Alexa. In addition to the Echo, the Echo Dot was discounted from $49.99 to $44.99. One shopper, who gave her name as Celine, said she was unlikely to purchase peaches and the music-playing Echo at the same time, \u201cunless I\u2019m going to a barbecue\u201d. She said that while she welcomed cheaper prices at the chain often derisively known as \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d, she was also concerned that Amazon\u2019s entry into the food business could also serve to put smaller retailers out of business, increasing the sense that the Seattle-based tech online shopping behemoth now enjoys monopoly-like power. Last week, Amazon announced plans to begin integrating the two companies. \u201cThis is just the beginning \u2013 Amazon and Whole Foods Market plan to offer more in-store benefits and lower prices for customers over time as the two companies integrate logistics and point-of-sale and merchandising systems,\u201d Amazon/Whole Foods said. Over time, Amazon plans to integrate its Prime membership program into the Whole Foods checkout process. Amazon will also place its Amazon Lockers package pickup machines in some Whole Foods stores, and make Whole Foods\u2019 private label products available on its website. Jeff Wilke, the CEO of Amazon Worldwide Center, said on Thursday that the company is determined to make healthy and organic food affordable for everyone. \u201cEverybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market\u2019s long-held commitment to the highest standards.\u201d Shoppers in Manhattan \u2013 used to paying over the odds for almost everything \u2013 welcomed reductions on Whole Trade bananas, Gala and Fuji apples, tomatoes, salads, organic avocados (at two for $3, down from two for $5) and cartons of raspberries (two for $5, down from $4.99 each). At Agata &amp; Valentina, an upscale grocery close to Whole Foods on Manhattan\u2019s Union Square, price cuts had yet to be matched. Bananas were priced at $1.19 a pound, compared to 49\u00a2 (down from 79\u00a2) at Whole Foods. Similar avocados were $3 each, raspberries at $4.99 a box, and Gala apples at $2.29 a pound. Only tomatoes, reduced from $3.99 to $1.49, matched Whole Foods\u2019 aggressive new pricing. Another shopper, who offered her name as Wendy, welcomed the early changes. She said she had purchased 6lb of apples instead of four. \u201cI think they want to make it more Walmart,\u201d she ventured, referring to the nation\u2019s largest food retailer, typically found in suburban locations. Jenna Pairolero said she believed the change in ownership and operations would make \u201ca big difference, probably\u201d. But, she added: \u201cI don\u2019t really pay attention to prices at all, frankly.\u201d Analysts anticipate that Amazon will be able to use its massive buying power and vast supply chain with the infrastructure of Whole Foods\u2019 460 stores in the US, Canada and the UK to reduce prices purely through logistics. The list of products Amazon said it would immediately discount also include organic large brown eggs, baby kale, baby lettuce, \u201canimal-welfare-rated\u201d 85% lean ground beef, organic \u201cresponsibly farmed\u201d salmon and tilapia, creamy and crunchy almond butter, organic rotisserie chicken and house-brand organic butter. Shoppers who had not ventured into the vegetable section said they experienced no difference at the checkout. One customer, Neil, said it was \u201call about the same\u201d after purchasing pineapple chunks, a bottle of water and a muffin. Whole Foods employees in Manhattan said teams had worked overnight to prepare for the price drops, known as \u201cday one\u201d at the company. Nadia Papasidero said she rarely shopped at Whole Foods. \u201cI\u2019m happy to pay a little more for better quality,\u201d she said, but Whole Foods is \u201cbig-time too expensive\u201d. She said that if Whole Foods reduced its prices she would consider making it her \u201cmain shop\u201d for groceries. However, Papasidero said she was unlikely to use an AI assistant like Alexa: \u201cI\u2019m Italian, I love food shopping. I need to pick it up and look at it.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what to expect. Clearly, Amazon is a monopoly that\u2019s getting bigger. But from a customer perspective, I love for food to be affordable and still be fair for producers, I will be more eager to buy it.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Savills, the estate agent to London\u2019s elite, is facing accusations that it breached client confidentiality during a bitter battle between the billionaire Candy brothers and a former business associate. The company has received a demand to hand over evidence including text messages and emails relating to an acrimonious legal dispute between the property tycoons and Mark Holyoake. Holyoake has applied to the high court for disclosure of the documents with a view to launching a separate lawsuit against Savills, seeking compensation for alleged misconduct including breach of confidentiality, the Guardian understands. Any such lawsuit could prove embarrassing for Savills, which has a reputation for upholding high standards of discretion about the assets and financial affairs of its wealthy clientele. Holyoake is expected to claim that Savills knowingly passed on to Christian and Nicholas Candy a copy of a valuation he paid it to perform on his luxury home in Ibiza. This, he will allege, gave the brothers information about his assets that helped them exert financial pressure on him. Holyoake has accused the pair of extorting him into making \u00a337m of payments, via various penalties and renegotiated loan agreements, on a \u00a312m loan arranged by his former university friend Nicholas Candy. He is suing them for \u00a3132m in a separate, unresolved lawsuit concerning the loan. During that case, evidence emerged that Holyoake will indicate that Savills acted improperly. Emails submitted as evidence show Nicholas Candy became aware of the valuation following a lunch with Savills\u2019 director of valuation, Michael Sharpe-Neal, after which he emailed details of it to his brother. \u201cEven more worrying I have just had lunch with Michael Sharpe-Neal,\u201d he wrote, in an email sent in February 2012. \u201cThere is not enough security on the house to cover the \u00a312 million loan!!!\u201d Nicholas Candy testified during the case that he had obtained the valuation, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t remember whether I was offered it by Savills or whether I asked for it. But either way, I acknowledge it was wrong.\u201d Christian Candy testified that he had seen the valuation during a case that concluded earlier this year, with a verdict not expected until October. He was asked if the Savills valuation was \u201cplainly a confidential document which you should never have been provided\u201d and answered: \u201cYes.\u201d Holyoake wants Savills to turn over any further correspondence that could lend weight to his claim that the estate agent improperly disclosed its \u20ac16m (\u00a315m) valuation of his Ibiza property, called Casa Campanilla. Holyoake will highlight a close working relationship between the Candys and Savills, including the fact that the estate agency earned a \u00a310m commission on the brothers\u2019 One Hyde Park development. He will also claim that Savills passed further details about the Ibiza home, including a floor plan and photographs, which he will say were not publicly available and posed a security risk to him and his family. During his long-running dispute with the Candys, Holyoake alleged that Christian Candy physically threatened his pregnant wife, which the property tycoon strenuously denied. The businessman will allege that Savills acted against his interests by passing on information about a valuation of Grosvenor Gardens House, a luxury development he says the Candy brothers hoped to \u201csteal\u201d from him in lieu of loan repayment. He will say this, coupled with a delay by Savills in completing the valuation, frustrated his attempts to seek refinancing of his \u00a312m loan from the Candys and helped them extract higher repayments from him. Holyoake will allege that Savills further breached his confidentiality by telling Nicholas Candy that a cheque he paid to the estate agent had bounced. An email submitted as evidence in the previous case against the Candys shows Nicholas Candy saying \u201cNed\u201d, understood to be Ned Baring, a Savills director, had told him about the bounced cheque. The request for document disclosure from Savills is a procedural step that usually comes before a further legal claim. Holyoake is understood to believe that any documents turned over by Savills will form the basis of a claim for financial redress, including compensation for the alleged breaches of confidentiality. Savills is thought to have refused a request to disclose the documents voluntarily, but declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. Sharpe-Neal also declined to comment.",

    "webTitle": "'Shark in minnow pond': Ramsgate locals split on new Wetherspoon pub", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "JD Wetherspoon is opening its biggest UK pub in Ramsgate in a move that has divided opinion in the Kent seaside town. The chain, which continues to expand despite pubs closing at a rate of 30 a week, has spent \u00a34.5m refurbishing the Royal Victoria Pavilion ahead of the launch on Tuesday. The Grade II listed building, which opened in 1904, has been empty and become increasingly derelict since the Rank Leisure casino left in 2008. Wetherspoon will occupy two-thirds of the pavilion\u2019s 20,000 sq ft (1,858 sq m) interior, making it bigger than the company\u2019s Velvet Coaster pub in Blackpool, which is believed to be Britain\u2019s biggest boozer. The building can seat up to 800 people with a total capacity of more than 1,400. Outside, there is an additional 6,500 sq ft sun terrace. The chain worked with local historians to recreate aspects of the interior from the pavilion\u2019s heyday, including the bar and staircase. The walls feature art capturing the history of the pavilion and the town, as well as modern works by local artists. Ahead of the opening, Chris Whitbourn, the pub\u2019s joint manager, looked around the vast space with its mint walls and oak panelling. \u201cYou could probably land an aeroplane here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Whitbourn, a former area manager from Lincolnshire, said there was a lot of competition for the company\u2019s flagship site. To spread the word, Wetherspoon handed out tickets to more than 4,000 people to have a free meal and drinks over the bank holiday weekend before the full opening. The Pavilion will employ 150 staff, almost all of whom live locally. They will serve Wetherspoon\u2019s familiar formula of cheap drinks and food, including fish and chips, pizza and curry. Chris Wells, the Thanet district council leader, said only a company with Wetherspoon\u2019s deep pockets could have restored the building, emphasising that the council did not have the money to do so. \u201cIt demonstrates faith in Ramsgate, it creates jobs and it will bring visitors to the town,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d But some local businesses are less keen. Miles Wiseman, who owns the Arch Bar by the harbour, said the town does not have enough custom to support the Pavilion. Most of the seafront is worried Wetherspoon\u2019s low prices will take away business, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s too big. It\u2019s a shark in a minnow pond.\u201d Jon Zumeris, who lives in Ramsgate, is tucking into chicken tikka masala with colleagues from Fujifilm, which Wetherspoons invited to its preview as one of the area\u2019s biggest employers. Zumeris said he will switch from local bars to the Pavilion. \u201cI\u2019m a family man and I will come here with my children. It\u2019s a cheap place to eat and sit out,\u201d he said.\u201d The Pavilion\u2019s history mirrors Ramsgate\u2019s rise and fall. The building opened as a concert hall and assembly rooms, and thrived in the first half of the 20th century as people came to enjoy the town\u2019s seaside and royal harbour. But the arrival of overseas package tours in the 1960s sent Ramsgate into decline, along with many other seaside towns. Hotels became flats for families, often with social problems, from outside the town. In 2013, the Centre for Social Justice thinktank described coastal towns as dumping grounds trapped in a cycle of economic decline. Ramsgate has some of the most deprived council wards in England. The pavilion declined, too. It became Peggy Sue\u2019s nightclub, then Fifth Avenue, then a casino. Many of its original features were ripped out. The building was poorly maintained before the casino moved to Westwood Cross, a shopping development that locals blame for the town\u2019s ailing high street. But there are signs of renewal. Like its better-known neighbour Margate, Ramsgate has attracted artists, musicians and other creatives. Brenda Blethyn, the Golden Globe-winning actor, grew up in the town and lives there. The DJ and producer Adamski moved in a few years ago, and Blur\u2019s Graham Coxon has just bought a house there. New cafes, shops and galleries are springing up and property prices are on the rise. The HS1 rail link to London has cut commuting time from about two hours to little over an hour, bringing in more \u201cdown from Londons\u201d (DFLs) seeking an affordable life by the sea. Emma Irvine, an architect who moved to Ramsgate in 2009 and redeveloped the Albion House hotel, which she owns with her husband, wanted to turn the Pavilion into a venue based on London\u2019s Borough Market. She said the council favoured finding a strong leaseholder over long-term regeneration. \u201cWe had serious investors who had invested in the town before, but we were never going to beat Wetherspoon in a commercial property deal. The building has been refurbished, and providing something affordable and more family-friendly on the seafront is a good thing. It\u2019s hard to know if there are going to be negative aspects until it\u2019s open,\u201d Irvine said. Views in Ramsgate reflect wider divisions about Wetherspoon, with its near 1,000 branches regarded either as characterless boozehalls or beacons of value and reliability. In a town where Nigel Farage based his failed attempt to win South Thanet in 2015, some in Ramsgate also identify the chain with the support for Brexit of Wetherspoon\u2019s founder, Tim Martin. Claire Dugue, a hurdy-gurdy maker who moved to Ramsgate in 2001, said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure a big, cheap boozer on the beach is what the town needs and I\u2019m not keen on the owner\u2019s views on Brexit. But if they are a good employer, then fair enough.\u201d Most Ramsgate bar managers said they welcomed Wetherspoon or would try to cope with the competition. But Wiseman claimed his fellow traders were putting on a brave face or deluding themselves on a busy bank holiday weekend. Wetherspoon, he insisted, is bad news. \u201cCome and see me in January when it\u2019s freezing cold and there\u2019s no one around,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople come here from London because it\u2019s a quirky town with independent traders. The quirkiness will be diluted and the DFLs will say it\u2019s not quite the place they thought it was, and they will stop coming.\u201d But Whitbourn said Wetherspoon needed the town as a whole to thrive for its big investment in Ramsgate to succeed. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in us taking all the trade and everybody else closing. There have to be plenty of options for everyone. We want the whole town to be better,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>JD Wetherspoon is opening its biggest UK pub in Ramsgate in a move that has divided opinion in the Kent seaside town.<br></p> <p>The chain, which continues to expand despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/07/community-groups-call-time-on-the-demise-of-the-british-pub\">pubs closing at a rate of 30 a week</a>, has spent \u00a34.5m refurbishing the Royal Victoria Pavilion ahead of the launch on Tuesday. The Grade II listed building, which opened in 1904, has been empty and become increasingly derelict since the Rank Leisure casino left in 2008.</p> <p>Wetherspoon will occupy two-thirds of the pavilion\u2019s 20,000 sq ft (1,858 sq m) interior, making it bigger than the company\u2019s Velvet Coaster pub in Blackpool, which is believed to be Britain\u2019s biggest boozer. </p> <p>The building can seat up to 800 people with a total capacity of more than 1,400. Outside, there is an additional 6,500 sq ft sun terrace. The chain worked with local historians to recreate aspects of the interior from the pavilion\u2019s heyday, including the bar and staircase. </p> <p>The walls feature art capturing the history of the pavilion and the town, as well as modern works by local artists. Ahead of the opening, Chris Whitbourn, the pub\u2019s joint manager, looked around the vast space with its mint walls and oak panelling. \u201cYou could probably land an aeroplane here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d </p> <p>Whitbourn, a former area manager from Lincolnshire, said there was a lot of competition for the company\u2019s flagship site. To spread the word, Wetherspoon handed out tickets to more than 4,000 people to have a free meal and drinks over the bank holiday weekend before the full opening. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"feb1e7d8cb53a062d79124e2ca361c1013e9046e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feb1e7d8cb53a062d79124e2ca361c1013e9046e/0_108_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The interior of the Royal Victoria Pavilion pub\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The interior of the Royal Victoria Pavilion pub, which occupies two-thirds of the 20,000 sq ft building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Pavilion will employ 150 staff, almost all of whom live locally. They will serve Wetherspoon\u2019s familiar formula of cheap drinks and food, including fish and chips, pizza and curry.</p> <p>Chris Wells, the Thanet district council leader, said only a company with Wetherspoon\u2019s deep pockets could have restored the building, emphasising that the council did not have the money to do so. \u201cIt demonstrates faith in Ramsgate, it creates jobs and it will bring visitors to the town,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d</p> <p>But some local businesses are less keen. Miles Wiseman, who owns the Arch Bar by the harbour, said the town does not have enough custom to support the Pavilion. Most of the seafront is worried Wetherspoon\u2019s low prices will take away business, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s too big. It\u2019s a shark in a minnow pond.\u201d</p> <p>Jon Zumeris, who lives in Ramsgate, is tucking into chicken tikka masala with colleagues from Fujifilm, which Wetherspoons invited to its preview as one of the area\u2019s biggest employers. Zumeris said he will switch from local bars to the Pavilion. \u201cI\u2019m a family man and I will come here with my children. It\u2019s a cheap place to eat and sit out,\u201d he said.\u201d</p> <p>The Pavilion\u2019s history mirrors Ramsgate\u2019s rise and fall. The building opened as a concert hall and assembly rooms, and thrived in the first half of the 20th century as people came to enjoy the town\u2019s seaside and royal harbour. But the arrival of overseas package tours in the 1960s sent Ramsgate into decline, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/may/14/once-more-on-to-the-beach-how-britains-seaside-towns-bounced-back\">along with many other seaside towns</a>. Hotels became flats for families, often with social problems, from outside the town. </p> <p>In 2013, the Centre for Social Justice thinktank described coastal towns as dumping grounds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/oct/17/coastal-towns-problems-britain-deprivation-population\">trapped in a cycle of economic decline</a>. Ramsgate has some of the most deprived council wards in England. The pavilion declined, too. It became Peggy Sue\u2019s nightclub, then Fifth Avenue, then a casino. Many of its original features were ripped out. The building was poorly maintained before the casino moved to Westwood Cross, a shopping development that locals blame for the town\u2019s ailing high street. But there are signs of renewal. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a813308158bbbd65da3136beb222633ec5cf91d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a813308158bbbd65da3136beb222633ec5cf91d5/0_130_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People get stuck into curry night at the Royal Victoria Pavilion\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People get stuck into curries at the Royal Victoria Pavilion.

Brenda Blethyn, the Golden Globe-winning actor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/31/brenda-blethyn-ethel-and-ernest-raymond-briggs-film-animation\">grew up in the town and lives there</a>. The DJ and producer Adamski moved in a few years ago, and Blur\u2019s Graham Coxon has just bought a house there. New cafes, shops and galleries are springing up and property prices are on the rise. The HS1 rail link to London has cut commuting time from about two hours to little over an hour, bringing in more \u201cdown from Londons\u201d (DFLs) seeking an affordable life by the sea.</p> <p>Emma Irvine, an architect who moved to Ramsgate in 2009 and redeveloped the Albion House hotel, which she owns with her husband, wanted to turn the Pavilion into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/27/ramsgate-pavilion-redevelopment-superpub\">venue based on London\u2019s Borough Market</a>. She said the council favoured finding a strong leaseholder over long-term regeneration.</p> <p>\u201cWe had serious investors who had invested in the town before, but we were never going to beat Wetherspoon in a commercial property deal. The building has been refurbished, and providing something affordable and more family-friendly on the seafront is a good thing. It\u2019s hard to know if there are going to be negative aspects until it\u2019s open,\u201d Irvine said.</p> <p>Views in Ramsgate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/06/how-britain-fell-for-wetherspoons\">reflect wider divisions about Wetherspoon</a>, with its near 1,000 branches regarded either as characterless boozehalls or beacons of value and reliability. In a town where Nigel Farage based his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/20/nigel-farage-stand-election-again-south-thanet\">failed attempt to win South Thanet</a> in 2015, some in Ramsgate also identify the chain with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/wetherspoons-founder-tim-marting-blasts-establishment-over-brexit-vote\">support for Brexit of Wetherspoon\u2019s founder</a>, Tim Martin. Claire Dugue, a hurdy-gurdy maker who moved to Ramsgate in 2001, said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure a big, cheap boozer on the beach is what the town needs and I\u2019m not keen on the owner\u2019s views on Brexit. But if they are a good employer, then fair enough.\u201d</p> <p>Most Ramsgate bar managers said they welcomed Wetherspoon or would try to cope with the competition. But Wiseman claimed his fellow traders were putting on a brave face or deluding themselves on a busy bank holiday weekend. Wetherspoon, he insisted, is bad news.</p> <p>\u201cCome and see me in January when it\u2019s freezing cold and there\u2019s no one around,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople come here from London because it\u2019s a quirky town with independent traders.

In a joint statement, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the Association of German Chambers of Commerce (DIHK) said German and British companies want clarity from the outset on the overall shape of the final settlement. A number of major issues relevant to businesses are yet to be resolved, including the rights of EU workers in Britain and British workers in the other 27 EU member states. There is a growing view that talks on Britain\u2019s future trade relationship with the bloc could be delayed beyond the autumn. The EU will decide in October whether Britain has made sufficient progress on Brexit divorce issues, including the thorny subject of an exit bill, before talks move on to trade. There are hundreds of practical and technical issues, including customs arrangements and tax procedures, that need to be resolved during later stages of the negotiations. Businesses in both the UK and Germany want to see talks move on to these issues, customs in particular, as soon as possible. Adam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s director general, said: \u201cAs Brexit talks continue, it\u2019s clear that companies in the UK and on the continent all want economic issues to rise to the top of the negotiations agenda. There is real business appetite from both sides for a focus on practical, day-to-day business concerns, and a desire for clarity on future trading arrangements.\u201d Martin Wansleben, the DIHK\u2019s head, said: \u201cThe terms of exit are still completely unclear. Many of our members are reporting that they are already shifting investments away from the UK in anticipation of these barriers.\u201d Wansleben noted that German exports to the UK were down 3% in the first half of this year on a year earlier; while exports to the rest of the EU rose 6%. A recent BCC survey showed that British firms prefer a longer transition period, with 68% advocating at least three years. A DIHK survey has found that the business outlook of companies that trade with Britain is worsening. They are expecting higher costs from limits on the free movement of workers, taxes, tariffs and increasing bureaucratic hurdles at Europe\u2019s new borders.

      "bodyText": "Airline passengers could fly to their destinations on jets fuelled by industrial waste or the contents of people\u2019s dustbins if a government scheme succeeds in creating a new green energy source. The Department for Transport (DfT) is offering \u00a322m of funding for projects to develop low-carbon, waste-based fuels for planes and lorries. About 70 groups want to bid for funding. The move follows the introduction of grants to encourage the take-up of ultra-low-emission electric vehicles, and plans to ban all new petrol and diesel cars by 2040, amid fears that rising levels of nitrogen oxide pose a major risk to public health. The government has identified poor air quality as the biggest environmental risk to public health in Britain. DfT data show that aircraft and lorries powered by waste fuels could use up to 90% less carbon than if they were powered by traditional fossil fuels. Planes and lorries are too heavy to use electric power. Trials of jet fuel made from waste materials have already been conducted in Europe and North America. Last year, a US company working with Virgin Atlantic created a jet fuel from waste industrial gases from steel mills, which was estimated to be 65% cleaner than conventional jet fuel. BP in November announced a $30m (\u00a323m) investment in US firm Fulcrum BioEnergy, which makes biofuel from household rubbish. Rubbish can also be used to heat homes. A new \u00a325m plant developed by Advanced Plasma Power in Swindon will take household and commercial waste to produce \u201cgreen\u201d gas. The transport minister, Jesse Norman, said: \u201cWe are committed to cutting carbon emissions and promoting new environmentally friendly fuels that will help us meet that goal. We are making funding available to innovative businesses, which will lead the way in developing alternative fuels that are efficient, sustainable and clean. \u201cWe want every new car and van in the UK to be zero-emission by 2040, but we know lorries and aeroplanes will rely on more traditional fuels for years to come, so we must promote environmentally friendly alternatives.\u201d There are hopes that the government funding will help create five new low-carbon fuel plants by 2021. The DfT believes low-carbon transport fuels made from waste could be worth \u00a3600m to the British economy by 2030 and support up to 9,800 new jobs. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 August 2017 to remove a mistaken reference to the FTSE 100.",

BP in November announced a $30m (\u00a323m) investment in US firm Fulcrum BioEnergy, which makes biofuel from household rubbish. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/20/the-eco-guide-to-electric-vehicle-hype\">The eco guide to Electric Vehicle hype</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rubbish can also be used to heat homes. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/11/27/black-bags-green-gas-rubbish-could-power-homes/\">A new \u00a325m plant developed by Advanced Plasma Power in Swindon will take household and commercial waste to produce \u201cgreen\u201d gas</a>.</p> <p>The transport minister, Jesse Norman, said: \u201cWe are committed to cutting carbon emissions and promoting new environmentally friendly fuels that will help us meet that goal. We are making funding available to innovative businesses, which will lead the way in developing alternative fuels that are efficient, sustainable and clean. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe want every new car and van in the UK to be zero-emission by 2040, but we know lorries and aeroplanes will rely on more traditional fuels for years to come, so we must promote environmentally friendly alternatives.\u201d</p> <p>There are hopes that the government funding will help create five new low-carbon fuel plants by 2021. The DfT believes low-carbon transport fuels made from waste could be worth \u00a3600m to the British economy by 2030 and support up to 9,800 new jobs.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 August 2017 to remove a mistaken reference to the FTSE 100.<br></p> <p> </p>",
