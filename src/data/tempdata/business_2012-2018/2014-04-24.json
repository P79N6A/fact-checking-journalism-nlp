    "webTitle": "Barclays AGM: shareholders large and small protest over pay and bonuses", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays faced a barrage of criticism over its pay policies at an acrimonious annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday, with the board being accused of greed after handing out \u00a32.4bn in bonuses last year. The bank's chairman, Sir David Walker, tried repeatedly to defend the bonus payouts, which resulted in 481 Barclays' bankers being paid more than \u00a31m last year. \"Why do you think you're worth it?\" asked one small shareholder. \"It's jam tomorrow for the investors but champagne today for the investment bankers,\" said another. One was applauded after complaining of management greed. One in three shareholders failed to support the bank's remuneration report, which showed that bonuses rose 10% despite a 32% fall in profits. Walker had promised a year ago to restrain top pay. One private investor, who expressed his irritation at the bank's dividend payments, poor performance and \u00a35.8bn cash call to bolster its finances last year, told the packed Royal Festival Hall: \"We're paying for Manchester United but we are getting Colchester United.\" Annual investor meetings are usually dominated by private shareholders who hold small amounts of votes. But one major City investor, Standard Life Investments, which owns almost 2% of Barclays, spoke out to say it had voted against the pay deals. Alison Kennedy, a director at Standard Life Investments, told the board: \"We are unconvinced that the amount of the 2013 bonus pool was in the best interests of shareholders, particularly when we consider how the bank's profits are divided amongs employees, shareholders and ongoing investment in the business.\" Sir John Sunderland, the independent director who oversees Barclays' pay policies, said it had been forced to increase bonuses because the number of investment bankers quitting to earn more elsewhere had doubled and it had feared an exodus of these key staff. He appeared to reprimand Kennedy for speaking out in a public meeting rather than raising her concerns during the private consultations that take place with major investors. After the AGM, Walker also admitted to \"a bit of irritation\" that Standard Life had raised its concerns late in the day. Sunderland, who has been on the Barclays board for 10 years, maintained that bonuses were down 18% if the penalties imposed for Libor-rigging in the previous year were taken into account. When he asked the meeting: \"Do you imagine we want to pay anyone more in this bank more than we need to?\" he was met with resounding cries of \"yes!\". F&amp;C, another major City investor, later admitted it also did not back the remuneration report. But like the majority, it backed two other votes on pay: a new vote on the bank's pay policy over the next three years and a vote to allow bonuses of twice salary to be paid. The latter vote was required because of the new EU bonus cap that would otherwise have restricted bonuses to one times salary. However, the bank will continue to make higher payouts than allowed under the new cap because it has introduced new \"allowances\" on top of pay and bonus payouts. Boardroom pay was put in back in focus this week by Vince Cable when the business secretary wrote to the pay bosses of big companies to urge restraint. Barclays was not the only business to face shareholder fury on Thursday. At the pharmaceutical company Astra Zeneca's AGM almost 40% of shareholders voted against the company's pay report. And at the recruitment company SThree, where the Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi sits on the remuneration committee, just 50.5% voted in favour of its pay policies. The Barclays chairman repeatedly defended the bank's bonus payouts and said it lost the two co-heads of its US bond-trading desk last year and faced losing two thirds of their team. The bonus payments, he said, were \"in the interest of franchise protection and damage limitation\". The 73-year-old chairman \u2013 who was parachuted in after the 2012 Libor fine and whose successor is being sought \u2013 said the bank had made a mistake in cutting back bonuses too quickly after the interest rate-rigging scandal which forced out his predecessor, Marcus Agius, and the chief executive Bob Diamond. The scale of the rebellion over pay \u2013 which was 34% if votes against and deliberate abstentions are included \u2013 was similar to that registered when Diamond was still chief executive. Private investors stood up to question the bonus payouts at the meeting. \"Is Barclays a prisoner to pay to its senior staff?\" asked one to applause. One investor who spoke up in defence of bonuses \u2013 the former City fund manager and Conservative party donor Patrick Evershed \u2013 was jeered by one of those present, who shouted \"call him a taxi\". Walker opened the meeting with a promise not to have a repeat of this year's bonus row. \"Your board and I do not intend or expect to face again a similar set of circumstances that led to the very difficult decisions we had to take last year,\" he said. \"The decision on pay this year was among the hardest that we have had to take.\"",

      "body": "<p>First quarter profits at General Motors have plunged by 88% as the US-based carmaker was hit by a $1.3bn (\u00a3774m) charge to cover the cost of a major product recall.</p> <p>The company, which manufactures brands such as Cadillac and Chevrolet, plus Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port and Luton, also took a $300m hit for restructuring parts of its European business.</p> <p>\"Obviously, the recall campaign charges in the first quarter overshadows the headline results, but if you look underneath that, we had strong performance across the board,\" said Chuck Stevens, GM's chief financial officer.</p> <p>But he insisted it was too early to say whether the vehicle manufacturer would need to take further financial charges over defective ignition switches which have been linked to at least 13 deaths.</p> <p>GM reported net income during the first three months of 2014 of $125m, compared with $865m in the same period last year, while sales rose to $37.4bn, up from $36.9bn in 2013.</p> <p>Analysts said it was GM's worst quarterly performance since it unveiled a net loss after leaving bankruptcy protection in 2009, but many had been expecting worse and its shares fell only 1.5%.</p> <p>\"It should be good enough to ease concerns,\" Citi analyst Itay Michaeli told Reuters. \"Expectations were very low. People were just kind of nervous overall about how the quarter would look. The story really here though, in terms of fundamentals, is better performance in the international regions.\"</p> <p>GM was until 2011 the biggest car seller in the world but it has been knocked off the top spot by Japan's Toyota. The latter has just announced first quarter sales bigger than GM and Volkswagen, the German contender for the top spot, after soaring sales in China.</p> <p>In North America GM experienced higher than expected sales of its more lucrative versions of the redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickup trucks.</p> <p>\"The performance of our core operations was very strong this quarter, reflecting the positive response of customers to the new vehicles we are bringing to market,\" said Mary Barra, the company's chief executive .</p> <p>\"Our focus remains on creating the world's best vehicles with the highest levels of safety, quality and customer service, while aggressively addressing our business opportunities and challenges globally,\" she added.</p> <p>Some GM ignition switches have made vehicle engines stall and stopped airbags from working while halting the use of power steering and brakes.</p> <p>The company is under investigation by US safety regulators, Congress and the department of justice over its failure to detect the faulty part for more than a decade. There have been calls from some quarters for GM to set up a victim compensation fund.</p> <p>Of the $1.3bn to cover the various recalls in the first quarter, GM said about $700m was related to the defective ignition switches, including $300m to cover the cost of courtesy cars for owners who do not want to drive the cars affected by the recall switch.</p> <p>The loss in Europe widened to $284m from $152m last year, but the quarter included $200m in restructuring costs already outlined by the company.

      "bodyText": "First quarter profits at General Motors have plunged by 88% as the US-based carmaker was hit by a $1.3bn (\u00a3774m) charge to cover the cost of a major product recall. The company, which manufactures brands such as Cadillac and Chevrolet, plus Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port and Luton, also took a $300m hit for restructuring parts of its European business. \"Obviously, the recall campaign charges in the first quarter overshadows the headline results, but if you look underneath that, we had strong performance across the board,\" said Chuck Stevens, GM's chief financial officer. But he insisted it was too early to say whether the vehicle manufacturer would need to take further financial charges over defective ignition switches which have been linked to at least 13 deaths. GM reported net income during the first three months of 2014 of $125m, compared with $865m in the same period last year, while sales rose to $37.4bn, up from $36.9bn in 2013. Analysts said it was GM's worst quarterly performance since it unveiled a net loss after leaving bankruptcy protection in 2009, but many had been expecting worse and its shares fell only 1.5%. \"It should be good enough to ease concerns,\" Citi analyst Itay Michaeli told Reuters. \"Expectations were very low. People were just kind of nervous overall about how the quarter would look. The story really here though, in terms of fundamentals, is better performance in the international regions.\" GM was until 2011 the biggest car seller in the world but it has been knocked off the top spot by Japan's Toyota. The latter has just announced first quarter sales bigger than GM and Volkswagen, the German contender for the top spot, after soaring sales in China. In North America GM experienced higher than expected sales of its more lucrative versions of the redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickup trucks. \"The performance of our core operations was very strong this quarter, reflecting the positive response of customers to the new vehicles we are bringing to market,\" said Mary Barra, the company's chief executive . \"Our focus remains on creating the world's best vehicles with the highest levels of safety, quality and customer service, while aggressively addressing our business opportunities and challenges globally,\" she added. Some GM ignition switches have made vehicle engines stall and stopped airbags from working while halting the use of power steering and brakes. The company is under investigation by US safety regulators, Congress and the department of justice over its failure to detect the faulty part for more than a decade. There have been calls from some quarters for GM to set up a victim compensation fund. Of the $1.3bn to cover the various recalls in the first quarter, GM said about $700m was related to the defective ignition switches, including $300m to cover the cost of courtesy cars for owners who do not want to drive the cars affected by the recall switch. The loss in Europe widened to $284m from $152m last year, but the quarter included $200m in restructuring costs already outlined by the company. Stevens said GM was seeing real progress in Europe and still believed financial results there would return to break even by the middle of the decade. In the past there have been concerns that GM's factories at Ellesmere Port on Merseyside and Luton in Bedfordshire could close. The latter lost its car manufacturing more than a decade ago and now only makes vans. Two years ago the future of Ellesmere Port was assured until at least 2020 after it was chosen to build a new generation of Astra cars.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Gherkin, voted London's favourite tower, has been put into receivership 10 years after its completion helped transform the capital's skyline. The 41-storey City landmark is likely to be put up for sale shortly and is expected to attract offers of more than \u00a3550m from Middle East sovereign wealth funds and other potential buyers. Deloitte, appointed to take control of the tower, said the Gherkin's co-owners \u2013 a Mayfair-based investment bank and a German property investor, IVG Immobilien \u2013 had run into problems related to currency issues, rather than any difficulties with the wider property market. Changing exchange rates had inflated the size of the original loan and the owners failed to make debt payments as they became due on several occasions. Phil Bowers, one of the Deloitte receivers, said: \"This is a building in trophy condition whose space is 99% leased. The multi-currency deal that financed the Gherkin has been affected by the substantial appreciation of the Swiss franc against the pound.\" The first 15 floors of the Norman Foster-designed skyscraper are occupied by the insurer Swiss Re, which originally owned the building. It sold out to IVG and its investment bank partner, Evans Randall, in 2007 for \u00a3630m. Deloitte said the tenants, who also include Sky News and the highest private club in London, would not be affected by the receivership. The Gherkin, which is also used as a wedding venue, has not yet been put on the market, but a sale process is likely to start in the coming months. Swiss Re spent about \u00a3238m building the Gherkin on the site at St Mary Axe of the Baltic Exchange shipping market, which was badly damaged by an IRA bomb attack in 1992. James Roberts, head of commercial property research at Knight Frank, said Deloitte would have no problem finding new buyers for the Gherkin. \"The commercial property sector follows the general economic cycle and at the moment the central London economy is doing well and the City is improving. The EC3 postcode around the Gherkin is always slightly warmer than others because they are close to the Lloyd's of London insurance market which still uses face to face trading,\" he said. It could be sold to a large global pension fund, or a US private equity house, but it was more likely that well-funded sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East or Asia would swoop, he added. In December an investment firm owned by the Singapore government bought a half share of the massive Broadgate development in London for \u00a31.7bn. Kuwait spent a similar amount buying an office complex next to Tower Bridge. In 2013 commercial property investment in the UK hit \u00a353bn \u2013 mostly deals in London and the south-east \u2013 which was the highest since the financial crisis of 2008. But there were also warnings last night about the likelihood of the Gherkin's financing problems not being the last. Glyn Mummery, a partner at FRP Advisory, which helps with financial restructuring, said the multi-currency financial arrangements in place at the Gherkin were not uncommon in big London property deals and there could be further casualties. \"We expect similar crunch times ahead for overseas investors who have misjudged their currency arrangements.\" The Gherkin, which has won multiple awards, has run into trouble at a time when dozens of new skyscrapers are planned. Boris Johnson, the mayor, has been accused of being too eager to allow developers to change the skyline. The rash of buildings with nicknames such as the Cheesegrater and Walkie Talkiehave attracted criticism, some of it from Prince Charles.",

There has been a marked postwar shift in economic power from manufacturing to services.</strong> In 1948, British industry (including manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, and utilities) accounted for 41% of the British economy. By 2013, it was just 14%.</p> <p>At the same time the services sector's share of the economy has risen from 46% to 79%. Construction, meanwhile, has remained stable at about 6% of GDP, and the role of agriculture has dwindledfrom 6% to 1% over the postwar years.</p> <p><strong>2. The changing makeup of the UK economy is roughly in line with other major economies (but manufacturing has declined most rapidly in the UK)</strong>. All G7 economies (UK, US, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Japan) have seen roughly the same change in composition as the UK, with a gradual decline in production and manufacturing as a proportion of GDP. The UK and France are at the bottom of the pack, with just 10% of their economies attributable to manufacturing. Germany comes out on top at 22%, followed by Japan at 19%.</p> <p>\"The UK manufacturing industry has declined at the fastest pace of the G7 economies; resulting in the UK moving from having one of the largest shares in 1948 to the lowest in 2012,\" the ONS notes.</p> <p><strong>3. Britain's financial services sector grew rapidly between 2006 and 2009.</strong> The UK economy has long been a dominant player in financial services, along with the US, but growth in the sector between 2006 and 2009 was particularly rapid. By 2009, the sector accounted for 10% of UK GDP, the highest of all G7 economies. The second highest was Canada at 6.7%, and the lowest was Germany at 3.9%. The dominance of the sector in Britain meant it was hit harder by the financial crash. Its share of the economy fell by 2.9 percentage points, while it remained roughly stable in other major economies. Output in the UK financial services sector is still 13.6% below pre-crisis levels according to the latest ONS data.</p> <p><strong>4. Financial services are a key part of UK exports.</strong> Britain has the highest ratio of services exports to GDP in the G7, at 13%. It also has the biggest share of financial services exports by some way, at 29% in 2012. The second is the US at 15%, with Japan exporting the least at 3%.</p> <p><strong>5. Britain's export performance improved during the downturn and subsequent recovery.</strong> Net trade \u2013 exports minus imports \u2013 was a drag on UK growth between 1997 and 2007, but that trend was reversed during the downturn and subsequently as the economy recovers, partly as a sharp fall in the pound between 2007 and 2009 made UK goods cheaper abroad.</p> <p><strong>6. Britain spends less on investment than any other G7 economy.</strong> The UK spent 15% of GDP on investment in 2013, just behind Germany and Italy (in 2012) on 17% while at the opposite end of the scale France spent 25% and Canada 22%.</p> <p>\"The UK economy is yet to see the strong recovery in fixed investment that is necessary for sustained GDP growth \u2013 with the level of investment 16.2% lower in 2013 when compared with 2008,\" the ONS notes.</p> <p><strong>7. UK household spending suffered the biggest fall in the G7 in 2008-09.</strong> Household spending in Britain fell 5.7% between the first quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2009. The ONS challenges the assumption that the UK recovery has been particularly reliant on consumer spending.</p> <p>\"Despite it being widely reported that the UK economic recovery has been dominated by household consumption, the sector only recovered the output lost in the economic downturn in 2013, while all other G7 economies, with the exception of Italy, passed this milestone much earlier.\"</p> <p>Household spending has picked up over the last year, however, rising 2.2% between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2013.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Britain's economic recovery appears to be well under way but, with growth apparently secured and the outlook bright, the focus has shifted to the nature of the recovery. It is the received wisdom that in the runup to the financial crisis that hit in 2008, the UK economy was too heavily dependent on credit-fuelled consumer spending and on financial services. A shift towards more manufacturing and exports is required if a sustainable economic future is to be built. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said earlier this month that it expects the UK economy to grow at a faster pace than its G7 peers and its verdict came amid a raft of positive data in recent weeks. While with one breath George Osborne welcomed the IMF's flattering conclusion, with the next he stressed the job was not yet done and more work was needed \"to get our exports and investment going\". It is timely then, that the Office for National Statistics has published a detailed analysis looking at the nature of Britain's economy, how it has changed over time, and how it compares with other countries. It confirms a lot of what we already knew about the decline of Britain's industrial base over the past 60 years, but puts it in to a broader context: it is part of shrinking industry in the wider G7. It also highlights the scale of the rebalancing challenge ahead, with Britain spending the least on investment of all G7 economies, and much more reliant on financial services than its peers. Here are the key points. 1. There has been a marked postwar shift in economic power from manufacturing to services. In 1948, British industry (including manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, and utilities) accounted for 41% of the British economy. By 2013, it was just 14%.

Germany comes out on top at 22%, followed by Japan at 19%. \"The UK manufacturing industry has declined at the fastest pace of the G7 economies; resulting in the UK moving from having one of the largest shares in 1948 to the lowest in 2012,\" the ONS notes. 3. Britain's financial services sector grew rapidly between 2006 and 2009. The UK economy has long been a dominant player in financial services, along with the US, but growth in the sector between 2006 and 2009 was particularly rapid. By 2009, the sector accounted for 10% of UK GDP, the highest of all G7 economies. The second highest was Canada at 6.7%, and the lowest was Germany at 3.9%. The dominance of the sector in Britain meant it was hit harder by the financial crash. Its share of the economy fell by 2.9 percentage points, while it remained roughly stable in other major economies. Output in the UK financial services sector is still 13.6% below pre-crisis levels according to the latest ONS data. 4. Financial services are a key part of UK exports. Britain has the highest ratio of services exports to GDP in the G7, at 13%. It also has the biggest share of financial services exports by some way, at 29% in 2012. The second is the US at 15%, with Japan exporting the least at 3%. 5. Britain's export performance improved during the downturn and subsequent recovery. Net trade \u2013 exports minus imports \u2013 was a drag on UK growth between 1997 and 2007, but that trend was reversed during the downturn and subsequently as the economy recovers, partly as a sharp fall in the pound between 2007 and 2009 made UK goods cheaper abroad. 6. Britain spends less on investment than any other G7 economy. The UK spent 15% of GDP on investment in 2013, just behind Germany and Italy (in 2012) on 17% while at the opposite end of the scale France spent 25% and Canada 22%. \"The UK economy is yet to see the strong recovery in fixed investment that is necessary for sustained GDP growth \u2013 with the level of investment 16.2% lower in 2013 when compared with 2008,\" the ONS notes. 7. UK household spending suffered the biggest fall in the G7 in 2008-09. Household spending in Britain fell 5.7% between the first quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2009. The ONS challenges the assumption that the UK recovery has been particularly reliant on consumer spending. \"Despite it being widely reported that the UK economic recovery has been dominated by household consumption, the sector only recovered the output lost in the economic downturn in 2013, while all other G7 economies, with the exception of Italy, passed this milestone much earlier.\" Household spending has picked up over the last year, however, rising 2.2% between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2013.",

The continuing defaults are due to the asset\u2019s complex, multicurrency capital structure.

On behalf of our clients, we have today instructed our proxy to vote against Resolution 2, the approval of the Remuneration Report.</p> <p>We did not take this decision lightly but, on balance, believe this was the right thing to do. We appreciate that there were competitive pressures during 2013, particularly in the Investment Banking business and that the board was seeking to protect a business franchise under threat.<br></p> <p>Nevertheless, we are unconvinced that the amount of the 2013 bonus pool was in the best interests of shareholders, particularly when we consider how the bank's profits are divided amongst employees, shareholders and ongoing investment in the business. The dividend was unchanged in the year and an additional \u00a35.8bn of capital was raised from shareholders. We also believe that this decision has had negative repercussions on the bank's reputation.<br></p> <p>I should make it clear that we have supported the resolutions to approve the forward-looking Remuneration Policy and to approve a limit on variable remuneration of 2 times fixed remuneration.<br></p> <p>Looking to the future, the board has stated its intention of reducing the compensation to net income ratio over the medium term. We support this intention and it is important that, over time, the board demonstrates convincingly that this will be achieved. However, we should like to see more clarity about the criteria the board will consider when determining the ratio. This would help set expectations and improve accountability as well as helping to restore trust. Will the board consider providing such clarity over the coming year?</p> </blockquote> <p><b>From the room, our City editor Jill Treanor says that Sir John Sunderland showed his irritation at facing her at the AGM, asked her to have made the remarks during the private consultations with big City investors.</b></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-24T11:40:15.971Z\">at 12.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5358f1a8e4b0417d63e7d142\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-24T11:19:00.696Z\">12.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>A Barclays investor puts the boot into the board, saying they are paying Premiership wages but getting a lower division performance.

      "bodyText": "And that's all for today. Details of the Barclays pay revolt, and reaction to it, starts here. Jill Treanor's latest news story on Barclays' stormy AGM is here. Here's the earlier summary of all the action at the Royal Festival Hall. And our photo gallery is here. Bad news for AstraZeneca as shareholder rebellion on pay turns out to be worse than Barclays Thanks, and good night. GW After Barclays, comes AstraZeneca. The pharmaceuticals group, which released results earlier and has been reportedly the target of a \u00a360bn approach from Pfizer, has just released the results of its annual meeting today. And they don't make happy reading for the company. Some 38.5% of shareholders voted against the remuneration report, even before taking into account the abstentions. Director Jean-Philippe Courtois may be feeling nervous too - 43% of shareholders voted against his re-election. His day job is being president of Microsoft International. Full details of the vote here. The better than expected results from Apple and Facebook lifted technology shares, writes Nick Fletcher, while hopes of further deals in the healthcare sector also supported stock markets. But renewed worries about tensions between Russia and Ukraine saw shares come off their best levels, as investors were reminded geo-political risks had not just suddenly gone away. So by the close: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 28.26 points or 0.42% higher at 6703.00, a near seven week high \u2022 Germany's Dax edged up 0.05% to 9548.68 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.64% higher at 4479.54 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 0.66% better at 21,819.48 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended up 0.36% at 10,462 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 13 points or 0.08% better. Barclays, incidently, closed 3.1p better at 252p despite facing the wrath of investors at its annual meeting. Another institutional investor, F&amp;C, has revealed that it also joined the rebellion against Barclays over bankers' pay. Eugenia Jackson, head of corporate governance at F&amp;C Investments, acknowledged that the bank had made some progress on remuneration -- but not enough. Our vote has taken into consideration improvements in the company's remuneration practices, including a clear link between Transform programme targets and executive remuneration; assessment of executive and increasingly employee performance against Balanced Scorecard, as well as consideration of culture and adherence to corporate values in remuneration decisions. We also acknowledge flat executive salaries, the forfeiting of bonuses by the chief executive for the second year and the Committee\u2019s ability to keep the recruitment package for the new finance director largely within the stated policy. \u201cHowever our vote reflects concerns over the imbalance between employee and shareholder returns, including a year-on-year increase in the group bonus pool and compensation to income ratio against the backdrop of flat dividend, decline in adjusted profitability, returns on equity that did not cover the cost of equity, and a \u00a35.8 billion rights issue undertaken to improve capital adequacy. We understand the rationale behind the Board\u2019s decision to increase incentive pool in 2013, and appreciate the Board\u2019s commitment to continuing its repositioning journey and reducing the compensation to income ratio, but cannot support the implementation of the remuneration plan in 2013 because we believe that aggregate rewards to staff were excessive relative to performance.\u201d The High Pay Centre has congratulated the institutional shareholders, such as Standard Life, who voted against Barclays' remuneration report today. HPC director, Deborah Hargreaves, said the protest should spur Barclays to change its pay policies - rather than simply competing with big-spending US banks (who Sir David Walker blamed this morning for pushing up Barclays bonuses payments). She said: It's good to see major shareholders like Standard Life finally waking up to the fact that their customers are getting ripped off by the bankers\u2019 pay racket. They should keep up the pressure for a reform of the bonus policy and if top bankers threaten to leave Barclays should train up more people to take their place. The banks should also find other ways to reward people rather than outrageous bonuses. BREAKING: One in three Barclays investors has refused to back its pay report, in an embarrassing bloody nose for the bank over its decision to hike bankers' bonuses. The bank just announced that 7.1 million shares were cast in favour of the remuneration report, and 2.24m million opposed it. But a further 1.4m votes were withheld -- this is the traditional, old-school way that City investors show their displeasure without actually voting against a company. That means 34% of shareholders failed to back the pay plan, with 66% in favour. Most of the other resolutions were passed with majorities in the high 90%, including the one asking for permission to pay bonuses of up to 200% of basic pay. Here's all the details. World stock markets have fallen back this afternoon, as escalating tensions in Ukraine spook investors. The news that Russian troops have begun military exercises close to the Ukraine border wiped out the relief created by Apple and Facebook's strong results last night Germany's DAX has fallen over 1% -- many German companies have links to Russia -- while the FTSE 100 is now flat, having been up 30-odd points this morning. Our Ukraine liveblog has all the details: Ukraine: government troops move against pro-Russian separatists - live updates We're still waiting for the results of Barclays' shareholder votes. Reuters reckons it will \"easily win\" a binding vote on being allowed to pay up to twice the level of employees' salaries as bonuses, under new European Union rules. From the Royal Festival Hall, City editor Jill Treanor writes: Barclays faced shareholder scorn over its pay policies at an acrimonious annual general meeting today, where the board was accused of greed and major City investor Standard Life led the protests against a \u00a32.4bn bonus pot. Repeated attempts by the chairman Sir David Walker to insist bonus payouts were down on the previous year failed to quell repeated questioning about the pay deals for bankers. One private investor who expressed his irritation at the dividend, poor shareholder performance and \u00a35.8bn cash call last year, told the packed Royal Festival Hall: \"We're paying for Manchester United but we are getting Colchester United\". Such investor meetings are usually dominated by small shareholders but Standard Life spoke out to say it had voted against the remuneration policy..... Here's Jill's full story: Barclays AGM: investors protest over pay and bonuses Even by the standards of recent stormy shareholder events, that was quite a fiery annual general meeting. Barclays won't have enjoyed being told its bankers belong in jail, or being compared with a League One football club. But the more measured, public, criticism from Standard Life will probably have stung more. Here's a quick summary of the key points: Barclays has defended its decision to increase bonuses for its investment bankers despite a fall in profits last year, insisting that it had to pay more to attract and retain top staff. Sir David Walker, its chairman, insisted the move was done in the shareholders' best interests, and indicated it won't have to happen again. But the move was dramatically criticised by a major shareholder, Standard Life. It revealed it will vote against the bank's remuneration report, saying the 10% hike in bonuses can't be defended. Alison Kennedy, governance &amp; stewardship director at Standard Life Investments, said it was wrong to raise bonus payments rather than rewarding shareholders. She said: We are unconvinced that the amount of the 2013 bonus pool was in the best interests of shareholders, particularly when we consider how the bank's profits are divided amongst employees, shareholders and ongoing investment in the business. The dividend was unchanged in the year and an additional \u00a35.8bn of capital was raised from shareholders. We also believe that this decision has had negative repercussions on the bank's reputation. A series of small investors criticised Barclays -- one said that the bank was paying Manchester United wages for a Colchester United performance (although some of Man U's recent performances might have disgraced the mighty U's). Another accused it of corporate greed. A third said it was \"jam tomorrow\" for investors, but \"champagne today\" for the bankers. A fourth declared CEO Antony Jenkins should be removed. There were also protests outside the AGM, held at the Royal Festival Hall. ActionAid accused Barclays of helping firms dodge tax by locating overseas, while World Development Movement said the bank was helping to finance harmful coal mining overseas. Here's a picture gallery of the protests. Full coverage of the AGM starts here. The results of today's shareholder votes are due this afternoon. Before the meeting started, Barclays also warned the City that profits are down at its fixed-income arm. Back to the Royal Festival Hall, where Barclays chairman Sir David Walker has told reporters he is a little irritated with Standard Life for its public attack on the bank's pay policies. Excitement in the City -- Deloitte has just announced that it has been appointed as receivers for the Gherkin office tower. Here's the official statement: Phil Bowers and Neville Kahn of Deloitte, the business advisory firm, have today been appointed Joint Fixed Charge Receivers of 30 St Mary Axe, London. The building has been well leased since the initial default in 2009 and remains in trophy condition. The continuing defaults are due to the asset\u2019s complex, multicurrency capital structure. Adverse interest rate and currency movements have caused the total senior liabilities secured by the property to increase materially since closing. Neville Kahn, Joint Receiver and Restructuring Services Partner at Deloitte commented: \u201cThe Senior Lenders were reluctant to appoint a Receiver but felt they had no choice due to the ongoing defaults, which have remained uncured for over five years, and concerns that the Borrowers\u2019 lack of equity in the transaction had caused their incentives to become misaligned with the Lenders\u2019.\u201d Mr Kahn continued: \u201cThe Gherkin is a truly exceptional building, a landmark recognised around the globe. Our priority is to preserve the value of this asset. We are in the process of communicating with all tenants and working with the property manager to ensure the continuation of all property management services with no interruption to tenants.\u201d Here's a photo gallery of the demonstrations outside today's annual general meeting: Barclays hit by protests at AGM over pay and bonuses After a flurry of voting, that's the end of the AGM - and the Barclays board exit the room.... Barclays has heard enough! After almost two hours of virtual non-stop criticism from investors, Sir David Walker has called for a vote. But with 26 different resolutions on the table, this could take a while -- and I believe we don't get the full results straight away. Another investors tells Barclays that it should be paying higher dividends and smaller bonuses: A couple more highlights from the indefatigable Jill: (those allowances are designed to dodge the EU's rules that bonuses can't be more than 200% of basic salary) John Farmer, a small investor (and a regular attendee at AGMs for many years) has the floor - and accuses Barclays management of \"going native\" over bankers' pay. Barclays irate investors have dashed hopes that the Q&amp;A could be wrapped up by 1pm. That lunch will have to wait, Sir David..... Another investor points out that Barclays could have paid rather more to its shareholders if it had trimmed its bonus pot -- chairman Sir David Walker tries to butt in... Veteran fund manager, and Conservative Party donor, Patrick Evershed gets a heckling from fellow investors for standing up and defending Barclays' bonuses. One shareholder shouts out that someone should call a taxi for Evershed..... Another irate Barclays shareholder tells CEO Antony Jenkins he should leave the company: Correction, that question on mountain-top mining came from an organisation in West Virginia: Things are pretty tetchy.... Now Barclays is being accused of helping to finance ecologically harmful mining operations: Now ActionAid accuses Barclays of helping clients use overseas tax havens (I covered its concerns earlier). Juliet Samuel of The Times makes an excellent point -- it's vital that Standard Life goes public with its concerns about bonuses, rather than just having a cosy chat (as Sir John Sunderland appears to prefer) Most big shareholders have already cast their votes through the 'proxy' system - and the Barclays board are safe, it seems. The Times economics correspondent, Phil Aldrick, is stunned that Barclays told Standard Life not to express its concerns over bankers' bonuses at its own Annual General Meeting. Investors are hammering away at Barclays over its pay policies -- saying the bank's staff simply aren't worth the money. Here's the full text of Standard Life's dramatic comments at Barclays AGM, in which it revealed it would vote against the bank's remuneration report in protest at the decision to increase investment bank bonuses. My name is Alison Kennedy and I am a Governance &amp; Stewardship Director at Standard Life Investments which is a long term investor in Barclays Bank plc. On behalf of our clients, we have today instructed our proxy to vote against Resolution 2, the approval of the Remuneration Report. We did not take this decision lightly but, on balance, believe this was the right thing to do. We appreciate that there were competitive pressures during 2013, particularly in the Investment Banking business and that the board was seeking to protect a business franchise under threat. Nevertheless, we are unconvinced that the amount of the 2013 bonus pool was in the best interests of shareholders, particularly when we consider how the bank's profits are divided amongst employees, shareholders and ongoing investment in the business. The dividend was unchanged in the year and an additional \u00a35.8bn of capital was raised from shareholders. We also believe that this decision has had negative repercussions on the bank's reputation. I should make it clear that we have supported the resolutions to approve the forward-looking Remuneration Policy and to approve a limit on variable remuneration of 2 times fixed remuneration. Looking to the future, the board has stated its intention of reducing the compensation to net income ratio over the medium term. We support this intention and it is important that, over time, the board demonstrates convincingly that this will be achieved. However, we should like to see more clarity about the criteria the board will consider when determining the ratio. This would help set expectations and improve accountability as well as helping to restore trust. Will the board consider providing such clarity over the coming year? From the room, our City editor Jill Treanor says that Sir John Sunderland showed his irritation at facing her at the AGM, asked her to have made the remarks during the private consultations with big City investors. A Barclays investor puts the boot into the board, saying they are paying Premiership wages but getting a lower division performance. Much hilarity in the audience... Colchester are in the third tier of English football -- not sure how they feel about being compared to Barclays.... Barclays shareholders applaud loudly at the suggestion that the bank's entire remuneration committee should be sacked. Sir David Walker insists that the bank doesn't pay more than it has too -- but those in the Royal Festival Hall clearly aren't convinced. Sir John Sunderland responds to Standard Life's attack on bankers bonuses, saying it should have made its concerns in private, and insists bonuses fell last year (if you ignore the impact of 2012's Libor fines) Sunderland then asks whether Barclays pays too much -- investors shout \"yes\" back at him. ShareAction, the campaign group, says Sunderland is showing \"exactly\" why Barclays has problems.... Drama at the Barclays AGM: Standard Life has just declared that it will vote against the bank's pay policies. Standard Life representative says it cannot accept the decision to pay higher bonuses to investment bankers who generated much less profit last year. That's quite a (symbolic) slap in the face for the Barclays board, which had already tried to address criticism by replacing the head of the remuneration committee. As the FT explains here, City veteran Crawford Gillies is joining the Barclays board as a non-executive and will take over the helm of its remuneration committee from Sir John Sunderland. The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) has the floor, and arguing that Sir John Sunderland, the outgoing head of Barclays remuneration committee, shouldn't be allowed to lead the search for its next chairman. Walker insists that Sunderland is the right man for the job -- as he doesn't want the top job himself! LAPFF argues that Sunderland is the wrong choice, given he approved the controversial increase in bonuses in 2013 (details here). One shareholder accuses Barclays of a \"go to hell\" culture (throwing Antony Jenkins' slogan of being a \"go-to\" bank back in his face), over recent changes to overdrafts. Jenkins doesn't accept that that Barclays management is greedy.... Barclays board is now accused of \"management greed\" -- winning applause from other investors in the room. And we're off -- with the first shareholder asking whether Barclays could break up its investment bank. You'll find out next month when we publish our strategic review, Walker replies. Nearly time for Barclays investors to have their say -- David Walker hopes to crank though them by 1pm, so asks shareholders to avoid any speeches. But with 30 questions already lodged, he may have to wait for his lunchtime sandwiches... Jenkins is also insisting that Barclays investment banking arm is an \"important\" part of the mix in the company's future. He received polite applause at the end of his address. A cool reception for Antony Jenkins... ITV's Joel Hills has also been taking the temperature of Barclays investors. They're pretty chilly. And here's a snap of World Development Movement's protests over Barclays' funding for coal producers (details here). In a separate statement issued earlier this morning, Barclays warned that its first quarter profit had been hit by lower revenues from its fixed income operations. Here's the Reuters report: Barclays said its first-quarter profit fell after a \"significant\" drop in revenue from its investment bank's fixed- income operations, extending an industry slump across that business. A cost-cutting programme was starting to show a \"material benefit\", however, and would help offset the drop in investment bank profits. Barclays said it will report a \"small reduction\" in adjusted pretax profit compared with a year ago when it publishes first-quarter results on May 6. Most investment banks are expected to show income fell at the start of the year as bond and interest-rate trading struggled. \"Our fixed income, credit and commodities (FICC) business continued to face many of the challenges seen in the second half of 2013 with a significant year-on-year reduction in FICC income, reflecting difficult market conditions and a strong comparative performance for Q1 last year,\" Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins said. Barclays chief executive, Antony Jenkins, is addressing the AGM now. His message to shareholders that he is \"impatient\" to sort the bank out. He insists the bank isn't complacent: I am impatient to deliver the performance, and the dividend, you deserve - sustainable, predictable performance though the whole cycle. I am impatient to drive forward our cost reduction programme. And I am impatient to see growth across the Group. Of course, we face significant challenges. I said at the time of Transform that progress would not be uniform or linear in a programme of this scale and ambition. That's from the statement released to the stock market a few minutes ago. Sir David Walker also told Barclays shareholders that he doesn't expect to raise bonuses again if bankers haven't really earned it: He says: A core parameter for the intensive review of strategy for the bank that we are now close to concluding is that the investment bank has to deliver on a sustainable basis the performance and returns profile which our shareholders rightly expect. On this basis your board and I do not intend or expect to face again a similar set of circumstances that led to the very difficult decisions we had to take last year. He also argues that the bonus pool actually fell last year, if you ignore the fact that some bonuses were withheld in 2012 because of the Libor scandal. Barclays chairman Sir David Walker is defending the decision to increase bonuses by 10% to \u00a32.4bn in 2013 (even though the bank's profits fell by 32%). He told shareholders that \"the decision on pay this year was among the hardest that we have had to take\", but insisted that it was in the company's best interests. With the resignation rate for senior employees in the US almost doubling in 2013, Barclays board decided it had to boost pay to retain staff. Here's the key line: But we were faced last year, 2013, with a situation in which we were losing people who were crucial to the future of the investment bank in an extremely competitive environment in which total pay in some parts of the major US investment banks rose by 15% or more. Our resignation rate for senior employees in the US almost doubled in 2013. We saw significantly higher numbers of high quality people we wanted to recruit turning down our offers. In this situation, where there is a genuine threat to the health of the franchise, our duty of care is to protect value for shareholders. The challenge was the need for damage limitation and franchise protection. The Companies Act is clear on this point. The statutory role of your board - and I quote - is to \"promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole\". That was the test we applied when we considered this most difficult of decisions. We took our decision on bonuses in the firm belief that it was in the best long-term interests of shareholders to protect key franchises in the bank through this difficult phase of transition. Despite all the reservations that have been expressed, I remain confident in my view that we took the right decision. The full statement is online here. Walker also told investors that he shares their pain: I imagine his monthly pay cheque softens the blow, though The Barclays AGM is underway, even though people are still queuing to get in. Here we go! Small shareholders are also unhappy with Barclays, over the bonuses paid to its investment bankers last year. The UK Shareholders Association has asked Barclays to explain how it is meeting its legal obligations to shareholders, given dividends are lagging far behind bankers' pay rises. Back in February, it demanded answers in a letter to chairmen Sir David Walker. It's online here. Here's a flavour: UKSA has noted the results statement put out by Barclays showing how it has performed for 2013. That statement shows, inter alia, that the profit before tax is down 32% from 2012 and that the return on shareholders\u2019 equity has halved from 9% to 4.5%, but you have increased the bonus pool for your investment bankers by \u00a3210 million and the compensation ratio for the investment bank has gone up from 39.6% to 43.2%. That statement also shows that the total dividend for 2013 will be 6.5p per share. This compares with 34.0p per share paid for 2008, a reduction of 81%. The World Development Movement accuses Barclays of fuelling climate change by providing over \u00a33bn of funding to coal producers. Two protesters dressed as Barclay's \"Eagles\" (its corporate logo) are cycling outside the Royal Festival Hall on London's for-hire bikes with coal stuffed in the front . World Development accuse Barclays of sticking with coal when other banks have pulled out. They say: Coalburning releases more greenhouse gases per tonne than any other fossil fuel, driving climate change which disproportionately affects the world\u2019s poorest people. In Indonesia, Barclays has loaned \u00a3127 million to mining company Bumi Resources, responsible for evicting indigenous people in Indonesian Borneo from their land. Since 2009, it has also loaned \u00a31.6 billion to BHP Billiton, which plans to open coal mines across a vast area of the Borneo rainforest. Barclays was also the top global financer of \u2018mountaintop removal\u2019 coal mining in 2013. The tops of more than 500 mountains in the USA have been blasted off for coal. Banks JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BNP Paribas have pulled out of mountaintop removal, but Barclays has increased its financing of the practice, closing \u00a3327 million in loan and bond transactions in 2013. Another group of protestors, urging Barclays not to help companies avoid tax: Even Barclays own shareholders are in a bad mood, it seems: Protesters are also accusing Barclays of helping clients set up in offshore tax havens, depriving developing nations of funds. Here's the scene: Tom Fyans, head of campaigns for ActionAid, accuses Barclays of hurting the world's poorest people to make profits for its bankers: \u201cThe winners at this year\u2019s AGM are likely to be Barclays\u2019 hugely expensive fleet of investment bankers who plan to award themselves millions of pounds in bonuses. But the losers will be people in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries. \u201cBarclays continues to help businesses operating in poor African countries set up in known tax havens. As long as it continues to do this \u2013 Antony Jenkins\u2019 promise that his bank is \u201cchanging\u201d looks increasingly hollow.\u201d Over in London, protesters have gathered outside the Royal Festival Hall to protest against Barclays as the bank prepares to hold its annual general meeting. Aid campaigners, and those pushing for a financial transaction tax, are demonstrating, as my colleague Jill Treanor reports. ShareAction, another campaign group, are also there - and report that the protests are \"peaceful and fun\" protests. There's a strong Robin Hood theme.... We'll be tracking the action for the next few hours.... Speaking of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi is telling an audience in Amsterdam that the ECB could launch a \"broad-based\" asset purchase programme if the inflation outlook were to worsen. He also said that the ECB could cut interest rates if tensions in the bond market reared up (tightening monetary policy), or launch a \"longer-term refinancing operation to encourage bank lending\". Lots of possibilities, there, but no concrete action. Spain just sold \u20ac5.6bn of bonds at the lowest interest rates since the euro was created, according to Reuters. That included a three-year bond, at an average yield of just 1.022%, and a 10-year bond at just 3.059%. More encouraging news for Spain after its growth forecast (see 9.32am). It's also further proof that the risk of default has been eroded away. and that investors expect the European Central Bank to act to stimulate the economy and avoid a deflationary slump. The current low inflation rates have also been credited with driving the eurozone debt rally --- with prices rising at just 0.5% per year, the current low yields look more attractive. Apple and Facebook's strong results are going to push shares higher on Wall Street when trading begins in under five hours. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is being called up more than 1%, in the future's market, with the Dow and S&amp;P also expected to rise. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, says last night's earnings reports have \"certainly served to boost sentiment as far as futures markets go and we're looking at sizable gains for Wall Street at the open.\" Results from Caterpillar, Microsoft, Coca-Cola and GM could chance the picture, of course.... AstraZeneca is holding a conference call with financial reports now, and refusing to discuss the reports that America's Pfizer has considered launching a massive \u00a360bn bid. Interesting developments over at Britain's troubled Co-op Group --The Labour party is considering severing its commercial relationship. Labour has a loan worth more than \u00a31m with the Co-op Bank, and may now switch itto trade union-owned Unity Trust Bank. But as politics editor Patrick Wintour explains, it's not clear if Labour is jumping or being pushed.... A spokesman said that any move had not yet been finalised, adding: \"The Labour party is constantly reviewing its financial arrangements. All decisions are taken for commercial reasons.\" It is not clear the extent to which Labour has initiated the shift or whether the Co-op bank is itself encouraging the move as part of a wider attempt by the bank to loosen, and ultimately sever, its complex historic relations to the Labour party. More here: Labour and Co-op Bank may sever ties The relief over Apple and Facebook's results has helped to push the FTSE 100 to a six-week high, up 35 points to 6710. That's its highest level since March 11, as investors continue to welcome both companies' forecast-beating sales and profits. The blue chip index is being led by drugs firm (and potential bid target) AstraZeneca, whose shares are up 3.5% after it reported good progress with new anti-cancer drugs. Mining giant Anglo American are up 3%, after posting a rise in output (apart from in Platinum, where ongoing strikes have hit production) Unilever, though, is dragging down the market. Its shares have fallen 1.2% after reporting a 6.3% drop in revenues. It is also looking for buyers for its SlimFast brand and north American pasta sauces business - full story. German companies have shrugged off the Ukraine crisis, with business sentiment in the eurozone's largest economy rising this month. The business climate index, conducted by Munich thinktank IFO, rose to 111.2 from 110.7 in March. Firms said that their business expectations had risen this month (at 107.3 from 106.4), while current conditions are a little better too (115.3 from 115.2). Spain's economic recovery has picked up pace this quarter, according to its central bank's new forecast. The Bank of Spain predicted that GDP rose by 0.4% in the first three months of 2014, twice as rapidly as in the final quarter of 2013. If they're right (and we find out at the end of April) it's another signal that the eurozone economy is putting the ravages of the debt crisis behind it. But 0.4% growth isn't enough to make much impact in Spain's jobless total, where one in four adults are our of work. Shares in German chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor, whose semiconductors are used in iPhones, have surged 6% this morning on the back of Apple's strong results. Apple's forecast-beating smartphone sales bode well for Dialog, explains DZ Bank analyst Harald Schnitzer who told clients: \"Good news for Dialog Semiconductor. The product pipeline with Apple remains well filled.\" Worth noting that France's Alstom did issue a somewhat cagey statement following the reports that GE could be planning a major takeover bid: \"In response to recent speculation in the economic press, Alstom is not informed of any potential public tender offer for the shares of the company\". As fastFT points out, that's hardly a full-throated denial, and doesn't mean that talks haven't taken place between the two boardrooms... Takeover fever has reached the Paris stock market today -- shares in French turbine and train maker Alstom have jumped 11% this morning, on reports that General Electric is planning a $13bn bid. Ishaq Siddiqi of ETX Capital explains on why Facebook and Apple's shares jumped by 4% and 7% respectively in after-hours trading*: Facebook\u2019s mobile business was the standout performer, pleasing market participants who were once unsure how FB will monitize itself appropriately. Clearly, mobile advertising is where the real growth is for the company who reported a 59% jump in the period as monthly active mobile users passed 1 billion. Facebook beat on other metrics too; revenues were better while earnings per share doubled \u2013 no wonder Zuckerberg was happy to splash out on big money purchases of WhatsApp and Oculus VR. Meanwhile, Apple pleased the market with better than expected iPhone sales, particularly in China which represented a 17% jump in total unit sales. Following three or so quarters of underwhelming iPhone sales, the market was fearful the tech giant will again disappoint but that was not the case. Additionally, the company is returning more than $30billion to shareholders in its capital return programme whilst increasing the dividend. Furthermore, the product pipeline brings further cheer \u2013 iPhone6 is expected this year as well as a reported \u2018phablet\u2019 and a potential iWatch. * - Silicon Valley firms traditionally report their earnings once the New York stock market has shut, due to the three-hour time gap. Britain doesn't (alas) have tech companies to match Facebook or Apple, but shares in some of our smaller IT companies are rallying. Imagination Technologies, the UK semiconductor developer, has seen its shares jump 5% this morning, while set-top box maker Pace are up 4%. And our biggest tech firm, ARM Holdings, has risen over 1%. All three firms had suffered this year as investors began worrying that the technology sector was entering another bubble (although comparisons with the crazy dot-com days, when companies were floating with little more than ideas and potential, feel daft) Apple and Facebook's forecast-beating results have given European stock markets a lift this morning. Here's the early prices: FTSE 100: up 31 points at 6706, +0.5% Germany's DAX: up 48 points at 9593, +0.5% France's CAC: up 26 points at 4477, +0.6% CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson confirms that tech crash jitters have been balmed, but flags up that Facebook is still very highly valued compared to its current earning: Concerns about a fall in Apple's revenues proved to be unfounded as they came in at $45.6bn, above the downgraded number of $44bn that prompted the sell-off seen at the end of January, but the company did nudge down its guidance outlook for the remainder of the year. Facebook shares also rose sharply after the company reported a rise in sales of 72% for the first three months of 2014, as mobile advertising continued to pay dividends, assuaging concerns that the company wouldn\u2019t be able to generate significant revenues. The only question remains as to whether this type of growth, good as it is, merits a forward valuation of 50. Welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. There's a palpable sense of relief in the markets this morning as decent results from both Facebook and Apple calm fears that the technology sector is heading for a crash, and sent their own shares surging in after-hours trading in New York. The two US tech titans both gave analyst forecasts a drubbing last night, with strong increases in both revenues and profits, just a day after activist investor David Einhorn declared that it was \"clear\" that the tech sector was in a bubble. Facebook, though, reported a 72% surge in revenues to $2.5bn -- driven by strong growth in its mobile business -- with profits all-but-tripling over the last three months. Almost half the world's internet users are now on the social network site, it declared, as it blew past analyst forecasts for the fourth quarter in a row. Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, summed up the mood: \u201cQuarter after quarter Facebook has fairly easily beaten expectations...They clearly have a handle on their mobile business.\u201d More here: Facebook quarterly earnings soar on mobile platform success Apple was on song too -- with revenues of $45.6bn, well above analysts expectations of $43.5bn, and a 17% leap in iPhones sales (although iPad sales missed forecasts). It also boosted its share buyback by $30bn (making a small dent in its cash pile), and also announced a 7-1 stock split which could make its stock more tempting to small investors. More here: Apple profits surprise investors as company launches charm offensive Wall Street loved the look of both results; Facebook shares surged 4% in after-hours trading, while Apple romped over 7% higher. And that's likely to give European markets a lift this morning too. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains: US futures got a boost after hours from Apple and Facebook earnings reports - investors welcoming a boost to the latter\u2019s payout programme (stock buyback +30%, dividend +8%). Amazon and Microsoft report their own results tonight, which could give further clues on whether tech valuations have been driven too high. But for now, there's optimism that companies are delivering the goods. Construction and mining equipment giant Caterpillar also reports its results today -- often a good insight into the state of the global economy. As IG's Chris Weston says: Caterpillar is one of the few companies globally that report earnings that can have implications on other asset classes. While in London, Barclays AGM is going to be a lively affair - with protests over bankers' pay and its activities in the development world. And in Europe, ECB president Mario Draghi is giving a speech in Amsterdam this morning to mark the 200th anniversary of the Dutch central bank. I'll be tracking all the developments through the day....",

    "webTitle": "Angela Ahrendts' start date at Apple leaves Burberry investors confused", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts is to take up her new post as head of Apple's retail empire next week, raising the prospect that she could forfeit an \u00a38m bonus. The British fashion label originally warned investors that Ahrendts could start her job at Apple by mid-2014, with the company suggesting she was likely to stay on to collect two major share awards that are due to mature on 6 June. But on Wednesday night, announcing Apple's financial results, chief executive Tim Cook said he was \"looking forward to welcoming our new retail and online leader Angela Ahrendts, who will be joining Apple's executive team next week\". The news led to confusion in London, with Burberry declining to confirm the date of her departure to investors. The label's design boss Christopher Bailey is chief executive in waiting, but no announcement has been made to the London Stock Exchange confirming the change. The delay suggests negotiations over a settlement for Ahrendts are going to the wire. It is understood an announcement will be made when Burberry's board has reached a decision. The American executive, who oversaw Burberry's transformation from a smart rainwear company into a sought-after international fashion label, is returning to her homeland after nine years in London. She resigned in October and has now completed a six-month notice period. In June she would be due to collect shares worth more than \u00a37.6m at today's \u00a314.42 share price. Apple declined to comment on whether it had offered to compensate Ahrendts for any loss of bonus, but her financial rewards at the world's biggest technology company are likely to be generous. She will be the only female member of the Californian company's 10-strong leadership team but will not have a seat on the main board, where Cook is the only executive director. When in 2012 Cook recruited former Dixons boss John Browett to run his retail arm, the British executive was handed a golden hello of 100,000 Apple shares, worth $57m at the time. These were due to vest over a five-year period, but Browett's stay at Apple was brief. He left the company after six months, and collected 5,000 shares from the original award \u2013 but at $610 apiece he walked away with $3m. Ahrendts will have a wider remit than her predecessor, overseeing more than 420 high street stores in 15 countries and online sales via the Apple website, which retails in 39 countries. Apple's pared back, steel-and-glass shops had more in common with art galleries than with the overflowing electronics outlets found on most high streets when they first appeared in 2001. They earn more per square foot than any other retail chain in the world, but have in effect been leaderless since 2011, when Browett's predecessor Ron Johnson left for US group JC Penney after building up Apple's retail presence during his 11-year tenure. Despite a vacuum at the top, Apple stores earned a record $7bn (\u00a35bn) in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 9% on the same period last year. They attracted 114m visitors during the quarter, about 21,000 visitors per store, per week.",

    "webTitle": "AstraZeneca shareholders revolt over pay", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca suffered one of the biggest shareholder revolts over executive pay yesterday when 40% of those voting at the pharmaceutical group's annual general meeting failed to back its remuneration report. The company suffered further blows at the meeting when 31% failed to back its proposed pay policy for the next three years and 43% voted against the re-election of Jean-Philippe Courtois, a non-executive director on its audit committee, after he failed to turn up for board and audit committee meetings. The revolt against the remuneration report came after chief executive Pascal Soriot's basic pay was increased by 3% to \u00a31.13m for the current year while he could earn a further \u00a34.35m in share and cash bonuses. Soriot's predecessor, David Brennan, was ousted in the shareholder spring of 2012 after a row over his \u00a39m 2011 pay deal and underperformance at Britain's second biggest drugmaker. Pirc, the shareholder advisory body, which said investors should vote against AstraZeneca's remuneration report, appeared to give a warning to other companies considering hefty director pay deals. A spokesman said: \"Pirc is concerned about the general level of remuneration and some of the remuneration structures at large companies and we will continue to oppose excessive remuneration policies.\" Investors have become markedly more active in expressing their disapproval of executive pay with a string of revolts since spring 2012 that as well as forcing out Brennan claimed the scalp of Andrew Moss at insurance company Aviva. A spokesperson for AstraZeneca said: \"We are disappointed with today's vote and it is our priority to carefully analyse it and talk to our shareholders to fully understand any concerns. \"We held a consultation meeting with our major shareholders in December 2013 at which we outlined our approach to our remuneration policy. Prior to today's vote we have had only limited active feedback from shareholders on the topic of remuneration in the run-up to the AGM.\" AstraZeneca shares rose 3.3% to \u00a341.75 on Thursday. The rebellion came as Soriot fired a warning shot across the bows of bigger US rival Pfizer, a potential suitor, as he insisted that the British drugmaker's strategy was working and highlighted progress with new cancer drugs. AstraZeneca is said to have received a tentative $100bn approach from Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker. While Soriot did not comment directly on the bid, he said that \"large mergers and acquisitions sometimes can work but often are very disruptive\". He lauded the multibillion-dollar asset swap unveiled by GlaxoSmithKline and Switzerland's Novartis on Tuesday as a \"win-win for both companies\", adding: \"It is certainly the kind of thing we ourselves are considering.\" The future of AstraZeneca's antibiotics and neuroscience divisions is under review as analysts predicted that the group could raise $15bn from a disposal programme. \"What you are likely to see from us is a continued focus on what we do well \u2026 We can't do everything ourselves. There are a variety of options open to us which we are studying right now,\" Soriot said. The drugmaker is moving four important products into late-stage clinical testing, two for cancer and two for breathing disorders, including the first of its closely watched immunotherapy cancer treatments. AstraZeneca sales in the first quarter rose 3% to $6.42bn at constant exchange rates \u2013 the first quarterly sales growth in over three years \u2013 with revenues in China surging 22%. But pre-tax profits fell 18% to $1.82bn, and by 13% at constant exchange rates. AstraZeneca still expects a single digit percentage decline in 2014 sales as competition from cheap generic medicines will hurt sales of its top-selling heartburn pill Nexium in the US from May. Mick Cooper, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said: \"These numbers highlight why the interest [from Pfizer] is there. AstraZeneca has been in transition, with much business and product development under way but little as yet is really visible. We think AstraZeneca will return to growth faster than many believe, which underlines Pfizer's opportune timing.\"",

He lauded the multibillion-dollar asset swap unveiled by GlaxoSmithKline and Switzerland's Novartis on Tuesday as a \"win-win for both companies\", adding: \"It is certainly the kind of thing we ourselves are considering.\"</p> <p>The future of AstraZeneca's antibiotics and neuroscience divisions is under review as analysts predicted that the group could raise $15bn from a disposal programme. \"What you are likely to see from us is a continued focus on what we do well \u2026 We can't do everything ourselves. There are a variety of options open to us which we are studying right now,\" Soriot said.</p> <p>The drugmaker is moving four important products into late-stage clinical testing, two for cancer and two for breathing disorders, including the first of its closely watched immunotherapy cancer treatments.</p> <p>AstraZeneca sales in the first quarter rose 3% to $6.42bn at constant exchange rates \u2013 the first quarterly sales growth in over three years \u2013 with revenues in China surging 22%. But pre-tax profits fell 18% to $1.82bn, and by 13% at constant exchange rates. AstraZeneca still expects a single digit percentage decline in 2014 sales as competition from cheap generic medicines will hurt sales of its top-selling heartburn pill Nexium in the US from May.</p> <p>Mick Cooper, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said: \"These numbers highlight why the interest [from Pfizer] is there. AstraZeneca has been in transition, with much business and product development under way but little as yet is really visible. We think AstraZeneca will return to growth faster than many believe, which underlines Pfizer's opportune timing.\"</p>",

The struggling food retailer, which has admitted to being damaged by the crisis at the Co-operative Bank, said the move was part of an ongoing commitment to lower prices on hundreds of everyday essential items. On Tuesday, market leader Tesco dropped the price of more than 30 staples including bacon, eggs and sugar, as part of chief executive Philip Clarke's pledge to offer more \"stable\" prices, as it faces fierce competition from discount chains Aldi and Lidl. Co-op said the first wave of price cuts would include groceries such as bread, milk, eggs, chicken, bacon and bananas. \"Our plans are challenging yet achievable,\" said its retail chief executive, Steve Murrells, who is leading a turnaround at the 2,800-store chain. \"By introducing permanent price reductions on hundreds of key product lines, we are further responding to the needs of local people in providing them with a compelling and truly convenient shopping experience.\" The retailer is bringing its prices in line with rival convenience chains, and the new reductions are on top of price cuts across 1,000 products last year. Like the big four supermarkets, the Co-op has been losing market share to Aldi and Lidl. It controlled 6.1% of the market in the 12 weeks to 30 March, down from 6.2% a year ago. Part of the troubled Co-operative Group, the chain turned over \u00a37.2bn last year, down from \u00a37.4bn. Underlying operating profit fell from \u00a3269m to \u00a3247m. The pricing initiative is supported by a high-profile TV advertising campaign with the tagline \"fair &amp; square prices\". Murrells said the price cuts were not being funded by suppliers but from \"significant ongoing efficiencies and cost reductions being made by the business\".",

Analyst Mark Brumby at Langton Capital said:</p> <blockquote> As has been the case for some time, Spirit Group has benefited from a degree of self-help in that, post its split from Punch Taverns, it has been able to undertake a programme of refurbishments and capital expenditure in addition to which it has a sizeable London estate, where the market is very strong. <br> Fourth quarter comparisons will be tough given 2013's good summer but the group is estimated to make in the region of \u00a356.3m (6.6p of earnings) in the current year suggesting that its shares trade on a current year multiple of around 11.9 times falling to 11.2 times next year.  This represents very fair to good value although some observers will point to the group's accumulated catch-up capital spending with the implication being that some of the group's recent growth has been purchased. </blockquote> <p>Karl Burns at Panmure Gordon was also positive:</p> <blockquote> Following the update we increase our 2014 forecasts by 2% to \u00a357m. We retain our buy recommendation and 110p price target, highlighting the discount to its peer group and the continued positive momentum from the investment within the pub estate driving higher sales and margins. </blockquote>",

Later in the statement it added that it expected conditions to remain \"challenging.\" But the general tone of the update has lifted Spirit 2.75p to 81.25p. Analyst Mark Brumby at Langton Capital said: As has been the case for some time, Spirit Group has benefited from a degree of self-help in that, post its split from Punch Taverns, it has been able to undertake a programme of refurbishments and capital expenditure in addition to which it has a sizeable London estate, where the market is very strong. Fourth quarter comparisons will be tough given 2013's good summer but the group is estimated to make in the region of \u00a356.3m (6.6p of earnings) in the current year suggesting that its shares trade on a current year multiple of around 11.9 times falling to 11.2 times next year. This represents very fair to good value although some observers will point to the group's accumulated catch-up capital spending with the implication being that some of the group's recent growth has been purchased. Karl Burns at Panmure Gordon was also positive: Following the update we increase our 2014 forecasts by 2% to \u00a357m. We retain our buy recommendation and 110p price target, highlighting the discount to its peer group and the continued positive momentum from the investment within the pub estate driving higher sales and margins.",

Among the tech stocks edging higher in the wake of the Apple boom are Arm - which fell on Wednesday following its own update but has recovered 1p to 957p - and Imagination Technologies, up 15p at 198.8p. Laird, which supplies components to Apple and Samsung, has added 5p to 292.5p. On Arm, analyst Vijay Anand at Espirito Santo said: With licensing ahead but royalties lower, Arm's first quarter results followed the pattern seen in the third and fourth quarters. More importantly, supported by industry data points along with weaker comparisons, Arm expects a strong second half and now has increased confidence in its full-year royalty revenue growth guidance of around 19%. With the stock range-bound for the last 15 months, a pick-up in royalty revenue growth, similar to the first half of 2012, is likely to act as a positive catalyst, in our view. While foreign exchange drives a 3%-4% reduction to our 2014 to 2016 earnings per share forecasts, our fair value of 1,250p, offering over 30% upside potential, is unchanged. Buy. But Unilever has lost 36p to \u00a325.98 despite better then expected first quarter sales despite a later Easter holiday, with a continuing slowdown in emerging markets. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 35.23 points at 6709.97. Among the other risers easyJet has added 33p to \u00a317.19 as Morgan Stanley issued an overweight rating and raised its price target from \u00a318.30 to \u00a318.55. The bank said: EasyJet is benefiting from clear strength in cross-border EU market. It has highlighted strong opportunities for profitable growth in countries such as UK, France, Italy and Switzerland. Allocated seating provides incremental revenue. This initiative delivered \u00a30.51 per seat uplift in 2013. With no cost attached, this revenue drops straight to pretax profit. Costs [are] under control....There is fruitful opportunity for cost save in engineering and maintenance with 95% of the annual spend up for retender by 2015. We find valuation is still attractive [and the] dividend adds to attraction. We forecast a 3% yield in 2015 in a sector where we expect few carriers to deliver a payout. Morgan Stanley is also positive on British Airways and Iberia owner International Airlines Group, up 11p at 418.3p. It said: [The] pre-Easter sell-off was aggressive with IAG losing 15% in 10 days. This is despite no company specific newsflow or signs of changes to IAG earnings drivers. After a first quarter of underperformance, and indeed negative year to date performance versus 20%-45% at peers, we see grounds for investor sentiment to turn positive from here into 9 May first quarter earnings. Free cashflow yield on our 2015 estimate is a healthy 16% post capital expenditure and in a year when we expect IAG to initiate a dividend payout.",

      "body": "<p>The inflation figures for the March quarter released on Wednesday by the<a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/6401.0Main%20Features1Mar%202014?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=6401.0&amp;issue=Mar%202014&amp;num=&amp;view=\"> Australian bureau of statistics</a> were lower than expected by everyone except the Reserve Bank. They confirmed that the RBA\u2019s position to keep interest rates on hold will continue for some time and, for the moment at least, eased the upward pressure on the dollar.<br></p> <p>Earlier this week the<a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/national/joe_hockey_tells_rba_he_not_happy_EHENqcPuMSgxA1Uk88ANVI\"> Australian Financial Review\u2019s Laura Tingle</a> reported that the treasurer, Joe Hockey, had contacted the Reserve Bank to tell it of his displeasure with its \u201cneutral bias\u201d that suggests the RBA thinks there is no longer any need to lower rates. His displeasure is rooted in his belief that lower interest rates would help reduce the value of the dollar as this would assist manufacturers and other export-exposed industries.</p> <p>Hockey\u2019s actions do not explicitly undermine the independence of the Reserve Bank, but they certainly don\u2019t promote it. The last thing you would want is for the market to believe that the treasurer could strong-arm the RBA. Fortunately, no one thinks it remotely likely that the governor of the RBA, Glenn Stevens, would listen to Hockey.</p> <p>It is hard to credit a treasurer who is complaining at a time when rates are at record lows when he for so long predicted rising interest rates under the former government. And the dollar, while high, remains well below the level Wayne Swan had to deal with when treasurer.</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps not that surprising that Hockey would have a bit of a sook about the RBA, given since becoming treasurer he has frequently found others to blame for his problem. He has even blamed the ALP for the \u201c<a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2Fad6e1917-440e-4f90-acad-16d2af135e93%2F0167%22\">deteriorating terms of trade</a>\u201d (really \u2013 is the ALP at fault for falling world iron ore prices?).</p> <p>Hockey\u2019s annoyance with the RBA is that in February it changed from an \u201ceasing bias\u201d to a \u201cneutral bias\u201d. In essence the bank shifted from saying it was prepared to cut rates should the need arise, to now suggesting that the growth in the economy and inflation meant the need to cut no longer existed and that rates should stay where they are. </p> <p>But even with record low rates the problem is that the RBA still cannot get the dollar below 90 cents for any long period because the US and Japan continue to run a very loose monetary policy. And lowering rates as Hockey would wish might not even achieve a lower dollar, but would likely push up inflation.</p> <p>Stevens told the House of Representatives economics committee<a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=COMMITTEES;id=committees%2Fcommrep%2Fdba4107d-f4cc-422c-baef-407c89c396ad%2F0001;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Fcommrep%2Fdba4107d-f4cc-422c-baef-407c89c396ad%2F0000%22\"> last month</a> that while you could try to lower the exchange rate by lowering interest rates or intervening in the foreign exchange market, the \u201cbiggest thing you could do if you really want to lower the exchange rate, is have a weak economy and say that you do not want foreign investment\u201d.</p> <p>He also said that another way to get interest rates down would be \u201cif fiscal policy is quite contractionary and that slows down the economy\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The inflation figures for the March quarter released on Wednesday by the Australian bureau of statistics were lower than expected by everyone except the Reserve Bank. They confirmed that the RBA\u2019s position to keep interest rates on hold will continue for some time and, for the moment at least, eased the upward pressure on the dollar. Earlier this week the Australian Financial Review\u2019s Laura Tingle reported that the treasurer, Joe Hockey, had contacted the Reserve Bank to tell it of his displeasure with its \u201cneutral bias\u201d that suggests the RBA thinks there is no longer any need to lower rates. His displeasure is rooted in his belief that lower interest rates would help reduce the value of the dollar as this would assist manufacturers and other export-exposed industries. Hockey\u2019s actions do not explicitly undermine the independence of the Reserve Bank, but they certainly don\u2019t promote it. The last thing you would want is for the market to believe that the treasurer could strong-arm the RBA. Fortunately, no one thinks it remotely likely that the governor of the RBA, Glenn Stevens, would listen to Hockey. It is hard to credit a treasurer who is complaining at a time when rates are at record lows when he for so long predicted rising interest rates under the former government. And the dollar, while high, remains well below the level Wayne Swan had to deal with when treasurer. It\u2019s perhaps not that surprising that Hockey would have a bit of a sook about the RBA, given since becoming treasurer he has frequently found others to blame for his problem. He has even blamed the ALP for the \u201cdeteriorating terms of trade\u201d (really \u2013 is the ALP at fault for falling world iron ore prices?). Hockey\u2019s annoyance with the RBA is that in February it changed from an \u201ceasing bias\u201d to a \u201cneutral bias\u201d. In essence the bank shifted from saying it was prepared to cut rates should the need arise, to now suggesting that the growth in the economy and inflation meant the need to cut no longer existed and that rates should stay where they are. But even with record low rates the problem is that the RBA still cannot get the dollar below 90 cents for any long period because the US and Japan continue to run a very loose monetary policy. And lowering rates as Hockey would wish might not even achieve a lower dollar, but would likely push up inflation. Stevens told the House of Representatives economics committee last month that while you could try to lower the exchange rate by lowering interest rates or intervening in the foreign exchange market, the \u201cbiggest thing you could do if you really want to lower the exchange rate, is have a weak economy and say that you do not want foreign investment\u201d. He also said that another way to get interest rates down would be \u201cif fiscal policy is quite contractionary and that slows down the economy\u201d. So if Hockey were to slam on the brakes in the May budget he may get his wish, because this would force the RBA to cut rates to try to resuscitate the economy. Fortunately his wish for a lower dollar may come true without such measures, because the inflation figures released yesterday were below expectations and showed that the RBA\u2019s \u201cneutral bias\u201d position is largely correct. While the headline CPI rate came in at 2.9%, which is right at the top of the 2%-3% band within which the RBA targets inflation, the market expected 3.2%. The market reacted to the release of the data by selling off the dollar, which saw its value fall nearly 1% from US$0.9375 to US$0.9285. The inflation figures the RBA uses of the trimmed mean and weightier median also showed little to suggest the RBA would raise rates soon: Crucially, the biggest driver of the inflation rate is that of \u201ctradeables\u201d \u2013 items for which the prices are largely determined overseas. They have risen sharply in the past year as the dollar has fallen from above parity with the US dollar. But the annual growth of the non-tradeables (items for which the prices are determined in Australia \u2013 such as education, housing prices, childcare, electricity) is at its lowest point since December 2009: That certainly doesn\u2019t suggest an overheating economy in need of the RBA raising rates. The market continues to predict a rate rise next year, but the time frame has shifted. In February the next rate rise was expected in April or May 2015; now it is expected only in June or July 2015: When we look at individual items, the data confirms what I wrote last year when I suggested the Liberal party \u201cdodged the big bullet of electricity prices\u201d by not being in power from 2007-13, and that \u201cwe should observe smaller price increases than in the past six years\u201d.
