      "bodyText": "To put it mildly, the Labour party\u2019s relationship with the International Monetary Fund has not always been a happy one. Memories of 1976, when an IMF team forced Jim Callaghan\u2019s government to cut public spending in return for an emergency loan, are powerful to this day. So when shadow chancellor John McDonnell was drawing up the tax plans included in Labour\u2019s general election manifesto, the IMF would have been a long way down the list of organisations from which he might have expected an endorsement. Yet, in its latest fiscal monitor, that is precisely what the IMF has done. Not explicitly, of course. The report is careful not to say which countries should be thinking about raising the top rate of tax. Still less does it say that the right level should be the 50% proposed by Labour. But that doesn\u2019t really matter because what the IMF has done is provide some high-level support for Labour\u2019s basic approach. The fiscal monitor notes that tax systems have become less good at offsetting inequality during a period when the average marginal rate of income tax in western countries has been cut from 62% to 35%. The justification for allowing the rich to keep more of their income has always been that it is good for growth because lower tax means more risk-taking, more entrepreneurship and higher growth. Yet there is no evidence that making life sweeter for the rich has done anything other than make them richer. Trickle-down economics is bunk. To be clear, the IMF is not saying that it would be a good idea to return to the 1970s peak of an income tax rate of 83%. But it is saying the rich could pay more tax without hindering growth, provided the increase is not excessive. Even with that caveat, that conclusion is extremely welcome for Labour.",

      "bodyText": "Planning officials have ruled that Westminster council should reject plans by the multimillionaire owner of Classic FM to create the country\u2019s most expensive flat. Ashley Tabor, 40, had hoped to knock together two properties at the top of the luxury Knightsbridge Apartments complex to create a \u00a3200m penthouse flat with 10 bedrooms, a cinema, \u201cbutler\u2019s pantry\u201d and \u201cservice kitchen\u201d. But Westminster\u2019s director of planning on Wednesday recommended that Tabor\u2019s plan should be rejected because of the council\u2019s policy against merging homes. The council\u2019s planning committee will vote on the project on 17 October. To create the huge apartment, which could have been one of London\u2019s most expensive homes, Tabor bought the flat next door to his existing residence in the block for \u00a390m earlier this year. He bought his first flat in the luxury block, which is a stone\u2019s throw from Harrods and popular with wealthy Russian and Middle Eastern families, for \u00a315m in 2006. In his application, submitted by luxury planning firm Gerald Eve, Tabor said he needed \u201ca large, modern family home where the family could live separately from guest accommodation and other more public areas of the house\u201d. The proposed flat would have occupied 1,418 sq m (15,260 sq ft) \u2013 making it more than 15 times the size of the average UK home. Luxury property experts said that if the plan does get the go-ahead, it could be worth \u00a3200m and would eclipse the current record-setting \u00a3135m triplex apartment in the One Hyde Park development down the street. Westminster\u2019s planning director noted that Tabor has lived in the borough for a decade and employed about 500 people at Global, his entertainment company, which owns Capital FM, Heart and LBC radio stations. The official said that \u201cin planning terms, they cannot be considered reasons that would overcome the strong presumption in policy to protect residential accommodation in Westminster and optimise the delivery of housing in London as a whole\u201d. Tabor is the son of gambling tycoon Michael Tabor, whose wealth is estimated at \u00a3625m. He is credited with helping discover acts including The Wanted and Corinne Bailey Rae, and is known for throwing popular parties at his Barbados mansion, Sunset Reef. Henry Pryor, a luxury property buying agent, said it was very unlikely that Westminster councillors would overrule the planning director\u2019s advice when they meet to vote on the plans next week. \u201cThe political environment has changed and everyone is against knocking two homes into one. Almost everyone thinks we should be increasing housing stock, not decreasing it.\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps refreshing to find that money can\u2019t buy you everything.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Japan\u2019s third-biggest steelmaker, Kobe Steel, is embroiled in a deepening scandal over the quality of products including aluminium and copper used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defence equipment. On Wednesday, the company said it had found one case of falsified data on iron ore powder \u2013 mainly used in vehicle parts such as gears \u2013 that had been shipped to a customer. It follows Kobe\u2019s admission at the weekend that it had falsified figures about the strength and durability of its aluminium and copper products, which are used in the transport and defence industries. Kobe\u2019s shares plummeted 18% after the iron ore admission, which brought the company\u2019s stock-market losses since the scandal broke to $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn). It is examining other possible data manipulations going back a decade. Toyota, one of its customers, described it as a \u201cgrave issue\u201d. Kobe\u2019s customers \u2013 the firm said more than 200 were affected \u2013 are rushing to check the safety of their products. The company supplies materials to carmakers Ford, Toyota, Honda, Mazda and Subaru as well as aircraft-makers Boeing and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Hitachi said trains exported to the UK were affected, but the trains had not started operating yet. Toyota, Nissan and Honda have all confirmed that they have used aluminium supplied by Kobe in hoods and doors. Toyota said it was \u201crapidly working to identify if any of our vehicle models may potentially be affected, and via which components. It added: \u201cAt the same time, we are considering what measures need to be put in place going forward to address this matter. Toyota has long requested its suppliers to be thorough in matters related to compliance. We recognise that this breach of compliance principles on the part of a supplier is a grave issue.\u201d Nissan said: \u201cWe have confirmed that aluminium from Kobe Steel is used in the hoods and doors of some of our vehicles. As hoods are related to pedestrian safety, we are working to quickly assess any potential impact on vehicle functionality.\u201d Kobe has also begun an investigation into Kobelco Research Institute, which tests products for the company, and found 70 cases of tampered data on materials used in optical disks and liquid crystal displays. \u201cData in inspection certificates had been improperly rewritten ... and the products were shipped as having met the specifications concerned,\u201d the company said, describing the actions as \u201cimproper conduct\u201d. Kobe, one of Japan\u2019s oldest industrial companies, said it was contacting its customers and working to establish whether the products it had supplied were safe. At the moment, it does not believe that safety has been compromised. \u201cVerification and inspection to date have not recognised specific problems casting doubts on the safety of the nonconforming products,\u201d it said. The company has set up a committee headed by its president, Hiroya Kawasaki, to investigate the quality issues, and hired a law firm to conduct an external investigation of all its businesses, including overseas. It discovered the misconduct during internal inspections and \u201cemergency quality audits\u201d. Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a senior official at Kobe, told a news conference: \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out the possibility that the external investigation will find other cases.\u201d He added that customers had not raised any safety issues or stopped buying the company\u2019s products. The Central Japan Railway Company said some parts it received from Kobe for its bullet trains did not meet Japanese industrial standards, but there were no safety issues. Kobe is under pressure from the Japanese government to resolve the crisis quickly. \u201cWe ask Kobe Steel to thoroughly look into the causes ... and take steps to prevent a recurrence as well as to make utmost efforts to restore the trust of not only its customers, but of society as a whole,\u201d said the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Kotaro Nogami.\u201c",

      "bodyText": "The latest world economic outlook by the IMF sees slightly better times ahead for the world economy than it did six months ago and slightly poorer times ahead for Australia. But the IMF has noted the crisis of low wage growth across all advanced economies \u2013 and recommends that in an era of highly flexible employment with increasing levels of part-time work, governments need to protect and extend minimum wages and also look at changing unemployment benefits to acknowledge that the era of full-time work being standard is in the past. As ever, the title of the IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook gives a good sense of the vibe. While never likely to be accused of clickbait, the titles generally provide a neat summation of the IMF\u2019s view. The two IMF outlooks in 2016 were titled Too slow for too long and Subdued demand, conveying the sense that has infected the world\u2019s economy since the GFC \u2013 things are positive, but barely so. By April this year the IMF was giving off small signs of optimism. The title of its outlook was Gaining momentum?, the question mark indicating a less than overwhelming sense of surety that things were getting better. The latest outlook, Seeking sustainable growth: short-term recovery, long-term challenges certainly steers clear of suggesting boom times ahead, but the IMF is at least gaining some confidence that we are perhaps nearing the end of the post-GFC malaise. The IMF has, for example, revised up its predictions for world growth in 2018 from 3.6% to 3.7%, with a big upward revision for the Euro area as well. It also sees China having a better 2018 than it previously thought. While there is no return to the very optimistic projections for the 8.5% growth it made back in 2013, the 6.5% growth for China in 2018 is 0.3percentage points above what it estimated in April. For Australia, the picture remains very much the same. Since 2014 the IMF has been predicting our economy in 2018 would grow by around 3%, and while there has been a slight revision down to 2.9%, essentially there is little change in the outlook. But of course the IMF (like most economic institutions) has a knack for getting its predictions wrong. In April it was predicting that Australia\u2019s economy would grow this year by 3.1%; now it expects that growth to be just 2.2%. That is a pretty sad prediction given the first six months of the year saw our economy grow by 1.2%. It means the IMF expects the economy to slow such that it will grow by a mere 1% in the second half of this year. The IMF also is slightly less optimistic than it was in April about our unemployment rate. In April it was predicting unemployment by the end of the year would fall to 5.3%, now it has it staying at the current level of 5.6%. It also expected by the end of next year the rate would be down to 5.1%, whereas now it has it at 5.4% before eventually going below 5% in 2020. That is actually a better outcome than the government is predicting. In the May budget, the best the Treasury foresaw was unemployment falling to 5.25% in 2020-21. Were our unemployment to fall to below 5% there might be some improvement in what the IMF has recognised is a major problem across all advanced economies \u2013 low wages growth. One chapter of the outlook was devoted to the issue, with the IMF noting that \u201cwage growth in most advanced economies remains markedly lower than it was before the great recession of 2008\u201309\u201d. This would be no surprise to Australian workers, but perhaps there is at least some comfort in knowing we\u2019re not alone. The IMF suggests a main cause of the weak wages growth is higher unemployment and underemployment coupled with lower inflation expectations and productivity growth. It notes that \u201clabour market developments in advanced economies point to a possible disconnect between unemployment and wages\u201d. This is something that has certainly been the case in Australia. The report noted that while many advanced economies have unemployment rates near where they were before the great recession, \u201cnominal wage growth rates continue to grow at a distinctly slower pace\u201d. This breakdown between unemployment and wage growth is clearly at play in Australia. Whereas normally wages grow faster as the unemployment rate falls, in the past two years, as the unemployment rate has fallen from 6.2%, wages growth has also fallen. The IMF notes in most advanced economies the average hours worked has fallen since the GFC, but that this fall is really just part of a long-term pattern, as is the case in Australia. The IMF comes across a bit flummoxed. It is almost as though it is shocked at the result of 30 years of pushing for lower wages growth, greater \u201cflexibility\u201d and lower union concentration. It notes that while greater flexibility has led to higher rates of involuntary part-time employment (where hours have been cut rather than the worker sacked) and that this has \u201chelped labour force participation and continued engagement with the workplace\u201d, the IMF says this also \u201cappears to be weighing on wage growth\u201d. Giving employers more power has led to lower wage growth? Who could have seen that coming? As a result the IMF reaches for some rather radical (for the usually conservative body) solutions. Other than greater productivity growth (always the IMF\u2019s go-to solution) it recommends governments take a much greater role in industrial relations. It recommends countries extend the minimum wage if part-time employees are not covered (not an issue here) and \u201coffering prorated paid annual, family, and sick leave to secure parity with full-time workers\u201d. Such a recommendation certainly sets the recent decision by the Fair Work Commission to cut penalty rates in awards covering the hospitality and retail sectors as a rather backward step. In an era where governments are struggling to work out how to increase wages growth, the biggest recent policy shift in our IR system has been to cut wages. Even more radically \u2013 if rather undefined \u2013 the IMF also argues for a major upheaval of the social security system. It suggests most nations\u2019 unemployment benefits are more geared towards economies that existed after the second world war \u2013 where you either worked full-time or you were unemployed. The report suggests \u201ca broader rethinking of the nature of social insurance may be needed\u201d. The IMF is not yet arguing for a universal basic income, but it clearly sees governments needing to play a more active role to ensure household incomes and standards of living can once again improve.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund says policy-makers have a window of opportunity to strengthen the global financial system before serious vulnerabilities emerge. It has singled out Australia for its high debt levels, saying household leverage and high house prices have made it more susceptible to interest rate shocks. The IMF\u2019s latest Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR), released overnight, has given a generally positive assessment. It says since its last GFSR in April, the financial system has continued to strengthen in response to extraordinary policy support, important regulatory enhancements, and the cyclical upturn in growth. It says investor risk appetite is buoyant globally, funding conditions have continued to improve, and global capital flows have surged. But it also warned that now was the time to be vigilant about emerging pressures. Tobias Adrian, the IMF\u2019s financial counsellor, said vulnerabilities were rising in the non-bank financial system, and policy-makers ought to seize the opportunity to strengthen the system. \u201cExperience has taught us that it is during times of easy financial conditions that vulnerabilities build,\u201d Adrian said. The report notes that as the global banking system continues to strengthen, financial stability risks are shifting toward non-bank and market sectors of the financial system. It says unconventional monetary policies and quantitative easing have forced substantial portfolio adjustments in the private sector and across borders, making the adjustment of financial markets \u201cmuch less predictable\u201d than in previous cycles. \u201cThere is too much money chasing too few yielding assets: less than 5% (US$1.8tn) of the current stock of global investment-grade fixed-income assets yields over 4%, compared with 80% (US$15.8tn) before the crisis,\u201d the report warns. Australia is singled out for its high debt levels. \u201cHousehold leverage and high house prices in Australia and Canada make these economies more susceptible to risk premium shocks,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn economies where debt service ratios for the private non-financial sectors have risen to high levels - such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and Korea - there is a particularly strong need for financial sector policy vigilance to guard against any further build-up of imbalances.\u201d The report notes the Reserve Bank of Australia has warned against the financial stability risks of high household debt and high debt-to-income ratios when inflation and wage growth are low. On Wednesday the IMF released its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), which dedicated an entire chapter to the impact of weather shocks and climate change on global economic activity. The WEO said the world\u2019s richest nations needed to have a greater sense of urgency about climate change, warning that coping with climate change would be one of the \u201cfundamental challenges\u201d of the 21st century. It also called on the global community to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions before they create \u201cmore irreversible damage\u201d, saying richer countries must help low-income economies adapt to rapidly increasing temperatures. The financial stability report mentioned climate change once, saying most IMF directors believed it was important to mitigate and adapt to climate change.",

      "bodyText": "Spain ended as the standout performer among European markets, despite the uncertainty over the standoff between Madrid and the Catalan independence seekers. At the very least, the demand for clarification over the independence situation meant the immediate tensions have been defused. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The stalemate between the region and the Spanish government is still ongoing, but the news that the region isn\u2019t rushing for the exit has lifted investor confidence. We don\u2019t have any clarity as to how the situation will develop from here, but at least the market can be confident of political stability in the country. Dealers may become nervous again when the separatists try and pursue their agenda, but at the moment normality has returned to the Spanish market. Overall in Europe, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.06% or 4.46 points at 7533.81, but it is still just 14 points or so below its closing peak Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.17% to 12,970.68 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.02% at 5362.41 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.97% to 22,552.21 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.34% at 10,278.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.85% to 748.61 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 21 points or 0.09%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Despite the rally in Japanese and Spanish stock markets, it has been fairly lacklustre elsewhere. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: It hasn\u2019t been the busiest day in global markets, despite further developments in the Spain/Catalonia situation. A lack of heavy data and earnings has characterised the week thus far, although with US banks on the calendar for the next two days that is about to change. Weakness throughout the morning was replaced by small gains, as the Spanish response to the Catalan (sort of) declaration of independence came in the form of a gentle, \u2018could you possibly clarify that?\u2019 from prime minister Rajoy. Catalonia now apparently exists in a state of limbo, having declared and then suspended its independence, while Spain has said it might think about activating Article 155. The irresistible force has met the immovable object, and stalemate has resulted. The lack of any drama has meant that, outside the Ibex, the market reaction has been limited. Back with the rise in the Japanese stock market, and this may not be the end of it, according to Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management. He says: Japan\u2019s stock market has hit a two decade high but we think it has further to run. The economy is picking up, corporate profits are being upgraded and the central bank is on the side of equity holders - unusually they have pledged to overshoot their inflation target of 2% and are keeping policy very loose until they get there. This policy commitment makes Japan\u2019s stock market a useful hedge against possible losses on bond portfolios if US interest rates continue to rise as we expect. Japanese long term rates are pinned down close to zero. Whenever US bonds sell off, widening interest rate differentials weaken the yen and boost the export-oriented Nikkei. It is for this reason that I have been overweight Japanese equities in multi asset funds but underweight the yen since this element of Abenomics was first announced. We don\u2019t expect the snap election to change things for the worse. If anything, an opposition win could result in the abandonment of planned sales tax rises, resulting in even looser fiscal policy. Global central banks have begun to start switching off the money taps which have been supporting the world economy and stock markets since the financial crisis. The US Federal Reserve has already begun raising interest rates, with another increase possible before the year end. The Bank of England is hinting at a rise in November despite an uninspiring UK economic performance, and the European Central Bank is looking at tapering its bond buying programme. So could these moves disrupt the global recovery? Capital Economics\u2019 Vicky Redwood says perhaps not: We expect global growth to slow only modestly as the era of easy money starts drawing to a close. The monetary tightening is set to be gradual, limited and staggered, with some countries only starting to tighten as others are finishing. And the relationship between interest rates and GDP growth has generally been weak. But with debt still high, the world economy would struggle with a much bigger tightening. The backdrop to this tightening is a reassuring combination of faster economic growth and low inflation. The world economy was only hit hard before when rates were raised abruptly to dampen high inflation. And although reversing quantitative easing is an added complication this time, central banks have already taken key steps along the path of monetary tightening with little effect on the economy or the markets. What\u2019s more, the tightening should be gradual. It is unlikely to be closely synchronised \u2013 we expect a gap of over three years between the first rises in US and euro-zone interest rates. And it need not be that big; neutral interest rates have fallen and central bank balance sheets are unlikely to return to pre- crisis levels. We think that, at most, half of the post-crisis loosening in monetary policy will get reversed But there are risks: Even a gradual approach to tightening may prove to be too much if demand is more fragile, or markets more nervy, than we think. And if central banks need to back-track, they have limited ammunition with which to loosen policy again. The gradual approach also risks inflating asset bubbles further, storing up trouble for the future. There is also a risk that a slow tightening simply turns out to be infeasible if inflation takes off, leading policymakers to tighten policy more rapidly than they have signalled. With debt to income ratios still high, and saving ratios low, a sharp rise in interest rates would make us significantly more worried. Elsewhere Opec, the organisation of petroleum exporting countries, has forecast higher demand for its oil in 2018. In its monthly report it said the world would need 33.06m barrels a day of its crude next year, up 230,000 barrels from its previous forecast. It suggested that its agreement to curb output was helping to get rid of a supply glut. But it does not expect prices to surge, forecasting that crude will remain between $50 and $55 a barrel in the next year. Brent crude is currently down 0.11% at $56.55. Q: Is there a tax rate above which it would be counter-productive to tax the rich?* The IMF\u2019s Vitor Gaspar says the IMF hasn\u2019t come to any conclusions on this. But, since the 1970s, tax rates on the wealthy have fallen steadily, and the Fund believes there is scope to raise them without damaging growth, he reiterates. * - this question was most famously tackled by economist Arthur Laffer, on the back of a napkin, showing that raising taxes too high can actually result in lower revenues: It\u2019s very popular with economists and politicians who favour tax cuts - the problem, though, is knowing where you are on the curve in the first place.. Surely no-one can argue with this chart?.... The IMF\u2019s concerns about inequality might grate with readers in Greece, for example, where years of austerity have driven millions deeper into poverty. Nadia Daar, who runs Oxfam\u2019s office in Washington DC, hopes that today\u2019s warm words will actually translate into action: Vitor Gaspar, the IMF\u2019s Director of Fiscal Affairs, is taking questions now. He says improving heathcare provisions for the poor would help tackle inequality. Asked about the IMF\u2019s comments on taxation, Gaspar says that back in 1981 the average top marginal rate was 62%. That has fallen to 35% now. He says the Fund is \u201cagnostic\u201d about whether countries will want to tax their higher earners more. But it also believes that countries should put inclusive growth at the top of their agenda. The IMF is concerned that inequality has risen in more than half the world\u2019s countries in the last three decades. That includes three major nations - China, India and the United States. - even though inequality has declined across the globe. These rises in inequality can hurt \u201csocial cohesion\u201d, lead to political polarization, and ultimately lower economic growth, the Fund warns. Some countries have experienced a reduction in inequality while others, particularly advanced economies, have seen a significant increase that has, among other things, contributed to growing public backlash against globalization. The IMF are presenting the details of their Fiscal Monitor in Washington now - it\u2019s being streamed live here. NEWSFLASH: The International Monetary Fund is calling on governments to consider tackle inequality by raising taxes on the rich. In its latest Fiscal Monitor report, just released, the Fund argues that taxing top earners more would not have an adverse impact on growth. Indeed, it says \u201cprogressive taxation\u201d and fiscal transfers can be key components of a strategy to redistribute wealth more fairly. These conclusions appear to support centre-left parties who push for higher taxes on the wealthiest, but are a rebuke to the right-wing argument that cutting taxes for top earners will trickle-down through the income layers. From Washington, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: In an analysis certain to be seized on by Labour as backing for its tax strategy, the IMF used its influential half-yearly fiscal monitor to attack the rationale for the reductions in tax for the highest earners in recent decades. The IMF said tax theory suggested there should be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d tax rates for those on higher incomes but the argument against doing so was that hitting the rich would be bad for growth. \u201cEmpirical results do not support this argument, at least for levels of progressivity that are not excessive,\u201d the IMF said, adding that different types of wealth taxes might also be considered. The fiscal monitor does not mention any country by name, but the thrust of the report suggests it has doubts about the pro-rich tax plan proposed by Donald Trump for the US. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full story: David Lipton, the IMF\u2019s deputy managing director, sums up the challenge facing politicians and central bank chiefs -- tackle risks, while avoiding a crash. The International Monetary Fund has sounded a new warning that the good times in the global economy may not last. In its new Global Financial Stability Report, the Fund points its finger at the rising debt piles across advanced and emerging economies. It fears that the increased risk appetite and the ongoing search for yield means investors could be too reckless, with dangerous consequences. Tobias Adrian, of the IMF\u2019s financial stability watchdog, warns this complacency could be creating financial excesses. \u201cWhile the waters seem calm, vulnerabilities are building under the surface [and] if left unattended, these could derail the global recovery. The IMF singled out Australia, Canada and China as being three countries where households and businesses have taken on more debt, potentially putting them at risk if there is a new financial crisis. Over in Westminster, the Unite trade union have held a protest urging the government to do more to protect Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. Those jobs are threatened by the 220% tariff which the US government is imposing on Bombardier planes sold to Delta Airlines, following a complaint by Boeing that its Canadian rival was getting unfair subsidies. Several MPs took part in the demonstration too (Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey is in the middle, in front of shadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner). The preliminary decision to impose tariffs on Bombardier\u2019s C-Series jets has been widely criticised (Boeing faces particular stick, as it doesn\u2019t manufacture a similar jet anyway). Gardiner gave Boeing a rollicking on Bloomberg TV this morning, calling the US planemaker a \u2018subsidy junkie\u2019 and the \u2018king of corporate welfare\u2019. The government has also criticised Boeing, saying it doesn\u2019t like to see such behaviour from a partner. Maybe that\u2019s why the US company has put up some adverts for MPs to admire on the way to and from parliament. CNBC\u2019s Michael Santoli suggests Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t demand too much credit for the US stock market rally. After all, shares rallied just as strongly in the 11 months after Barack Obama was re-elected to the White House in 2012. Obama\u2019s first term didn\u2019t begin with much of a rally, though, as the markets were still tumbling as the world economy entered recession. US president Donald Trump is unhappy that the media aren\u2019t giving more coverage to the stock market rally (maybe he\u2019s not reading the right liveblogs.....) He\u2019s tweeted that the US stock market has gained over $5 trillion since he won last November\u2019s election: It\u2019s true that the Trump Rally (if we must call it that) is impressive, with the Dow Jones industrial average up around 25% in the last 11 months. But I\u2019m not sure that this proves the need for tax cuts (which, experts point out, will mainly benefit the very richest in America). Actually, the rally is partly due to predictions that Trump will make it easier for firms to repatriate funds that are currently parked overseas. That money might then be handed to shareholders in dividends, or used to buy back shares. Not very good for growth, but a boost for share prices.... Sam Jones, our correspondent in Barcelona, says Mariano Rajoy has just put the ball back in Catalonia\u2019s side of the court in the independence crisis. He writes: Rajoy, who has refused to rule out invoking article 155 of the Spanish constitution to take control of Catalonia, was quick to seize on the ambiguity of [Catalan president] Puigdemont\u2019s position, accusing him of deliberately sowing confusion. \u201cThe cabinet has agreed this morning to formally require the Catalan government to confirm whether it has declared independence after the deliberate confusion created over whether it has come into effect,\u201d he said in a television address on Wednesday. Here\u2019s the full story: Back in Madrid, prime minister Mariano Rajoy has demanded full clarity over the Catalonian president\u2019s announcement yesterday that he has \u2018suspended independence\u2019. Rajoy says he needs to know whether the region has formerly declared a breakaway, and hinted that the region could lose its existing powers if it has. Assocated Press has the details: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy demanded on Wednesday that the Catalan leader clarify whether he has declared independence, issuing a veiled threat that the central government could limit or rescind the province\u2019s autonomy if he has. He said the Catalan government\u2019s response would be crucial in deciding \u201cevents over the coming days.\u201d It is the first time that Rajoy has openly said that Article 155 of the Spanish constitution will be the next step taken by the government if Catalan authorities don\u2019t backtrack. He said the government \u201cwants to offer certainty to citizens\u201d and that it is \u201cnecessary to return tranquility and calm.\u201d Spain\u2019s stock market is now pushing higher, sending the IBEX up 1.5% today to 10,299 points. That keeps world stocks at this morning\u2019s record high. Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder and chairman of Cobra Beer, is worried about a \u201cno deal\u201d outcome from Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiations. This option re-emerged from the fog of Brexit yesterday, when prime minister Theresa May told MPs that it was possible that Britain might not reach an agreement with Brussels over its future arrangement. Bilimoria says it would be a \u201cterrible\u201d blow to companies such as Cobra (a favourite tipple at many Indian restaurants) and the wider UK economy. \u201cNo deal would be the worst possible outcome and when the public voted to leave they didn\u2019t give the government a blank cheque to leave on any basis whatsoever. \u201cIn practical terms it would be very difficult because we export Cobra from Burton on Trent to almost every country in Europe. We manufacture two of our products in Belgium, and import from Belgium into the UK. At the moment it\u2019s seamless. If we suddenly have to deal with border controls and checks and the extra cost of import costs both ways, that makes our product less competitive. It\u2019s going to be terrible. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Bilimoria said the sharp fall in the value of the pound - which makes British goods cheaper abroad - since the Brexit vote was not entirely helpful either. \u201cThe currency effect helps our exports on the one hand but we as a country are a net importer so the consumer is starting to take a hit. We supply 98.5% of the Indian restaurants in this country. They are taking a hit because a lot of their ingredients are imported so for our export business, yes it helps, but as a country we\u2019re net importers. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a British manufacturer but we\u2019re reliant on inward investment. Britain is the largest recipient of inward investment in the whole of Europe and our position at the top table of the world is already hugely diminished already, let alone leaving the European Union.\u201d Chancellor Philip Hammond has been discussing Brexit in front of the Treasury committee this morning. Hammond warned that a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit could leave the EU and the UK unable to share data, and could even mean airlines can\u2019t fly between the two (although he added that this is an unlikely outcome). The chancellor also floated the risk of a \u201cbad-tempered\u201d Brexit, if the two sides don\u2019t make progress on Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. But he is also resisting pressure to commit billions in extra spending on new customs controls at the UK borders, until we have more clarity over the future. Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has full details: The Nikkei\u2019s rise to a 21-year high today has stirred some memories for Nick Leeson, the original Rogue Trader. Leeson swapped a desk at Barings Bank for a cell at Changi Prison after running up a series of losses which he hid from his bosses. The black hole which brought down Barings in 1995 emerged after Leeson wagered that the Nikkei would remain stable on a particular day (by selling put and call options that would deliver a profit if the market stayed calm, but cost him if it rose or fell by much). Unfortunately for Leeson, the Kobe earthquake struck - sending the Nikkei tumbling. He placed a series of increasingly unlikely bets that it would recover, before being uncovered. Leeson\u2019s tongue-in-cheek point is that those positions would have turned a profit, eventually. But the scale of his losses actually wiped out Barings capital reserves, ensuring its demise. Here\u2019s how we reported it at the time: The BBC\u2019s Katya Adler has the latest from Spain.... Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, agrees that Catalonia\u2019s decision to back away from declaring full-blown independence last night has reassured the markets. He says: European markets are looking towards Spain for inspiration, as the decision from Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont to delay a declaration of independence has led to a sharp rise in the IBEX and euro. But... the situation does remain fluid. Spain\u2019s cabinet will meet later today to discuss the situation, and prime minister Mariano Rajoy is due to speak about the issue soon. Boom! World stock markets have hit a new all time high. MSCI\u2019s All-World stocks index, which tracks 2,400 companies around the globe, has inched up to 493.31 points this morning. That\u2019s partly due to the Nikkei\u2019s surge to a two-decade closing high in Japan today. The rally in Spanish stocks and bonds this morning is also helping. David Meier, economist at Julius Baer, says the news that Catalonia plans to negotiate with Madrid, rather than immediately trigger independence, is reassuring investors. He writes: \u201cThis episode could serve as a deterrent for other independence movements in Spain and Europe rather than lead to a rise in break-up risks. Markets rightly maintain their calm. The global market rally also owes a lot to US stocks, which have racked up a string of record highs this year. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained more than 20% since Donald Trump won the US election last November, even though his promises of tax reform and infrastructure spending are still on the \u2018To Do\u2019 list. Relief over Catalonia has also pushed the euro to a two week high, at $1.184 against the US dollar. Spanish bonds are also recovering. Spain\u2019s stock market has opened strongly, on relief that Catalonia\u2019s president has backed away from declaring independence. The IBEX jumping over 1% in early trading, with traders welcoming President Carles Puigdemont speech last night in which he pledged to negotiate with Spanish government, and \u201csuspend\u201d the independence move Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says investors are hoping that the two sides can hammer out a compromise: A strong sense of relief was felt across financial markets on Tuesday evening, after Catalan leaders signed a \u201csymbolic\u201d declaration of independence, but immediately suspended its formal approval and called for talks with Madrid. Although President Carles Puigdemont\u2019s remarks disappointed many of his ardent supporters, who were hoping for a unilateral declaration of independence, his speech was music to investors\u2019 ears, as this softer approach eased tensions. The Nikkei\u2019s rally comes despite a big scandal enveloping Japan\u2019s third-biggest steel maker, Kobe Steel. Kobe has shocked Japan, and beyond, by admitting that it has fabricated data on components used in cars, aircraft and space rockets. The company has sold aluminium and copper products to more than 200 companies, including Boeing, Toyota and Nissan, even though they had failed quality control tests - and falsified data to make it appear that items had passed. The scandal may stretch back a decade, Kobe says, and involved dozens of staff. It risks damaging Japan\u2019s reputation for manufacturing quality. Today, the company revealed that iron powder results were also faked. Kobe\u2019s share price has now plunged by a third since the company came clean on Sunday, and top officials bowed apologetically to reporters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Japan\u2019s stock index has closed at its highest level in over two decades, as optimism over the global economy builds and geopolitical worries ease. Upbeat traders in Tokyo sent the Nikkei 225 index up to 20,881.27, a gain of 57 points or almost 0.3%. It comes after Wall Street\u2019s Dow Jones index hit a fresh record high last night, as the bull market rally refuses to fizzle out. There was excitement in Tokyo as trading ended.... The Nikkei, which tracks Japan\u2019s manor companies, is now at levels last seen in December 1996. It\u2019s a strong recovery from the depths of the financial crisis (in 2009, the Nikkei suffered an undignified tumble below 8,000 points). Is this proof that you should invest in the stock market for the long term? Not exactly. The Nikkei\u2019s alltime peak was actually a stratospheric 38,915.87 points, back in December 1989. Someone who bought Japanese shares 30 years ago may still be waiting patiently to break even... But still, it\u2019s a nice landmark, and comes after the International Monetary Fund raised its forecasts for global growth yesterday. Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, say\u2019s there\u2019s a \u201crisk on\u201d mood in the markets again: \u201cOne of the biggest drivers of global equities is the United States and some of the macro data coming out from there has been quite positive. There is also this view that China is travelling much better than many people had expected.\u201d There\u2019s also relief that tensions between the US and North Korea haven\u2019t become further inflamed, and that Catalonia has suspended its declaration of independence. This all helped other Asia-Pacific markets to rally today too. New Zealand shares hit their record high for a seventh day running, while Australia\u2019s market hit an eight-week high. European stock markets are expected to follow suit this morning: Also coming up today.... 2pm BST: The International Monetary Fund release its Global Financial Stability Report this afternoon. It will single out dangers to the global economy, and identify solutions to avoid a new financial crisis. 7pm BST: The US Federal Reserve releases the minutes of its monetary policy meeting earlier this month. Wall Street will be looking for hints about whether interest rates will rise in December.",

At the very least, the demand for clarification over the independence situation meant the immediate tensions have been defused. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The stalemate between the region and the Spanish government is still ongoing, but the news that the region isn\u2019t rushing for the exit has lifted investor confidence. We don\u2019t have any clarity as to how the situation will develop from here, but at least the market can be confident of political stability in the country. Dealers may become nervous again when the separatists try and pursue their agenda, but at the moment normality has returned to the Spanish market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall in Europe, the final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 0.06% or 4.46 points at 7533.81, but it is still just 14 points or so below its closing peak</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.17% to 12,970.68</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.02% at 5362.41</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.97% to 22,552.21</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.34% at 10,278.4</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.85% to 748.61</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 21 points or 0.09%.</p> <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day.

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It hasn\u2019t been the busiest day in global markets, despite further developments in the Spain/Catalonia situation. A lack of heavy data and earnings has characterised the week thus far, although with US banks on the calendar for the next two days that is about to change.</p> <p>Weakness throughout the morning was replaced by small gains, as the Spanish response to the Catalan (sort of) declaration of independence came in the form of a gentle, \u2018could you possibly clarify that?\u2019 from prime minister Rajoy.</p> <p>Catalonia now apparently exists in a state of limbo, having declared and then suspended its independence, while Spain has said it might think about activating Article 155. The irresistible force has met the immovable object, and stalemate has resulted. The lack of any drama has meant that, outside the Ibex, the market reaction has been limited.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59de3469e4b0d247a08b9be3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-11T15:12:31.939Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the rise in the Japanese stock market, and this may not be the end of it, according to Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Japan\u2019s stock market has hit a two decade high but we think it has further to run. The economy is picking up, corporate profits are being upgraded and the central bank is on the side of equity holders - unusually they have pledged to overshoot their inflation target of 2% and are keeping policy very loose until they get there.</p> <p>This policy commitment makes Japan\u2019s stock market a useful hedge against possible losses on bond portfolios if US interest rates continue to rise as we expect. Japanese long term rates are pinned down close to zero. Whenever US bonds sell off, widening interest rate differentials weaken the yen and boost the export-oriented Nikkei.</p> <p>It is for this reason that I have been overweight Japanese equities in multi asset funds but underweight the yen since this element of Abenomics was first announced. We don\u2019t expect the snap election to change things for the worse. If anything, an opposition win could result in the abandonment of planned sales tax rises, resulting in even looser fiscal policy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59de307fe4b014d93a1be128\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-11T15:01:17.161Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Global central banks have begun to start switching off the money taps which have been supporting the world economy and stock markets since the financial crisis.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve has already begun raising interest rates, with another increase possible before the year end. The Bank of England is hinting at a rise in November despite an uninspiring UK economic performance, and the European Central Bank is looking at tapering its bond buying programme.</p> <p>So could these moves disrupt the global recovery? Capital Economics\u2019 Vicky Redwood says perhaps not:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect global growth to slow only modestly as the era of easy money starts drawing to a close. The monetary tightening is set to be gradual, limited and staggered, with some countries only starting to tighten as others are finishing. And the relationship between interest rates and GDP growth has generally been weak. But with debt still high, the world economy would struggle with a much bigger tightening. </p> <p>The backdrop to this tightening is a reassuring combination of faster economic growth and low inflation. The world economy was only hit hard before when rates were raised abruptly to dampen high inflation. And although reversing quantitative easing is an added complication this time, central banks have already taken key steps along the path of monetary tightening with little effect on the economy or the markets. </p> <p>What\u2019s more, the tightening should be gradual. It is unlikely to be closely synchronised \u2013 we expect a gap of over three years between the first rises in US and euro-zone interest rates. And it need not be that big; neutral interest rates have fallen and central bank balance sheets are unlikely to return to pre- crisis levels. We think that, at most, half of the post-crisis loosening in monetary policy will get reversed</p> </blockquote> <p>But there are risks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even a gradual approach to tightening may prove to be too much if demand is more fragile, or markets more nervy, than we think. And if central banks need to back-track, they have limited ammunition with which to loosen policy again. The gradual approach also risks inflating asset bubbles further, storing up trouble for the future.</p> <p>There is also a risk that a slow tightening simply turns out to be infeasible if inflation takes off, leading policymakers to tighten policy more rapidly than they have signalled. With debt to income ratios still high, and saving ratios low, a sharp rise in interest rates would make us significantly more worried. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59de2b57e4b014d93a1be110\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-11T14:35:36.647Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Opec lifts oil demand forecast</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Elsewhere Opec, the organisation of petroleum exporting countries, has forecast higher demand for its oil in 2018.</p> <p>In its monthly report it said the world would need 33.06m barrels a day of its crude next year, up 230,000 barrels from its previous forecast.

The Labour MP Frank Field expressed concern over claims that private equity group Greybull Capital could avoid losing money while the carrier\u2019s pension fund \u2013 which is owed \u00a37.5m \u2013 could be among creditors left with nothing. Field, whose committee led an investigation into the collapse of BHS after its sale for \u00a31 to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell, has now written to the chief executive of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), Alan Rubenstein, questioning the status of the pension fund. He wants to know if the PPF, which rescues pension funds attached to failed companies, has received any payments yet from Monarch relating to the \u00a37.5m, and where the pension fund sits in the order of creditor preference. Responding to the report, Field said: \u201cHow can it be that, once again, mega-rich individuals could walk away from a collapsed company with a bumper profit while ordinary people pick up the bill? \u201cThis massively supports the case for the law to change, to robustly protect pension schemes.\u201d In response, Greybull said it hoped the PPF loan note would be paid back, if a sale of Monarch\u2019s assets was successful. In a statement, it said its original financing had been agreed by industry watchdog the Civil Aviation Authority and the PPF. \u201cGreybull has not taken out loan repayments, dividends or interest in the last three years,\u201d Greybull said. \u201cMonarch\u2019s demise cannot be reasonably attributed to the actions of Greybull. We have had a constructive relationship with the PPF since 2014 and aim to continue to do so. \u201cThe administrators are working to maximise the proceeds from the sale of assets. If the recovery on assets is as speculated on in the press, we expect the PPF loan note to be paid in full.\u201d Britain\u2019s longest-surviving airline brand was placed into administration earlier this month, leaving 110,000 customers abroad and 750,000 future bookings cancelled. Greybull, which bought a majority stake in the airline three years ago, was said to have lost \u00a3250m in the collapse after pumping that much into the business. It bought 90% of Monarch in 2014 for a token \u00a31, with the pension scheme owning the remaining 10%. But the Financial Times reported that Greybull\u2019s owners, the French brothers Marc and Nathaniel Meyohas, only put about \u00a385m in cash into the business, with other financing coming from elsewhere \u2013 including from US aircraft maker Boeing, and a dowry from the Swiss Mantegazza family, who sold the business. On top of that, the way that Greybull\u2019s secured loans to Monarch were structured means it has first call on the airline\u2019s assets, according to the report. These are said to include about \u00a330m of cash, takeoff and landing slots which could be worth \u00a360m, and an engineering business which is not in administration. Other creditors, including Monarch\u2019s pension scheme are likely to be left with nothing, the report said. As part of the Greybull takeover, the pension scheme \u2013 which had a deficit of about \u00a3158m at the time \u2013 was separated from the company. Pension regulators agreed to the move because they were satisfied Monarch would have gone bust within 12 months without the deal. Malcolm Weir, director of restructuring and insolvency at the PPF, said it was in the process of responding to Field\u2019s letter but added that, without the PPF\u2019s protection in 2014 when the airline was restructured, Monarch pension scheme members would have faced significant losses. He said: \u201cThe expected recovery for the pension scheme if Monarch had gone bust in November 2014 was \u00a30. \u201cThe \u00a330m in cash secured for the scheme by the restructuring of Monarch was much more than the scheme would have otherwise received. The restructuring met the PPF\u2019s published tests.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "IMF: higher taxes for rich will cut inequality without hitting growth", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Higher income tax rates for the rich would help reduce inequality without having an adverse impact on growth, the International Monetary Fund has said. The Washington-based IMF used its influential half-yearly fiscal monitor to demolish the argument that economic growth would suffer if governments in advanced Western countries forced the top 1% of earners to pay more tax. The IMF said tax theory suggested there should be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d tax rates for those on higher incomes but the argument against doing so was that hitting the rich would be bad for growth. But the influential global institution said: \u201cEmpirical results do not support this argument, at least for levels of progressivity that are not excessive.\u201d The IMF added that different types of wealth taxes might also be considered. Labour seized on the report, calling for higher taxes on the rich, citing the IMF\u2019s intervention as evidence of the need for a fairer tax system. In its election manifesto, Labour proposed a new 45% tax band on those earning more than \u00a380,000 and a 50% rate for those on more than \u00a3123,000. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe IMF support the argument we made in the General Election for a fairer tax system. There is no evidence to support those who scaremonger about the effects of making the rich pay fairer tax.\u201d He added: \u201c Not only have the Tories slashed the top rate of tax, they still plan billions in tax giveaways to the super rich and big corporations over this parliament.\u201d Despite claims from ministers that Labour\u2019s tax plans would be both politically and economically damaging, McDonnell believes higher taxes for the rich would be both workable and popular. \u201cWith every day that passes the case for a change of direction at the Treasury grows. Instead of engaging in infighting in his own party the chancellor should listen to Labour\u2019s calls for fairer taxes and increased investment, so we will build an economy for the many not the few.\u201d Theresa May has repeatedly attacked Labour\u2019s approach as extreme, claiming in prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday that Corbyn and McDonnell are on \u201cplanet Venezuela\u201d. But the prime minister conceded at a fringe meeting at her party\u2019s conference in Manchester that public opinion appears to be more favourable to some of Labour\u2019s economic ideas than Conservative strategists had assumed in the run-up to June\u2019s general election. \u201cWe thought there was a political consensus,\u201d she said. \u201cJeremy Corbyn changed that\u201d. With Philip Hammond due to deliver his budget next month, it is unclear whether the government will press ahead with promised tax cuts for higher earners, including plans to increase the higher rate threshold for income tax to \u00a350,000. The fiscal monitor does not mention any country by name and does not specify at what level governments should set the new higher rate for top earners. But the report stressed that cutting tax for the top 1% had gone too far - a strong hint that the IMF has doubts about the pro-rich tax plan proposed by Donald Trump for the US. Instead, the IMF said higher tax for the rich was necessary to arrest rising income inequality \u2013 the argument used by McDonnell and the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. The fiscal monitor said most advanced economies in the West had experienced a sizeable increase in income inequality in the past three decades, driven primarily by the growing income of the top 1%. Traditionally, governments have sought to make their societies less unequal by levying higher income tax rates on the rich and using the proceeds to help those less well off either directly or through public services. But it found that income tax systems had become markedly less progressive in the 1980s and 1990s and had remained stable since then, even though growing inequality raised the need for a more progressive approach. In an IMF blog, the head of the IMF\u2019s fiscal affairs unit, Vitor Gaspar, said the average top income tax rate for the rich country members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development had fallen from 62% in 1981 to 35% in 2015. \u201cIn addition, tax systems are less progressive than indicated by the statutory rates, because wealthy individuals have more access to tax relief,\u201d Gaspar said in the blog co-written with Mercedes Garcia-Escribano. \u201cImportantly, we find that some advanced economies can increase progressivity without hampering growth, as long as progressivity is not excessive.\u201d IMF research found that between 1985 and 1995, redistribution through the tax system had offset 60% of the increase in inequality caused by market forces. But between 1995 and 2010, income tax systems failed to respond to the continuing increase in inequality. It also said inequality should be tackled by giving a more pro-poor slant to public spending. \u201cDespite progress, gaps in access to quality education and healthcare services between different income groups in the population remain in many countries,\u201d Gaspar and Garcia-Escribano said, adding that in rich countries men with university education lived up to 14 years longer than those with secondary education or less. \u201cBetter public spending can help, for instance, by reallocating education or health spending from the rich to the poor while keeping total public education or health spending unchanged,\u201d they added. In its separate global financial stability review, the IMF said it would take several years for central banks to return interest rates to more normal levels due to the risk of aborting recovery. But the report also highlighted the risk that prolonged monetary support could lead to the buildup of further financial excesses. Too much money was chasing too few assets offering a yield, the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cA fair tax system is a critical part of our plan to build a fairer society. Today, the richest 1% pay over a quarter of all income tax while 4 million of the lower earners have been taken out of income tax altogether.\u201d",

The move is an interim step towards Theresa May\u2019s promise to put a ceiling on bills based on standard variable tariffs, the poor-value rates that about two-thirds of consumers are on. Business secretary Greg Clark criticised the new cap for not going far or fast enough. Ofgem said the extra 1m households would save \u00a3120 on average on their annual dual fuel bill once the so-called safeguard tariff took effect by February. \u201cThis will provide some short-term relief for vulnerable customers ahead of government plans for an energy price cap being realised,\u201d it said. The cap will protect households that are in receipt of the warm home discount, an existing payment for people on certain benefits. Ofgem said the cap would be extended to a further 2 million people in winter 2018-19. Dermot Nolan, the chief executive of the energy regulator, said: \u201cOfgem shares the government\u2019s concern that the energy market is not working for all consumers and is determined to reduce the detriment suffered by those overpaying for their energy, particularly those who are vulnerable.\u201d Greg Clark welcomed the regulator\u2019s move but said stronger action was needed. \u201cI don\u2019t think it goes far enough and fast enough. I think it\u2019s important that consumers who are overpaying should be given some relief from that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I will proceed and bring forward legislation later this week that will compel them to do that.\u201d A new analysis, released by the Big Deal collective switching site, shows that customers on standard deals with the big six energy providers can pay as much as \u00a3225 more than their cheapest deal. It says that 8m households have been on a standard variable tariff with the big six \u2013 EDF Energy, British Gas, SSE, E.ON, Scottish Power and npower \u2013 for more than three years, the report said. The difference between standard variable tariffs and the cheapest available deals at the big six ranges from \u00a355 at SSE, to \u00a3225 at E.ON, the Big Deal said. Consumer groups said the latest move by Ofgem was a step in the right direction before a wider price cap is introduced by the government. \u201cThe implementation of a market-wide price cap is clearly going to take some time, so it\u2019s right that the regulator is looking to more quickly protect the most vulnerable,\u201d said Alex Neill, the Which? managing director of home products and services. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the move by Ofgem was \u201ca warning to energy firms that they can no longer get away with ripping off their poorest customers\u201d. On Thursday, the government is due to publish a draft energy bill for the cap on standard variable tariffs, which is unlikely to take effect until next winter at the earliest. Nolan said that Ofgem \u201cstands ready\u201d to put in place a broader price cap once royal assent has been given to any bill passed by parliament. \u201cWe are in a position to go forward fairly quickly after royal assent is given. My guess is that all going well, it could be five months [after royal assent]. Possibly it could be more, possibly it could be less.\u201d John Penrose, the Conservative MP who led calls in his party for a cap before the Tory party conference, said the government should look at introducing the wider cap in time for this winter, rather than next winter. \u201cSeventeen million households shouldn\u2019t have to wait up to two years for the cavalry to arrive,\u201d Penrose said. \u2018We need faster routes to deliver our pledge. We should look at using secondary legislation to get this through parliament quickly and end the rip-off before the cold winter months start to bite.\u201d Labour also urged the government to act immediately. \u201cThe government needs to hurry up and get on with it if customers are to feel the benefit this winter,\u201d said Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary. \u201cIt is now mid-October and we are yet to have sight of the legislation, despite Labour\u2019s persistent calls for the government to take action.\u201d Nolan said it was not for Ofgem to comment on exactly what form a wider price cap might take. \u201cWe will have to see what parliament comes up with and we will consult on that basis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could lead to a number of options. I support any decision of parliament and we will implement it as effectively as possible.\u201d Nolan said that in the meantime he expected energy firms to do their best to move customers off standard variable tariffs while the legislation worked its way through parliament. To that end, Ofgem is changing rules that previously meant suppliers had to move customers on to standard variable tariffs at the end of a fixed tariff. Now they will be able to automatically roll them on to another fixed deal, provided it is cheaper. Scottish Power and E.ON have said recently that they are taking steps to end the standard variable tariffs, switching billpayers to cheaper, fixed-term deals instead. Nolan said he hoped others would follow, as long as it resulted in consumers being placed on better tariffs. \u201cI\u2019m calling on all suppliers to do more to get people off SVTs,\u201d he added. \u201cThe ball is very strongly in their court and I would hope to see action from all suppliers.\u201d Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, said Ofgem\u2019s move to protect more vulnerable consumers was a step in the right direction. \u201cWe now await details of the government\u2019s draft bill and remain committed to acting to improve the functioning of the market for our customers,\u201d Centrica added.",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s plan to return the budget to surplus is heavily reliant on personal tax increases across every income bracket but hitting middle-income earners hardest, the Parliamentary Budget Office has revealed. Middle income earners (with an average taxable income of $46,000) will experience the highest average tax increases of any income quintile, jumping 3.2 percentage points, from 14.9% to 18.2% over the next five years. The PBO\u2019s paper, released on Wednesday, reveals for the first time how the Turnbull government\u2019s projected budget surplus in 2020-21 is relying on specific increases in average personal income tax rates. The tax hikes reflect a seismic shift in the taxation burden from businesses to individuals. The personal tax increases are necessary to compensate for the government\u2019s controversial $65.4bn company tax cut. According to the PBO, the average tax rate on individual Australians is estimated to increase by 2.3 percentage points between 2017-18 and 2021-22. But there are large differences between income quintiles. Taxpayers in the first income quintile (the lowest 20% of income earners) will see their average tax rate increase by 0.2 percentage points over the next five years. Taxpayers in the second income quintile will see their average tax rate increase by 2.5 percentage points. Taxpayers in the fourth quintile will see their average tax rate increase by 2.3 percentage points. Taxpayers in the fifth quintile (the highest 20% of income earners) will see their average tax rate increase by 1.9 percentage points. The PBO report shows the Turnbull government is relying heavily on \u201cbracket creep\u201d to bring the budget back to surplus. Bracket creep is the phenomenon whereby taxpayers shift into higher tax brackets when their nominal incomes grow, due to inflation and/or real wages growth. The PBO says the government\u2019s projected budget surplus is relying heavily on more than 1 million Australians shifting into higher tax brackets over the next five years, where their average tax rates will increase. Projections show over 900,000 taxpayers will move from a marginal tax rate of 32.5% to 37% between 2017-18 and 2021-22. Similarly, 700,00 people are projected to move from a marginal tax rate of 19% to 32.5% over the same period. \u201cIn addition to the effect of nominal income growth, average tax rates are projected to increase due to policy changes, most notably the policy decision to increase the Medicare levy from 2019-20,\u201d the PBO report says. Two weeks ago award-reliant workers in the fast food, hospitality, retail and pharmacy sectors lost millions of dollars in income collectively after their public holiday penalty rates were cut in Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT and South Australia. According to the McKell Institute, a Labor-aligned thinktank, those workers may have collectively lost between $4.7m and $9.5m on the grand final weekend, depending on how many were rostered on. The PBO warned earlier this year that the Turnbull government\u2019s plan to return the budget to surplus on the back of rising personal income tax relied heavily on a sharp acceleration in wages growth over the decade. It warned the \u201csignificant slowdown\u201d in wages growth experienced in the past few years suggested this gamble by the government was subject to \u201cdownside risk\u201d.",
