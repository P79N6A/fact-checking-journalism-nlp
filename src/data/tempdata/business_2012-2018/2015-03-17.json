      "bodyText": "The problem with demergers, they say, is that the costs of separation \u2013 like tax bills and lawyers\u2019 and bankers\u2019 fees \u2013 are paid up-front whereas the claimed benefits tend to be ill-defined or prone to disappearing in the wash. BHP Billiton is partly guilty on this score. It is in the process of spinning off a collection of aluminium, coal, nickel, manganese, silver, lead and zinc assets under the oddball name of South32. The cost of the demerger is a mighty $641m (\u00a3435m) after tax plus $60m a year for South32 to set itself up for independent life. On the other side of ledger, apart from $100m of savings, the main purpose of the exercise is \u201cgreater focus\u201d, an ambition where gains are notoriously hard to measure. Does this make the great shuffle of mines a waste of time? Actually, no. This restructuring looks sensible. We grumble here regularly about companies that make themselves so large and complicated that they baffle even their own managements (think: the big banks, especially HSBC, and Serco etcetera), so BHP\u2019s search for simplicity should be applauded. Prospects for South32 \u2013 most of its assets are in Australia and South Africa, linked by the 32nd line of latitude \u2013 will not be transformed by the mere act of separation. But there is a fair argument that a newly-independent board will make cuter investment decisions. Boss-in-waiting Graham Kerr can\u2019t complain that his hands are being tied. BHP is shoving only $674m of debt on to South32. Kerr will have a company worth $14bn-ish, think the analysts, and the chance to increase its value, even if a bidder doesn\u2019t show up. BHP will still be colossal and remain the world\u2019s biggest miner, spanning iron ore, copper, coal and oil, with a sideline in potash. But instead of having 41 assets in 13 countries, it will soon have 19 in eight. That must be easier to control. The sweetener for shareholders is that BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie is sticking to his promise of a \u201cprogressive\u201d dividend. Thus, from the point of view of shareholders who will get one South32 share for every BHP share they own, any dividend that flows from the liberated entity counts as an effective increase. Plunging commodity prices could yet ruin both company\u2019s hopes. But demerger seems the right way to confront the risk. For a decade and a half during the bull market, miners were obsessed with getting bigger; this looks a smarter approach. Sainsbury\u2019s doubts So, Sainsbury\u2019s has not been smashed by the assumed revival of Tesco. On current form, the chain is putting up stiffer resistance than, say, Asda. Sainsbury\u2019s like-for-like sales fell 1.9% in the current quarter, a better outcome than doomsters had predicted. But the problem with gauging progress against City estimates is that you miss the wider trend. This was the fifth quarter in a row of declines in like-for-like sales at Sainsbury\u2019s and you would have to be an extreme optimist to believe the run ends now. Inflation on food is running at minus 2.5% and chief executive Mike Coupe expects more deflation for the rest of the year. The unanswered question is what happens when Sainsbury\u2019s has exhausted its \u00a3150m fighting fund of price cuts. Half has been spent, the rest will be dispatched over the next six months. There is no reason to doubt the boast that Sainsbury\u2019s is as competitive on price as it has ever been, but the suspicion remains that more ammunition will be required if Tesco gets back on its feet properly, as opposed to merely staggering to its knees. This was a 10-week trading update without profit or margin figures. It\u2019s no basis from which to make definitive judgments. More price pain for shareholders may lie ahead. Green stays silent Those wondering when Stephen Green \u2013 Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, former chief executive and chairman of HSBC \u2013 will recover the power of speech will have to wait a little longer. Green was due to give a Lent lecture on Wednesday evening at the parish church of St Michael\u2019s Cornhill in the City on the subject of how Germany\u2019s past is shaping its European future. Unfortunately, cancellation notices appeared on Tuesday. No explanation was given, so we don\u2019t know if Green was worried that a parishioner might ask the obvious question: this German stuff is all very interesting, but what can you tell us about HSBC\u2019s past in Switzerland and Mexico while you were the top man? That question still needs to be asked by MPs after the general election. There are signals that will be, thankfully, otherwise the silence would be embarrassing \u2013 both for parliament and for Green. Apologies to Lord Green. It was said here incorrectly on Tuesday that he had cancelled a speech the following day at St Michael\u2019s Cornhill church in London. In fact, the former chief executive and chairman of HSBC gave the speech, as we reported. It was another speech next week at Queen Mary University of London that had been cancelled.",

      "bodyText": "Bank account holders in Jersey, workers in embassies around the world, bookmakers, MPs\u2019 families and even charities have all found themselves out of favour recently with banks that are racing to comply with tough new rules on money laundering and terror financing. The move by HSBC to check the residency of holders of accounts in Jersey is just the latest illustration of this so-called de-risking, as banks pull back from services and places they judge could put them in danger of hefty fines. The issue first came to prominence 18 months ago when Mo Farah joined a campaign over Barclays cutting remittance services to his native Somalia, along with a string of countries in Africa and Asia. In another recent example Iraj Hashi, an economics professor awarded an MBE for his role in helping to rebuild war-torn Kosovo, found his account closed last year by NatWest, part of bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank was accused of simply pulling accounts from individuals who like Hashi are of Iranian origin. More and more charity chiefs are reporting being refused basic bank services, according to Asheem Singh, director of public policy at the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (ACEVO). Groups with links to Muslim organisations have been particularly affected. \u201cIt is hugely corrosive for any charity to be unbanked. It is counterproductive: it forces them into extreme situations such as having to operate with cash only. This in particular gives rise to a situation in which fraud is not only possible but probable,\u201d Singh said. There is no official data on the number of individuals and organisations caught up in the banks\u2019 retrenchment. The World Bank was recently commissioned by the G20 to compile such information, while earlier this month the Financial Action Task Force \u2013 the international body which sets standards for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing \u2013 acknowledged it was a global phenomenon and said it would try to find ways to ease its impact. For now much of the evidence is anecdotal and those affected are often mystified as to why. In a House of Lords debate last year Liberal Democrat Lord Clement-Jones said his son had been unable to access a cash machine while letters to the Racing Post claim HSBC has been closing the accounts of bookmakers. It is thought peers and their families could fall the wrong side of EU rules that single out \u201cpolitically exposed persons\u201d, while bookies are in banks\u2019 sights because they handle large cash transactions. A series of swingeing penalties have spurred the banks into action. HSBC was fined \u00a31.2bn in 2012 by the US authorities for allowing Mexican drug barons to launder money through its branches and hit with a deferred prosecution agreement with the US authorities. Last August, Douglas Flint, HSBC\u2019s chairman, warned the risk of further fines was creating an \u201cobservable and growing danger of disproportionate risk aversion\u201d. That was before last month\u2019s revelations showing how HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking arm had been helping customers avoid tax after account details were leaked to the Guardian and other publications. The British Bankers\u2019 Association\u2019s submission to the Treasury select committee of MPs \u2013 which has been calling for written evidence on the topic \u2013 sets out the impact of the wide range of rules in different jurisdictions. \u201cThe very robust stances of some regulators in major financial centres and the level of fines applied to foreign banks by US authorities, in particularl for financial crime compliance failings, have been material to the very careful risk management approach of BBA member banks,\u201d the BBA said. The Treasury acknowledged there is a problem and Andrea Leadsom, economic secretary to the Treasury, said it was a global trend with global causes. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has also highlighted the issue, warning last month of the risk of \u201cfinancial abandonment\u201d, in which countries or institutions are effectively cut off from the global financial system. Some solutions have been sought. In the case of Syria, the banking industry worked with the Disaster Emergency Commission last year to get money into the country. With regards to Somalia, talks started in November 2013 to create \u201ca safe corridor\u201d to facilitate payments to the country. Rushanara Ali, the MP for Bethnal Green who has been campaigning on the topic, told the Treasury committee last month that the scheme was delayed, although this is disputed by the department for international development and World Bank, which are leading the discussions. A DIFD spokeswoman said: \u201cThe UK-Somalia remittance market is complex and we are working with Somali communities here in the UK, regulators and the government of Somalia to ensure our work meets the specific needs on the ground in Somalia.\u201d",

Rushanara<strong> </strong>Ali, the MP for Bethnal Green who has been campaigning on the topic, told the Treasury committee last month that the scheme was delayed, although this is disputed by the department for international development and World Bank, which are leading the discussions. </p> <p>A DIFD spokeswoman said: \u201cThe UK-Somalia remittance market is complex and we are working with Somali communities here in the UK, regulators and the government of Somalia to ensure our work meets the specific needs on the ground in Somalia.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "<p>The company\u2019s Race Together campaign aims to get people talking about one of the most divisive issues in the US but not everyone wants debate with their latte</p>", 
      "body": "<p>Like a good cappuccino, it all comes frothing out if you just lift the lid. Starting a conversation about race in a Starbucks at 8am is perhaps the ultimate wake-up call, even before the caffeine is sipped \u2013 or so the company chief executive, Howard Shultz, hopes.<br></p> <p>He wants staff and customers at his 7,000-plus coffee shops across the US to break the taboo of race chat, over a tall Pike Place drip or an egg-white muffin.</p> <p>Starbucks began rolling out Race Together on Monday and Tuesday, a corporate project to get people talking about the issues that are inflaming passions coast-to-coast in America.</p> <p>Shultz had held \u201cpartner open forums\u201d for staff (called partners in Starbucks-speak) across the country in December in readiness \u201cto discuss issues of race, prejudice and lack of economic opportunity\u201d (price of a latte notwithstanding) in America, and how baristas could get the conversation going with and between customers.</p> <p>Putting his idea to the test in an actual, busy branch of the coffee shop in downtown Manhattan on a damp Tuesday morning brings mixed results.</p> <p>There are nine people waiting at one end of the counter for their coffee to be served and six people in line at the other end waiting to order. All in monastic silence. Folks squint at their phones, stare at a patch of ceiling, glaze over. Anything but interact. Behind the counter, baristas\u2019 hands are flying, dumping grounds, steaming milk, toasting bagels, jingling cash. Focused.</p> <p>Clearly what everyone needs is an ice-breaker.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think about talking about race issues in Starbucks?\u201d the Guardian asks an elegant woman in a tweed jacket who has just collected her white chocolate mocha with vanilla and whipped cream.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Um, well, if that\u2019s what people want to talk about \u2026,\u201d said wary Latisha Griffiths, 43, an advertising executive on her way to work at an office in New York City\u2019s fashionable SoHo neighborhood.</p> <p>She continued: \u201cI would not strike that conversation up. With strangers. It\u2019s a very touchy subject. A coffee shop is meant to be peaceful and serene, not hostile.\u201d</p> <p>Would she join in a conversation someone else started? Or intervene if she heard someone saying something tactless?</p> <p>\u201cThen I would definitely say something. People need to be educated, but in a way where they don\u2019t feel like they are being attacked. When you\u2019re faced with a certain situation you are able to talk about it if you have been through it, for some people it would be enlightening,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Like what?</p> <p>\u201cLike me walking in a store and people are following you thinking you are going to steal something. I mean, I have a great job, I pay my bills, I\u2019m educated, I can afford this stuff. But you are judged from the outside, by the color of your skin, it\u2019s been a struggle my entire life.\u201d</p> <p>Someone leans in. Are they going to join the spontaneous Starbucks speak-easy moment? </p> <p>No, they are leaning in to shove us out of the way because we are blocking the door.</p> <p>Starbucks staff are being charged with the lofty mission of helping \u201cheal and move the country forward \u2026 creating more empathy, compassion and understanding one conversation at a time\u201d, according to the staff briefing paper freshly printed out, with a picture of a smiling Shultz in one of his coffee shops, and now in the hands of assistant store manager Marley Pagan, 20. \u201cMarley, like Bob,\u201d he says helpfully. </p> <p>Pagan is enthused. He described himself as Latino American from the Lower East Side of Manhattan and said his three years with Starbucks had been racism-free, but he was looking forward to more conversation. \u201cI think it\u2019s good. I think Howard Shultz should run for president. This is going to give us more of a connection with the partners [aka co-workers] and customers, it\u2019s intriguing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One of his colleagues on the roll-out day of the Race Together campaign on Monday had put a sticker on a customer\u2019s coffee cup and posted a picture of it on Twitter. It was promptly retweeted by the company.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a good experience, to be acknowledged for following the movement that we\u2019re all trying to do,\u201d said Pagan, 20. \u201cFrom today I\u2019m going to focus on what reactions we get from customers. We can write it on the cups, stick a sticker on the cups or on our aprons, talk about it, or not, it\u2019s optional,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The briefing paper from head office says: \u201cWith racial tension, protests and violence happening across our country, in the same neighborhoods where our stores are located and where our partners and customers live and work, we cannot ignore our community role in fostering empathy and understanding.\u201d</p> <p>All stores should participate by Wednesday, continues the brief.</p> <p>Staff may, if they choose, write Race Together or just Together on cups.</p> <p>\u201cIf customers don\u2019t want Race Together on their cup, don\u2019t write it. Or make them a new beverage in a cup without these words written on it. You know your customers best and we trust you to make the call,\u201d says the brief.</p> <p>Baristas at the Spring Street Starbucks in SoHo know their customers are in a rush at 8am and they are not, at this moment, stopping to write or put stickers on cups.</p> <p>But barista Kadeem Manning, 20, neat in a black fedora, white tie and a Race Together sticker on his green apron, is going to be up for it later.</p> <p>\u201cIt gives us more things to talk about with the customers,\u201d he said. Having arrived seven months ago with his mother from Jamaica, to live in the Bronx, Manning admitted he had not been following events in Ferguson, Missouri, very closely, or other deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of the police, such as the choking of Eric Garner in New York\u2019s Staten Island last summer.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had any problems myself,\u201d he said. And early reactions from customers had been \u201cgood\u201d he said, although he had not yet noticed any full-blown debates spilling out over the lattes.</p> <p>\u201cTalk about race \u2013 in Starbucks? That\u2019s bizarre,\u201d said Bridget Andrews, 39, marching from the utilitarian coffee shop, past faux belle \u00e9poque rival cafe Balthazar to a stretch of Broadway teeming with rush-hour foot traffic, coffee in hand and never breaking stride.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an environment I would want to talk about race in. Maybe at home with friends and family. When I\u2019m in Starbucks I\u2019m in there for about three minutes, tops, and I want to get my coffee and go,\u201d she said. Within a \u201cNew York minute\u201d she had disappeared into Top Shop on Broadway, where she is a fashion buyer.</p> <p>Lining up for a drip coffee, Scott Morgan, 52, who works for the Aids advocacy organization Treatment Action Group, said a thoughtful, polite but firm: \u201cNo, no \u2026 no\u201d to Howard Shultz\u2019s invitation to talk about race with his barista.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, in this country there is a lot of dissension and a lot of divisiveness, a lot of issues that we have got to address,\u201d he acknowledged.</p> <p>But not in Starbucks?</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jazan Higgins, \u201cof a certain age\u201d and in book publishing, said it would depend on her mood.</p> <p>How was her mood today?</p> <p>\u201cLow key,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe during the afternoon it would be more conducive,\u201d she said, helpfully.</p> <p>On social media the Race Together campaign is getting some buzz.</p> <p>\u201cLove not hate. Understanding not stereotypes #Race Together,\u201d said one tweet.</p> <p>\u201cForward together or not at all,\u201d said another.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the prob with @Starbucks #RaceTogether that it\u2019s ridic to have a serious talk in 23 seconds at the register?\u201d asked one non-fan.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome to Starbucks, let\u2019s discuss your white privilege. Don\u2019t ask for your coffee \u2018black\u2019,\u201d someone tweeted.</p> <p>Conservative commentator Will Antonin posted: \u201cI, for one, would love to see Starbucks\u2019 clientele discuss how Elizabeth Warren posed as Native American for her own advantage.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Starbucks Partners\u2019 Facebook page asks: \u201cShall we overcome?\u201d above pictures of the recent staff mass meetings and videos with Howard Shultz talking about the race campaign.</p> <p>From SoHo to the corporate headquarters in Seattle, the verdict is still brewing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Like a good cappuccino, it all comes frothing out if you just lift the lid. Starting a conversation about race in a Starbucks at 8am is perhaps the ultimate wake-up call, even before the caffeine is sipped \u2013 or so the company chief executive, Howard Shultz, hopes. He wants staff and customers at his 7,000-plus coffee shops across the US to break the taboo of race chat, over a tall Pike Place drip or an egg-white muffin. Starbucks began rolling out Race Together on Monday and Tuesday, a corporate project to get people talking about the issues that are inflaming passions coast-to-coast in America. Shultz had held \u201cpartner open forums\u201d for staff (called partners in Starbucks-speak) across the country in December in readiness \u201cto discuss issues of race, prejudice and lack of economic opportunity\u201d (price of a latte notwithstanding) in America, and how baristas could get the conversation going with and between customers. Putting his idea to the test in an actual, busy branch of the coffee shop in downtown Manhattan on a damp Tuesday morning brings mixed results. There are nine people waiting at one end of the counter for their coffee to be served and six people in line at the other end waiting to order. All in monastic silence. Folks squint at their phones, stare at a patch of ceiling, glaze over. Anything but interact. Behind the counter, baristas\u2019 hands are flying, dumping grounds, steaming milk, toasting bagels, jingling cash. Focused. Clearly what everyone needs is an ice-breaker. \u201cWhat do you think about talking about race issues in Starbucks?\u201d the Guardian asks an elegant woman in a tweed jacket who has just collected her white chocolate mocha with vanilla and whipped cream. \u201cWhat? Um, well, if that\u2019s what people want to talk about \u2026,\u201d said wary Latisha Griffiths, 43, an advertising executive on her way to work at an office in New York City\u2019s fashionable SoHo neighborhood. She continued: \u201cI would not strike that conversation up. With strangers. It\u2019s a very touchy subject. A coffee shop is meant to be peaceful and serene, not hostile.\u201d Would she join in a conversation someone else started? Or intervene if she heard someone saying something tactless? \u201cThen I would definitely say something. People need to be educated, but in a way where they don\u2019t feel like they are being attacked. When you\u2019re faced with a certain situation you are able to talk about it if you have been through it, for some people it would be enlightening,\u201d she said. Like what? \u201cLike me walking in a store and people are following you thinking you are going to steal something. I mean, I have a great job, I pay my bills, I\u2019m educated, I can afford this stuff. But you are judged from the outside, by the color of your skin, it\u2019s been a struggle my entire life.\u201d Someone leans in. Are they going to join the spontaneous Starbucks speak-easy moment? No, they are leaning in to shove us out of the way because we are blocking the door. Starbucks staff are being charged with the lofty mission of helping \u201cheal and move the country forward \u2026 creating more empathy, compassion and understanding one conversation at a time\u201d, according to the staff briefing paper freshly printed out, with a picture of a smiling Shultz in one of his coffee shops, and now in the hands of assistant store manager Marley Pagan, 20. \u201cMarley, like Bob,\u201d he says helpfully. Pagan is enthused. He described himself as Latino American from the Lower East Side of Manhattan and said his three years with Starbucks had been racism-free, but he was looking forward to more conversation. \u201cI think it\u2019s good. I think Howard Shultz should run for president. This is going to give us more of a connection with the partners [aka co-workers] and customers, it\u2019s intriguing,\u201d he said. One of his colleagues on the roll-out day of the Race Together campaign on Monday had put a sticker on a customer\u2019s coffee cup and posted a picture of it on Twitter. It was promptly retweeted by the company. \u201cThat was a good experience, to be acknowledged for following the movement that we\u2019re all trying to do,\u201d said Pagan, 20. \u201cFrom today I\u2019m going to focus on what reactions we get from customers. We can write it on the cups, stick a sticker on the cups or on our aprons, talk about it, or not, it\u2019s optional,\u201d he said. The briefing paper from head office says: \u201cWith racial tension, protests and violence happening across our country, in the same neighborhoods where our stores are located and where our partners and customers live and work, we cannot ignore our community role in fostering empathy and understanding.\u201d All stores should participate by Wednesday, continues the brief. Staff may, if they choose, write Race Together or just Together on cups. \u201cIf customers don\u2019t want Race Together on their cup, don\u2019t write it. Or make them a new beverage in a cup without these words written on it. You know your customers best and we trust you to make the call,\u201d says the brief. Baristas at the Spring Street Starbucks in SoHo know their customers are in a rush at 8am and they are not, at this moment, stopping to write or put stickers on cups. But barista Kadeem Manning, 20, neat in a black fedora, white tie and a Race Together sticker on his green apron, is going to be up for it later. \u201cIt gives us more things to talk about with the customers,\u201d he said. Having arrived seven months ago with his mother from Jamaica, to live in the Bronx, Manning admitted he had not been following events in Ferguson, Missouri, very closely, or other deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of the police, such as the choking of Eric Garner in New York\u2019s Staten Island last summer. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any problems myself,\u201d he said. And early reactions from customers had been \u201cgood\u201d he said, although he had not yet noticed any full-blown debates spilling out over the lattes. \u201cTalk about race \u2013 in Starbucks? That\u2019s bizarre,\u201d said Bridget Andrews, 39, marching from the utilitarian coffee shop, past faux belle \u00e9poque rival cafe Balthazar to a stretch of Broadway teeming with rush-hour foot traffic, coffee in hand and never breaking stride. \u201cThat\u2019s not an environment I would want to talk about race in. Maybe at home with friends and family. When I\u2019m in Starbucks I\u2019m in there for about three minutes, tops, and I want to get my coffee and go,\u201d she said. Within a \u201cNew York minute\u201d she had disappeared into Top Shop on Broadway, where she is a fashion buyer. Lining up for a drip coffee, Scott Morgan, 52, who works for the Aids advocacy organization Treatment Action Group, said a thoughtful, polite but firm: \u201cNo, no \u2026 no\u201d to Howard Shultz\u2019s invitation to talk about race with his barista. \u201cRight now, in this country there is a lot of dissension and a lot of divisiveness, a lot of issues that we have got to address,\u201d he acknowledged. But not in Starbucks? \u201cMaybe not,\u201d he said. Jazan Higgins, \u201cof a certain age\u201d and in book publishing, said it would depend on her mood. How was her mood today? \u201cLow key,\u201d she muttered. \u201cMaybe during the afternoon it would be more conducive,\u201d she said, helpfully. On social media the Race Together campaign is getting some buzz. \u201cLove not hate. Understanding not stereotypes #Race Together,\u201d said one tweet. \u201cForward together or not at all,\u201d said another. \u201cIsn\u2019t the prob with @Starbucks #RaceTogether that it\u2019s ridic to have a serious talk in 23 seconds at the register?\u201d asked one non-fan. \u201cWelcome to Starbucks, let\u2019s discuss your white privilege. Don\u2019t ask for your coffee \u2018black\u2019,\u201d someone tweeted. Conservative commentator Will Antonin posted: \u201cI, for one, would love to see Starbucks\u2019 clientele discuss how Elizabeth Warren posed as Native American for her own advantage.\u201d The Starbucks Partners\u2019 Facebook page asks: \u201cShall we overcome?\u201d above pictures of the recent staff mass meetings and videos with Howard Shultz talking about the race campaign. From SoHo to the corporate headquarters in Seattle, the verdict is still brewing.",

      "bodyText": "With the continuing war of words between Greece and the eurozone, a fall on Wall Street ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s statement on Wednesday and a disappointing German confidence survey, markets ended in negative territory for the most part. An exception was the UK, with oil companies boosted by hopes for tax breaks in Wednesday\u2019s Budget statement. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 33.53 points or 0.49% higher at 6837.61 Germany\u2019s Dax fell back from Monday\u2019s record to end 1.54% lower at 11,980.85 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.64% down at 5028.93 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 0.91% to 22,723.06 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.78% at 11,028.1 The Athens market added 0.88% to 769.77 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 111 points or 0.62% lower. On that note its time to close up for the evening, and thanks for all your comments. Greece has reacted with fury to Dijsselbloem\u2019s comments raising the prospect of a Cyprus style bail-in on Greek banks, reports our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith. \u201cIt would be useful for all if Mr Dijsselbloem respects his institutional role in the euro zone. It is hard for us to comprehend the reasons that propel him to make statements that are not in accordance with the role that he has been given,\u201d said the government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides in a hard-hitting statement. The Eurogroup chief was peddling fantasy scenarios, he added. \u201cWe consider it unnecessary to remind [everyone] that the Greek republic cannot be blackmailed.\u201d Here\u2019s a full report from Bloomberg on Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem and his comments on possible capital controls to prevent a Grexit: [Dijsselbloem] raised the possibility of using capital controls to prevent Greece from leaving the euro, the most explicit mention of that option to date by a top European policy maker. Dijsselbloem, who heads the group of euro area finance ministers, told BNR Nieuwsradio Tuesday that the 2013 Cypriot bailout shows temporarily shutting banks and restricting the flow of capital could stabilize Greece\u2019s financial system and allow it to remain part of the currency union. \u201cIt\u2019s been explored what should happen if a country gets into deep trouble -- that doesn\u2019t immediately have to be an exit scenario,\u201d he said. For Cyprus, \u201cwe had to take radical measures, banks were closed for a while and capital flows within and out of the country were tied to all kinds of conditions, but you can think of all kinds of scenarios.\u201d The full report is here. Greece is calling for fair treatment not special treatment from the rest of the eurozone. An article in the FT by Greek deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis, co-authored by finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and minister for international economic affairs Euclid Tsakalotos says: It is a common belief that the Greek government is seeking special treatment relative to other stressed eurozone members. We are not; we are seeking equal treatment. Since the onset of the crisis, our economy has shrunk 26%; unemployment has risen from 8 to 26%; and wages have declined 33%. These outcomes are worse than those experienced by any country during the 1930s and far worse than those projected under the two Greek adjustment programmes. This is why the Greek government has criticised these programmes... While the crisis has made matters worse for Greece and others, it has had unintended \u2014 but positive \u2014 consequences for \u201ccore\u201d eurozone countries. Germany and others have benefited from exchange and interest rates that are lower than they would have faced had they still had their own currencies.... [Greece] is in a position like that of Sisyphus \u2014 a man condemned to roll a boulder to the top of a hill, only to see it roll down again. Greeks have implemented austerity and have suffered much more than expected. Many of the 60% of young people out of work will one day be reclassified as long-term unemployed. We risk condemning an entire generation to a future without hope. To avoid that, what we ask from our eurozone partners is to treat Greece as an equal and help us escape from this Sisyphean trap. The full piece is here (\u00a3): All we ask is that Europe give Greece a chance The International Monetary Fund has cut its estimate for Portugal\u2019s budget deficit this year to 3.2% of GDP from its 3.4% forecast in January. But this is still higher than the 2.7% predicted by the country\u2019s government, and the IMF said Portugal needs to press ahead with structural reforms: Portugal\u2019s economic recovery is expected to strengthen this year. Under the economic adjustment program, severe imbalances were corrected, growth was restored and unemployment began to decline. However, long-standing challenges will require sustained structural reforms. A confluence of positive external factors \u2013 a more favorable euro exchange rate, a highly supportive monetary policy environment, and low oil prices - provides an excellent window of opportunity to undertake these reforms. The full statement from the IMF mission is here. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has apparently been upping the ante in the tortuous stand off between Greece and the eurozone: And speaking of wartime reparations, here are the latest developments: Several senior Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens in Germany have for the first time said their nation should consider paying reparations to Greece for Nazi crimes committed during the second world war, breaking ranks with Angela Merkel\u2019s government. Relations between Germany and Greece have deteriorated as Athens tries to renegotiate its bailout terms and Berlin fears it will ditch previously agreed financial promises. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who is due to meet Merkel in Berlin on Monday, has accused Germany of using tricks to avoid paying reparations. One of his ministers raised the prospect of seizing German property to compensate victims of a Nazi massacre. While Berlin says it has honoured its obligations, including a DM115m payment to Greece in 1960 (around \u00a345m at the time), some mainstream German politicians have gone against government policy and said it was impossible to draw a line under the highly charged issue. Full story here: German politicians admit Greece has case for wartime reparations Back with Greece, and I think this comes under the heading of \u201cevery little helps\u201d: Wall Street has opened sharply lower after Monday\u2019s rally, ahead of the two day US Federal Reserve meeting which begins today. The central bank\u2019s statement about interest rates and its economic projections will be released on Wednesday. Economists will be watching the wording of the statement carefully to try and gauge when the Fed will raise rates. It could all boil down to one word: if the central bank removes its pledge to be \u201cpatient\u201d about lifting rates, this could start the clock ticking in earnest. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe said: It\u2019s not often that a crucial monetary policy statement boils down to one word, but [Federal Reserve chair] Janet Yellen has created the perfect set of circumstances for markets to do just this with this week\u2019s Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting. In her recent testimony, Yellen said that rates could rise at any subsequent meeting, just as soon as the Fed removes the word \u2018patient\u2019 from its statement on tightening monetary policy. Market attention will therefore be firmly fixed on whether the Fed is confident enough in the recovery to remove this word. We\u2019ve seen some soft data from the US recently, for example Friday\u2019s Producer Price Index which indicated potential weakness in consumer prices, and the Fed has grounds to continue being patient with rate hikes. However, with expectations so high for a hawkish FOMC statement any disappointment could lead to a large pullback in the dollar, which has been utterly rampant this month. Ahead of the meeting the Dow Jones Industrial Average has opened lower and is now down almost 160 points or 0.89%, on the basis that a rate rise will strengthen the dollar further - despite the caveat from Berich above - which in turn would hurt stocks. Time for a quick recap: Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has intensified his diplomatic efforts over the county\u2019s bailout. Tsipras is pushing for a five-way meeting to discuss Greece\u2019s funding needs, during the two-day EU Summit starting on Thursday. He hopes that discussions with Angela Merkel, Mario Draghi, Jean-Claude Juncker and Francois Hollande could help to get financial aid flowing to Greece again. A Greek official has told Reuters that Tsipras made the request personally to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, in an attempt to find a political breakthrough. Tsipras is also due in Berlin next Monday to meet Merkel; government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis says: \u201cIt will be a meeting of substance, not a meeting for communication purposes or a \u2018photo opportunity\u2019 in Berlin.\u201d But Greece is also looking East. Tsipras\u2019s office has confirmed that the PM will visit Moscow next month, for talks with president Putin. Tsipras had been expected to visit Russia in May, to take part in Russia\u2019s Victory Parade (marking its World War 2 victory). But, with cash reserves running short, an earlier trip has been scheduled in. One government source told AFP that: \u201cThe prime minister will visit the Kremlin following an invitation from Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u201d The Ta Nea newspaper, though, reckons that Athens pushed for an early meeting due to \u201cstifling economic conditions caused in the country from the European side.\u201d Greece\u2019s creditors are still looking for signs that Athens is implementing economic reforms before it unlocks any of its \u20ac7.2bn bailout payment. Officials from the Eurozone\u2019s Working Group will discuss the state of play there this afternoon, on a conference call. And in the absence of a breakthrough, Greek MPs will begin debating measures to boost liquidity today. Bloomberg reports: Unable to access bailout funding and locked out of capital markets, the government will outline emergency plans to parliament later Tuesday that includes incentives for tax delinquents to pay up before March 27, when the government needs money for monthly salaries and pensions. The uncertainty over Greece\u2019s future still looms over the markets. One Bank of England official has told MPs that a \u201cbad outcome\u201d could cause a market correction. But the wider European economy is looking a little healthier. German economic sentiment has hit a 13-month high Car sales have risen for the 18th month running. Eurostat has confirmed that eurozone inflation rose to minus 0.3% last month Heads-up. Euro-area finance ministry officials are expected to hold a conference call this afternoon to discuss Greece\u2019s finances, from 3.30pm GMT (5.30pm local time). That\u2019s a Working Group meeting, points out Efi Efthimiou of financial website CapitalGR. Back in parliament, Bank of England official Alex Brazier has predicted that Greek\u2019s debt problems could spark a selloff in the financial markets. Brazier (the BoE\u2019s executive director for financial stability) told the Treasury committee that investors could be spooked if the Greek bailout negotiations flounder. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from Bloomberg: \u201cA bad outcome in these negotiations could trigger a broader reassessment of risk in financial markets..... \u201cWe start from a position where market pricing looks potentially subject to correction. I don\u2019t view Greece as a big direct risk but it could potentially be a trigger for a market reappraisal\u201d Brazier also declined to speculate on whether Greece might leave the eurozone; pointing out that it\u2019s not just an economic issue. He said: Although the economic issue is in some ways very simple -- there\u2019s a debt overhang that needs to be dealt with -- the way that is dealt with is a political issue and I don\u2019t presume to be able to forecast [that] in any way. And as mentioned earlier, Brazier also warned that it\u2019s not realistic to expect Greece to repay all its debts. Although today\u2019s inflation data showed eurozone prices fell by 0.3% in February, \u2018core inflation\u2019 was actually up by 0.7%. And prices should be pushed higher as ECB\u2019s new QE programme drives the euro down and raises confidence. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: It is clearly too soon for quantitative easing to be credited with the improvements in inflation and employment, but there is little doubt that Mario Draghi\u2019s \u20ac60bn per month programme has lifted sentiment. QE has also resulted in a weaker euro, which should benefit both exporters and domestically-focused firms. Draghi is fortunate that QE appears to be coinciding with a cyclical recovery \u2013 the programme will probably be hailed a success, but in truth the improvement in data may have still happened in its absence. In the final analysis it will make little difference. If the patient recovers, does it matter whether that recovery is due to the medicine working or a placebo effect? Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, adds: \u201cA closer look at the inflation data shows that the cost of la dolce vita is actually increasing across the eurozone, with restaurants, cafes, tobacco and rent prices leading the rise. Once food, fuel and other volatile items are excluded, core inflation was a much healthier 0.7 per cent year-on-year. It\u2019s important to remember this data doesn\u2019t even include most of the effects of the ECB\u2019s QE programme, which only started this month. The euro nosedived in March and this will definitely begin to show through in the next batch of figures, boosting the improvement in inflation that today\u2019s data has shown.\u201d Bookmaker Paddy Power has hiked the odds on Greece leaving the eurozone this year from 5/1 to 10/1, concluding that Grexit looks less likely. Here\u2019s the latest odds: 6/4: Greece to adopt official currency other than the Euro by the end of 2018 3/1: Greece to hold another general election in 2015 7/1: European commission to confirm that Greece has \u2018defaulted\u2019 on debt in 2015 10/1: Greece to exit the Euro in 2015 The filmmaker who shot Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s Zagreb lecture in 2013 has criticised the media for their coverage of the now-notorious \u2018middle finger\u2019 gesture. Martin Beros says the clip was taken \u2018out of context\u2019; German TV, he says, fudged the fact Varoufakis was talking about events back in 2010. The row shows that many mainstream media outlets aren\u2019t able to engage with and analyse complex narratives, and want to reduce the debt crisis to gestures and posturing, Beros adds. (hopefully that\u2019s the last word on Mittelfinger-Streit) There\u2019s no word from Berlin on how the Merkel-Draghi talks are progressing. But we have heard from Reuters that Greek PM Alexis Tsipras wants to meet them both at the next EU summit on Thursday. Tsipras is hoping that European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and French President Francois Hollande will also attend, in an attempt to break the deadlock and unlock financial aid for Greece. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect Greece to repay all its debts, according to a senior Bank of England policymaker. Alex Brazier, the BoE\u2019s executive director for financial stability strategy and risk, also told MPs on the Treasury Committee this morning that the Greek debt crisis could be a threat to UK companies. Europe\u2019s jobs crisis eased last year, but there\u2019s still a long way to go. Eurostat reported that employment across the eurozone rose by 0.9% over the last year, and by 0.1% in the final three months of 2014. That means the eurozone has clawed back some, but not all, of the jobs lost since the debt crisis began. Eurostat adds: Spain and Latvia (both +0.7%), Ireland and Slovakia (both +0.6%) recorded the highest increases in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with the previous quarter. Portugal (-1.4%), Cyprus (-0.6%), Poland (-0.3%), Italy (-0.2%) and Malta (-0.1%) recorded decreases. Readers in Athens may be reaching for the ear plugs today; F16 fighter jets are roaring overhead in preparation for National Independence Day on March 25. Helena reminds me that the air show was stopped a few years ago; perhaps the new Greek government is keen to celebrate the country\u2019s sovereignty. At least the fuel costs will be lower this year -- given the tumble on the oil price. German economic confidence has hit its highest level in over a year, despite the Ukraine crisis and Greece\u2019s debt woes. The ZEW think tank\u2019s monthly survey of sentiment rose to 54.8, up from 53.0 last month. That\u2019s the highest since February 2014. ZEW polled around 219 German analysts and investors over the last fortnight, and found that many are more upbeat about the eurozone\u2019s economic prospects. Economists had expected a higher reading, though, of around 58.2. ZEW warned that the limited progress in tackling the Greek debt crisis, and the Ukraine conflict, was dampening sentiment. It\u2019s official: Alexis Tsipras is off to Moscow next month: Prices across the eurozone fell by 0.3% year-on-year in February, Eurostat has confirmed, in line with its preliminary estimate. The data also shows that Greece lurched deeper into deflation, with prices down 1.9% annually. Britons are spending more on electric cigarettes and craft beer, and less on sat navs and foreign exchange commissions, according to the Office for National Statistics\u2019s annual shake-up of its inflation basket. The ONS has also added online music streaming, swanky headphones and sweet potatoes to the basket, and kicked out yoghurt drinks, in an attempt to better mirror what we actually spend money on. More here: E-cigarettes and craft beer added to the CPI basket of goods Greece\u2019s authoritative Ta Nea is reporting that prime minister Alexis Tsipras has accepted an invitation from Russian president Vladimir Putin to visit Moscow on April 8th. It comes as the US top diplomat Victoria Nuland holds talks in Athens today amid mounting concerns that a financial collapse of Greece could push the country into Russia\u2019s orbit. Nuland is expected to meet Tsipras at 6pm local time (4pm GMT) Moscow has said that it would seriously study a Greek request for financial help if ever asked. Athens is playing the geopolitical card in its ongoing negotiations with creditors, points out our correspondent Helena Smith. And an update on \u201cfingergate\u201d - the latest scandal to ruffle Greek-German relations. The plot has thickened says Helena Smith, following the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 decision to upload the offending video in its entirety on his Twitter account overnight. What has rather taken the Greek media aback is that the then economics professor is indeed shown making the rude gesture at the 40-minute mark of the filmed talk he presents to a packed audience in Zagreb. When presented with the video by Germany\u2019s most popular ARD TV program on Sunday, he had denounced the video as \u201ca fake\u201d saying immediately that it had obviously been doctored. Greek commentators are now wondering what to make of it all! Relations between Germany and Greece continue to deteriorate. Last night, German finance chief Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said Athens\u2019s new government had destroyed the trust the country had regained with its European partners in recent years. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reported: \u201cThe new Greek government has totally destroyed the trust of its European partners \u2026 this is a serious setback,\u201d the veteran politician, widely seen as the architect of austerity, told a panel in Berlin. \u201cUntil November, Athens was on a road that could have lead it to exit the crisis. This has gone. I don\u2019t know what to do now with Greece.\u201d The German newspapers, meanwhile, are fixated on whether finance minister Yanis Varoufakis once suggested Greece should have given German \u2018the finger\u2019 (as he denied on Sunday). It makes the front page of the Bild tabloid... European stock markets have hit new post-crisis highs this morning. The FTSEurofirst 300 index, which contains the biggest companies across Europe, rose by 0.1% in early trading to its highest level since late 2007. Volkswagen shares are up 2.2%, after this morning\u2019s car registration figures showed VW sales had jumped last month. The Merkel-Draghi meeting starts in an hour or so: There\u2019s a one in four chance that Greece will quit the eurozone by the autumn, sending the euro sliding, says investment bank Morgan Stanley this morning. Morgan Stanley has also changed its mind about the wisdom of buying Greek debt..... UK consumers can look forward to falling prices. Supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s has predicted that food costs will keep dropping through 2015, as it reported its fifth quarter of declining sales. CEO Mike Coupe says: Food deflation is likely to persist for the rest of this calendar year, and competitive pressures on price will continue.\u201d Mario Draghi isn\u2019t the only central bank chief with problems. Over in Japan, governor Haruhiko Kuroda has admitted that the Japanese inflation rate could soon turn negative. Falling oil prices forced Kuroda to slash his inflation forecasts earlier today, despite the trillions of yen the BOJ has thrown at the economy in an attempt to spur demand and drive prices higher. Kuroda insisted that the BoJ will still hit its 2% inflation target in around two years, having weakened the yen dramatically in an attempt to stimulate Japan\u2019s economy and end its deflationary malaise. Car sales across the European Union have risen for the 18th month running, as the region\u2019s bruised auto industry continues to recover. New car registrations jumped by 7.3% year-on-year in February, with growth across the region, industry body ACEA reported. Sales surged by 26.1% in Spain, as a scrappage scheme continued to boost demand, followed by Italy (+13.2%), the UK (+12.0%), Germany (+6.6%) and France (+4.5%). European car sales finally turned the corner last year, after falling steadily since the financial crisis begin. Angela Merkel will be pleased to hear that German carmakers are benefitting from the revival. Annual BMW registrations surged by 16.8% in February, with Volkswagen up 11.1% and Daimler up 13.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The two most powerful people in the eurozone are meeting face-to-face in Berlin to discuss the state of the single currency. German chancellor Angela Merkel is entertaining European Central Bank president Mario Draghi in her office this morning. The gathering is dubbed as a \u201croutine exchange on current eurozone issues\u201d, which ought to include the Greek crisis, Draghi\u2019s huge QE stimulus programme, and the (slowly improving) eurozone economy. Draghi set the scene for today\u2019s talks last night, telling an audience in Frankfurt that the European economy is healing. \u201cMost indicators suggest a sustained recovery is taking hold...\u201d The ECB chief also called for closer political union to strengthen the single currency, declaring: \u201cA nascent recovery provides us with a window of opportunity, with the conditions to press ahead with reforms that will make the euro area less fragile and vulnerable to shocks.\u201d New data due this morning will show whether this recovery continues. At 10am GMT we get the latest ZEW survey of German economic confidence, which may show optimism is rising in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Updated eurozone inflation data is also due, probably confirming that prices fell by 0.3% year-on-year last month. And a fresh employment survey is likely to show that too many Europeans are still out of work. The Merkel-Draghi meeting comes as technical talks between Greece\u2019s creditors and the government over its economic reforms continue, in the hope of making enough progress to unlock some bailout funds soon. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

I started at McSorley\u2019s on a Friday.\u201d</p> <p>Historically, many young Irish immigrants had only two options \u2013 working at a construction site or behind a bar. At 21, Buggy had already spent over four years bartending back home in Ireland, but bartending in New York terrified him.</p> <p>\u201cI was dreading learning about the high-end cocktails \u2013 this, that and the other \u2013 and the computer system. Then I walk into McSorley\u2019s, which is a cash bar with two beers,\u201d he laughs.</p> <p>A lot has changed over the past seven years, and Buggy learning more about cocktails and computer systems has been the least of it. The industry as a whole has undergone a transformation. For one, the demand for craft beers has grown exponentially in the past three to four years. Some expect the number of craft breweries to increase <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101124259#.\">by thousands more in the next few years</a>.</p> <p>The true moment of validation for craft breweries might have come at the end of 2013, when even Guinness had to admit that it struggled to hold its own in the US market. </p> <p>Who is to blame? Young people, who flock to craft beers, or \u201c<a href=\"http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140518/HOSPITALITY_TOURISM/140519535/last-call-for-citys-irish-pubs\">new entrants in flavored beer</a>\u201d, according to Guinness.<br></p> <p>There\u2019s also been an explosion in demand for whiskey. In the past two years, barely a month has gone by without <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/08/bourbon-whiskey-no-shortage\">another warning about a potential whiskey or bourbon shortage</a>. In 2013, exports of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey exceeded $1bn, up from $400m 10 years ago, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/2014/06/02/whiskey-shortage-tenessee-whiskey-craft-distillers/9888069/\">according to David Ozgo, chief economist for the Distilled Spirits Council</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/thirsty-millennials-gents-drive-spirits-irish-whiskey-recorded-largest-increase-22-article-1.1072583\">Blame millennials</a>.

The previous bar offered 60 different types of whiskey. When it opened, The Copper Still offered 80. Three weeks later, it upped that to 100.</p> <p>\u201cNow we are up to 200 whiskeys, because the demand is there. People want this? Let\u2019s give them what they want,\u201d says Buggy, pointing out the additional shelving built to fit the selection. \u201cWe brought in the unique whiskey, a lot of rare whiskeys, and then the household names that people want. We were surprised with that demand. We thought 80 was going to be more than enough. We never expected anything like this.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/14/craft-distillers-brooklyn-whisky-bourbon-chocolate\">Craft whiskey distillers in Brooklyn?

As <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/112723/gallup-daily-us-consumer-spending.aspx\">consumer spending</a> started to recover after the 2008 recession, customers became less interested in low prices and more interested in the value of what they were spending their money on, he says. Forget the $3 beers and budget shots.<br></p> <p>Dempsey\u2019s is half a dozen blocks south of The Copper Still. Nestled between them is Stewart\u2019s bar: Cooper\u2019s Craft and Kitchen. It\u2019s not actually an Irish pub \u2013 more like a gastropub that sells a variety of craft beers. Thomas O\u2019Byrne, one of Cooper\u2019s three co-owners,<strong> </strong>owns Dempsey\u2019s and Sl\u00e1inte, both traditional Irish pubs. The third co-owner, David Clarke, also started out as a bartender at Dempsey\u2019s, like Stewart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://instagram.com/p/za6S8Gn1Je/?taken-by=coopersnyc\" data-alt=\"Cooper's craft and kitchen\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/za6S8Gn1Je/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Come down and watch the #Oscars with us!

In December, the owners opened another location in Chelsea.

We saw the rise of the foodie.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s those foodies and their whims that could pay the bills and keep a local watering hole in business.

In his spare time, Buggy can be found in the East Village at his own bar: The Copper Still. \u201cI came to America just for the experience, and I ended up falling in love with New York,\u201d he says. \u201cI landed on a Wednesday. I started at McSorley\u2019s on a Friday.\u201d Historically, many young Irish immigrants had only two options \u2013 working at a construction site or behind a bar. At 21, Buggy had already spent over four years bartending back home in Ireland, but bartending in New York terrified him. \u201cI was dreading learning about the high-end cocktails \u2013 this, that and the other \u2013 and the computer system. Then I walk into McSorley\u2019s, which is a cash bar with two beers,\u201d he laughs. A lot has changed over the past seven years, and Buggy learning more about cocktails and computer systems has been the least of it. The industry as a whole has undergone a transformation. For one, the demand for craft beers has grown exponentially in the past three to four years. Some expect the number of craft breweries to increase by thousands more in the next few years. The true moment of validation for craft breweries might have come at the end of 2013, when even Guinness had to admit that it struggled to hold its own in the US market. Who is to blame? Young people, who flock to craft beers, or \u201cnew entrants in flavored beer\u201d, according to Guinness. There\u2019s also been an explosion in demand for whiskey. In the past two years, barely a month has gone by without another warning about a potential whiskey or bourbon shortage. In 2013, exports of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey exceeded $1bn, up from $400m 10 years ago, according to David Ozgo, chief economist for the Distilled Spirits Council. Blame millennials. Blame the recession. Blame women who now dare to drink whiskey openly. The point is, change isn\u2019t just coming. It\u2019s already here. In the nine months since The Copper Still has opened, the thing that\u2019s changed is the variety of whiskey on offer, Buggy says. The previous bar offered 60 different types of whiskey. When it opened, The Copper Still offered 80. Three weeks later, it upped that to 100. \u201cNow we are up to 200 whiskeys, because the demand is there. People want this? Let\u2019s give them what they want,\u201d says Buggy, pointing out the additional shelving built to fit the selection. \u201cWe brought in the unique whiskey, a lot of rare whiskeys, and then the household names that people want. We were surprised with that demand. We thought 80 was going to be more than enough. We never expected anything like this.\u201d Meanwhile, Colin Stewart, former bartender and manager at Dempsey\u2019s in New York\u2019s East Village, watched gentrification sweep through the neighborhood \u2013 once \u201cpunkier and edgier\u201d, as he describes it \u2013 from his spot behind the bar. As consumer spending started to recover after the 2008 recession, customers became less interested in low prices and more interested in the value of what they were spending their money on, he says. Forget the $3 beers and budget shots. Dempsey\u2019s is half a dozen blocks south of The Copper Still. Nestled between them is Stewart\u2019s bar: Cooper\u2019s Craft and Kitchen. It\u2019s not actually an Irish pub \u2013 more like a gastropub that sells a variety of craft beers. Thomas O\u2019Byrne, one of Cooper\u2019s three co-owners, owns Dempsey\u2019s and Sl\u00e1inte, both traditional Irish pubs. The third co-owner, David Clarke, also started out as a bartender at Dempsey\u2019s, like Stewart. If you sit down at Cooper\u2019s and ask for a Guinness, the bartender will tell you that you are out of luck. \u201cNot at Cooper\u2019s,\u201d he says, quickly recommending a stout on tap. By keeping a close eye on trends in the industry, Cooper\u2019s, which opened in October 2011, hasn\u2019t just been able to survive, but also to grow. In December, the owners opened another location in Chelsea. They hope to attract Google and other tech companies that have made that neighborhood their home. \u201cWorking, living in the [East Village] neighborhood and working in the beer industry, we knew there was a market for craft beers,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cGastropubs were sought-after too. People wanted their food upgraded. Prices were the last thing they were looking at. We saw the rise of the foodie.\u201d It\u2019s those foodies and their whims that could pay the bills and keep a local watering hole in business. But as bars begin to cater to high-end desires, they could also risk alienating the regulars who just want to enjoy a beer after a long day at work. Arguably, the best example of an Irish-British pub that embraced the rise of the foodie is The Dead Rabbit, which opened in the Financial District in 2013. Above a typical taproom downstairs is the parlor, where waitresses in red dresses and bartenders in suspenders serve fancy cocktails. Groups can order soup tureens full of these tasty concoctions, which are then ladled out of bowls into delicate china teacups. Named one of the top Irish pubs in the US, The Dead Rabbit is often a destination for special occasions rather than a local watering hole, making it the exact opposite of the Irish bars that hope to maintain a blue-collar flavor. Like The Copper Still, for instance. \u201cIt really feels like a local bar right now,\u201d Buggy says. \u201cOur midweek is the best part of our week. When Snowmageddon \u2013 or whatever the hell it was called \u2013 was coming in, I had to come in and ended up working, because we had all the regulars in the neighborhood coming in and enjoying a couple of cocktails.\u201d When they were debating opening their bars, the owners of Cooper\u2019s, Ryan\u2019s Daughter and The Copper Still all said that they wanted to helm venues where they would be comfortable hanging out \u2013 someplace they could feel at home. \u201cMy favorite show growing up was Cheers,\u201d says Mellamphy of Ryan\u2019s Daughter, where an unspoken rule says all tabs are started under the customer\u2019s first name. \u201cAnd it is kind of like Cheers. It\u2019s like a big family.\u201d",

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) updates its basket of goods and services every year to keep pace with changing spending habits.

Melons and sweet potatoes have also been added to the inflation basket, as have protein powders, \u201cto capture the market for sports food supplements\u201d, the ONS said.

Reflecting a trend for people to buy headphones for use with games consoles or as an upgrade to the free pairs that come with smart phones, these are also being added.

      "body": "<p>Jane and Samuel Bluston still look out regally from the back of Blustons ladieswear in Kentish Town, north London.

      "bodyText": "Alliance Trust is facing a new battle over strategy and governance after Elliott Advisors \u2013 part of an activist New York hedge fund \u2013 called for the appointment of three new directors to the board of the Scottish investment group. Elliott, which owns 12% of Alliance\u2019s stock, has written to fellow shareholders calling on them to back the election of three heavyweight business names as non-executives at the firm\u2019s annual shareholding meeting on 29 April. The fund said it had gone public with its demands after its attempts to discuss matters of corporate governance and business concern had \u201cnot been met with any meaningful response\u201d. Alliance, based in Dundee, has 50,000 private investors; many of them pensioners who rely on the investment trust\u2019s dividend, which has increased every year for nearly half a century. In its letter published yesterday, Elliott said the board changed its chairman and all but one non-executive director without any shareholder consultation. It raised particular concerns about the replacement of Alliance\u2019s head of equities, responsible for managing more than 95% of the company\u2019s assets, through internal promotion without inviting external proposals or canvassing shareholders\u2019 views. The letter also criticised Alliance for doubling administrative costs at a time when its peers had been reducing costs. Elliott, which first became an Alliance shareholder in 2010, has put forward Anthony Brooke, a former executive at investment bank SG Warburg, Peter Chambers, a former chief executive of Legal &amp; General Investment Management, and Rory Macnamara, a former corporate finance executive at Morgan Grenfell. It said the three men had been picked by a \u201creputable search firm\u201d. The hedge fund said a failure to consider alternative ideas from \u201cworld-class asset managers\u201d was \u201csymptomatic of broader corporate governance deficiencies and an unwillingness of the board to challenge the status quo\u201d. The push for board changes comes after what Elliott said was persistent underperformance of Alliance Trust\u2019s investment portfolio, concerns about costs and losses at the trust\u2019s operating subsidiaries. \u201cWe believe that the board\u2019s failure to address these concerns and fulfil the company\u2019s full potential is indicative of a system of corporate governance which requires new impetus,\u201d Elliott said in a statement to the stock exchange. Although Elliott does not directly call for the Alliance Trust chief executive, Katherine Garrett-Cox, to go, the move is likely to pile fresh pressure on her after she survived an earlier shareholder rebellion in 2011. Alliance Trust said its board would consider Elliott\u2019s proposal \u201cas it would any proposal made by a shareholder, and will respond in due course\u201d. It urged shareholders \u201cto take no action at this time\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Food prices are likely to continue falling until at least the end of this year, the boss of Sainsbury\u2019s has said as he reported a fifth consecutive quarter of declining sales. The supermarket has absorbed record levels of food deflation as the price of staples such as meat, fish, dairy and fresh ready meals fell, Mike Coupe said. Sainsbury\u2019s has already spent about half the \u00a3150m it set aside in November to fund 12 months\u2019 worth of price cuts, as consumers benefit from a supermarket price war fuelled by the rise of the discount chains and lower global commodity prices. Since November, Sainsbury\u2019s has cut the prices of more than 1,100 products in an attempt to win and retain customers in a tough trading environment. Giving a trading update for the 10 weeks to 14 March, Coupe said: \u201cWe expect the market to remain challenging for the foreseeable future. Food deflation is likely to persist for the rest of this calendar year, and competitive pressures on price will continue.\u201d He said Sainsbury\u2019s food prices were falling by about 2.5%, ahead of the wider market. Falling prices drove sales excluding fuel down 1.9% in the fourth quarter \u2013 stripping out sales at stores open less than a year. The retailer had previously suggested the drop would be about 2%. It was an acceleration from a 1.7% fall in like-for-like sales in the third quarter. Until last March the supermarket had recorded nine straight years of growth. Sainsbury\u2019s said total sales in the fourth quarter slipped 0.3% excluding fuel, as strong growth at its convenience stores and website helped offset declines at its main supermarkets. Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s was \u201cbeginning to see positive signs\u201d of an improvement in trading as the volume of items it was selling had increased and more customers were visiting its stores. Sales of the 1,100 products where prices were cut rose by more than 3%, Coupe said. \u201cThere are some signs that the market is returning to volume growth after perhaps four years of declines,\u201d said James Anstead, an analyst at Barclays. But Coupe cautioned it was \u201ctoo early to call the turn\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any respite any time soon. We can\u2019t rule out the idea that price competition could get more intense rather than less,\u201d he said. The shares rose 2% in early trading to 275p but fell back to trade at 265p, down more than 1% later in the day. While shoppers have about \u00a310 a week more cash to spend partly thanks to falling petrol prices, Coupe said history suggested it could take at least a year of being better off before deciding to spend more on food. He said in the short term people were more likely to buy large consumer goods such as cars or to eat out more. Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s was continuing to invest in the faster growing parts of its business, opening more convenience stores and enabling shoppers to pick up groceries ordered online from 100 stores by the end of this year. The chain is also improving the quality of 3,000 products and replacing some of its previous promotions \u2013 such as three for \u00a310 on some meat and fish products \u2013 in favour of every-day, lower prices, which it called \u201cvalue simplicity\u201d. \u201cThis has been well received by our customers and allows them to budget and shop more conveniently,\u201d Coupe said. He denied Sainsbury\u2019s had been boosting sales with heavy use of discount vouchers. Asda boss Andy Clarke has blamed rivals\u2019 use of vouchers for his chain\u2019s underperformance. But Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s had reduced its promotions. . Phil Dorrell, director of the retail consultancy Retail Remedy, said: \u201cAs silver linings go, it\u2019s not a bad one. The value of sales is down, but volume is up as Sainsbury\u2019s aggressive discounting has lured more people through the door. Those price cuts \u2013 on more than 1,100 products \u2013 are hurting the bottom line in the short term, but in the long term might just stop the rot.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Food prices are likely to continue falling until at least the end of this year, the boss of Sainsbury\u2019s has said as he reported a fifth consecutive quarter of declining sales.</p> <p> </p> <p>The supermarket has absorbed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/04/uk-shop-price-deflation-deepens-as-food-costs-fall\">record levels of food deflation</a> as the price of staples such as meat, fish, dairy and fresh ready meals fell, Mike Coupe said. </p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s has already spent about half the \u00a3150m it set aside in November to fund 12 months\u2019 worth of price cuts, as consumers benefit from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/10/asda-shows-worst-its-sales-performance-in-20-years\">a supermarket price war</a> fuelled by the rise of the discount chains and lower global commodity prices.</p> <p></p> <p>Since November, Sainsbury\u2019s has cut the prices of more than 1,100 products in an attempt to win and retain customers in a tough trading environment.<br></p> <p>Giving a trading update for the 10 weeks to 14 March, Coupe said: \u201cWe expect the market to remain challenging for the foreseeable future. Food deflation is likely to persist for the rest of this calendar year, and competitive pressures on price will continue.\u201d He said Sainsbury\u2019s food prices were falling by about 2.5%, ahead of the wider market.</p> <p>Falling prices drove sales excluding fuel down 1.9% in the fourth quarter \u2013 stripping out sales at stores open less than a year. The retailer had previously suggested the drop would be about 2%. </p> <p>It was an acceleration from a 1.7% fall in like-for-like sales in the third quarter. Until last March the supermarket had recorded nine straight years of growth. </p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s said total sales in the fourth quarter slipped 0.3% excluding fuel, as strong growth at its convenience stores and website helped offset declines at its main supermarkets.</p> <p>Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s was \u201cbeginning to see positive signs\u201d of an improvement in trading as the volume of items it was selling had increased and more customers were visiting its stores. Sales of the 1,100 products where prices were cut rose by more than 3%, Coupe said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere are some signs that the market is returning to volume growth after perhaps four years of declines,\u201d said James Anstead, an analyst at Barclays.</p> <p>But Coupe cautioned it was \u201ctoo early to call the turn\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t see any respite any time soon. We can\u2019t rule out the idea that price competition could get more intense rather than less,\u201d he said.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>As silver linings go, it's not a bad one. The value of sales is down, but volume is up</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The shares rose 2% in early trading to 275p but fell back to trade at 265p, down more than 1% later in the day. </p> <p>While shoppers have about \u00a310 a week more cash to spend partly thanks to falling petrol prices, Coupe said history suggested it could take at least a year of being better off before deciding to spend more on food. He said in the short term people were more likely to buy large consumer goods such as cars or to eat out more.</p> <p>Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s was continuing to invest in the faster growing parts of its business, opening more convenience stores and enabling shoppers to pick up groceries ordered online from 100 stores by the end of this year. The chain is also improving the quality of 3,000 products and replacing some of its previous promotions \u2013 such as three for \u00a310 on some meat and fish products \u2013 in favour of every-day, lower prices, which it called \u201cvalue simplicity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been well received by our customers and allows them to budget and shop more conveniently,\u201d Coupe said. He denied Sainsbury\u2019s had been boosting sales with heavy use of discount vouchers. Asda boss <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/19/asda-expand-retailer-supermarkets-london-england\">Andy Clarke has blamed rivals\u2019 use of vouchers for his chain\u2019s underperformance</a>. But Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s had reduced its promotions.</p> <p>. </p> <p>Phil Dorrell, director of the retail consultancy Retail Remedy, said<strong>: </strong>\u201cAs silver linings go, it\u2019s not a bad one. The value of sales is down, but volume is up as Sainsbury\u2019s aggressive discounting has lured more people through the door. Those price cuts \u2013 on more than 1,100 products \u2013 are hurting the bottom line in the short term, but in the long term might just stop the rot.\u201d</p>",
