Interestingly, Musk also apologised to \u201cthe companies I represent as leader\u201d, which was a rare admission that he failed in his duties as boss. Consider that to be a nod in the direction of those investors in the electric car company who had called for an apology. Yet there\u2019s a wider story here. Musk\u2019s insult to Unsworth was unique in being slanderous but in recent months he has taken swings at Wall Street analysts, the press and short-sellers and even objected to being called \u201ca billionaire\u201d (a denigrating term, apparently). He comes across as absurdly prickly. Or, as Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, a US venture capital firm, said in an \u201copen letter\u201d to Musk this week: \u201cYour behaviour is fuelling an unhelpful perception of your leadership \u2013 thin-skinned and short-tempered.\u201d Few founders of great technology firms have been models of charm and affability, it could be argued.

At Uber, Travis Kalanick\u2019s antics set back the progress of the taxi firm by annoying too many people, including regulators. It would be a shame if Tesla, a genuinely useful company, were to drive down a similar road. Musk should take a break from Twitter, said Munster. Good idea. He would also benefit from having some independent minds in Tesla\u2019s boardroom to remind him that he has investors and employees. The board includes Musk\u2019s brother and two investors in SpaceX, Musk\u2019s space company. The set-up looks too cosy. The UK, arguably, has the opposite problem of shackled founders. We might be better at creating 21st-century technology companies if more pioneers were given Musk\u2019s licence to pursue long-term bets.

Premier Foods cake fight ends in a draw \u2013 probably for the best Neither side deserved to win the cake fight at Premier Foods.

      "bodyText": "With Wall Street lifted by financial stocks after Morgan Stanley\u2019s results, offsetting a dip in technology shares in the wake of the Google fine, European markets have ended the day in positive territory. In the UK, the FTSE 100 benefitted from a drop in the pound following the unexpectedly static inflation figures. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 49.95 points or 0.65% at 7676.28 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.82% to 12,765.94 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.46% higher at 5447.44 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.03% to 21,972.22 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.35% at 9753.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 74 points or 0.3%. Google owner Alphabet is up 0.44% despite the news of the European Commission\u2019s \u20ac4.34bn fine. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave his second day of testimony to Congress, including a discussion on the current trade situation following President Trump\u2019s tariffs. Reuters reports: Powell, questioned by members of a House congressional committee, repeated on Wednesday that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to a U.S. and global expansion that appears largely on track to continue. \u201cIf this process leads to a world of higher tariffs on a wide range of goods and services that are traded and those are sustained for a longer period of time, if it results in a more protectionist world, that would be bad for our economy,\u201d Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. \u201cIt isn\u2019t up to us to criticise (administration) policies. But the evidence is clear that countries that remain open to trade have higher productivity. They have higher incomes.\u201d Powell\u2019s appearance largely retraced the testimony and questioning from a Tuesday hearing with the Senate Banking Committee. In prepared testimony and an accompanying report Powell depicted a U.S. economy poised for perhaps years more continued growth, with the central bank close to its goals of maximum employment and inflation stable at around 2 percent. But as with senators the day before, House members zeroed in on the possible economic consequences of the Trump administration\u2019s imposition of tariffs, with threats of more to come, in the name of cutting better trade deals with both allies like Canada and rivals like China. Powell has tried to walk a fine line in his responses, at once steering clear of direct criticism of the president who appointed him, while also making the economic consequences clear. Powell said he thought the administration\u2019s aim was to ultimately lower tariffs worldwide, and if there was disruption in the meantime \u201cit might be worth paying a bit of a short-term price to get to a better place.\u201d At the same time, he and other Fed officials have been clear that businesses are telling them that they already are changing spending and investment plans because of the risks and uncertainties around a possible trade conflict. Troubled UK outsourcer Capita has seen its shares fall around 2.5% after it said its finance director is stepping down. It said Nick Greatorex would stay with the company for the next few months as it searched for a replacement. Capita, which is cutting costs as it attempts to cut its debt levels, appointed a new chief executive, Jon Lewis, in December. The pound has pulled back from its lowest levels but is still down on the day. Immediately following the unchanged UK inflation figures, which cast doubt on whether the Bank of England would indeed raise interest rates next month, sterling slid to a 10 month low against the dollar of $1.3011. It is now at $1.3042, still down more than 0.5% on the day. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high... These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike. The market expectations of a rate hike slipped to 72% from 77% prior to the release. Back with Google, and Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: In a way Google has become a victim of its own success in terms of its search and marketing capabilities, with little in the way of alternative search and browser options available. In terms of browsing there is Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge, however search options are more limited, with Yahoo and Bing the more well-known names. The solution is likely to be something similar to the solution which Microsoft implemented a few years ago when it had to unbundle Internet Explorer from its operating system to comply with similar EU antitrust rules, allowing the user to choose their own search and browse options. With Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Nato and Russia hogging the headlines, his trade battle with China seemed to have gone a bit quiet. Now one of his advisors has been talking trade again. Reuters reports: U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s top economic adviser said on Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping was \u201cholding up\u201d a deal to resolve a \u201csignificant trade dispute\u201d between the United States and China. Larry Kudlow, head of the White House Economic Council, also said that he expects European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to bring a \u201csignificant\u201d trade offer to Trump when he visits Washington next week. The comments were made to CNBC: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave his latest testimony to the US Senate yesterday, and shortly he will be up before the House of Representatives. His testimony is the same to both committees and can be found here. On yesterday\u2019s comments Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: In his appearance in front of the Senate Banking Committee Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was unequivocal in his upbeat assessment of the US economy. [He] continued with the Fed\u2019s message to continue raising rates gradually as he sees several years of the jobs market remaining strong and inflation steady around 2%. This was music to the ears of the dollar, providing the greenback a welcome distraction from the trade war noise over recent weeks. Overall US markets have edged ahead in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 19 points or 0.06%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are both showing similar percentage gains. Positive results from United Airlines and Morgan Stanley are helping to support industrial and banking shares. The EC ruling on Google is \u201ca bit misguided\u201d but is likely to be a minor inconvenience in the short and medium term, says Colin Sebastian, senior analyst at investment bank Baird. (Given the muted reaction from the company\u2019s share price, the market seems to agree). Sebastian adds: Longer term, we see modest (but not unexpected) added risk from requirements to support forked versions of Android, and secondly, from the direct and/or indirect benefits of this ruling for Apple and Amazon. Overall, this ruling should have a limited direct impact on Google since it ostensibly does not force a change to the Google search algorithm, and it also seems relatively straight-forward for Google to comply. The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon\u2019s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn\u2019t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.) In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip. Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly. At the moment the pre-market price is showing limited damage from the EC fine, down just 0.25%. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, has issued a statement decrying the EC\u2019s decision, and confirming that the company plans to appeal against its fine. Pichai argues that Google\u2019s open source model (which allows manufacturers to modify Android to their purposes) has been good for competition. He also accuses the Commission of favouring proprietary rivals (such as Apple, which keeps a tight hold on its own operating system). Significantly, Pichai states that Google offers phone makers \u201cthe option of pre-loading a suite of popular Google apps\u201d. The EC, though, accuses Google of using \u201ctying practices\u201d and \u201cexclusivity payments\u201d to prevent rivals app-makers getting a foothold on Android. That\u2019s at the heart of today\u2019s fine. Pichai writes: Today, because of Android, a typical phone comes preloaded with as many as 40 apps from multiple developers, not just the company you bought the phone from. If you prefer other apps\u2014or browsers, or search engines\u2014to the preloaded ones, you can easily disable or delete them, and choose other apps instead, including apps made by some of the 1.6 million Europeans who make a living as app developers. In fact, a typical Android phone user will install around 50 apps themselves. Last year, over 94 billion apps were downloaded globally from our Play app store; browsers such as Opera Mini and Firefox have been downloaded more than 100 million times, UC Browser more than 500 million times. This is in stark contrast to how things used to be in the 1990s and early 2000s\u2014the dial-up age. Back then, changing the pre-installed applications on your computer, or adding new ones, was technically difficult and time-consuming. The Commission\u2019s Android decision ignores the new breadth of choice and clear evidence about how people use their phones today. Here\u2019s the full statement. The EC have created this graphic to explain how Google has been unfairly keeping a grip on its Android operating system, hurting rival search engine and browser makers. The French government has welcomed the EC\u2019s move. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told reporters in Paris that it was a \u2018excellent decision\u2019, adding: \u201cNo-one is above the laws that have been laid down in common for all....Not Google, nor any other entity.\u201d US tech entrepreneur Jason Kint has calculated that the EC has basically fined Google 4% of its annual revenues. That happens to be the maximum penalty available under Europe\u2019s new data privacy rules (even though this isn\u2019t a data violation). Here\u2019s a video clip of Margrethe Vestager denying she has a vendetta against America during today\u2019s press conference: Our news story about Google\u2019s record fine for breaking Europe\u2019s competition rules is now live. Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin writes: Google has been hit with a record \u20ac4.34bn (\u00a33.8bn) fine by the European Union for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The EU imposed the multibillion-euro penalty after finding that the US tech firm required smartphone manufacturers to pre-instal Google\u2019s search and browser apps devices using its Android operating system, otherwise they would not be allowed to use its Google Play online store and streaming service. Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, said Google has used its Android mobile phone operating system \u201cto cement its dominance as a search engine\u201d, preventing rivals from innovating and competing \u201cand this is illegal under EU antitrust rules\u201d. Vestager added: \u201cThe vast majority of users simply take what comes with their device and don\u2019t download competing apps. \u201cOr to slightly paraphrase what [US free market economist] Milton Friedman has said \u2018there ain\u2019t no such thing as a free search.\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s Jennifer\u2019s story: Today\u2019s ruling comes too late to affect the mobile phone market, my colleague Sam Gibbs says: Here\u2019s a flavour of his analysis: The EC is demanding that Google cede some control over Android in its licensing. The EC is demanding that manufacturers should be free to use Android and include the Google Play Store without having to pre-install the Google Search app and Chrome. It\u2019s a similar strategy to that employed by the EC in 2004, when it forced Microsoft to release a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and later offer a browser choice screen, which allowed users to select a web browser other than Internet Explorer. But as with the Media Player-free version of Windows, Windows XP N, for which there was no demand, consumers are unlikely to buy a version of Android without Google\u2019s services. \u201cThe EU\u2019s stance is arguably six to eight years too late,\u201d said Geoff Blaber from analyst firm CCS Insight. \u201cAndroid has already helped establish Google apps and services as essentials for consumers in the western world. More here: Q: Why does Google get fined in Europe, but not in the US and Canada? Commissioner Vestager insists that the EC has been fair - it has investigated complaints and taken evidence in order to reach its decisions. Q: Was today\u2019s decision really taken outside the context of the political situation? [a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the EU\u2019s trade policies, and threats to impose tariffs on European exports, I think] People more insightful than me say that the world is becoming more and more unpredictable, Vestager replies. That means it\u2019s important to do predictable things -- so if you breach antitrust rules you pay the penalty, she adds. The press conference is now over. Q: Currently, the mobile phone operating system is dominated either by Android or Apple. Do you really think that is going to change? Commissioner Vestager says she isn\u2019t going to guess how the mobile sector will develop. But she insists that competition will develop, if the market is fair. She says that Amazon developed a fork which they were very keen to roll out to manufacturers, but \u201cit wasn\u2019t possible because of Google\u2019s illegal restrictions\u201d. Q: This is the biggest fine ever for antitrust violations, so is Google guilty of the biggest ever antitrust breach? Vestager jokes that she loves all her children equally, so it\u2019s not fair to make her choose which company has been the worst sinner against competition in the EU. Q: Wouldn\u2019t breaking up Google address these antitrust concerns? Vestager denies that breaking up a company would be a \u2018silver bullet\u2019 to deliver competition. Q: Was Donald Trump right when he told Jean-Claude Juncker last week that \u201cYour tax lady really hates the US\u201d? Vestager says she has fact-checked this statement. It\u2019s true that she\u2019s a woman, and that she deals with tax. But after that point, the US president\u2019s claim becomes less accurate. \u201cI very much like the US\u201d, Vestager insists, pointing out that she\u2019s from Denmark, where people often have American friends and appreciate US culture and travel. Q: Why is today\u2019s fine twice as big as the one imposed on Google in 2017? The fine reflects the scale of Google\u2019s \u201cvery serious illegal behaviour\u201d, Vestager replies. Q: Do you think Google needs to be broken up to improve competition? Vestager says she doesn\u2019t know whether that would improve the situation. The EC really wants Google to allow proper competition at the mobile phone operating system level. Q: Does the length of time these cases take limit their impact, as the market has moved on by the time the EU acts? Vestager says that the case began in 2015, following a number of complaints. The EC sticks to \u2018due process\u2019, which limits how fast these cases can be wrapped up, she explains. Q: What remedies will be available to existing Android phone users? Could Google be forced to send out a notification to customers, telling them they can change their search engine or browser? Vestager says the EC is making a classical \u2018cease and desist\u2019 decision. It\u2019s now up to Google to decide how to make amends in the future. [I think that means that existing Android users won\u2019t see any difference on their handset] Q: Google now has an entrenched position in the mobile sector (with four-fifths of devices), so how can you enforce changes now? Vestager says Google needs to take away the contractual restrictions that have held back competition on Android. Q: Did you examine whether Google blocked rivals from collecting data on Android users? Vestager says that rival search engines \u201cnever really\u201d got a foothold on Android, due to Google\u2019s restrictions (ie, the company didn\u2019t have to actively block its rivals, as they weren\u2019t there in the first place). Q: Could your decision drive up the cost of mobile phone handsets? Vestager says there are still various ways in which Google can monetising the Android operating system, rather than simply hiking prices. Q: What will happen to the money (assuming Google pays up). Vestager says that the fine will be returned to EU member states, based on how much each country pays into the EU budget. But that could take a while, if Google files an appeal. Commissioner Vestager is taking questions about the Google fine now. Q: Could this decision affect next week\u2019s meeting between EC president Juncker and US president Trump? Vestager says that the US competition authorities want fair competition, just as Europe does. As such, they expect the EC to do its job. Q: Should Google apologise? We want Google to end its illegal behaviour, Vestager replies. This isn\u2019t a moral endeavour - we just want Google to play by the rules. The size of Google\u2019s fine reflects the \u201cseriousness\u201d and sustained natures of its violation of the EC\u2019s antitrust rules, commissioner Margrethe Vestager tells reporters in Brussels. The company must end its \u2018illegal conduct\u2019 within 90 days, by ending the restrictions it has imposed on mobile phone makers (as outlined here), Vestager explains. Our decision stops Google from controlling which search and browser apps manufacturers can install, or which android operating system they can use, she says. And if Google doesn\u2019t comply, its parent company Alphabet could be fined up to 5% of its daily turnover each day. Newsflash: Google says it will appeal against the EC\u2019s fine. Google spokesman Al Verney argues that its Android operating system [which is used on 80% of phones worldwide] has been good for consumers. Verney says: Android has created more choice for everyone, not less. A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust consequences. We will appeal the Commission\u2019s decision. The EC says that Google has been abusing its market position for seven years. Today\u2019s ruling states: Google has prevented device manufacturers from using any alternative version of Android that was not approved by Google (Android forks). In order to be able to pre-install on their devices Google\u2019s proprietary apps, including the Play Store and Google Search, manufacturers had to commit not to develop or sell even a single device running on an Android fork. The Commission found that this conduct was abusive as of 2011, which is the date Google became dominant in the market for app stores for the Android mobile operating system. Commissioner Vestager is now outlining how Google restricts manufacturers from creating rival \u2018forks\u2019 of its Android operating system. In theory, a manufacturer can used the Android source code to create their own platform, as Google makes it openly accessible. But in practice, Vestager says, device manufacturers who wish to obtain Google\u2019s proprietary Android apps and services need to enter into contracts with Google, as part of which Google imposes a number of restrictions. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager adds: Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement its dominance as a search engine. These practices have denied rivals a chance to innovate and to compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefit of effective competition in the very important mobile sphere. And this is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Vestager is outlining the case against Google. She says: Google required manufacturers to pre-install the Google search and browser apps on Android phones, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to use Google Play (its app service)/. Google paid manufacturers and network operators to make sure that only the Google search app was installed on devices Google has restricted the development of competing mobile phone operating systems, which could have provided a platform for rival search engines. Commissioner Vestager says Google must make amends within 90 days, or the company will incur penalty payments. NEWSFLASH: The European Commission has fined Google \u20ac4.34bn for breaching EU antitrust rules. The tech giant is being sanctioned for abusing its dominant position in the Android operating system for mobile phones. The EC says Google unfairly took advantage of the popularity of its Android mobile phone operating system, and forced phonemakers to pre-install Google services such as its flagship search product. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is outlining the decision now. More to follow! Margrethe Vestager, the EC\u2019s Competition Commissioner for Competition, is about to give a press conference in Brussels. Presumably this is to announce the Google fine. It will be streamed online here. Over in Brussels, antitrust regulators are preparing to hit Google with a multi-billion euro fine. My colleague Jennifer Rankin explains: Google could be hit with a record fine by the European Union\u2019s competition authorities on Wednesday for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The company risks a multibillion-euro penalty for making the Google search engine the default on most phones using its Android operating system. Citing people familiar with the case, the Financial Times reported that the fine is likely to exceed the \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) penalty imposed by the European commission in 2017 when Google was found to have used its dominant search engine to build its internet shopping service. Google is appealing against that decision. The EU regulator could fine Google up to 10% of its turnover, or some \u20ac11bn. Reuters is reporting that Google could be fined around \u20ac4.3bn, or $5bn. The decision could be just minutes away.... Britain\u2019s retail sector has suffered another blow \u2013 meaty restaurant chain Gaucho is expected to file for administration today. The move will threaten around 1,500 jobs, adding to the thousands being cut at high street chains such as House of Fraser, Poundworld, Marks &amp; Spencer and Mothercare. UK house price inflation has hit a five-year low. House prices across the UK rose by 3.0% in the year to May, which is the slowest growth since August 2013. Once again, falling house prices in London dragged the national average down. The Office for National Statistics explains: The lowest annual growth was in London, where prices decreased by 0.4% over the year. London has shown a general slowdown in its annual growth rate since mid-2016. This is the fourth consecutive month that London house prices have fallen over the year. Political uncertainty (ie Brexit) is hurting prices in the capital, says Guy Bradshaw, Director of Central London Sales and Lettings at UK Sotheby\u2019s International Realty: \u201cAs annual growth in the UK has continued to decline to the lowest rate we have seen since August 2013, it is unsurprising to see the London market has also followed suit. We were never expecting to see a particularly buoyant market this year, with political uncertainty and stamp duty continuing to dampen sales. The \u2018Spring Bounce\u2019 is undeniably modest in comparison to previous years and whilst this may be due to the poor weather we encountered late into the year this may very well be setting the scene for the summer market. Here\u2019s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u2019s inflation figures: The chances of a rise in interest rates in August have dipped after British inflation remained at a one-year low last month. Confounding expectations for the return of higher rates of inflation in June fuelled by the rising price of petrol, the Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index remained unchanged at 2.4% from the previous month. Although the cost of gas and electricity prices increased and the price at the pump hit the highest level for nearly four years, consumers benefited from the falling cost of computer games and the summer clothing sales. House prices across the UK also rose at the slowest pace in nearly five years. Faced with falling wage growth, the latest snapshot from the ONS poses the Bank of England with limited grounds for raising interest rates next month. Sterling slid to a 10-month low against the dollar on foreign exchanges after the data was released. More here: The Resolution Foundation has warned that inflation could overtake earnings growth soon, which would mean real wages would start falling again: Here\u2019s the government\u2019s response to today\u2019s inflation data, from Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General, Mel Stride: \u201cInflation has fallen from its peak last year but we recognise the cost of living is still a challenge for some families. That is why we are freezing fuel duty saving drivers \u00a3160 a year, cutting income taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage to \u00a37.83 an hour.\u201d The pound is acting more like the \u2018Great British Peso\u2019 right now, as it is buffeted by political tensions as well as economic data. So says Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, who believes sterling is behaving increasingly like an emerging market currency. Hordijk explains: \u201cAs the dust settles on yesterday\u2019s \u2018Wild West\u2019 style standoff in Parliament, UK macroeconomic data comes back into the spotlight ahead of the Bank of England rate decision in August..... Sterling\u2019s knee jerk reaction [to the inflation data], carving lows not seen since September 2017, evidences how over-inflated expectations were on the Bank of England\u2019s upcoming decision. Today\u2019s soft inflation reading will do little to knock the Bank of England off of their implied course, but tail risk of the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 resurfacing has increased. Sterling looks to be in for a bleak day, especially as Theresa May will have to fend off grilling during today\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.\u201d Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool predicts that the Bank of England will hike borrowing next month, even though inflationary pressures are less intense than feared. He thinks the BoE will be keen to get an interest rate rise through before Brexit becomes even more tense. Despite inflation getting stuck at 2.4%, I sense that early August is a very convenient time for the MPC members to hike. Why? UK inflation, at 2.4% in the second quarter of 2018, is fully in line with their 2.43% forecast recorded in the May Inflation report. So no surprises there. This, together with the widespread expectation that GDP growth in 2018 Q2 will be higher than the previous quarter figure will encourage MPC members to raise the policy rate. At the same time, with the Parliament moving in recess in less than a week\u2019s time, May\u2019s government will get a much needed \u2018breathing space\u2019 in terms of Brexit-related tensions. All this implies a very short \u2018time window of opportunity\u2019 for MPC members to hike in August rather than kicking the \u2018interest-rate can\u2019 down the road. Inflation is still taking a big chunk out of UK workers\u2019 pay cheques. At 2.4% in June, consumer prices are rising nearly as fast as earnings, meaning real wages are only up around 0.3%. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, explains: \u201dUK CPI inflation remains steady at 2.4%, but it is still above the 2% target and is likely to be stuck close to 2.5% over the summer. The gap between wage growth (2.7%) and inflation remains narrow - just 0.3%. So consumers are likely to remain cautious while their living standards are still rising very slowly. Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, warns that wages are unlikely to rise sharply this year. \u201cThe unchanged inflation rate offers some reprieve for households at a time when wage growth remains uninspiring. \u201cDespite higher utility bills and petrol costs, consumers may have benefitted from offsetting seasonal discounts, particularly on clothing. The good news should however be taken with a pinch of salt. With the recent weak performance in pay packets, and high street bargains only temporary, the cost of living still remains high. \u201cThe stickiness in prices will reduce pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates in August. The decision is certainly not set in stone, particularly as wage growth is a key component of inflation, and the recent data shows little promise of a sustained rise in salaries.\u201d UK inflation is still over the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%, meaning prices are rising much faster than the saving rates on offer from the banks. Kate Smith, head of pensions at life insurance firm Aegon, says household budgets are still being squeezed. \u201cFinancial pressure created by rising prices will continue to hit people on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, the hardest. As people live longer, with more years spent in retirement, it\u2019s vital they protect their savings from the erosive effects of inflation. Even at relatively low levels of inflation the spending power of \u00a3100 in today\u2019s money could be halved in 20 years\u2019 time. June\u2019s unchanged inflation rate is a huge surprise, says Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. Inflation had been expected to bounce back up to 2.6% or even 2.7% on the back of higher fuel and energy prices. While these came through, they were offset by falling prices for clothes and games. Inflation remained at 2.4% for the third month in a row. Faster rising prices would have given the Bank of England cover for an interest rate hike next month. Now it looks odds-on that the MPC will hold fire yet again. That\u2019s particularly the case after yesterday\u2019s wage growth data emerged weaker than expected at 2.5% including bonuses. Stevenson suspects that the Bank of England will hold off raising interest rates until November, or maybe until 2019.... Economist Philip Shaw of City firm Investec says the pound is suffering from \u2018political trauma\u2019, as well as today\u2019s weaker-than-expected inflation data. Jamie McGeever of Reuters predicts that sterling could fall through the $1.30 mark (which would be a new 10-month low) Simon French of Panmure Gordon says that an August interest rate rise looks less likely, especially after UK wage growth slowed to a six-month low yesterday. The pound has hit its lowest level in 10 months, as traders react to this morning\u2019s unexpectedly weak inflation data. Sterling has dropped to $1.3011, its weakest level since September 2017. The City is calculating that an August interest rate rise is now less likely, as there is less sign that inflationary pressures are building. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the \u201cpolitical shenanigans in Westminster\u201d are also weighing on the pound, following last night\u2019s narrow victory for Theresa May over her customs plan (see earlier post). This chart shows how Britain\u2019s household heating bills, and petrol costs, drove the cost of living up last month. Clothing, toys and computer games got cheaper, though, meaning inflation was flat month-on-month (rising by 2.4% year-on-year). Men\u2019s clothing prices fell sharply last month, also helped to keep inflation pegged last month. The ONS says: Prices of clothing fell by 2.3% between May and June this year compared with a fall of 1.1% between the same two months a year ago. Prices usually fall between May and June as the summer sales season begins, but the fall in 2018 is the largest since 2012. The effect came mainly from men\u2019s clothing. The Office for National Statistics says that recreation got cheaper last month, making up for more expensive energy and fuel. Rising prices for motor fuels and domestic gas and electricity produced the largest upward contributions to change in the rate between May and June 2018. Falling prices for clothing and games, toys and hobbies provided the largest downward effects. At just 2.4%, UK inflation remains at its joint-lowest level in 14 months. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s inflation rate remained at 2.4% in June, defying expectations that it would rise to 2.6%. That\u2019s good news for households, given the slowdown in wage growth in the last quarter. It also takes some pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month. More to follow! UK engineering group Smiths is having a bad morning. Smiths shares are down 7%, after it told the City that some of its medical products have lost certification under the EU\u2019s new Medical Device Regulations. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points in early trading, partly thanks to easyJet. The budget airline\u2019s shares have jumped by 3%, after it reported a 14% jump in revenues in the last quarter and also raised its profit forecast. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says easyJet is benefiting from falling competition: The demise of competitors such as Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia has opened up the field, ancillary revenue has increased due to a change in passenger behaviour (increasingly paying for additional baggage and allocated seating) and load factors remain high. European stock markets have hit a one-month high this morning, led by technology stocks. The Stoxx 600 has risen by 0.6% today, with the tech sector gaining over 2%. Semiconductor firm ASML and telecoms equipment maker Ericsson are leading the rally, after both beating analyst forecasts this morning. That follows a solid day in Wall Street yesterday, where the Nasdaq hit another record high. With Amazon hitting new peaks, and Netflix recovering from disappointing results earlier this week, the tech boom doesn\u2019t appear to have ended yet. The pound has dipped below $1.31 against the US dollar this morning, close to its lowest level of 2018. Sterling slumped yesterday when the unemployment figures showed wages growth slowing, potentially making an August interest rate rise less likely. The pound is also being dragged down by Brexit anxiety, after prime minister Theresa May was forced to threaten her own MPs with a general election to force them to back her Brexit plan. Although May won a crucial vote on the customs union last night, she lost on a separate amendment which demanded that the UK remained under EU medicines regulation after leaving the bloc. Given the PM\u2019s precarious position, City investors aren\u2019t convinced that May can drive her plans through the Commons. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank says the PM\u2019s challenge is \u201cLike herding cats\u201d. Once again, the Brexiteers have laid bare how difficult it is for UK Prime Minister Theresa May to hold her Conservative government together. Although May had turned her plan for a semi-soft Brexit into the official line of her Cabinet last week, causing prominent dissenters to quit, Brexiteers led by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg forced her on Monday to accept an amendment that would make it even more difficult for the EU to endorse her proposed customs arrangement. The strongly pro-EU House of Lords will probably reject the amendment. After the House of Commons barely passed it anyway (305 for, 302 against), the amendment may not survive a second vote. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain may be facing a new cost of living squeeze. Inflation figures due out this morning are expected to show that prices rose at a faster rate in June, hitting consumers in the pocket. Economists predict that the consumer prices index rose by around 2.6% in June, up from 2.4% in May, partly due to rising energy prices. Sue Trinh of Royal Bank of Canada says: The rise in petrol prices in June should ensure that the transport category continued to make a strong positive contribution to UK inflation. Added to that, a number of pre-announced utility price increases kicked in last month, including a 5.5% rise from the largest energy provider British Gas which came into effect at the end of May. This comes as UK wage growth slows. Yesterday we learned that basic pay only rose by 2.7% in the three months to May, the weakest in six months. If you include bonuses, then total earnings only rose by 2.5%. Today\u2019s inflation figures will help to influence whether the Bank of England feels confident enough to raise interest rates next month. If prices are rising faster, then the hawks at the BoE will push for borrowing costs to be hiked. But dovish colleagues may worry that wage growth isn\u2019t strong enough. It\u2019s also inflation day in the eurozone. Consumer prices in the euro area are expected to have risen by 2% in the last year, up from 1.9% in May. Also coming up today Google is bracing for a record fine from the European Commission today, over claims it has abused its dominant position in the mobile phone operating system market. America\u2019s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is returning to Capitol Hill later for a second day of questioning. Yesterday he told senators that the US economy was growing strongly, adding: \u201cThe unemployment rate is low and expected to fall further. Americans who want jobs have a good chance of finding them.\u201d The agenda 9.30am BST: UK inflation date for June 9.30am BST: UK house price data for May 10am BST: Eurozone inflation data for June 3pm BST: Fed chair Jerome Powell testifying to the US House of Representatives",

Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high...</p> <p>These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike. The market expectations of a rate hike slipped to 72% from 77% prior to the release.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T15:52:51.273Z\">at 4.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f53cae4b0a426f7db4b53\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T14:51:33.877Z\">3.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Google, and Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a way Google has become a victim of its own success in terms of its search and marketing capabilities, with little in the way of alternative search and browser options available.

The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon\u2019s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn\u2019t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.)</p> <p>In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f41a1e4b0afc5fe5824da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T13:39:44.912Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000119312518220240/d552608d8k.htm\">a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</a></p> <p>Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f3f76e4b0a426f7db4a14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T13:25:20.527Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "EasyJet has raised its profits forecast after soaring revenues in the spring, despite air traffic control strikes and the unusually hot weather dampening demand. Johan Lundgren, the airline\u2019s chief executive, said costs from disruption had grown by \u00a325m compared with the same period in 2017. Air traffic control strikes meant more than 2,600 flights were cancelled and left easyJet having to find 70,000 hotel rooms for stranded passengers. Lundgren said easyJet would make a legal complaint to the European commission as it and other airlines, including IAG and Ryanair, seek a solution to the strikes, which are primarily French-based but affect overflying routes. EasyJet revenues nonetheless grew 14% to \u00a31.6bn in the third quarter to 30 June, with ancillary revenues such as baggage up 21.1% to \u00a3328m, as it flew almost 10% more passengers. Lundgren said the heatwave and World Cup had dampened demand and would have an effect on the summer season. \u201cWe have taken into consideration slightly weaker late yields, for the quarter to come.\u201d However, the airline said it anticipated higher annual profits of \u00a3550m-\u00a3590m, as it unveiled the first in a fleet of bigger, quieter planes from Airbus. Lundgren said the A321neo would help easyJet\u2019s growth at airports where noise and capacity is an issue, such as Heathrow. The plane can carry 49 more passengers than the A320, its previous largest plane, and the airline has converted an order for 30 A320s to the larger model. Airbus claims the A321neo is 50% quieter on takeoff and landing, and 15% more fuel efficient, than previous generations of the plane. Lundgren said: \u201cWhat it allows us to do is grow at airports that are slot-constrained.\u201d That includes London Gatwick, where easyJet is the biggest airline, but also Heathrow, where it hopes to operate after the building of its third runway, which parliament voted to approve last month. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, who was aboard the first flight of easyJet\u2019s A321neo from Gatwick to the Farnborough airshow, said: \u201cThis aircraft is typical of what\u2019s going to allow aviation to continue growing, and become more environmentally and community friendly: it uses less fuel, makes less noise and carries more people.\u201d Speaking at Farnborough, the Airbus chief executive, Tom Enders, said the delivery of the plane was a \u201cnew chapter \u2026 I\u2019m sure it will accelerate easyJet\u2019s growth.\u201d He said the outlook remained strong for aerospace despite \u201call the political headwinds and craziness that happens in the world\u201d. Enders said the week\u2019s parliamentary turmoil over Brexit had reinforced Airbus\u2019s resolve to take contingency measures. He said: \u201cI thought that Chequers was going in the right direction and now we see that unravelling again so all the more reason for us to take serious decisions \u2026 preparing to cope with this.\u201d He added: \u201cOur major concern is in the area of what it does to our just-in-time logistical chains \u2013 this is why we are very worried, why we are now activating contingency plans, to create some buffers on inventory, to at least be able for a certain period after the exit happens to mitigate the effects of that.\u201d Enders said curtailing freedom of movement was another major worry for Airbus, with 80,000-90,000 journeys taken by the company\u2019s staff alone between Britain and Europe each year.",

    "webTitle": "Why Brexit is 'no big deal' for BAE Systems | Angela Monaghan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "While Rolls-Royce and Airbus used this week\u2019s Farnborough International Airshow to warn of the dire consequences of a hard Brexit, Britain\u2019s biggest defence firm, BAE Systems, simply shrugged its shoulders. The business is Britain\u2019s biggest manufacturing employer, with 34,000 staff and sales of nearly \u00a320bn last year. But Brexit? \u201cIt\u2019s just not that big a deal [for us],\u201d reckons the firm that makes everything from ammunition to combat aircraft and submarines. Its statement is wildly at odds with other major firms operating in the industrial world. The European plane maker Airbus is already stockpiling parts in preparation for a no-deal Brexit, and the aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce admitted this week that it is making plans to do the same. Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, has warned that \u00a380bn of planned UK investment over the next five years would be at risk if Britain struck a bad Brexit deal. Meanwhile the wider UK car industry has been sounding the alarm on Brexit since well before the referendum. Not so at BAE, which says frictionless trade once the UK has left the EU would be a good thing but has otherwise kept fairly quiet despite its dominant position. There are a couple of key reasons for the apparent nonchalance: first, BAE is predominantly a UK-US company. It has little direct trade with countries in the EU, despite earnings from sales abroad totalling \u00a34.7bn. Second, it is a low-volume producer of high-value defence kit, unlike the car companies which are high-volume manufacturers heavily reliant on just-in-time delivery of parts where holdups of just a few hours at customs could seriously disrupt production schedules. The average UK-built car has about 6,000 parts, the majority of which come from the EU, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Parts can pass back and forth across the Channel several times for various processes before reaching the UK. At Airbus\u2019s factory in Broughton, north Wales, wings are built for all commercial aircraft before being transported to other Airbus factories outside the UK, including its headquarters in Toulouse, France. \u201cAs we have relatively limited trade with the EU, the resulting impact of Brexit on our business is likely to be limited, depending on the terms of any transition and final agreements,\u201d a spokeswoman for BAE said. \u201cHowever, we, like all businesses, want to see progress in the negotiations between the government and the European commission to give us all certainty,\u201d she added. BAE employs 83,200 people globally, mainly in four hubs, the only one inside the EU being the UK. In the UK it employs 34,300 people and it has no factories elsewhere in Europe. The other three hubs are in Saudi Arabia , Australia and the US \u2013 where it employs 29,100 people and which accounts for about 40% of overall business. When BAE won a \u00a320bn contract last month to build Australia\u2019s fleet of new navy frigates, it was seized upon by Theresa May as an example of how the UK might now build on its close relationships with allies such as Australia. But the nine new Hunter class shipswill be built in Adelaide and the 4,000 new jobs created to build the vessels will be in Australia. Even the Eurofighter Typhoon \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest collaborative defence programme \u2013 is basically Brexit-proof. BAE is a consortium member alongside Leonardo and a division of Airbus, and the programme is a four-partner nation deal between Germany, Spain, Italy and UK. It is therefore outside the EU. George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while it would not be right to say Brexit poses absolutely zero threat to BAE, it is clearly a lot less threatened than others. \u201cThere\u2019s a simple reason BAE is not forecasting the same level of disruption as others. Its main customers are the US, Saudi Arabia and the UK, with Europe only responsible for 8% of its revenues last year. \u201cOn the other hand, Rolls-Royce depends on European nations for over 18% of its sales. Combine that with the comments that have come out of Airbus, a big customer of Rolls, and it\u2019s easy to see why the group would be monitoring the progress of the Brexit negotiations with interest.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Shareholders are more concerned about environmental issues than promoting women to senior positions in boardrooms and some are not convinced that businesses need more women in top jobs, company executives have told MPs. At a hearing on women in executive management, the House of Commons\u2019 women and equalities committee quizzed representatives from the water company Severn Trent, packaging company Smurfit Kappa, car parts and bike retailer Halfords, the infrastructure firm Stobart Group and housebuilder Persimmon. All said investors asked more questions about the environment and sustainability than how to get more women into boardrooms. Sarah Bentley, the chief customer officer at Severn Trent, whose chief executive is Liv Garfield \u2013 one of only six female FTSE 100 CEOs \u2013 said some shareholders had yet to be convinced of the benefits of having more women in executive roles. Bentley said a number of investors recognised that having a more diverse executive team added value, but said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s true of all of our investors.\u201d She added: \u201cObviously investors care about the performance of the business ... We\u2019ve obviously got quite a lot of female talent. They want to make sure that we\u2019ve got the right quality and calibre of talent.\u201d Jonathan Crookall, the people director at Halfords, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a growing topic but it\u2019s not at the top of the agenda yet.\u201d Analysis from Cranfield University this week showed a sharp drop in the number of women holding the most senior jobs at FTSE 250 firms, and static numbers at FTSE 100 companies. There are only six female CEOs in the FTSE 250 and the number of all-male boards has risen to 10. Several of the executives stressed the importance of mentoring, and Bentley revealed she was receiving mentoring to prepare for a CEO role. In a pointed exchange, the Conservative chair of the committee, Maria Miller, asked Gianluca Castellini, the vice-president of HR at Smurfit Kappa, why the firm was taking so long to find two more women to sit on its 12-strong board \u2013 out of a workforce of 46,000 \u2013 to meet the target of 33% women on its board by 2020 set by the government-backed Alexander-Hampton review. Castellini replied that \u201ceverything must be based on meritocracy\u201d. Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, said in reality appointments were often not based on meritocracy and that \u201cthe systems in place are skewed towards one type of people, usually men\u201d. Stobart Group is one of 10 FTSE 250 firms with all-male boards. Kate Willard, its head of corporate projects, told MPs the company was in the process of rectifying this as it recruits a new chair, chief financial officer and two non-executive directors. Richard Latham, the HR director of Persimmon, defended the housebuilder\u2019s record on female appointments, despite the lack of female executive directors on its board. He said 83% of the company\u2019s sales team was female, and 40% of designers and planners.",

      "bodyText": "The Premier Foods chief executive, Gavin Darby, said he would stay on as the head of the Mr Kipling owner despite facing a 41% protest vote against his re-election by shareholders. Speaking after a stormy annual general meeting where the activist shareholder Oasis Management called on Darby to step down regardless of the outcome of the vote, the chairman, Keith Hamill, said Premier\u2019s board backed the chief executive and that decision had been accepted by a majority of shareholders. Hamill said it would be wrong to ignore the views of nearly 60% of investors to back Darby. \u201cWe intend to continue to listen and have discussions with shareholders, including those whose support we don\u2019t have,\u201d he said. Oasis, which last week temporarily doubled its stake in the company to 17.3% after borrowing shares from other investors, accuses Darby, a former Coca-Cola and Vodafone executive, of \u201cpersistent value destruction\u201d during his five-year tenure. It claims Premier is in a \u201czombie-like state\u201d because of his failure to drive growth. Paulson &amp; Co, which controls a 6% stake in Premier, has sided with Oasis but the top shareholder, Nissin Foods, which owns a 20% stake, backed Darby. At the meeting, Premier\u2019s board came under fire over executive pay, the way it had accounted for its debts, and the failure to raise its share price above a putative bid of 65p a share from the US firm McCormick in 2016. About a quarter of proxy votes were also posted against the re-election of nearly all Premier\u2019s directors, and its remuneration report. Oasis criticised the board for a sudden \u201cchange of posture\u201d after Hamill and Darby made clear in comments to the media just ahead of the meeting that the company would be happy to consider offers for all or part of the company. Hamill told shareholders there had been no change in strategy. \u201cThe primary strategy of the company is to improve performance and reduce debt but the board has also said that in parallel with that we will be looking at ways to see if it\u2019s possible to release some of the financial pressure,\u201d he said. However, he added: \u201cWe are not in the business of selling things we can grow without getting good value for them.\u201d A spokesperson for Oasis said: \u201cA majority of Premier Foods\u2019 top independent public equity shareholders have voted against the re-election of Gavin Darby. \u201cHe has been saved by what we consider to be his cosy relationship with conflicted shareholder Nissin Foods, reminiscent of what happened in 2016 with the McCormick takeover approach. \u201cThe message from today\u2019s huge negative vote could not be clearer \u2013 Gavin Darby has no credibility and he should step down immediately. If he is unwilling to resign, we urge the other directors to discharge their duties and act in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole to remove him.\u201d At a bad-tempered meeting that journalists were allowed to watch only via a live feed from an adjoining room, Oasis\u2019s criticisms of Darby were taken up by a former non-executive director of Premier Foods. Charles Miller Smith, a former Unilever executive who stepped down from Premier\u2019s board in 2015, said he had helped appoint Darby but now believed \u201cit\u2019s time to bow out\u201d as Darby lacked \u201cleadership skills\u201d and \u201cany sense of strategic change\u201d. Premier\u2019s former chair David Beever, who left last November, defended Darby, saying he was \u201cprobably the best chief executive I have ever worked with\u201d. \u201cLegitimate frustration is no excuse for sloppy analysis, for bad judgment and flawed proposals,\u201d he said. Beever told the meeting how a putative 65p a share bid from McCormick, the US flavourings firm, in 2016 had never been firmed up. He said that after checking over Premier\u2019s books, the chairman of the Schwartz herbs and spices owner told him there would be no bid \u201cat any price\u201d because of a regulatory issue with the group\u2019s pension scheme. \u201cThe criticism of Gavin Darby for walking away from a bid is completely wrong,\u201d Beever said.",

      "bodyText": "The restaurant group Gaucho is preparing to file for administration, putting 1,500 jobs at risk. The owner of the Gaucho and Cau brands is the latest victim of the intense pressure on the high street, which has cost 35,000 jobs in the retail and casual dining sectors this year. The group filed a notice of intent to appoint Deloitte as administrator on Wednesday, a legal process which gives the company 10 days protection from creditors, as first reported by Sky News. The Argentine-themed restaurant group had been in last-ditch talks with potential buyers understood to include Hugh Osmond, the former Pizza Express backer, Gaucho\u2019s existing management team backed by Core Capital, part of the private equity firm ESO Capital, as well as by Limerston Capital, an investor in companies including Spark Energy. Martin Williams, Gaucho\u2019s former managing director who now runs the M restaurant chain also put forward a bid. Gaucho had considered an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement, under which it hoped to close its 22 Cau outlets, which employ 700 people, but continue operating the more successful 16 Gaucho-branded restaurants, which employ 800 staff. But the business ran into crisis when it faced a tax bill of more than \u00a31m which was due to be paid on Friday. The company also owes \u00a350m to its banks. Gaucho is expected to fall into administration unless a buyer can be found within the next 10 days. It is possible that all of the Gaucho restaurants could be salvaged from administration, with the Cau restaurants closed for good. Cau, which serves burgers, steak dinners and brunch with a Buenos Aires theme, has suffered sales fall in double digits for more than a year amid heavy competition and a squeeze on consumer spending. A spokesman for Gaucho said: \u201cDespite an extensive process which attracted proposals from a number of parties, it is with regret that, due to the complexities of the group\u2019s legal structure, ongoing underperformance at Cau and the level of indebtedness, the directors have been unable to find an agreed, solvent solution.\u201d Gaucho is the latest in a string of high street dining and retail chains to run into trouble. Prezzo, Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian are among the restaurant brands to have shut outlets and culled hundreds of jobs. Restaurants and retailers are being squeezed amid rising business rates and minimum wage costs as well as a slowdown in consumer spending as inflation, especially on food prices, has outstripped wage rises. Julie Palmer, a partner at insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor, said sit-down eateries had suffered further in recent weeks as the hot weather and the World Cup had shifted spending towards pubs or eating and drinking at home. \u201cThe sector has had a torrid time with wage and rent inflation taking a bite out of thin margins combined with high levels of competition for squeezed consumer spending,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cThe recent consumer shift from spending in the casual dining sector to wet-led pubs, takeaway restaurants and supermarkets as the UK sat down to enjoy the World Cup has further compounded the challenges facing the sector.\u201d The number of restaurants in the UK fell for the first time in eight years in the year to the end of March as a private equity-fuelled bubble of expansion came to an end. On average, two restaurants a week closed over the year, including casual dining chains, upmarket restaurants and independent establishments, according to data from analysts CGA and corporate advisory firm AlixPartners. The private equity firm Equistone bought the Gaucho group in January 2016 having backed a management buyout in 2005. In January, it hired Oliver Meakin, the former boss of the electronics store Maplin, which fell into administration in February. A spokesperson for Equistone said: \u201cEquistone has been a supportive majority shareholder to Gaucho Group since its investment in 2016, working closely with the company to address the challenges presented by the adverse trading conditions that have negatively impacted the UK casual dining sector as a whole. \u201cDespite Equistone having presented Gaucho\u2019s lenders with, and committed to funding, a business plan that would have maintained the company as a going concern, we understand that a notice of intention to appoint administrators has been submitted.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chances of a rise in interest rates in August have dipped after British inflation remained at a one-year low last month, triggered by the summer sales. Confounding expectations for the return of higher rates of inflation in June fuelled by the rising price of petrol, the Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index remained unchanged at 2.4% from the previous month. Although the cost of gas and electricity increased and the price at the pump hit the highest level for nearly four years, consumers were given relief from the falling cost of computer games and the summer clothing sales. House prices across the UK also rose at the slowest pace in nearly five years. While also faced with falling wage growth, the latest snapshot from the ONS presents the Bank of England with limited grounds for raising interest rates from as early as next month. Sterling slid to a 10-month low against the dollar on foreign exchanges after the data was released. Threadneedle Street may still be able to point towards recovering economic growth across the UK in recent months, although subdued levels of inflation and weak wage growth remove some of the impetus for raising the cost of borrowing. The Bank has a target of 2% for inflation set by the government. Although still above target, economists said the measure for the cost of living was gradually falling back from its peak of 3.1% in November as the lingering effects of the Brexit vote begin to fade. Observers said there could, however, be rising inflation ahead as manufacturers raise their prices. Tej Parikh, a senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cThe good news should, however, be taken with a pinch of salt. With the recent weak performance in pay packets, and high-street bargains only temporary, the cost of living still remains high.\u201d Official figures published on Tuesday showed the rate of wage growth in Britain fell to the lowest level in six months, hovering just above the rate of inflation at 2.5% in the three months to May. Mel Stride MP, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said the government recognised that households were coming under pressure and had frozen the rate of fuel duty and raised the minimum wage. The ONS found the falling price of men\u2019s clothing among the main factors offsetting the rise in petrol prices, which have been driven higher in recent months by a higher global oil price. Statisticians said the monthly drop in clothing costs in June was the biggest recorded since 2012 as shops staged their summer sales amid deep gloom on the high street. Air fares also contributed to holding down the headline inflation figure, as they rose to a lesser degree than a year ago. Economists said retailers were being pushed to lower their prices to counter falling levels of spending on the high street, which has led to brands including Marks &amp; Spencer and Mothercare closing hundreds of stores between them. Faced with mixed readings for the British economy, the Bank of England\u2019s decision on interest rates on 2 August also comes amid heightened political tension over Brexit. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the Bank should focus on providing \u201cstability to avoid further undermining business and consumer confidence\u201d against this backdrop. The Resolution Foundation said it was unlikely inflation would return to the ultra-low levels of 2015, meaning that stronger pay rises \u2013 in excess of the weak growth the UK is experiencing \u2013 would be needed to help raise living standards across the country. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cWith wage growth stalling, now is not the time to hike interest rates. Household budgets are still under huge pressure.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Premier Foods said \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d, including a sale of parts of the business, before a showdown with activist investors who are trying to oust the chief executive, Gavin Darby. The group behind Mr Kipling and Batchelors conceded it must accelerate its turnaround plans amid pressure from its second largest shareholder, Oasis Management. Darby is facing a potential shareholder rebellion led by the Hong Kong hedge fund, which is attempting to eject him at Premier\u2019s AGM on Wednesday. Speaking beforehand, he said the public row might help Premier find potential buyers for some brands, which include household names such as Angel Delight and Bisto. \u201cThe benefit of this process is there can\u2019t be a single investment banker or food company that is not aware that if the price is right the board would look at an asset sale,\u201d Darby said. Oasis, which last week doubled its stake in the company to 17.3%, accuses Darby, a former Coca-Cola and Vodafone executive, of \u201cpersistent value destruction\u201d during his five-year tenure. It claims Premier is in a \u201czombie-like state\u201d because of his failure to drive growth. Paulson &amp; Co, which controls a 6% stake in Premier, has sided with Oasis but the top shareholder Nissin Foods, which owns a 20% stake, is backing Darby. Oasis wants Premier to sell Batchelors, the Cup a Soup, noodles and pasta sauces brand, which it says could raise \u00a3200m to pay down the group\u2019s heavy debts. Premier has \u00a3496m in net debt \u2013 more than three times its underlying profits \u2013 as well as \u00a34.5bn of pension liabilities, despite a market value of only \u00a3390m. On Wednesday, Premier said it was on track to meet profit expectations as it revealed a 1.7% rise in sales in the three months to 30 June. Sales of Mr Kipling cakes rose 14% in the UK after the company launched a new ad campaign and Batchelors sales were also up. Overall, branded groceries sales fell, led by Loyd Grossman sauces, which were down because of a change in promotional activity. Unbranded \u201csweet treat\u201d sales were also down as the group lost two contracts with retailers. Premier\u2019s share price has dropped more than 20% since the American flavouring manufacturer McCormick walked away from a bid in 2016. The company also issued a profits warning in January last year. The Premier chairman, Keith Hamill, said the company had discussed in vain a sale of Batchelors early this year with Nissin Foods, the Japanese noodle maker, . \u201cIt was looked at. It didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Hamill said, adding that the company would only sell assets at an \u201cexceptional price\u201d that would enable the firm to pay off debts and invest for the future, as that was what most shareholders wanted. However, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anything is off the table.\u201d Hamill said: \u201cActivist investors are normally addressing a fat, lazy company and persuading it to take action. On average that does tend to produce a better performance. We are in fact a thin, hardworking company. However, all these things contribute to the way management and board think and does help focus concentration of all those involved on critical issues. \u201cChallenge is not a terrible thing. We\u2019ll probably get some benefit from it \u2026 We know that we need to find ways to accelerate the turnaround and what we have to say to shareholders is that that we are working at it.\u201d Premier Foods\u2019 board has backed Darby, who since joining in 2013 has halved a near \u00a31bn debt, stepped up the pace of new product development, doubled international revenues and signed lucrative agreements with Mondel\u0113z, the American foods group, and Nissin. Darby said: \u201cPremier has come an awful long way in a pretty torrid challenging environment. \u201cOf course I would like the share price to be higher. I am convinced it will be if we continue doing the things we are doing and I have invested personally in that expectation.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "\u2018He\u2019s done quite well\u2019: why Conrad Black thinks Trump is what the US needs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Since launching his bid for America\u2019s top office, Donald Trump has figured prominently in Canada\u2019s national conversation; he\u2019s been called a fascist, and a bully, and was unanimously condemned by parliamentarians after he lashed out at the prime minister, Justin Trudeau. But one voice has consistently lauded the US president: Conrad Black, the man who once controlled one of the world\u2019s largest English-language newspaper empires. From his home in Toronto, Black has emerged as one of the president\u2019s most outspoken supporters, arguing America\u2019s 45th president is exactly what the US needed. \u201cI think he\u2019s done quite well,\u201d said Black, rattling off a list of claims that have been widely challenged \u2013 or proven to be untrue. \u201cI think you would have to say that he\u2019s cut illegal immigration by 50%, he\u2019s certainly produced economic progress and has dealt effectively with the greatest single foreign policy issue so far: North Korea.\u201d Such assertions reflect the breezy, positive spin that is at the heart of Black\u2019s latest book, Donald J Trump: A President Like No Other. Black argues that Trump will be ultimately judged as a successful president who lowered taxes, eased fears of a recession and unemployment and adopted a foreign policy of \u201cprudent and effective realism\u201d. It\u2019s a largely sympathetic take on a president whose disapproval ratings hover above 50% and whose administration has polarised American society with his ban on travellers from several Muslim-majority countries, forcible separation of migrant families and trade wars with longstanding American allies. The jarring disconnect has prompted speculation that Black, who in 2007 was sentenced to prison in the US for fraud and obstruction of justice, is angling for a pardon from Trump. Black is quick to brush off the suggestion. \u201cThis irritating mindreading by people who don\u2019t know me, this imputation of motives, I think, is discreditable,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is, at this point, no thought of a pardon whatsoever.\u201d He instead pointed to biographies he has previously written on Franklin D Roosevelt and Richard Nixon, and described Trump \u2013 whom he has known for 25 years \u2013 as the ideal subject. \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely controversial and highly publicised person,\u201d Black said. \u201cLots of people see things that they on balance like, but many people are convinced that he is a terrible and a dangerous person. So the truth has to be in there somewhere.\u201d Black insisted that his take on Trump was not without its criticisms. \u201cHe\u2019s not always someone who performs in a way that I myself would consider to be optimal, but on balance he has been quite clear about what his objectives are \u2013 and he\u2019s pursuing them quite successfully.\u201d To hear Black tell it, Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran deal \u2013 which was strongly criticised by key US allies \u2013 was \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d. The tariffs launched on allies are a \u201ctemporary expedient\u201d as Trump tackles trade imbalances. Trump\u2019s justification of \u201cnational security\u201d to impose tariffs on Canada \u2013 America\u2019s closest ally \u2013 is just \u201cgood political histrionics\u201d. He dismisses any notion that Trump \u2013 who has repeatedly conflated immigration with crime and terrorism \u2013 is a racist. The idea that a man who has been accused of assault and harassment by 20 women is a misogynist is \u201crubbish\u201d, he said. \u201cHe was the first person in the United States to have a female manager of a large project, in the case of the Trump Tower.\u201d And the Mueller investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 which has so far yielded nearly three dozen indictments and five guilty pleas? A \u201ccomplete failure\u201d. Black, who was born in Montreal, does side with the many in Canada who disapproved of Trump\u2019s personal attack on Trudeau, but he said he\u2019s found that many Canadians do like the US president. \u201cCanadians would not demean themselves with anything so inane as the London Trump balloon,\u201d he argued. Black\u2019s take on Trump is rooted in what he believes was happening in the US before he took office. \u201cThe trend was obvious, the whole economy was flatlined,\u201d he said. \u201cScores of millions of people felt acute economic insecurity.\u201d He described Trump \u2013 who has been criticised for not explicitly denouncing the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and who has befriended dictators such as Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un \u2013 as a centrist. \u201cEssentially he is trying to provide a return to dynamic growth and satisfactory government provided by a centre or slightly right of center government,\u201d said Black. That mission has been complicated by media, Black asserted. \u201cHe\u2019s run against a barrage of media hostility unlike anything since Watergate,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a statement seemingly at odds with a man who once ran a media empire that stretched from the UK\u2019s Daily Telegraph to the Jerusalem Post. Does Black not believe that it is the role of media to hold the powerful to account? The question gives Black pause. \u201cOf course I accept and proclaim the duty of the media to call it as they see it, but I was always myself an upholder of maintaining the distinction between reporting and comment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd employing the normal conscientious professional standards to be accurate.\u201d While Black acknowledged that it might be too early to pass definitive judgment on Trump\u2019s tenure as president, he emphasised the billionaire businessman\u2019s trajectory from celebrity to the White House, describing it as \u201ca series of astonishing feats. \u201cI perfectly understand people who find his shtick tiresome or even frankly insufferably annoying \u2026 I understand why some people don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nobody can say that he\u2019s just a boob and an idiot who\u2019s never accomplished anything. You can\u2019t say that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In a speech in Perth to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, Karen Chester, the deputy chair of the Productivity Commission, has provided a bit of pushback on the doom and gloom scenarios about the future of work. But that does not mean things will all go smoothly. Chester argues for changes to education and greater incentives to move into work not able to be automated to ensure technology provides \u201cnot just more jobs but jobs for most\u201d. The easy headline \u2013 especially given numerous recent studies such as those done by the IMF \u2013 is to be fearful of the future for work in the face of growing automation. Chester, however, argues that the future of work is \u201csimply not so different\u201d to that of the past. \u201cHistory,\u201d Chester suggests, \u201cis littered with the foretelling of a dystopia of jobless woe or a utopia of little need to work at all. And the only universal truth seems to be that they were all wrong \u2013 both happily and unhappily so.\u201d In reality, Chester argues, \u201cfor throughout the past 100 years it\u2019s been more a case of technology remaining the loyal friend not foe of the worker \u2013 continuing to remove jobs that are often unpleasant, physically tiring, downright dangerous or just tedious (think toll booth operator)\u201d. So why do pessimists this time think it will be different? One reason is suggestions that AI is unlike mere automation. And one of the claims to support this is a 2013 study that suggested up to 40% of today\u2019s jobs are at risk from automation. But Chester argues that study \u201cdid not take into account that new technologies can create new jobs. Nor did it contemplate that not all tasks within an occupation can be automated or should be automated\u201d. Instead she suggests a more likely number is 9% of jobs at risk, as that is based on studies that take these factors into account. She also notes that one reason we may not need to fear the coming job apocalypse is that \u201ca bunch of measures suggest that technology is not having as large of an effect as expected\u201d, especially in terms of productivity. This \u201cproductivity paradox\u201d is certainly present in Australia. We are clearly becoming more reliant on IT, and yet it is contributing less to our productivity growth: One reason is that perhaps we\u2019re not yet in what economist Bart van Ark calls the \u201cdeployment phase\u201d of IT use where productivity will start to rise once \u201cusers fully grapple with how to absorb technology effectively\u201d. She also notes that if technology was actually replacing existing jobs without creating new ones, \u201cwe would expect to see a persistent upward trend in the unemployment rate\u201d \u2013 but we are not. Instead Chester notes what has happened is that routine manual and routine cognitive jobs have fallen as a proportion of jobs from 50% to 37% while non\u2010routine manual and non-routine cognitive jobs (such as childcare, aged care, nursing, office managers, designers and engineers using software) have increased from 42% to 53%. And while worries about the gig economy continue to persist, she suggests the current fears are perhaps overblown, given it \u201chas not translated yet to any increase in the proportion of the workforce being independent contractors.\u201d Indeed if we just look at the percentage of workers who are owner-managers of unincorporated enterprises with no employees (ie sole operators), if anything there has been a decline in numbers in the past five years: Chester also notes that consumer preference does play a role, asking for example, \u201cdo you want a robot cutting your hair?\u201d On this aspect I think Chester might be a bit optimistic. Had you asked customers 10 years ago if they would like to have to self-checkout at grocery stores or to go into a bank branch and find no cashiers but merely a line of ATMs, the answer would have been likely in the negative. And yet here we are. Chester does however note that some jobs, regardless of customer preference, are resistant to automation. These jobs \u201cthat require \u2018soft skills\u2019 such as good old fashioned empathy\u201d also are those that \u201caccount for the largest and growing part of our workforce.\u201d Consider for example the shift in the proportion of employees in retail trade compared to the heath sector \u2013 it is much harder to replace a nurse or aged-care worker with a machine than it is a sales assistant. And this shift is likely to continue. She notes that \u201cfor the foreseeable future 1 in 5 new jobs in Australia are projected to be for services for the NDIS\u201d. This brings problems with it. Not only is there the need to ensure our workforce is equipped to do such services, there will also be the requirement to ensure those carrying out such services are adequately paid, because otherwise there is little incentive for people to become one of the vast number of workers needed in that industry. Here Chester delivers a fair slap at our education system. She suggests that results in Stem subjects are declining, \u201cthe VET system is a mess\u201d and \u201ccurrently, the tertiary education system is set up against becoming a chef at age 40, or a dementia care worker at age 50\u201d. She argues that \u201cretraining is currently inconvenient and expensive, and our key educational institutions are more focused on research than student employment outcomes\u201d. Fixing these three aspects is crucial, she claims, for preparing for the \u201cdeployment phase\u201d of IT. She also argues that our existing copyright laws restrict the ability for our economy to become an AI producer. She notes that \u201caccess to content (be it snippets of images, maps, pixels, words, song, sounds) is needed alongside data to actually do artificial intelligence.\u201d But our copyright laws \u201cpose a seemingly impenetrable barrier to AI being alive and well in our economy.\u201d As a result, she concludes, \u201cin the absence of meaningful reform to copyright, Australia will inevitably be a net importer of AI services and resultant services and products.\u201d Chester\u2019s speech is a solid response to the doom and gloom regarding the future of work \u2013 especially given thus far most of the worries about the net destruction of work from AI are still more predictions than reality. But that doesn\u2019t mean there is no cause for worry. While some of the work likely to be resistant to AI will remain high paying, much of the work which cannot be replaced by robots, and for which there is a growing demand \u2013 such as in health care and social services \u2013 is relatively undervalued in the current market. The future of work will not only require different types of training, it may also require different ways of valuing the work that can only be done by humans to ensure what Chester calls \u201ca sense of equality\u201d in the ultimate job, productivity and wage dividend that will come from technology. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "body": "<p>In a speech in Perth to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, Karen Chester, the deputy chair of the Productivity Commission, has provided a bit of pushback on the doom and gloom scenarios about the future of work. But that does not mean things will all go smoothly. Chester argues for changes to education and greater incentives to move into work not able to be automated to ensure technology provides \u201cnot just more jobs but jobs for most\u201d. </p> <p>The easy headline \u2013 especially given numerous recent studies such as those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/27/the-imfs-research-on-robots-hits-you-between-the-eyes-with-pessimism\">done by the IMF</a> \u2013 is to be fearful of the future for work in the face of growing automation. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/27/the-imfs-research-on-robots-hits-you-between-the-eyes-with-pessimism\">Why the robot revolution risks an economic 'death spiral' for Australia | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chester, however, argues that the future of work is \u201csimply not so different\u201d to that of the past. </p> <p>\u201cHistory,\u201d Chester suggests, \u201cis littered with the foretelling of a dystopia of jobless woe or a utopia of little need to work at all. And the only universal truth seems to be that they were all wrong \u2013 both happily and unhappily so.\u201d</p> <p>In reality, Chester argues, \u201cfor throughout the past 100 years it\u2019s been more a case of technology remaining the loyal friend not foe of the worker \u2013 continuing to remove jobs that are often unpleasant, physically tiring, downright dangerous or just tedious (think toll booth operator)\u201d.</p> <p>So why do pessimists this time think it will be different? One reason is suggestions that AI is unlike mere automation. And one of the claims to support this is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/view/1314\"> a 2013 study</a> that suggested up to 40% of today\u2019s jobs are at risk from automation.</p> <p>But Chester argues that study \u201cdid not take into account that new technologies can create new jobs. Nor did it contemplate that not all tasks within an occupation can be automated or should be automated\u201d.</p> <p>Instead she suggests a more likely number is 9% of jobs at risk, as that is based on studies that take these factors into account.</p> <p>She also notes that one reason we may not need to fear the coming job apocalypse is that \u201ca bunch of measures suggest that technology is not having as large of an effect as expected\u201d, especially in terms of productivity.</p> <p>This \u201cproductivity paradox\u201d is certainly present in Australia. We are clearly becoming more reliant on IT, and yet it is contributing less to our productivity growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of IT capital per hour to labour productivity growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LwvgT/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>One reason is that perhaps we\u2019re not yet in what economist Bart van Ark calls the \u201cdeployment phase\u201d of IT use where productivity will start to rise once \u201cusers fully grapple with how to absorb technology effectively\u201d.</p> <p>She also notes that if technology was actually replacing existing jobs without creating new ones, \u201cwe would expect to see a persistent upward trend in the unemployment rate\u201d \u2013 but we are not. </p> <p>Instead Chester notes what has happened is that routine manual and routine cognitive jobs have fallen as a proportion of jobs from 50% to 37% while non\u2010routine manual and non-routine cognitive jobs (such as childcare, aged care, nursing, office managers, designers and engineers using software) have increased from 42% to 53%.</p> <p>And while worries about the gig economy continue to persist, she suggests the current fears are perhaps overblown, given it \u201chas not translated yet to any increase in the proportion of the workforce being independent contractors.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed if we just look at the percentage of workers who are owner-managers of unincorporated enterprises with no employees (ie sole operators), if anything there has been a decline in numbers in the past five years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percent of employed who are owner/manager of unincorporated enterprise without employees\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iCluB/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>Chester also notes that consumer preference does play a role, asking for example, \u201cdo you want a robot cutting your hair?\u201d<br></p> <p>On this aspect I think Chester might be a bit optimistic.
