    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government's careful plans for a measured response to the expected news on Thursday that the British economy has finally crawled out of a double-dip recession were blown off course on Wednesday when official statisticians launched an inquiry into whether David Cameron had prematurely leaked the news in an attempt to score a political point at prime minister's questions. The row, a precursors to a much bigger political argument over whether the economy is starting to perform better than many expected six months ago, came after Cameron told the Labour leader, Ed Miliband: \"The good news is going to keep coming.\" The prime minister is on a highly restricted list of senior politicians given access to market-sensitive information 24 hours before publication of Thursday's third-quarter growth figures. No 10 refused to say if he had looked at the information and said his remark was just a general reference to a range of recent good figures on the economy, including falling inflation and lower than expected public borrowing. Labour said Cameron's assertion in the Commons that positive signs on the economy \"will keep coming\" was a clear reference to the keenly awaited numbers. They are widely expected to show that the UK economy may have grown by as much as 0.7% to 1.0% in the third quarter, bolstered by Olympic ticket sales and a bounce back after the diamond jubilee dip. A spokesman for the UK Statistics Authority said it was going to look into the prime minister's words. The head of the authority, Andrew Dilnot, has been trying to prevent politicians being given access to the information, describing the practice as absurd. Nick Clegg tried to set the more restrained tone planned by the coalition in a speech to the City on Wednesday, saying: \"Bluntly, with the economy still fragile, this is not the time for dogma. There's a lot of speculation about what tomorrow's GDP figures will bring. Whatever they look like, we know that, overall, we've set the economy on the right path. But recovery is slow and fitful. Repairing the damage following the shock in 2008 is a gradual healing process.\" Outlining Labour's expected response, the shadow Treasury secretary, Rachel Reeves, said: \"The prime minister seems to have let slip what we already knew \u2013 that the Olympics will help Britain finally emerge from the longest double-dip recession since the second world war. \"The question is what the underlying growth rate of the economy is when we strip out the one-off Olympics and bank holiday effects. What really matters for jobs, living standards and the deficit is whether there is a strong and sustained recovery, and whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years. \"Growth of 1% would simply mean the economy is the same size as a year ago. A one-off boost from the Olympics is no substitute for a long-term strategy and should not breed yet more complacency from David Cameron and George Osborne.\" The Office for National Statistics has made clear that billions of pounds of Olympics TV rights and ticket sales from the last 18 months will all be accounted for in the third quarter of 2012, regardless of when the money was spent. The recovery of output lost because of the jubilee bank holiday is estimated to be worth about 0.5% in the third quarter. The ONS raises the prospect that the fourth quarter will struggle to overcome the comparison, so seeing the economy slip back into contraction, if not recession. Labour points out that since the spending review in autumn 2010, Britain's economy has shrunk by 0.4%, compared with the 4.6% growth forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Britain is one of just two G20 countries to go into a double-dip recession this year. Labour acknowledges that growth is likely to have recovered by the election, but expects living standards will still be squeezed. But ministers have been looking at better than expected employment figures, as well as the fall in inflation, as tentative signs that the economy is more robust than some had estimated. They have also been relieved by lower than expected borrowing figures suggesting it is just possible that George Osborne will be able to say he can meet his fiscal target of debt falling as a proportion of GDP in 2015. The final pieces of the jigsaw suggesting recovery could occur more quickly than expected are growing signs that the worst of the euro crisis is over. That kind of thinking prompted Cameron to claim: \"It's only a bad week if you think it's bad that unemployment's coming down. It's only a bad week if you regret inflation coming down.\" His tone jarred with a speech on Tuesday by Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, who warned that the \"zigzag pattern of quarterly growth rates of GDP\" was likely to continue. He added economic output was still barely higher than two years ago, and that he expected it might take five years for the economy to recover.",

      "bodyText": "Ford has called a meeting of trade union officials in the UK this morning amid speculation that its Southampton plant is at risk of closure with the loss of 500 jobs. The continuing crisis in the eurozone has forced the US car maker to restructure its European operations and yesterday it announced the shutting of a Belgian factory with 4,300 redundancies. Ford declined to comment on reports that it is preparing to close its Southampton site, which employs 500 people and makes Transit vans - the only vehicle that Ford makes in the UK. However, it has taken the unusual step of calling its British trade union representatives to a meeting at its Basildon technical centre at 10am on Thursday. The staff representatives will be addressed by Stephen Odell, head of Ford's European operations, who said on Wednesday that Ford had to address a capacity glut caused by a 20% fall in demand in western Europe since 2007.

    "webTitle": "Argos revamp long overdue but investors may have longer to wait", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Home Retail Group's review of its Argos business took six months to complete but should have happened five years ago. The broad conclusion - be a \"digital-led\" retailer - is uncontentious but could have been adopted in 2007, when Argos's profits were a fat \u00a3376m and the coming revolution in shopping habits was already obvious. Even five years ago, 16% of its sales were arriving via the internet. The figure is now 42% but the company still prints 17m copies of its brick-sized catalogue twice a year. That nonsense will now be reined in. Instead, \u00a3100m will be spent each year for the next three years to upgrade IT systems to cope better with the full set of digital devices. As overhauls go, \u00a3300m sounds reasonable for a business with a sales base of \u00a33.9bn. Will it work? In theory, the targets are pedestrian - push sales up to \u00a34.5bn and achieve a \"mid single digit\" profit margin. At a 5% margin, that would imply operating profits of \u00a3225m, or three times the miserable \u00a375m-ish expected this year. We'll believe it when we see it, seems to be the City's view. One can understand why. There is the real possibility that Argos' self-help measures, even if executed well, will prove popular with the punters but take ages to improve the lot of shareholders. That is roughly where Dixons, another high street name forced to adapt to the digital age in a hurry, finds itself. The problem for both chains is that the non-food multi-channel jungle is populated by big beasts such as Amazon and the supermarkets making chunky investments. The squeeze is on.

      "body": "<p>Home Retail Group's review of its Argos business took six months to complete but should have happened five years ago. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/24/argos-digital-led-home-retail-group\" title=\"\">The broad conclusion - be a \"digital-led\" retailer</a> - is uncontentious but could have been adopted in 2007, when Argos's profits were a fat \u00a3376m and the coming revolution in shopping habits was already obvious. Even five years ago, 16% of its sales were arriving via the internet.</p> <p>The figure is now 42% but the company still prints 17m copies of its brick-sized catalogue twice a year. That nonsense will now be reined in. Instead, \u00a3100m will be spent each year for the next three years to upgrade IT systems to cope better with the full set of digital devices. As overhauls go, \u00a3300m sounds reasonable for a business with a sales base of \u00a33.9bn.</p> <p>Will it work? In theory, the targets are pedestrian - push sales up to \u00a34.5bn and achieve a \"mid single digit\" profit margin. At a 5% margin, that would imply operating profits of \u00a3225m, or three times the miserable \u00a375m-ish expected this year.</p> <p>We'll believe it when we see it, seems to be the City's view. One can understand why. There is the real possibility that Argos' self-help measures, even if executed well, will prove popular with the punters but take ages to improve the lot of shareholders. That is roughly where Dixons, another high street name forced to adapt to the digital age in a hurry, finds itself. The problem for both chains is that the non-food multi-channel jungle is populated by big beasts such as Amazon and the supermarkets making chunky investments. The squeeze is on.</p> <p>Still, there's no doubt that Home Retail has the cash to give it go. It generated \u00a3122m in the first half of this financial year and had net funds of \u00a3316m on 1 September. Rather than a mass-cull of stores, chief executive Terry Duddy prefers the opportunity to screw better terms out of its landlords as leases expire; that seems a reasonable plan (much better, for example, than his unforgivable squandering of cash on share buy-backs in 2010, ahead of a share price collapse).

      "bodyText": "Struggling retailer Argos is attempting to drag itself into the 21st century by giving the business a digital overhaul that will diminish the importance of its traditional catalogue and lead to at least 75 store closures or relocations. Its parent company Home Retail Group said it would reduce the circulation of the Argos catalogue, which was launched in 1973 and currently has a biannual print-run of around 17m copies, as it refocuses the chain as a \"digital-led retailer\". However, it insisted that \"print marketing will always be important to us\". Home Retail's chief executive, Terry Duddy, admitted that the company needed to \"invest to restore Argos to growth\" as he said that the company would spend \u00a3100m a year for the next three years to implement a five-year, four-part turnaround plan. The strategy involves focusing Argos on digital channels, providing faster availability of wider product ranges, supplementing its existing customer base by attracting more affluent consumers with new product lines, and cutting costs. The company also confirmed plans to close or relocate 75 stores in its 739-strong estate and move shops into shorter leases. Originally 50 stores had been expected to shut. John Walden, the new Argos boss who has developed the plan, said: \"We make a lot of money from our stores and they generate a lot of cash. When you have stores that generate cash you can invest in the business and at the same time as any leases expire [change those terms]. It is a very fortunate position to be in.\" The company added that seven stores lost money, although on average each store made just \u00a3172 a week in the six months to September. The new Argos strategy comes after a six-month review of the chain to revive the flagging business. In half-year results announced with the new plan, Home Retail \u2013 which also includes Homebase \u2013 said underlying earnings at Argos were 3% down at \u00a33.3m with a return to like-for-like sales growth, up 0.6% in the six months to 1 September. In total Home Retail announced pre-tax profit of \u00a318m, which was down 37% but a big improvement on the analysts' consensus forecast of \u00a312.2m. Sales fell by 1% to \u00a32.53bn. The shares, which initially spiked in early trading on news of the better-than-expected profits, swiftly returned to where they started the morning at around 105p as analysts wondered if the new Argos strategy would be enough. Philip Dorgan, a retail analyst at Panmure, wrote to clients: \"Home Retail has reported another big fall in interim profits and we don't think that the business review of Argos has found a magic bullet. That said, these numbers are a beat, the interim dividend has been restored and the targets set for sales and margin at Argos are likely to increase optimism that value can be created. We are therefore increasing our target price from 51p to 80p, but we are retaining our 'sell', because we seldom see sales and margin targets attained in retailing and we think that Argos is a difficult fix.\"",

      "bodyText": "Sir Donald Cruickshank has condemned the government's shakeup of financial regulation, warning that it will fail to tackle competition and that it will concentrate too much power in the hands of the Bank of England. In a statement, published as he appeared before the cross-party parliamentary commission on banking standards, the veteran competitions expert urged MPs and peers: \"Do not implement the huge concentration of power in the Bank of England that is inherent in the government's proposals for banking reform. Therein lie the roots of future crises and ineffective regulation.\" Cruickshank, who carried out two reviews of banking sector for the Labour government, told the committee, chaired by the Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, that he expected the recommendations of the Vickers commission \u2013 separating retail banking from the riskier parts of the business \u2013 to raise standards of behaviour among the banks. But he warned that the other elements of the new regime, including setting up a new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to protect consumers and handing the Bank of England the power to supervise the financial sector, would fail to improve competition. The government is keen to loosen the grip of the Big Four high street banks \u2013 Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and HSBC \u2013 on the market, and has encouraged \"challenger banks\", including Virgin Money, to increase the size of their UK operations. But Cruickshank, a former chair of the London Stock Exchange, would like to see a specific competition authority for the financial sector, with the power to implement its own rulings. He told the committee that because of its special role in transmitting money through the economy, the banking system should be considered as effectively part of the state and regulated accordingly. \"This sector demands, for security, efficiency and prosperity, invasive and harsh regulation, and if those who enter the industry say that it's unfair, well they can go off and do something else,\" he said. Describing the role of the FCA, and speaking as a former regulator himself \u2013 of the telecoms sector \u2013 he said the government's financial services bill fails to make promoting competition the central concern for the new body. \"Sir Humphrey lives!\" he said, referring to wily permanent secretary in the political comedy Yes Minister. \"There are three qualifying phrases before competition is even mentioned.\" He said future regulators will be forced to take account, \"not just what Parliament said in debate, but what the words actually mean in the Act.\" Cruickshank's key recommendations in his two reviews of banking, which included giving the Financial Services Authority an overriding goal of pushing competition in the industry, was never fully implemented. But lest his audience get too carried away with the outrageous behaviour of the City's finest in the runup to the credit crisis, he also gave the committee a history lesson, urging them to read Anthony Trollope's The Way We Live Now - the classic Victorian novel about the era of speculation that led up to the great crash in 1929. \"The Trollope reference is to Trollope coming back from years abroad to find a City, London, wrapped in greed, and it was the precursor to the great depression,\" Cruickshank said. \"His book is about not just the behaviour of the City, but Westminster as well, interestingly.

      "bodyText": "Factory orders fell in October, fuelling fears that a much hoped for recovery in the runup to Christmas has already run out of steam. The survey of industrial trends by the CBI found that the total order book balance dropped to -23 this month from -8 in September. Domestic and export orders fell and output tailed off over the three months to October, highlighting the problems manufacturers face as the UK works to haul itself out of recession amid ongoing public sector austerity at home and in key European markets. Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Thursday are expected to show a temporary boost from the Olympics increased GDP by between 0.5% and 0.8% in the three months to the end of September, ending a nine-month decline in national income. However, many analysts expect the economy to contract again in the final quarter of the year. David Tinsley, UK economist at investment bank BNP Paribas, said the figures were shocking and blew away \"any hope that the UK manufacturing sector would dodge the bullet from the weakness in the eurozone manufacturing\". The survey found the industry remains hopeful conditions will improve, despite revealing a sharp rise in the number of firms worried that further political turmoil in the eurozone and US will undermine consumer and business confidence. A steady decline over the last year in the number of firms prepared to invest in new plant and machinery continued in October. The figures will disappoint the chancellor George Osborne as he prepares his outlook for the economy in his autumn statement on 5 December. Osborne is under pressure to show the economy is recovering after four years of lacklustre growth that has left the UK's national income 4% below the 2007 peak. The drop in orders surprised analysts, who said the best that could be said about the survey was that the outlook for conditions across the manufacturing sector remained broadly stable. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic analysis, said: \"Domestic and overseas demand have both slipped unexpectedly this quarter, while output growth has tailed off. Sentiment regarding business conditions has also fallen back, particularly for exports. UK companies are increasingly concerned by political and economic conditions abroad, whether it is ongoing weakness and uncertainty in the eurozone or the approaching fiscal cliff in the US. \"Nevertheless, employment has continued to rise, investment intentions remain reasonably healthy and expectations for output and orders have held up.\"",

      "body": "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has risked a backlash from European carmakers and governments by rescuing France's Peugeot Citro\u00ebn with a \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.66bn) state-financing package, as Ford announced the loss of 4,300 jobs in Belgium.</p> <p>The German state of Lower Saxony, the second largest investor in Volkswagen, has already expressed opposition to the financing plan and Peugeot must also seek European Union approval for the deal. Meanwhile Ford said it would shut its Genk plant in Belgium as European carmakers grapple with too much factory capacity amid slumping sales. The French government is offering \u20ac7bn in refinancing guarantees for Peugeot's financing arm, Banque PSA Finance, which underpins Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn dealer networks and car loans.</p> <p>\"The French state has announced its intention to provide up to \u20ac7bn in refinancing guarantees for new bond issues \u2026 A guarantee monitoring committee comprising representatives from the state and the group will be set up,\" said Peugeot, which has no French state shareholding and is 25%-owned by the Peugeot family. The company's future became a state matter in July when Peugeot, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/16/european-car-sales-fall-new-car-registrations\" title=\"\">battered by falling European car sales</a>, announced the closure its Aulnay plant near Paris and plans to axe 6,500 jobs.</p> <p>The Peugeot family's control is being weakened by the terms of the government intervention. Peugeot added that it will not pay dividends, launch share buybacks or grant share options to senior executives while the state guarantee is in place. It also agreed to elect an employee to its supervisory board and \"elect more women\". The board will also appoint a new independent member, although reports this week said that independent member would be government-approved.</p> <p>Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French prime minister, said Peugeot would be asked to reconsider the Aulnay closure as a condition of the financing. \"The government has no intention of making gifts without demanding anything in return,\" he said. It is France's biggest intervention in its car industry since 2009, when it gave Peugeot and Renault \u20ac6bn in low-interest loans.</p> <p>Peugeot said this morning that third-quarter sales fell 4% to \u20ac12.9bn in the three months to September. \"The competitive environment is getting tougher, with increased pricing pressure and ongoing deterioration in the markets of southern Europe,\" the company said.</p> <p>Peugeot is not the only Europe-based automotive business struggling with stagnant sales and too much manufacturing capacity. Ford said this morning that it plans to shut its assembly plant in Genk, Belgium, in 2014 with the loss of 4,300 jobs as production moves to Spain.

      "bodyText": "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has risked a backlash from European carmakers and governments by rescuing France's Peugeot Citro\u00ebn with a \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.66bn) state-financing package, as Ford announced the loss of 4,300 jobs in Belgium. The German state of Lower Saxony, the second largest investor in Volkswagen, has already expressed opposition to the financing plan and Peugeot must also seek European Union approval for the deal. Meanwhile Ford said it would shut its Genk plant in Belgium as European carmakers grapple with too much factory capacity amid slumping sales. The French government is offering \u20ac7bn in refinancing guarantees for Peugeot's financing arm, Banque PSA Finance, which underpins Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn dealer networks and car loans. \"The French state has announced its intention to provide up to \u20ac7bn in refinancing guarantees for new bond issues \u2026 A guarantee monitoring committee comprising representatives from the state and the group will be set up,\" said Peugeot, which has no French state shareholding and is 25%-owned by the Peugeot family. The company's future became a state matter in July when Peugeot, battered by falling European car sales, announced the closure its Aulnay plant near Paris and plans to axe 6,500 jobs. The Peugeot family's control is being weakened by the terms of the government intervention. Peugeot added that it will not pay dividends, launch share buybacks or grant share options to senior executives while the state guarantee is in place. It also agreed to elect an employee to its supervisory board and \"elect more women\". The board will also appoint a new independent member, although reports this week said that independent member would be government-approved. Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French prime minister, said Peugeot would be asked to reconsider the Aulnay closure as a condition of the financing. \"The government has no intention of making gifts without demanding anything in return,\" he said. It is France's biggest intervention in its car industry since 2009, when it gave Peugeot and Renault \u20ac6bn in low-interest loans. Peugeot said this morning that third-quarter sales fell 4% to \u20ac12.9bn in the three months to September. \"The competitive environment is getting tougher, with increased pricing pressure and ongoing deterioration in the markets of southern Europe,\" the company said. Peugeot is not the only Europe-based automotive business struggling with stagnant sales and too much manufacturing capacity. Ford said this morning that it plans to shut its assembly plant in Genk, Belgium, in 2014 with the loss of 4,300 jobs as production moves to Spain. Volvo, the Gothenburg-based truck maker, said it expected no growth in the European and US markets next year after third-quarter orders fell by a quarter compared with the same period last year.

That unpopularity is likely to deepen when the Fine Gael-Labour government impose a range of spending cuts including slashing social welfare and next taxes on properties in the forthcoming December budget.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Golden Victoria is presented by the German Magazine Publishers Association (VDZ), but I must confess I don't know why the award is so named.</p> <p><em>The only Golden Victoria round here is called <strong>Pendleton</strong>, and is famous for&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18905936\">going round in circles</a> very swiftly, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/24/eurozone-crisis-greece-austerity-memorandum-draghi#block-5087ee2195cb4897f0db5261\">Rather like a certain finance minister today....</a></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50882af395cb4897f0db528b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T17:52:51.504Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bye Bye Berlusconi</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2a8aef62-832d-4357-bf32-3bea8d77a33c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351101073128/7f3a08f5-23df-445d-9da7-3eb1592976a5-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, in May 2012.

Why? Because the damn GDP keeps decreasing day after day.</p> <p>How will EU / ECB / IMF get their money back if they continue causing said GDP to fall, fall, and then fall some more?

A lot of comments have been made about this commitment. But we have to understand how markets work. Interventions are designed to send a clear signal to investors that their fears about the euro area are baseless.</p> <p>Second, as a pre-requisite for OMTs, countries must have negotiated with the other euro area governments a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme with strict and effective conditionality. This ensures that governments continue to correct economic weaknesses while the ECB is active. The involvement of the IMF, with its unparalleled track record in monitoring adjustment programmes would be an additional safeguard.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp121024.en.html\">The full statement has been uploaded to the ECB website</a>.</p> <p>Draghi also warned that deflation is a bigger risk than inflation today, which may not convince German lawmakers who fear a return to the 1920s.</p> <p>Dow Jones Newswires' <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/djfxtrader\"><strong>FXTrader</strong></a> service tweets other highlights:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082243638886400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB's Draghi Sees Weak Economy In Near Term, Gradual Recovery in 2013</p>&mdash; DJ FX Trader (@djfxtrader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082243638886400\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:30:32+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082649303605248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB's Draghi Tells German Lawmakers Governments Alone Could Not Remove Fear</p>&mdash; DJ FX Trader (@djfxtrader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082649303605248\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:32:08+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082759487971329\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB's Draghi Says ECB Only \"Fully Credible Backstop\" Could Remove Market Fear</p>&mdash; DJ FX Trader (@djfxtrader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082759487971329\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:32:35+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:56:31.068Z\">at 1.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087e10695cb4897f0db525c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:37:26.540Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Germany denies Greek deal is done</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>News is flashing up that Germany has denied that Greece has got the two-year extension (as finance minister Stournaras claimed - see last few posts).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/261080782012039168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>***German government spokesman says there is no basis for the Greek 2-year extension reports***</p>&mdash; Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/261080782012039168\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:24:43+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Curiouser and curiouser.

To recap... \u2022 Greece does still not have a deal with its lenders (whatever Yannis Stournaras may have told parliament at one stage). See 14.33 backwards \u2022 Leaked details of Greece's memorandum of understanding have leaked. See 9.12 \u2022 As has a controversial proposal from Germany to take more control of Greece's finances. See 10.01 \u2022 Mario Draghi has smoothed the Bundestag's ruffled feathers over his bond-buying programme. See 15.11 onwards for highlghts from his press conference, and 13.51 for his opening statement. \u2022 A grim set of economic data has shown that Europe is sliding deeper into recession. See 10.57 onwards \u2022 The US Federal Reserve has left interest rates and quantitative easing unchanged. See 19.19 onwards. Tomorrow will be a big day in the UK when the first estimate for GDP for the last quarter is released (although David Cameron has rather let the cat out of the bag - see 16.12). Until then, thanks for your comments and all the help. Goodnight! Word from Athens: finance minister Yannis Stournaras hopes to tell officials from the eurozone the details of Greece's deal with the Troika on Friday: Assuming we have a deal by then.... Here's some reaction to the Fed's decision on interest rates and QE (see 19.19 onwards), from Twitter: The statement issued by the Federal Reserve explaining its monetary policy decision is now online. In it, the Fed pledges to continue Operation Twist (its policy of selling long-dated bonds to push the yield curve down) and to keep recycling profits from its QE holdings into mortgage-backed securites. It explained: These actions, which together will increase the Committee\u2019s holdings of longer-term securities by about $85bn each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Fed also predicted that US interest rates will remain at \"exceptionally low levels\" until at least the middle of 2015. The vote was not unanimous - Jeffrey M. Lacke opposed additional asset purchases. And finally, the US Federal Reserve has just announced its decision on monetary policy following a two-day meeting. Drumroll.... It's no change on interest rates, which remain at 0 to 0.25%, and no change on quantitative easing, with the Fed agreeing to maintain existing programmes. That means it will keep buying $40bn of mortgage securities until the US employment situation improves. Highlights of the statement to follow! Readers of a certain vintage may remember that Mikhail Gorbachev was hugely popular across the world in the 1980s and early 1990s, except in the decaying Soviet Union. Well, the parable of Gorby may have lessons for Ireland's Enda Kenny.... as our own Henry McDonald reports from Dublin: Irish Premier Enda Kenny is European of the year for his guidance of Ireland through the storm of the Eurozone crisis. It was announced today that the Taoiseach will receive \"Golden Victoria European of the Year 2012\" award in Berlin on 8 November. For Kenny this is the second international accolade in the last few weeks after 'Time' magazine singled him out for lavish praise. In the magazine's last edition it had a portrait of Kenny on the front page praising him and his government. The latest award to Kenny recognises his strong contribution to Europe and his commitment to European ideals. Previous winners include the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. Kenny's Fine Gael party welcomed the award but added that it \"acknowledges the achievements not only of Enda Kenny but Ireland and the Irish people.\" Despite being lauded in the international media and now portrayed as a European statesman Kenny and his coalition government remain unpopular at home. That unpopularity is likely to deepen when the Fine Gael-Labour government impose a range of spending cuts including slashing social welfare and next taxes on properties in the forthcoming December budget. The Golden Victoria is presented by the German Magazine Publishers Association (VDZ), but I must confess I don't know why the award is so named. The only Golden Victoria round here is called Pendleton, and is famous for going round in circles very swiftly, Rather like a certain finance minister today.... Political developments in Italy tonight: Silvio Berlusconi has confirmed that he will not run for office in next spring's elections. His People of Freedom party (PDL) must now choose a successor. Gazzetta del sud has the quotes from Berlusconi: For the love of Italy, one can do crazy and wise things Eighteen years ago I came into office, a foolhardy venture not devoid of wisdom. Now I choose to take a step back, for the same love that moved me to act back then. The obligatory bunga-bunga joke is left as an exercise for the reader. The news doesn't harm Mario Monti's chances of staying on as prime minister - Monti won't run himself, but could be asked to stay on in the national interest. Earlier today, Monti argued that the European Union should not fret about Italy's upcoming parliamentary elections because the next government will respect previous commitments. Especially if he's running it?... In the readers comments, Sovjohn explains succinctly why Greece needs a two-year extension, and why it won't really ease the pain. In essence, because the turmoil caused by two general elections this year -- and the deeper than forecast recession -- means Greece now has to find \u20ac2bn more in savings than originally planned. Here's a flavour In fact, out of 13.5 bn of measures, 9 bn are due to be taken in 2013, i.e. \"immediately\". This is not at all radically different to the original MoU signed in 2012. If nothing else, it's \"worse\", since back then the measures would also be taken in 2013-2014, but would be 11.5 bn, not 13.5. And in conclusion: Greece \"cut\" its debt to the private sector by 100 bn and it still has dramatically higher debt-to-GDP ratio. Why? Because the damn GDP keeps decreasing day after day. How will EU / ECB / IMF get their money back if they continue causing said GDP to fall, fall, and then fall some more? I don't think they can, because debt-to-GDP will eventually reach 400% or something, and people will kill the politicians in riots at that point before agreeing to repay this monstrous level of debt. As hoped, details of Mario Draghi's appearance at the Bundestag are now leaking out: Hmmm - under the deal hammered out at last week's summit, the legal framework for the eurozone bank supervisor is means to be agreed by the end of this year, with implementation during 2013. Paris has argued that it could be up and running within a few months, but Draghi's comment suggest otherwise. Good news for Portugal: The International Monetary Fund has just confirmed that it will release the next tranche of bailout money worth \u20ac1.5bn to Lisbon. This follows an IMF review of the Portuguese programme -- and recent announcements of further austerity measures to keep the country on track. A reminder that the proposal from the German finance ministry for the troika to have new controls over Greece's finances can be read in full online. I put one link up this morning (see 9.36) -- there's another one here, which looks better formatted. It was a quiet day in Europe's financial markets, after yesterday's selloff. Here are the closing prices: FTSE 100: up 6 points at 5804, + 0.1% German DAX: up 19 points at 7192, +0.27% French CAC: up 19 points at 3426, + 0.59% Spanish IBEX: up 43 points at 7791, + 0.57% Italian FTSE MIB: up 127 points at 15706, + 0.8% Josh Raymond of City Index says there was caution in the City today: Traders are juxtaposed between looking for bargains and reducing risk, fearing a more aggressive move lower. A tin hats half-on day, as they might say elsewhere Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith says officials seem to be hedging their bets on the US elections finally resolving the impasse - and unlocking funds even if the thorny issue of labour reforms isn't overcome. She writes: \"Even if the troika give us a negative report what are they going to do? Are they really going to not give us the installment ( to keep Greece's debt-choked econony afloat) two weeks before the US elections with everything that entails - default, bankruptcy, global market turmoil,\" asked one senior Greek official. \"These labour reforms will turn our country into Bangladesh. They have no fiscal benefit and will actually derail the adjustment program. The political system will collapse if we impose them. The Troika is demanding that we commit suicide which is why we believe this is a matter that should be solved on a political level by the PM and not here in Athens with the troika.\" J\u00fcrgen Stark, the ECB's former chief economist, has been speaking bluntly about the state of the eurozone at a conference in Brussels Open Europe, the think tank, has the quotes: Stark, incidentally, resigned from the ECB 13 months ago, in a sign of rifts within the ECB over monetary policy. And Slovakia's Iveta Radi\u010dov\u00e1, who lost power in March this year, also said politicians must take the blame for the crisis: Britain's prime minister may have got himself into hot water, after boasting about how the UK economy is recovering. During prime minister's questions, David Cameron told parliament that: I can tell him, the good news will keep coming. \"Him\" being Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition. (full details of the exchange are in our Politics Live blog with Andrew Sparrow) As we get the first estimate of UK GDP data for the last three months tomorrow morning, Cameron's comments have been interpreted as a hint that Britain has come out of recession (as most economists predict). But they may also breach the rules, as the Daily Telegraph's Rosa Prince reports: Did David Cameron break law by letting slip growth figures? David Cameron has been accused of breaking the law by appearing to drop a hint about market-sensitive growth figures not published until tomorrow. However, I don't think we're looking at a Hugh Dalton moment (the Labour chancellor resigned in 1947 after telling some details of his Budget to a journalist, shortly before the speech). Norbert Lammert, president of the Bundestag, is also taking part in the press conference (see 15.00 onwards) He said Draghi's talk had \"enhanced understanding and trust\" between the European central bank and the German parliament. Draghi was also at pains to sound upbeat, saying it was a useful opportunity to express views in a way that could be understood by the non-specialist, who doesn't work on these issues 24-hours a day. And with that the press conference was over. Now we wait for German lawmakers to leak what really happened. Mario Draghi also shot down those reports earlier today that Greece has been given another 24-months grace to hit its targets. The ECB president said the troika's review of the Greek economy was not complete - only then could decisions be taken. He added: I cannot comment on these rumours. Mario Draghi is giving his press conference in the Bundestag now, following his session before German MPs. He told reporters that he assured lawmakers that his bond-buying programme was \"fully in compliance with the ECB's mandate of price stability for the entire eurozone\". Draghi described his visit as an important piece of \"trust building\", particularly with the German public. He was asked whether he could return home, confident that he had reassured Germany's taxpayers. Draghi smoothly replied that it was too early for that sort of confidence(!). Further indication that Greece hasn't won a two-year extension to its fiscal reform programme (officially anyway), from Germany's finance minister. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told reporters in Berlin that a deal isn't possible until the troika concludes its report and the eurozone's finance ministers have read it. FT Alphaville has romped through the details of the German finance ministry's demand for tighter controi of Greece's finances (as blogged about from 9.36am). Good place to start if you're trying to get up to speed: Germany wants Greece to hand over more budget control Remarkably, Greece's finance minister appears to have now admitted that Athens doesn't have a deal with the Troika over the aid package after all. Barely 90 minute after telling the Greek parliament that an agreement had been hammered out (see 13.18), Yannis Stournaras then told MPs that, well, it hasn't. Yet. Over to Reuters: Greece's government is still trying to win additional concessions from foreign lenders on an austerity plan even though the bulk of negotiations have been completed, Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras told parliament on Wednesday. \"To a great extent, the negotiations have been completed,\" Stournaras said. \"But even now, we are trying for improvements.\" Earlier on Wednesday, Stournaras said the package of austerity cuts and reforms had been finalized and was ready to be put to parliament next week. This dizzying u-turn came after a German government spokesman denied that Greece had got its two-year extension (a key part of any deal) (see 13.37). Doubtless it'll all become clear eventually.... The Wall Street Journal says it's got its hands on the latest draft version of the memorandum of understanding for the Greek aid deal/austerity plan, and it apparently does include the two-year extension. It adds that the MOU also includes raising the retirement age to 67, and putting 25,000 civil servants into a labour pool prior to being laid off - but you knew that hours ago :) One key part of Mario Draghi's pitch to the Bundestag (see 13.51) is that the ECB had to act as markets were not prepared to wait for reforms to take hold. Only a \"fully credible backstop\" (ie the promise to buy the sovereign debt of a country seeking help) would work. And that, he adds, is in the interest of all the eurozone's creditors, including Germany.... We'll find out in around an hour whether this message went down well, when Draghi holds a press conference (eta 3pm BST) Mario Draghi has defended his Outright Monetary Transactions plan to the Bundestag in the last few minutes. Draghi promised German MPs that the pledge to buy unlimited quantities of bonds will dispel fears over the euro's future. The ECB president also began his two-hour appearance in Berlin by repeating his line that politicians, not central bankers, must take the decisive steps to ensure Europe's future Here's how Draghi defended the OMT, which he insisted did not put taxpayers at risk. We designed the OMTs exactly to...restore monetary policy transmission in two key ways. First, it provides for ex ante unlimited interventions in government bond markets, focusing on bonds with a remaining maturity of up to three years. A lot of comments have been made about this commitment. But we have to understand how markets work. Interventions are designed to send a clear signal to investors that their fears about the euro area are baseless. Second, as a pre-requisite for OMTs, countries must have negotiated with the other euro area governments a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme with strict and effective conditionality. This ensures that governments continue to correct economic weaknesses while the ECB is active. The involvement of the IMF, with its unparalleled track record in monitoring adjustment programmes would be an additional safeguard. The full statement has been uploaded to the ECB website. Draghi also warned that deflation is a bigger risk than inflation today, which may not convince German lawmakers who fear a return to the 1920s. Dow Jones Newswires' FXTrader service tweets other highlights: News is flashing up that Germany has denied that Greece has got the two-year extension (as finance minister Stournaras claimed - see last few posts). Curiouser and curiouser. And it leaves Greek citizens feeling as confused as ever. Greece's finance ministry is also briefing that a deal has been reached on its austerity package. Reuters has the story: Greece will tell a Euro Working Group meeting on Thursday that it has finalized an austerity package after lenders made additional concessions on labour reforms, the finance minister said on Wednesday. The government plans to submit two separate bills on austerity cuts and labour reforms to parliament next week, Yannis Stournaras said in comments confirmed by a finance ministry official. He did not provide further details. Stournaras has also been giving more details to MPs in Athens (see also 13.03). He's told them that Greece hopes cut its debt mountain by reducing the interest and extending the maturities of its bailout loans. But it needs the permission of its lenders - ie the troika. Stournaras said (via Reuters again): A debt haircut happens in two ways... The first is to lower the nominal value. If you do that unilaterally, nobody will ever lend you money again. The second way, which produces exactly the same result in terms of net present value, is to lower the interest and extend the repayment schedule... That is what we are asking for today. This all fits with the idea Greece getting a two-year extension to its bailout targets. But it's not clear that an agreement has been reached... Another twist in the Greek extension saga. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras has apparently declared that Greece has been granted an extra two years to hit its targets. Reuters reports that Stournaras gave Greek MPs the good news a little while ago. Here's the latest from the Reuters terminal: Greece's lender have given the country more time to meet its deficit targets under a 130-billion-euro bailout, the country's finance minister said on Wednesday. \"Today, we obtained the extension,\" Yiannis Stournaras told lawmakers. Greece has been seeking a two-year extension to its fiscal adjustment programme in order to soften the impact of a new round of austerity measures it is about to take under pressure from its EU and IMF lenders. And Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports that Stournaras has given similar information to journalists in Athens: \u201cThe package has been sealed,\u201d Stournaras is reported to have told journalists, less than 24 hours after coalition partners Democratic Left and PASOK expressed objections to some aspects of the measures. Democratic Left, the smallest of the three parties in the coalition, objected to some of the labor market reforms but it appears that a compromise with the troika has been found. Sources said that instead of reducing the notice companies have to give to employees before making them redundant from six to three months, a compromise has been reached on four months. Bloomberg's Michael McKee has a similar report: Suspect we'll only know officially once the full measures are agreed, ready to be delivered to parliament for a vote. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is due to start his session at the Bundestag anytime now. Draghi faces a tough session, with many German MPs concerned that the ECB's plan to buy the bonds of struggling eurozone countries in unlimited quantities will undermine its independence and potentially leave their taxpayers on the hook for losses in Spain and Italy. Disappointingly, the session is not being televised (this was the original plan). Instead, Draghi will hold a press conference with the president of the German lower house of parliament, Norbert Lammert, around 3pm BST (4pm local time). Russia cancelled a debt auction this morning, after investors demanded an unacceptably high return. It blamed wider jitters in the financial markets, as Reuters reports: The Russian Finance Ministry scrapped a weekly auction of 30 billion roubles ($955 million) of seven-year OFZ treasury bonds on Wednesday after yields on its debt spiked higher. The market correction led investors to seek a yield above the 7.12-7.17 percent range announced for the sale of February 2019 bonds, the ministry said in a statement. The European Commission has played down the report that Greece has apparently won its battle for a two-year extension to its austerity programme (see 10.36am). Olli Rehn's spokesman, Simon O'Connor, told reporters: I am not in a position to confirm anything in the report....There is no agreement yet. An extension (as predicted by S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung) would give Athens much-need time to implement labour market reforms and privatisation schemes. But as our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, points out, it will be costly: This extension throws up a funding gap of up to \u20ac18bn in 2013-14 alone, according to the unnamed sources talking to the German paper. There may be more funding to be filled for 2015-16, and it is still not clear how this gap is to be filled. The IMF and the Europeans have been arguing about it It seems clear, however, that Athens will get its \u20ac31.5bn disbursement by the end of next month in whatever form. The troika is expected to report that the IMF-set target of debt sustainability at 120% of GDP by 2020 cannot be met, raising questions of how the IMF will respond. Another day, another protest in Greece. Earlier today, members of the right-wing Independent Greeks party held a demonstration outside a debt collection agency in the Athens district of Tauros. Associated Press says they were protesting against the agency pursuing debts from \"Greeks who are economic hardship during the financial crisis\". Britain isn't immune to the tide of alarming data sweeping through the financial world today, with a new latest assessment of UK factory orders showing a shock fall. The CBI reported that British factories suffered a big drop in orders in October, with domestic orders down 10% and export orders 17% lower. The CBI's overall industrial trends survey came in at -3, its lowest level since last December. As with this morning's other disappointing data (see 10.57am onwards), the survey showed that weakness at home and abroad was to blame. Anna Leach, head of economic analysis at the CBI, commented: Domestic and overseas demand have both slipped unexpectedly this quarter, while output growth has tailed off. Sentiment regarding business conditions has also fallen back, particularly for exports. UK companies are increasingly concerned by political and economic conditions abroad, whether it is ongoing weakness and uncertainty in the Eurozone or the approaching fiscal cliff in the US. Leach added, though, that underlying conditions seem \"relatively stable\", with employment rising, and expectations for output and orders holding up well. Europe's manufacturing and service industries are also suffering a pretty dire month, according to the 'flash' estimate of output released this morning. Markit's composite PMI survey (which measures activity at around 5,000 eurozone firms) fell to 45.8, from 46.1. Any figure below 50 indicates a contraction, so the figures shows that the eurozone downturn is getting worse. This graph shows PMI tracked against GDP, and suggests a significant contraction is underway - perhaps 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the underlying business climate in the eurozone had deteriorated sharply in recent months: While GDP may decline only modestly in the third quarter, a steeper fall looks to be on the cards for the fourth quarter. The financial markets may have cheered the positive developments from policymakers in seeking to resolve the region\u2019s debt crisis, notably the promise of bond market intervention by the ECB, but business appears to have been less impressed. Williamson pointed out that sentiment about prospects for the year ahead is now the gloomiest since early-2009. The weakness in the global economy is a key factor: In addition to worries about the health of domestic markets, companies are also seeing demand weaken further afield, notably in Asia and, to a lesser extent, the US. And Germany saw its second consecutive monthly fall in employment since early 2010. There's a lot of pretty grim economic data around this morning, which I'll wrap up quickly now. German Business Confidence slides The IFO survey showed that confidence among German business leaders fell this month to its lowest level in two and a half years. It fell to 100.0, down from 101.4 in September, defying expectations of a rise to 101.6. The future expectations sub-index also fell, showing executives are more worried about growth prospects. The Munich-based IFO institute also warned that the \"clouds over the German economy are darkening\", and predicted stagnation in the last quarter of the year. City experts said the message from IFO was unremittingly downbeat: As ballymichael and northland have already flagged up in the comments below, there are reports in the German media this morning that Greece will receive the two-year extension it has been seeking. S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reports that Greece will be allowed until 2016 to bring its deficit below 3% of GDP and get its next aid tranche, worth \u20ac31.5bn, once it agrees the austerity measures demanded by the troika. Original article in German Google translation into English However... Jorg Asmussen (Germany's man on the ECB's executive board), has downplayed the report this morning, and warned that any such delay would mean more money, from somewhere... Asumssen told German public broadcaster ARD: So far there is no final agreement by the troika with the Greek government. We are making progress in Athens, but we are not there. If one were to stretch the fiscal targets by two years, it would mean the other euro zone states having to provide more financial means. But Greece is rumoured to be significantly off-track in hitting its debt targets (see: IMF and Europe in dangerous game of brinkmanship over failing Greek bailout). So one might conclude that either the debt targets must be extended or Greece's debt pile must be restructured in some way. Or both.... Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens that there is a sense of panic among government circles. Helena writes: Ta Nea this morning says it all. \"Dangerous Deadlock\", it declares. \"The next installation is up in the air after the veto.\" The leading daily points out that Antonis Samaras will likely be forced to forge ahead with a cabinet reshuffle - without the participation of the small Demcoratic Left party lead by Fotis Kouvellis, following the latter's steadfast refusal to accept further reforms in the labour market. Ta Nea opined: The ultimate effort to put out a government crisis of mega proportions has been underway since yesterday pm between the [headquarters of the coalition's participating parties] after the categoric refusal of Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvellis to accept a compromise solution with the troika over labour changes. As high-ranking government officials admitted late last night the troika's insistence and Kouvellis' veto at one minute to midnight changes everything and will now force Antonis Samaras to take other steps.... ...even if those steps are taken without the political and parliamentary support of the Democratic Left. With time of the absolute essence the coalition has to move doubly quickly if the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package and \"prior actions\" [i.e. structural reforms] required in return for further rescue loans are to be implemented in time for the next meeting of euro zone finance ministers on 12 November. Samaras has repeatedly said that public coffers will run dry by 16 November. The fact that the German finance ministry proposed the new clampdown on Greece's finances is causing particular unease today. As the Kathimerini newspaper writes: Germany is proposing that Greece give up more of its fiscal sovereignty and come under closer economic control, according to a document leaked on Tuesday. The German Finance Ministry proposals were made public by PASOK officials and made for controversial reading as they called for an escrow account into which Greece\u2019s bailout installments are paid to be transferred to the European Central Bank and for the account to also receive the tax revenues that Greece collects. And as one reader, equusmulusoctopus, points out, the loss of sovereignty implied by the measures is deeply concerning. It's actually worse than putting the country under receivership and more akin to directly governing it through troika-appointed czars. You can't get any closer than this to an occupation without actually rolling in with tanks. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports that today's talk shows are dominated by discussion of the \"unreasonable pressure\" which the troika is bringing to bear on Greece at the 11th hour. Some of the measures that are apparently being demanded (see 9.36am) have been talked about before - for example, the escrow account was raised back in February (see here). But the new proposal does appear to take more control away from Greece, especially as it is billed as an \"externally managed\" account, rather than falling under the control of the Bank of Greece. The suggestion that some Greek tax receipts should be funneled in is also new (I think). The other issue causing alarm in Greece this morning is a report that significant new controls are being demanded on the Greek budget in return for its next aid payment. The measures give the ECB, the EU and the IMF much tighter control of Greece's budgets, and have already aroused anger from people who see Greek sovereignty being undermined. These measures include: \u2022 the creation of an escrow account managed by an external body such as the European Central Bank. All aid payments will be placed in this account. More controversially, the measure also outlines that some Greek revenue will be directed straight into this account, once Greece has reached a primary surplus. \u2022 Should Greece miss its targets, the government would have to make sweeping cuts to all areas of official spending. \u2022 Greece could need \"external approval\" from a body such as the EU commission before it could borrow. This is described as being \"along the lines of supervision of regional or local authorities by some federal states\" - even though Europe is not (yet) a federation. \u2022 Greece will receive compulsory 'technical aid' to improve its tax collecting service, anti-corruption operations and privatisation programme. To Vima, the Greek newspaper, reports that the list was sent to Athens by the German finance ministry, and released by the Pasok party (a junior member of the coalition government). An English translation of the document has been uploaded to the web. It all adds up to further controls over Athens, and may fuel further protests against the country's direction. But given Greece's need for aid, Antonis Samaras may have no choice. Worth remembering, though, that Samaras has still not persuaded his coalition partners to back the plan. And even then, individual MPs have to approve it. With very many thanks to equusmulusoctopus, one of our regular readers. Although there have been rumours and leaks for the last four months, the 94-page draft memorandum that emerged overnight is the first time Greece's new austerity measures have been seen in full. We should caution that these details have not been officially released. Here's a list of the key points (via Ethnos) \u2022 Maintaining the emergency solidarity levy until 2018 - this is an increase in personal taxation of up to 5% that was introduced last year. \u2022 Lowering the number of income tax bands to three or four, from eight at present. \u2022 Big cuts to the public payroll: with 20,000 civil servants leaving in 2013, and a further 5,000 in 2014 \u2022 Increasing the retirement age by 2 years, from 65 to 67 \u2022 Increase in interest on deposits from 10% to 15% in 2014. \u2022 Eliminating various tax exemptions \u2022 Increasing taxes on farmers. \u2022 Retroactive reductions from 1 August 2012 to \"special payrolls\", on a sliding scale from 2% to 35%. \u2022 A huge cut in the the number of associate professors from 15,226 to 2,000. \u2022 Increasing urban traffic ticket prices by 25%, from March 2013. \u2022 Remove special seasonal unemployment benefit payments. The plans for civil service job cuts would see tens of thousands of people transferred into a \"labour pool\", with 5,000 being laid off each quarter until the troika's demands have been reached - according to a report on Skai News today. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. Important developments this morning in Greece, where details of the new austerity terms that are being demanded by its troika of lenders have emerged. The tough new measures include laying off up to 25,000 civil servants, hiking the retirement age to 67, and wide-ranging tax increases. The details hit the headlines after the country's three coalition leaders failed to agree on the country's austerity package last night. I'll pop the full list up shortly. There is also anger in Greece that the troika is demanding tougher controls on its budgets. This includes some Greek revenue being directed into a special escrow account (along with Greece's bailout aid), and conditions for \"horizontal\" spending cuts across the board if Greece fails to hit future targets. More on this to follow, too... The other big news story today is in Germany, where Mario Draghi is appearing before the Bundestag for a two-hour session, from 12.45pm BST (1.45pm CEST). A press conference is scheduled for 3pm BST (4pm CEST. And new economic data from Europe's manufacturing and services sectors are also being released this morning, along with UK business confidence data.",
