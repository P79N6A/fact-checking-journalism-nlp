      "bodyText": "There is a budding theme in the election campaign that the Labor party is \u201cat war with business\u201d because it will reject Coalition policy cutting company taxes and will hold a royal commission into the banking sector. But it\u2019s time to nip that false perception in the bud. The anti-business Labor hyperbole and the implied pro-business credentials of the Coalition flies in the face of the performance of the corporate sector when each side of politics has been in government over the past eight years. An anti-business government would drive business investment and company profits lower, while a pro-business government would do the opposite. Australian Bureau of Statistics data released over the past few days shed a stark light on private sector business investment and company profit trends over the past few years. It shows that rather than being anti-business, investment and profits boomed under Labor, and rather than being pro-business, they have collapsed under the Coalition. Here are the facts. In the two and a half years since the 2013 election, company profits have fallen 11% to their lowest level since 2010. This has occurred with the global economy registering decent growth and interest rates at record lows. In the six years of Labor government to 2013, company profits rose 28% despite the global financial crisis which plunged the world economy into a deep recession. On business investment, the credentials of both sides of politics are even more extreme. Since the September 2013 election, private sector capital expenditure has fallen a thumping 26% and the outlook for the next year is for a further fall of between 5% and 10%. The fall in business investment is set to be more severe than during the early 1990s recession. Under the previous Labor government, business investment rose a robust 67% to reach a record high proportion of GDP. It seems the policy settings which included the carbon price and mining tax did nothing to discourage the private sector from going out and investing. So much for Labor being anti-business with its emphasis on better health and education, and the Coalition being pro-business with its planned tax cuts. The election debate is framed as tax cuts being good for business, which of course is true. They will pay less tax on a given profit level and the cuts are simply a transfer of tax revenue to shareholders at a cost to the budget bottom line. Treasury modelling suggests GDP growth will be 0.1% higher as a result of these cuts, which means an almost zero impact on employment. What is ignored is the business benefit of Labor\u2019s plan to build a better educated and more highly skilled workforce. We would be less likely to see a repeat of the skills shortage that dogged the economy from 2005 to 2008 if workers had more skills and were better educated. Higher skills also equate to higher incomes and productivity. The OECD calculates that a fully educated workforce in Australia would add 2.8% to GDP over the medium term. Suffice to say, both sides of politics realise that the private sector is vital for economic and productivity growth. The fact that the business sector did so well under Labor and has been hammered by the Coalition suggests that Labor could be more pro-business than is assumed. After all, it did rescue the economy from recession with its fiscal stimulus when the GFC was in full swing. It is absurd to suggest Labor is anti-business, given the recent track record, but this will probably not stop those hankering for a Coalition election win from saying it as vocally and as often as possible, even though the facts suggest the opposite is more likely to be true.

    "webTitle": "'Bombshell' jobs report puts economic growth back in US election spotlight", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Back in 2012, the first Friday of the month was an exciting day in US politics. As Barack Obama and Mitt Romney fought to convince voters that they\u2019d be the best candidate to steer the US economy through recovery, the official monthly jobs report provided both sides with ammunition. Four years later, with the economy adding on average 200,000 jobs a month and the unemployment rate at 5%, down from 10% when Obama took office, those Fridays have come and gone without much to-do from those vying to be the next president. That is, until this week. A disappointing report announcing that the US economy had added just 38,000 jobs in May put the monthly statistic back into the US election spotlight just as Obama has spent the past few weeks trying to defend his economic legacy. \u201cTerrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!\u201d tweeted Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for president. \u201cDevastating jobs report showing weakest hiring in five years is a sign we need to move away from failed Obama policies [that] Clinton is promising to keep,\u201d tweeted Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. The Republicans also seized on the fact that the unemployment rate had dipped because 458,000 people left the labor force or gave up looking for work. Democrats are having none of it. \u201cWhen I hear Republicans complaining about the lower labor force participation rate \u2026 it\u2019s one thing to complain, it\u2019s another thing to do something about it. The most important thing to increase labor force participation is to pass federal paid leave because it would enable us to get more women in the workplace,\u201d the US labor secretary, Tom Perez, told the Guardian. The Obama administration was quick to point out that this is just one bad report. One bad report does not a recession make. Furthermore, they argued, overall the US economy continued to add jobs. \u201cWe don\u2019t get excited when the job numbers are better than expected and we don\u2019t get too disappointed when one month\u2019s job numbers are lower than expected,\u201d the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, told CNBC on Friday. Perez admitted that this report was \u201cclearly below expectation\u201d, but pointed out that one reason for the disappointing numbers was that about 40,000 Verizon workers had been on strike for 44 days. The strike ended last week. The US economy has now seen 75 consecutive months of private sector job growth and 65 weeks in a row where first-time claims for unemployment insurance came below 300,000, according to the US labor department. \u201cEven with last month\u2019s report, which was soft, we are averaging 150,000 jobs a month. What we are also seeing now is a pretty good evidence of increasing wages,\u201d said Perez. \u201cOur average hourly earning have increased 3.2% in an annual rate so far in 2016, which is undeniably better than 2015.\u201d Perez noted that he doesn\u2019t expect 2016 to be as good as 2015 in terms of job growth. \u201cThat\u2019s not a surprise and that\u2019s because as you get closer to the summit of full employment \u2013 and we are not at that summit yet \u2013 the steps that you take are shorter steps because you are climbing the tough part of the mountain,\u201d he said. The problem with this, however, is not the actual trends within the economy but how they are perceived by US voters. Certain trends or numbers amplified in election year can skew the perception of the actual state of the US economy. To Americans whose paychecks have not grown in years, statistics about average hourly earnings increasing by five cents a month mean little. It\u2019s the numbers they identify with that stand out. For example, there are 6.4 million Americans who are working part-time, but want full-time jobs. This past month, the number of such part-time workers went up by 468,000. More than 7.4 million Americans are currently working more than one job to make ends meet. That\u2019s up from 7 million a year ago. These are the numbers people remember \u2013 they know someone who is working two jobs. They know someone who wants more hours and cannot get them. These numbers also play into Trump\u2019s narrative \u2013 one of America that wants its jobs back from China and Mexico. By focusing his fire on the outsourcing plans of Mondelez, the maker of Oreos, and Carrier Corp, which manufactures air conditioners, Trump brought to the forefront another trend \u2013 one of a declining manufacturing industry. May saw job losses in mining and manufacturing. Manufacturing lost 18,000 jobs last month. Mining lost another 10,000 jobs in May. Since the industry peaked in 2014, it had lost 207,000 jobs overall, according to the US labor department. \u201cThe job losses in mining are an undeniable trend and they are a trend related to the fact that a gallon of gas costs a fraction of what it cost a few years ago,\u201d said Perez. \u201cFor consumers, that is a boom. That\u2019s equivalent to a tax cut of hundreds of dollars. For the industry, it has been obviously a challenge and we see it more now in the data over the period of roughly a year.\u201d As such, slowing job growth plays in Trump\u2019s favor while putting Obama on the defensive and potentially hurting Hillary Clinton, who has embraced Obama\u2019s economic legacy. \u201cIt allows Donald Trump to tout how he would do things differently as president and focus on some of the job creation plans he has,\u201d Republican strategist Ron Bonjean told Reuters. A recent Gallup survey of 1,530 adults revealed that economy remains a top concern for US voters. More than 90% of them said that economy was extremely important to them and 89% of them said the same of jobs and employment. One in five respondents chose the economy as the number one issue that they want the next president to address. The economy has manifestly improved under Obama\u2019s tenure. But the recession has left deep scars and a worried workforce that fears the worst is still to come. And the one yelling the loudest about it, for now, is Trump.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt was a strange mixture of a punch in the stomach and a relief,\u201d says one BHS shop worker describing the moment thousands of staff heard the retailer was heading for closure on Thursday afternoon. With just eight more weeks of pay promised as staff help sell the remains of BHS\u2019s stock, many workers feel sure they will be looking at a spell on benefits. They may not get more than the government-backed statutory pay-off of up to 12 weeks\u2019 pay or a maximum of \u00a35,748. If stores are sold, some may be transferred over to the new owners. One BHS staff member who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity said he had one colleague who was expecting a baby in a few months and did not know if she would receive maternity pay. Others who are now in their 50s and 60s and have worked for the company for more than 20 years are finding it hard to contemplate a life outside the womenswear department. \u201cEveryone is shell-shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if there are jobs available, it will be a real shock to some. It does become a family to people after a certain number of years as well as employment. It\u2019s like breaking up a family.\u201d The employee, who has worked at the retailer for seven years, was clear that most members of staff blame Sir Philip Green for the demise of their jobs and community. \u201cHe was at the helm for longer and a bigger chunk of the millions went into that black hole. Dominic Chappell took control of an already crashing vehicle.\u201d He added that the stores became increasingly dilapidated during his time at BHS. \u201cThe lifts were constantly broken down and we never had air conditioning. I\u2019ve seen shoppers walk in for 30 seconds and walk out again because of the lack of air con. We always looked like we were on the way down,\u201d he said. \u201cThere seemed to be plenty of money floating around in certain circles but there was not much on the shopfloor.\u201d When Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions bought the business for \u00a31 in March last year, staff were kept on after hours to hear a presentation promising new investment and big changes. \u201cWe were promised a great turnaround ... that everything was going to be fine and dandy. But we could see that wasn\u2019t happening,\u201d the employee said. Many staff felt the new owners\u2019 continuation of Green\u2019s experiment in introducing groceries to stores was \u201cjust bizarre\u201d and money would have been better spent on improving the areas which shoppers already appreciated in BHS, such as lighting, homewares or women\u2019s clothing. As soon as Retail Acquisitions took over, it became obvious that bits of stock which had historically been reliable sellers were no longer available as suppliers pulled out because fearing they might not be paid. When it was announced BHS was going into administration on 25 April, the employee said staff were upset and there were tears on the shopfloor but there was still some hope. \u201cAt first there appeared to be a cast list of many bidders and some white knights but, as things dragged on, we started to think that was strange and that it was taking so long given there was apparently so many wonderful bidders.\u201d As negotiations continued and bidders came and went, he said staff resigned themselves to the fact that the business was likely to be closed down. \u201cEvery time the deadline was pushed back, we felt like we were being fobbed off. It seemed like a decision had been made some time ago,\u201d he said. While administrators say they are still looking for a potential deal, even as they wind down the business and sell off stock, the employee said the biggest hope of the workers is that they will get paid. \u201cWe\u2019re not feeling terribly trusting of anybody at the moment but we\u2019ll have to take them at their word.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mike Coupe, the boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, enjoyed a 86% rise in his annual pay package to \u00a32.8m last year despite a fall in underlying profits. The supermarket chief executive\u2019s pay was boosted by a \u00a3767,000 bonus, his first as head of the company after he missed out in 2015, according to the company\u2019s annual report published on Friday. Coupe received an annual salary of \u00a3916,000, a long-term share bonus of \u00a3806,000 which he will not be able to cash in until 2018, and benefits of \u00a338,000 including a one-off \u00a321,160 payment for \u201ccosts incurred as a result of company commitments\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s declined to reveal exactly what the special benefit payment was for. Sainsbury\u2019s said Coupe had earned the annual bonus, which was 76% of the maximum possible, after hitting profit, sales and customer service measures as well as personal targets including accelerating the move into online sales by securing a \u00a31.4bn deal to buy Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos. The company\u2019s remuneration committee said in the annual report: \u201cThe committee acknowledges the absolute year-on-year decline in profit and [underlying] sales but is comfortable that the targets were robustly set, particularly when the broader context of the retail market and Sainsbury\u2019s outperformance of our main supermarket peers is considered.\u201d The revelations on Coupe\u2019s pay come after Sainsbury\u2019s revealed a 14% drop in underlying annual profits to \u00a3587m in the year to 12 March as it was forced to slash prices to compete with the rise of the discounters. Sales fell 1.1% to \u00a325.8bn in the year. But including one-off items such as property profits and write-downs, Sainsbury\u2019s returned to the black with a profit of \u00a3548m, after a \u00a372m loss last year. Shop floor staff were handed a 4% pay rise last year \u2013 but there have also been hundreds of redundancies as the retailer cuts costs as part of its fightback against the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl. For the coming year, Coupe and Sainsbury\u2019s finance director, John Rogers, have been handed a 1.5% rise in basic salary to \u00a3929,486 and \u00a3685,125 respectively. Last July, Rogers\u2019 salary was increased to \u00a3675,000 from \u00a3610,500, after his responsibilities were broadened to include group strategy, Sainsbury\u2019s online store and its nascent joint venture with discounter Netto. His total pay package rose 70% to \u00a31.8m as he secured a \u00a3472,000 annual bonus and a \u00a3486,000 deferred share bonus that cannot be cashed in until 2018. He also took home \u00a317,000 in benefits, including a car allowance. Sainsbury\u2019s board has decided to delay setting targets for directors\u2019 bonuses in the year ahead until after its anticipated takeover of Home Retail Group is completed.

    "webTitle": "Former BHS owner sent abusive message to chief exec after chain collapsed", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, sent an abusive text message to the chief executive of the retailer just hours after administrators announced that it would close all its shops. Chappell described Darren Topp as a \u201cfucking prick\u201d in the message and blamed him and Michael Hitchcock, BHS\u2019s former finance consultant, for the demise of the business. The text message highlights the breakdown in relationship between the key players in the scandal. When contacted by the Guardian over the message, Chappell said he \u201cmeant absolutely every word\u201d and claimed that Topp and Sir Philip Green \u201chave driven this company to liquidation\u201d. In the message to Topp, Chappell wrote: \u201cWell done. I hope you and Michael are happy that you got the out come [sic] you wanted. You fucking prick.\u201d A spokesman for BHS said the text message was a \u201cnew low\u201d for Chappell and that he is a \u201cfantasist\u201d. The message was sent on Thursday evening, three hours after administrators said they had failed to secure a rescue deal for the 88-year-old business, its 163 stores, and 11,000 staff. Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrator, is now looking for buyers for BHS stores, the brand and its international business. Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct and discount chain Primark are among the retailers looking at buying shops. Green is under growing pressure to give up his company\u2019s claim to \u00a335m from the administration. Arcadia is a secured creditor to BHS along with HSBC, Barclays, Gordon Brothers and Grovepoint, who are owned about \u00a3120m in total. The secured creditors are ahead of employees, suppliers, landlords, and HMRC in the queue to be paid any proceeds from the sale of assets. The unsecured creditors, including the BHS pension scheme, are owed as much as \u00a31.3bn. Lord Myners, the former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, called on Green to take responsibility for the collapse of BHS by forgoing his position at the front of the creditors\u2019 queue. \u201cHe could give up that security and make sure the money is used for the benefit of the employees and pensioners and not claim to be in the front of the queue,\u201d Myners told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. The head of the Institute of Directors, Simon Walker, accused Green of a \u201clamentable failure of behaviour\u201d and called the downfall of BHS a \u201cblight on the reputation of British business\u201d. He added: \u201cSerious questions need to be asked of almost everybody concerned in the running of BHS, the sale, and the company\u2019s demise.\u201d Chappell, who will answer questions from MPs next Wednesday over the scandal, repeated his claims that Green could have helped to save BHS. He said: \u201cThis company was totally and utterly saveable. It was through the actions of Philip and Darren Topp that it went into administration, and it was the actions of Philip and Darren that have caused this liquidation. \u201cThe only person that had a qualifying floating charge was Philip and he called the shots. He could have reduced or helped or backed up one of the bids going through to save 11,000 jobs and he didn\u2019t. I think the deals on the table were good enough to save the company but it was Philip pushing for his \u00a335m.\u201d Chappell, who said he was working on a bid for BHS\u2019s international business, added: \u201cI meant absolutely every word I said in that text to Darren. He and Philip have driven this company to liquidation. This company could have been saved if Philip helped us on the way through, instead of continuously hindering us. Darren was Philip\u2019s pony, he played Philip\u2019s tune continuously.\u201d When asked how felt about 11,000 people losing their job, Chappell said: \u201cHideous. I can\u2019t sleep at night. I am sick to my stomach with it. It didn\u2019t need to be this way. It has been driven into the rocks by Darren fucking Topp and Philip Green.\u201d Given the opportunity to apologise, he said: \u201cI will make my position very clear on Wednesday.\u201d A BHS spokesman said: \u201cThis is a new low for Dominic Chappell, proving once again he is a fantasist. Anyone with a conscience who has taken millions out of a failing business, leading to the loss of thousands of jobs, would hang their head in in shame, not send abusive text messages.\u201d A source close to the administration denied that Green had prevented a rescue deal, saying the tycoon had gone \u201cballistic\u201d when he found out that BHS would be wound down. Arcadia declined to comment. The source said that the deal fell apart after a Portuguese-backed consortium led by Greg Tufnell, the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, failed to pay the \u00a330m sale price by the deadline of Thursday morning. MPs on the work and pensions committee and the business, skills and innovation committee published further evidence on Friday relating to their investigation into the collapse of BHS. They raise further questions about why Green sold the company to Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt three times. Paul Budge, Arcadia\u2019s finance director, told parliament last week that \u00a3120m had been made available to Retail Acquisitions by Farallon, a San Francisco-based hedge fund that invests in the debt of distressed businesses. He said the credit facility made available by Farallon was important because it showed Retail Acquisitions had the funding to run BHS and \u201ctheir intentions were serious in that they wanted to run the business as a going concern\u201d. But written evidence from Goldman Sachs\u2019s Anthony Gutman, who gave informal advice to Arcadia, shows the banker had several reservations about Farallon\u2019s funding, not least that \u201cit was not clear that Farallon understood the existence of a pension deficit\u201d. His detailed notes on the interaction between Green, Budge, Chappell and their advisers, which run from October 2014 until about a week before the deal was completed in March 2015, show that Green\u2019s team twice called off the deal because of concerns about the buyers\u2019 credibility and funding. It does not shed light on why the deal went ahead despite concerns. Frank Field, chairman of the work and pension committee, said the information raised a number of questions including why a bid backed by Farallon\u2019s money had become the preferred deal despite concerns about their backing.",

    "webTitle": "Shock US jobs report as payrolls growth lowest for more than 5 years - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The poor US jobs figures only add to the concerns about the country\u2019s economy, which may still be too weak for a rate rise. That is the view expressed by Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard in a speech in Washington. She said the non-farm payroll numbers suggested that the US labour market had slowed, and added that any rate rise should also wait until it was clearer that China and Europe are doing better, and the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership was out of the way. She said: Recognising the data we have on hand for the second quarter is quite mixed and still limited, and there is important near-term uncertainty, there would appear to be an advantage to waiting until developments provide greater confidence. Prudent risk-management would suggest the risks from waiting until the totality of the data provides greater confidence in a rebound in domestic activity, and there is greater certainty regarding the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote, seem lower than the risks associated with moving ahead of these developments. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. US energy companies added 9 oil rigs last week, bringing the total rig count up to 325 according to the latest Baker Hughes report. This is only the second time this year the rig count has gone up, and then it was only one rig in the middle of March. It comes as oil hit $50 a barrel despite this week\u2019s Opec meeting failing to agree an output ceiling. The number of gas rigs fell however, making a total increase of four rigs: The disappointing non-farm payroll numbers gave a shock to investors who were expecting a calm end to the week, sending stock markets sharply lower, hitting the dollar and prompting a spate of bond buying. There was a two way pull between those who saw the job figures as positive, in that they would prevent the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates this month, and those who worried about the signs of a weak US economy. By the close of trade in Europe, the former had regained some ground and markets recovered from their worst levels. Indeed UK shares, supported by rises in commodity companies as oil held fairly steady during the day, managed to end up in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 24.02 points or 0.39% at 6209.63 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.03% to 10,103.26 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.99% at 4421.78 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.53% to 17,495.09 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.74% lower at 8801.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.48% to 648.63 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down just 39 points or 0.23%. Back with the US jobs: Friday rating agency update: S&amp;P said: We expect the new minority government in Ireland to keep pursuing open and proactive economic policies and continue fiscal consolidation. Thanks to rapid nominal GDP growth, we expect net general government debt to decline to below 80% of GDP in 2017. We are therefore affirming our \u2018A+/A-1\u2019 sovereign credit ratings on Ireland. The stable outlook balances our view of upside potential for the ratings if Ireland\u2019s fiscal position continues to improve against risks associated with external factors such as a potential Brexit, or weaker global demand. Bond prices rose and yields fell as investors looked for havens after the shock US jobs numbers. In the UK, 30 year yields fell to 2.084% after the US data, the lowest level since February 2015. Germany\u2019s 10 year Bund yield fell to 0.073%, its lowest this year. The poor jobs numbers following various hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve members make chair Janet Yellen\u2019s speech on Monday evening a potentially tricky affair. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: Over the last month it became apparent that the US Federal Reserve was unhappy that the market refused to price in the prospect of a summer rate hike. Consequently, over the past few weeks we saw a confusion of Fed Heads come out to declare that their conditions for monetary tightening were being met. Some were claiming that two, three or even four rate hikes were possible in 2016 \u2013 a ludicrous proposition given the few windows available due to the US Presidential Election, let alone the uncertain outlook for the US and global economies. This constant barrage of hawkishness pressed the markets to sharply cut the odds on a summer rate hike. This led to a rally in the dollar together with a nasty and protracted sell-off in precious metals. That\u2019s all been reversed now thanks to today\u2019s payroll release. On Monday evening (17:30BST) Yellen is scheduled to speak about the economic outlook and monetary policy. It will be very interesting to hear what she has to say in the light of the jobs data. We can\u2019t blame the Fed for weak data. But we can take them to task for their relentless effort to tell the market it was pricing financial assets incorrectly. The US Federal Reserve exerts too much influence over the markets these days and many investors will now believe that the Fed has taken them for a ride. Yellen is going to find it very difficult to winch back credibility for the central bank now. A week ago Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen was at Harvard suggesting a summer interest rate rise could on the cards. Now, after the poor jobs figures, maybe not: The disappointing US services sector data which followed quickly on from the poor jobs numbers provides another reason for the Federal Reserve to leave rates unchanged this month, says James Smith at ING Bank: After May\u2019s non-farm payrolls plummeted, the ISM Non-manufacturing came crashing back down to 52.9 from 55.7, much lower than expected. Aside from supplier deliveries, the other main components that contribute to the headline recorded fairly sizable falls (employment and business activity), particularly new orders, where the size of the month-on-month drop was the largest since November 2008. This is especially concerning, given that in theory it sets the precedent for (or \u201cleads\u201d) future business activity. Although the ISM surveys are perhaps not the most central part of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee reaction function, the magnitude of the fall means that it will probably feature in the debate over near-term policy. Indeed, given that the US recession story has faded away over recent weeks, it is possible that the combination of today\u2019s weak non-farm payrolls figure and the drop in the ISM Non-manufacturing prompts the debate to resurface to some degree over coming weeks. Either way, it is another reason for the FOMC to leave rates unchanged in June, with focus now on Chair Yellen\u2019s speech on Monday to see how the latest data will affect policy in coming months. Still, US factory orders were more or less in line with expectations: More signs of weakness in the US economy, this time from two surveys of the service sector. First the ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell from 55.7 in April to 52.9, well below the consensus forecast of 55.5. The new orders index at 54.2, down from 59.9, was the lowest since February 2014. And the final reading of the Markit services PMI for May came in at 51.3, down from 52.8 in April. The index is marginally higher that the first estimate of 51.2 for May. Meanwhile the Markit composite index - manufacturing and services - fell from 52.4 in April to 50.9. Here\u2019s a chart showing the jobs numbers: And unemployment rate Joey Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: The jobs report was bad, bad, bad: there is no positive spin to it. Not only was May a particularly weak month, the worst in almost six years, but revisions dragged previous months lower. The unemployment rate declined to 4.7% but that is because of a fall in the labour force participation rate: not what we want to see happening. Overall, the job market has added an average of 116,000 jobs/month over the past three months, a substantial slowdown from the 229,000/month averaged in 2015. What is the reason? The Verizon strike certainly weighed on the May numbers, so we can expect a bounce back in June. And as the US approaches full employment, the rate of job creation was always going to slow. This does not seem to be indicative of a broader economic slowdown: in April consumer spending rose by 1%, the largest monthly increase since 2009. The labour market slowdown will make the Federal Reserve reconsider its next move. It reduces the chance of a June rate increase and makes it more likely the Fed will wait until July, after the Brexit vote, which will also reduce the political risk from abroad. More reaction to the disappointing jobs figures. CEBR added its voice to those suggesting a US rate rise in June was now off the table. Senior economist Alasdair Cavalla said: [The report] does support our assessment that now is still too early for another rise. The main factor slowing down growth in the US is exports, which is precisely where the impact of tightening will fall most heavily in the form of a stronger dollar. Fed officials have explicitly highlighted a potential Brexit as another downside risk likely to stay its hand in June. This comes on top of a still fragile global economic environment. Today\u2019s news suggests there may be more to worry about than thought. A good year economically is thought to favour incumbent governments; the risk of a protectionist and isolationist administration by the end of the year is hardly going to give firms the reassurance they need to hire and invest. In the absence of any meaningful inflationary threat, raising interest rates in such an environment would be incomprehensible. And: And here\u2019s a possible explanation for the shock figures: The weaker than expected US jobs numbers have also sent European markets lower. Germany\u2019s Dax is now down 0.8% while France\u2019s Cac is 0.78% lower. The FTSE 100 is just managing to stay in positive territory, up 4.5 points. The dollar has fallen to a two week low on the basis that the figures make a June rate rise unlikely now, despite the previous hints to the contrary from various Fed members. The dollar index dropped by more than 1% while the euro rose 1.3% and sterling hit a three day high of 1.4544. Wall Street is down in early trading following those horrible payrolls numbers - the worst in almost six years. Dow Jones: -0.3% at 17,780 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,101 Nasdaq: -0.3% at 4,958 Investors will be weighing up whether it\u2019s plain bad news (weak employment market) or good bad news (US rate hike delayed because of weak employment market). The biggest increase in jobs was in the healthcare sector, with 46,000 jobs added in May, while employment in professional and business services was up by 10,000. Mining, manufacturing and construction were among the sectors where jobs fell. Economists said a US rate hike in June - previously considered a strong possibility - was now unlikely because of the unexpectedly weak payrolls. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics: The 38,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in May, which is still only 73,000 if we adjust for the 35,000 striking Verizon workers, means that a June rate hike from the Fed is now very unlikely. In addition, the gains in the preceding two months were revised down by a cumulative 59,000. A July hike is still possible, but it would require clear evidence of a rebound in June\u2019s payroll figures (and a UK vote to remain in the European Union). That sound you hear is Fed Chair Janet Yellen furiously re-writing her speech that she is scheduled to give on Monday. James Smith, economist at ING: Over recent weeks, the blocks appeared to have been gradually falling into place for another rate hike from the Fed, but the latest labour report has potentially put a large spanner in the works. In our opinion, this may well put the final nail in the coffin for a June hike, with confirmation of this potentially coming from Chair Yellen\u2019s speech on Monday. Donald Trump has given his verdict on the shockingly weak payrolls numbers: May\u2019s US jobs numbers were always going to be affected by a strike among Verizon workers, but they do not account for such a huge drop in payrolls (to 38k). As Jana Kasperkevic from the Guardian\u2019s New York office explains: A strike by 40,000 Verizon workers impacted the numbers, the labor department said, and without the strike the number of jobs added would have been 72,000, which is still less than a half of expect job growth. Looking at the detail of the US jobs numbers, wage growth was in line with expectations at 0.2% in May. The unemployment rate eased to 4.7% from 5% in April, although the drop was partly explained by people who stopped looking for work and were therefore no longer classed as unemployed. From the US Labor Department report: In May, 1.7m persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little changed from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. Among the marginally attached, there were 538,000 discouraged workers in May, essentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. Manufacturing payrolls fell by 10,000 after rising by a (downwardly revised) 2,000 a month earlier. US futures dropped after the shock payrolls figures. On the one hand, it makes the prospect of a rate rise at the FOMC\u2019s June meeting less likely. But on the other, it suggests the labour market in the world\u2019s largest economy is weaker than assumed. Here is the full story from our US team. This is a huge miss on US jobs, as companies dramatically slowed their hiring in May. Payrolls rose by just 38,000 in May, the slowest rate of growth since September 2010. This should get the member\u2019s of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting FOMC scratching their heads... Breaking: US non-farm payrolls have come in way below expectations. There were 38,000 jobs added in May, compared with expectations of a 164,000 increase. April\u2019s number has been revised down too - to 123,000 from an earlier estimate of 160,000. More soon.... Earlier, there were some disappointing eurozone retail sales figures. Instead of the expected 0.3% month on month rise in April, sales were flat due to falls in Germany and Belgium in the wake of the Brussels terror attacks. This follows a 0.6% fall in the overall eurozone figure in March. The year on year rise in April was 1.4%, below forecasts of a 1.9% increase. The figures could point to slower GDP growth in the second quarter, analysts believe. The rise in the FTSE 100 today means after a volatile few months, the index is more or less back where it began the year. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has this take on the markets: Having started the day strong a far better than expected services PMI (at 53.5 against the 52.5 forecast) ensured the FTSE continued to grow this Friday, the UK index rising by nearly 1%. While not quite as enthusiastic as the FTSE, the Eurozone indices nevertheless pushed forth with a near half a percent rise this Friday despite a fairly dismal morning for data. Unsurprisingly the Dow Jones couldn\u2019t quite join in with Europe\u2019s rebound this Friday morning, the index\u2019s futures resolute in their flatness ahead of this afternoon\u2019s jobs report. With June\u2019s Fed meeting less than a fortnight away today\u2019s non-farm number is arguably the most important since last December. An update on how the other major markets in Europe are doing: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.6% at 10,266 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 4,487 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.03% at 8,955 The FTSE 100 is up 1% or 62 points at 6,248. It is the biggest riser among the major European indices. Investors are no doubt relieved that the UK services PMI did not deliver a nasty shock, but markets are also being boosted by the resilience of oil prices. Brent crude is hovering just above $50 a barrel despite the stalemate at Thursday\u2019s Opec meeting in Vienna. In a couple of hours we will have May\u2019s non-farm payroll report from the US, which always has the potential to move markets. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting payrolls to jump by 164,000, following a 160,000 rise in April. CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson: European markets have got off to a positive start ahead of this afternoon\u2019s keenly awaited US jobs data. Investors could do with some good news this week given that we\u2019ve seen declines every day this week for the FTSE 100, despite the fact that the oil price looks on course for its fourth successive week of gains, with Brent prices looking to gain a foothold above $50 a barrel. It is expected that the US economy will have added 160k new jobs in May, while the unemployment rate is expected to drop to 4.9%. If the jobs number drops sharply to 130k or anywhere near that - quite possible given the Verizon strikes and the slowdown in manufacturing hiring - then any prospect of a move in rates in June, already seen as fairly low could well diminish further. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, is the latest business leader to issue a dire warning on the potential consequences of Brexit. Addressing the bank\u2019s staff in Bournemouth, alongside the chancellor and remain campaigner George Osborne, Dimon said: I think it would be a terrible deal for the British economy and jobs. I don\u2019t know if it means 1,000 jobs [would go at JP Morgan], 2,000 jobs, it could be as many as 4,000 jobs. And they would be jobs all around the UK. I don\u2019t want you to worry about it but when you vote you should be thinking about something like this. Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve has been speaking in London about the possible timing of US interest rate hikes. He said there was a \u201creasonable case\u201d for delaying rate rises until core inflation reaches the Fed\u2019s 2% target. On current forecasts, that wouldn\u2019t be until 2018. However, Evans said that as things stood, it was likely the Fed would vote for two rate hikes before the end of 2016, taking borrowing costs to a range between 0.75% and 1%. Speaking at the Global Interdependence Center in London, he said: Frankly, I\u2019m really of two minds at the moment, and I expect to take this quandary with me into the next FOMC meeting. On the one hand, under the committee\u2019s current approach to renormalizing policy, I think it may be appropriate to have two 25 basis point moves between now and the end of the year. I see the value in making small and gradual adjustments to the fed funds rate as the data improve and confirm my positive baseline outlook for the US. And this is my base-case view of appropriate policy. On the other hand, if I think outside of the baseline, I also think that a reasonable case can be made for holding off increasing the funds rate until core inflation actually gets to 2% on a sustainable basis. In other UK news, Sir Philip Green has received more criticism over BHS - the high street retail chain he sold for \u00a31 last year that has now collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs. Simon Walker, the head of the Institute of Directors accused Green of a \u201clamentable failure of behaviour\u201d that risked \u201cdeeply damaging\u201d the British business world as a whole. He told BBC radio 4: Sir Philip Green is a very high-profile business leader. He is the person who is on the front page with Kate Moss on his arm and who has a \u00a3100m superyacht and so on. When someone like this ends up behaving like this, people think that\u2019s how business is, and it\u2019s not. The majority of business leaders are people who are more likely to have mortgaged their homes to keep their company going than to own this kind of lavish thing. Read our full story here. Green will face questions by MPs on 15 June over his role in the demise of BHS. Here is the breakdown of how UK services companies felt their businesses were being affected by the looming possibility of Brexit... Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson, was not overly cheered by the better-than-expected services PMI number for the UK. He says that taking into account all the data for the second quarter so far, growth is on course to halve between April and June, following 0.4% growth in the first quarter. The PMI surveys show that the pace of economic growth remained subdued in May, as Brexit worries exacerbated existing headwinds. The data so far indicate that the second quarter is likely to see the economy grow by just 0.2%. Growth has collapsed in manufacturing and construction, leaving the economy dependent on the service sector to sustain the upturn, though even here the pace of expansion has remained frustratingly weak so far this year. The detail of the PMI survey showed that UK services sector companies took on workers at the slowest rate in more than three years. The better-than-expected UK services PMI should come as a relief to investors. A weaker number for May would have started to build a more worrying picture of how the UK economy is performing in the second quarter. The big fear is that if Britain votes to leave the EU when it goes to the polls on 23 June, the UK will slide back into recession at a time when the economy is not fully healed following the last crisis. In May\u2019s PMI, Markit asked UK services companies an additional question: \u201cPlease state the extent to which the issue of the UK\u2019s potential exit from the EU is currently affecting your business.\u201d Of those taking part in the survey, 28% said a potential Brexit was having a detrimental impact on business, while 9% said it was having a strongly detrimental impact. On the flip side, 51% said it was having no significant effect. Breaking: The UK services sector grew at a faster rate than expected in May. The headline index on the Markit/CIPS PMI increased to 53.5 from 52.3 in April. Economists were expecting a smaller rise to 52.5. Anything above 50 indicates expansion. So Italy let the side down on an otherwise positive set of services PMIs for the eurozone. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said combined with the manufacturing surveys published earlier in the week, the latest PMIs suggested the eurozone economy was moving along at a sluggish pace. He suggested the growth of 0.5% achieved in the first quarter would not be sustained into the second: The final PMI numbers for May have come in slightly ahead of the earlier flash readings, but still point a eurozone economy which seems unable to move out of low gear. The survey data are signalling a GDP rise of 0.3% in the second quarter, suggesting the growth spurt seen at the start of the year will prove frustratingly short-lived. The eurozone\u2019s services sector expanded at the fastest rate in three months in May, boosted by growth in Germany, France, Spain and Ireland. The headline index measuring activity on the Markit PMI survey edged up to 53.3 last month from 53.1 in April. Employment in the eurozone\u2019s services industry increased for a nineteenth month, with jobs created at the fastest rate in Germany and Ireland. Italy\u2019s services sector fared less well than its neighbours in the single currency bloc, with the headline index pointing to a contraction in activity in May. All major indices are higher this morning after Wall Street closed up last night. Investors are holding their nerve so far. There were no nasty shocks on Thursday from the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting of the governing council in Vienna, where all policy measures were left on hold. Activity in Spain\u2019s services sector grew at an accelerated pace in May according to the Markit PMI survey. The headline index increased to 55.4 from 55.1 in April. It was better than the 53.5 forecast by economists, and will no doubt be a source of relief for investors following weaker manufacturing numbers earlier in the week. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the PMI report, said: Following on from Wednesday\u2019s disappointing Spain manufacturing PMI numbers, the latest services data are something of a relief, with growth in activity and new business ticking up slightly. The figures provide hope that the sector will be able to successfully weather headwinds such as a weak global environment and domestic political instability and remain in growth territory in the near-term at least. Brent crude oil has edged higher this morning, up 0.3% at $50.2 a barrel. It appears that a stalemate at Opec\u2019s meeting in Vienna on Thursday - where Tehran refused to support a plan by Riyadh and others to freeze their crude output - has been partially offset by the latest US stockpiles data. US crude stockpiles fell 1.4m barrels last week, reducing supplies for a second week according to the figures from the Energy Information Administration. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s all eyes on the service sector this morning as the PMI reports for May are published for the UK and the eurozone. In the UK, the Markit/CIPS report will be closely watched by investors looking for clues on how the wider economy is doing in the second quarter. Economists are predicting the monthly survey will paint a stable picture of the the sector, which accounts for more than three quarters of the UK economy. The headline index is predicted to rise to edge up to 52.5 in May from 52.3 in April, where anything above 50 signals an expansion in activity. If the number comes in below that, investor nerves - already shot in the run up to the EU referendum - are likely to rise. As Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets, puts it: We\u2019ll get further colour on whether the UK economy has hit a partially self-inflicted slump brought about by all the hysteria surrounding the upcoming referendum vote. A poor number here could well raise concerns about a potential negative quarter for the UK economy, in the process increasing speculation about a possible rate cut by the Bank of England. What was that about a possible DIY recession? Also coming up..... We will get the eurozone services PMIs, and this afternoon the closely watched non-farm payrolls report will be published in the US. Will the jobs report make the Fed more likely or less likely to raise US interest rates in the near future? We will bring you all the reaction.",

David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the last month it became apparent that the US Federal Reserve was unhappy that the market refused to price in the prospect of a summer rate hike. Consequently, over the past few weeks we saw a confusion of Fed Heads come out to declare that their conditions for monetary tightening were being met. Some were claiming that two, three or even four rate hikes were possible in 2016 \u2013 a ludicrous proposition given the few windows available due to the US Presidential Election, let alone the uncertain outlook for the US and global economies.</p> <p>This constant barrage of hawkishness pressed the markets to sharply cut the odds on a summer rate hike. This led to a rally in the dollar together with a nasty and protracted sell-off in precious metals. That\u2019s all been reversed now thanks to today\u2019s payroll release.</p> <p>On Monday evening (17:30BST) Yellen is scheduled to speak about the economic outlook and monetary policy. It will be very interesting to hear what she has to say in the light of the jobs data. We can\u2019t blame the Fed for weak data. But we can take them to task for their relentless effort to tell the market it was pricing financial assets incorrectly. The US Federal Reserve exerts too much influence over the markets these days and many investors will now believe that the Fed has taken them for a ride. Yellen is going to find it very difficult to winch back credibility for the central bank now. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f174ac4bd4175616f772f2a16f195c55932052c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f174ac4bd4175616f772f2a16f195c55932052c/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yellen hinting at summer rate rises last week at Harvard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yellen hinting at summer rate rises last week at Harvard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57519acae4b045bc9189e486\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-03T14:59:22.116Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/27/markets-us-growth-figures-janet-yellen-putin-greece-live\">A week ago</a></strong> Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen was at Harvard suggesting a summer interest rate rise could on the cards.

Aside from supplier deliveries, the other main components that contribute to the headline recorded fairly sizable falls (employment and business activity), particularly new orders, where the size of the month-on-month drop was the largest since November 2008. This is especially concerning, given that in theory it sets the precedent for (or \u201cleads\u201d) future business activity. </p> <p>Although the ISM surveys are perhaps not the most central part of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee reaction function, the magnitude of the fall means that it will probably feature in the debate over near-term policy. Indeed, given that the US recession story has faded away over recent weeks, it is possible that the combination of today\u2019s weak non-farm payrolls figure and the drop in the ISM Non-manufacturing prompts the debate to resurface to some degree over coming weeks. Either way, it is another reason for the FOMC to leave rates unchanged in June, with focus now on Chair Yellen\u2019s speech on Monday to see how the latest data will affect policy in coming months. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57518fdce4b045bc9189e437\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-03T14:11:07.502Z\">3.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still, US factory orders were more or less in line with expectations:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SigmaSquawk/status/738733774737924098\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US Factory Orders Data (Apr)<br>Factory Orders M/M +1.9% v +1.9% exp, prev +1.1% rev +1.7%<br>Ex Transportation M/M +0.5%, prev +0.8% rev +1.0%</p>&mdash; Sigma Squawk (@SigmaSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SigmaSquawk/status/738733774737924098\">June 3, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-03T14:11:16.657Z\">at 3.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57518ca5e4b0efb101874152\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-03T14:07:09.117Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US service sector growth slows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More signs of weakness in the US economy, this time from two surveys of the service sector.</p> <p>First the ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell from 55.7 in April to 52.9, well below the consensus forecast of 55.5.

Not only was May a particularly weak month, the worst in almost six years, but revisions dragged previous months lower. The unemployment rate declined to 4.7% but that is because of a fall in the labour force participation rate: not what we want to see happening. Overall, the job market has added an average of 116,000 jobs/month over the past three months, a substantial slowdown from the 229,000/month averaged in 2015.</p> <p>What is the reason? The Verizon strike certainly weighed on the May numbers, so we can expect a bounce back in June. And as the US approaches full employment, the rate of job creation was always going to slow. This does not seem to be indicative of a broader economic slowdown: in April consumer spending rose by 1%, the largest monthly increase since 2009. </p> <p>The labour market slowdown will make the Federal Reserve reconsider its next move. It reduces the chance of a June rate increase and makes it more likely the Fed will wait until July, after the Brexit vote, which will also reduce the political risk from abroad.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57518b4ae4b09769a0d1bf88\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-03T13:54:02.083Z\">2.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More reaction to the disappointing jobs figures.</p> <p>CEBR added its voice to those suggesting a US rate rise in June was now off the table. Senior economist Alasdair Cavalla said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The report] does support our assessment that now is still too early for another rise. The main factor slowing down growth in the US is exports, which is precisely where the impact of tightening will fall most heavily in the form of a stronger dollar. Fed officials have explicitly highlighted a potential Brexit as another downside risk likely to stay its hand in June. This comes on top of a still fragile global economic environment. Today\u2019s news suggests there may be more to worry about than thought. A good year economically is thought to favour incumbent governments; the risk of a protectionist and isolationist administration by the end of the year is hardly going to give firms the reassurance they need to hire and invest. In the absence of any meaningful inflationary threat, raising interest rates in such an environment would be incomprehensible.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/738719922319183872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May 27: Yellen says rate hikes in coming months &quot;appropriate&quot;<br><br>June 3: 38k May payrolls<br><br>June 6: Yellen to repeat &quot;appropriate&quot;?

      "bodyText": "Airlines that have been campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU are to join forces after the referendum to demand strike-busting European control of French airspace. Ryanair and easyJet, alongside British Airways\u2019 owner IAG, Lufthansa and others, will press for air traffic controllers from neighbouring countries such as Germany to manage French skies during strikes, which have led to the cancellation of thousands of flights this year and could trigger further disruption this summer. The chief executives Carolyn McCall of easyJet, Willie Walsh of IAG and Michael O\u2019Leary of Ryanair will share a platform in Brussels this month to push the EU to speed ahead with plans to merge airspace, under the banner of Airlines for Europe, an alliance of major carriers that account for more than half of all air passenger journeys in Europe. Strike action by French air traffic controllers led to more than 100 flights across Europe being cancelled on Thursday. A strike planned for this weekend in France has been called off by four of the five unions involved, and the French transport ministry said it was confident no action would go ahead. A further strike scheduled for 14 June may still take place. Ryanair, which cancelled 75 flights this week before what it said would be the 50th strike by French controllers since 2009, has launched a petition calling on the EU to act. The Irish airline said more than 200,000 people had so far signed, calling for measures that also include a ban on strikes by the French controllers. Similar action in Greece and Italy has normally affected only domestic flights and caused less disruption to airlines and tourist businesses elsewhere. UK passengers have been among the hardest hit by French strikes, with flights that could operate forced to detour wide into the Atlantic or into central Europe to reach destinations south of France, often queuing in busy airspace. A spokesman for Airlines for Europe said: \u201cIt is the right of anyone to go on strike but it cannot be allowed to affect everyone in Europe.\u201d The group has warned that Europe is \u201churtling towards a summer of disruption and frustration for customers\u201d, and said that strikes in Greece, Italy and Belgium as well as France in the past three months had caused member airlines to cancel more than 2,500 flights, as well as long delays for many that went ahead. The spokesman said airlines were in talks with the European commission and member states to rapidly advance the planned Single European Sky initiative, which would coordinate air traffic control across the continent. But the airlines hope that smaller steps could be taken before full integration, raising the prospect of German controllers at the main base in Langen, near Frankfurt, looking after France\u2019s skies during strikes. Speaking at the global airlines summit in Dublin on Thursday, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) vice-president for Europe, Rafael Schvartzman, described the strikes as one of the \u201cbiggest challenges we see in Europe\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that we have these constant disputes affecting the industry and all of us as passengers. Air traffic controllers are actually highly compensated professionals in a dynamic industry. They should be embracing reforms that are critical to delivering the safety, capacity, cost and environmental improvements that European air travellers deserve.\u201d The ongoing air traffic disputes in France have partly been fuelled by moves to implement the Single European Sky, a programme airlines say would make flights more efficient and have significant economic benefits, but which has been seen as a threat to livelihoods and autonomy in France \u2013 a threat likely to be underlined by the major carriers\u2019 latest move. Schvartzman added Iata\u2019s support: \u201cIt\u2019s time for governments to ensure measures are in place to keep airspace open, including looking to their neighbours within the European Union to help run air navigation services when one country\u2019s controllers have stopped services.\u201d Schvartsman said the technology would already permit neighbouring controllers to navigate flights over French airspace, but politics \u2013 and traditional national sovereignty \u2013 was the stumbling block. \u201cTechnically you can do it. It is not for us to negotiate. It is for the governments to agree. It is something that can be done today by governments.\u201d Walsh, the IAG chief executive, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an initiative that\u2019s been too long in the discussion. We believe that there are technological solutions that exist that could be put in place and we\u2019re calling on the commission to examine them. It\u2019s in the interests of Europe and consumers in Europe to ensure they can continue to travel during disruption to specific air traffic control providers.\u201d The planned declaration and joint event in Brussels will come the week after Britain\u2019s referendum on 23 June. Two of the key players, easyJet and Ryanair, have been campaigning for Britain to remain in Europe, including hosting events with the prime minister and chancellor warning that travel costs would rise and airline investment would be at risk in the event of Brexit. However, the director general of Iata said a decision to leave the EU would probably have no impact on its aviation industry.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco got more than it bargained for when it offered limited edition vinyl pressings of classic albums by the Jam and the Clash as Father\u2019s Day gifts, prompting ageing mods and punks to descend on its stores. Jam enthusiasts have reported driving to multiple Tesco stores to pick up a copy of Sound Affects, the band\u2019s 1980 LP, on pink vinyl. In a clash of cultures and generations, some were met by bewildered Tesco employees, with one asking if vinyl was like a CD and another mistaking calendars for albums. The album, which contains the singles Start! and That\u2019s Entertainment, costs \u00a316 and is available in 150 large stores, according to Tesco. But many fans could not find a copy, sparking searches and tipoffs on social media with Tesco\u2019s music buyer Michael Mulligan involved. Some Jam fans launched an altruistic effort to get copies to bereft fans. Other copies found their way on to ebay with price tags of up to \u00a360. Tesco has stocked up on 1,800 copies each of eight records for Father\u2019s Day with four available on coloured vinyl. As well as Sound Affects, Tesco has the Clash\u2019s double LP London Calling in green and pink, Searching for the Young Soul Rebels by Dexy\u2019s Midnight Runners in green and 12 Gold Bars by Status Quo, predictably in gold. Susan Care, 48, from Camborne in Cornwall, made a 130-mile round trip to a Tesco in Plymouth on Wednesday night and returned with two copies of Sound Affects and a Dexy\u2019s LP at 2am. A fan since the Jam\u2019s heyday of the late 70s and early 80s, she said it was like a trip back in time to when she bought the band\u2019s singles on release day. \u201cI\u2019m probably still about 15 at heart. I\u2019m not particularly obsessive or materialistic but I had to have it. The woman who served us couldn\u2019t find them but then she realised what she thought were calendars in the Father\u2019s Day section might be albums.\u201d Care added: \u201cI can think of better places to buy stuff. I don\u2019t particularly like Tesco because they are everywhere but this was a good idea.\u201d Keith Lewington, who moderates the 13,000-member Jam Society Facebook page, bought 12 copies and mailed them to members for the cover price plus postage. He also posted the barcode for Sound Affects for presentation to Tesco staff. Others also bought multiple copies to sell for no profit when implored by fellow members. Lewington, 48, from Kings Lynn, said: \u201cJam fans are fanatical and there are a lot of collectors. Any new release gets snapped up and there is a certain amount of uncertainty about it and people think: \u2018I want it now, as soon as possible.\u2019 I think that caught Tesco off guard. They can\u2019t have realised how popular the band still are. I was asked by a member of staff if a record was like a CD.\u201d Clash fans were also frustrated because hardly any copies of London Calling, which includes the song Lost in the Supermarket, were available. Tesco said there would be plentiful stocks of the album arriving on Friday and Saturday and that more copies of Sound Affects and other LPs should arrive too. Tesco started stocking records for the first time in its history in December in a bid to cash in on the craze for vinyl and the revival of record players. A Tesco spokeswoman said the retailer ordered the coloured albums, dating from 1979 and 1980, as potential Father\u2019s Day gifts for Tesco\u2019s average CD buyer who would have been about 16 when the LPs were released. She said Tesco had not expected collectors to rush out to buy the records. With more than two weeks till Father\u2019s Day, there may not be many left as gifts for dads. The pink pressing of Sound Affects, which reached number two in the charts in 1980, is thought to be the first UK release of an album by the group, led by mod frontman Paul Weller, on coloured vinyl, sparking particular interest. As well as the coloured pressings, Tesco is stocking four LPs on black vinyl for Father\u2019s Day: Changes One by David Bowie, Purple Rain by Prince and the Revolution, Parklife by Blur, and the Ultimate Collection by Paul Simon.",

      "bodyText": "Police have searched the headquarters of Santander Bank in Madrid after suspicions were raised that the bank was linked to money laundering and tax evasion on the part of some of its clients. Acting on orders of high court judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata, agents of the central operative unit of the Guardia Civil began searching the bank\u2019s offices in Boadilla del Monte in central Spain on Friday morning for information about specific accounts. Santander issued a statement saying it had \u201creceived a request for information about the movements of certain accounts between different entities\u201d. It added that it was collaborating with the authorities and \u201csupplying all the available information\u201d. The case involves the continuing investigation into the Falciani list of accounts from HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank in Geneva, leaked by IT worker Herv\u00e9 Falciani in 2008. The list included the names of some 130,000 suspected tax evaders, 659 of whom were Spanish. The Spanish tax office believes that as much as \u20ac6bn was concealed in these 659 accounts. A large number of the 659 people named regularised their affairs with the taxman but several decided to fight in the courts on the grounds that Falciani had obtained the information illegally and it was therefore not admissible as evidence. De la Mata has been investigating whether HSBC helped clients to conceal and launder money from illicit gains. Sources close to the case say that 40 \u201cindividuals or family groups\u201d are under investigation. All 40 are said to have appeared on Falciani\u2019s list. A tax inspectors\u2019 report says that \u201cthere are indications that HSBC, either through its offices in Switzerland or its branches in Spain or third countries, offered Spanish residents the possibility of placing substantial sums of money in opaque accounts\u201d. Emilio Bot\u00edn, then chief executive of Santander, was the most prominent Spanish name on Falciani\u2019s list, along with several members of his family. The Bot\u00edn family has run the bank since 1909. Bot\u00edn made a \u20ac200m settlement with the Spanish tax agency, which represented 10% of the sum involved, but tax evasion charges were dropped after he made the settlement. His daughter Ana Patricia became CEO when he died in 2014 \u2013 she previously ran Santander in the UK.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct: MPs to discuss sanctions on Mike Ashley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A group of MPs investigating working conditions at Sports Direct are to discuss applying sanctions on Mike Ashley after the retailer\u2019s billionaire founder said he would defy a parliamentary summons to appearbefore the select committee. The move, which could include the tycoon being found in contempt of parliament or facing a Commons vote on whether he is a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person to be running a business, comes after Ashley wrote to MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills committee on Thursday saying he would not be attending next week\u2019s sessions. Having previously said he would be able to attend on the condition that the committee visited the group\u2019s warehouse the day before, Ashley reversed his position when MPs declined the invitation, saying his lawyer, Richard Gordon QC, was unavailable. In March, the tycoon was formally summonsed to appear before MPs to explain his company\u2019s treatment of its workers, after refusing to agree to a number of dates suggested by MPs. The standoff followed a Guardian investigation into the treatment of workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Derbyshire headquarters that found they were subject to surveillance and lengthy searches which meant effectively they earned less than the minimum wage. Sports Direct responded to the reports by announcing a pay rise for its staff, as well as a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, which was to be overseen personally by Ashley. Iain Wright, chairman of the BIS committee, said: \u201cWe are very disappointed by this 11th-hour notification, having given him a notice period of three months to make the necessary arrangements. As democratically elected MPs, we are responding to serious allegations of exploitative employment practices and mistreatment of workers at Sports Direct. Mr Ashley announced in December he would personally oversee a review of working practices at the Shirebrook warehouse. It is entirely reasonable for the select committee to ask Mr Ashley to respond to those allegations and comment on how his review \u2013 announced over six months ago \u2013 is progressing\u201d. Business leaders regularly give evidence to select committees, including former BHS owner Sir Philip Green who has agreed to attend later this month as part of an inquiry into the collapse of the department store chain. Wright said: \u201cDoes Mr Ashley, owning and operating a business in a parliamentary democracy, see himself as being beyond such public scrutiny?\u201d One source close to the parliamentary process said that the committee would now consider filing a special report to the Commons speaker John Bercow, who could advise on the options available. The source said the options might include: a summons for Ashley\u2019s attendance to be issued from the whole of the house; the convening of a privileges committee that could find the billionaire in contempt of parliament; or the filing of a Commons motion where MPs could vote on whether Ashley is a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person to be running a business in a parliamentary democracy. In his latest letter to MPs, Ashley questioned the independence of the committee, citing \u00a37,219.98 of support given last year to Wright\u2019s local constituency party by the union Unite, which has been leading a campaign highlighting the working conditions at Sports Direct. Ashley said: \u201cI note that you have declared that you have a link to Unite on the register of members\u2019 financial interests. Surely it is inappropriate for committee members to have taken donations from a body that is then giving evidence before that same committee to further its own purposes?\u201d On Tuesday, the committee will question Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, and its regional officer, Luke Primarolo. It will also hear evidence from the employment agencies that provide workers to Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse: Andy Sweeney, chief executive of The Best Connection; Chris Birkby, managing director of Transline Group; and Jennifer Hardy, finance director of Transline Group.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy added just 38,000 jobs in May \u2013 122,000 fewer than expected and the weakest growth since 2010. The unemployment rate slipped down to 4.7%, the Department of Labor announced on Friday. The report added to concerns that the US economy is slowing, ahead of a crucial meeting of the Federal Reserve, and was immediately seized on by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \u201cTerrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. A strike by 40,000 Verizon workers impacted the numbers, the labor department said, and without the strike the number of jobs added would have been 72,000, which is still less than half the expected job growth. The unemployment rate is now the lowest it has been since November 2007, and job gains in 2016 have slowed sharply from the 240,000 average of the last two years. On Friday, the Department of Labor also cut its assessment of the number of jobs added in March and April by 59,000. \u201cThe weakness in May\u2019s payrolls was widespread. Manufacturing lost 10,000 jobs, construction shed 15,000 jobs and temporary help fell by 21,000,\u201d wrote Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics chief US economist, in a note to investors. \u201cA June rate hike from the Fed is now very unlikely.\u201d May\u2019s report is the last before the Fed\u2019s next meeting on 14-15 June, when the US central bank may raise interest rates again. The gain was the smallest since September 2010 and is sure to add to speculation that a rate hike could be delayed until July, already uncertainty about Britain\u2019s referendum to exit the EU. That vote will take place on 23 June. After the economy added 160,000 jobs in April \u2013 40,000 fewer than expected \u2013 economists expected the job growth in May to come in at 160,000. Over the past 12 months employment growth had averaged 232,000 jobs a month, but economists expected the 44-day strike of 40,000 Verizon workers to affect the May figures. The last time Verizon workers went on strike, for two weeks in August 2011, the department of labor reported that the economy added no jobs that month. The following month, however, it reported a growth of 103,000 jobs and noted that the spike partially \u201creflected the return to payrolls of about 45,000\u201d striking workers. The recent strike ended last week after the labor department helped Verizon and the union representing the striking workers reach a tentative deal. As job growth slows, Barack Obama has moved to defend his economic legacy. Earlier this week, while speaking in Elkhart, Indiana, he described the US economy as the \u201cstrongest, most durable economy in the world\u201d and pointed out that over the past six years, US businesses have created more than 14m new jobs. \u201cDespite the drop in unemployment, wages are still growing too slowly, and that makes it harder to pay for college or save for retirement,\u201d said Obama, before pointing out that so far this year, wages have grown at a rate of about 3%. Until recently, his administration had described wages as the unfinished business of this recovery. Economists believe that a wage growth of 3% to 3.5% is necessary to help reach the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% inflation goal. Last week, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said that she expects the US labor market to continue to improve and that in the coming months it might be \u201cappropriate\u201d for the Fed to increase interest rates. In December, the Fed increased interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it plays an important role in our policy making beyond us just monitoring the US data and general global financial conditions and having confidence that things are still on a good track,\u201d Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, told CNBC on Friday. Evans, who is a non-voting member of the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee, said that he expects two rate hikes this year. \u201cAs the labor market tightens we should see wage growth rise, however it\u2019s clear that we are not at a level consistent with full employment. With wage growth this low, there is simply no threat of wage-led inflation,\u201d said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cThe Fed should bear this in mind when it meets later this month and not be too quick to raise rates and slow the economy.\u201d A week ago, Yellen said that the US jobs market is nearing full employment.",

    "webTitle": "JP Morgan boss: up to 4,000 jobs could be cut after Brexit", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of JP Morgan has warned that the biggest US bank could cut as many as 4,000 UK jobs if Britain votes to leave the EU. Speaking to employees in Bournemouth, Jamie Dimon said Brexit would be a terrible deal for the UK economy and jobs, and warned that Britain could find itself in a trade war with the EU. With the chancellor, George Osborne, at his side Dimon said JP Morgan would have to act quickly after a vote to leave because it would not be able to service its clients around Europe from the UK as it does now. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it means 1,000 jobs, 2,000 jobs \u2013 it could be as many as 4,000. They will be jobs all round the UK \u2026 I don\u2019t want you to worry about it but when you vote you should be thinking about something like that,\u201d Dimon told employees. JP Morgan employs about 19,000 people in the UK, with its main offices in Canary Wharf, Bournemouth and Glasgow. Dimon has hinted before that JP Morgan could quit or severely reduce its activities in the UK if there was a vote to leave the EU but he has not put a figure on potential job losses before. The bank\u2019s Bournemouth operation employs 4,000 people and provides technological and operations support for the bank in more than 40 countries. Dimon said Brexit would harm the UK and EU economies and cause years of uncertainty and could lead to a breakup of the EU. \u201cIn a bad scenario, and this is not the worst-case scenario, trade retaliation against Britain by countries in the European Union is possible, even though this would not be in their own self-interest. Retaliation would make things even worse for the British and European economies. And it is hard to determine if the long-run impact would strengthen the European Union or cause it to break apart.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Businesses in Britain\u2019s services sector enjoyed a rebound in growth last month but were more nervous about hiring new staff before this month\u2019s EU referendum, according to a survey. One-in-three firms said uncertainty around the 23 June vote was affecting their them, with new business gowing at the slowest pace for three-and-a half years. But 51% of firms in the sector, which spans hotels to insurers, said they had been unaffected by Brexit uncertainty. The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI report showed companies continued to hire in May but at the slowest pace for almost three years, reflecting the slowing of new work coming in. Some firms also said the new \u201cnational living wage\u201d was influencing hiring. The report\u2019s headline measure of activity rose to 53.5 in May from a 38-month low of 52.3 in April. That was well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction and also above a consensus forecast of 52.5 in a Reuters poll of economists. Markit, which compiles the PMI reports, said growth in the services sector, the biggest part of the UK economy, was still weak. Taken with surveys from the smaller manufacturing and construction sectors published earlier this week, this pointed to a sharp slowdown in overall economic growth, said Markit\u2019s chief economist Chris Williamson. \u201cThe PMI surveys show that the pace of economic growth remained subdued in May, as Brexitworries exacerbated existing headwinds,\u201d said Williamson. The data so far suggested that economic growth has slowed to 0.2% in the second quarter from 0.4% in the first quarter, he said. \u201cGrowth has collapsed in manufacturing and construction, leaving the economy dependent on the service sector to sustain the upturn, though even here the pace of expansion has remained frustratingly weak so far this year.\u201d Against the backdrop of tight opinion polls, some business surveys have suggested companies are deferring spending and hiring decisions until after the referendum on EU membership. The Bank of England has warned growth could slow in the April-to-June quarter as a result. Some experts have suggested some of the slowdown in economic activity stems from factors beyond referendum jitters. The global outlook is still uncertain and Britain\u2019s productivity growth remains sluggish. Markit added an extra question to May\u2019s polls of services, manufacturing and construction companies on whether the referendum uncertainty was disrupting their business. Among the respondents to the services survey, 28% reported the referendum was having a detrimental impact, and a further 9% reported a strongly detrimental effect. The combined 37% share who reported some form of negative impact was the highest among the three UK PMI surveys, and slightly higher than the 35% shares registered for both manufacturers and construction companies. With the referendum clouding the outlook and inflation low, the Bank of England has held interest rates at a record low of 0.5%, where they have been for more than seven years. What happens next on interest rates depends on the referendum outcome, said James Smith, economist at ING bank. \u201cShould the UK vote to remain in the EU, we expect a rebound in activity, although this could take a few months to be reflected in the data given the time lag involved in reinstating delayed investment. If this is the case and the UK dataflow picks up by the fourth quarter, we think that the Bank of England could look to hike rates in early 2017,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the UK votes to leave the EU, then the potential for a near-term dip in activity means that the BoE may choose to cut rates to support business confidence.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BP has agreed to pay $175m (\u00a3120m) to settle claims that it deceived shareholders by underplaying the severity of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The settlement, to be paid this year or next, ends a legal battle that began when a Houston judge ruled investors who bought shares shortly after the explosion at its Deepwater Horizon rig could sue BP. Their claim was based on the allegation that BP publicly \u201clowballed\u201d the amount of oil flowing from its Macondo well into the Gulf of Mexico. Company officials stated that between 1,000 and 5,000 barrels of oil were leaking into the Gulf per day, when internal estimates suggested the true figure was 10 times higher. Shares later plummeted when the true scale of the disaster was revealed. Claimants who signed up to the class action suit were seeking as much as $2.5bn. BP shares rose more than 2% in morning trading after the much smaller settlement was revealed. The settlement was limited by an earlier ruling from US district judge Keith Ellison, which narrowed the number of statements made by BP that could be said to have affected the company\u2019s share price. This earlier ruling is thought to have hastened the settlement because it would have benefited BP had the case gone to trial as planned in July. In 2012, BP paid $525m to settle claims from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US financial regulator, that it misled the markets over the size of the spill. In a written statement, BP said: \u201cIn May 2014, the federal district court certified a class of post-explosion ADS purchasers in the MDL 2185 securities litigation. \u201cBP and representatives of the post-explosion class have agreed to settle these class claims for the amount of $175m, payable during 2016-2017, subject to approval by the court. \u201cThis settlement does not resolve other securities-related litigation in connection with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.\u201d About 4.9m barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded, killing 11 people. It is the worst spill in US history. BP has so far set aside $56.4bn to cover the cost of settlements, fines and clean-up costs. The total cost includes a $4bn settlement of criminal charges, an estimated $12.9bn for businesses and individuals who claim the spill cost them money and an $18.7bn environmental settlement with the US government and five states. BP also estimates that the cost of responding to the spill and the oil clean-up reached $14bn.",

Numis added: We believe Icap is ideally positioned to capitalise on the ongoing trends towards electronic trading and central clearing that are being driven by regulatory changes. This is unlikely to go unnoticed by other financial infrastructure companies in our view and we would not be surprised if it became an acquisition target once the sale of the hybrid voice broking division completes. Meanwhile Paul McGinnis at Shore Capital said: The deal looks to be a useful endorsement of the EBS BrokeTec technology platform as Icap transforms itself into a fintech company and should help in driving up the low single digit growth rates most recently reported in the continuing divisions at the March 2016 final results last month.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The head of the Institute of Directors has accused Sir Philip Green of a \u201clamentable failure of behaviour\u201d that risked \u201cdeeply damaging\u201d the British business world as a whole, following the collapse of the high street chain BHS. The administrators, Duff &amp; Phelps, decided to wind down the business with the loss of 11,000 jobs and the closure of all 163 stores after a last-minute rescue deal fell apart. Stores may be sold off individually, but staff do not know whether their jobs will go or not. Green and Dominic Chappell, the former owners, left the company, which was founded in 1928, with a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Topshop boss Green owned BHS for 15 years and sold it to former bankrupt Chappell and his Retail Acquisitions consortium for \u00a31 last year. The IOD chief, Simon Walker, told BBC Radio 4: \u201cSir Philip Green is a very high-profile business leader. He is the person who is on the frontpage with Kate Moss on his arm and who has a \u00a3100m superyacht and so on. When someone like this ends up behaving like this, people think that\u2019s how business is, and it\u2019s not. The majority of business leaders are people who are more likely to have mortgaged their homes to keep their company going than to own this kind of lavish thing.\u201d Asked about the calls for Green to help shore up the pension fund, Walker said: \u201cHe certainly has moral responsibilities and we need a proper investigation. \u201cYou can\u2019t just get yourself off the hook by selling the business to someone who has been bankrupt three times and is a former racing driver with no retail experience. BHS was probably going to fail anyway. But it is the manner of its failure and the fact that it ends up dumping huge liabilities on to the taxpayer that is a problem.\u201d Lord Myners, the former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, also called on Green to take some responsibility for the collapse of BHS, by forgoing his position at the front of the creditors\u2019 queue. The former City minister told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty indisputable that Sir Philip must take some of the responsibility for what happened here, not least of all selling the business to Mr Dominic Chappell, which was rather like giving the keys of your car to a five-year-old and allowing the five-year-old to go off and crash the car. \u201cIt\u2019s a great shame that Sir Philip didn\u2019t seek to rectify that by retaking control of the company from Mr Chappell.\u201d He said that Green, who has lent money to BHS, could give up his position at the front of the creditors\u2019 queue so that the money goes to employees and pensioners instead. There are several inquiries into BHS\u2019s demise, one of the biggest collapses in UK retail history: the House of Commons\u2019 business committee; the Commons\u2019 work and pensions committee; the pensions regulator; and the insolvency service. MPs are scheduled to quiz both Green and Chappell over their roles in coming weeks. \u201cOn the face of it a huge amount of money has been taken out of BHS over recent years, not invested into the business, not paid into the pension fund and the company has run into the wall. We must get to the bottom of why that happened because we have tens of thousands of innocent victims \u2013 employees, suppliers and pensioners.\u201d Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership of BHS, while Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions was paid millions in salaries and management fees. Myners insisted: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can wash your hands of the company after you sold it \u2026 I think you do have a responsibility as a steward to make sure the company is in safe hands.\u201d The taxpayer will pick up the bill for redundancy payments and other pension funds will have to pick up the tab for the huge pension deficit, he said. \u201cInnocent small suppliers\u201d to BHS could see their business collapse, he added. Lord Grabiner, the chairman of Green\u2019s Arcadia group, will also be questioned by MPs. He has said he was not present at the meeting that discussed the sale of BHS. Myners described this as \u201cextraordinary\u201d, adding: \u201cMy suspicion is that we\u2019ll find that BHS had a very informal governance structure built around the court of Philip Green.\u201d",

Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: London\u2019s blue chip index is following leads set by both the US and Asia with some decent gains coming through at the open, although it\u2019s difficult to see them as being all that convincing \u2013 at least for now. The big economic release today is the US non-farm payrolls and this could prove somewhat instrumental in determining just how we finish the week. There\u2019s a nagging doubt that the Federal Reserve will be in a position to hike interest rates this month and any notable shortfall in today\u2019s employment stats would have the potential to kick this idea very much into the long grass. The vast majority of equities in London are finding some degree of positive territory this morning \u2013 rising oil prices and this doubt over US rate hikes is helping commodity stocks towards the top of the board. But Marks &amp; Spencer has fallen 1.3p to 355.3p as analysts at JP Morgan moved from neutral to underweight and slashed their price target from 550p to 307p. The bank cited concerns about growing competition, and cut 2017 pretax profit estimates by 14%. Among the mid-caps PZ Cussons has lost 14p to 326.5p as Canaccord Genuity cut its recommendation on the trading and personal care company from buy to hold. It said: Cussons\u2019 shares have risen 37% since the interim results announcement on 26 January. Helped by a 57% increase in the oil price over the same period (given the company\u2019s Nigerian exposure), the shares have outperformed the FTSE 250 index by 31% in the process. We think risk from the scheduled full year trading update on 9 June is no better than equally weighted (with April\u2019s update stating that performance \u201coverall...has been in line with expectations\u201d), and would take profits in the light of the rerating and the lack of a near term catalyst.",

      "bodyText": "Using your mobile phone in Europe used to be ruinously expensive but from next year it should cost no more than making a call in the UK. European officials have agreed to scrap mobile roaming charges, meaning holidaymakers should no longer arrive home to find they have unwittingly racked up eye-watering bills. More than 9 million Britons are affected by \u201cbill shock\u201d every year, according to price comparison service uSwitch. From mid-2017 all increased costs for calls, texts and data will be abolished. It follows two years of negotiations, as EU member states put up roadblocks for fear that their domestic mobile phone operators would be adversely affected. As of the end of April, roaming costs were reduced to five cents (3.95p) a minute for calls, two cents an SMS and five cents a megabyte of data. \u201cThis shows what we can achieve when Britain plays a leading role in Europe,\u201d said Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder. However, roaming charges will not be completely removed until June 2017 and will require reform of the roaming wholesale market on which national phone operators across Europe trade services between one another. Any delay to these reforms could put back the date at which European roaming charges are scrapped for good. The European commission also looks out for potential competition issues and this month blocked the proposed sale of O2 to Hutchison, the owner of Three. The commission opposed the \u00a310.3bn deal on the grounds that it would mean less choice and higher prices for British consumers. It has also taken steps to standardise mobile phone chargers, although it has found it difficult to get Apple to cooperate. Going a bit further back in history, cooperation between European states on standardised mobile technology has been credited with putting the region at the forefront of the mobile phone industry in its early days. \u201cRapid adoption of the GSM standard in the 1990s made Europe the world leader in mobile communications for two decades,\u201d according to Vodafone. All of this means that as of 2014, Europe was the region with the highest mobile penetration in the world, 78% compared with 72% in the US and 50% worldwide.",
