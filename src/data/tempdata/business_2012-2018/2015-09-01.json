      "bodyText": "A long day of down selling without much respite across the globe has ended with the US\u2019s Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index closing down lower in a single day than it has since the country\u2019s national debt was downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. The Nikkei lost a full 3.8% today and the FTSE lost 3.03%, with other European markets faring poorly as well. The bad news that appears to have kicked off the crunch comes primarily from the Chinese manufacturing sector, which was lower last month than it has been in three years. Those specific economic woes aren\u2019t solely Chinese: the French manufacturing sector contracted at a faster rate in August than it had the month prior, and growth in US manufacturing has slowed, as well. Last week\u2019s highs and lows in the American market were marked by frantic trading throughout the day; today the Dow collapsed at open and stayed low throughout the day. This liveblog is closing down for the day but we\u2019ll be continuing to cover the markets around the clock and will return to live coverage as stock exchanges open tomorrow. The Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 all closed far below their opening prices today after a day of panicked selling of a kind not seen since Black Monday 2011. Dow Jones Industrial Average - 16,058.35, down 469.58 points, -2.84% S&amp;P 500 - 1913.87, down 58.31 points, -2.96% Nasdaq - 4,636.10, down 140.40 points, -2.94% Sobering: 497 of the 500 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are down overall today (at the moment). August 8 is a bad day in US market history - it\u2019s the day Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s (the S&amp;P of S&amp;P 500) downgraded US sovereign debt from AAA or \u201crisk free\u201d to AA+, better known as Black Monday 2011. There are two other Black Mondays: October 19, 1987, when a stock market contagion spread from Hong Kong (people still argue about why - everyone blamed computers at the time), and October 28, 1929, in many ways the starter pistol for the Great Depression. For perspective, the Dow lost 12.82% on Black Monday in 1929 (and then another 11.73% the next day), 22.61% on Black Monday in 1987, and 5.55% on Black Monday in 2011. It\u2019s down by 2.80% at the moment, so this is more of a Grayish Monday at worst. Here\u2019s a quick chart of all the stocks on the Dow just before the top of the hour, ranked by largest chunk of share price lost thus far today. Data captured at 2:58pm. Edited to add: the number on the far right is volume, or total shares traded, bought or sold. A quality cartoon from the great Matt Wuerker last week has aged disappointingly well. Netflix, a stock that has gone from strength to strength over the last several years, has had a rough day. It took a hit like the rest of the market throughout August but today it seems to have been singled out for shareholder ire (well, not singled. Energy stocks aren\u2019t doing great!) and is down by more than 9%. There are three parts to the stock\u2019s troubles today: 1. It\u2019s a lousy day to be publicly traded. 2. Variety reports that Apple may get into original streaming content, the market that Netflix has dominated for years despite legions of imitators who\u2019ve tried (mostly in vain) to woo the company\u2019s loyal customers. Betting against Netflix has been bad business, but betting against Apple is also rarely a winning proposition. 3. The company chose to forego the renewal of a lucrative deal with Epix. It\u2019s a contract that was likely invisible to most consumers but it also put a lot of recent-run movies on the service. Now that Netflix is deeper and deeper in business with Disney (which also sells the streaming service its Marvel Comics live-action shows), Netflix is hoping its upcoming streaming of Disney films will make up the shortfall. The trouble is that there\u2019s a gap between the end of the Epix contract and the start of the Disney, and Epix is signing up with competitor Hulu. This chart is an hour old but it\u2019s still within five points of the Dow as I type this. A little more color on the decline in the manufacturing sector: The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) monthly report reveals that manufacturing is losing momentum and businesses in that sector are skittish. \u201cBusiness is guarded but steady. Margins are tight. Markets are very competitive. China is lackluster,\u201d said an unattributed statement from one of the index\u2019s constituent companies in the wood products industry. The ISM\u2019s main metric, Purchasing Manager Index (PMI), is an important bellwether for the sector (although perhaps not for the economy overall, according to Rob Carnell in the linked block): PMI above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is expanding overall; below 50 percent indicates that it\u2019s declining. In August the index was at 51.1, down from 52.7 the previous month. This is Sam Thielman in New York taking over from Nick. Thus far, things have not gone well in the US markets today. The Dow is down more than 400 points and the S&amp;P 500 is off by more than 50, both hovering around a 2.5% percent decline. The market still has three hours open but if trends continue it will be a rough start after the worst month global markets have seen in years. August\u2019s 6.86% decline exceeded the 9.34% falloff in May 2012, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Energy shares fell for the first time in five days, giving back much of the sector\u2019s recent rally, and commentators are again discussing whether the declines will trip the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d \u2013 automated trading curbs designed to prevent losses from accruing too quickly. Despite the poor Chinese manufacturing data and the negative market reaction, things may not be as bad as they seem, reckons Capital Economics. Its global economist Michael Pearce said: Markets inevitably focused on the weak surveys in China, where the official and Markit manufacturing PMIs fell to a four and six-year low respectively. However, we do not think that the immediate economic outlook there is quite as bad as many headlines suggest. Industrial activity has been depressed by a range of temporary factors which should fade in the coming months, while recent policy easing is still feeding through to the broader economy. For the most part, any weakness appears to have been limited to China. Manufacturing PMIs in the rest of Emerging Asia remained weak, but the global manufacturing PMI excluding China has held up much better in recent months. Admittedly, the latest manufacturing surveys for the US point to continued weakness in the sector. But this is primarily due to the stronger dollar and is not a major concern given that growth in the much larger services sector is motoring ahead. Elsewhere, a breakdown of the euro-zone PMIs revealed declines in both Italy and Spain. The drop in the Spanish manufacturing PMI was the third in a row and suggests that the breakneck pace of expansion in the first half of the year is unlikely to be sustained. Spain\u2019s growth rate is likely to slow further over the coming years as the boosts from a weaker euro and lower oil prices fade. It started in China, again, and sent global markets tumbling once more. Disappointing Chinese manufacturing data set the tone for the day, with commodity companies hit particularly hard and oil prices on the slide. A slowdown in eurozone and UK factory growth did not help matters, nor did weaker than expected US data. So with renewed concerns about the Chinese economy, along with concerns that QE was not helping the eurozone much, and uncertainty over the timing of a US rate rise, investors had every reason to cash in. With a number of key economic indicators this week, not least the US non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, there is likely to be little let up for stock markets. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 189.4 points or 3.03% to 6058.54, with mining companies the leading losers and only one riser in the form of engineering group Meggitt Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.38% to 10,015.57 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.4% lower at 4541.16 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 2.24% at 21,451.37 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.59% off at 9992.8 The Athens market fell 0.43% to 621.51 Meanwhile on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 348 points or 2.1% lower. Oil is one of the fallers of the day, with Brent crude now down more than 7.5%: Here\u2019s our latest report on the day\u2019s market falls, from Katie Allen: Global stock markets staged a dramatic start to September as rising worries about China\u2019s economic slowdown sparked fresh sell-offs in Asia, Europe and on Wall Street. After suffering their worst month in three years in August, US shares tumbled after Tuesday\u2019s opening bell. In early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 2.2% and the S&amp;P 500 had sold off 1.9%. News that US manufacturing activity slowed in August added to pressure on share prices. The sell-off on Wall Street mirrored losses in Asia overnight, and later on European bourses, in the wake of more weak data on China\u2019s manufacturing sector, suggesting output slumped to a three-year low in August. Worries about waning demand from the world\u2019s second biggest economy left Japan\u2019s Nikkei down a hefty 3.8%, taking it close to a six-month low last week. China\u2019s Shanghai composite index suffered a smaller 1.3% loss. As the sell-off rippled out to Europe, the FTSE 100 index of bluechip London-listed shares was down more than 3% at 6,056 on Tuesday afternoon, extending last month\u2019s sharp losses. A 6.7% drop during August marked the worst month for UK\u2019s leading share index since May 2012. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 shed 9% over the same period, the worst monthly performance for four years. On Tuesday it was down 3%. Investor confidence has been rattled by a combination of factors. Alongside signs China\u2019s economy is slowing, the country\u2019s stock market has tumbled from multi-year highs in June and interventions by policymakers have done little to stem the rout. At the same time, markets are bracing for the prospect of the first US interest rate rise since before the global financial crisis. Full story here: Reports of further Chinese action to help stabilise its stock market, from the South China Morning Post: And the slide in global markets continues: Over to Greece, and there are reports that the country\u2019s creditors may delay the first bailout review by a month or so to November. Citing EU sources, agency MNI said the creditors are worried that the forthcoming election may derail the economy, and they have yet to agree on milestones for the next tranche of funding for the country. This move could push talks of potential debt relief further into the distance. Ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, ING Bank\u2019s Rob Carnell has been reading the runes of today\u2019s ISM data for clues to the jobs figure: With Federal Reserve vice-chair, Stanley Fischer, hinting over the weekend at his Jackson Hole speech that a September rate hike remained possible (and downplaying what is likely to be a soft CPI release later this week), the market is turning its attention to data relevant to Friday\u2019s all-important labour report. The run-up to this report kicked off today with the August manufacturing ISM. The headline index fell from 52.7 in July, to 51.1 in August, but the focus currently has to be on the employment index of this survey. This fell 1.5 points to 51.2. Unfortunately, of all the data we have to scrutinise this week, this is perhaps the least useful of all. Changes of the manufacturing ISM employment index have a correlation of only 0.3 with changes in the non-manufacturing ISM employment index since January 2013, which should arguably be a more reliable index for payrolls given its broader coverage of the labour market. But even that correlation is the wrong sign, and we should probably ignore it completely. In comparison with the manufacturing ISM, its big-sister index, the non-manufacturing ISM has virtually no correlation at all with the directional change in the first release of payrolls changes. Over the same period, its correlation is 0.02 (though we take solace in it having at least the right sign). In short, today has told us nothing, and may even be misleading. Moreover, the non-manufacturing index release on Thursday will be only about as useful as tossing a coin. All of which leaves the ADP index on Wednesday as the least worst of a very bad bunch of payrolls indicators (correlation Jan 2013 to present equals +0.55). Consensus is looking for 200,000, up from 185,000 in July. Anything either side of that could see big market swings. The weak manufacturing data has pushed Wall Street even lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 380 points or 2.3%. The slowdown in US manfacturing growth has been confirmed by the Institute of Supply Management. Its index of factory activity fell to 51.1 in August from 52.7 the previous month, the lowest reading since May 2013. It was below analysts\u2019 expectations of a 52.6 reading. With the global economy - especially China - showing signs of slowing down, it is no surprise that US export orders are under pressure. With both the ISM and the Markit reports showing a weaker than expected economy, a decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise rates in September is again thrown into question. The US manufacturing sector grew at its slowest pace in almost two years in August, according to the first of the day\u2019s two sector surveys. The final US manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index from Markit fell to 53 from 53.8 in August. This was the lowest level since October 2013, but was slightly higher that the preliminary reading of 52.9. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: August\u2019s survey highlights that the US manufacturing sector continues to struggle under the weight of the strong dollar and heightened global economic uncertainty, but resilient domestic spending and subdued cost pressures are keeping the recovery on track. Reflecting this, new orders from abroad have now fallen in four of the past five months, which represents the weakest phase of manufacturing export performance since late-2012. More details on the opening falls in US markets from my colleague Dominic Rushe: The Dow was off around 2% the S&amp;P 500 1.37% and the Nasdaq 1.9% as investors reacted to more bad news about China\u2019s economy. The falls followed a small dip on Monday. When the markets closed, they had experienced their worst August in three years. As expected, Wall Street has opened sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 300 points or nearly 2% within minutes of the opening, in the wake of poor Chinese data and ahead of two surveys of US manufacturing. The stock exchange has invoked Rule 48 - which suspends a requirement for stock prices be announced at the market open and is designed to help market makers in times of major volatility. This is the fourth time in two weeks the exchange has used this regulation. Time for a recap, while we brace for the opening of Wall Street (and manufacturing PMIs from America). 1) The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned emerging markets to expect volatility as Beijing attempts to rebalance its economy. On a trip to Indonesia, Christine Lagarde sounded the alarm, saying: Other emerging economies, including Indonesia, need to be vigilant to handle potential spillovers from China\u2019s slowdown and tightening of global financial conditions. Lagarde also warned that global growth is weaker than the IMF had expected, further dampening optimism over the world economy. Here\u2019s the full story: 2) World stock markets have also been hit by fresh worries over China\u2019s economy, after a new survey showed that its factories are shrinking at the fastest pace in five years. There is also concern over Europe\u2019s recovery, after factory growth in Spain and Italy slowed, and France suffered another contraction. Europe\u2019s stock markets are all deep in the red today, with mining stocks leading the rout. Here\u2019s the damage: FTSE 100: down 188 points or 3% at 6071 German DAX: down 292 points or 2.8% at 9966 French CAC: down 125 points or 2.7% at 4527 Investors remain gripped by worries over China\u2019s economy, a week after Black Monday and three weeks after the surprise devaluation of the yuan. As Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets puts it: Another set of disappointing Chinese manufacturing data prompted a lower open for UK and European stocks on Tuesday with a slowdown in Europe\u2019s own manufacturing sector exacerbating the declines. Asian markets had already suffered a bad day. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell almost 4%, and the Shanghai Composite lost 1% despite a late recovery that suggested the authorities had intervened again. These photos show the picture at stock markets worldwide. 3) Canada\u2019s economy has fallen into recession, underlining weaknesses in the global economy. 4) But there are (much-needed) signs of recovery in the eurozone labour market. The jobless rate dipped to 10.9% in July, despite rising unemployment in France, Finland and Austria. Wall Street is not a happy place today, as fears over China\u2019s economy sweep through New York again. The Dow is now expected to shed 400 points, or 2.4%, when trading kicks off in 45 minutes. The Canadian economy has been dragged into recession by the fall in the oil price, and the weaker global economy. Canada\u2019s GDP fell by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year, new data from Statistics Canada show. That\u2019s not as bad as economists expected. But, following a 0.2% contraction in January-March, it means Canada is officially suffering a \u2018technical recession\u2019. Some photos from the world\u2019s stock markets, on another worrying day for investors: Today\u2019s falling markets show that investors simply cannot shake off their fears over China, says Philip Marey, strategist at Dutch financial group Rabobank: \u201cThe problem is that we have these brief spells of optimism like we had last week when U.S. GDP was revised up, but the overall theme is still the weakness in China and that is very hard to dispel from markets.\u201d (via Reuters) Analysts at Barclays are concerned that China\u2019s manufacturing PMI fell to a three-year low last month. Here\u2019s their take: \u201cThe summer weakness [in China] could be linked to the recent Tianjin port explosion and large-scale factory closures in Beijing ahead of the WWII victory day parade on 3 September,\u201d. \u201cEven so, we believe the multiyear-low PMI confirms that the economy is still not on a solid footing, and we look for a flat growth profile during the rest of 2015, with continued downside risks,\u201d they added. One UK company is bucking today\u2019s selloff, though - Aga Rangemaster, whose shares have jumped 10%. The takeover battle for Aga intensified this morning when white goods maker Whirlpool made an approach to the cooker maker, potentially beating an earlier bid from Middleby. My colleague Sean Farrell explains: Whirlpool\u2019s intervention pits two US companies against each other to take Aga into foreign ownership more than 80 years after its kitchen ranges were first manufactured in Britain... The Aga cooker, made mainly from scrap metal, absorbs heat from a constantly burning source, which is then used for cooking. The cookers became an established feature of cultural life in 1990 when the Oxford Companion to English Literature first included the term \u201cAga saga\u201d \u2013 intended to sum up the novels of Joanna Trollope and once memorably characterised as tales of illicit rumpy-pumpy in the countryside. Cripes! More here: Every share on the FTSE 100 index has lost ground today, as the City kicks off September with a broad-based selloff. That has left the FTSE 100 languishing down 2.1%, or -133 points, at 6114. Dawn just broke over New York, but there\u2019s not much sunshine in the markets. The US stock market is expected to fall by over 2%, when Wall Street opens at 9.30am local time (2.30pm BST). August was the worst month for the US stock market in three years, and there\u2019s no sign (yet) that September will show a strong recovery. Overnight, Australia\u2019s central bank left interest rates unchanged at their current record low of 2%. The RBA flagged up the \u201cfurther softening in conditions in China and east Asia\u201d recently, but also pointed stronger US growth. Economists believe Australia\u2019s economy will slow, as China\u2019s troubles ripple through the global economy. Here\u2019s the full story: Finally, some good news. The eurozone\u2019s jobless rate has fallen to its lowest level since 2012. Unemployment across the single currency region dipped to 10.9% in July, down from 11.1% in June. The recovery was broad-based, with unemployment falling in 23 EU member states and stable in two (Belgium and Romania). Only Finland, France and Austria suffered rising joblessness over the last 12 months. As usual, the lowest unemployment rate was recorded in Germany (4.7%), followed by the Czech Republic and Malta (both 5.1%). The highest (of course) was Greece (25.0% in May 2015) and Spain (22.2%). Youth unemployment remains far too high, with 21.9% of under-25s out of work across the eurozone. And while the drop in unemployment is clearly welcome, Europe\u2019s unemployment rate is roughly double that of America (5.3% in July). Tens of thousands of protesters are marking Christine Lagarde\u2019s visit to Jakarta with a demonstration. They are calling for higher wages and an end to job cuts, and urging Indonesia\u2019s leaders to launch new stimulus measures to kick-start its economy. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has warned emerging nations to brace themselves for the impact of China\u2019s economic slowdown. Speaking in Indonesia today, Lagarde said the global economy was weaker than the IMF had expected. And the recent spike in \u201cglobal risk aversion and financial market volatility\u201d could hurt growth in Asia. China is a particular cause of concern. Lagarde said: As the Chinese economy is adjusting to a new growth model, growth is slowing\u2014but not sharply, and not unexpectedly. The transition to a more market-based economy and the unwinding of risks built up in recent years is complex and could well be somewhat bumpy. That said, the authorities have the policy tools and financial buffers to manage this transition. Other emerging economies, including Indonesia, need to be vigilant to handle potential spillovers from China\u2019s slowdown and tightening of global financial conditions. The IMF chief also warned that the US Federal Reserve is close to raising America\u2019s interest rates, potentially dragging capital out of developing economies: There are signs that the recovery is firming up in the United States, advancing the prospects of interest rate lift off. This could pose a risk for emerging economies, including Indonesia, in the form of weaker capital flows, higher interest rates, and financial volatility. Lagarde also challenged Indonesian leaders to end the exclusion of young people and women from its economy. Here\u2019s the full speech Connor Campbell of SpreadEX confirms that the problems in China\u2019s factories have pushed European shares down this morning: After that awful August things haven\u2019t gotten off to the greatest start this September, with further disappointing data from China immediately creating drag for the European indices. Weak manufacturing and services PMIs from both the official figures and the Caixin surveys shows the Chinese slowdown is showing no signs of, well, slowing down. Growth in Britain\u2019s factory sector also slowed last month, Markit says. The UK factory PMI dipped to 51.5, from 51.9, dashing City hopes of a small increase in growth. Firms also reported that employment levels fell in August, for the first time in two years. Europe\u2019s stock markets are now down by around 2.5%, following the double-whammy of weak manufacturing data from China (see here), and mixed reports from Europe (here) The FTSE 100 has now shed 143 points to 6103, as September gets off to a downbeat start. Glencore, the commodities trading firm, has fallen by 6%. Jameel Ahmad, chief market analyst at FXTM, says investors are alarmed by the latest signs of economic weakness in China, where factory output shrank last month. While it is true that expectations were for a contraction anyway, the data just provided further confirmation that economic momentum is slowing down in China with the economy looking further exposed and increasingly vulnerable to dropping below Beijing\u2019s 7% GDP before the end of the current quarter. The chances of GDP growth falling below the government\u2019s target are actually intensifying each time an economic announcement is released from China, mainly because all data is consistently pointing towards the economic momentum declining in this major economy. European stock markets are falling deeper into the red, after data firm Markit reported that Europe\u2019s manufacturing growth slowed in August. Markit\u2019s eurozone PMI dipped to 52.3, from 52.4 in July. Decent growth in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain was balanced by fresh contractions in France and Greece: Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at Markit, says Europe\u2019s factory sector showed \u201cresilience\u201d last month. However.... Given the ongoing situation in Greece it was not surprising to see that nation\u2019s manufacturing sector register a further sharp downturn, although a sharp slowing in the rate of contraction raises hopes that the lowest point has been passed. The French industrial sector also remains in the doldrums and is likely to continue to act as a drag on the broader French economy. And this charts shows just how Greece\u2019s economy suffered from the introduction of capital controls this summer, as its bailout crisis escalated: German factories have bucked the trend, posting their fastest growth in 16 months. Germanys manufacturing PMI jumped to 53.3 in August, from 51.8 a month earlier. Firms reported that they received more new orders, from home and abroad, leaving many with larger backlogs of work. This is worrrying. France\u2019s factory sector shrank at a faster rate last month, adding to the gloom. The French manufacturing PMI fell to 48.3, from 49.6 in July, indicating a sharper contraction (50 = the cut-off point between expansion and contraction). Here\u2019s Markit\u2019s bullet points: Output and new orders fall at sharper rates Further slight drop in employment Prices charged decline at fastest pace in three months Growth in Italy\u2019s factory sector has slowed to a seven-month low, suggesting its economy remains lacklustre. The Italian manufacturing PMI dipped to 53.8 in August, from 55.3, with firms reporting slower growth in new orders, output and employment. The selloff in Europe is deepening, wiping 100+ points off the FTSE 100 index: Here comes the first European data of the morning.....and it shows that growth in Spain\u2019s factory sector is still growing, but at its slowest rate since last October. The Spanish manufacturing PMI fell to a ten-month low of 53.2 in August, down from 53.6 in July. Markit, which compiles the data, says that manufacturing \u201ccontinued to improve in August\u201d. However... While output rose sharply, there were signs of a slowdown in growth of new orders during the month. China\u2019s stock market also suffered fresh losses today, following the confirmation that its factory sector shrank last month. The Shanghai Composite index just closed, down 1.2% at 3,165 points. It had been lower earlier today, suggesting that Beijing authorities may have staged one of their regular interventions.... Germany\u2019s DAX index is dropping back towards last week\u2019s lows: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says today\u2019s selloff shows that risk appetite has been \u201csapped\u201d by the latest disappointing China PMI data. Manufacturing has contracted to a three-year low low as Beijing\u2019s stimulus effort fail to deliver, maintaining investor anxiety about the impact of economic slowdown on global growth. The Services sector may remain buoyant (expanding, but more slowly) but this is offering little relief. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has fallen by 70 points at the start of trading, as September begins where August left off. That\u2019s a tumble of around 1.2%. Mining shares are the biggest fallers, with Anglo American and BHP Billiton shedding around 3%. That reflects concerns over China\u2019s weakening economy. The other European markets are also losing ground, with Germany\u2019s DAX down 1.8% and France\u2019s CAC dropping 1.5%. The oil price has fallen around 2.5% this morning, sending Brent crude down to $52.82 per barrel. That follows three extraordinary day\u2019s trading in which oil surged by 25%, having hit its lowest levels since 2009 a week ago. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index has fallen by almost 4% today, as the latest disappointing Chinese data hurts stock markets across Asia. Here\u2019s the current situation: The news that China\u2019s services firms reported slower growth is a worry, says Angus Nicholson of IG: China\u2019s rebalancing of the economy requires robust and steady reallocation of labour to the services sector and away from the over-capacity industrial sector, and it is this element of the PMIs that is most worrying. Japanese manufacturers are also suffering from the recent strengthening of the yen. Good morning. After the drama of August, September is getting underway with fresh falls across Asia\u2019s stock markets. And Europe likely to follow suit when trading begins shortly. Investor confidence has been hit by fresh data from China overnight, showing that its factory output slumped to a three-year low in August. China\u2019s official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), dropped to 49.7 in August from 50 in July. Any reading below 50 indicates that the sector has begun shrinking, and the survey has added to growing fears over China\u2019s resilience. As Zhao Qinghe, an economist with the National Bureau of Statistics, put it: \u201cThere is insufficient growth momentum in the country\u2019s manufacturing sector.\u201d A separate survey of China\u2019s smaller factories, from Caixin, released today fell to a six-year low of 47.3 from 47.8 in July: Dr He Fan, Chief Economist at Caixin Insight Group, warned that: \u201cThe final Caixin China Manufacturing PMI for August continued to retreat, with sub-indices signalling continued weak demand in the markets for goods and factors of production. Recent volatilities in global financial markets could weigh down on the real economy, and a pessimistic outlook may become self-fulfilling.\u201d And if that\u2019s not enough, Caixin also reported that China\u2019s service sector growth had slowed last month. Spread-betting firm IG predict that the main European markets will suffer fresh losses today: Coming up: Many more manufacturing surveys are published today. That includes the eurozone at 9am BST, the UK at 9.30am, and the US at 3pm. The latest eurozone unemployment data, for July, is released at 10am BST. Investors should keep an eye on Greece too; Syriza\u2019s leader Alexis Tsipras will begin his election campaign in Crete, in an attempt to woo voters ahead of the election on September 20.",

Betting against Netflix has been bad business, but betting against Apple is also rarely a winning proposition. </p> <p><strong>3. The company chose to forego the renewal of a lucrative deal with Epix.</strong> It\u2019s a contract that was likely invisible to most consumers but it also put a lot of recent-run movies on the service. Now that Netflix is deeper and deeper in business with Disney (which also sells the streaming service its Marvel Comics live-action shows), Netflix is hoping its upcoming streaming of Disney films will make up the shortfall. The trouble is that there\u2019s a gap between the end of the Epix contract and the start of the Disney, and Epix is signing up with competitor Hulu.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-01T18:29:19.656Z\">at 7.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55e5ea23e4b07fc7c43d2531\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-01T18:11:21.991Z\">7.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The Dow is off by more than 400 points</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/markets/statuses/638760885327110152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Dow is now off more than 400 points <a href=\"http://t.co/Js3NGwHm3W\">http://t.co/Js3NGwHm3W</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/swTuKZZzy0\">pic.twitter.com/swTuKZZzy0</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg Markets  (@markets) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markets/status/638760885327110152\">September 1, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This chart is an hour old but it\u2019s still within five points of the Dow as I type this.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-01T18:12:02.604Z\">at 7.12pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55e5e5e1e4b07fc7c43d2524\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-01T18:03:35.381Z\">7.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A little more color on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/sep/01/stock-markets-fall-weak-chinese-factory-data-business-live#block-55e5b021e4b05d63bca6dcb4\">the decline in the manufacturing sector</a>: The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) monthly report reveals that manufacturing is losing momentum and businesses in that sector are skittish. </p> <p><strong>\u201cBusiness is guarded but steady.

However, we do not think that the immediate economic outlook there is quite as bad as many headlines suggest. Industrial activity has been depressed by a range of temporary factors which should fade in the coming months, while recent policy easing is still feeding through to the broader economy.</p> <p>For the most part, any weakness appears to have been limited to China. Manufacturing PMIs in the rest of Emerging Asia remained weak, but the global manufacturing PMI excluding China has held up much better in recent months.</p> <p>Admittedly, the latest manufacturing surveys for the US point to continued weakness in the sector. But this is primarily due to the stronger dollar and is not a major concern given that growth in the much larger services sector is motoring ahead.</p> <p>Elsewhere, a breakdown of the euro-zone PMIs revealed declines in both Italy and Spain. The drop in the Spanish manufacturing PMI was the third in a row and suggests that the breakneck pace of expansion in the first half of the year is unlikely to be sustained. Spain\u2019s growth rate is likely to slow further over the coming years as the boosts from a weaker euro and lower oil prices fade.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55e5cdbbe4b080890bc8d09d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-01T16:18:11.441Z\">5.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets close sharply lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It started in China, again, and sent global markets tumbling once more. Disappointing Chinese manufacturing data set the tone for the day, with commodity companies hit particularly hard and oil prices on the slide. A slowdown in eurozone and UK factory growth did not help matters, nor did weaker than expected US data. So with renewed concerns about the Chinese economy, along with concerns that QE was not helping the eurozone much, and uncertainty over the timing of a US rate rise, investors had every reason to cash in. With a number of key economic indicators this week, not least the US non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, there is likely to be little let up for stock markets.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 shed 9% over the same period, the worst monthly performance for four years. On Tuesday it was down 3%.</p> <p>Investor confidence has been rattled by a combination of factors. Alongside signs China\u2019s economy is slowing, the country\u2019s stock market has tumbled from multi-year highs in June and interventions by policymakers have done little to stem the rout.</p> <p>At the same time, markets are bracing for the prospect of the first US interest rate rise since before the global financial crisis. </p> </blockquote> <p>Full story here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/01/global-stock-markets-begin-september-with-more-losses\">Global stock markets begin September with more losses</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-01T15:38:05.053Z\">at 4.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55e5c160e4b0977cea74b825\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-01T15:17:45.524Z\">4.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reports of further Chinese action to help stabilise its stock market, from the South China Morning Post:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/george_chen/statuses/638724678287101953\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: 50 China brokerages will jointly contribute 100 bln RMB capital to gov margin finance agency to start &quot;new round of market rescue&quot;</p>&mdash; George Chen (@george_chen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/george_chen/status/638724678287101953\">September 1, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/george_chen/statuses/638726015028584448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New round of capital contributions by 50 firms came after CSRC meeting Saturday as regulator urge sec industry to be united to stabilize mkt</p>&mdash; George Chen (@george_chen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/george_chen/status/638726015028584448\">September 1, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55e5beeee4b02104a6a2b6cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-01T15:06:49.160Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And the slide in global markets continues:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d17e7c7c4954e31a62319b840946016d82a3c3bf\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441119981172/e87d945a-2855-4a4e-a4fd-9b03c285391c-460x419.png\" alt=\"Global markets on the slide\" width=\"460\" height=\"419\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global markets on the slide</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55e5b89ce4b05d63bca6dce2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-01T14:43:53.304Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Over to Greece, and there are reports that the country\u2019s creditors may delay the first bailout review by a month or so to November.</strong></p> <p>Citing EU sources, agency MNI said the creditors are worried that the forthcoming election may derail the economy, and they have yet to agree on milestones for the next tranche of funding for the country.

The headline index fell from 52.7 in July, to 51.1 in August, but the focus currently has to be on the employment index of this survey. This fell 1.5 points to 51.2.</p> <p>Unfortunately, of all the data we have to scrutinise this week, this is perhaps the least useful of all. Changes of the manufacturing ISM employment index have a correlation of only 0.3 with changes in the non-manufacturing ISM employment index since January 2013, which should arguably be a more reliable index for payrolls given its broader coverage of the labour market. But even that correlation is the wrong sign, and we should probably ignore it completely.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f043884fd91160a8b514a2745c9dedee7b81337b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f043884fd91160a8b514a2745c9dedee7b81337b/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Fed\u2019s Stanley Fischer at Jackson Hole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Fed\u2019s Stanley Fischer at Jackson Hole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Crosby/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In comparison with the manufacturing ISM, its big-sister index, the non-manufacturing ISM has virtually no correlation at all with the directional change in the first release of payrolls changes. Over the same period, its correlation is 0.02 (though we take solace in it having at least the right sign). In short, today has told us nothing, and may even be misleading. Moreover, the non-manufacturing index release on Thursday will be only about as useful as tossing a coin.</p> <p>All of which leaves the ADP index on Wednesday as the least worst of a very bad bunch of payrolls indicators (correlation Jan 2013 to present equals +0.55). Consensus is looking for 200,000, up from 185,000 in July.

In the US all the major indices closed down, the second fall of the week, following similar falls in Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.8% at 469 points, the S&amp;P 500 closed down 2.95% and the Nasdaq down 2.95%. US stocks are on course for their worst performance since the end of 2011. The sell-off came after more signs of weakness in China\u2019s economy. Data on China\u2019s manufacturing sector suggested output slumped to a three-year low in August. US markets closed down on Monday too, ending their worst August in three years. Speaking in Indonesia, Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said the global economy was weaker than the IMF had expected. And the recent spike in \u201cglobal risk aversion and financial market volatility\u201d could hurt growth in Asia. She said China could cope with the gear change but added other emerging economies would have to be vigilant in order \u201cto handle potential spillovers from China\u2019s slowdown and tightening of global financial conditions\u201d. \u201cAs the Chinese economy is adjusting to a new growth model, growth is slowing \u2013but not sharply, and not unexpectedly. The transition to a more market-based economy and the unwinding of risks built up in recent years is complex and could well be somewhat bumpy. That said, the authorities have the policy tools and financial buffers to manage this transition,\u201d said Lagarde. The news from China led to a broad sell off around the world. In London the FTSE 100, closed on Monday for a public holiday, fell 189.4 points, or 3.03%, to 6,058.54.

      "bodyText": "Aga Rangemaster, the maker of cast-iron cookers favoured by the English middle class, has become the subject of a bidding war between two US companies after Whirlpool made a takeover approach. The UK company said Whirlpool, the world\u2019s biggest appliance maker, had contacted it about making a cash bid. Aga said it would open its books to let the company decide whether to make a formal bid. Whirpool is understood to have made its approach in the past few days. Whirlpool\u2019s approach could derail Aga\u2019s agreement in July to sell itself to Middleby, a US food services business, for \u00a3129m in cash. Aga said without a firm bid from Whirlpool it would proceed with its sale to Middleby, which is due to be approved by shareholders on 8 September. If shareholders back the Middleby offer, the Aga board will decide whether to enter a binding \u201csanction\u201d agreement on the planned date of 16 September. It could delay the date of the binding agreement if Whirlpool made an offer. Aga said: \u201cThe board of Aga retains the ability to adjourn the sanction hearing if it receives an offer from Whirlpool prior to this deadline which it would intend to recommend to Aga shareholders or if it otherwise considers an adjournment necessary.\u201d Whirlpool\u2019s intervention pits two US companies against each other to take Aga into foreign ownership more than 80 years after its kitchen ranges were first manufactured in Britain. Middleby\u2019s offer of 185p a share was 77% more than Aga\u2019s closing share price the day before it revealed it was in talks with Middleby. Its shares jumped 8% to 198p in early trading on Tuesday as investors bet that a higher bid was in the offing. The Aga cooker, made mainly from scrap metal, absorbs heat from a constantly burning source, which is then used for cooking. The cookers became an established part of cultural life in 1990 when the Oxford Companion to English Literature first included the term \u201cAga saga\u201d \u2013 intended to sum up the novels of Joanna Trollope and once characterised as tales of illicit rumpy-pumpy in the countryside. Trollope thought the term \u201cpatronising\u201d of readers. The set of the BBC\u2019s rural radio soap opera, The Archers, also has a real Aga to get the authentic sound of the iron door closing. Aga employs about 2,500 people with more than 2,000 of them working at its factories and offices, mainly in the UK. It also has plants at Leamington Spa, Long Eaton in Derbyshire and Ketley in Shropshire. Though best known for the cookers that sell for up to \u00a315,000, it also owns the upmarket Fired Earth tiles and home decoration business. Whirlpool\u2019s brands in the US include Maytag, Kitchen Aid and Jenn-Air. In the UK, Whirlpool sells washing machines, dishwashers and other appliances under its own brand. Aga said when it announced the takeover by Middleby that the deal would increase sales of Aga and Rangemaster cookers in the US and give Middleby a base to expand into consumer products outside the US.",

      "bodyText": "Poundland, which has built a near-\u00a3900m business from selling goods with a single price tag of \u00a31, has started an online shopping service in a bid to deepen its appeal to bargain-conscious shoppers - with a delivery charge of \u00a34. Launched on Tuesday, the website sells more than 2,000 items across Poundland\u2019s traditional range of food and drink, homeware, toys and stationery. As well as branded goods, such as Kellogg\u2019s cereals, Heinz sauces and Fray Bentos pies, shoppers will be able to buy Poundland\u2019s own-range products, including kitchen utensils sold under the name of the celebrity cake-maker Jane Asher and DIY goods promoted by the TV builder Tommy Walsh. The delivery charge will be waived for customers spending more than \u00a350. There is no minimum order. It will also take up to five working days for a delivery to arrive, and at present there is no option to upgrade to a faster delivery service. Nor is Poundland allowing customers to collect orders from its stores - the \u201cclick and collect\u201d option increasingly popular with shoppers - as companies clamp down on personal deliveries at work. The service is currently only available in the UK. Poundland\u2019s chief executive, Jim McCarthy, said: \u201cThe online shopping market is a rapidly growing channel and one which could provide a significant potential opportunity for us. This trial is an important first step towards giving more customers access to our amazing value.\u201d Poundland is the latest discount retailer to move into online shopping, after its rival Poundworld launched a website selling around 4,000 products in April. George Scott, a senior consultant at the retail analyst Conlumino, said Poundland\u2019s online shopping service could be a game-changing move. \u201cIt is is still very early days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could steal a march on the supermarkets in the food market ... The discount space [online] is not very competitive at the moment.\u201d The launch comes after competition authorities gave the green light last month to Poundland\u2019s \u00a355m takeover of its rival 99p Stores. The Competition and Markets Authority ruled that competition would not be damaged if Poundland combined with 99p Stores to create an 800-shop discount retailer. Poundland rang up sales of more than \u00a31bn this year and aims to open 1,000 stores in the UK. The company also has 40 stores in Ireland and nine in Spain under the Dealz brand. Poundland opened its first store in in 1990, in Burton upon Trent. When its preliminary results were announced earlier this year, the company had 588 stores in the UK and Ireland. Consumers\u2019 love of a bargain has driven a boom in fixed-price retailers, but some are now questioning whether the era of rapid growth is over. Market researchers at the Local Data Company have identified six towns in the UK where pound stores have reached saturation, and Poundland revealed a decline in sales when it published its latest financial results. The retailer has been developing its shopping website for more than three years and had hoped to launch before last Christmas, until McCarthy pulled the plug. In an interview with the Guardian earlier this year, he said an earlier version was not \u201csufficiently attractive and easy for people\u201d. \u201cWhen we do launch, I want them tweeting about it and sharing it with their friends.\u201d According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 76% of adults across Britain have bought goods or services online in 2015, up from 53% in 2008. Clothing and sports goods are the most popular online purchases. Poundland shares were changing hands at 345p on Tuesday, a fraction down on the day, but they remain almost 9% higher than a year ago.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chair of Man Group\u2019s business in China is said to have been called to a meeting between foreign financial firms and market authorities as Beijing puts pressure on prominent figures in the financial industry over recent heavy falls in share prices. After Bloomberg News reported that Li Yifei, who runs the UK hedge fund group\u2019s Chinese operation, had been taken into custody to help with a police investigation into market volatility, Li\u2019s husband, Wang Chaoyong, told the Financial Times (paywall) the Bloomberg article was not accurate. \u201cLi is in a meeting with [financial industry] authorities at the moment in the suburbs of Beijing,\u201d Wang told the FT. He said the meeting was continuing from Monday and \u201cit sounds like there are a lot of people attending from foreign financial institutions\u201d. Wang said he did not know what the meeting was about and that because it was confidential those attending had to keep their mobile phones turned off. The Bloomberg report, which cited a person familiar with the matter, added that Li\u2019s assistance did not imply she had done anything wrong or would face charges. A spokesman for Man Group in London declined to comment. The company\u2019s shares fell almost 5% to 153p in late-morning trading, making it the third-worst performer in the FTSE 250 index, although less than 1% of Man\u2019s \u00a351bn of assets are in China. Li is one of the most recognisable members of the Chinese financial sector, even though Man does not have a licence to trade shares in China. Her role is to attract business from Chinese investors for the group\u2019s funds that invest around the world. Xinhua, the state news agency, said on Monday a total of 197 people had been caught up in an investigation into the spreading of rumours about the stock market. Wang Xiaolu, a journalist for the Caijing business magazine, read out a confession on television admitting to spreading false information while reporting on the stock market. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have sought to make a big splash just for the sake of sensationalism,\u201d he said. Reuters said it had not been possible to verify whether the journalist made his confession freely. Chinese shares have fallen about 40% since mid-June, rocked by concerns about a slowdown in its once booming economy and a surprise currency devaluation last month. On Tuesday the Shanghai composite lost 1.3%. The authorities in China have repeatedly blamed market manipulators and foreign forces for the turmoil. In July, the ministry of public security said it would help the China securities regulatory commission investigate evidence of \u201cmalicious\u201d short selling of stocks and indexes. Short sellers bet that prices will fall by borrowing securities and selling them in the hope they will be able to buy them back more cheaply. The clampdown on supposed market manipulators has set nerves rattling among investors about how China responds when markets do not act as Beijing would like. Michael Hewson, market analyst at the CMC Markets, the spreadbetting company, said the hardline approach seemed to be for domestic consumption. Outside investors would continue to have fears about the fundamentals of the Chinese economy and markets, he said. \u201cWhile these measures may suit the narrative of the Chinese government in helping mask some of the problems in the Chinese economy they do nothing for investor confidence, and in particular in improving investment confidence within China itself.\u201d Li was previously a managing director at the Chinese arm of the hedge fund GLG Partners, according to a biography posted on the website of the Rockefeller Foundation, where she is a trustee. Man Group bought GLG in 2010. Before working at GLG, Li was managing director of MTV Networks in China, and also worked as chief representative at the Chinese business of the US media company Viacom, which owns MTV. In May 2001, when she was 37 and worked for Viacom, Fortune magazine named Li as one of 25 rising global business leaders for the next generation. She was also a national champion in Chinese martial arts, according to her Rockefeller Foundation biography.",

The company\u2019s shares fell almost 5% to 153p in late-morning trading, making it the third-worst performer in the FTSE 250 index, although less than 1% of Man\u2019s \u00a351bn of assets are in China.</p> <p>Li is one of the most recognisable members of the Chinese financial sector, even though Man does not have a licence to trade shares in China.

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets staged a dramatic start to September as rising worries about China\u2019s economic slowdown sparked fresh sell-offs in Asia, Europe and on Wall Street. After suffering their worst month in three years in August, US shares tumbled after Tuesday\u2019s opening bell. At close, the Dow Jones industrial average had dropped 469 points, or 2.8%, to 16,058 and the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 index fell 58 points, or 3%, to 1,913. News that US manufacturing activity slowed in August added to pressure on share prices. The sell-off on Wall Street mirrored losses in Asia overnight, and later on European bourses, in the wake of more weak data on China\u2019s manufacturing sector, suggesting output slumped to a three-year low in August. Worries about waning demand from the world\u2019s second biggest economy left Japan\u2019s Nikkei down a hefty 3.8%, taking it close to a six-month low last week. China\u2019s Shanghai composite index suffered a smaller 1.3% loss. As the sell-off rippled out to Europe, the FTSE 100 closed down more than 3% at 6,058.54 on Tuesday afternoon, extending last month\u2019s sharp losses. A 6.7% drop during August marked the worst month for UK\u2019s leading share index since May 2012. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 shed 9% over the same period, the worst monthly performance for four years. On Tuesday it was down 3%. Investor confidence has been rattled by a combination of factors. Alongside signs China\u2019s economy is slowing, the country\u2019s stock market has tumbled from multi-year highs in June and interventions by policymakers have done little to stem the rout. At the same time, markets are bracing for the prospect of the first US interest rate rise since before the global financial crisis. Despite the recent market turmoil, there is still some expectation that the US Federal Reserve could hike as soon as this month, especially after its vice-chair Stanley Fischer said over the weekend that it was too soon to decide on a September move. The likelihood of higher borrowing costs in the US is undermining already fragile confidence in emerging markets from Latin America to Asia. Against the backdrop of market turmoil, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned that global growth will be weaker than previously expected. Christine Lagarde also said emerging economies should be alert to potential shockwaves from China\u2019s slowdown. \u201cOverall, we expect global growth to remain moderate and likely weaker than we anticipated last July. This reflects two forces: a weaker than expected recovery in advanced economies, and a further slowdown in emerging economies, especially in Latin America,\u201d Largarde said in a speech at the University of Indonesia in Jakarta. \u201cAsia as a region is still expected to lead global growth. But even here, the pace is turning out slower than expected \u2013 with the risk that it may slow even further given the recent spike in global risk aversion and financial market volatility,\u201d she said. After sharp moves for oil and the prices of metals such as copper in recent trading, Lagarde cautioned they could remain under pressure. Oil prices have been buffeted by the prospect of waning demand from China, the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer. Brent crude slid more than 5% on Tuesday to $51 per barrel. It had fallen below $43 per barrel at one point last week, but prices then climbed by 25%. The current price compares with a peak of $115 last summer. Market attention will now shift to figures on the US labour market on Friday for more clues on when the country\u2019s central bank will feel ready to raise interest rates. September\u2019s decision will be finely balanced after several indicators have pointed to a slowdown in global growth. The latest batch of manufacturing surveys that kicked off the month were no exception. China\u2019s official manufacturing index, based on a survey of factory purchasing managers, fell last month to 49.7, the lowest level since August 2012, from 50.0 in July. A separate private survey, the Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index, fell to a six-year low of 47.3 from 47.8 in July. The number was slightly better than the preliminary reading released last month, which prompted the Black Monday panic. In the US, the manufacturing sector grew at the slowest pace for more than two years in August, according to a report from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM). In the UK, a survey of manufacturers by data company Markit signalled they cut their headcount for the first time in two years in August amid an uncertain outlook for exports. Markit\u2019s manufacturing survey of the eurozone also showed slower growth. It had all added up to an \u201canother ugly morning\u201d for stock markets, said Connor Campbell, analyst at spread-betting company Spreadex. \u201cThe weeks-long negative influence from China, which has dominated the markets like the Greek saga on steroids, was exacerbated by Europe\u2019s own disappointing manufacturing figures,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Two caravan park firms are to merge, creating a \u00a31bn company that will be Britain\u2019s biggest holiday home park operator, with 73 sites across the country. </p> <p>Park Resorts owner, private equity firm Electra, said the merger with rival Parkdean Holidays would create a company with annual profits of more than \u00a3100m, and an enterprise value of \u00a3960m. The deal will bring together Electra\u2019s Park Resorts, which also owns South Lakeland Parks, South View and Manor Parks, with Parkdean, which is owned by rival private equity firm Alchemy Partners.<br></p> <p>Britain has more than 3,000 caravan and campsites, according to industry estimates, and market researchers Mintel said 14% of British holidaymakers took a camping or caravan park holiday in the 12 months to October 2014.</p> <p>As \u201cstaycations\u201d and \u201cglamping\u201d have become more popular in recent years, the industry has grown to be worth almost \u00a33bn in annual revenues, employing nearly 34,000 people, according to industry research firm IBISWorld. </p> <p>The glamping trend has seen higher-income people who would not normally camp stay in luxury yurts or safari tents with beds and wood burning stoves. </p> <p>\u201cAfter declining sharply in 2009-10, the industry recorded solid growth largely due to the staycation phenomenon,\u201d IBISWorld said last month. </p> <p>The latest corporate deal, which a company source said had \u201clong been coming,\u201d is the biggest in the sector since <a href=\"http://www.warnerleisurehotels.co.uk/affiliate-hub/about-us.aspx\">Bourne Leisure\u2019s \u00a3700m acquisition of Rank\u2019s holiday division</a> in 2000, which included Butlins and Haven holiday parks and Warner Leisure Hotels. </p> <p>It comes after a number of smaller deals this year that saw <a href=\"http://www.phoenix-equity.com/News.aspx?MasterId=179\">Bridge Leisure sold to Phoenix Equity Partners</a> for \u00a336m in January, <a href=\"http://www.ldc.co.uk/News/LDC-backs-secondary-buy-out-of-Away-Resorts.aspx\">Away Resorts sold to private equity firm LDC</a> in April and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/02/canadian-investment-firm-buys-uk-center-parcs-business-in-24bn-deal\">Center Parcs acquired by Canadian investment firm Brookfield Property Partners</a> in a \u00a32.4bn deal in June.</p> <p>John Mitchell, director of retail, hotels and leisure at property consultants Bilfinger Real Estate/GVA, said: \u201cThe proposed transaction is certainly exciting for the UK holiday market. It confirms our original views from some four years ago that there would be further consolidation in the sector amongst the top four or five operators and this appears to be a good geographical fit.\u201d</p> <p>Parkdean is based in Newcastle and runs 24 self-catering holiday parks with static caravans, chalets and lodges for hire, mostly in the south-west of England, along with a handful in Scotland, two in south Wales and one in Norfolk. It also sells holiday homes \u2013 caravans and lodges \u2013 from \u00a39,995. Park Resortswhich is offering September weekend breaks from \u00a379, is twice the size, with 49 holiday parks spread mainly across northern England, the Lake District, the Isle of Wight and Scotland.</p> <p>The merger still needs to be cleared by the Competition and Markets Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Electra has also agreed a new \u00a3550m debt facility with banks Barclays, RBS and JP Morgan in a refinancing deal that will return \u00a396m of cash to the private equity firm.<br></p> <p>Electra will own 45% of the new group while Alchemy will own about a third, with the management team also holding a stake. The name of the new company and who will run it has not been decided yet.</p> <p>Former Whitbread boss Alan Parker, who became chairman of Park Resorts in November, said the two businesses were an \u201coutstanding strategic fit with highly complementary estates and revenue mixes\u201d. The geographical overlap between the two businesses is very small. The new company will keep both head offices, in Newcastle and Hemel Hempstead.</p> <p>Alex Fortescue, chief investment partner at Electra Partners, added: \u201cWhat started as an investment in Park Resorts\u2019 senior debt has now become an equity position in a business of real scale and with strong growth prospects in the UK domestic holiday sector.\u201d</p> <p>Electra has invested \u00a3131m in Park Resorts since buying the then struggling business\u2019s senior debt in 2012. The private equity house led a refinancing in August 2013 and acquired South Lakeland Parks, Southview and Manor Park holiday parks and most recently the Summerfields holiday park at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk.</p> <p>Parkdean started life with one caravan park in 1999 and was bought out by private equity firm 3i, which floated the business on the London stock market (AIM) in 2002 with a value of \u00a332m.

      "bodyText": "Two caravan park firms are to merge, creating a \u00a31bn company that will be Britain\u2019s biggest holiday home park operator, with 73 sites across the country. Park Resorts owner, private equity firm Electra, said the merger with rival Parkdean Holidays would create a company with annual profits of more than \u00a3100m, and an enterprise value of \u00a3960m. The deal will bring together Electra\u2019s Park Resorts, which also owns South Lakeland Parks, South View and Manor Parks, with Parkdean, which is owned by rival private equity firm Alchemy Partners. Britain has more than 3,000 caravan and campsites, according to industry estimates, and market researchers Mintel said 14% of British holidaymakers took a camping or caravan park holiday in the 12 months to October 2014. As \u201cstaycations\u201d and \u201cglamping\u201d have become more popular in recent years, the industry has grown to be worth almost \u00a33bn in annual revenues, employing nearly 34,000 people, according to industry research firm IBISWorld. The glamping trend has seen higher-income people who would not normally camp stay in luxury yurts or safari tents with beds and wood burning stoves. \u201cAfter declining sharply in 2009-10, the industry recorded solid growth largely due to the staycation phenomenon,\u201d IBISWorld said last month. The latest corporate deal, which a company source said had \u201clong been coming,\u201d is the biggest in the sector since Bourne Leisure\u2019s \u00a3700m acquisition of Rank\u2019s holiday division in 2000, which included Butlins and Haven holiday parks and Warner Leisure Hotels. It comes after a number of smaller deals this year that saw Bridge Leisure sold to Phoenix Equity Partners for \u00a336m in January, Away Resorts sold to private equity firm LDC in April and Center Parcs acquired by Canadian investment firm Brookfield Property Partners in a \u00a32.4bn deal in June. John Mitchell, director of retail, hotels and leisure at property consultants Bilfinger Real Estate/GVA, said: \u201cThe proposed transaction is certainly exciting for the UK holiday market. It confirms our original views from some four years ago that there would be further consolidation in the sector amongst the top four or five operators and this appears to be a good geographical fit.\u201d Parkdean is based in Newcastle and runs 24 self-catering holiday parks with static caravans, chalets and lodges for hire, mostly in the south-west of England, along with a handful in Scotland, two in south Wales and one in Norfolk. It also sells holiday homes \u2013 caravans and lodges \u2013 from \u00a39,995. Park Resortswhich is offering September weekend breaks from \u00a379, is twice the size, with 49 holiday parks spread mainly across northern England, the Lake District, the Isle of Wight and Scotland. The merger still needs to be cleared by the Competition and Markets Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Electra has also agreed a new \u00a3550m debt facility with banks Barclays, RBS and JP Morgan in a refinancing deal that will return \u00a396m of cash to the private equity firm. Electra will own 45% of the new group while Alchemy will own about a third, with the management team also holding a stake. The name of the new company and who will run it has not been decided yet. Former Whitbread boss Alan Parker, who became chairman of Park Resorts in November, said the two businesses were an \u201coutstanding strategic fit with highly complementary estates and revenue mixes\u201d. The geographical overlap between the two businesses is very small. The new company will keep both head offices, in Newcastle and Hemel Hempstead. Alex Fortescue, chief investment partner at Electra Partners, added: \u201cWhat started as an investment in Park Resorts\u2019 senior debt has now become an equity position in a business of real scale and with strong growth prospects in the UK domestic holiday sector.\u201d Electra has invested \u00a3131m in Park Resorts since buying the then struggling business\u2019s senior debt in 2012. The private equity house led a refinancing in August 2013 and acquired South Lakeland Parks, Southview and Manor Park holiday parks and most recently the Summerfields holiday park at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. Parkdean started life with one caravan park in 1999 and was bought out by private equity firm 3i, which floated the business on the London stock market (AIM) in 2002 with a value of \u00a332m. Parkdean was taken private again by Alchemy in 2006 in a \u00a3135m deal. More holiday parks now have 12-month licences compared with the traditional 10 or 8 months\u2019 seasonal use. Local planning authorities have granted them over the last few years as caravans have become more sophisticated, larger and with improved heating and insulation, according to a winter 2014 report from Bilfinger/GVA. \u201cIt is still incumbent on the park owner to \u2018police\u2019 this holiday use but there may be a temptation for some to allow residential use, thereby creating problems for the future, which is likely to adversely affect the value of a park,\u201d the report said. Smaller parks tend to sell for \u00a31m to \u00a33m. Regarding holiday bookings, the report said: \u201cMemories of the poor summer weather in 2013 are a continued hangover and the tendency has been to book later shorter breaks, closer to home over the last few years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A cruise operator has alleged a government bureaucrat advised it to sack its Australian staff and hire foreign crew on cheaper wages to remain competitive under the Coalition\u2019s proposed new shipping laws. When the North Star Cruises Australia owners\u2019 representative Bill Milby asked transport department officials how that fitted with the Coalition\u2019s budget message of supporting small business, they shrugged their shoulders, he said. A spokesman for the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development has denied such advice was provided to NSCA. But Milby rejected their denial and told Guardian Australia: \u201cThey did, and if push comes to shove I will say it under oath and I will take a lie detector test.\u201d The NSCA operates expedition cruise ships such as True North off the northern coast of Western Australia. Milby was present when the deputy prime minister and transport minister, Warren Truss, announced in May the government would deregulate shipping laws to remove \u201cred tape\u201d. Under Truss\u2019s legislation, workers on non-Australian flagged vessels will only be subject to Australian wages and conditions if the ships trade in Australia for more than 183 days, roughly six months of the yearly permits. It will also streamline requirements to a single shipping licence for boats operating between domestic ports. Milby said in answer to his question, Truss had denied it would make Australian ships uncompetitive. He then took it up with the minister\u2019s officials, telling them his company would struggle to compete because foreign ships would operate with costs of between 50% and 70% lower than Australian-owned and crewed vessels. \u201cThe [department] executive director\u2019s advice to me during that discussion was if NSCA wanted to remain competitive with the foreign-owned and crewed ships it should \u2013 quote \u2018consider taking our ship True North off the Australian Shipping Register, re-register the ship in a suitable foreign country, lay off our Australian crew and hire a cheaper foreign crew\u2019 unquote,\u201d Milby said in a submission to the Senate committee considering the legislation. \u201cWhen she suggested this I told her that I could not believe the suggestion she made and she said quote \u2018to remain competitive in the world that is what we should do\u2019 unquote.\u201d Milby was so shocked he arranged a meeting in Canberra with the department in June to further discuss the legislation, given foreign crew are paid one-third of Australian wages. The company told a departmental officer that foreign shipping firms did not have to pay payroll tax, superannuation, workers compensation, holiday pay or for seafarers insurance or training requirements. \u201cI asked ... how they expected Australian expedition ship owners such as NSCA to compete with the foreign-crewed ships and remain in business and they suggested the following: \u201c1. First take True North off the Australian Shipping Registry. \u201c2. Register True North in a foreign country, and, reflag our ship True North with a foreign flag. \u201c3. Then replace the Australian crew (apart from the captain and chief engineer) with foreign crew who would not be governed under the Australian labour laws and the Australian Fair Work Act. \u201c4. The foreign crew would also be trained in a foreign country \u2013 not Australia, saving more money. Milby\u2019s submission went on: \u201cI asked how they could justify this course of action which will threaten not only NSCA but also all of the Australian ships and ferries that trade on the whole Australian coastline and their answer was, \u2018Australia is part of the international market and we have to compete with international operators.\u2019 \u201cI asked them how they could justify the negative impact this new legislation will have on all of the small businesses and supporting businesses in regional Australia, especially after the 2015-16 budget announced by the prime minister and treasurer, where they both placed a big emphasis on small business being the backbone of the Australian economy and the budget measures were proof of the government\u2019s support. \u201cAll I got from both of them was a shrug of the shoulders.\u201d Truss\u2019s department denied giving such advice. \u201cThe department did not provide this advice,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe Australian government is working to build a more competitive and efficient shipping industry and is committed to reforming coastal shipping.\u201d The other concern of the shipping company was that foreign ships would not have the same respect for the pristine environment of much of the Australian coastline as local operators. The NSCA submission said when the company had raised the environmental concerns with the department, the federal bureaucrat suggested it was a state government problem. \u201cSo it would appear that if the new coastal trading legislation goes through, the federal government will subrogate any environment issues \u2013 of which the potential is enormous \u2013 to the states to sort out,\u201d the submission says. When the company raised the issue with the West Australian deputy premier and tourism minister, Kim Hames, NSCA received a letter from him suggesting the changes would result in broader economic benefits as a result of opening up regional ports to foreign vessels. While Hames acknowledged he was concerned at the potential impact on the WA environment, he suggested a more appropriate response was to exclude \u201csmaller passenger vessels from any relaxation of the current legislation\u201d. Labor, the unions and other Australian shipping companies have expressed their concern at the legislation, which is now before the Senate standing committee on rural, regional affairs and transport. The committee is due to report on the bill in October. The ongtime Liberal party member Peter Cadwallader, of the Intercontinental Shipping Group, which operates bulk carrier ICS Silver Lining, said in his own submission that jobs and tax revenue would be lost to Australia as a result of the legislation. \u201cAs a longtime member of the Liberal party (nearly 50 years), I am aware that the focus of Coalition policy is jobs and growth,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth of these objectives will be sacrificed by this bill in direct contradiction of Coalition policy.\u201d",

He then took it up with the minister\u2019s officials, telling them his company would struggle to compete because foreign ships would operate with costs of between 50% and 70% lower than Australian-owned and crewed vessels. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe [department] executive director\u2019s advice to me during that discussion was if NSCA wanted to remain competitive with the foreign-owned and crewed ships it should \u2013 quote \u2018consider taking our ship True North off the Australian Shipping Register, re-register the ship in a suitable foreign country, lay off our Australian crew and hire a cheaper foreign crew\u2019 unquote,\u201d Milby said in a <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Rural_and_Regional_Affairs_and_Transport/Shipping_Bill_2015/Submissions\">submission to the Senate committee</a> considering the legislation.</p> <p>\u201cWhen she suggested this I told her that I could not believe the suggestion she made and she said quote \u2018to remain competitive in the world that is what we should do\u2019 unquote.\u201d</p> <p>Milby was so shocked he arranged a meeting in Canberra with the department in June to further discuss the legislation, given foreign crew are paid one-third of Australian wages. The company told a departmental officer that foreign shipping firms did not have to pay payroll tax, superannuation, workers compensation, holiday pay or for seafarers insurance or training requirements.</p> <p>\u201cI asked ... how they expected Australian expedition ship owners such as NSCA to compete with the foreign-crewed ships and remain in business and they suggested the following:</p> <p>\u201c1. First take True North off the Australian Shipping Registry.</p> <p>\u201c2. Register True North in a foreign country, and, reflag our ship True North with a foreign flag. </p> <p>\u201c3. Then replace the Australian crew (apart from the captain and chief engineer) with foreign crew who would not be governed under the Australian labour laws and the Australian Fair Work Act.</p> <p>\u201c4. The foreign crew would also be trained in a foreign country \u2013 not Australia, saving more money. </p> <p>Milby\u2019s submission went on: \u201cI asked how they could justify this course of action which will threaten not only NSCA but also all of the Australian ships and ferries that trade on the whole Australian coastline and their answer was, \u2018Australia is part of the international market and we have to compete with international operators.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI asked them how they could justify the negative impact this new legislation will have on all of the small businesses and supporting businesses in regional Australia, especially after the 2015-16 budget announced by the prime minister and treasurer, where they both placed a big emphasis on small business being the backbone of the Australian economy and the budget measures were proof of the government\u2019s support. </p> <p>\u201cAll I got from both of them was a shrug of the shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>Truss\u2019s department denied giving such advice.</p> <p>\u201cThe department did not provide this advice,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe Australian government is working to build a more competitive and efficient shipping industry and is committed to reforming coastal shipping.\u201d</p> <p>The other concern of the shipping company was that foreign ships would not have the same respect for the pristine environment of much of the Australian coastline as local operators. </p> <p>The NSCA submission said when the company had raised the environmental concerns with the department, the federal bureaucrat suggested it was a state government problem.</p> <p>\u201cSo it would appear that if the new coastal trading legislation goes through, the federal government will subrogate any environment issues \u2013 of which the potential is enormous \u2013 to the states to sort out,\u201d the submission says.</p> <p>When the company raised the issue with the West Australian deputy premier and tourism minister, Kim Hames, NSCA received a letter from him suggesting the changes would result in broader economic benefits as a result of opening up regional ports to foreign vessels. </p> <p>While Hames acknowledged he was concerned at the potential impact on the WA environment, he suggested a more appropriate response was to exclude \u201csmaller passenger vessels from any relaxation of the current legislation\u201d. <br></p> <p>Labor, the unions and other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/01/australian-shipping-firm-urges-coalition-to-scrap-planned-changes-to-labour-laws\">Australian shipping companies</a> have expressed their concern at the legislation, which is now before the Senate standing committee on rural, regional affairs and transport. The committee is due to report on the bill in October.</p> <p>The ongtime Liberal party member Peter Cadwallader, of the Intercontinental Shipping Group, which operates bulk carrier ICS Silver Lining, said in his own submission that jobs and tax revenue would be lost to Australia as a result of the legislation.</p> <p>\u201cAs a longtime member of the Liberal party (nearly 50 years), I am aware that the focus of Coalition policy is jobs and growth,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth of these objectives will be sacrificed by this bill in direct contradiction of Coalition policy.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers cut their headcount for the first time in two years in August amid an uncertain outlook for exports, in the latest sign that China\u2019s economic slowdown is being felt around the world. Global markets have been hit by a shares rout in China amid fears the world\u2019s growth engine is running out of steam. Those worries were fanned overnight by news that the output of China\u2019s factory sector slumped to a three-year low in August. Shares in Europe were sharply lower on Tuesday morning, extending losses made over August, the worst month in years for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 was down a heavy 2.3% at 6,104 in mid-morning trading and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 2.5%. That followed sharp losses in Asian markets overnight where Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 3.8%, taking it close to the six-month low hit last week. China\u2019s Shanghai composite index suffered a smaller 1.3% loss. In the UK, a key survey of manufacturers was weaker than City analysts had been expecting and it highlighted businesses\u2019 growing concerns about China. The headline activity index on the Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI fell to to 51.5 in August, from 51.9 in July, confounding forecasts for it to edge up to 52.0. While the index was still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, economists said it suggested manufacturers would make little contribution to overall economic growth in the UK in the coming months. Official data last week showed the manufacturing sector contracted in the second quarter while overall GDP growth was a solid 0.7%. Echoing official figures showing UK unemployment edging up in recent months, the jobs index in the PMI survey dropped below 50 for the first time since April 2013, as larger companies in particular cut jobs. Manufacturers continued to rely on the domestic market as new export business contracted for the fifth successive month. \u201cThe sector looks unlikely to make much of a contribution to the solid gain in broader GDP growth expected for the third quarter,\u201d said Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit. \u201cExport order volumes continue to disappoint, with the sterling exchange rate, weak sales growth to the eurozone and the slowdown in China all having an impact. Given that China makes up only a small proportion of UK exports, the direct impact of a slowing in that nation is likely to be minimal. However, it is too early to say what the indirect impact may be if there is any knock on effect for broader global economic growth.\u201d Economists point out China\u2019s slowdown has mixed effects on the UK. The downward pressure on oil prices is keeping inflation low and should boost household budgets. Meanwhile the market turmoil could prompt the Bank of England to keep interest rates at their record low for longer. But for exporters, waning demand is another blow on top of a stronger pound, that makes UK goods more expensive to overseas buyers. Manufacturers say that while direct UK exports to China are relatively small, there could still be a blow to factories who supply other European exporters. Mark Stephenson, manufacturing expert at the consultancy Deloitte, said the China worries added to pressure on UK companies. \u201cA reduction in demand from China for imported goods would affect both direct UK imports and those of the broader global manufacturing base that UK manufacturers supply. The supply chains of many UK manufacturers depend upon Chinese manufacturers and will be impacted to varying degrees,\u201d he said. A survey by the manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF published over the weekend showed almost half \u2013 47% \u2013 of companies were concerned about a possible sharp slowdown in China. \u201cFor some sectors in manufacturing, the slowdown in China is not a new story. We\u2019ve seen exports of vehicles to China, for example, on the slide since the end of last year,\u201d said the EEF\u2019s chief economist, Lee Hopley. The worries go beyond exports and the manufacturing supply chain, she added. \u201cThe more widespread impact, at least in the near term, is likely to be the knock to already-delicate confidence levels.\u201d The slowdown in the UK PMI index published on Tuesday mirrors the picture in surveys from China and the eurozone. China\u2019s official manufacturing index, based on a survey of factory purchasing managers, fell last month to 49.7, the lowest level since August 2012, from 50.0 in July. A separate survey, the Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index, fell to a six-year low of 47.3 from 47.8 in July. The number was slightly better than the preliminary reading released last month which prompted the Black Monday panic. Markit\u2019s eurozone manufacturing PMI dipped to 52.3 in August, from 52.4, as decent growth in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain was balanced by fresh contractions in France and Greece.",

      "bodyText": "Small business lobbyists fear the Abbott government has pushed controversial competition law reforms \u201cout into the never never\u201d because it could not resolve deep divisions within its cabinet or stare down \u201cthe big end of town\u201d. The changes were the second item on Tuesday\u2019s cabinet agenda and ministers had received a slide presentation from the small business minister, Bruce Billson, about the so-called \u201ceffects test\u201d, which has deeply divided cabinet and pitted the biggest companies in the country against the small business \u201cengine room\u201d that the government courted with its \u201chave a go\u201d 2015 budget. Many senior ministers are opposed to Billson\u2019s determination to change the law to better protect small business \u2013 as recommended by the government\u2019s recent review. The deferral, announced by the prime minister to the surprise of his cabinet and advisers, may mean the big business lobby wins the debate by default. \u201cI really fear this has been pushed into the never never,\u201d said the chief executive of the Council of Small Business of Australia, Peter Strong. \u201cThe big end of town have thrown everything they\u2019ve got at this. But the government had to answer a simple question: do they look after the big end of town or to they look after the economy?\u201d Emerging from cabinet to announce a separate decision, Tony Abbott at first denied that the effects test was on the agenda, and then said it had been delayed. \u201cThere will be a discussion about the recommendations of the review, the [competition policy] review, but not the effects test. That\u2019s something that we are still considering,\u201d he said. Abbott had left most ministers, and big business lobbyists, with the impression that he backed Billson\u2019s plan to implement the competition law changes as advocated by the small business lobby and some business groups. But after an intensive lobbying campaign against the changes by big business and deep opposition from senior cabinet ministers, his comments on Tuesday were much more equivocal, emphasising all the things the government had already done for small business. Billson was trying to convince ministers he could \u201cappease\u201d the powerful Business Council of Australia while still implementing the changes, to which he has given vehement public support. He had accused the BCA of peddling \u201cnonsense\u201d on the issue. Companies including Telstra, Bluescope and Qantas are understood to have joined the two big supermarkets, Coles and Woolworths, as well as Wesfarmers and the BCA in a major lobbying campaign to defeat the move, which was recommended by the Harper review of competition policy. And several of Billson\u2019s cabinet colleagues \u2013 including the treasurer, Joe Hockey, the attorney general, George Brandis, the trade minister, Andrew Robb, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, and the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 are understood to oppose it. Billson told Guardian Australia on Monday that it was \u201centirely unreasonable for big business to want to dictate the rules about how we make sure that big business does not harm consumers and the economy\u201d. \u201cWe should never lose sight of the fact that these laws are in place to put some bumper rails around the might of these businesses.\u201d The change \u2013 one of 56 recommendations from the Harper review \u2013 is also opposed by Labor, who Billson has accused of \u201cdrinking the BCA Kool-Aid\u201d. The difficulty in passing the changes through the Senate plays into cabinet\u2019s deliberations. The proposed changes to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act would require a small business to prove that the action of a bigger business had the \u201ceffect\u201d of substantially lessening competition, instead of being required to prove that the action had been done with that \u201cpurpose\u201d. The change would also remove a section forbidding a big business from \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of its market power. The BCA says this would significantly widen activities that might be caught by the act. The changes are vigorously supported by small business and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, independent retailers and the National Farmers\u2019 Federation. The say the change would encourage, rather than diminish, competition and say the claim that it would force price rises is a \u201cfurphy\u201d. They say Billson\u2019s proposed changes would bring Australia into line with other countries and would create a more level playing field.",

      "bodyText": "The Abbott government\u2019s \u201cjobs and growth\u201d slogan will come under further scrutiny on Wednesday with economists predicting sluggish, and possibly negative, growth when the June quarter figures are released. The Reserve Bank of Australia left its key interest rate at a record low on Tuesday on the eve of what is expected to be a limp set of economic growth figures. As the share market and Aussie dollar were hit by renewed uncertainty about the Chinese growth, the central bank said a cash rate of 2% was appropriate for an economy that is expected to be growing below its long term average of 3 to 3.25% \u201cfor some time yet\u201d. Economists expect Wednesday\u2019s national accounts will show the economy grew at about 0.5% in the June quarter, half the pace recorded in the previous three months. That would translate to annual growth of around 2.2%. But some experts believed that economic activity may even have shrunk in the three months to the end of June. Figures released on Tuesday showed that the country\u2019s trade deficit ballooned to $19bn for the second quarter compared with $13.5bn in the first three months of the year. A fall in exports thanks to poor weather in April which closed coal ports cut a larger than expected 0.6 percentage points from growth although other data showed government spending in the same period was larger than forecast. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP, said the firm had revised its Q2 forecast downwards to 0.1% and would be \u201cno surprise\u201d if Wednesday\u2019s number was negative. The ASX200 share index experienced a torrid day on Tuesday, falling 2.12% to close at 5096, after two surveys showed China\u2019s huge manufacturing sector was contracting. Other key markets across the region, including the Nikkei in Japan and the China\u2019s own Shanghai Composite, also finished in the red. The Australian dollar also struggled and was buying US70.80c at 6.30pm. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Australian chief economist, Adam Boyton, said continued soft demand for resources and slower growth in China were among the factors that could force the Australian dollar below US60c to its lowest value against the greenback since at least early 2003. But the assistant federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, played down speculation that the economy could be set to shrink. He pointed to the ASX 200 companies, of which 170 had reported to date and 61% achieved better results than the previous year. A lower Australian dollar, low interest rates and energy costs were all factors contributing to good growth across the economy, he said. Yet the latest Essential Research online poll found 41% of respondents saying the economy is heading in \u201cthe wrong direction\u201d, compared with 35% who said it was heading the right way, and more than half saying they were concerned about the cost of electricity and gas. But a separate survey, the weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan gauge of consumer confidence, showed sentiment rising by 0.3%, a third consecutive week it has held above its long-term average. ANZ\u2019s chief economist, Warren Hogan, said this was a surprising result given last week\u2019s volatility in the Australian and global stock markets.",

      "bodyText": "Asia Pacific stock markets were rattled again on Tuesday after Chinese manufacturing showed further signs of weakness, adding to evidence of an inexorable slowdown in the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Two closely watched barometers of factory activity released on Tuesday were at multi-year lows, reviving concerns about the state of the country\u2019s economy which caused a major sell-off on the world\u2019s financial markets last week. The Nikkei share index in Japan closed down 3.8%, worsened by figures which showed Japanese firms are not investing in new plant and equipment because of concerns about demand from China. The Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets were also in the red. The Shanghai Composite index was down 1.2%. In Korea, the Kospi index was down 1% after worse than expected export figures and in Australia the ASX200 index closed down 2.12% as economic growth threatens to dip into negative territory for the latest quarter when figures are released on Wednesday. China\u2019s official manufacturing index based on a survey of factory purchasing managers fell last month to 49.7, the lowest level since August 2012, from 50.0 in July. The index, compiled by the Chinese Federation for Logistics and Purchasing, is based on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 indicate expansion. A separate survey, the Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index, fell to a six-year low of 47.3 from 47.8 in July. The number was slightly better than the preliminary reading released last month which prompted the Black Monday panic. Caixin\u2019s survey focuses on smaller, private enterprises while the federation\u2019s survey is weighted toward larger, state-owned companies in China\u2019s manufacturing industry, which employs tens of millions. Taken together, the surveys provide a bleak picture of stubborn weakness in the overall economy. China\u2019s economic growth held steady at 7% in the latest quarter ending in June, which was the weakest performance since the 2008 global crisis. Officials hope to maintain the growth rate for the rest of the year but many economists doubt the target will be met. In the latest attempt to shore up flagging economic growth, China\u2019s communist leaders cut interest rates last week, the fifth time they have done so in nine months. There has also been heavy intervention to shore up the stock market. \u201cThe policies coming out of China with regards to its equity markets are a cat\u2019s cradle of contradictions,\u201d said Angus Nicholson of IG in Melbourne. \u201cReports that China will no longer support the stock market were followed up by clear intervention in the market last Thursday. \u201cIt seems pretty clear that there are deep disagreements at the highest levels of the Chinese government over what to do with the equity markets. The Chinese government is no monolith, and many departments and organisations can pursue policies counter to each other.\u201d The central bank rate cut had been expected after a slew of disappointing recent economic indicators, including a larger-than-expected 8.3% decline in July exports, weak retail sales growth and slowing industrial production and investment. Last month\u2019s business sentiment was also weighed down by sharp declines in China\u2019s stock market and a surprise currency devaluation that roiled markets worldwide and a devastating explosion in the busy port of Tianjin. \u201cRecent volatilities in global financial markets could weigh down on the real economy, and a pessimistic outlook may become self-fulfilling,\u201d said He Fan, Caixin Insight Group\u2019s chief economist. \u201cMacroeconomic regulations and controls must continue and fresh reform measures must be introduced. Fine-tuning should go hand in hand with speedier implementation of structural reform in order to release the full potential of growth and lead the market to confidence.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The small business minister, Bruce Billson, is trying to convince cabinet he can change competition laws to stop big business \u201cabusing\u201d market power, while \u201cappeasing\u201d the powerful Business Council of Australia (BCA) which is implacably opposed and says the move would raise prices and hurt the economy. Cabinet is deeply divided on the issue which pits the biggest companies in the country against the small business \u201cengine room\u201d the government courted with its \u201chave a go\u201d 2015 budget. It did not reach a decision when the competition law changes were first discussed in Adelaide on 4 August, asking Billson \u2013 who has mounted a strident public campaign for change \u2013 to come back with a presentation about the risks and benefits of the plan. Guardian Australia has learned Billson has sent his fellow ministers a slide pack, which makes no formal recommendation, but is understood to argue that his proposed changes could \u201cappease\u201d the BCA and also address its claims that the competition law change would actually hinder competition and hurt consumers. Billson has accused the BCA of peddling \u201cnonsense\u201d about his proposal. Ministers say the organisation and other major corporations are \u201cpulling out all stops\u201d to lobby against the plan. Major companies including Telstra, Bluescope and Qantas are understood to have joined the two big supermarkets, Coles and Woolworths, as well as Wesfarmers and the BCA in a major lobbying campaign to defeat the move \u2013 which was recommended by the Harper review of competition policy. \u201cThe big end of town has gone in really hard on this ... they are pulling out all stops,\u201d one minister said. But several of Billson\u2019s cabinet colleagues \u2013 including treasurer Joe Hockey, attorney general George Brandis, trade minister Andrew Robb, finance minister Mathias Cormann and communications minister Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 are understood to have opposed the move. The Australian Financial Review has reported that BCA leaders left a recent meeting with Tony Abbott with the understanding he backed Billson. After BCA president Catherine Livingstone spoke against the competition law changes, Abbott said \u201cwe will proceed with reforms as we see fit, even if it means changes to competition law\u201d. But sources said the prime minister is now keen to avoid opening another political argument or risk a campaign claiming that it is harming the economy as his government struggles to stay on message. The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, is understood to back Billson\u2019s position. Billson told Guardian Australia on Monday that it was \u201centirely unreasonable for big business to want to dictate the rules about how we make sure that big business does not harm consumers and the economy\u201d. \u201cWe should never lose sight of the fact that these laws are in place to put some bumper rails around the might of these businesses.\u201d The change \u2013 one of 56 recommendations from the Harper review \u2013 is also opposed by Labor, who Billson has accused of \u201cdrinking the BCA Kool-Aid\u201d. The proposed changes to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act would require a small business to prove that the action of a bigger business had the \u201ceffect\u201d of substantially lessening competition, instead of being required to prove that the action had been done with that \u201cpurpose\u201d. The change would also remove a section forbidding a big business from \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of its market power. The BCA says this would significantly widen activities that might be caught by the act. But the changes are vigorously supported by small business and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, independent retailers and the National Farmers\u2019 Federation. The say the change would encourage, rather than diminish, competition and say the claim that it would force price rises is a \u201cfurphy\u201d. They say Billson\u2019s proposed changes would bring Australia into line with other countries and would create a more level playing field.",

The BCA says this would significantly widen activities that might be caught by the act.</p> <p>But the changes are vigorously supported by small business and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, independent retailers and the National Farmers\u2019 Federation.</p> <p>The say the change would encourage, rather than diminish, competition and say the claim that it would force price rises is a \u201cfurphy\u201d. They say Billson\u2019s proposed changes would bring Australia into line with other countries and would create a more level playing field.</p>",
