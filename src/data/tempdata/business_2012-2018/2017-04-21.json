      "bodyText": "The government has recouped the \u00a320.3bn it ploughed into Lloyds Banking Group during the financial crisis, the chancellor has said. Just days after admitting that the taxpayer faced multibillion-pound losses on its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, Philip Hammond said the government had now \u201crecovered every penny of its investment in Lloyds\u201d. Speaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington on Friday, Hammond said the government was \u201cnot in the business of owning banks\u201d and on the brink of selling off the last of its stake. The Treasury is able to make its claim by including \u00a3400m in dividend payments received from Lloyds as well as from selling shares in the bank. It also does not take account of the \u00a33.6bn cost incurred to bail out out the bank, although the Office for Budget Responsibility has said it still expects the government to make \u00a3100m when fees from Lloyds are included. The taxpayer stake stood at 43% at its peak and, according to Hammond, now stands between 1% and 2%. The City expects the remaining shares to be sold in the coming weeks. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the bank\u2019s chief executive, said it was a \u201cmoment of huge pride for all of us at Lloyds\u201d that the government could say it has already reclaimed its money. Even so, it has taken much longer than expected during the financial crisis and has only been possible because Hammond was able to sanction the recent sales at a loss because of profits made from earlier transactions when the share price was higher. The repayment has not been achieved in the way Hammond\u2019s predecessor, George Osborne, envisaged. Osborne promised a discounted share offering to the public which had to be abandoned last year amid market turbulence. Instead, the shares have dripped out to the stock market. Hammond said: \u201cWe are now past the point where we have recovered the taxpayers\u2019 investment. We still hold a small shareholding of between 1-2% but the taxpayer has now recovered every penny of its investment in Lloyds. \u201cRecovering all of the money taxpayers injected into Lloyds marks a significant milestone in our plan to build an economy that works for everyone. While it was right to step in with support during the financial crisis, the government should not be in the business of owning banks in the long term.\u201d On Tuesday, Hammond admitted the Treasury had little hope of selling its 73% stake in RBS above the 502p average price per share paid during the financial crisis. RBS shares were trading around 240p on Friday with Lloyds trading at 64p, below the 73.6p average price paid during the financial crisis. Both banks will publish their results next week for the first three months of 2017. Lloyds has already admitted it will have to take a fresh \u00a3350m hit for the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal \u2013 taking its total bill to more than \u00a317bn.",

Search #unicornfrappuccino on Instagram and you\u2019ll be met with more than 100,000 images \u2013 and those are just the photos that have been hashtagged. The drink isn\u2019t even available in the UK \u2013 but it feels like it\u2019s everywhere.

One barista even posted a video pleading with customers not to order it, because it\u2019s so difficult to make when ordered by customer after customer. \u201cIf you love us as baristas, don\u2019t order it,\u201d said Braden Burson in a now-deleted video. \u201cFor the love of God and everything that is good, don\u2019t get the Unicorn Frappuccino.\u201d The beauty of releasing twee, social media-friendly products is that the marketing is done for you already. Customers will post visually appealing selfies and coffee pics for days, YouTubers will make video reviews and news organisations (hi) will write about it. \u201cThe brain processes visuals faster than text \u2013 marketing and PR people all know this,\u201d said Preena Gadher, co-founder and managing director at Riot Communications. \u201cCreate something that is visually stunning: it\u2019s much more marketable and shareable.

And not everyone was enamoured of the taste: Reviewing it for Newsweek, Chris Riotta wrote: \u201cTo be clear, this is the worst drink I have ever purchased in my life. That is not an understatement, either: the Starbucks Unicorn tastes like a combination of the topical fluoride used by dental hygienists and metallic sludge.\u201d Not that this will hurt Starbucks. \u201cPeople all over the world are talking about it,\u201d said Gadher. \u201cThe drink itself undermines it. In an ideal world it would look good and taste great \u2013 but whether Starbucks cares is another matter. The fact people are having that debate is worth a lot of money.\u201d Starbucks have openly acknowledged that the unicorn drink was inspired by social media. A Starbucks spokesperson said: \u201cThe look of the beverage was an important part of its creation, our inspiration came from the fun, spirited and colourful unicorn-themed food and drinks that have been trending in social media.\u201d As for whether the whole thing was actually Instagram-bait? They were a little more circumspect. But it\u2019s a safe bet this had an influence. Last year a \u201csecret menu\u201d drink called the pink drink, a mix of Starbucks Strawberry Acai Refresher with coconut milk, took over Instagram feeds. This month, they added it to their official menu.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has drawn fire from analysts after it entered the US market by buying two loss-making chains for $101m (\u00a378m). The retailer said on Friday it had received approval from Delaware bankruptcy court to buy 50 stores trading as Bob\u2019s Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports through the bankruptcy process of Eastern Outfitters, the chains\u2019 parent company. Sports Direct, majority owned by its chief executive Mike Ashley, is under pressure after a Guardian investigation in 2015 into its working conditions and investor criticism of its corporate governance standards. Analysts said the US acquisition would distract the company from efforts to lift its UK performance. \u201cWe find the timing extraordinary,\u201d analysts at stockbroker Peel Hunt wrote in a research note, downgrading their investment stance to \u201cadd\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d. \u201cWhat is not required, in our view, is a major, and not inexpensive, distraction, 3,000 miles away.\u201d Analysts at Jefferies, who have a \u201chold\u201d stance, also questioned the timing. \u201cThe incremental challenge of breaking into the US coincides with the need for a drastic UK repositioning and for European stabilisation. This may be a step too far,\u201d they said. Sports Direct issued a profit warning in December after a slide in sterling\u2019s value made it more costly for the firm to source its branded goods from Asia. Last month, it said the devaluation of the euro against the dollar would also hit profit margins. The company has also moved to address corporate governance concerns, announcing this month that it has elected an employee to attend its board meetings. Sports Direct said it had expanded its reach in the US by acquiring the stores, which sell sports and casual wear predominantly, as well as outdoor and camping equipment and clothing. \u201cThe acquisition is expected to complete in the first half of May 2017 and will provide Sports Direct with a footprint in US bricks-and-mortar retail and a platform from which to grow US online sales,\u201d the company said. The US sporting goods sector is being tested by the expansion of online shopping and discount chains. Several retailers filed for bankruptcy in 2016, including Sports Authority, speciality golf retailer Golfsmith International Holdings and sports goods manufacturer Performance Sports Group. The travails of sports shops reflect the American retail sector as a whole, which has been hit by tens of thousands of redundancies in recent months due to online competition.",

      "bodyText": "Vijay Mallya, the multimillionaire co-owner of the Force India Formula One team and self-proclaimed \u201cKing of the Good Times\u201d, does not appear to be preparing for his possible extradition to India to face a fraud trial on allegations over \u00a31bn of unpaid debts. Landscape gardeners were this week laying a truckload of fresh turf in the grounds of his \u00a311.5m mansion in the sleepy Hertfordshire village of Tewin, nearly Welwyn, 20 miles north of London. After the installation of three fountains in one of two garden pools and a four-car garage to house a fraction of his collection of 260 classic cars, the lawn should be the last step in the two-year makeover of his Ladywalk estate on Queen Hoo Lane. The property, previously owned by the father of F1 champion Lewis Hamilton, bristles with so many CCTV cameras (the Guardian counted eight) that a security guard dressed head-to-toe in black appeared at the wrought iron gates before the Guardian even had a chance to ring the bell. \u201cYou can\u2019t come in,\u201d he said. Asked if it was possible to speak to his boss, the guard \u2013 who was working with two colleagues carrying binoculars and iPads showing live feeds of the security cameras \u2013 said only: \u201cHe might be in, he might not be.\u201d Mallya was once known as the \u201cBranson of Bangalore\u201d for his business and sport empire which included beer, spirits and an airline. But his fall from a billionaire playboy \u2013 known for his beer company Kingfisher\u2019s take on the Pirelli calendar and for hosting celebrity parties on his 311ft superyacht Indian Empress during the Monte Carlo grand prix \u2013 to alleged fugitive from justice was completed this week when he was arrested by Scotland Yard on an extradition warrant. The police said Mallya, 61, was arrested on behalf of the Indian authorities in relation to accusations of fraud. The tycoon dismissed the furore surrounding his arrest as \u201cmedia hype\u201d and said his arrest and appearance at Westminster magistrates court was \u201cexpected\u201d before an extradition hearing. He denies the fraud allegations. His security guard refused to answer any more questions as he stood at the gates to the estate, which are flanked by black posts embossed in gold with Mallya\u2019s VJM initials. A Silver Maybach also bears the VJM initials on its number plate, and his private Airbus A319 jet had the initials painted in gold on the engines and wingtips until it was put up for auction to pay his creditors. A sign with a picture of Mallya\u2019s four dogs \u2013 golden retrievers Luna and Bella, and Bichon lapdogs Elsa and Daisy \u2013 urges workmen to drive slowly through the three-house estate. His neighbours know Mallya lives next door but they have not met him and are a little wary of the media after the Indian press corps camped outside the gates for days when it was revealed last year that the businessman was holed up there. India\u2019s prime minister has singled out Mallya, accused of fleeing the country owing about \u00a31bn to banks and employees of his failed Kingfisher Airlines, of ripping off India and Indians. Narendra Modi, who the Indian press said raised Mallya\u2019s extradition with Theresa May during her official visit to the country last year, tweeted: Mallya denies the accusations and tweeted: \u201cNot a rupee was misused.\u201d The landlord of the Rose &amp; Crown on Tewin\u2019s village green said he had not seen Mallya since he and his considerable staff moved to the village but he had heard him. \u201cI don\u2019t know him, I\u2019ve never met him, but I have heard his helicopter flying over,\u201d he said. Several members of the Tewin Thursdays walking group, who were planning this week\u2019s walk over coffee and sourdough toasties at the Country Bumpkin tearoom on Tewin Hill, admitted to being fascinated by Mallya\u2019s presence in the village. \u201cThis is not the most exciting village,\u201d said Chris, a retiree organising this week\u2019s work. \u201cHis [Mallya\u2019s] house used to be owned by Anthony Hamilton, Lewis Hamilton\u2019s dad, so it has always been a talking point. A public footpath runs round the property so we have been able to see all the changes and comings and goings, but he seems to keep very much to himself.\u201d Chris said Mallya\u2019s secretary had expressed interest in joining the walking group, but she had not yet met them for their weekly hike. While many residents said they were happy to have Mallya living in their village, Colin, a retired airline catering manager who lives in a house on the green, said if Mallya was being legitimately sought by the Indian authorities he should \u201cgo back and face the music\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much money you have or how rich you are, you can\u2019t avoid the law,\u201d Colin said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that he is living here in all this luxury if he owes his country money and hasn\u2019t paid his staff wages.\u201d More than 4,000 Kingfisher Airlines employees went without pay for seven months before they revolted and grounded the carrier in October 2012. The staff in the Tewin Stores village shop said Mallya probably has staff to do his shopping and they had not met the billionaire either. But, they said, Mallya had rather incongruously attended a charity barn dance in nearby Bull\u2019s Green. They pointed to a small but welcome act of generosity from the glamorous alleged fraudster last year. When a hit-and-run driver wiped out the village fir tree, which doubled as Tewin\u2019s Christmas tree, the man once estimated by Forbes magazine to have been worth $1.6bn dug deep and donated a replacement. This article was amended on 24 April 2017. Theresa May made an official visit to India last year, but it was not a state visit; these are only carried out by heads of state eg the Queen.",

      "bodyText": "Wall Street is expected to open slightly higher: European markets remain subdued as French voters prepare to go to the polls for the first round of the presidential election on Sunday. France\u2019s CAC 40 is down 0.1% at 5,072, while the FTSE 100 is up 0.1% at 7,124. On that note, we\u2019ll close up for the day. Thank you for reading the blog and for all the comments. Have a good weekend. AM Greece\u2019s primary surplus hit 3.9% last year according to the country\u2019s statistics service, ELSTAT. It was well ahead of expectations. Helena Smith reports from Athens Here in Greece, news of the better-than-expected fiscal performance is being seen as a huge bonus by the leftist-led government, as Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, prepares for crucial talks on the sidelines of the IMF\u2019s annual spring meeting in Washington. Tsakalotos, who meets IMF chief Christine Lagarde at 9am local time, is expected to argue that Greece should be cut some slack after securing a primary surplus of 3.9% in 2016 \u2013 mostly as a result of higher tax collection and massive cuts in public spending. Eurozone countries and the IMF \u2013 funders of the three bailout programmes that have shored up the ailing Greek economy since mid-2010 - are at odds over debt relief and the extent of austerity Athens must apply to achieve future primary budget surpluses once its current bailout ends next year. The disagreement is central to unlocking funds needed to avert default in July when Greece faces over \u20ac7bn in debt repayments. Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP, says the fall in retail sales in March and Q1 shows the government must keep Britain in the single market. Commenting as a supporter of Open Britain, the campaign against a hard Brexit, Umunna said: The government\u2019s intention to take Britain out of the single market and customs union is clearly putting our economy at risk of suffering a hard Brexit downturn. The Brexit vote has already plunged the pound to its lowest value in 30 years, putting up prices in the shops. And leaving the single market and customs union will make prices higher still as imported food, fuel and clothes face new barriers to trade. The government should think again. If they really want to deliver the \u2018exact same benefits\u2019 as membership of the EU, they should keep Britain in the single market and customs union. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, has been speaking at the Federation of Small Businesses in London. He suggested that he is edging closer to voting for a rise in interest rates from the current all-time low of 0.25%. Saunders expects inflation to be higher than the Bank is currently forecasting and said the MPC was not obliged to delay a rate hike until it was clear on the exact terms and impact of Brexit: I judge that the current policy stance is clearly accommodative. While not prejudging what I or the MPC might decide on monetary policy \u2013 a modest rise in rates would still imply that considerable stimulus remains in place, helping to support output and jobs. At the MPC\u2019s most recent meeting, in March, I voted for unchanged policy, especially on the grounds that it would be useful to see a bit more economic data for early 2017. I am not going to announce today how I will vote at the May meeting. There is plenty of data still to receive, and insights to be gained. I do not believe the MPC is necessarily obliged to delay any policy moves until we have certainty over the exact shape of Brexit and its long-run effects on the economy. We make our decisions from meeting to meeting, and will fulfil our remit during the Brexit process and after it. Any policy decision carries risks that subsequent events make the decision controversial, but that is always the case. Time for a market update. France\u2019s CAC 40 is still in the red this afternoon but losses have narrowed considerably ahead of Sunday\u2019s presidential election. Here are the latest scores across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,122 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.4% at 12,074 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,072 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 19,893 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.5% at 10,428 The pound is down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2785 after those weaker-than-expected retail sales. Lukman Otunuga, analyst at the currency broker FXTM, gives his view: Sterling attracted a school of sellers on Friday, following the disappointing 1.8% decline in UK retail sales in March that rekindled fears of Brexit impacting the UK economy. With wage growth lagging behind inflation, concerns may continue to heighten over the longevity of the UK\u2019s prized consumer-driven economic growth. The pound remains gripped by the Brexit developments as they continue moving forward and heightened political uncertainty created from the snap general election shocker should limit extreme upside gains. UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter from 0.7% in the previous quarter, figures published next week are expected to show. That is the view of economists polled by Reuters ahead of the first official snapshot from the ONS on 28 April. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, says that the risks to his forecast for Q1 growth of 0.4% are now to the downside. The sharp fall in retail sales in the first quarter is the clearest sign yet that a UK slowdown is underway, according to Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee. Now a senior economic adviser at PwC, Sentance says: These latest retail sales figures show that the post-Brexit surge in consumer spending has come to an abrupt end. It is not surprising to see consumers reining in their spending. Inflation has caught up with pay growth, so real incomes of workers are no longer rising. Employment growth has also slowed sharply over the past six months, even though unemployment remains historically low. The recent period of strong consumer spending growth also relied on households running down their saving and increasing borrowing. That pattern of behaviour is not sustainable in the longer term and at some point consumers will start to rein in borrowing and rebuild their savings. For all these reasons, we should see these retail sales figures as the start of a period of much weaker consumer spending growth - which will act as a drag on the overall progress of the UK economy over this year and next. This is the clearest indication yet that the expected slowdown in the UK economy has begun, and we should expect to see this confirmed in other economic data over the next few months.\u201d Average shop prices (including fuel), increased by 3.3% over the year to March, which was the sharpest rate of growth since March 2012. The biggest contribution came from petrol stations, where average prices rose by 16.4% year-on-year. The graphic below shows how sales fell as prices rose: Those poor retail sales (down 1.8% in March, and 1.4% over the first quarter) are expected to weigh on UK growth over the first quarter. Consumer spending has been the main driver of growth since the financial crisis, but these figures suggest a growing reluctance to spend as a Brexit-related squeeze on household finances gets underway. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the forecasting group, the EY ITEM Club, says growth could slow to 0.4% or 0.5% in the first quarter of 2017, from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. March\u2019s weakness was broad-based, with department stores the only major sector to see sales volumes increase on the previous month. The likely culprit for this weakness remained a familiar one \u2013 rising shop price inflation. This reached 3.3% year on year in March, a pace not matched since March 2012. With the retail sector accounting for around 5% of GDP, Q1\u2019s decline in sales will have shaved close to 0.1 percentage points off GDP growth in that period. Combined with a poor set of macro data from other sectors, growth looks likely to have slowed from 0.7% in Q4 2016 to around 0.4-0.5%. Looking ahead, the boost to the tradable sector from the weak pound and a buoyant world economy should mitigate weakness on the consumer side. But the dominance of the latter in the economy means that a shift in the source of growth is likely to come at the price of a further slowdown in the pace of expansion. The ONS will publish the first official estimate of first-quarter growth on 28 April. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, says Britain\u2019s retail industry is facing a \u201ctoxic mix\u201d of factors: This latest data shows that the surge in inflation is putting retailers under intense pressure with the first quarterly decline in retail sales since 2013. Families are facing the fastest rise in living costs for over three years and they are reining in their spending rapidly. We\u2019re concerned for the outlook for the retail industry given the toxic mix of rising operating and sourcing costs against a backdrop of weaker consumer demand and heightened political and economic uncertainty. Indeed, recent research conducted by Retail Economics found 43% of consumers suggested they had adopted more cautious spending habits over the last three months citing Brexit and personal finances as their main concerns. Furthermore, we forecast that real earnings are likely to start to shrink by mid-2017 which will put further pressure on the retail industry. In the first quarter overall, UK retail sales fell 1.4%, which was the biggest quarterly fall since 2010. It looks like consumers are less willing to spend now that the impact of the weaker pound is translating into higher shop prices. The pound is currently 14% lower against the dollar than it was on the day of the EU referendum in June. A weaker pound makes goods imported from abroad more expensive. Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, said prices are rising across the board: Today\u2019s retail sales figures show a decline on the month and on the three months to March, which coincides with quarter 1 in 2017. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a quarterly decline since 2013, and it seems to be a consequence of price increases across a whole range of sectors. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says the retail sales figures are \u201cdire\u201d. Breaking: Here in the UK the headline retail sales are a bit of a shocker. The volume of retail sales fell 1.8% between February and March according to the Office for National Statistics, far worse than the 0.2% dip predicted by economists. It was also a big reversal in fortunes compared with the month earlier, when sales were up 1.7% (that was revised up from 1.4%). More soon. Those stronger-than-expected French PMIs have boosted the broader eurozone, helping to drive the PMI for the single currency bloc to a fresh six-year high. Markit\u2019s flash eurozone PMI composite index takes a snapshot of the manufacturing and services indices across the region. The headline index climbed to 56.7 in April from 56.4 and beat expectations of 56.3. While growth in France accelerated, it moderated in Germany. The headline composite index for Germany fell to 56.3 in April from 57.1 in March. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the April PMIs put the eurozone economy on track to grow by 0.7% in the second quarter: The eurozone economy has enjoyed a strong start to the second quarter. The April flash PMI is running at a level consistent with 0.7% GDP growth, up from 0.6% in the first quarter. Such strong growth, if sustained, will inevitably lead to upward revisions to economists\u2019 2017 forecasts. The euro hasn\u2019t been able to hold on to the gains made on Thursday. Having hit a three-week high of $1.077 yesterday, the euro is currently trading at $1.0722. Following Thursday\u2019s surge in French shares - buoyed by forecasts that independent candidate Emmanuel Macron would win the presidential election - investors are more subdued this morning. The CAC 40 is down 0.5%. Here is how markets are looking across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.04% at 7,121 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 12,021 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 5,053 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 19,834 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,382 Markit\u2019s flash French PMI surveys for April have easily beaten expectations, suggesting growth in the private sector accelerated this month. Activity in both the manufacturing and services sector was better than expected, boosting the combined index to 57.4 in April from 56.8, where anything above 50 indicates growth. That was far better than the 56.2 predicted by economists in a Reuters poll, and suggests the French economy was gaining momentum ahead of Sunday\u2019s election. Alex Gill, economist at IHS Markit, said French firms had shrugged off uncertainty posed by the election: The numbers provide further evidence that the French private sector remains resilient to political uncertainty around the upcoming presidential election. Indeed, business optimism hit a multi-year high in April, with a number of respondents anticipating favourable business conditions following its conclusion. This has, in turn, encouraged firms to take on additional staff members.\u201d From the Guardian\u2019s Martin Kettle: Traders at spread betting firm IG are expecting European markets to open higher this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investor minds will be focused on France as voters prepare to head to the polls for the first round of the presidential election on Sunday. The election result is expected to be far-reaching, not only dictating domestic policies in France but potentially determining the future of the EU. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, gives his take on how the markets might digest the result. With all eyes on the first round of the French presidential vote this weekend, the France CAC 40 outperformed yesterday as markets started to price in the prospect of the independent candidate Emmanuel Macron making it through to the second round of voting against Marine Le Pen, or possibly Jean Luc Melenchon who has enjoyed a late surge in the polls. Whether it will be enough to deliver him into the second round is debatable, but markets are starting to price in the prospect that Macron will probably win a contest between either of the other two contenders. Let\u2019s hope he doesn\u2019t get squeezed out, particularly in light of last night\u2019s terrorist attack in Paris, which given the tightness of the polls, could influence events, leaving investors to face the prospect of a face-off between Marine Le Pen on the right and Melenchon on the left. Any such outcome is unlikely to be well received by the markets. Also coming up today... PMI surveys for April will give the earliest indication of how the manufacturing and services sectors in France, Germany, and the wider eurozone were performing at the beginning of the second quarter. Here in the UK retail sales figures for March will offer an insight into whether consumers remained willing to splash out on new purchases despite rising prices.",

Inflation has caught up with pay growth, so real incomes of workers are no longer rising. Employment growth has also slowed sharply over the past six months, even though unemployment remains historically low.</p> <p>The recent period of strong consumer spending growth also relied on households running down their saving and increasing borrowing. That pattern of behaviour is not sustainable in the longer term and at some point consumers will start to rein in borrowing and rebuild their savings.</p> <p>For all these reasons, we should see these retail sales figures as the start of a period of much weaker consumer spending growth - which will act as a drag on the overall progress of the UK economy over this year and next.</p> <p>This is the clearest indication yet that the expected slowdown in the UK economy has begun, and we should expect to see this confirmed in other economic data over the next few months.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58f9d5fde4b05b487c0e464a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-21T10:13:22.654Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Average shop prices (including fuel), increased by 3.3% over the year to March, which was the sharpest rate of growth since March 2012.</strong></p> <p>The biggest contribution came from petrol stations, where average prices rose by 16.4% year-on-year. <br></p> <p>The graphic below shows how sales fell as prices rose:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd6d306a785aeca0105fd596f1b42add83a454ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd6d306a785aeca0105fd596f1b42add83a454ae/0_0_773_542/500.jpg\" alt=\"ONS retail sales March 2017\" width=\"500\" height=\"351\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-21T10:13:43.557Z\">at 11.13am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58f9d144e4b05b487c0e462e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-21T09:41:23.518Z\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK growth 'to slow' after weak Q1 retail sales</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Those poor retail sales (down 1.8% in March, and 1.4% over the first quarter) are expected to weigh on UK growth over the first quarter.</strong></p> <p>Consumer spending has been the main driver of growth since the financial crisis, but these figures suggest a growing reluctance to spend as a Brexit-related squeeze on household finances gets underway.</p> <p><strong>Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the forecasting group, the EY ITEM Club, says growth could slow to 0.4% or 0.5% in the first quarter of 2017, from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>March\u2019s weakness was broad-based, with department stores the only major sector to see sales volumes increase on the previous month. The likely culprit for this weakness remained a familiar one \u2013 rising shop price inflation. This reached 3.3% year on year in March, a pace not matched since March 2012.<br></p> <p>With the retail sector accounting for around 5% of GDP, Q1\u2019s decline in sales will have shaved close to 0.1 percentage points off GDP growth in that period. Combined with a poor set of macro data from other sectors, growth looks likely to have slowed from 0.7% in Q4 2016 to around 0.4-0.5%. </p> <p>Looking ahead, the boost to the tradable sector from the weak pound and a buoyant world economy should mitigate weakness on the consumer side.

      "bodyText": "The strong recovery on Britain\u2019s high streets after last year\u2019s Brexit vote appears to be over, with retail sales figures for the first quarter showing the biggest drop in purchases in the last seven years. The Office for National Statistics said UK retail sales fell 1.4% in the first three months of 2017, the biggest quarterly fall since 2010. Evidence of a steep decline in recent months was emphasised by the month-on-month figure, which has fallen for four out of the last five months and declined by 1.8% in March (or by 1.5% when fuel sales were excluded). A dry spell for the housing market \u2013 which has had almost a year of lacklustre sales, according to surveyors\u2019 body Rics \u2013 was blamed for a steep fall in sales of household goods and furniture. The slump comes as the political parties fire their opening salvoes in the general election campaign. Theresa May has indicated she will focus on her ability to deliver the benefits of Brexit, in part from the lower value of the pound. Analysts said consumers were less willing to spend now the impact of weaker sterling was translating into higher shop prices. The pound is 14% lower against the dollar than it was on the day of the referendum in June when the UK voted to leave the European Union. Weaker sterling makes goods imported from abroad more expensive, which is a big blow to the retail sector when Britain imports most of its food and runs a large deficit in goods with the rest of he world. Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, said prices were rising across the board. Average shop prices (including fuel) increased by 3.3% in the year to March, which was the sharpest rate of growth since March 2012. The biggest contribution came from petrol stations, where average prices rose by 16.4% year-on-year. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who is a leading supporter of the lobby group Open Britain, said: \u201cThe Brexit vote has already plunged the pound to its lowest value in 30 years, putting up prices in the shops. And leaving the single market and customs union will make prices higher still, as imported food, fuel and clothes face new barriers to trade.\u201d Andrew Sentance, a senior economic adviser at PwC, said a nine-month recovery on the high street had hit the buffers. \u201cThese latest retail sales figures show that the post-Brexit surge in consumer spending has come to an abrupt end,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not surprising to see consumers reining in their spending. Inflation has caught up with pay growth, so real incomes of workers are no longer rising. Employment growth has also slowed sharply over the past six months, even though unemployment remains historically low.\u201d Simon Wells, chief European economist at HSBC, said the unexpectedly sharp contraction in March showed \u201cconsumers are feeling the pinch\u201d, while Victoria Clarke, UK economist at Investec, said it would drag first-quarter GDP growth down to 0.4%, from 0.7% in the last three months of 2016. But Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, was more upbeat and said the figures most likely overstated the weakness in overall household spending growth that was typical in the first quarters. \u201cRetail sales only account for about a third of household spending, and the recent evidence on other areas of spending has been more encouraging. For example, the Bank of England\u2019s agents\u2019 score of consumer services turnover has held steady at a fairly high level,\u201d she said. The ONS found that shoppers bought fewer goods \u201cacross all retail sectors except textile, clothing and footwear stores where sales volume increased by 1.9%\u201d. It said the largest decreases were among stores selling household goods and fuel \u2013 at 3.3% and 3.1% respectively. These were offset to some extent by internet sales, it added. \u201cAnecdotal evidence from textile, clothing and footwear retailers suggests that increases in internet sales have contributed to growth. When comparing March 2017 with March 2016, internet sales in textile, clothing and footwear stores have increased by 28.1% \u2013 the largest year-on-year increase since August 2014,\u201d it said. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 April 2017. Retail sales have fallen in four out of the past five months, not for the last five consecutive months, as stated in an earlier version.",

    "webTitle": "Reactor goes here ... the \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C starts to take shape", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Surrounded by a sea of broken rock and mounds of earth on the Somerset coast stands a small, unassuming sign that states simply \u201cR2\u201d. It is here that the second of two nuclear reactors will switch on in the middle of the next decade if all goes according to EDF Energy\u2019s plan for Hinkley Point C, proving that Britain can still build new nuclear power stations and, more importantly, providing 7% of the country\u2019s electricity. Only nine months ago the entire \u00a318bn Hinkley project was at risk, after Theresa May ordered a review into China\u2019s involvement. But since the French state-owned firm and UK government signed a generous 35-year subsidy deal in September, construction has started in earnest. The new reactors are being built adjacent to the existing Hinkley Point A and B nuclear power stations, on what was until recently green fields bordering the Bristol channel. Today it looks more like Mordor, from Lord of the Rings, a scarred landscape and hive of activity driven with a single purpose: ensuring these reactors do not repeat the delays and overspends on the other two European projects using EDF\u2019s Hinkley reactor design, at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland. \u201cI think this is by far the most complex thing the country has tried to do,\u201d said Nigel Cann, programme and construction delivery director at EDF, as he surveyed the near 500-acre (2 sq km) site. But he is adamant that they will avoid the problems encountered in Finland and France. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the contractor in very early, that\u2019s a lesson we\u2019ve learned from Flamanville,\u201d he said. Compared to Olkiluoto, where engineers had problems pumping concrete which was too thick, Cann said Hinkley has \u201cstolen a march\u201d by getting the process lined up much earlier. The other weapon in his arsenal is 4D modelling \u2013 3D modelling over time \u2013 which was not available when construction began in Finland in 2005. Such technology is vital because so much is being crammed into a relatively small space. The sprawling site will be crowded with 52 tower cranes when construction is its peak, up from two now. The site already has the first of three huge concrete batching plants, where concrete mixing lorries queue. A seawall is being built along the coast, next to the steel pilings that will form a 500m temporary jetty to bring in construction materials such as sand and gravel. Vast piles of earth and rock abound \u2013 3m cubic metres of an eventual 6m has already been excavated, most of it heading to a valley next door. The first concrete has begun to be poured for the arteries underneath the power station, carrying cables for power, pipes for water and more. Building almost a mile of these underground galleries is Cann\u2019s \u201cbig ticket\u201d goal for the end of the year, with five miles to be finished in total. But Hinkley Point C is big in other ways. It involves so many people that much of the current construction is to provide facilities to accommodate and feed them. Around 1,800 are working on the project now, rising to a predicted peak of 5,600. A 1,500-bed temporary hotel is being built to house workers in a \u00a350m contract with a Nottingham firm. New offices are being thrown up. An internal bus service ferries people around the site, while a 100-strong security force run by G4S patrols it. One of the more unusual jobs is harbourmaster, although most of the work here now involves steel, concrete and earthworks. \u201cI just wanted to spread my wings a bit really, move out my mum\u2019s house and come down here,\u201d said Ben Lewis, a 23-year-old from North Yorkshire, who is working on steel to reinforce the concrete. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a turbulent time for Hinkley, so it\u2019s good that it\u2019s up and running.\u201d Both Lewis and Garth Young, a 31-year-old steel fixer supervisor, bought their first homes in the nearby countryside when they first landed jobs here. The subsequent hiatus on the project last year came as \u201cquite a shock\u201d, Young said, and the pair took work in London before coming back. Many here on site are veterans of another mega construction project, London\u2019s Crossrail, and \u2013 given Hinkley\u2019s location \u2013 a good number are Welsh. Half of the workforce are locals, defined as people within a 90-minute travel radius. The next generation of workers destined for Hinkley are up the road at Bridgwater &amp; Taunton College, which is part-funded by EDF. Molly Burns-Lalic, 23, is the first of a cohort studying for a fee-free degree in quantity surveying and commercial management. \u201cIt\u2019s a growing industry, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019re all fairly local, and it\u2019s a big thing round here,\u201d she said of nuclear power\u2019s appeal. \u201cI never went to uni, so this course gives me a degree without having to go to uni and have all the debt.\u201d While the construction workers preparing the site now are paid about \u00a345,000 on average, not all are happy. Unions raised the threat of delays amid a dispute over bonuses between unions and EDF\u2019s main civil contractor, the French-British consortium Bylor. \u201cEDF have kicked the can down the road long enough on this bonus issue on civil construction. They now need to negotiate,\u201d said Phil Whitehurst, national officer for construction at GMB . Unions are consulting soon on whether to ballot for a strike. EDF said it is \u201ccommitted to a continuing dialogue\u201d and Cann expects an agreement to be reached within a fortnight. At the entrance to Hinkley Point C, an electronic clock marks the 720 days until \u201cJ0\u201d, jour/day zero, the moment when the first reactor\u2019s foundation is due to be poured. EDF executives will be watching the industrial dispute anxiously, hoping they don\u2019t have to put back the date. Hinkley Point\u2019s potential pitfalls Concrete EDF has already built dummy buildings on the Hinkley construction site using nuclear grade concrete, to ensure it gets it right when it comes to building the project\u2019s \u201cnuclear island\u201d in two years\u2019 time. But the experience in Finland, while not a project run by EDF, suggests this could still prove tricky. Brexit Any post-EU restrictions on freedom of movement could affect Hinkley and its highly specialised work, as the EDF chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, alluded to recently. The UK\u2019s decision to leave the Euratom nuclear cooperation treaty while exiting the EU could also throw a spanner in the works. New bilateral deals must be put in place to ensure nuclear materials can continue to arrive in the UK. Manufacturing EDF\u2019s nuclear building partner, Areva, has come in for unusually strong criticism from the UK nuclear regulator over irregularities at a key forge in France that was set to make parts for Hinkley. However, De Rivaz has said the forge\u2019s problems will have \u201cno impact\u201d on Hinkley. EDF also has the option of using another forge in Japan. Unions The Unite union has described the bonus rate on offer for workers as \u201cderisory\u201d and insufficient to attract and hold on to the quality of workers that Hinkley needs for the project to be delivered on time. It remains to be seen whether the row will escalate. Politics The unexpected election of a Labour government would likely have little impact \u2013 the party supports new nuclear power stations \u2013 but the French presidential election could. Marine Le Pen\u2019s aides recently said that if she won, she would review the contract for Hinkley Point C and look for exit options, to allow EDF to concentrate on nuclear projects at home.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An investigation by the UK media regulator into Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn takeover of Sky has been delayed until after the general election. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, was set to receive the findings of two Ofcom investigations, examining whether the takeover gives Murdoch too much control of UK news media and whether he is a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner, by 16 May. Theresa May\u2019s decision to call a snap general election on 8 June means the deadline has now been extended to 20 June. Under government rules governing \u201cpurdah\u201d \u2013 the period immediately before elections, which in this case is due to start at midnight on 21 April \u2013 Bradley is not allowed to make a decision on the report. \u201cGiven the proximity of this decision to the forthcoming general election and following discussions with the parties, Ofcom, the Competition and Markets Authority and the Cabinet Office propriety and ethics team I wrote to Ofcom and the CMA on Friday 21 April to extend the period by which these reports should be submitted to Tuesday 20 June,\u201d said Bradley. According to the Cabinet Office\u2019s guidance to ministers and civil servants, \u201clarge and/or contentious [decisions] on which a new government might be expected to want the opportunity to take a different view from the present government, should be postponed until after the election\u201d. After Bradley receives Ofcom\u2019s report she will have to decide whether to refer 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid to takeover the 61% of Sky it does not already own to the competition authorities for further scrutiny. During Murdoch\u2019s previous bid in 2010, which was scrapped because of the fallout from the phone-hacking scandal that engulfed his UK newspapers, the then culture secretary Jeremy Hunt accepted an offer to spin off Sky News to allay the media plurality issues Ofcom raised. This time round James Murdoch, the chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, has said that he does not believe that the company will need to make any meaningful concessions to complete the takeover. Critics say that the bid raises plurality issues because it will give Fox News owner Murdoch control of Sky, which owns Sky News, operations in Germany and Italy and UK newspapers including the Sun and Times. The UK newspapers are owned through News Corp, a separate company which was set up after the previous bid was aborted as the home of Murdoch\u2019s global newspaper and publishing assets. Opponents also say that the phone-hacking scandal \u2013 and more recent revelations about impropriety at Fox News that resulted in the departure of its top executive Roger Ailes and separately the broadcaster Bill O\u2019Reilly \u2013 mean that Fox is not \u201cfit and proper\u201d to own a UK broadcasting licence for Sky. \u201cWith scandal engulfing Fox in the US and the history of phone hacking in Britain, the government knows the Murdoch brand is politically toxic,\u201d said Bert Wander, director at campaigning group Avaaz. \u201cOfcom should use the extra time to consider new evidence of why the Murdochs are not fit to own Sky.\u201d Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn bid was cleared by the European competition regulator earlier this month. \u201cWe are confident that a thorough review of our track record over 30 years will underscore our commitment to upholding high broadcast standards, and will demonstrate that the transaction will not result in there being insufficient plurality in the UK,\u201d a spokeswoman for Fox said.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Burberry have slumped after the luxury brand revealed that strong sales in the UK and China had failed to offset a slowdown in the US and Hong Kong. Burberry\u2019s share price slid nearly 8% on Wednesday amid investor disappointment that the British label had not echoed the bullish performance of Louis Vuitton owner LVMH last week which had appeared to herald a turnaround in the luxury market. Underlying retail sales rose 2% in the three months to 31 March, compared with growth of 3% in the previous quarter, as demand in the US fell, partly as a result of a pull back on promotional offers. The relative strength of the dollar during the period also encouraged Americans to shop abroad. Analysts are now concerned that the benefits Burberry has enjoyed from the low value of the pound will disappear given the recent rise in sterling ahead of the UK general election. Total revenues slid 1% to \u00a31.6bn on an underlying basis but rose 14% once the benefits of changing exchange rates were included. Analysts at Liberum said: \u201cNews of a snap UK election has seen a strong rally in the pound. Should this continue towards polling day Burberry\u2019s own, FX-driven rally could disintegrate.\u201d Burberry said it had enjoyed an \u201cexceptional\u201d performance in the UK, where tourists are taking advantage of the low value of the pound to pick up bargain bags and trench coats. Julie Brown, chief operating and financial officer, told analysts that UK sales were up by nearly 40% in the six-month period. However, sales in Hong Kong, Korea and the Middle East all fell as a result of local factors including travel restrictions and the falling oil price. This came alongside a 5% decline in sales in the Americas. Beauty wholesale revenues also fell by about 20% as the company continued to rationalise its distribution after taking its cosmetics and perfume business in-house in 2013. The company, famed for its trenchcoats and distinctive check patterns, is expected to make redundancies in its beauty division after signing a licence agreement with US beauty firm Coty earlier this month, a major U-turn after paying \u20ac181m to end a previous licence relationship with Interparfums four years ago. The deal comes as Christopher Bailey, chief creative and executive officer, prepares to hand over the chief executive role to former C\u00e9line boss, Marco Gobbetti, in July. Gobbetti is already at Burberry but has begun by heading up its Asian business because of other contractual commitments. Bailey said: \u201cIn an uncertain environment, we continue to take action to strengthen the brand and reposition Burberry for growth. The outperformance of fashion and the strong customer response to new products underline our renewed creative momentum ... As we build on our progress so far, we remain confident about Burberry\u2019s prospects in the longer term.\u201d",

Sky has commissioned the new experience, called Hold the World, which it says is a marriage of interactive video game technology and TV documentary. The public will be able to take the tour, which offers an up close and personal experience with fossils, bones and skulls, with insights from Attenborough, if they have a VR set, controller and phone app. \u201cHold the World offers people a unique opportunity: to examine rare objects, some millions of years old,\u201d Attenborough said. \u201cIt represents an extraordinary new step in how people can explore and experience nature, all from the comfort of their own homes.\u201d Sky, which has plans for 12 VR film projects and released two linked to its Formula One coverage, wants to showcase the potential and bolster the popularity of the technology. \u201cVR and augmented reality have good long-term potential in the market,\u201d said the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch. Sky also announced the launch of a global production partnership with HBO, maker of Game of Thrones, with a $250m (\u00a3195m) initial investment to make high-end dramas. The business, which aims to produce about two major series a year, is at least partly a response to the billions of investment in quality programming made by newer entrants such as Netflix. \u201cThis will give us an ongoing slate of high-quality drama to exploit at home and globally,\u201d said Darroch. \u201cHopefully it will mean we can create take a lot of our high end drama to the next level.\u201d Sky has a separate existing deal to exclusively air HBO programming, such as Billions and Game of Thrones, which runs until 2020. Sky reported an 11% decline in operating profits to \u00a31bn in the nine months to the end of March. Its UK business, which accounts for almost all of its profits, fell by 20%, from \u00a31.15bn to \u00a3918m. The broadcaster partly blamed the drop on a major increase in Premier League rights payments, which have ballooned to \u00a3494m this year in line with the start of its new \u00a34.2bn three-year contract. Darroch said a significant increase in total revenues, which have grown 11% to \u00a39.6bn in the nine months to March, and cost savings helped it tabsorb the higher programming bill, which pushed total costs up 8% to \u00a38.6bn. Stripping out currency effects Sky\u2019s revenues rose by 5% year on year for the nine-month period. The company said it had battled a tough UK ad market, which fell by 8% in the first quarter of this year, outperforming the conditions with its ad revenues down by just 3% in its home market. TV ad revenues across Sky\u2019s total business, which includes operations in Germany, Austria and Italy, grew by 4% to \u00a3613m in the nine months. Sky said its German operation performed strongly: its profits of \u00a34m mark the first time the business has been in the black at the nine-month stage. Its Italian operation produced its fastest rate of revenue growth in eight years, up 7% to \u00a31.8bn for the nine months, as profits tripled year on year to \u00a391m.",

      "bodyText": "Multinational energy group Chevron has been left with an increased tax bill of $340m after losing an appeal in a landmark profit-shifting case. The full federal court unanimously upheld a decision on Friday that Chevron engaged in transfer pricing by paying a higher rate of interest on a loan from its subsidiary to shift profits from Australia to the United States. The decision will bolster the efforts of the Australian Taxation Office to crack down on profit-shifting through hundreds of billions of dollars of related-party loans by multinationals. Chevron has reserved its right to appeal to the high court. The tax dispute relates to an assessment by the ATO that increased Chevron\u2019s tax bill for the years 2004 to 2008 by $340m, which was upheld by the federal court in October. The federal court found that a US entity was set up to borrow funds at a rate of 1.2% to lend them to its Australian parent, Chevron Australia Holdings Pty Ltd, at an interest rate of about 9%. Justice Tony Pagone said the effect of the internal financing structure was to reduce Chevron\u2019s Australian taxable income by claiming interest payments as deductions. Justice James Allsop agreed with the trial judge that the $2.5bn loan was chosen because it \u201cwas the most tax efficient corporate capital structure and gave the best after tax result for the Chevron group\u201d. Allsop said that if the loan between the related parties had been independent and at arm\u2019s length, Chevron would have provided a guarantee over the loan, securing finance at a rate \u201csignificantly below 9%\u201d. Jason Ward, a spokesman for the Tax Justice Network, said the decision was \u201can important victory for the ATO and the Australian people\u201d. \u201cIt sends a clear message to Chevron and other multinationals that these tax dodging schemes will no longer be tolerated. \u201cWe hope this will force Chevron to restructure their current $42bn loan so that Australians won\u2019t be cheated out of tens of billions in future tax revenue in a scheme even more damaging than the one in this court case.\u201d A spokesman for Chevron said the company was disappointed with the court\u2019s decision. \u201cWe will review the decision to determine next steps, which may include an appeal to the High Court of Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cAs recognised by the trial court in the dispute, the financing is a legitimate business arrangement and the parties differ only in their assessments of the appropriate interest rate to apply.\u201d In December 2016, a Tax Justice Network analysis of ATO data showed that for the second year running Chevron had paid no corporate tax. The Chevron spokesman said the company \u201cpays a substantial amount of tax in Australia\u201d, citing payroll and fringe benefits tax among others, including royalties \u2013 which are not a tax but the price paid for resources. \u201cSince 2009, we\u2019ve paid almost $4bn in federal and state taxes and royalties,\u201d he said. Ward said the decision should spur the government to reform the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax because \u201cif Chevron is proven to have rigged their income-tax payments, why would they not do the same on the profit based PRRT tax?\u201d.",
