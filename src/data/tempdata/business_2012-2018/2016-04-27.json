      "bodyText": "Cars rolled off British production lines at the rate of one every 16 seconds in March, pushing UK car manufacturing to a 12-year high for a first quarter. UK factories produced 443,581 cars in the first three months of the year, up 10.3% on same quarter last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It was the strongest first-quarter performance since 2004. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the UK\u2019s reputation as a good place to make cars was helping to increase investment and productivity in the industry. He added: \u201cWe are on a trajectory to reach record levels of car manufacturing by 2020.\u201d Industry forecasts suggest the previous annual production record of 1.9m cars, set in 1972, would be broken within four years, slightly later than previously expected. Hawes said that to reach such a level output would require the creation of about 37,000 jobs. He added that the appetite for British-made cars was increasing abroad, partly as demand recovers in Europe. About three-quarters of the cars built in UK factories in the first three months of this year were exported. \u201cMuch will depend on economic and political conditions in key markets but, with several brand new global models starting production here in the first quarter alone, the prospects for future growth look bright,\u201d Hawes said. Companies committed to invest a total of \u00a32.5bn in UK car production last year alone, he said. This year Aston Martin announced it would open a new factory in south Wales, creating more than 750 jobs. The luxury car maker plans to build its new DBX crossover model at a plant in St Athan from 2020. This followed a global search for a new manufacturing facility. Major UK car plants include Nissan\u2019s factory in Sunderland, the Mini factory in Oxford and Toyota at Burnaston in Derbyshire. The strong car manufacturing figures \u2013 which showed a 9.8% jump to 159,074 vehicles in March \u2013 were at odds with data for the wider economy on Wednesday. The Office for National Statistics said UK growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2016, from 0.6% in the previous three months. Manufacturing output fell by 0.4% over the period. Hawes said that should the UK vote to leave the EU, the effects in the UK car industry would be felt over the medium to longer term, rather than the short term, because of the lengthy product cycles. \u201cThe industry has been very successful and the referendum is clearly going to deliver a period of uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concern would be for the medium to long term. If we leave and it adds to costs, that would make the UK less competitive. \u201cWe have been hugely successful and we don\u2019t want to jeopardise that success.\u201d The trade body said productivity in UK car manufacturing was at record levels. Referring to data from the SMMT and the ONS, it said figures for 2015 showed that each worker generated on average \u00a379,700 a car produced, up 1.3% on 2014. This was the highest on record, and abound twice the UK national average. Hawes said that with investment came innovation in processes, leading to greater efficiency and competitiveness, and higher levels of productivity.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears about Britain\u2019s potential departure from the EU are putting off international firms from investing in UK offices and shops, and some are considering relocating in the event of a leave vote \u2013 with Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin likely to benefit. A report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) shows that there has been a steady easing in international demand for UK office, industrial and retail property since the referendum was confirmed last spring. Nearly 40% of RICS members across the UK said that in the first quarter of 2016 international retailers and others were reducing investment in the UK ahead of the June referendum. In London, 80% said that uncertainty around the outcome was holding back investment. Demand from international investors for UK offices and shops has fallen sharply, with just 5% of RICS firms reporting increased interest from overseas companies over the last three months, compared with 36% a year ago. The organisation said some international firms were drawing up contingency plans to shift their headquarters in the event of Brexit. Overseas firms based in the UK occupy large swathes of real estate, and their departure could harm office occupancy rates, and the local economy. Likely beneficiaries of a Brexit are Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin, although the report said London was likely to remain a magnet for investment. Investment rates have eased, but not frozen. Housing and planning minister Brandon Lewis said: \u201cWe have a strong and growing economy but as this report shows major international businesses are postponing investment because of fears of Britain leaving the EU. On 23 June there will be a clear choice between economic security and global influence in remaining in the EU, or a leap in the dark and further uncertainty.\u201d The RICS report also said that house prices were likely to fall, should the UK opt for Brexit, as a significant number of higher end properties, especially in London and the south east, are bought by Europeans and people from outside the EU. It said: \u201cBrexit could see less demand for higher end properties as highly paid executives could follow their headquarters to mainland Europe ... We can, therefore, suggest house prices could decrease in the immediate to short term.\u201d HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver said in February that the lender would probably move about 1,000 investment bankers to Paris if Britain pulls out of the EU, a day after the bank decided to keep its headquarters in London. Britain\u2019s housing crisis could worsen if the flow of construction workers from the EU dries up \u2013 10-12% come from outside the UK, and on average eight different languages are spoken on site, said Simon Light of design and consultancy firm Arcadis. Housebuilders have long struggled with shortages of skilled workmen, which has driven up construction costs. Some 43% of RICS member firms said Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU would have a negative impact on commercial property and only 6% saw a positive impact, with the rest seeing a limited impact (38%) or replying \u2018do not know\u2019 (12%). In central London, not a single respondent felt Brexit would be positive, and 60% viewed leaving the EU as a negative. RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said: \u201cThere is no doubt that since the EU referendum became a certainty following the general election last May we have seen a decline in interest from overseas investors in UK commercial property. At least in the short term, we know that international retailer and service providers are finding the UK market less attractive.\u201d The report also suggested that British farmers, many of which rely on payments from the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy to pay their rents, would take a big hit in the event of a leave vote. CAP payments amount to \u20ac3.1bn a year and 60% of UK food exports go to the EU, while 70% of food imports come from the trading bloc. Separately, analysts at the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s credit rating agency said a leave vote could lead to a price crash, reversing the gains in property values seen in recent years, with London most affected and the commercial market more heavily impacted than the housing market, in particular from financial firms scaling back office investments. They warned about the risks for housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey, which has 30% of its building projects in London or surrounding areas, and Grainger that relies the London region for more than a fifth of its revenues.",

      "bodyText": "Shareholders are being urged to use the annual general meetings of Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline to put pressure on the companies to lower the price of their life-saving pneumonia vaccines. ShareAction, the responsible investment charity, issued the call ahead of Pfizer\u2019s AGM in New York on Thursday, and GSK\u2019s annual meeting in London next week. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) has just delivered petitions to both companies asking them to lower their vaccine prices to $5 (\u00a33.43) for each child in developing countries, and plans to raise the issue at both AGMs. Pneumonia is the single largest cause of death for children under five globally and kills almost 1 million children a year, it is estimated. The two pharmaceutical companies have dominated the market for the main pneumococcal vaccines for years. Pfizer and the British company GSK have come under growing pressure from more than 50 countries and international health charities to reduce the high price of pneumococcal vaccines. The price tag was the main reason why the cost of fully vaccinating a child was now 68 times more expensive than it was in 2001, ShareAction said. Ten vaccines are on the World Health Organisation schedule. Pneumococcal vaccines were added to the childhood vaccination schedule in 2006. Pfizer had made more than $26bn in sales from pneumonia treatments since 2009 while GSK had made $3.5bn in that period, ShareAction said. GSK\u2019s latest results, published on Wednesday, showed that vaccine sales were strong in the first three months of this year, rising 23% to \u00a3882m, with sales of its pneumonia vaccine Synflorix up 48% to \u00a391m. MSF said that a small number of countries could get the pneumonia vaccines for $9 for three doses under the Gavi Alliance (a global health partnership), which is backed by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Unicef and the WHO. For other countries the price could be at least six times higher. GSK said it was one of the largest contributors of vaccines to Gavi for treating several diseases, and had been offering Synflorix to the alliance at a \u201cdeeply discounted\u201d price since 2010. It has lowered its price to Gavi, to $3.05 per dose from 2017 \u2013 a level which just covered its cost, the drugs firm said. It added that its pneumococcal vaccine was one of the most complex it had ever manufactured, essentially combining 10 vaccines in one. However, Greg Elder, medical coordinator for MSF\u2019s access campaign, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of a life-saving vaccine if the most vulnerable people can\u2019t afford it?\u201d ShareAction criticised the opaque pricing of both companies\u2019 vaccines, which made it hard for countries to negotiate. Catherine Howarth, the charity\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThese two pharmaceutical giants are found in many global investment portfolios. Our latest briefing brings their vaccine pricing tactics to investors\u2019 attention.\u201d The \u20ac165bn Dutch pension fund PFZW has indicated that it will push for more affordable drugs, arguing that drugs manufacturers had a \u201csocial responsibility to price their products reasonably\u201d. Hillary Clinton has slammed the \u201cpredatory pricing\u201d of some companies and vowed to limit the amount they can charge for their drugs if she wins in the US presidential elections. Cheaper pneumonia vaccines, made by the Serum Institute of India, and South Korea\u2019s Panacea and SK Chemicals in partnership with France\u2019s Sanofi healthcare company, are set to come on to the market from 2018. Countries including Algeria, Bosnia, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Thailand and Tunisia, among others, have said they are unable to introduce the pneumonia vaccine because of its high price, MSF noted. Vickie Hawkins, executive director of MSF UK, said: \u201cWhilst the price of the pneumonia vaccine is clearly making a profit for GSK shareholders, it\u2019s failing three-quarters of the world\u2019s children. They remain unprotected against this deadly disease as a number of countries can\u2019t afford to buy the vaccine \u2013 2,500 children will die from pneumonia today.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lord Myners, the man who fought off Sir Philip Green\u2019s bid for Marks &amp; Spencer, has filed 11 questions in the House of Lords calling on the government to investigate the demise of BHS. Myners, who was the bitter adversary of Green as chairman of M&amp;S between 2004 and 2006 when the former BHS owner attempted a \u00a310bn takeover, has said the government should look into the events leading up to BHS being put into administration this week, and the role of the pension trustees. BHS collapsed into administration on Monday putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving a \u00a3571m pension black hole. Myners asks the government to review decisions taken by regulators and trustees about the funding of the scheme and to estimate the likely impact of the additional costs of supporting the pensions lifeboat, a body funded by business levies which is likely to have to take on BHS\u2019s pension deficit. Myners also suggests the government review \u201cthe effectiveness of the recommendations on public sector procurement\u201d made by Green in a 2010 report ordered by David Cameron. The queries were filed as MPs confirmed they will call Green to give evidence at a parliamentary inquiry into the impact of BHS\u2019s pension liability on the Pension Protection Fund and whether pensions regulation is working. Frank Field MP, chair of the work and pensions committee which will carry out the inquiry, said: \u201cWe need as a committee to look at the Pension Protection Fund and how the receipt of pension liabilities of BHS will impact on the increases in the levy that will now be placed on all other eligible employers to finance the scheme. \u201cWe will then need to judge whether the law is strong enough to protect future pensioners\u2019 contracts in occupational schemes.\u201d Chancellor George Osborne told ITV News that \u201cindependent bodies\u201d should investigate the situation at BHS but would not be drawn on whether its billionaire ex-boss has questions to answer. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 a year ago to a little-known group of investors led by former bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Both are under pressure to explain how the 88-year-old high street retailer fell into administration, putting 11,000 jobs at risk, and built up a large pension deficit after they took millions of pounds of out of the company. Chappell moved \u00a31.5m from the retailer into an obscure corporate vehicle only last week as its financial problems worsened. He paid back all but \u00a350,000, telling BHS management that this represented the cost of transferring the money into Swedish krona and back again. The future of BHS hangs in the balance as administrators for the retailer consider up to 50 expressions of interest. Sources said there were just six serious bidders interested in taking a large number of the group\u2019s stores. Those buyers are thought to include Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day, Sports Direct, B&amp;M Stores and Primark. It\u2019s also understood that Chappell is considering a bid for the company. He told the Guardian: \u201cWe have some angles and we have a reasonable chance of getting a bid in.\u201d But a BHS spokesman has said: \u201cAny suggestion Dominic Chappell could be successful in an attempt to regain control of BHS is pure fantasy.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Federal Reserve hints at June interest rate hike with new faith in US economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "US interest rates will remain unchanged until at least June, the Federal Reserve\u2019s open market committee (FOMC) announced on Wednesday. Signaling faith in the strengthening US economy, the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee softened its language regarding the global economy\u2019s impact and implied openness to raising interest rates in the near future. On Wednesday, the US central bank left interest rates unchanged at 0.25% to 0.5% for a third time this year. After the Fed raised rates from near zero for the first time in almost a decade in December, it was expected to hike rates four times this year. Since then, the forecast has been adjusted to just two hikes in 2016. In its statement, the FOMC noted that it \u201cexpects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate\u201d. \u201cFed officials, including chair Janet Yellen, have expressed worries about a softening of economic growth so far this year, anemic and fragile global economic growth, a strong dollar and financial market volatility,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \u201cYet the labor market continues to impress, with a strong rate of job creation being sustained in recent months, and consumer sentiment remains elevated.\u201d Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist with High Frequency Economics, expected the Fed\u2019s \u201ctone to be a bit more positive than in March, consistent with another rate hike in June if \u2013 and only if \u2013 the data and markets are supportive\u201d. Among the data considered by the Fed is GDP growth, the strength of the US jobs market, and inflation. The Fed did not disappoint and in its statement signaled faith in the US economy. \u201cLabor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed,\u201d the FOMC said on Wednesday. \u201cGrowth in household spending has moderated, although households\u2019 real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high.\u201d And while US job gains were described as strong, the Fed did note that it expects inflation to remain low. More importantly, Wednesday\u2019s statement no longer included language it had used in the past noting that \u201cglobal economic and financial developments continue to pose risks\u201d. Instead, the committee only said that it continues to \u201cclosely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments\u201d. \u201cIn short, the more positive tone than in March is consistent with officials tightening again as soon as the June meeting, but only if the data and markets are supportive,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said after the announcement. \u201cWe expect they will be supportive.\u201d When the FOMC met in March, two of its 10 members wanted to raise rates in the near future. Yet only one of them \u2013 Esther George, Kansas City Fed president \u2013 voted to increase the interest rates target range to 0.5% to 0.75% in March. On Wednesday, George once again cast the lone vote in favor of increasing interest rates. Over the past couple of months, nonvoting members of the Fed including Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart, Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker and San Francisco Fed president John Williams have expressed support in hiking interest rates soon. Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, also expressed hope that the Fed will increase interest rates when it meets in June. \u201cThe Fed has the markets on Ritalin\u201d \u2013 medication used to tread attention-deficit, hyperactivity disorder \u2013 \u201ctrying to keep the mood very smooth, keep volatility down as much as possible. As soon as they hint that they might remove that, then they create the problems that they\u2019re afraid of,\u201d he told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cThey have boxed themselves into a corner.\u201d It will be interesting to see how they maneuver out of that box, he said. \u201cThe sooner they act, the better.\u201d Prior to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, more than 80 economists polled by Reuters said that they were expecting two rate increases this year, with the first hike coming as early as June. Not everyone is so sure that the Fed will manage to find a window for two rate hikes before the end of the year. \u201cUnless there\u2019s a robust pick up in the data for May, Fed policymakers are likely to be looking at some gloomy economic trends at the June meeting, making a rate hike hard to justify,\u201d explained Markit\u2019s Williamson. \u201cThe Fed may also not want to unsettle markets with a rate hike just days before the UK\u2019s 23 June referendum on remaining in the EU.\u201d Williamson pointed out that if US GDP picks up in the second quarter, it won\u2019t be confirmed until after the FOMC meets in June. That could delay interest rate hike until September, which could be too close to the 8 November presidential election. \u201cThat would then leave December as the next opportunity to raise interest rates, when the political and economic environments could look very different to now,\u201d he said. \u201cBarring a substantial and convincing improvement in the economic data flow between now and June, it looks like December could be the most likely next opportunity to hike rates.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Before the forfeiture committee is summoned to consider de-gonging Sir Philip Green, it\u2019s probably wise to introduce some proper process into the unpicking of the BHS fiasco. Frank Field\u2019s work and pensions select committee can do valuable work on the narrow question of assessing the impact on the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the lifeboat for defined-benefit schemes. It can also invite Green to give evidence \u2013 and, by the way, it should also call Lady Green, since she was the formal owner of the department store chain. And the Pensions Regulator can assess whether the Greens should be asked to contribute more to the pension scheme. But what is really needed is an old-style Department of Trade and Industry investigation, which may even be wider than the inquiry Sir Vince Cable called for last night. Were the trustees of the BHS pension fund asleep when Green\u2019s family was extracting dividends? Did those famous names on the BHS board \u2013 Allan Leighton, now chairman of the Co-op Group, and bankers Robin Saunders and Chris Coles \u2013 assess long-term risks to the pension fund? Did property transactions between BHS and the Green family weaken the pension fund\u2019s covenant? How did the trustees and Green decide in 2012 that 23 years would be a suitable period in which to attempt to close a deficit that now stands at \u00a3571m? Should the Pensions Regulator, in future, approve the sale of any business with a deficit in its pension fund? And, after the sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions, were the \u201cprofessional fees\u201d charged by the owners justified? Proper process these days means the administrator to BHS filing a report on the collapse, which will cover the conduct of current and former directors. The insolvency service then reads it and can make recommendations for further inquiry to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Sajid Javid, the secretary of state, can then order whatever investigation he wishes. Javid should opt for the fullest possible inquiry, assuming there are grounds to do so. In the last big collapse in the retail industry \u2013 Comet in 2012 \u2013 taxpayers were left with a bill to cover redundancy payments. Yet the insolvency service\u2019s report was never published, despite then-business secretary Cable\u2019s promise to share details. At BHS it is possible the PPF will have to increase levies on other defined-benefit funds. This time, let\u2019s have the full facts on the table. If Green\u2019s knighthood is to be removed, let everybody see why. Barclays\u2019 new chief needs to get tough on bonuses Jes Staley\u2019s pitch at Barclays is that, once he has shed the dross, the rest of the bank will finally sparkle for long-suffering shareholders. The new chief executive puts it less excitedly, of course. \u201cThe performance of the core today shows the potential power of the group once it is freed from the drag of non-core,\u201d he said. Up to a point, that\u2019s a reasonable analysis, and one Barclays was keen to emphasise. The bank boasted about its 18% increase in \u201ccore\u201d pre-tax profits in the first quarter before mentioning the all-in 25% decline to \u00a3793m. Fair enough. But don\u2019t run away with the impression that the core is entirely healthy. The plan to sell the African assets was not the biggest decision Staley has made since arriving last autumn. Rather, it was retention of the investment bank, which has earned its keep only about one year in every four since the financial crisis. This year is already shaping up as yet another non-vintage offering. Underlying profits declined by almost a third in the corporate and investment bank as revenues fell. Many competitors are doing worse, but an incoming Barclays chief executive should know his duty when return on equity in investment banking is still sub-par \u2013 cut those bonuses. The efforts of his predecessor, Antony Jenkins, were limp and he will forever be remembered for his confession that he could not be tougher for fear of a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d, a remark that encapsulated how Barclays\u2019 high-earners have a stranglehold over the shareholders. Staley has already added to investors\u2019 suffering by pre-announcing a 50% dividend cut. That setback demands a stiffer response on 2016 bonuses than Wednesday\u2019s vague promise to adjust \u201cappropriately\u201d. Maybe Staley\u2019s end-of-year action will be stronger than his words \u2013 it had better be. Amazon\u2019s man at the DWP makes a discreet exit How convenient. Doug Gurr, the Amazon executive whose appointment as a non-executive director at the Department for Work and Pensions caused a storm in February, has got a promotion. He has been switched from Amazon\u2019s Chinese operations to leading the UK end. You might think a UK posting would make it easier to rock up at the DWP occasionally, but Amazon says he needs to \u201cfocus on his new role\u201d and thus his government job has ended almost before it began. Take a bow Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who questioned the sense of putting an Amazon exective at the heart of government when so many web-based multinationals\u2019 tax affairs are under the spotlight.

Which? claimed that supermarkets were pushing illusory savings and fooling shoppers into choosing products that they might not have bought if they knew the full facts. \u201cThe CMA\u2019s examination of the market, following the supercomplaint, found that supermarkets generally take compliance seriously, but there were some promotional practices that could mislead shoppers,\u201d said Michael Grenfell, the CMA\u2019s executive director of enforcement. \u201cWe welcome the commitment we have received from Asda as well as the engagement from other supermarkets, and expect them all to ensure that their practices are not misleading and that shoppers are better informed and able to choose the products that most suit their needs.\u201d The Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: \u201cFollowing our supercomplaint last year, we are pleased to see the CMA investigation has resulted in Asda taking action to stop misleading special offers. Asda has been found breaking the rules and now must immediately clean up their act. \u201cOur supercomplaint and actions taken by the authorities should serve as a clear warning to all retailers. If they try to pull the wool over consumers\u2019 eyes, they will not get away with it. Retailers must get their house in order.\u201d Alex Chisholm, the CMA\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis draws the CMA\u2019s follow-up work to the supercomplaint to an end. In addition to our work with Asda and the other retailers, we are pleased to see that our recommendations concerning the key legislation and guidance in this area are being taken forward. \u201cThe Chartered Institute of Trading Standards is currently working on a revision to the pricing practices guide and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has indicated that it intends to consult, following our recommendation that it review the legislation and guidance on unit pricing.\u201d The CMA said Asda had already started making changes to the operation of its was/now and multibuy promotions. These should be fully implemented by August 2016 and the CMA will check how they are working six months later. Asda\u2019s chief executive, Andy Clarke, said: \u201cWe are consistently recognised as the UK\u2019s lowest price, full-range supermarket, offering prices that are at least 10% less than those of our rivals. Asda has won the Grocer 33, the most credible pricing measure in our industry, for the last 18 years and we\u2019re pleased that the CMA has today recognised that we take pricing compliance seriously.\u201d Clarke said all supermarkets had been asked to review their pricing practices and make any necessary changes, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s important that customers know that the CMA did not make any findings against Asda and it hasn\u2019t questioned our commitment to everyday low prices.\u201d The struggling retailer recently confirmed plans to cut up to 500 jobs in stores and 250 at its head office in Leeds, as it tries to protect profits while sales slide amid competition from the discounters. In February, Asda revealed its worst quarterly sales fall, with sales down by 5.8% at established stores in the 13 weeks to 1 January. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of declining sales for Asda and marked it out as the worst performer of all the big grocers over the Christmas period. The CMA has not ruled on whether supermarkets\u2019 pricing and promotional practices have breached consumer law, however, saying this is a matter for the courts.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest care home group, Four Seasons Health Care, has reported a \u00a3264m annual loss, highlighting the crisis in the social care industry amid rising costs and falling fees from local authorities. The company\u2019s chairman, Robbie Barr, insisted that it was improving the quality of its care and was pressing ahead with a turnaround plan, despite the loss and Four Seasons\u2019 debts of more than \u00a3500m. Four Seasons, which cares for 18,500 elderly people and has 31,000 staff, has fallen deep into the red after writing down the value of the care homes it owns by \u00a3224m, roughly a third of their value. This followed an independent valuation of Four Seasons\u2019 estate and reflect the industry as a whole, according to the company. The care home operator owns roughly 55% of its 440 sites, with the rest rented from a landlord. Barr said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty challenging year for the industry as a whole.\u201d Care homes are being squeezed by a decline in the fees that cash-strapped local authorities pay towards residents\u2019 care and a rise in staff costs caused by the introduction of the \u00a37.20 an hour \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which came into force on 1 April. Four Seasons said councils needed to raise their payments by 5% in order to cover the increase in staffing costs. It claimed that there had been a real terms fall of 5% in fees over the past five years. The chancellor, George Osborne, has allowed councils to increase council tax by an extra 2% a year to help fund social care, and more than 90% of local authorities have introduced the levy by the maximum amount allowed. However, these funds are yet to flow through to care homes. Barr said: \u201cWe are now running at 87.5% occupancy, which is in line with historic levels and pretty close to where the sector is. But the bigger issue is the funding from local authorities; there is a deficit to where the cost of care is.\u201d Four Seasons has been at the forefront of the crisis facing the industry, not only because it is Britain\u2019s biggest care home group, but because of its debts, on which it paid interest of \u00a352.1m last year. Credit rating agency S&amp;P has warned that Four Seasons will run out of cash in 2016 unless it undergoes a radical financial restructuring. The performance of the care home provider has prompted criticism of the role of private equity in social care. The company is owned by Terra Firma, Guy Hands\u2019 private equity firm. However, Ben Taberner, the chief financial officer of Four Seasons, insisted that the company would not run out of cash. \u201cI spent alot of time explaining to them [S&amp;P] that [what they said] wasn\u2019t correct,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have run out of cash by now if it was correct. This group has medium-term flexibility in its finances.\u201d Barr maintained that the quality of care at Four Seasons, which also owns Brighterkind and Huntercombe care homes, had not suffered as a result of the financial pressure. The number of Four Seasons homes that have been blocked by the Care Quality Commission from taking on new residents has fallen to three from 28 two years ago. \u201cThe strategy we have put in place for the business is working,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThere has been a significant increase in the quality of care in the business. There are really encouraging signs that the focus on care is filtering through to other metrics [such as financial].\u201d Elli Investments, the owner of Four Seasons, reported sales of \u00a3688m for 2015, down from \u00a3713m the previous year. The group made a pre-tax loss of \u00a3264m, compared with a \u00a370.1m loss in 2014 and a profit of \u00a352.3m in 2013. Excluding the impairment charge on its property, Four Seasons reported underlying profits of \u00a338.7m, down by 40% on the previous year. Barr declined to say how many homes could close this year as a result of the financial outlook, saying it will depend on the company\u2019s performance as 2016 progresses. \u201cIt really is wait and see, it\u2019s moving quickly in the sector,\u201d he said. Four Seasons sold off 18 homes last year. But Barr admitted that the company was looking to restructure its finances. \u201cWe announced last October the appointment of financial and legal advisers to consult on improving the group\u2019s financial position,\u201d he said. \u201cFollowing their work over the last six months, [Four Seasons] has started to engage with certain key stakeholders, or their advisers, to explore a long-term solution for the debt and capital structure of the group, which we hope to resolve during the course of 2016. \u201cWhatever the outcome, the group continues to have medium-term finances for its needs and we don\u2019t envisage this process having any effect on the day-to-day care provision in our homes, hospitals and specialist care centres.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Another rise in the oil price helped lift stock markets, even though crude came off its best levels following a bigger than expected rise in US inventories. UK GDP was in line with forecasts, while there was a positive reaction to a number of company results including Barclays and GlaxoSmithKline. Apple\u2019s disappointing figures however left technology shares flagging, and investors remained cautious ahead of the latest rate setting meetings from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 35.39 points or 0.56% at 6319.91 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.39% to 10,299.83 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.58% to 4559.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.43% to 18,750.62 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.53% higher at 9332.6 In Greece, the Athens market fell 2.51% to 584.55 on renewed concerns about its bailout and new disagreements with its creditors On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 22 points or 0.13% ahead of the Fed. Meanwhile Brent crude is currently up 1.16% at $46.27 a barrel having earlier climbed as high as $47.05. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Citi has come up with forecasts for interest rates in the UK, eurozone and Japan: Here\u2019s Reuters latest story on the situation between Greece and its creditors: Greece accused the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday of undermining negotiations over the release of more bailout funds needed in the next few weeks to repay debt. At issue is what measures Athens would take if it fails to reach fiscal targets by 2018. Creditors, including the IMF and European institutions, want those measures made law immediately. Athens argues that its constitution precludes legislation on a hypothetical event but it has offered to discuss a mechanism of automatic cutbacks. Government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili told reporters that the IMF had not accepted the proposal. \u201cThe IMF is making demands which go beyond what was agreed,\u201d Gerovasili said, referring to a 86-billion-euro ($97-billion) deal struck last year and talks to unlock more than five billion euros in bailout funds needed to pay EU and IMF debts by July. \u201cThese demands undermine efforts by both the Greek government and European institutions,\u201d she said. An IMF spokesman in Washington said the institution had no immediate comment on the matter. More on Greece: The interview closes with Draghi saying it will be his pleasure to go to the Bundestag. On the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union, Draghi says: I cannot and do not wish to believe that the British would vote to leave, because we are stronger together. But if they do, it should be clear: they would lose the benefits of the single market. Draghi was also asked about Greece: BILD: Mr Draghi, in your first interview with BILD four years ago, we spoke a lot about Greece. The country has still not got back on its feet, even though it has received hundreds of billions in emergency loans. When will the madness end? Draghi: Clearly, last year was an economic setback for Greece. Now everyone is aware that there can be no growth without reforms. And what the country and its citizen need above all is growth. Greece has implemented many reforms in the past months and is committed to the path of reforms. BILD: Is the euro a part of the solution for Greece, or a part of the problem? Draghi: Greece\u2019s challenges have little to do with the euro. It would have to implement reforms in any case. In the Eurozone, Greece can do that with the support of its partners. But one thing must be clear: who belongs in the euro area and who does not is not for the ECB to decide. That is a matter for the Member States. BILD: They are now more fractious than ever. Is that the biggest danger for Europe? Draghi: We are experiencing several crises which are all interconnected and reinforce each other. That makes it all the more important to resist every kind of nationalism or isolationism. Both are however on the rise. That worries me a lot. Ahead of a visit to the German parliament, ECB president Mario Draghi has given an interview to Bild newspaper. Draghi has been criticised in Germany for the ECB\u2019s low interest rate policy, which has affected the country\u2019s savers, and has also been attacked by German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. In the interview - which has been repeated in English by Business Insider - he has come out fighting\u201d Draghi: We are well aware of the situation for savers. And it\u2019s not only in Germany that people have to face low interest rates. But interest rates are low because growth is low and inflation is too low. Think about the alternative: if we raised rates now, it would be bad for the economy and we would unleash deflation, unemployment and recession. The interest on savings comes from growth, so the interest of savers is that inflation stabilises and growth becomes more robust. Besides, many savers benefit from low interest rates as they are also homebuyers, taxpayers, entrepreneurs and workers whose companies are benefiting. BILD: In Germany the adverse effects are predominant. Making provision for retirement is becoming increasingly difficult\u2026 Draghi: Remember, what counts is what you earn on savings in real terms, i.e. interest minus inflation. This is higher today than it was in the 1990s. At that time you might have had a higher interest rate on your Sparbuch, but we often had an inflation rate that was higher still. So you could buy less with the money you received. Moreover, people can influence how much they get on their savings even in times of low interest rates. They don\u2019t just have to keep the money in savings accounts but can invest in other ways. The Bundesbank has recently shown that the average return on all German household assets is close to 2%. BILD: So, are the German savers themselves to blame? Draghi: No. But there are alternatives in investing savings. In the United States savers had to face seven years of zero interest rates. Banks, insurers, the financial system nevertheless still worked. Money was invested in a variety of ways which in the end enabled a decent return. He also said he did not take the criticism from the likes of Sch\u00e4uble personally but added: One thing is clear: the ECB obeys the law, not the politicians. Or, as one of my predecessors put it, it is normal for politicians to comment on our actions. But it would be abnormal if we listened to them. And he defended the ECB policies, saying they were working: But we must be patient; investor confidence has not yet been fully restored. For two years, the economy in the euro area has been growing month by month, banks are lending and unemployment is steadily falling,. Meanwhile, euro area countries are now able to buy more German exports again, which, for German companies, is partly making up for the decline in trade with China. But it is a slow process because the crisis was more severe than anything we had since the Second World War. As to when interest rates would rise, he said: Quite simple: when the economy is growing more strongly again and inflation rises closer to our objective. Low interest rates today will lead to higher rates tomorrow. And he said the majority of governments were acting on the necessary reforms \u201calbeit too slowly for my personal taste. All of them would be well advised to do more. But that is not primarily dependent on the ECB and its policies.\u201d The US Treasury secretary undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, has been speaking to a House financial committee, and made some comments on the situation in Greece. Reuters reports: [He] said that Greece would not have access to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s exceptional lending facilities in the next phase of its bailout, adding that the Treasury supports the IMF\u2019s insistence that the bailout be restructured to make Greece\u2019s debt sustainable with more reforms from Athens and debt relief from European lenders. David Morrison, senior market strategist at SpreadCo said: The latest crude inventories from the EIA showed a build of 2 million barrels last week... Crude fell sharply on the news. Yesterday the American Petroleum Institute reported a draw of nearly 1.1 million barrels in US inventories last week. Oil soared on the news as analysts had expected a build of 2.4 million barrels. Both WTI and Brent are trading at their best levels since November last year. The trigger for the latest leg of this rally was talk of an output freeze by OPEC and non-OPEC producers. But all hopes for a deal collapsed ten days ago in Doha amid general recriminations. Nevertheless, crude has continued to push higher as analysts predict that supply and demand will come into balance earlier than previously calculated. But it may become more difficult for crude to push on much higher from here. As $50 per barrel becomes a possibility, we should see mothballed US shale production come back on line. On top of that producers will sell forward contracts to lock in prices. US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, up by 2m barrels to 540.6m barrels. Analysts had expected an increase of around 1.75m barrels, and the US Energy Information Administration said: \u201cUS crude oil inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year.\u201d The rise in crude stocks - a sign of slowing demand - has seen the oil price come off its best levels. Brent, which was up 2% before the data - is now 0.85% higher at $46.13. More data for the US Federal Reserve to contemplate as they meet to discuss their latest views on interest rates and the economy. Home sales rose by more than expected in March, according to the National Association of Realtors. Its pending home sales index climbed 1.4% month on month to 110.5, the highest level since last May and better than the 0.5% increase expected. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said: Despite supply deficiencies in plenty of areas, contract activity was fairly strong in a majority of markets in March. This spring\u2019s surprisingly low mortgage rates are easing some of the affordability pressures potential buyers are experiencing and are taking away some of the sting from home prices that are still rising too fast and above wage growth. The association added: In the short-term, the healthy labor market and favorable borrowing costs should lead to sustained buyer demand and a durable pace of sales. However, Yun says the consequences from a failure to construct more single-family homes in recent years are starting to impact some top job producing markets, where endless supply shortages continue to limit choices for buyers and are driving up prices beyond what a growing share of households can comfortably afford. \u201cDemand is starting to weaken in some areas, particularly in the West, where the median home price has risen an astonishing 38 percent in the past three years,\u201d adds Yun. \u201cAs a result, pending sales in the region have now declined in four of the last five months and are lower than one year ago for the third month in a row. Closed sales in the region in March were also below last year\u2019s pace.\u201d Apple is currently the biggest faller in the Dow Jones Industrial Average: Despite European markets holding onto to their - slight - gains, Wall Street is slipping lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 20 points or 0.11% while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.22% at the open and Nasdaq 0.66%. Apple has dropped nearly 8% after it reported its first quarterly revenue fall for 13 years, Twitter is down more, falling 15.7% following its figures. And here (in Greek) is the call from Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for a European summit. Here\u2019s the statement from European Council president Donald Tusk: Buckle up, folks, the Greek debt crisis is roaring back over the horizon. Relations between Athens and its lenders have hit their worst level since last summer, when the 3rd Greek bailout deal was finally agreed. The two side simply can\u2019t reach a deal over the various \u2018emergency measures\u2019 that would kick in if (or perhaps when) it misses the economic targets in its bailout. This is now causing a cash crunch in Greece, forcing the government to tap various state bodies for spare funds. And there\u2019s serious chatter that we could be looking at fresh elections, or even another referendum, soon. So what\u2019s happened today? So far.... Greece\u2019s prime minister has proposed a meeting of EU leaders to discuss the crisis, but with little success. European Council president Donald Tusk has argued that finance ministers need to make more progress, and hold a eurogroup meeting very soon. Greece is refusing to accept extra austerity and blaming its creditors, as Reuters explains: Greece accused the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday of undermining efforts to broker an accord over its funding options, after talks on a review to unlock fresh bailout aid stalled. Athens would be willing to discuss the introduction of a mechanism to automatically cut spending, Government Spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said. Greece could not go beyond that, she said. One of Greece\u2019s familiar allies, Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, has offered prime minister Alexis Tsipras some support. He agrees that it\u2019s wrong to push Athens to sign up to further cuts, on top of the measure already agreed. Financial traders are concerned, dumping Greek bonds and thus driving the yield on Greek debt higher into the danger zone: The Greek stock market was hit too: Technical talks are still continuing between officials in Greece, in the hope of a breakthrough. But anyone who lived through last year\u2019s drama will understand that progress could be limited.... Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s UK slowdown: There are some interesting developments around BHS today. First up, Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman reports that the stricken high street retailer received a demand for \u00a32.6m in unpaid VAT last week, shortly before it fell into administration. Another \u00a310m was due by 30 June, to cover the sale of its Oxford Street store, perhaps explaining the timing of its collapse. And more surprisingly, BHS\u2019s most recent owner is apparently planning to buy the company back! Former racing driver Dominic Chappell, whose reputation has been rather savaged in recent days, has told the Evening Standard that he is meeting potential backers in America right now. He\u2019s hoping to come back with a \u201creal deal\u201d to save as many jobs as possible. Good news? Probably not, given Chappell\u2019s failure to keep the company on the road. A BHS spokesman has already said the idea is \u201cpure fantasy\u201d. Care to guess the fastest growing area of the UK economy in the last 25 years? Royal Bank of Scotland have crunched the numbers, and report that management consulting and head office activities have swelled by 500% since 1990* *- A vintage year, including the Italian World Cup, the end of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s premiership, and the Stone Roses playing Spike Island. But while consultancy has been booming, manufacturing and mining has been steadily declining, they show: There\u2019s little cheer in the City today about the latest UK growth figures. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has dropped by 12 points today to 6272 points, with supermarket chain Tesco shedding 4%. Mining shares, a handy bellwether for global economic confidence, are down around 2% too. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says traders are nervous ahead of tonight\u2019s meeting of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, and may sound cautious about growth prospects [we get US GDP data tomorrow] It\u2019s politically convenient for George Osborne to blame June\u2019s EU referendum for weakness in the UK economy. But economists are warning that the problems run deeper. Scott Corfe of the Centre for Economics and Business Research says Osborne\u2019s growth forecasts are simply too optimistic. Here\u2019s why: Firstly, the consumer economy is coming off the boil. Retail sales volumes have fallen for two consecutive months on the latest ONS data. Rising inflation later this year and into 2017 will take further steam out of the household-led recovery, as will signs of a softening in the labour market with some high profile companies announcing job cuts in recent weeks. The UK\u00b4s international trade position is also a major concern. The current account data released last month showed a record high deficit of 7% of GDP at the end of last year - now greater than the fiscal deficit. Essentially, the country\u2019s poor position on exports and overseas investments means that the UK is now borrowing a huge sum of money from the rest of the world each year. Unless financial markets respond to this and sterling sharply depreciates it is hard to see this being resolved anytime soon. The introduction of the National Living Wage will also lead to job losses, he adds, while efforts to rein in the buy-to-let market may also harm consumer confidence, Corfe continues. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, agrees that Osborne must take the blame: \u201cBrexit anxiety could certainly be behind some of the slowdown in GDP growth, but the truth is the recovery remains lacklustre. Growth has failed to return to the pre-crisis trend on a sustained basis, and the government\u2019s excessively tight fiscal policy is largely at fault. \u201cOn top of that, wage growth is anaemic and the labour market appears to be slowing down, meaning the macro outlook is as uncertain as it has been for years. More gloom: In another worrying sign, UK retail sales have fallen at the fastest rate in four years. The CBI reports that the recent cold weather hurt demand for clothes, footwear and leather good this month. Sales also fell at department stores; bad news for the high street as it reels from the collapse of BHS and Austin Reed this week. 22% of retailers interviewed by the CBI said that sales volumes were up in April compared to a year ago, whilst 36% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of -13%. That\u2019s the weakest since January 2012. CBI director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith, said: \u201cCold weather put a chill in sales of spring and summer ranges with a reported dip in retail sales in the year to April. But with the near-term outlook for household spending holding up the sector expects a modest rise in sales next month. OECD chief \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda is now warning reporters in London that the is \u201cno economic upside\u201d for the UK outside the EU. It\u2019s \u201cdelusional\u201d to claim that Brexit would give Britain a stronger trading position, Gurr\u00eda adds, warning that some firms would quit the UK. And in an alarming development, the 65-year old Gurr\u00eda has revealed his full commitment to togetherness.... The OECD has now joined the chorus of international bodies arguing against Brexit, claiming it will hit us in the pocket. My colleague Larry Elliott reports: The west\u2019s leading economics thinktank has warned that a British decision to leave the EU in this summer\u2019s referendum would cost each household \u00a32,200 by the end of a decade and continue to impose \u201ca persistent and rising shock\u201d on the UK in the following years. Adding its voice to negative assessments by the Treasury and the International Monetary Fund, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said a so-called Brexit vote on 23 June would provide a major negative shock to Britain and have ripple effects on the rest of Europe. \u201cIn some respects, Brexit would be akin to a tax on GDP, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy that would not be incurred if the UK remained in the EU,\u201d the OECD said. Full story: Britain\u2019s economy has hit a \u2018soft patch\u2019, warns John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC. He blames: ...heightened uncertainties about the global economy at the start of the year, which hit the export-oriented manufacturing sector and also took the wind out of the sails of the key business and financial services sector, where growth slowed from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2015 to just 0.3% in the first quarter of 2016. Brexit uncertainty isn\u2019t helping. \u201cUncertainty about the EU referendum outcome may also have had an impact from late February onwards as it became clear there would be an early vote in June. This may have led to some delay in major investment decisions, as indicated by weak construction output in the first quarter. Hawksworth hopes, though, that growth will rebound later in the year: Today\u2019s report shows that growth in the business services and finance slowed to +0.3%, from +0.7% in the last quarter of 2013. This is the main reason that total Services growth slowed from 0.8% to 0.6%, the ONS says. That backs up the theory that stock market turbulence hurt growth. It may also indicate nervousness about the EU referendum, though, as many City firms oppose Brexit. In the production sector, mining and quarrying output shrank by 2.2%, while manufacturing decreasing by 0.4% And Britain\u2019s total economy is now 7.3% higher than before the financial crisis - making it the third best-performing G7 economy. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, questions whether Brexit is really to blame: The effects of global financial market volatility, stuttering world trade growth and challenges on the high street feel like more obvious explanations for the slowdown. Still, referendum wobbles could make themselves felt in the coming months, highlighting the continuing downside risks for the economy this year\u201d Here\u2019s Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s official response to the news that Britain\u2019s economy is slowing.... \u201cIt\u2019s good news that Britain continues to grow, but there are warnings today that the threat of leaving the EU is weighing on our economy. \u201cInvestments \u200eand building are being delayed, and another group of international experts, the OECD, confirms British families would be worse off if we leave the EU. \u201cLet\u2019s not put the strong economy we\u2019re building at risk, and vote to Remain on June 23.\u201d Reminder: the OECD report is due out at 10.30 BST, but the group has already called Brexit a \u2018bad decision\u2019 this morning. James Knightley of ING Bank fears that growth is continuing to weaken in the run-up to June\u2019s referendum. He says: We suspect that second-quarter GDP growth will be even weaker given the threat of Brexit is negatively impacting business sentiment, leading to a reduction in risks appetite regarding hiring and investment decisions. Indeed, unemployment actually rose in the three months to February while consumer confidence is also coming under pressure. City economist Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank, reckons we can\u2019t blame Brexit fears for the economic slowdown, yet.... Instead, he argues that the financial market turbulence at the start of 2016 hurt confidence. That is not to say that Brexit uncertainty won\u2019t have an impact on GDP growth \u2013 it will. However, this is likely to be visible via reduced investment and hiring and will show up in Q2 GDP. The first estimate of that will come out in late-July \u2013 a month after the actual vote. For now, 0.4% q/q isn\u2019t terrible \u2013 it could have been worse As predicted, the chancellor has claimed that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU membership is hurting the economy: ONS chief economist Joe Grice says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures suggest growth has slowed as compared with the pace up to the middle of last year. Services continue to underpin the economy but other sectors have shown falling output this quarter. That\u2019s a blow to hopes of rebalancing the UK economy, as manufacturing, construction and agriculture are still smaller than before the financial crisis. Britain\u2019s service sector was the only part of the economy to grow in the last quarter! Manufacturing, building and farming all contracted, leaving the UK even more reliant on the already dominant service sector. Here\u2019s the details: Services output rose by 0.6%, (corrected) industrial production shank by 0.4% Construction contracted by 0.9% Agriculture by 0.1%. Breaking: UK economic growth has slowed to 0.4% in the first three months of this year. That\u2019s a sharp slowdown, compared to the 0.6% recorded between October and December last year. More to follow.... CNBC also predicts that Brexit fears are weighing on UK growth: The UK economy is expected to post a sharp slowdown in growth in the first quarter amid concerns that a forthcoming vote on the country\u2019s membership of the European Union is scaring investors and industry. Market analysts believe that preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) estimates released on Wednesday morning will show a slowdown in the first quarter to 0.4 percent, down from 0.6 percent in the previous quarter. Some analysts, such as those from Barclays and Pantheon Macroeconomics, thought the slowdown could be more pronounced, however, to 0.3%. The anticipated slowdown has been attributed by all analysts to the \u201cincreasing EU referendum risk,\u201d as Barclays\u2019 analysts said in a note on Wednesday, and fears of a so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d should U.K. voters elect to leave the EU when a referendum is held on June 23. Shares in Barclays have jumped almost 4% to the top of the London stock market leaderboard. Although Barclays posted a 33% drop in pre-tax profits this morning, traders are encouraged that the bank has received approaches for its African business (former CEO Bob Diamond is interested, for starters) Here\u2019s what City economists are saying about this morning\u2019s growth figures, due in an hour\u2019s time. Howard Archer of IHS Global insight, predicts EU referendum fears will knock back growth to 0.3% for the first quarter (down from 0.6%) \u201cIn particular, this is expected to weigh down on business investment and employment, and it may well also limit consumers\u2019 willingness to splash out on big-ticket items. Muted global growth and recent financial market volatility will also hamper UK economic activity in the near term at least.\u201d Tony Cross of Trustnet believes City investors will take the news calmly: We\u2019ve got UK GDP data later this morning and with the Brexit effect having been seen in other Q1 metrics, this is likely to reflect badly on the headline figures but the market may well be willing to overlook any wobbles here, given the evolving sentiment. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has become the latest international body to warn Britain against leaving the EU. They are publishing a new Brexit report this morning, but OECD chief \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda has broken his own embargo and spilled the beans on the Today Programme. Gurr\u00eda declared that \u201cBrexit is a tax\u201d, effectively costing us all one month\u2019s salary by the end of the decade. In the end we come out saying \u201cWhy are we spending so much time, so much effort, so much talent, trying to find ways to compensate for a bad decision that you don\u2019t have to take. Gurr\u00eda added that Britain won\u2019t get a better deal on trade or migration if it leaves the EU - a claim Out campaigns would obviously dispute. We\u2019ll have more details at 10.30am BST. After the embargo lifts, \u00c1ngel..... If today\u2019s growth figures are bad, you can expect George Osborne to blame Brexit fears. The chancellor has already been warning that economic confidence has been hurt by the upcoming EU referendum (his party\u2019s bright idea, let\u2019s not forget). Sky News\u2019s Faisal Islam predicts that Osborne will stick to this message: Chancellor George Osborne is set to repeat his argument that the EU referendum is already weighing down the UK economy. The key measure of economic growth - the GDP figure for the first three months of this year - will be released later today. It is expected to be markedly down from the last quarter of 2015. A slowdown from the 0.6% growth registered in Q4 in 2015 has been anticipated by both the Bank of England and independent economists. GDP growth is expected to have slipped to 0.4% in Q1 of 2016..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re about to get a fresh healthcheck on the UK economy, and the results may not be too pretty. Britain\u2019s growth is expected to have slowed pretty sharply in the last three months, from 0.6% to 0.4%, or possibly even worse. Weakness in the global economy is partly to blame, such as the slowdown in China\u2019s economy. The turmoil that gripped the stock markets in January and early February may also have had an impact on confidence, spending and investment. Domestic issues are another factor; how much damage has the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU referendum caused? We find out at 9.30am BST. Also coming up today: Stock markets are expected to fall back this morning, with the FTSE 100 called down 18 points. Tech stocks may be under pressure, after Apple posted its first drop in sales since 2003 - sending its shares down 8% in after-hours trading. It\u2019s a big day for UK corporate results, including Barclays bank, shopping chain Home Retail Group, and estate agent Foxtons. And the eurozone debt crisis is bubbling up again. Overnight, there are reports that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is seeking an emergency summit to discuss his bailout deal after talks between creditors over reform measures floundered. And with Spanish voters heading back to the polls in June, we could be facing another summer of European drama....",

When will the madness end?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> Clearly, last year was an economic setback for Greece. Now everyone is aware that there can be no growth without reforms. And what the country and its citizen need above all is growth. Greece has implemented many reforms in the past months and is committed to the path of reforms.</p> <p><strong>BILD: Is the euro a part of the solution for Greece, or a part of the problem?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> Greece\u2019s challenges have little to do with the euro. It would have to implement reforms in any case. In the Eurozone, Greece can do that with the support of its partners. But one thing must be clear: who belongs in the euro area and who does not is not for the ECB to decide. That is a matter for the Member States.</p> <p><strong>BILD: They are now more fractious than ever. Is that the biggest danger for Europe?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> We are experiencing several crises which are all interconnected and reinforce each other. That makes it all the more important to resist every kind of nationalism or isolationism. Both are however on the rise.

And it\u2019s not only in Germany that people have to face low interest rates. But interest rates are low because growth is low and inflation is too low. Think about the alternative: if we raised rates now, it would be bad for the economy and we would unleash deflation, unemployment and recession. The interest on savings comes from growth, so the interest of savers is that inflation stabilises and growth becomes more robust. Besides, many savers benefit from low interest rates as they are also homebuyers, taxpayers, entrepreneurs and workers whose companies are benefiting.</p> <p><strong>BILD: In Germany the adverse effects are predominant. Making provision for retirement is becoming increasingly difficult\u2026</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> Remember, what counts is what you earn on savings in real terms, i.e. interest minus inflation. This is higher today than it was in the 1990s. At that time you might have had a higher interest rate on your Sparbuch, but we often had an inflation rate that was higher still. So you could buy less with the money you received. Moreover, people can influence how much they get on their savings even in times of low interest rates. They don\u2019t just have to keep the money in savings accounts but can invest in other ways. The Bundesbank has recently shown that the average return on all German household assets is close to 2%.</p> <p><strong>BILD: So, are the German savers themselves to blame?</strong></p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> No. But there are alternatives in investing savings. In the United States savers had to face seven years of zero interest rates. Banks, insurers, the financial system nevertheless still worked. Money was invested in a variety of ways which in the end enabled a decent return.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said he did not take the criticism from the likes of Sch\u00e4uble personally but added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing is clear: the ECB obeys the law, not the politicians. Or, as one of my predecessors put it, it is normal for politicians to comment on our actions. But it would be abnormal if we listened to them.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he defended the ECB policies, saying they were working:</p> <blockquote> <p>But we must be patient; investor confidence has not yet been fully restored. For two years, the economy in the euro area has been growing month by month, banks are lending and unemployment is steadily falling,. Meanwhile, euro area countries are now able to buy more German exports again, which, for German companies, is partly making up for the decline in trade with China. But it is a slow process because the crisis was more severe than anything we had since the Second World War.</p> </blockquote> <p>As to when interest rates would rise, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Quite simple: when the economy is growing more strongly again and inflation rises closer to our objective. Low interest rates today will lead to higher rates tomorrow.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he said the majority of governments were acting on the necessary reforms \u201calbeit too slowly for my personal taste. All of them would be well advised to do more. But that is not primarily dependent on the ECB and its policies.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-27T15:39:18.324Z\">at 4.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5720d77de4b09a82af1484ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-27T15:17:51.367Z\">4.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The US Treasury secretary undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, has been speaking to a House financial committee, and made some comments on the situation in Greece</strong>.

Here\u2019s why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Firstly, the consumer economy is coming off the boil</strong>. Retail sales volumes have fallen for two consecutive months on the latest ONS data. Rising inflation later this year and into 2017 will take further steam out of the household-led recovery, as will signs of a softening in the labour market with some high profile companies announcing job cuts in recent weeks.</p> <p><strong>The UK\u00b4s international trade position is also a major concern.</strong> The current account data released last month showed a record high deficit of 7% of GDP at the end of last year - now greater than the fiscal deficit. Essentially, the country\u2019s poor position on exports and overseas investments means that the UK is now borrowing a huge sum of money from the rest of the world each year.

      "bodyText": "Amazon has brought in Doug Gurr, the boss of its Chinese business, to run its UK operations in a move that could signal an acceleration of the online firm\u2019s plans to sell groceries in Britain. Gurr was development director at Asda for nearly five years before joining Amazon in 2011. His return to the UK comes weeks after Amazon revealed a deal to sell fresh, chilled and frozen food made by Morrisons, the Bradford-based supermarket chain. Last September Amazon also began selling frozen items via its Prime Now one-hour delivery service, which is offered in big cities including London and Manchester. That followed the expansion of the Amazon Pantry service, which enables shoppers to fill a box of grocery items from a range of 4,000 household products, including big brands such as Kellogg\u2019s, Ariel, Colgate and Kronenbourg. Fresh and frozen food is not available. Gurr replaces Chris North, who will quit the company in May to join the US online photo gift retailer Shutterfly. Under North, Amazon has achieved strong growth in the UK, confirming its position as one of the company\u2019s most important markets. However, his tenure has also been fraught with controversy over Amazon\u2019s tax arrangements, handling of weapons and employment practices. Gurr has also attracted controversy after he was appointed as a non-executive director at the Department for Work and Pensions in January. The Labour MP and tax campaigner Margaret Hodge described his appointment as \u201cdisgusting\u201d, given Amazon was among the companies embroiled in a row over taxes. There have been concerns that US-based technology giants such as Amazon are having an increasing influence on government, even during growing public pressure for them to pay more tax in the UK. Gurr stepped down from his role at the DWP on Wednesday in order to \u201cfocus on his new role,\u201d according to Amazon. Xavier Garambois, the vice-president of EU Retail at Amazon, said: \u201cDoug has a deep knowledge of Amazon\u2019s business and is ideally placed to provide both continuity and progression in the UK as we continue to focus on providing our customers with ever better selection, value and convenience.\u201d When Gurr joined Amazon he led its UK hardlines division, which includes products such as lawn and garden equipment and toys. But Gurr has extensive experience of running online food business. At Asda, where he spent about four and a half years, he was responsible for strategy, logistics and online operations helping the supermarket strengthen its dotcom business. Before that he was chief executive of Blueheath Holdings, an online grocery wholesaler he founded and led to its listing on London\u2019s AIM market. The group later merged with cash and carry group Booker.",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers stayed away from Britain\u2019s high streets in April as cold weather dampened demand for summery clothes, prompting the sharpest decrease in sales in more than four years. The poor weather and intense competition for customers dented sales, according to the CBI, defying expectations of a resurgence. Consumers bought fewer clothes, shoes and household goods compared with the same month last year. Department store sales were also weaker. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s director of economics, said: \u201cCold weather put a chill in sales of spring and summer ranges with a reported dip in retail sales in the year to April, but with the near-term outlook for household spending holding up the sector expects a modest rise in sales next month. \u201cHowever, with margins remaining tight within the sector, retailers will continue to operate in a fiercely competitive environment for some time.\u201d Of the 117 companies surveyed by the business lobby group, just 22% reported a rise in sales compared with last April, while 36% said sales were lower. The resulting balance of -13% was the weakest since January 2012, and compared with 7% in March, according to the CBI\u2019s distributive trends survey. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the timing of Easter \u2013 which fell earlier this year than last \u2013 was probably partly to blame for the sharp drop in sales. Sales would have been bolstered in April 2015 by the holidays, he said. Tombs added: \u201cConsumers, however, clearly have tightened their purse strings this year. This slowdown is likely to continue, given the intensification of the fiscal squeeze in April and the recent stagnation of employment.\u201d The weak survey echoed the wider economy, with Britain\u2019s recovery slowing in the first three months of the year. Growth in GDP was 0.4% in the first quarter, down from 0.6% in the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics said. Retailers surveyed by the CBI said they expected sales to be stronger in May, with a balance of 9%, although this was well below the long-term average of 24%. The survey is the latest indication of the struggle retailers are facing on Britain\u2019s high streets. BHS and Austin Reed have both called in administrators this week after running out of money, putting thousands of jobs at risk. In the latest available official figures, the ONS said retail sales volumes fell 1.3% in March, a much sharper drop than the 0.1% dip forecast by economists. The main drag on volumes came from food and clothing, as fashion sales were hit by unsettled weather and the early Easter did little for grocers.",

This slowdown is likely to continue, given the intensification of the fiscal squeeze in April and the recent stagnation of employment.\u201d</p> <p>The weak survey echoed the wider economy, with Britain\u2019s recovery slowing in the first three months of the year. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/27/uk-gdp-growth-slows-to-04-amid-eu-referendum-uncertainty\">Growth in GDP was 0.4% in the first quarter, down from 0.6% in the previous three months,</a> the Office for National Statistics said.</p> <p>Retailers surveyed by the CBI said they expected sales to be stronger in May, with a balance of 9%, although this was well below the long-term average of 24%.</p> <p>The survey is the latest indication of the struggle retailers are facing on Britain\u2019s high streets. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/26/bhs-owner-dominic-chappell-moved-funds-out-of-troubled-retailer\">BHS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/26/upmarket-tailor-austin-reed-to-go-into-administration\">Austin Reed</a> have both called in administrators this week after running out of money, putting thousands of jobs at risk.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/21/uk-retail-sales-drop-shoppers-cut-back-food-clothes-ons\">In the latest available official figures, the ONS said retail sales volumes fell 1.3% in March</a>, a much sharper drop than the 0.1% dip forecast by economists.</p> <p>The main drag on volumes came from food and clothing, as fashion sales were hit by unsettled weather and the early Easter did little for grocers. <br></p> <p><strong> <br></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "The bookmaker Gala Coral has agreed with the gambling regulator to pay out nearly \u00a3880,000 after taking hundreds of thousands of pounds from a \u201cVIP\u201d problem gambler who was using the proceeds of theft to feed his habit. The Gambling Commission said Gala Coral had failed in its duty to prevent money laundering and problem gambling, adding that its safeguards against both were inadequate. It said the bookmaker had failed to make sufficient inquiries into the source of the wealth of one of its VIP customers, who gambled away nearly \u00a3850,000 of stolen cash in its shops and online. This was due to \u201csystemic faults\u201d in the company\u2019s approach to problem gambling and money laundering, the commission said. The regulator added that Gala Coral acknowledged the \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d at an early stage and proposed the settlement, pre-empting the need for a review of its gambling licence. Gala Coral initially flagged up the fact that the customer\u2019s spending was higher than his likely income internally, deeming him a \u201dred\u201d customer of potential concern. But the bookmaker relied on \u201cuncorroborated\u201d suggestions that the man was independently wealthy, when in fact he had stolen \u00a3800,000 from a vulnerable person. The commission said staff based their belief in the man\u2019s wealth on explanations given by family and friends at two hospitality events organised by the bookmaker. The company \u201cdid not challenge these assertions, nor did it seek any further corroboration\u201d, the commission said. \u201cGala Coral Group failed to conduct adequate inquires about the source of funds the customer used to gamble in store and online, and placed over-reliance on the fact that the relevant payments were all made through one UK clearing bank account,\u201d it added. Gala Coral was also criticised for failing to spot signs that the man, an electrician, was a gambling addict. \u201cThere were indicators in the customer\u2019s online and in-store play which could have been used to identify him as problem gambler,\u201d the commission said. The gambler, who was a customer of Gala Coral between 2012 and 2015, was jailed for three years over the theft. The bookmaker will pay \u00a3846,664 to the victim of the theft and his family, as well as making a \u00a330,000 payment to \u201creflect the cost\u201d of the commission\u2019s investigation. The money paid to the victim\u2019s family equates to less than a day\u2019s worth of Gala Coral\u2019s takings last year. The bookmaker also promised to take steps to improve its anti-money laundering and social responsibility processes. The settlement is part of a continuing effort by the commission to crack down on bookmakers that turn a blind eye to money laundering and problem gambling. Earlier this year, Paddy Power was forced to pay out \u00a3280,000 after the commission found that it had encouraged a problem gambler to keep betting until he lost five jobs, his home and access to his children. The commission is understood to be taking a tougher line under its new chief executive, Sarah Harrison. On Wednesday, it warned gambling firms to learn the lessons from the Paddy Power and Gala Coral settlements. \u201cThe gambling industry should be on notice that the issues identified in this statement are likely to form the basis for future commission compliance activity,\u201d a statement said. Richard Watson, a programme director at the commission, said: \u201cWe expect the industry will learn the lessons from this case, as it is their responsibility to keep crime out of gambling and protect vulnerable people from harm.\u201d \u201cWe know that Gala Coral have reflected heavily on this case and have assured us of actions they have taken to address the failings. Operators must proactively monitor customers to keep gambling safe and free from crime.\u201d Gala Coral said it had stopped doing business with the man before it was aware of any police investigation, adding that failures in its controls had \u201cfor the most part\u201d already been addressed last year. The bookmaker said it had beefed up its anti-money laundering team, improved training and introduced new tools to tighten up customer checks. \u201cDue to the unique circumstances of this case and the impact upon the family of the amount stolen by the customer, we have agreed with the family to make an ex gratia payment to them equal to the customer\u2019s losses of \u00a3846,664,\u201d the company said. But campaigners for further measures to combat problem gambling said the settlement was evidence that Gala Coral had not learned from previous failings. \u201cWe were told three years ago by the Gambling Commission that Coral have learned their lesson after a customer laundered nearly \u00a31m through their fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs),\u201d said Matt Zarb-Cousin, a reformed gambling addict and spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling. \u201cIt is not surprising to hear of another case when nothing has changed since then. The regulator appears to be doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. \u201cIf Coral are serious about preventing money laundering, why are they lobbying against their inclusion in the EU\u2019s fourth money laundering directive, which would merely require players staking more than \u00a31,500 to identify themselves? \u201cBookmakers have become a target for criminals as roulette is offered on FOBTs at \u00a3100 a spin, which is the perfect game for money laundering, as it can be played with minimal risk.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays has revealed it has received approaches for its African operations \u2013 which its former chief executive Bob Diamond wants to buy \u2013 as it reported a 25% slump in first-quarter profits and losses on oil-related loans. The bank, currently undergoing a restructuring under its new chief executive, Jes Staley, reported first-quarter profits of \u00a3793m and a 15% rise in bad debts, largely a result of problems facing clients in the oil and gas sector. Staley, an American banker who took the helm in December after a hiatus in the boardroom, also warned Barclays\u2019 investment bankers that their bonuses would be cut because of a slowdown in the industry. Staley said there had been expressions of interest in the African business, which was put on the market last month. \u201cOn Africa, we continue to explore opportunities to reduce our shareholding to a level that achieves regulatory deconsolidation, including capital market and strategic options, and we are pleased with the level of indicative interest in what is a high quality business,\u201d said Staley. He did not name the potential buyers for Barclays Africa, a complex business that is listed on the Johannesburg stock market and in which Barclays has a 62.5% stake. However, Diamond, who was chief executive of Barclays before being forced after the Libor rigging scandal, said on Tuesday that he had the funding to table a potential offer. Staley does not necessarily want to sell the entire stake in Barclays Africa, but lower it to below 20% as part of a plan to preserve capital, which has already led him to cut the dividend for this year and next. He has said it could take up to two years to dispose of the African stake but the possibility of a faster than expected disposal sparked questions from analysts about whether the dividend cut could be rethought. A year ago the bank\u2019s profits were knocked by \u00a31bn of charges in anticipation of fines for rigging foreign exchange markets and more payouts for payment protection insurance. This quarter the charge for such misconduct was \u00a378m. Staley has created two major divisions at Barclays, a UK arm and a corporate and international division, in anticipation of the ringfencing rules that come into force in 2019 and require separation of risky investment banking operations from UK high street customers. The bank had already warned that trading in its investment banking arm \u2013 once the powerhouse of the business \u2013 was slowing and profits in this division were down 31%, although this was not as bad as feared by the market. Staley said that though the investment banking arm had performed well compared with its US peers he was keeping a close watch on costs. \u201cWe will adjust bonuses for 2016 appropriately, given that our year over year revenues were down, and mindful of the fact that the industry more widely has made dramatic cuts to performance accruals in the first quarter,\u201d he added. Profits in the UK arm fell 2% amid fierce competition in the mortgage market. There is also a non-core division that includes parts of the investment bank as well as its Egypt and Zimbabwe banks and its continental retail bank. On Wednesday, it announced talks to sell its 74-branch network in France to AcaCap Financial Partners. The bank\u2019s chairman, John McFarlane, has previously expressed a preference for the UK to remain part of the EU and, as it published its first-quarter figures, the bank warned that it was \u201ccautious as we approach the 23 June EU referendum\u201d. McFarlane will chair the bank\u2019s annual general meeting on Thursday, where he will face questions about the cut to the dividend despite his pledge to bolster payouts to shareholders. \u201cThe dividend cut is painful,\u201d said Staley, who said major institutional investors were supportive of the decision while the non-core divisions was being sold off. Everyone wants the restructuring of Barclay to come to an end in a reasonable period of time,\u201d said Staley. \u201cThe performance of the core [part of the bank] today shows the potential power of the group once it is freed from the drag of non-core.\u201d",

The bigger question is when - perhaps if - the central bank will ever get borrowing costs back to more normal levels. December brought the first US rate rise in almost a decade but since then Fed policymakers, led by chair Janet Yellen, have been sitting on their hands. The Fed\u2019s main interest rate is still very close to zero, with a range of 0.25-0.5%. If you find waiting for the next rise like watching paint dry, fear not. Merle Hazard, Nashville\u2019s most financially literate music star, has come to the rescue and summed up the frustrations of Fed watchers and savers alike with his latest bluegrass ditty: How Long (Will Interest Rates Stay Low)? Merle \u2013 also known as Nashville-based money manager Jon Shayne \u2013 shot to internet fame during the credit crunch with musical parodies such as Bailout and In the Hamptons, a parody of the Elvis Presley hit In the Ghetto about the fate of a mortgage bond trader. This latest release from the man in beige features Grammy-award winning banjoist Alison Brown, who was a contemporary of Shayne\u2019s at Harvard and gave up investment banking for a music career. Here\u2019s a flavour of the song, which is sure to resonate with pensioners and German finance ministers frustrated with low eurozone interest rates. How long will interest rates stay low? That\u2019s the question, the whole world wants to know How long will borrowing be free? How long will we be subsidised by savers and retirees? But there are also words of support for central bankers like the ECB chief, Mario Draghi, who has been rebuffing German suggestions that rock-bottom rates are the root, not the symptom, of economic woes. As Hazard sings: Some say low rates are symptomatic, rather than the cure I have a hunch they\u2019re right. I can\u2019t say I am sure. But recovery has been long and slow, the crisis wounds are deep So until we see inflation, money\u2019s likely to be cheap Hazard, whose name is based on that of the recently departed country singer Merle Haggard, has also released H-E-D-G-E, a parody of the Tammy Wynette hit D-I-V-O-R-C-E and the Greek Debt Song.

      "bodyText": "Profits at Argos slumped by more than a third in the past year as shoppers bought fewer TVs, iPods and cameras and the chain was forced to cut prices in a highly competitive market. The business, which is being bought by supermarket group Sainsbury\u2019s for \u00a31.4bn, revealed a near-36% dive in profits to \u00a383.1m in the year to 27 February. Total sales for the chain remained steady at \u00a34.09bn as revenues at established stores slid 2.6%. John Walden, the chief executive of Argos\u2019s parent Home Retail Group, said he did not believe trading at Argos had been affected by uncertainty around the takeover but was the result of a difficult market for electrical goods, which make up more than half of the chain\u2019s sales. Sales of TVs fell 6% and sales of large kitchen appliances were also down while profit margins for Argos slid 0.5 percentage points as the company had to cut prices Walden said: \u201cThe market is not robust at the moment. It is fairly lacklustre. It could be the EU referendum, it could be a continuation of the challenges we saw towards the back of last year with high street footfall and the move online. I think there are a number of factors at play. Retail is being challenged.\u201d He said Argos was fortunate to have lined up the deal with Sainsbury\u2019s, which offered the opportunity to expand into concessions within the supermarket\u2019s stores. As more people buy clothes and goods for their homes online, supermarkets are one of the few retailers where shoppers continue to visit regularly to buy their groceries. However, Walden said he believed Argos\u2019s problems were more likely to be the result of cyclical difficulties in the electrical goods market rather than a trend for people to buy less. As many major retailers struggle to entice shoppers on to the high street, some executives at leading companies have suggested shoppers\u2019 habits have changed for good. Ikea\u2019s head of sustainability told a Guardian conference in January that consumption of many familiar goods was at its limit and consumers had hit \u201cpeak stuff ... peak home furnishings\u201d. Last month, Next boss Simon Wolfson wiped billions off the value of some of the UK\u2019s biggest retail groups after he said he expected to see a \u201cconsumer slowdown\u201d this year. Walden expressed disappointment with the sales performance at Argos but said Home Retail Group had produced slightly better than expected profits after it cut costs at Homebase, the DIY chain which it sold to Australian Group Wesfarmers this year. Underlying pretax profits for the group slid 28% to \u00a394.7m as sales slipped 1% to \u00a35.7bn. However, the group slumped to a \u00a3804m loss as it was forced to write down the value of the goodwill relating to Argos by \u00a3852m. Walden said the writedown related to the value of Argos under the Sainsbury\u2019s deal compared with the goodwill booked for the company when it was bought by Home Retail\u2019s former parent GUS in 1998. He said the writedown was an accounting matter and \u201cnot troublesome in any way\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s takeover of Argos is expected to be completed in the autumn. Walden said it was too early to say if he would be staying on after the deal was completed and did not expect to find out if competition authorities would examine the deal until the summer.",

      "bodyText": "The estate agent Foxtons is braced for weaker sales in the coming months as buyers become jittery in the face of mounting uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future in Europe. The London-focused agent said the possibility of Brexit in the run-up to the EU referendum in June was expected to weigh on its first-half results. Nic Budden, Foxtons\u2019 chief executive, said: \u201cWe expect the first half of the year to be challenging with a reduced sales pipeline entering into the second quarter and the underlying short-term impact on transaction volumes from the uncertainty around the European referendum.\u201d Foxtons reported a strong first quarter with sales boosted as investors rushed to buy properties before the government imposed a new stamp duty surcharge on second homes. The company, known for its fleet of minis and cafe-style offices, reported a 16.2% increase in revenue to \u00a338.4m in the first quarter to 31 March. The revenue rise was mainly driven by a 28.5% increase in property sales commissions as investors went ahead with their purchases before the new surcharge was introduced on 1 April. Under the new rules, anyone buying a property for more than \u00a340,000 to let or use as a holiday home will pay stamp duty on the purchase at a rate three percentage points higher than the standard rate. \u201cWe have had a strong start to the year with a record first quarter driven by a number of sales transactions being brought forward before the introduction of the additional stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let properties,\u201d Budden said. However, because completions were brought forward to beat the stamp duty deadline, Foxtons said the sales pipeline for the second quarter was lower than it was a year ago. Lettings revenue was flat in the first three months of the year, as tenants renewed existing contracts and entered into longer tenancy periods. Revenue at Alexander Hall, Foxtons\u2019 mortgage broker, increased 57.6% over the period. Budden said the company was pressing ahead with expansion plans, as it increases market share in parts of outer London. Foxtons opened four new branches during the quarter, in Loughton, New Malden, Sutton and Fulham, taking its total to 62. It plans to open three more branches in 2016, all outside central London\u2019s zone 1. Earlier this month Foxtons awarded Budden a pay rise of at least 19% after he stepped into the breach when his predecessor resigned for personal reasons. Budden\u2019s basic wage for this year will be \u00a3550,000, up from \u00a3461,250 in 2015, while his maximum bonus will rise from 125% of salary to a maximum of 150%. Including bonuses and share incentive payments, Budden\u2019s total pay packet could hit \u00a32.3m for this year compared with the \u00a3856,000 he received last year.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy slowed sharply in the first three months of 2016 as factors unrelated to the looming in/out EU referendum put a brake on growth. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was no evidence for or against a \u201cBrexit effect\u201d on gross domestic product (GDP) as it reported that output had expanded by 0.4% in the first quarter \u2013 down from 0.6% in the final three months of 2015. The government\u2019s decision to hold a referendum was not taken until late February, and business groups cited the impact of weaker global trade and the new year turbulence in the financial markets as more likely explanations for the softness in growth. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, was reluctant to blame speculation about Brexit for the slowdown. \u201cThe effects of global financial market volatility, stuttering world trade growth and challenges on the high street feel like more obvious explanations for the slowdown. Still, referendum wobbles could make themselves felt in the coming months, highlighting the continuing downside risks for the economy this year.\u201d However the chancellor, George Osborne, said uncertainty caused by the referendum had been a factor. \u201cIt\u2019s good news that Britain continues to grow, but there are warnings today that the threat of leaving the EU is weighing on our economy. \u201cInvestments \u200eand building are being delayed, and another group of international experts, the OECD, confirms British families would be worse off if we leave the EU. Let\u2019s not put the strong economy we\u2019re building at risk, and vote to remain on 23 June.\u201d Solid growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of GDP, compensated for falls in output in the other three parts of the economy: production, construction and agriculture. The ONS said services had expanded by 0.6% in the first quarter, adding 0.5 percentage points to growth. Construction fell by 0.9%, production by 0.4% and agriculture by 0.1%. Between them, the three declining sectors subtracted 0.1 points from quarterly growth, leaving the year-on-year rate of growth unchanged at 2.1%. After its performance in the first quarter, the economy is almost 8% bigger than before it dropped into recession in early 2008. However, growth has been entirely dependent on the service sector, with output in both construction and manufacturing still below the levels of eight years ago. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cFalls in manufacturing and construction are a serious concern, keeping growth at a three-year low. For all the rhetoric of fixing the roof, it is the foundations of the economy that are being left to crumble.\u201d Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures suggest growth has slowed as compared with the pace up to the middle of last year. Services continue to underpin the economy but other sectors have shown falling output this quarter.\u201d A further easing of growth is being anticipated for the second quarter, a period that will include the referendum on 23 June. The Bank of England has already warned that activity could be affected as the date of the poll gets nearer, with firms likely to put investment decisions on hold until the outcome is known. Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said: \u201cUncertainty about the economic outlook appears to have intensified ahead of the EU referendum, and the danger is that this will cause a lull in businesses decision making as the June vote draws closer, which will in turn reduce business spending, investment and hiring in the second quarter.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A disappointing trading update has put the brakes on rail and bus group Stagecoach. The company\u2019s shares have dropped 8.4p or 3% to 259.6p after it said the outlook for the UK rail industry was more challenging than this time last year: Although growth trends continue to vary across the different parts of the rail industry, overall industry rate of revenue growth has slowed in recent months... We believe the reduced rate of growth reflects the effects of weakening consumer confidence, increased terrorism concerns, sustained lower fuel prices, the related effects of car and air competition, slower UK GDP growth and slowing growth in real earnings. We have taken and will take further steps to mitigate the effects of lower revenue growth, focusing on cost control and additional initiatives to grow revenue. We continue to work constructively with the Department of Transport and other industry partners to meet our obligations, manage contract changes and ensure the continued stability and growth of our rail business. Like for like revenue growth in its rail division - mainly South West trains and East Midlands trains - was 2.5% in the last 48 weeks. Growth at its mainline joint ventures was higher, with Virgin Trains East Coast up 4.9% and West Coast 4.6% better. UK bus growth was just 0.2%, its London bus business was up 1.1% and its North American division fell by 3.4%. It said it was on track to meet full year earnings expectations. In a sell note, analysts at Liberum said: Divisional revenue growth rates appear to have slowed slightly, except in North America where there has been a slight improvement. Management\u2019s commentary on the outlook in UK Rail appears downbeat, citing slower revenue growth in recent months. April 2016 forecasts [are] probably not changing materially, but possible downside risk to 2017. Jefferies analyst Joe Spooner said: Stagecoach says that it is \u201con course\u201d to achieve its 2016 adjusted earnings per share expectation. But understanding how the slowdown in UK Rail and the group\u2019s view of a more challenging sector outlook now feeds into East Coast\u2019s prospects is a key issue raised. Additionally, we continue to see ongoing slow growth in UK bus as a source of continuing margin pressure for the group\u2019s core unit. He added: The outlook for UK rail industry is seen as \u201cmore challenging\u201d than a year ago and trends have slowed (like for like growth at 2.5% over 48wks versus 4.6% at 40 weeks in the directly operated franchises mathematically suggests around down 8% over the last 8). At West Coast, revenues appear to be down over 5% over the last 5 weeks. We expect focus will be on understanding the implication of all this on East Coast specifically. As a new franchise on which Stagecoach took a 90% interest that was bid on the assumption of compounding growth, this is likely to be a key focus for discussion.",

But understanding how the slowdown in UK Rail and the group\u2019s view of a more challenging sector outlook now feeds into East Coast\u2019s prospects is a key issue raised.

At West Coast, revenues appear to be down over 5% over the last 5 weeks. We expect focus will be on understanding the implication of all this on East Coast specifically. As a new franchise on which Stagecoach took a 90% interest that was bid on the assumption of compounding growth, this is likely to be a key focus for discussion.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "After Apple\u2019s disappointing sales figures overnight, a number of iPhone suppliers have felt some of the backlash. Arm, a weak market of late is an exception, recovering from an early fall to 915p to add 7.5p to 935p. But Imagination Technologies is down 5p or 3% at 157.75p and Laird is 4.4p or 1.2% lower at 354p. After 13 years of revenue growth the US technology group reported a 13% decline in quarterly sales, with the iPhone suffering its worst ever quarterly drop in sales. It also warned it expected sales in the next quarter to be lower than the forecast $47bn, sending its shares 6% lower in after hours trading. Liberum analysts said: Amongst the UK suppliers, Imagination is most exposed ( around 50% of revenue from Apple), followed by Laird (17%) and Arm (above 10%) We already forecast a 25% year on year decline in Imagination\u2019s graphics royalties in the second half of 2016 (ended April 2016) and believe new management set guidance conservatively when numbers were reduced. We also believe investors should focus on Imagination\u2019s design wins with MediaTek and Spreadtrum which ramp in 2017 and should be very material to revenue (hundreds of millions of incremental royalty units versus Imagination\u2019s graphics royalties of 458m at present). On the call Apple also said they were increasingly looking at M&amp;A and we believe Imagination could be a target once again in time. Regarding Laird we believe the expected rebound in the second half may now be at risk and investors could start to focus on Laird\u2019s leverage - 2.3 times net debt/EBITDA which is high for a business with consumer electronics exposure. Regarding ARM, Apple\u2019s results show that the smartphone market is slowing rapidly and around 65% of ARM\u2019s royalty revenue comes from smartphones. Given Arm reports in arrears it also sees the weakness a quarter after its customers. [We] would sell Arm, be increasingly cautious on Laird and use weakness to buy Imagination ahead MediaTek and Spreadtrum ramps. Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 4.01 points to 6280.51 ahead of UK GDP and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision later on Wednesday (no change is expected but analysts will be looking for clues as to when a rate rise may happen.) Barclays is up 2.8p at 176.75p following its figures, while Worldpay is leading the risers, up 5.8p to 264.1p after UBS moved from neutral to buy. The bank said: When we initiated on Worldpay, we highlighted our positive view on the business opportunities, but that we struggled with the valuation. Since it published 2015 full year results, Worldpay has fallen by 12% while its US peers have risen 12%, leaving Worldpay trading in-line with peers, and we believe the risk/reward (+41% upside versus -26% downside) is sufficiently attractive and upgrade to buy from neutral. We believe that Worldpay\u2019s significant exposure to online transactions and investments in new value-added services will help the company to outgrow its peers. We believe the business can deliver around 9% net revenue growth compound annual growth rate and around 17% earnings per share compound annual growth rate (2016 to 2020). Back with the market generally, and Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: We\u2019re seeing a slightly softer start to the day\u2019s trade in London although there\u2019s certainly no shortage of earnings news needing to be digested by the market. Barclays is [higher] despite a drop in profits for the quarter, with lower impairment charges and conformation that the company is still on course to meet full year guidance evidently offering investors something to cheer here. Informa is another big gainer on the day, supported off the back of a broker upgrade, while it\u2019s the commodity stocks that are once again languishing. The miners are seeing weakness continue from lacklustre overnight trade in Australia, whilst Standard Chartered is on the back foot once again with yesterday\u2019s bumper gains being chipped away at \u2013 the detail showed even the chief executive was cautious about calling the recovery too soon, so there\u2019s still the potential to see further declines in the days and weeks ahead. Standard Chartered is down 21.2p at 550.2p, while BHP Billiton has fallen 12.8p at 914p. Elsewhere Home Retail Group, the Argos owner in the process of being taken over by Sainsbury, has dipped 0.9p to 169.3p after it reported a 28% fall in full year profits to \u00a394.7m. But analysts at RBC said: Home Retail has reported slightly better than expected full year results with pretax profits of \u00a394.7m, 2% ahead of consensus at \u00a393m. By division, Argos EBIT of \u00a383.1m was around 5% ahead of consensus expectations owing to better opex while Homebase EBIT of \u00a323.5m missed consensus expectations of \u00a328m. The year-end cash balance was \u00a3623m while the underlying financing net cash position, excluding the impact of the Homebase transaction, was broadly flat year on year at around \u00a3309m.",

      "bodyText": "Britain has fallen behind other European countries in efforts to get more women on to company boards, with research showing women occupy less than a quarter of all UK board positions. With women in 23.2% of board seats last year, Britain falls short of the European average of 25%. That compares with 38.7% in Norway, which has a 40% mandatory target and still tops the table, according to research by European Women on Boards (EWoB), a network which includes Britain\u2019s Institute of Directors. The UK has fallen to ninth place in the network\u2019s ranking of 12 leading European economies, down from eighth place in 2011, despite having nearly doubled female board representation from 12.2% five years ago when the coalition government adopted a 25% target. At least a third of UK boardroom positions should be held by women by the end of the decade, a government-backed report from Lord Mervyn Davies said last year, stopping short of recommending enforced quotas. The only countries behind Britain are Germany (22.6%), Spain (18.8%) and Switzerland, where women make up 16% of boardroom directors. The introduction of mandatory quotas in Italy, Belgium, France and Germany have led to quick boosts in numbers. The report, which examined the boards of the 600 largest listed European companies between 2011 and 2015, found that the percentage of women on boards also almost doubled across Europe, from 14% to 25%. In the most dramatic change, Italy achieved 24.6% female board represention last year from only 4.2% in 2011 \u2013 the lowest number in Europe then \u2013 while Belgium nearly tripled its proportion to 27% from 10%. Europe\u2019s largest economies also made big improvements, to 34.4% from 18.2% for France, and 22.6% from 13.2% for Germany. Norway was the only country which recorded a fall in the proportion of women on boards, from 40.2% to 38.7%. Because the 40% quota does not apply to employee representatives, the actual overall percentage of women on Norwegian boards may fall below 40%. On a more comprehensive measure of female participation at the top of companies Britain has fallen since 2011 from sixth place to eighth. This ranking takes into account therepresentation of women on audit and remuneration committees and the proportion of women as board chair, chief executive and of newly elected directors. Lady Barbara Judge, who chairs the Institute of Directors and is a member of the EWoB advisory board, said: \u201cBritish firms will have to reach the government\u2019s ambition for a third of board posts to be held by women by 2020 if we are to have a chance of climbing toward the top of the European table.\u201d She said a particular worry was slow progress in appointing more women to executive positions. Only 3% of the chief executives of Europe\u2019s 600 largest companies are women \u2013 a figure that has barely moved since 2011. She called on boards to consider changing their appointment procedures, for example by making sure a woman is on the interview panel, improving mentoring and demanding more of headhunters. In some areas, the UK\u2019s performance has been stronger, with female directors in the UK more likely than the European average to serve on the important nomination, remuneration and audit committees. The research also commends UK firms for the quality of their reporting on board appointments. Across Europe, the proportion of all-male boards has fallen to 5.4% from 21% in 2011. The report argues legislation has not been the only factor behind increased female appointments. Although Norway has a board gender quota, Sweden and Finland, where more than 30% of director roles are held by women, do not. On the network\u2019s wider ranking, Sweden came top, followed by Norway, Belgium, Finland and France.",

She called on boards to consider changing their appointment procedures, for example by making sure a woman is on the interview panel, improving mentoring and demanding more of headhunters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7683dea401bc3a5519bce098d7ef4669fa1caa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7683dea401bc3a5519bce098d7ef4669fa1caa5/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Female board member addressing staff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The proportion of all-male boards across Europe has fallen to 5.4% from 21% in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In some areas, the UK\u2019s performance has been stronger, with female directors in the UK more likely than the European average to serve on the important nomination, remuneration and audit committees.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s inflation rate saw its biggest fall for seven years in the year to the March quarter, official figures have shown, making fresh interest rates more likely. Falling petrol costs pushed the consumer price index 0.2% lower in the quarter to 1.3%, figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed. It had been expected to rise 1.3%. It was the first quarterly fall since the final three months of 2008 when the global financial crisis was at its height. Annual underlying inflation, which strips out volatile price movements, was the weakest since records began in 1983, growing just 1.55%. The Australian dollar dropped by more than 1.5% to US76.29c as expectations rose that the Reserve Bank would once again cut borrowing costs. The local stock market climbed on the back of figures, however, as investors warmed to the idea of cheaper money. The ASX/S&amp;P200 benchmark of leading shares was up 0.85% to 5,264 points at 12.30pm, before falling back to 5,232 by 2.30pm. The inflation rate of 1.3% is well below the RBA\u2019s target range of 2-3%, which increases the chances of an interest rate cut. Lower inflation will give more scope for the RBA to cut without risking more inflation in return if it decides the economy needs more stimulus. Savanth Sebastian, an economist at CommSec, said: \u201cIt is pretty clear that inflation is not a threat to the domestic economy, meaning that the Reserve Bank can comfortably keep interest rates at exceptionally low levels over the medium term. \u201cDomestic inflationary pressures remain well contained and given the slow growth in wages it is unlikely to result in a change to the domestic inflation landscape.\u201d The sluggish rise in prices has been helped by the impact of lower oil prices on the cost of petrol, which dropped 10% compared with the previous quarter and is now selling for under $1 a litre at some garages. The price of fruit was also singled out for mention by the ABS after it fell 11.1% while international holiday travel and accommodation fell 2%. The falls were offset by higher secondary school fees ( up 4.6%), medical and hospital services (1.6%) and pharmaceutical products (4.8%). In a sign that house prices are slowing, the housing component of the index rose just 1.7% over the the year to March \u2013 the lowest annual increase since December 1998.",
