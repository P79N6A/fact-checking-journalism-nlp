Pizza Express branches are to be targeted by protesters from Monday, as part of an attempt to get the restaurant chain to stop creaming off a proportion of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards. Campaigners have also started an online petition in the hope that restaurant-goers will back their demands. In a policy that has outraged some employees, Pizza Express keeps, as an admin fee, 8p out of every \u00a31 paid when tips are given by card. The chain, which has 430 branches around the UK and is particularly popular with families, makes an estimated \u00a31m a year from the practice, according to the union Unite. \u201cWe believe this 8% fee is unfair and that, if the chain values its staff, it should be paying them the total tips they are given by customers,\u201d said Chantal Chegrinec, campaigns officer at Unite. \u201cWe are starting with Pizza Express but they are by no means the only offender and we will be turning our attention to other companies after this.\u201d The protests are being organised by local branches of Unite and the first will take place at the British Museum branch of Pizza Express in London on Monday evening. The union has also written to the restaurant chain\u2019s CEO, Richard Hodgson. Unite began the campaign following a survey of its Pizza Express members after the chain was sold to a Chinese private equity firm, Hony Capital, last year. One of the top issues was the 8% deduction from their tips. One disgruntled Pizza Express employee, who wants to remain anonymous, said that the admin fee was costing her \u00a33 a night. \u201cI have worked at Pizza Express for 15 years,\u201d she said in a letter to Unite. \u201cAfter all this time I\u2019m still only paid the national minimum wage of \u00a36.50 an hour. So you see my colleagues and I are heavily reliant on customer tips to top up our low wages. I work hard and am good at my job, but when Pizza Express thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card, I get upset.\u201d Pizza Express joins restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi in siphoning off 8% of the tips paid by card, but other chains deduct even more. Caf\u00e9 Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%, as do Strada and Giraffe, which is owned by Tesco. A spokesperson for Pizza Express said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of running a \u201ctronc\u201d \u2013 a standard pay arrangement used to distribute tips among staff. \u201cWe went to great lengths to set up this tronc system which is chaired by a troncmaster and run by a committee of waiters and pizzaiolos, who independently decide how tips made by electronic card payment are subsequently distributed between front and back of house restaurant team; a system run by employees for the employees,\u201d she said. The chain, which sells 29m pizzas a year through its UK restaurants, denied that it profits from the admin fee. But other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from tips. Wagamama, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday all take nothing. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, Chiquitos and Garfunkels, used to charge 10% but dropped this policy several years ago. Last week Unite targeted 10 Pizza Express restaurants in south London, distributing leaflets to customers who were \u201cshocked and disgusted\u201d by the practice.

    "webTitle": "It\u2019s the \u00a364bn question: what does George Osborne have left to sell off?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s decision to begin selling down the government stake in Royal Bank of Scotland has paved the way, many feel, for a glut of government asset sales that prompts comparisons with the Thatcher era. Critics complained that the RBS share sale crystallised a \u00a31.1bn loss on the government\u2019s stake, which it has held since its rescue of the bank following the financial meltdown. But for the chancellor, it represents the first phase of a series of sell-offs that will raise \u00a332bn this year and a further \u00a332bn by the end of this parliament in 2019-20, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. Other assets to be sold off include shares in Lloyds Banking Group (also bailed out in 2008) and Royal Mail, more RBS shares, assets relating to the student loan book and mortgages taken out with failed institutions Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley. If Osborne succeeds, he will raise more from the sale of state assets in a single year than even Lady Thatcher did in 1987 \u2013 when her government sold \u00a321bn worth of shares in British Airways, the British Airports Authority, British Petroleum, Rolls-Royce and the Royal Ordnance Factories. Osborne is boastful about the scale of his sell-off programme, saying in his budget speech that it will \u201cdeliver the largest privatisation proceeds of all time, higher than the previous record in 1987\u201d. But there are very real differences between the two eras. Thatcher\u2019s selling spree was predominantly of equity stakes in previously nationalised industries. Osborne\u2019s is split pretty evenly between a sell-down of equity in part-owned companies and the disposal of mortgage assets. There is also less of a push towards popular capitalism this time. The sales of shares in Lloyds and RBS have been aimed solely at institutional investors. And an attempt to entice retail investors to buy shares in Royal Mail ended in controversy when those ordering above \u00a310,000 worth received nothing. Rather, Osborne\u2019s motivation appears to be to pull out of areas in which he believes the state should not be involved, and to raise cash to cut the national debt. With those aims in mind, the chancellor has a long potential auction list. Committed for sale Royal Bank of Scotland Expected proceeds: \u00a323.2bn The government expects to reduce its 73% stake to 25% during the lifetime of the parliament. Now the first tranche of shares has been sold, Osborne is hoping the attractiveness of RBS as an investment will increase, even though many analysts in the City have, in the short term at least, been bearish about the bank\u2019s shares. Those who are more bullish about RBS\u2019s valuation argue that with 79% of the shares previously held by the government, the stock was pretty illiquid and therefore unattractive to hold. As more shares trade on the public markets, the hope is that index funds \u2013 which track particular stock market indices \u2013 will have to hold it, and this will increase its attractiveness. The Office for Budget Responsibility assumes that selling down the RBS stake will raise \u00a35.8bn a year for four years, to take the government\u2019s holding down to 25% by the end of the parliament. Bankers think the sheer volume of shares to be sold makes the task a tricky one. But Osborne has already shown he does not mind selling the bank\u2019s stock off at a bargain price. Lloyds Bank Expected proceeds: \u00a313bn In June, Osborne announced that he wanted to \u201creturn Lloyds to the private sector over the coming year\u201d. On that basis, the OBR expects the government to sell around \u00a313bn of shares in the bank in 2015-16, some of which will be sold directly to retail investors. Shares in Lloyds are likely to remain attractive to investors, barring major regulatory mishaps: the banking group resumed paying dividends to investors this year. Royal Mail Expected proceeds: \u00a31.5bn Bankers describe the sale of the government\u2019s remaining 15% of Royal Mail as a straightforward task. For this financial year, the OBR is including proceeds of around \u00a31.5bn from this and the sale of a 15% stake in June. UK Asset Resolution (UKAR) Expected proceeds: \u00a313bn Ever since James Leigh-Pemberton, chairman of UK Financial Investments, wrote to the chancellor in March saying that market conditions could be favourable, there has been an inevitability about the divestment of the government\u2019s mortgage assets. The assets, once part of the loan books of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, were ready to be sold, he said. The former Credit Suisse boss, son of former Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton, advised Osborne that the assets are increasingly attractive as the mortgages were taken out before the banking crisis and are now benefiting from the rise in UK house prices. The OBR calculates that the government will raise around \u00a313bn from these sales, more than a third of the sell-off total. Osborne might rejoice at getting such assets off the government\u2019s books, but most probably in a sale to a private equity firm or financial services group \u2013 these are very different assets from the utilities shares that fuelled the 1980s privatisation spree. The Student Loan Book Estimated proceeds: \u00a312bn The government is expecting to raise around \u00a312bn over five years from selling part of the student loan book. The OBR assumes the sales will be evenly spread across the five years from 2015-16. Again, investors interested in buying student loan assets will not be the same as the risk-hungry wannabe share owners who snapped up new issues from privatised companies in the 1980s. King\u2019s Cross Central Partnership Expected proceeds: \u00a3360m The OBR has included \u00a3360m from the expected sale of the government\u2019s stake in King\u2019s Cross Central Partnership, the company behind the redevelopment of the King\u2019s Cross area in north London. Potential sale candidates Urenco It is not just Osborne who is keen to sell the government\u2019s one-third stake in nuclear fuel processor Urenco. Back in 2006, Gordon Brown was also said to be considering selling it. But the company\u2019s split ownership structure means deals have been difficult to pull off: the UK and Dutch governments, and two German utilities, all have stakes. Channel 4 There have been hints that the government is considering privatising the state-owned broadcaster Channel 4. Launched in 1982, C4 has a public service remit and funds itself through advertising. According to reports, the channel could be worth around \u00a31bn, and it is likely to attract interest from media groups looking for a foothold in the British broadcasting market. Opponents say it is hard to imagine a meaningful public remit being maintained in the event of a sale; if they are right, this might make Channel 4 even more attractive to a trade buyer. Under the coalition, the Liberal Democrats opposed privatising Channel 4, but after securing their outright majority the Conservatives might be emboldened. Network Rail The government would love to be shot of Network Rail, with its poor record in recent times, including recurring problems at London Bridge. But, with the company\u2019s near-\u00a340bn debt mountain and uncertain future financing needs, an outright privatisation plan as favoured by the Institute of Economic Affairs may well be too difficult to achieve. There have been reports that management would like to bring in an adviser who would look to recruit a private sector shareholder, with the hope that a new investor would reduce government interference. Certainly, change appears to be in the air. However, the financial demise of predecessor Railtrack in 2001, and the then Labour government\u2019s refusal to bail out shareholders, underlines the potential risk to investors. Ordnance Survey, Companies House and more There is a slew of smaller state-owned organisations \u2013 mapping agency Ordnance Survey, the Met Office weather forecasting service, the Land Registry and Companies House among them \u2013 that could be candidates for full privatisation if the government really wanted to do it. Some of these \u2013 Ordnance Survey for example \u2013 have already been transformed into government-owned companies. This was the route taken with Royal Mail before that was fully privatised.",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne\u2019s decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/uk-government-starts-royal-bank-of-scotland-sell-off-rbs\" title=\"\">begin selling down the government stake in Royal Bank of Scotland</a> has paved the way, many feel, for a glut of government asset sales that prompts comparisons with the Thatcher era.</p> <p>Critics complained that the RBS share sale crystallised a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/04/rbs-sell-off-george-osborne-defends-1bn-loss\" title=\"\">\u00a31.1bn loss on the government\u2019s stake</a>, which it has held since its rescue of the bank following the financial meltdown. But for the chancellor, it represents the first phase of a series of sell-offs that will raise \u00a332bn this year and a further \u00a332bn by the end of this parliament in 2019-20, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p> <p>Other assets to be sold off include shares in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/government-sells-stake-lloyds\" title=\"\">Lloyds Banking Group</a> (also bailed out in 2008) and Royal Mail, more RBS shares, assets relating to the student loan book and mortgages taken out with failed institutions Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley.</p> <p>If Osborne succeeds, he will raise more from the sale of state assets in a single year than even Lady Thatcher did in 1987 \u2013 when her government sold \u00a321bn worth of shares in British Airways, the British Airports Authority, British Petroleum, Rolls-Royce and the Royal Ordnance Factories.</p> <p>Osborne is boastful about the scale of his sell-off programme, saying in his budget speech that it will \u201cdeliver the largest privatisation proceeds of all time, higher than the previous record in 1987\u201d.</p> <p>But there are very real differences between the two eras. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/29/short-history-of-privatisation\" title=\"\">Thatcher\u2019s selling spree</a> was predominantly of equity stakes in previously nationalised industries. Osborne\u2019s is split pretty evenly between a sell-down of equity in part-owned companies and the disposal of mortgage assets.</p> <p>There is also less of a push towards popular capitalism this time. The sales of shares in Lloyds and RBS have been aimed solely at institutional investors. And an attempt to entice retail investors to buy shares in Royal Mail ended in controversy when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/10/royal-mail-shares-thousands-fail-applications\" title=\"\">those ordering above \u00a310,000 worth received nothing</a>.</p> <p>Rather, Osborne\u2019s motivation appears to be to pull out of areas in which he believes the state should not be involved, and to raise cash to cut the national debt. With those aims in mind, the chancellor has a long potential auction list.</p> <h2><strong>Committed for sale</strong></h2> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong><br><strong>Expected proceeds: \u00a323.2bn</strong><br>The government expects to reduce its 73% stake to 25% during the lifetime of the parliament. Now the first tranche of shares has been sold, Osborne is hoping the attractiveness of RBS as an investment will increase, even though many analysts in the City have, in the short term at least, been bearish about the bank\u2019s shares.</p> <p>Those who are more bullish about RBS\u2019s valuation argue that with 79% of the shares previously held by the government, the stock was pretty illiquid and therefore unattractive to hold. As more shares trade on the public markets, the hope is that index funds \u2013 which track particular stock market indices \u2013 will have to hold it, and this will increase its attractiveness.</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility assumes that selling down the RBS stake will raise \u00a35.8bn a year for four years, to take the government\u2019s holding down to 25% by the end of the parliament. Bankers think the sheer volume of shares to be sold makes the task a tricky one. But Osborne has already shown he does not mind selling the bank\u2019s stock off at a bargain price.</p> <p><strong>Lloyds Bank</strong><br><strong>Expected proceeds: \u00a313bn</strong><br>In June, Osborne announced that he wanted to \u201creturn Lloyds to the private sector over the coming year\u201d. On that basis, the OBR expects the government to sell around \u00a313bn of shares in the bank in 2015-16, some of which will be sold directly to retail investors.</p> <p>Shares in Lloyds are likely to remain attractive to investors, barring major regulatory mishaps: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/27/lloyds-pays-antonio-horta-osorio-11m-resumes-dividend-after-six-years\" title=\"\">the banking group resumed paying dividends to investors this year</a>.</p> <p><strong>Royal Mail</strong><br><strong>Expected proceeds: \u00a31.5bn</strong><br>Bankers describe the sale of the government\u2019s remaining 15% of Royal Mail as a straightforward task. For this financial year, the OBR is including proceeds of around \u00a31.5bn from this and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/11/government-sells-15-percent-of-royal-mail-750m-pounds\" title=\"\">sale of a 15% stake in June</a>.</p> <p><strong>UK Asset Resolution (UKAR)</strong><br><strong>Expected proceeds: \u00a313bn</strong><br>Ever since James Leigh-Pemberton, chairman of UK Financial Investments, wrote to the chancellor in March saying that market conditions could be favourable, there has been an inevitability about the divestment of the government\u2019s mortgage assets. The assets, once part of the loan books of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, were ready to be sold, he said.</p> <p>The former Credit Suisse boss, son of former Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton, advised Osborne that the assets are increasingly attractive as the mortgages were taken out before the banking crisis and are now benefiting from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/04/uk-house-prices-up-july-stamp-duty-revenue-falls\" title=\"\">rise in UK house prices</a>.</p> <p>The OBR calculates that the government will raise around \u00a313bn from these sales, more than a third of the sell-off total. Osborne might rejoice at getting such assets off the government\u2019s books, but most probably in a sale to a private equity firm or financial services group \u2013 these are very different assets from the utilities shares that fuelled the 1980s privatisation spree.</p> <p><strong>The Student Loan Book</strong><br><strong>Estimated proceeds: \u00a312bn</strong><br>The government is expecting to raise around \u00a312bn over five years from selling part of the student loan book. The OBR assumes the sales will be evenly spread across the five years from 2015-16. Again, investors interested in buying student loan assets will not be the same as the risk-hungry wannabe share owners who snapped up new issues from privatised companies in the 1980s.</p> <p><strong>King\u2019s Cross Central Partnership</strong><br><strong>Expected proceeds: \u00a3360m</strong><br>The OBR has included \u00a3360m from the expected sale of the government\u2019s stake in King\u2019s Cross Central Partnership, the company behind the redevelopment of the King\u2019s Cross area in north London.</p> <h2><strong>Potential sale candidates</strong></h2> <p><strong>Urenco</strong><br>It is not just Osborne who is keen to sell the government\u2019s one-third stake in nuclear fuel processor Urenco. Back in 2006, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/may/08/energy.business\" title=\"\">Gordon Brown was also said to be considering selling it</a>. But the company\u2019s split ownership structure means deals have been difficult to pull off: the UK and Dutch governments, and two German utilities, all have stakes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd4407bbe2852cb34e803931d2123c43a3dd6707\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/7/1438957730362/b3ecc666-2b26-44c5-9c6e-5278879277e1-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"A privatised Channel 4 would struggle to keep to its public service remit.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A privatised Channel 4 would struggle to keep to its public service remit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Channel 4</strong><br>There have been hints that the government is considering privatising the state-owned broadcaster Channel&#xa0;4. Launched in 1982, C4 has a public service remit and funds itself through advertising.</p> <p>According to reports, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/channel-4-could-be-sold-for-1bn-by-a-new-tory-government-10061986.html\" title=\"\">the channel could be worth around \u00a31bn</a>, and it is likely to attract interest from media groups looking for a foothold in the British broadcasting market.</p> <p>Opponents say it is hard to imagine a meaningful public remit being maintained in the event of a sale; if they are right, this might make Channel 4 even more attractive to a trade buyer.</p> <p>Under the coalition, the Liberal Democrats opposed privatising Channel 4, but after securing their outright majority the Conservatives might be emboldened.</p> <p><strong>Network Rail</strong><br>The government would love to be shot of Network Rail, with its poor record in recent times, including recurring problems <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/05/rail-commuters-hit-more-delays-london-bridge-station\" title=\"\">at London Bridge</a>. But, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/24/network-rail-funding-gap-scuppers-five-year-investment-plan\" title=\"\">with the company\u2019s near-\u00a340bn debt mountain and uncertain future financing needs</a>, an outright privatisation plan <a href=\"http://www.iea.org.uk/in-the-media/media-coverage/its-time-for-network-rail-to-be-privatised\" title=\"\">as favoured by the Institute of Economic Affairs</a> may well be too difficult to achieve.</p> <p>There have been reports that management <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/privatisation-row-as-the-government-tries-to-fix-debtridden-network-rail-10383120.html\" title=\"\">would like to bring in an adviser who would look to recruit a private sector shareholder</a>, with the hope that a new investor would reduce government interference. Certainly, change appears to be in the air. However, the financial demise of predecessor Railtrack in 2001, and the then Labour government\u2019s refusal to bail out shareholders, underlines the potential risk to investors.</p> <p><strong>Ordnance Survey, Companies House and more</strong><br>There is a slew of smaller state-owned organisations \u2013 mapping agency Ordnance Survey, the Met Office weather forecasting service, the Land Registry and Companies House among them \u2013 that could be candidates for full privatisation if the government really wanted to do it.</p> <p>Some of these \u2013 Ordnance Survey for example \u2013 have already been transformed into government-owned companies. This was the route taken with Royal Mail before that was fully privatised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"724d08c87092f3dfb6d491490b55c9f041568901\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/7/1438957840417/d7ec8f6e-270e-43fa-93d2-7b48ec6270b3-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Selling off the remainder of Royal Mail is expected to be straightforward.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Selling off the remainder of Royal Mail is expected to be straightforward.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  /AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
