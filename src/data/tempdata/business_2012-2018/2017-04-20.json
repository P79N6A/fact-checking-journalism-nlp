      "bodyText": "Donald Trump set the stage for a global fight over steel on Thursday, announcing an investigation into whether cheap imports are a threat to national security. At an Oval Office ceremony, surrounded by US steel executives, Trump signed an executive order calling for the commerce department to assess effects of steel imports on US defense at a time when he has ordered a military buildup. \u201cSteel is critical to both our economy and our military. This is not an area where we can afford to become dependent on foreign countries,\u201d Trump said in what he dubbed a \u201chistoric day for American steel\u201d. The president said he had promised to take action on behalf of American workers, which was \u201cone of the primary reasons I\u2019m sitting here today as president\u201d. \u201cSince the day I took office, I have followed through on that promise big league, beginning with our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d He said he was proud of that withdrawal, which would have been \u201canother Nafta disaster\u201d. The announcement is the most concrete move the administration has made on trade since Trump was elected after a campaign when he argued cheap imports were \u201ckilling\u201d US manufacturers. Speaking ahead of the signing Wilbur Ross, secretary of commerce, said a 19.6% increase in steel imports in the first quarter has had \u201ca very serious impact on the domestic industry\u201d. Ross said the US had placed more than 150 antidumping and duty orders on steel products, but they had \u201cnot substantially alleviated the negative effects that unfairly traded imports have had on the United States steel industry. \u201cRepeated efforts by the United States to encourage other countries to reduce and address the underlying causes of excess capacity in the steel market have had little meaningful effect,\u201d he said. Ross said that left unhindered the present situation could undermine the ability of American steel producers to continue investment, research and development, and reduce or eliminate the jobs needed to \u201cmaintain a pool of skilled workers essential for the continued development of advanced steel manufacturing\u201d. China\u2019s government-owned steel industry represents almost half of the world\u2019s steelmaking. On the campaign trail Trump railed against Chinese steel and said cheap imports were \u201ckilling\u201d US manufacturers and that foreign nations were \u201cdumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and steel companies.\u201d The US steel industry has blamed China for driving down global prices in order to crush competition and as a result causing US job losses. Last year John Ferriola, chairman of US steel company Nucor Corporation and one of Trump\u2019s guests for the signing, told Congress China was \u201ca company disguised as a country engaged in economic warfare\u201d. The US steel industry is now operating at only 71% of its capacity, with imports accounting for more than a quarter of domestic steel market, Ross said. While the investigation will appeal to his voters, it is all but certain to worsen trade relations with Beijing and comes just days after Trump backed down from his accusations that China was a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d. In January China criticised \u201cextreme\u201d tariffs on its exports and said it had already been hit with a record number of retaliatory trade measures from rival economies and trading blocs in 2016. \u201cTrade disputes are becoming increasingly politicised, measures are increasingly extreme and final tariff rates are relatively high,\u201d said ministry spokesman Sun Jiwen. Trump insisted the decision had \u201cnothing to do with China\u201d. \u201cThis has to do with worldwide, what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dumping problem is a worldwide problem.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The president of the World Bank has told Theresa May that cutting the UK\u2019s aid budget could lead to an increase in conflict, terrorism and migration and would damage Britain\u2019s international reputation. In a strongly worded response to reports that the government was considering dropping its commitment to devote 0.7% of national income to aid each year, Jim Yong Kim said the money the UK provided was vital not just for developing countries but for the future of the world. His comments came after Bill Gates told the Guardian that lives would be lost in Africa if the government dropped the commitment because plans to eradicate malaria would be jeopardised. Like Kim, the Microsoft founder also stressed that the UK would lose influence. At \u00a313.3bn in 2016, Britain\u2019s aid budget was the third biggest in the world after Germany and US. Of the G7, only Britain and Germany currently meet the UN\u2019s 0.7% target for aid, and Britain is also one of the biggest donors to the World Bank. Kim said the UK\u2019s Department for International Development had played a vital role in efforts to rid the world of poverty. \u201cWe were extremely encouraged when prime minister David Cameron fulfilled the commitment to 0.7%,\u201d Kim said at a press conference to mark the opening of the spring meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. \u201cIt is important for people in the UK to understand just how significant that was in expanding the UK\u2019s influence in the world. It would be very unfortunate for the UK to reduce its efforts. I would say the 0.7% that has been committed to is critically, critically important, not just for developing countries but for the future of the world.\u201d The 0.7% pledge was originally made by Labour but it was only achieved after Cameron became prime minister in 2010. May is under pressure from the Tory right, Ukip and Conservative-supporting papers to cut aid spending. She pointedly refused this week to say she would keep to the commitment in the event of winning the forthcoming general election, prompting strong speculation that it will be abandoned. Kim said Britain\u2019s aid money had never been more important, joining a chorus of voices opposing the idea of reneging on the 0.7% pledge. Romilly Greenhill, a senior research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, said it allowed Britain to punch above its weight on the international stage. \u201cBill Gates is right to say Britain\u2019s aid contribution is saving lives and putting children in school,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first message is that it is needed, the second is that it is effective, and the third is that, in terms of a global Britain, it is very significant. \u201cI\u2019ve observed a lot of UN negotiations and developing countries and richer countries see it as a real indicator of Britain\u2019s place on the international stage. It buys Britain a lot of kudos. Particularly when we leave the EU, it will demonstrate that we are punching above our weight.\u201d Tamsyn Barton, the chief executive of Bond, the UK membership body for development groups, said: \u201cIt would be a travesty if the UK\u2019s 0.7% commitment, made to help the world\u2019s poorest people, was not committed to by all political parties. This is not the time to shirk our global responsibility or step back from the world.\u201d Charlie Matthews, ActionAid\u2019s head of advocacy, said: \u201cA truly global Britain must be outward looking. UK aid and the commitment to 0.7% is helping to feed millions of hungry people in east Africa whose lives have been devastated by drought. Aid saves lives and helps the world\u2019s poorest people, especially women and girls.\u201d Jeff Crisp, a research associate at the Refugees Studies Centre at the University of Oxford, said dropping the aid pledge was not inevitable, but would be one way for May to appease the Tory right before difficult Brexit negotiations. \u201cShe will have to appease the right wing of her own party. One of the ways will be to get rid of it or to reduce it. Another way she could appease the right wing of the party would be to increase the way the overseas development budget will be used for things that are not strictly development.\u201d Kim said: \u201cWe\u2019re meeting at a time when we face overlapping crises, both natural and man made, all which add urgency to our mission: conflict; climate shocks; the worst refugee crisis since the second world war; and famine in parts of East Africa and Yemen, which the UN has called the worst in 70 years. With the famine in particular, the world was caught unprepared.\u201d Kim said the multiple crises were linked to rising aspirations prompted by greater internet access. Aspiration matched by opportunity could create dynamic societies, he added. \u201cBut if those rising aspirations meet frustration we are very worried about more and more countries going down the path to fragility, conflict, violence, extremism and, of course, eventually migration. Because the other thing that access to the internet does is it increases people\u2019s desire to migrate.\u201d Kim said there was a need to create successful developing countries that would buy goods from the developed west and so ensure that rising aspirations were not met with frustration. \u201cThis is not something that\u2019s theoretical. It\u2019s happening in front of our eyes. People have to think of aid as more than just giveaways.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Tata Steel offers \u00a3520m pensions payment in bid to secure future", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata Steel could pay more than \u00a3500m into its UK pension scheme as part of a deal with regulators that involves the Pension Protection Fund taking a stake in the business. The Indian-owned company needs to find a solution to its pension scheme to secure the future of its UK operations, which employs 8,000 workers and includes the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. Tata Steel is trying to hive off its historic liabilities before merging its European steel operations with German company ThyssenKrupp. However, talks between Tata Steel and the Pensions Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund have dragged on for months and sources close to the negotiations say any deal is still a long way from being struck. Tata has offered to make a one-off payment of \u00a3520m into the pension scheme, according to reports in India, in return for it releasing a guarantee that it holds over the company\u2019s assets in Europe. The scheme, which is called the British Steel pension scheme, has 130,000 members and liabilities of \u00a315bn, making it one of the largest in the country. Trustees for the scheme warned earlier this year that the deficit could rise to between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn without support from Tata Steel. ThyssenKrupp is reluctant to take on the burden of the pension scheme as part of any merger so Tata Steel has been in talks with regulators about spinning it off or, a more likely outcome, letting it enter the PPF, a government-backed pensions lifeboat funded by a levy paid by UK pension schemes. This would lead to workers suffering a 10% cut to their benefits but can only happen if Tata Steel persuades the regulator that it is on the brink of insolvency and cannot continue to support the pension scheme. Tata will also have to provide hundreds of millions of pounds to help fund the scheme and the PPF can demand a stake of up to 33% in Tata Steel UK so that it benefits from the future success of the business. Pensions experts said the Pensions Regulator and the PPF, which both need to approve any settlement, were likely to seek more than the \u00a3520m offered. John Ralfe, an independent pensions expert, said: \u201cBHS changes everything. I am genuinely surprised they got \u00a3363m out of Sir Philip [as part of a settlement for the BHS pension scheme]. \u00a3520m is a starting point, but it is only a starting point.\u201d Tata Steel declined to comment, while the Pensions Regulator reiterated that there were significant issues to be resolved as part of the negotiations. The Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe continue to have discussions with the employer and the trustee about the future of the British Steel pension scheme. There are still significant issues to be resolved and we will consider all proposals carefully in light of their impact upon the 130,000 pension scheme members and PPF levy payers.\u201d The PPF said: \u201cThe Pension Protection Fund is committed to working with all parties to find a solution that is in the best interest of our levy payers and the 11m people who are protected by us, including the members of the British Steel scheme. Members of the scheme can be reassured that we are there to protect them if required.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The new chief executive of Debenhams is to give the department store chain an expensive makeover after admitting some shops looked tired and old and customers had to go on a \u201ctreasure hunt\u201d to find what they wanted. Sergio Bucher, who joined the retailer from Amazon in October, polled 16,000 shoppers before drafting a turnaround plan to focus on \u201csocial shopping\u201d and making store visits a \u201cfun leisure activity\u201d. As part of the overhaul, Bucher warned that 10 of its 176 stores had been earmarked for closure unless their performance improved and several warehouses would close, putting several hundred jobs at risk. \u201cSome of our stores look tired and old, the online experience is not as good as it could be and we have so many promotions our customers struggle to know when it\u2019s the right time to shop,\u201d said the Debenhams chief executive, Sergio Bucher. The retailer will devote more floor space to new restaurant brands as well as nail and blow-dry bars as women prioritise spending on treats such as facials over wardrobe updates. It will look to turn \u201cfunctional\u201d trips to pick up internet orders into \u201cexperiences\u201d by offering the chance to combine the collection with a consultation with a personal shopper and a glass of prosecco. The need for shop closures raised eyebrows in the City as the chain was trumpeting the potential for it to expand to 240 stores five years ago. To cut costs, Debenhams is shutting one of its three main warehouses, in Lodge Farm, Northamptonshire, which employs 220 people, as well as 10 smaller warehouses, all run by the logistics company DHL. The update came as Debenhams posted a pre-tax profit of \u00a387.8m in the six months to 4 March, down by 6.4%. Debenhams is best known for the Designers at Debenhams collections created over the past two decades by designers including Jasper Conran, Julien Macdonald and Ben de Lisi. Designer Betty Jackson has already been dropped and Bucher admitted other brands \u201chad lost some of their currency\u201d and would be reviewed. GlobalData analyst Kate Ormrod said the crux of Debenhams problems was that it sold \u201cundesirable product\u201d, especially in clothing, where it has been losing market share for the past five years. \u201cThe plan to manage the Designers at Debenhams portfolio more robustly is long overdue,\u201d said Omrod. \u201cThe axe needs to fall on many brands, with the prime targets being Floozie by Frost French and Star by Julien Macdonald. Given the success of Nine by Savannah Miller, there is still life in the concept, but refreshing its designers more regularly is a must.\u201d Debenhams, which employs 30,000 people, said it was moving 2,000 staff from back office roles on to the shopfloor in a bid to improve customer service. It will \u201cdeclutter\u201d stores by reducing clothing options, such as colour, by 12%. The turnaround plan will involve increasing annual investment in stores and website from \u00a3130m to \u00a3150m, most of which will be spent on upgrading the mobile and online platform. The shakeup will cost an extra \u00a3100m in total over the next three years. \u201cDebenhams is like a treasure hunt. There is some great stuff, but you have to work hard to find it,\u201d said Bucher. \u201cThe backdrop to this is that our customer has changed and we need to change, too. Customers are increasingly living their lives on mobile phones.\u201d Bucher was brought into replace Michael Sharp in 2016 after shareholders pushed for a change at the top following a series of poor results and profit warnings. But his grand plan did not seen to impress the City with the shares closing down 5% on Thursday. Some analysts complained that Bucher failed to set himself any targets or quantify the likely return on investment. \u201cThis turnaround plan seems less radical than what might be ultimately required for Debenhams to remain relevant on the high street,\u201d said Jon Copesake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cJust 10 proposed store closures is modest given the size of Debenhams\u2019 national store network. Equally, in-store dining and beauty services could fall short in their endeavours to recapture footfall. Debenhams are taking a step in the right direction but it needs to be the first of many.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Virgin Money chief: 'I have battled with mental health all my life'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Jayne-Anne Gadhia was once turned down for a promotion, her boss provided two reasons for his decision: she lacked a thick skin and the ability to bullshit. Twenty five years on \u2013 and after making it to the top of the banking sector to become chief executive of Virgin Money \u2013 Gadhia reckons she still doesn\u2019t possess either of those characteristics. Rather than growing a thick skin, Gadhia sticks her fingers in her ears to illustrate her own \u201cla la la\u201d approach to put-downs. And she insists her motto of \u201cebo\u201d (wanting to make everyone better off) is not nonsense. \u201cI hope I haven\u2019t got a thick skin and don\u2019t bullshit,\u201d said Gadhia in her office above one of Virgin Money\u2019s branches \u2013 which the lender insists are called \u201clounges\u201d \u2013 just off London\u2019s Piccadilly. \u201cThat\u2019s for somebody else to judge. I do think the culture that required [those characteristics] has changed.\u201d The anecdote is one of many in Gadhia\u2019s autobiography, The Virgin Banker, in which she also talks candidly about her battle with depression, particularly after the birth of her daughter Amy in 2002, after six attempts at IVF, and again three years ago when she had to suppress suicidal thoughts at the same time as Virgin Money was preparing for a stock market flotation. \u201cI judge my own mental health these days by my weight. I have battled with it all my life,\u201d she writes in the book, the proceeds of which are going to Heads Together, the mental health charity that has recently been benefiting from the high-profile support of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. \u201cWhen I am slim and physically fit, then I am in good shape mentally,\u201d says Gadhia. \u201cAnd when I am struggling mentally, I decrease the running and increase the chocolate. But, if that is as bad as it gets, then I can manage \u2013 despite the wardrobe problems this creates.\u201d Gadhia says that revealing her mental health problems was not the purpose of the book, which she wrote on her Blackberry during last year\u2019s summer holiday. The idea was to tell the story of Virgin Money, which is backed by Sir Richard Branson. The business started in 1994 when the insurer Norwich Union \u2013 her then employer \u2013 linked up with Branson\u2019s Virgin Group to launch a savings and pensions product. In 2001, part of Virgin Money was taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland and Gadhia went with it. But she quit in 2006, blaming the culture at the Edinburgh-based bank and returned to the core Virgin business.. At RBS she claims she raised the alarm about accounting issues, the sale of payment protection insurance, and rejected attempts to package up mortgages in the style of securitisations which were later to be the undoing of Northern Rock, the bank that was nationalised in 2008. Gadhia eventually took over the \u201cgood\u201d part of Northern Rock in 2011. With hindsight she points to four reasons for RBS\u2019s demise: it grew too quickly; did not have enough capital; lacked diversity at the top \u2013 run by \u201cwhite Scottish men\u201d, she says; and developed a culture where managers thought they were masters of the universe. The RBS bankers also partied hard, she says. Gadhia tells how she saw bankers with blisters and bandages on their thumbs after setting them alight in sambuca drinking games \u2013 events she did not attend \u2013 and describes a female colleague who believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Her personal profile rose after the Northern Rock deal. More accustomed to being an outsider trying to break into the City establishment \u2013 at one point in the interview she describes herself as \u201cthis rather strange woman\u201d \u2013 Gadhia sat next to George Osborne when he was delivering his high-profile Mansion House speech two years ago, was one of David Cameron\u2019s business advisers, and still leads a Treasury-backed initiative to boost diversity in financial services. She was also a vocal supporter of the Remain campaign, but she insists she is not now a \u201cremoaner\u201d. While Virgin\u2019s shares lost a third of their value in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, they have since regained much of that dip and are back above their float price. The bank\u2019s first-quarter results on Tuesday will be an indicator of any hit from the Brexit vote. Gadhia says that in writing the book \u201cI was learning quite a lot about myself\u201d and that to be successful, you need supporters. In her own case, a key supporter was the late Sir Brian Pitman who ran Lloyds Bank before becoming the chairman of Virgin Money after he retired. Unsurprisingly, she names Branson as another supporter. About once a year she visits Branson\u2019s Necker Island home in the Caribbean and she clearly admires the serial entrepreneur who appeared via video link at this week\u2019s book launch \u2013 held in the Virgin Group\u2019s Roof Gardens in Kensington, west London. \u201cAll of this \u2013 I hope this doesn\u2019t sound naff, the whole thing is a privilege. I\u2019ve got a completely normal background, with working-class parents, married to a guy who didn\u2019t have shoes to put on his feet when he came to this country from Kenya at the age of nine.\u201d Her husband Ashok \u2013 she took his name on marriage \u2013 gave up his career to look after their daughter. Gadhia draws upon their experience of being a mixed-race couple for her hopes for women\u2019s\u2019 equality and mental health. She wants those issues to become as unquestioningly accepted as her mixed race marriage now is. \u201cOver the 30 years Ash and I have been married that change has been profound.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Jayne-Anne Gadhia was once turned down for a promotion, her boss provided two reasons for his decision: she lacked a thick skin and the ability to bullshit. Twenty five years on \u2013 and after making it to the top of the banking sector to become chief executive of Virgin Money \u2013 Gadhia reckons she still doesn\u2019t possess either of those characteristics.</p> <p>Rather than growing a thick skin, Gadhia sticks her fingers in her ears to illustrate her own \u201cla la la\u201d approach to put-downs. And she insists her motto of \u201cebo\u201d (wanting to make everyone better off) is not nonsense.</p> <p>\u201cI hope I haven\u2019t got a thick skin and don\u2019t bullshit,\u201d said Gadhia in her office above one of Virgin Money\u2019s branches \u2013 which the lender insists are called \u201clounges\u201d \u2013 just off London\u2019s Piccadilly. \u201cThat\u2019s for somebody else to judge. I do think the culture that required [those characteristics] has changed.\u201d</p> <p>The anecdote is one of many in Gadhia\u2019s autobiography, The Virgin Banker, in which she also talks candidly about her battle with depression, particularly after the birth of her daughter Amy in 2002, after six attempts at IVF, and again three years ago when she had to suppress suicidal thoughts at the same time as Virgin Money was preparing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/28/virgin-money-stock-market-floatation\">for a stock market flotation</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI judge my own mental health these days by my weight. I have battled with it all my life,\u201d she writes in the book, the proceeds of which are going to Heads Together, the mental health charity that has recently been benefiting from the high-profile support of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. </p> <p>\u201cWhen I am slim and physically fit, then I am in good shape mentally,\u201d says Gadhia. \u201cAnd when I am struggling mentally, I decrease the running and increase the chocolate. But, if that is as bad as it gets, then I can manage \u2013 despite the wardrobe problems this creates.\u201d</p> <p>Gadhia says that revealing her mental health problems was not the purpose of the book, which she wrote on her Blackberry during last year\u2019s summer holiday. The idea was to tell the story of Virgin Money, which is backed by Sir Richard Branson. The business started in 1994 when the insurer Norwich Union \u2013 her then employer \u2013 linked up with Branson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/virgin-group\">Virgin Group</a> to launch a savings and pensions product. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b849701bef21642bd5e001050af10d073cd00bcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b849701bef21642bd5e001050af10d073cd00bcb/177_90_3668_2200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jayne-Anne Gadhia talks to Sir Richard Branson about his views before the EU referendum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Remain voter Jayne-Anne Gadhia talks to Sir Richard Branson about his views before the EU referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Pruchnie/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2001, part of Virgin Money was taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland and Gadhia went with it. But she quit in 2006, blaming the culture at the Edinburgh-based bank and returned to the core Virgin business..</p> <p>At RBS she claims she raised the alarm about accounting issues, the sale of payment protection insurance, and rejected attempts to package up mortgages in the style of securitisations which were later to be the undoing of Northern Rock, the bank that was nationalised in 2008. Gadhia eventually took over the \u201cgood\u201d part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/17/northern-rock-virgin-money-taxpayer\">Northern Rock in 2011</a>.</p> <p>With hindsight she points to four reasons for RBS\u2019s demise: it grew too quickly; did not have enough capital; lacked diversity at the top \u2013 run by \u201cwhite Scottish men\u201d, she says; and developed a culture where managers thought they were masters of the universe.</p> <p>The RBS bankers also partied hard, she says. Gadhia tells how she saw bankers with blisters and bandages on their thumbs after setting them alight in sambuca drinking games \u2013 events she did not attend \u2013 and describes a female colleague who believed she was expected to sleep with her manager.</p> <p>Her personal profile rose after the Northern Rock deal.

While Virgin\u2019s shares lost a third of their value in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, they have since regained much of that dip and are back above their float price.

      "bodyText": "France\u2019s stock market has surged today as excitement mounts ahead of Sunday\u2019s presidential vote. The CAC 40 outperformed other European indices to end the day 1.7% higher. Almost every share gained ground in a broad-based rally, led by financial companies and industrial firms. Shares were boosted by forecasts that independent candidate Emmanuel Macron would win the race to succeed Francois Hollande -- even though opinion polls should be treated with plenty of caution these days..... The euro has also held onto this morning\u2019s gains, and is trading at a three-week high of $1.076 tonight. Joshua Mahony of IG says traders are pretty confident that Macron will win in the second round of voting, on May 8th. The stability we have seen in the markets today is a clear nod to the blas\u00e9 outlook that the trading community is holding with regards to this weekend\u2019s French election. The first round is widely expected to result in a toss-up between Le Pen and Macron, but most expect voters to team up against Le Pen in the second round. The threat of an upset seems likely to be negated by the structure of the French democratic system. But could Francois Fillon spring a surprise? Marchel Alexandrovich of stockbroking firm Jefferies argues that Fillon\u2019s popularity with older voters could be decisive: For example, one of the latest French polls with a demographic breakdown shows two things: the older voters are more likely to vote, and they still overwhelmingly support Fillon. In fact no candidate carries as much support with any demographic group as Fillon does with the over 65s. And what if Marine Le Pen, or the far-left\u2019s Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, defied the experts? Daniel Christen of Capital Economics explains how a shock result would reignite the eurozone crisis: If either Le Pen or M\u00e9lenchon were to become the next president, there could be a big reaction in the markets. France\u2019s sovereign credit spread would probably surge as fears over her creditworthiness rose. And in our view, it is likely that the euro would fall. Unlike a potential \u201cGrexit\u201d, a \u201cFrexit\u201d would pose an existential threat to the common currency. Even if investors thought that a \u201cFrexit\u201d wouldn\u2019t occur any time soon, the two candidates\u2019 views on monetary policy might be enough to make investors shy away from holding euros. And that\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A reminder, from Sky News, of how close the French election looks: The Economist has just backed Emmanuel Macron for the French presidency. It argues that the centrist candidate can break the mould of French politics and push through reforms to improve the French economy. It\u2019s not really a surprise. But here\u2019s a flavour of the Economist\u2019s argument: Mr Macron is untainted, if only because he is a political outsider. He has never held elected office, though he was the appointed economy minister in the present government. His plans are less bold than Mr Fillon\u2019s, cutting only 120,000 public jobs and \u20ac60bn in spending, but an independent study rates them as equally free-market. Mr Macron is pro-business, but more subtle about it. Instead of abolishing the 35-hour week, he would help companies work around it. Rather than raise the retirement age, he would unify the country\u2019s 35 pension schemes, eventually doing more to enhance labour mobility. Mr Macron is more outward-looking, too. He backs recent EU free-trade deals that Mr Fillon rejects. He is more likely to be able to work with Germany to strengthen the governance of the euro. He is socially liberal, whereas his opponent, close to Roman Catholic traditionalists, opposed gay marriage and wants to limit gay adoption. Mr Fillon would impose immigration quotas and end sanctions against Russia; Mr Macron exhorts the French to live up to their values. The worry is that Mr Macron will not get his reforms through the legislature. Though En Marche!, the party he founded, will run in every constituency in elections to the National Assembly in June, it will struggle to win a majority, unlike Mr Fillon\u2019s Republicans. But do not write off his political skills. In rallies and on TV he has more than held his own. En Marche! is barely a year old, but it has 250,000 members\u2014more than twice as many as the Socialists. His critics say Mr Macron is wishy-washy. But he is the only candidate who has made a full-blooded case for the open society and economy this newspaper believes in. That takes courage\u2014the courage to step outside France\u2019s party system, to defend complex arguments against polarising sound bites and to stand for optimism in an age of identity politics. That is a message all democracies need to hear. More here. A consequential choice for France\u2014and an uncertain one The Economist\u2019s Tom Nuttall tweets: Encouraging news. Consumer confidence in the eurozone has risen to a 25-month high. It\u2019s another sign that the European economy is strengthening. Back in Washington, Christine Lagarde has also taken a swing at Germany\u2019s trade surplus, saying the country\u2019s external imbalances should be addressed. Germany posted a current account surplus of \u20ac253bn, or over 8% of GDP; critics want it to spend, borrow and import more to bring this surplus down. The latest unemployment figures from America show that the US labo(u)r market remains pretty strong. The number of new applications for jobless benefit rose by 10,000 last week, to 244,000 - well below the 300,000 threshold that shows a healthy jobs market. But the continuing claims figure, a wider measure of unemployment, is at its lowest level since 2000. An upbeat-sounding Christine Lagarde has launched this week\u2019s Spring Meeting by calling for a new push for innovation, closer trade ties and a clampdown on tax evasion. The Greek government is hoping to make progress in its negotiations with creditors at the IMF Spring meeting this week. The country\u2019s finance minister, national economy minister and deputy finance minister are all flying to Washington today for crucial debt talks, including with Fund chief Christine Lagarde. Helena Smith reports from Athens Greek officials say the all-important issue of debt \u2013 and ways to reduce it \u2013 will be at the core of talks the finance and national economy ministers, Euclid Tskalotos and Dimitris Papadimitriou, will have in Washington. Tsakalotos, whose first meeting will be with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde on Friday, is hoping that the framework of a debt relief deal can be secured in time for the next Eurogroup meeting of single currency finance ministers on May 22. Athens\u2019 leftist-led government, in a sop to sceptical MPs unnerved by the prospect of further pension cuts and tax increases - concessions made to conclude the long-stalled compliance review at the heart of the country\u2019s latest standoff with creditors - has threatened the measures won\u2019t be implemented if a debt relief deal isn\u2019t cut first even if the unpopular policies aren\u2019t due to be enforced until 2019. Auditors representing Greece\u2019s bailout lenders are expected to return to Athens next week to complete the technical aspects of the review before a staff level agreement is finally wrapped up. Parliament would then legislate the measures before a comprehensive deal, including medium-term debt relief measures, are put before the Eurogroup of finance minister. But as ever nothing is quite as easy as it seems. The IMF, which only this week said it could not participate in the latest bailout programme unless Greece\u2019s debt burden became manageable, projected the country\u2019s primary surplus would be just 2% in 2018, well short of its target of 3.5%. That once again leaves the door wide open for renewed friction between the Fund and euro area member states not least Germany which has made IMF participation a condition of further loan disbursements. In forecasts issued late Wednesday, the IMF attributed Athens\u2019 bigger- than-expected primary surplus of 3.3 percent in 2016 to \u201ctemporary factors.\u201d Greece\u2019s economic recovery is hanging by a thread with many fearing it could be thrown into reverse unless a deal is reached and the uncertainty is ended given the country\u2019s tight \u20ac7.5bn debt repayment deadline early July. But speaking to reporters today, Greece\u2019s government spokesman said the country\u2019s extraordinary over-performance \u201cfinally noted by the Fund\u201d would determine the fiscal path it would take once its current 86 bn euro bailout programme ended in September 2018. The government\u2019s over-arching aim was for primary surpluses to be reduced, he said, so that the Greek economy could regain its potential and achieve the highest possible rates of growth. Over in Washington, world finance ministers and top central bankers are gathering to discuss the state of the global economy. Top of the agenda at the IMF/World Bank Spring Meeting will be the new US government, and its protectionist trade policies. Reuters has more details: \u201cThese meetings will all be about Trump and the implications of his policies for the international agenda,\u201d said Domenico Lombardi, a former IMF board official who is now with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think-tank. He added that IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde is aiming to \u201csocialize\u201d the new administration to the IMF\u2019s agenda and influence its policy choices. Every politician should have a party trick, and Emmanuel Macron has just tweeted his.... Here\u2019s a lookback at the Harris opinion poll over the last couple of of months: The pound is still having a solid enough day, up 0.2% at $1.28. That\u2019s more than two cents higher than Monday morning, before the snap election news. But Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit isn\u2019t impressed: Some analysts think investors are too relaxed about the French election. The FT\u2019s Mehreen Khan explains: \u201cMarkets are unprepared for the worst,\u201d notes Athanasios Vamvakidis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThe worst outcome for markets is if Le Pen and M\u00e9lenchon are in the second round, in our view, as markets could start pricing Frexit risks\u201d Fillon\u2019s late revival in the polls could increase the chances that Marine Le Pen fails to win a place in the final run-off. That could trigger a surge in the euro and in share prices, believes Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She says a Macron-Fillon playoff would be the most \u2018market-friendly\u2019 option. A win for Macron with Fillon in second place would restore faith in centrist politics, which has been eroded ever since last year\u2019s Brexit vote in the UK and Trump\u2019s triumph in the US Presidential election. The eradication of the Far Left and the Far Right candidates in the first round would likely see a collective sigh of relief that it is politics as usual in France. This combination for the second round could unleash a surge in the Cac, a sharp drop in French bond yields and a decent move higher in EUR/USD back towards 1.10, we could also see EUR/GBP recover back towards 0.8570 \u2013 a cluster of key resistance levels. Overall, there is a chance that the market has been wrong-footed once again by the polls, and Le Pen is not guaranteed a spot in the second round. If we are correct, then the political premium that has kept the euro range bound in recent months could evaporate, allowing the single currency to stage a decent rally on the back of a victory for the two moderate, pro EU candidates on Sunday night. One of the more surprising elements of the French election is Francois Fillon\u2019s recent revival. After unexpectedly winning the Republican nomination, Fillon\u2019s campaign was badly hurt by allegations that his wife had been paid for work she\u2019d not done. The Penelope Affair, followed by questions over gifts and consultancy fees, seemed likely to sink Fillon\u2019s chances, and his plans for Thatcherite free market reforms. But instead, he\u2019s been regaining ground - and could yet claim a top-two finish on Sunday. If that happens, Fillon can thank his core support, and his move towards increasingly populist, right-wing policies. My colleague Jon Henley explains: Born in the traditionally Catholic Sarthe department west of Paris, Fillon is the son of a history professor mother and solicitor father. With Penelope, whom he met in Le Mans when she was a student on a year abroad, he has raised five children in a 12th-century chateau. He has abstained or voted against laws on equality between men and women and same-sex marriage and is personally opposed to abortion, though he would not try to repeal the 1975 law that legalised it in France. A year after he was first elected as France\u2019s youngest MP, he opposed the 1982 law that effectively legalised homosexuality. A centre-right gay rights group, GayLib, has described his vision of French society as \u201cclearly hostile to LGBT people\u201d. Fillon has pledged to defend France\u2019s \u201cChristian values\u201d. He would ban medically assisted procreation and use of sperm donors for single women and same-sex couples, and reverse some gay adoption rights. He has also promised to set annual quotas on immigration, restrict foreigners\u2019 rights to French nationality, set the age of criminal responsibility at 16, build 16,000 new prison cells and, in foreign policy, develop more positive ties with Russia. The closing days of the campaign have seen Fillon more openly courting a hard-right vote, evoking France\u2019s sovereignty and identity and promising at his Lille rally to crack down hard on immigration and pursue a zero-tolerance policy on radical Islam. The candidates to become France\u2019s next president have been campaigning for months, including a major TV debate earlier this month. But many voters are still uncertain of who they\u2019ll vote for, and their choices could decide the election. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says: The French election looks very close. Although Macron and Le Pen are expected to make it to the second round, all four candidates are close and 30% of voters are said to be still undecided as ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote. Two interesting weeks ahead in France.\u201d Pollsters have reported that the number of uncommitted French voters is at unprecedented level. This chart, from Teneo Intelligence, shows how last minute changes of heart could boost, or undermine, the leading candidates: The \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d for global financial markets is second-round duel between the equally sharp-tongued Le Pen and Melenchon, says Associated Press\u2019s John Leicester. Victory for either could, in the wake of the Brexit vote, possibly deliver a knockout punch to the EU ambition of ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe because both want to tear up agreements that bind together the 28 EU states. Melenchon says \u201cthe Europe of our dreams is dead.\u201d He proposes \u201cdisobeying treaties from the moment we take power\u201d and negotiating new EU rules followed by a referendum on whether France should leave the bloc it helped found. \u201cWe either change the EU or quit it,\u201d Melenchon\u2019s manifesto says. The \u201ctotalitarian\u201d EU has also long been one of Le Pen\u2019s pet hates and constant target for her virulent nationalist discourse. She wants an in-out referendum on France\u2019s EU membership, a new French franc to replace the common euro currency, and re-imposing French borders to staunch what she describes as out-of-control immigration. Like her father, National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2002, she hopes for an electoral coup by making the runoff. But pollsters suggest that, like him, she would likely lose on May 7 to any of the other top three opponents. Paris\u2019s stock market is on track for its best day since the start of March. The CAC 40 has jumped by 1% today, outperforming the rest of Europe, as investors react to the latest forecasts of a Macron victory. Financial stocks are leading the rally, with BNP Paribas jumping 2.6% and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale gaining 1.9%. Technology and consumer-focused stocks are also up. The FTSE 100 is lagging behind, though, partly due to the rise in the pound this morning. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, explains: The FTSE is weakening once more this morning, as the pound continues its ascent in the wake of Theresa May\u2019s decision to call a snap election in just seven weeks. To many the appreciation of the pound seems counter-intuitive, yet the prospect of a strengthened Tory majority means there is hope that this election could be good for the UK in Brexit negotiations. M&amp;S isn\u2019t the only UK retailer shutting stores. Debenhams has announced plans to close up to 10 shops, and 11 warehouses, as new CEO Sergio Bucher gets to grips with its \u201ctired and old\u201d estate. Newsflash: The government has announced the sale of Britain\u2019s Green Investment Bank to Australian bank Macquarie in a \u00a32.3bn deal (as my colleague Adam Vaughan reported overnight). It\u2019s an unpopular move with environmental activists, who question Macquarie\u2019s commitment to clean energy. Dr Doug Parr, Policy Director at Greenpeace UK, says: \u201cAt a time when the government should be shoring up low carbon industry for post-Brexit Britain, they have given away one of our key tools for advancing green technologies. The hole left by the Green Investment Bank will slow our transition to a clean energy system, set us back on reaching our climate targets, and mean more of the jobs from new sectors will go elsewhere. If the government picks up its pace, the UK could be a world leader in renewable and green technology. But selling a great British success story, which levered private money into eco-projects, to a controversial Australian bank known for asset-stripping, is a disaster. We need investment in the booming clean technology industry in the UK, for skilled jobs, fairer bills and a healthy economy to see us through the next uncertain few years and in to the future.\u201d The FT\u2019s Jim Pickard suspects the deal is being slipped out under the cover of election fever: The euro is climbing higher, now up 0.5% to a new three-week high of $1.077. That\u2019s partly due to general dollar weakness, as well as that French opinion poll suggesting a win for Emmanuel Macron. Retail news: Marks &amp; Spencer is shutting six UK stores, but promising staff that they\u2019ll be offered new positions elsewhere. Here\u2019s the statement. European stock markets will probably fall sharply if the French election delivers a shock result. Marketwatch\u2019s Sara Sj\u00f6lin explains: And here are the two-way risks: A win for either Le Pen or Melenchon would spark a selloff in risk assets and drive French and European equities down 5%-10% by the end of June, Citi said. However, if Macron or Fillon secures the presidency, stocks in Europe could see a 10%-20% rally before the end of the year, they said. The pound is also strengthening this morning, up half a cent at $1.2825 against the US dollar. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever has spotted signs that investors are more confident about UK assets. The yield (or interest rate) on UK gilts (government debt) has fallen in recent weeks, for example, as the price of the bonds has risen. Marine Le Pen\u2019s best hope of victory would come in a run-off against former prime minister Francois Fillon, argues Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence. Barroso believes that many centrist and left-leaning voters might find this choice underwhelming, and not participate in such a second round scenario. He writes: The worst-case scenario in terms of a potential Le Pen victory is a runoff between Fillon and the leader of the National Front. This is especially the case considering the former PM\u2019s recent \u201crightist turn\u201d after he suggested he would include members of an ultra-catholic organization in his administration. Combined with his frequent attacks on the judiciary, this will only make it more difficult for Fillon to credibly moderate his positions in between rounds. The risk is that center-left voters decide to stay at home on 7 May, allowing Le Pen to be elected by voter neglect rather than by voter endorsement. Barroso also agrees that Macron would be a much tougher opponent for Le Pen. This chart confirms that traders have been anxious about the French elections, and the prospect of a eurosceptic winner: Tactical voting will probaly keep Marine Le Pen out of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, argues Kit Nicholl, country risk analyst at IHS Global Insight: In a scenario where Le Pen is pitted against Fillon, or more likely, Macron, voters from the moderate left and right are likely to unite in a so-called \u201cRepublican front\u201d, voting tactically to keep the FN out of power. A Le Pen victory is therefore unlikely but still remains possible, particularly as abstention rates will also play a big role. Furthermore, the occurrence of a major terrorist attack, widespread urban riots, or the disclosure of damning information aimed at discrediting Macron would all have the effect of significantly increasing the FN\u2019s share of the vote. The euro has hit its highest level since the end of March this morning. The single currency gained 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.074, after a new opinion poll suggested centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron will win the French election. Harris Interactive placed Macron on 25% support ahead of Sunday\u2019s first round of voting, ahead of Marine Le Pen (22%). Republican candidate Francois Fillon (19%) and left-winger Jean-Luc Melenchon (also 19%) followed behind. Harris also see Macron comfortably beating Le Pen in the second round of voting in May. The euro has been under pressure from predictions that either Le Pen or Melenchon (or even both) might contest the run-off, as both are extremely critical of the EU and could potentially trigger Frexit. I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Political issues continue to occupy the market\u2019s attention today. The first round of the French presidential election is just three days away, so investors are watching closely to see which candidates make it through to the run-off two weeks later. The race looks rather tight, raising concerns that the eurozone could be dragged into another crisis if the more mainstream candidates stumble. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains: Volatility in the euro has peaked at its highest since before the June referendum as markets weigh the prospects of either Marine Le Pen or Jean-Luc Melenchon \u2013 or both - making the second round. The killer scenario for the euro would be if both candidates make the May 7th runoff as it would raise the very real possibility of France exiting the euro. Current polling gives the nod to Macron and Le Pen, with Macron eventually winning. But with four candidates polling around 20% there is every reason for caution. We\u2019re looking at contingency plans in the event of a Le Pen-Melenchon runoff as this would spark a big selloff in the euro and French government bonds, as well as bank stocks. Britain\u2019s general election also looms over the City, of course, as traders try to calculate the consequences. The latest front pages suggest Theresa May is determined to make Brexit the centrepoint of the campaign: Overnight, Asian shares have been boosted by some solid trade data from Japan. Exports jumped at the fastest pace in two years in March, raising hopes that rising demand from overseas could help the sluggish Japanese economy. There\u2019s plenty of corporate news too, including results from Unilever, Debenhams, and Sky. On the economics side, there\u2019s eurozone construction figures at 10am BST, the weekly US unemployment report at 1.30pm, and eurozone consumer confidence stats at 3pm.",

But here\u2019s a flavour of the Economist\u2019s argument:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Macron is untainted, if only because he is a political outsider. He has never held elected office, though he was the appointed economy minister in the present government. His plans are less bold than Mr Fillon\u2019s, cutting only 120,000 public jobs and \u20ac60bn in spending, but an independent study rates them as equally free-market. Mr Macron is pro-business, but more subtle about it. Instead of abolishing the 35-hour week, he would help companies work around it. Rather than raise the retirement age, he would unify the country\u2019s 35 pension schemes, eventually doing more to enhance labour mobility.</p> <p>Mr Macron is more outward-looking, too. He backs recent EU free-trade deals that Mr Fillon rejects. He is more likely to be able to work with Germany to strengthen the governance of the euro. He is socially liberal, whereas his opponent, close to Roman Catholic traditionalists, opposed gay marriage and wants to limit gay adoption. Mr Fillon would impose immigration quotas and end sanctions against Russia; Mr Macron exhorts the French to live up to their values.</p> <p>The worry is that Mr Macron will not get his reforms through the legislature. Though En Marche!, the party he founded, will run in every constituency in elections to the National Assembly in June, it will struggle to win a majority, unlike Mr Fillon\u2019s Republicans. But do not write off his political skills. In rallies and on TV he has more than held his own. En Marche! is barely a year old, but it has 250,000 members\u2014more than twice as many as the Socialists.</p> <p>His critics say Mr Macron is wishy-washy. But he is the only candidate who has made a full-blooded case for the open society and economy this newspaper believes in. That takes courage\u2014the courage to step outside France\u2019s party system, to defend complex arguments against polarising sound bites and to stand for optimism in an age of identity politics. That is a message all democracies need to hear.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721143-french-go-polls-they-are-angry-and-divided-consequential-choice-franceand\">A consequential choice for France\u2014and an uncertain one</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58f8cc3fe4b05b487c0e4261\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-20T15:03:43.478Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Economist\u2019s Tom Nuttall tweets:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tom_nuttall/status/855070584056799232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our cover this week. <a href=\"https://t.co/GynxZc4Ve6\">pic.twitter.com/GynxZc4Ve6</a></p>&mdash; Tom Nuttall (@tom_nuttall) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_nuttall/status/855070584056799232\">April 20, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58f8cc90e4b0e0ec04f02c0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-20T14:58:53.344Z\">3.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Encouraging news.

Parliament would then legislate the measures before a comprehensive deal, including medium-term debt relief measures, are put before the Eurogroup of finance minister. </p> <p>But as ever nothing is quite as easy as it seems. The IMF, which only this week said it could not participate in the latest bailout programme unless Greece\u2019s debt burden became manageable, projected the country\u2019s primary surplus would be just 2% in 2018, well short of its target of 3.5%. That once again leaves the door wide open for renewed friction between the Fund and euro area member states not least Germany which has made IMF participation a condition of further loan disbursements. </p> <p><strong>In forecasts issued late Wednesday, the IMF attributed Athens\u2019 bigger- than-expected primary surplus of 3.3 percent in 2016 to \u201ctemporary factors.\u201d</strong> Greece\u2019s economic recovery is hanging by a thread with many fearing it could be thrown into reverse unless a deal is reached and the uncertainty is ended given the country\u2019s tight \u20ac7.5bn debt repayment deadline early July. </p> <p>But speaking to reporters today, Greece\u2019s government spokesman said the country\u2019s extraordinary over-performance \u201cfinally noted by the Fund\u201d would determine the fiscal path it would take once its current 86 bn euro bailout programme ended in September 2018. </p> <p>The government\u2019s over-arching aim was for primary surpluses to be reduced, he said, so that the Greek economy could regain its potential and achieve the highest possible rates of growth.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-20T13:36:35.673Z\">at 2.36pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58f8b139e4b05776df18f732\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-20T13:06:14.651Z\">2.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45c544f2d5d7f98690b3a1524b06f66d9828f0bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45c544f2d5d7f98690b3a1524b06f66d9828f0bc/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A security personnel stands next to International Monetary Fund logo at IMF headquarters in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in Washington, world finance ministers and top central bankers are gathering to discuss the state of the global economy.</strong></p> <p>Top of the agenda at the IMF/World Bank Spring Meeting will be the new US government, and its protectionist trade policies.</p> <p>Reuters has more details:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cThese meetings will all be about Trump and the implications of his policies for the international agenda,\u201d said Domenico Lombardi, a former IMF board official who is now with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think-tank.</p> <p>He added that IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde is aiming to \u201csocialize\u201d the new administration to the IMF\u2019s agenda and influence its policy choices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-20T13:15:49.414Z\">at 2.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58f8b1c9e4b05b487c0e41d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-20T13:05:58.301Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Every politician should have a party trick, and Emmanuel Macron has just tweeted his....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/855033309495046144\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">Voil\u00e0. <a href=\"https://t.co/KSd8XHgGtY\">pic.twitter.com/KSd8XHgGtY</a></p>&mdash;

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has announced plans to close six stores, affecting 380 jobs, but the retailer has pledged to find staff alternative posts in nearby outlets. The announcement comes after Debenhams, Britain\u2019s second-largest department store chain, warned that several hundred jobs are at risk as part of a shakeup that will close up to 10 shops and 11 warehouses. M&amp;S said last year that it planned to close 30 UK stores and convert 45 more into food-only shops as part of a business overhaul designed to slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to its ailing clothing ranges. On Thursday, the retailer confirmed that the first \u201cfull-line\u201d stores \u2013 which sell clothing, homeware and food \u2013 to close would be in Portsmouth, Slough, Warrington and Wokingham. It is also closing Simply Food outlets in York\u2019s Monks Cross centre and Worksop. The M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe, said stores would always be an integral part of the business but customers\u2019 shopping habits were changing. \u201cPicking up food for now or tonight rather than doing one big shop, or browsing and shopping online and collecting in store, are great examples of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are committed to adapting our business so that we stay in tune with our customers.\u201d Despite the closure programme, M&amp;S is still opening new stores, with 34 food and two full-line shops due to open in the next six months, expected to create 1,400 jobs. Locations include food halls in London\u2019s Bishopsgate, Huntingdon, Aylesbury and Spinningfields in central Manchester. The new clothing, home and food stores will open in Bracknell and Rushden this summer. City analysts have said M&amp;S has too many stores at a time when sales are transferring to the internet. The retailer has 959 UK shops, comprised of 304 full-line stores and 615 food branches. The shakeup of the company\u2019s estate will mean a reduction of 10% in the floor space devoted to racks of skirts, jumpers and trousers. The plan will cost \u00a3150m over three years. Rowe said the plans would mean \u201cmore M&amp;S colleagues working in an increased number of convenient locations\u201d. \u201cWe will open new stores, some will reduce in size, some will move, some will close and others will convert to food only,\u201d he said. \u201cEach proposal we make will be very carefully considered with our colleagues and customers firmly front of mind. It is our intention that nobody leaves M&amp;S and we will work as hard as possible to ensure that we can deliver against this promise.\u201d The retailer said staff affected by the store closure programme would be offered \u201cguaranteed redeployment\u201d at a nearby branch. In Monks Cross, for example, the company said there is a full-line shop within 500 metres, but in Worksop, the new store it highlights as an alternative employer is 9 miles (14km) away.",

      "bodyText": "Was Greg Clark airing a manifesto promise or signalling government action in the next few days? It was impossible to tell, but the business secretary finally seems to have come to the firm conclusion that energy suppliers are ripping off too many customers. Clark wants to take \u201cmuscular and strong\u201d action to stop the \u201cflagrant mistreatment\u201d of loyal customers who are being \u201cmilked\u201d. Probable translation: he wants a price cap on standard variable tariffs. One can sympathise with the implied analysis of big energy companies\u2019 behaviour. Loyal customers, or those who can\u2019t be bothered to shop around, receive the worst prices, as everybody knows by now. Yet Clark, if he opts for price caps, needs to explain two things. The first is to tell us how he will avoid killing even the inadequate level of competition between suppliers. If standard tariffs are held down by government diktat, it\u2019s a safe bet that fixed tariffs, which would presumably be left alone, will increase. Is Clark prepared to accept that active switchers \u2013 about 30% of the market \u2013 will pay more than they would otherwise? Clark will also have to explain the basis on which he will set a standard tariff. One way would be to order Ofgem to construct a pricing model that takes account of reasonable overheads, makes a few assumptions about wholesale purchasing contracts and then allows a small profit margin for the supplier. Fine in theory, but in practice companies are supposed to duck and weave and buy their energy on different contracts to gain a competitive edge. In a new world, suppliers may decide the approved business model is the only safe one. The result could be that the big firms become even more alike than are today, reducing competition further. Is he prepared for that outcome? To repeat, the suppliers can hardly complain about political intervention. Tariffs that reward loyalty are only starting to appear now but could have been introduced two decades ago. But Clark can\u2019t dodge the consequences. If the government wants to set maximum prices or limit price differentials, it can\u2019t also ignore movements in the wholesale market. It\u2019s the minister who will be blamed when prices for consumers have to go up. The Wright stuff Mike Ashley and Sir Philip Green may shed few tears, but it\u2019s a shame that Iain Wright, the Labour MP who chairs the business select committee, won\u2019t be standing for re-election to parliament. Under Wright\u2019s leadership, the committee has done what it\u2019s supposed to do: selected a few juicy bones and chewed for all it\u2019s worth. The grubby tale of Green\u2019s sale of BHS to a thrice-bankrupt retailing novice was illuminated when the business committee, alongside Frank Field\u2019s work and pensions committee, summoned the main players and called for documentary evidence. We learned more about how Green runs his retail empire \u2013 and the role of hangers-on like Goldman Sachs \u2013 than seemed possible at the outset. A similar forensic approach had already been taken at Sports Direct, where Wright rightly insisted that Ashley should appear in person. An excellent wider report on corporate governance flowed from the two inquiries. It is a better document than the government\u2019s green paper and, let\u2019s hope, has sounded the death knell for the dysfunctional long-term incentive schemes that have inflated boardroom pay. In the distant past, select committees have sometimes been grossly under prepared when tackling business subjects. Those of us who covered the 2007 inquiry into the private equity industry by the Treasury committee remember angry MPs frustrating themselves, and their audience, as they failed to get beyond the jargon. Wright, by contrast, kept his cool and did his homework. That\u2019s all that\u2019s required, and he did it well. Fashion brand seeks fizz Burberry shareholders did splendidly during the boom years for luxury goods, but the recent air of frustration won\u2019t be cleared by yet another update that was long on grumbles about the \u201cuncertain environment\u201d, even though the company received the great gift of a lower pound. The effect of sterling\u2019s post-referendum fall was seen in tourism-driven strong sales in the UK. The chief problem this time was soggy sales in the US, which adds to a long line of previous grumbles about lack of Chinese visitors to Hong Kong and suchlike. Burberry doesn\u2019t seem to power through such upsets in the way that, say, French rival LVMH does. Christopher Bailey, chief creative officer, will be handing his chief executive\u2019s hat to Marco Gobbetti in July. Maybe the outsider can provide some fresh fizz to shares that fell 8% on Wednesday. Something new is required to keep the takeover rumours at bay.",
