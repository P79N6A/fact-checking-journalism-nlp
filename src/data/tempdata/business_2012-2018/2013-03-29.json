    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The radical shakeup of Britain's banking watchdog, which takes effect this weekend, is essential is to avoid another financial crisis, according to a top Bank of England official involved in implementing the new regime. Four years on from the crisis that threatened to bring down the UK's financial system, the coalition's dramatic overhaul of the City regulator will put Britain's central bank back in charge of financial stability. Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank, said Threadneedle Street had a \"historic mission\" to prevent another collapse. Labour's creation in 1997 of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) stripped it of that responsibility \u2013 but its return was a very good thing, he said. Overlooked for the top job at the Bank last year, Tucker also acknowledged that the new setup, which formally begins on Monday, could itself need reviewing in the future. Tucker told the Guardian that the institution was \"in the business of stability\", but also keen on recovery. \"You lose stability and the costs are enormous. This country learned the hard way about the inflationary boom and bust and now learned the hard way about banking boom and bust. It mustn't happen again.\" Putting the Bank back at the heart of oversight should help as \"separating banking supervision from the lender of last resort is hazardous unless you grow an umbilical cord that connects the two\". While banking supervision did not always need to be inside the central bank, communication was key, he said. \"I do think it's essential that the connection is really close, and supervision and central banking grew apart in this country and they're now being reconnected. Given where this country finds itself, that is a very good thing. It was always the historic mission of the Bank of England to look after stability.\" If the new system had been in place in 2006 \u2013 just before complex financial products turned so toxic that they locked up financial markets in a credit crunch \u2013 Tucker thinks regulators would have been \"worried by the resurgence in credit growth throughout the west from 2004\". It would also have worried about the ballooning market in credit default swaps and the booming securitisation industry. It would have intervened in wholesale markets and banks would have been required pump up their capital to make them safer in 2005 and 2006 \u2013 even then it might not have been enough to stop the crisis. \"I wouldn't go so far as to say it would have stopped the boom but it would have made the bust a lot less bad,\" said Tucker, who acknowledged that he helped to design the new system ripping apart the FSA, which shuts down on Sunday and puts the Bank of England back at the heart of ensuring the financial system is safe from speculative bubbles and spectacular busts. It means the blame for any future financial implosions can be placed firmly at the doors of the Bank, which during the 2008 crisis argued it had bark without bite, as blame was shuffled around between Threadneedle Street, the FSA and the Treasury \u2013 though some would argue that even the Bank's bark had been rather quiet. A new financial policy committee (FPC) is being formed inside the Bank \u2013 it is the body that this week caused controversy by ordering banks to plug a \u00a325bn capital shortfall. The Bank is also creating a new subsidiary, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), to regulate the big banks. Tucker sits on the FPC and the board of the PRA. Meanwhile, a new Financial Conduct Authority is being spun out of the FSA to regulate the behaviour of the City. Already though, the FPC, which has met on an interim basis since June 2011, has had a difficult birth. A reshuffle of its external members this week led some to wonder if its most outspoken members were being neutered. The requirement for banks to raise more capital saw the business secretary, Vince Cable, express concern about the impact on lending, while the smaller than expected size of the capital shortfall sparked speculation that the FPC had been leant on. The lack of detail about the requirements for each bank frustrated the City too. The FPC, borrowing the words of the former Federal Reserve banker William McChesney Martin, will be able to \"take the punch bowl away while the party is still going\". But Tucker admits it is hard to gauge whether attempts to impose sobriety on the system will be needed within five years or 20 years. And then, such a move might be very unpopular. \"Eventually there will be a moment when the bankers and the public are on the same side, opposing measures by the Bank of England, its financial policy committee, to slow the party down,\" said Tucker. \"The biggest problem with stability is people forgetting and taking stability for granted,\" he said. \"I think the most important thing about the FPC is an institutional structure that says these 11 men and women will not forget.\" The Bank has published 17 indicators that will be used to look for bubbles. While Tucker notes \"there is no indicator that will whisper the answer in our ear\", he cites a rapid growth in credit as one factor to watch closely. The PRA, led by Andrew Bailey, will be able to use its judgment about each individual bank, which should be \"fantastically rewarding\" for the regulators. Boards, too, will need to provide leadership in setting a new cultural tone. Nine months ago, when he was the frontrunner to replace Sir Mervyn King as governor, Tucker got caught up in the Libor-rigging scandal when exchanges between him and Barclays' then boss, Bob Diamond (who was forced to quit), became the subject of scrutiny. The appointment of the Bank of Canada chief Mark Carney as the next governor has led to speculation about the future of Tucker \u2013 whose five-year term as deputy governor for financial stability ends a year from now. Speaking in his parlour-like office at the Bank of England, he is keener to focus on regulation regime changes rather than discuss his past or future. Asked if he intended to stay on, Tucker replied: \"I am the deputy governor for financial stability. It's been the most extraordinary privilege being in this room while the system has been completely redesigned. \"Whether I like it or not, I've been one of the architects of the new system. I think it can serve this country well. \"No system is perfect and it will eventually be found wanting and we will need to keep it under review and improve it from time to time. But I think it's fit for purpose for now.\"",

The Communications Workers Union (CWU), which represents many of those walking out, said hundreds of jobs would be affected by the proposals, which it warned could cause further problems for high streets already struggling with shop closures. The union said staff had not received a pay rise for two years. The Post Office, which operates more than 11,500 sites in the UK \u2013 of which about 10,000 are franchised \u2013 said the plans to franchise further branches would benefit the long-term survival of the high street. \"There has been a lot of talk about the damage franchising will do to the high street, but in truth this is better for the high street,\" the Post Office said. \"This is about the long-term viability of that post office on that high street, which will be lost otherwise.\" The Post Office said crown branches were losing \u00a340m a year and accused the union of ignoring the harsh realities the company faced. Picket lines will be mounted outside the post offices, and customers will be urged to back the union's campaign. Dave Ward, the CWU's deputy general secretary, said: \"Our post office members are standing up against destructive plans which would slash 20% of the crown network and are simply asking for fair treatment and job security.\" Kevin Gilliland, network and sales director at the Post Office, said: \"We regret any disruption to services the CWU's call for strike action may cause to customers. Crown branches are currently losing \u00a340m per year and this is being subsidised by public money. This cannot continue.\" The Post Office said discussions were not yet under way over who would take on potential franchises, but since plans were announced this month there had been more than 100 expressions of interest.",

      "bodyText": "New rules that aim to put an end to banks and building societies mis-selling paid-for current accounts come into force this weekend. The changes come after the City watchdog said it feared some customers had been throwing money \"down the drain\" by paying monthly fees for accounts with add-ons such as travel or mobile phone insurance or car breakdown cover which later turn out to be useless to them. Nearly fifth of adults in the UK pay for their current accounts - but these packaged accounts have long been dogged by controversy. Some had questioned whether this area could become the next big bank mis-selling scandal when customers realise they've been paying for products they didn't need and have not used. \"These products are often referred to as upgraded accounts but if you end up paying for an element you can't claim on, it's money down the drain,\" said Financial Services Authority director of policy Sheila Nicoll. \"The new rules will make sure customers know what they're buying and that they can rely on the product or have the limitations explained before buying.\" From Sunday banks and building societies will be required to ascertain whether a customer is eligible to claim under each policy before they sell them such an account and will also have to send annual statements to existing customers, detailing whether they are still eligible to claim under the terms of the insurance policy for which they are paying. Financial institutions will also have to issue alerts to customers who have reached the age limit for their travel insurance \u2013 typically 65 \u2013 or who will reach that age before the next annual eligibility statement is due. The Financial Ombudsman Service receives about 60 complaints a week about packaged accounts and three-quarters of these are about the way that the policy was sold to them. The service said that many complaints centre around customers who try to make a claim on a travel insurance policy, only to find that they do not qualify due to their age or the type of holiday they have been on. Other complaints to the ombudsman are from people who did not even realise they had a packaged account and the charge has shown up on their statement in an unclear way as an \"administration fee\". Banks have been quick to compel people to open paid-for accounts in the last few years although more recently some have pulled out of the market. Santander scrapped sales of packaged accounts altogether last spring while Lloyds TSB recently temporarily halted packaged account sales in branches and over the phone at the end of last year \u2013 although customers can still sign up for them on the bank's website. \"This is a great parting shot from the FSA,\" said Michael Ossei, personal finance expert at uSwitch.com, commenting on the new rules. From Monday the FSA will be replaced by a the Financial Conduct Authority. \"For too long customers have been paying over the odds for bank accounts that offer benefits that they may not even qualify for. The new rules will bring some much-needed clarity to the packaged account market and may even force a shake-up within the industry.\" He added: \"Banks will now have to go through a proper process to ensure customers meet the strict criteria for an insurance policy before they can sign up. The lengthy procedure may push some banks into deciding against offering these policies in the future \u2013 it may no longer be worth their while.\"",
