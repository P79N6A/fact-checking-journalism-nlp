Sales of clothing fell 5.5% in the month, according to advisory firm BDO. Its monthly high street tracker measures the performance of 85 mid-sized chains such as Gap, French Connection and Hobbs. Poor fashion sales affected the high street as a whole, dragging underlying trading down by 4%, the worst monthly drop since September 2011 BDO said shoppers were staying away from the high street because there were less discounts around to tempt them. The trend was underlined by a tough week at John Lewis. Sales at the department store slumped 5% in the week to 28 March with fashion the hardest hit \u2013 down 11.6%. The retailer said performance was largely affected by comparison with the same week last year when John Lewis was price-matching a sales event at rival House of Fraser. BDO\u2019s figures are in sharp contrast to figures released by Marks &amp; Spencer on Thursday in which it said it had enjoyed a strong start to 2015. The retailer delivered its first quarterly rise in clothing underlying sales in more than four years, albeit by just 0.7%. \u201cSome consumers may have been delaying purchases until the extended bank holiday weekend this week when they will have more disposable time,\u201d BDO said. However, Easter is two weeks earlier this year than in 2014. The figures look particularly bad because they are set against a strong period of trading a year ago when retailers enjoyed the best performance for fouryears. Last March, much of the country was bathed in unseasonably balmy temperatures following floods in February. Even online sales growth was affected. While retailers rang up 17.6% more sales in March than last year, that was the lowest pace of growth since November 2011, when the economy was still suffering from the biggest recession since the 1930s.",

      "bodyText": "On the last full trading day before the break, stock markets had a cautious air about them. There was not much in the way of economic news - a slowdown in growth in UK construction, better than expected US weekly jobless claims - but there were plenty of other things to cause concern. A resolution to Greece\u2019s financial problems is still elusive as time runs out, the European Central Bank said it was concerned geopolitical risks could derail the recovery, and a nuclear deal with Iran was yet to be agreed. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 23.96 points or 0.35% higher at 6833.46 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.28% to 11,967.39 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.24% at 5074.14 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB slipped 0.22% to 23,308.53 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.55% at 11,634.0 The Athens market closed up 0.78% to 771.32 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 38 points or 0.21% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, as always. No blog tomorrow, but we\u2019ll be back next week. Over in Athens finance ministry officials are categorically denying any suggestion that Greek representatives said the country would run out of cash by April 9, reports Helena Smith: Denying reports citing European officials privy to Wednesday\u2019s Euro Working Group teleconference, Greek insiders insisted that cash-strapped Athens would be able to cover its \u20ac450m loan to the IMF on April 9. \u201cSuch reports undermine the European Union institutions and are simply not true,\u201d one official said. \u201cA deliberate rumour campaign is being waged against us.\u201d Officials also rejected reports that international creditors had advised the Greek government to continue dipping into pension funds and pther public assets to keep the debt-stricken economy afloat. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led coalition has been forced to make use of state finances - sequestering the funds of public corporations such as the Athens Metro and Greek Water Board - to cover government expenditure including salaries and pensions in recent weeks. Over in Italy: US markets are moving higher in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently up around 100 points after two days of decline. The rise follows better than expected weekly jobless figures, a day ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers. Reuters is reporting that Greece told creditors on a conference call on Wednesday that it would run out of cash on April 9: Greece has told its creditors it will run out of money on April 9, making an appeal for more loans before reforms on which new disbursements hinge are agreed and implemented, but the request was rejected, euro zone officials said. The appeal was made by Athens at a teleconference of euro zone deputy finance ministers on Wednesday organised to assess how far Athens still was from meeting the conditions for unlocking new financial aid. Greece\u2019s appeal echoed remarks by Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis on Wednesday that the country would have to choose whether to pay back \u20ac450m to the International Monetary Fund on April 9th or pay salaries and pensions. He said it would choose the latter. A government spokesman later denied that Greece would miss the IMF repayment deadline. But the choice Athens said it would face was repeated at the closed teleconference with creditors. Greece can get \u20ac7.2bn of new loans from the euro zone and the IMF if it imple\u20acments reforms that the previous government agreed would be the condition for disbursement. The new government does not want to implement most of these measures because they go against its election promises of ending budget consolidation policies. It is now negotiating a new list of steps that would keep both sides satisfied. The Greek representative on the call said that a deal on the reforms should not be a \u201cpost mortem\u201d for the country as \u201cthere is no way we can go beyond April 9th\u201d, euro zone officials said. He added that holding off with new loans until a deal with creditors can be reached was unrealistic. But others on the call, including Germany, reiterated that for Greece to get the reminder of the \u20ac240bn bailout, Athens would have to agree on the reforms and implement them and there was no chance of releasing the funds on April 9. Next week, Greece is due to make a debt payment to the IMF, which the country says it will not miss. But there is much more to come after that ..... The link to the full interview with Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann is here: \u201cTime is running out\u201d More from Weidmann: Don\u2019t you think that it would be wise to impose capital control measures now? The Greek government should stick to what has been agreed. That would be wise. But that is precisely what Greece isn\u2019t doing. That still remains to be seen. Otherwise, Greece will have to live with the consequences. And what are the consequences exactly? Bankruptcy and then being thrown out of the euro? It is looking ever more likely that Greece\u2019s solvency is no longer guaranteed. If a euro-area member state decides that it no longer intends to fulfil its obligations and ceases to make payments to its bondholders, then a disorderly insolvency is, indeed, inevitable. The economic and social repercussions for Greece would be severe and certainly not a desirable option. Now we are seeing an almost daily flow of messages from Athens, some calling for urgent help, others directing abuse at the helpers. Is there a strategy behind all this \u2013 or are they simply flying blind? That doesn\u2019t matter at the end of the day. What matters is less talk and more action. That would be a good strategy. Are you mainly referring to finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who has already given 40 interviews, including one focusing on his private life, during his short time in office? Generally speaking, I have found that what some of the members of the Greek government say changes from day to day and can also differ greatly depending on the audience. That does not exactly inspire confidence. Athens only has enough money in its treasury to last until April. Even if the government came around now, is there any chance at all of averting the disaster? The other countries\u2019 governments apparently have the impression a solution can still be reached and are therefore continuing with the discussions. But we do not have too much time left. Things are getting tight. ECB board member and president of the Bundesbank Jens Weidmann has warned that time is running out for Greece, but says it is up to politicians not the central bank to decide who is in the eurozone. Here\u2019s part of his interview, published in Focus on 28 March and just up on the Bundesbank website: Mr Weidmann, have you ever actually asked your colleague Yannis Stournaras, the Greek central bank governor, whether he has already started printing Greek drachma? No. On the ECB Governing Council we discuss how we are going to keep our single currency stable and not how we are going to get out of it. But surely preparations must already be underway for Greece\u2019s exit from the euro. And Greece will above all need a new currency. A Grexit is becoming an increasing likely scenario after all. The media\u2019s focus on a Grexit diverts attention from what really counts, namely that the Greek government implements the negotiated reform agreements. The implementation of these reforms is after all a precondition for financial assistance. Greece will then be able to enjoy economic success again. It sounds like you still have a flicker of hope, and yet Yanis Varoufakis himself has said: \u201cI am the finance minister of a bankrupt country.\u201d Up until the final quarter of last year there were indeed signs of an improvement, but the new government has frittered away a lot of trust. And yes: it is evident that Greece is currently cut off from the capital markets and that it is unable to meet its funding needs without external help. And you\u2019re telling me there is no plan B in place for the event that Greece stumbles out of the euro? It is ultimately politicians, not the central bank, who decide who\u2019s in the currency union and who isn\u2019t. Even though many people would like to offload this responsibility on central banks, it is not up to us. Similarly, the central banks are not responsible for deciding whether a country should receive financial assistance or how a country that doesn\u2019t meet the requirements to be granted assistance should be treated. Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, is currently speaking at a community development research conference. Live feed is here. Good news on the US job front ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. Weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fell 20,000 to 268,000 last week, down from a revised 288,000 the previous week (the original data showed 282,000 claims) and better than the forecast figure of 285,000. Oil has lost its early gains and is now sharply lower on the prospect that nuclear talks with Iran - although dragging on - might ultimately be successful. A deal would release extra crude oil onto the markets where there is already oversupply, and falling demand. Analyst Eugene Weinberg at Commerzbank told Reuters: Investors seem to have taken the view that there will be a deal and the market is already oversupplied. Brent crude is currently off 2.5% at $55.67 a barrel. The European Central Bank is worried that the eurozone recovery is more fragile than thought. The minutes of last month\u2019s meeting, just released, show that policymakers still worry that risks to the euro area economic outlook remain to the downside. The ECB\u2019s own staff economists had raised their growth forecasts before the meeting. But some national bank governors may not be convinced. They\u2019re fretting about geopolitical problems within the euro (Greece), and outside (Middle East, Ukraine...) and also worrying that politicians will fail to reform their economies. Here\u2019s the key section: The downside risks to growth were seen as stemming from geopolitical and political risks inside and outside the euro area. The possibility of weaker than expected investment growth was also considered to be a downside risk. In addition, it was remarked that the materialisation of the baseline scenario depended on a number of assumptions \u2013 including the closure of the output gap, a recovery in investment growth, the strengthening of corporate pricing power and a significant pass-through of the fall in oil prices to spending \u2013 each of which might be seen as being associated with some downside risks. The question was posed as to whether the strong rebound in the economy, in part also as a result of monetary policy measures, was fully consistent with the underlying financial market assumptions, since expectations of a pronounced recovery in growth appeared not to square easily with interest rates and monetary conditions remaining very accommodative far into the future. At the same time, it could also be argued that, while a constant level of the exchange rate was embedded in the technical assumptions, a further weakening would affect other variables such as export growth and investment activity. The risk of insufficient progress on structural reforms was also highlighted as a major downside risk. In that context, the argument was advanced that the projected pick-up in growth could weaken incentives for governments to pursue the necessary structural reforms and thereby adversely affect potential growth. More here: Account of the monetary policy meeting And here\u2019s some reaction: Here\u2019s another handy reminder of the many funding hurdles facing Greece..... Readers looking for a better grasp of the crisis may enjoy this video: It\u2019s a full interview with Yanis Varoufakis, conducted by German journalist Harald Schumann last summer as he roamed Europe trying to understand recent events in the eurozone. Although it took place before Varoufakis entered government in January, it\u2019s a great insight into his view of the crisis, and the failure of austerity. For example, when he touches on \u201cone of the greatest scandals of the banking sectors of Europe...the Greek recapitalisation process\u201d. It is either complicity, or idiocy..... and as I believe the people who represented the Troika in Athens are very smart folks I tend to come down on the side of complicity. The bailout loan of 2010, he adds, was simply a \u201ccynical transfer\u201d of banking losses from the banks\u2019 books to the shoulders of the taxpayers; first Greek taxpayers, but eventually the rest of Europe too. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s visit to Moscow on April 8 has raised concerns that Greece is cuddling up to Russia to force its European creditors to offer more help. Officially, the visit is billed as a chance to build bridges: ....but some policymakers fear Greece will undermine Europe\u2019s hard line on sanctions imposed to try to end the bloodshed and conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Over in the Telegraph, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard argues that Athens cannot be blamed for looking elsewhere for help, given its treatment under the debt crisis. Here\u2019s a flavour: Leaked IMF minutes from 2010 confirm what Syriza has always argued: the country was already bankrupt and needed debt relief rather than new loans. This was overruled in order to save the euro and to save Europe\u2019s banking system at a time when EMU had no defences against contagion. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis rightly calls it \u201ca cynical transfer of private losses from the banks\u2019 books onto the shoulders of Greece\u2019s most vulnerable citizens\u201d. A small fraction of the \u20ac240bn of loans remained in the Greek economy. Some 90% was rotated back to banks and financial creditors. The damage was compounded by austerity overkill. The economy contracted so violently that the debt-ratio rocketed instead of coming down, defeating the purpose. India\u2019s member on the IMF board warned that such policies could not work without offsetting monetary stimulus. \u201cEven if, arguably, the programme is successfully implemented, it could trigger a deflationary spiral of falling prices, falling employment and falling fiscal revenues that could eventually undermine the programme itself.\u201d He was right in every detail. More here: Greek defiance mounts as Alexis Tsipras turns to Russia and China Economists at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch point out that any Greek default would probably occur in May, if it finds itself unable to meet various repayments due this month: Over in Athens officials say they are flummoxed as to how the government\u2019s proposed reform programme was leaked to the press. Helena Smith reports from Athens: \u201cThe leak did not happen through the Greek government,\u201d Gavriel Sakellarides told Mega TV this morning. \u201cI don\u2019t know who put it out, but in no way is this leak through the government. \u201c Remember, though, that Greek officials, exasperated with what they believe to be deliberate obstructiveness by EU/IMF negotiators, had privately threatened to release the full reform plan to prove that the finance ministry had proposed constructive structural reforms \u2013 and not the vague proposals that it is so often accused of. HS The 26-page reform plan is indeed more detailed than previous documents; many measures have clear, sourced revenue projections to raise up to \u20ac6bn. For example: But still not detailed enough.... Greece\u2019s prime minister has been pressing on with tackling the country\u2019s humanitarian crisis. Alexis Tsipras told an audience at the health ministry that his government would restructuring the country\u2019s ailing healthcare system. He pledged to hire 4,500 more healthcare workers, and to reverse the \u201ccommercialization of healthcare\u201d under the previous government. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Helena Smith\u2019s take on last night\u2019s (leaked) reform list: Over in the Athens parliament, Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has hit out at yesterday\u2019s leaking of his 26-page reform plan. Varoufakis told MPs that the disclosure was not acceptable, and blamed Greece\u2019s creditors for passing the information to the Financial Times. \u201cThis is not our choice, we must ensure confidentiality\u201d, he told MPs. Varoufakis agreed that the reforms should have been announced to parliament. According to the Kathimerini newspaper, he said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the Greek people to obtain information from websites [so don\u2019t click here, readers]. Varoufakis is particularly irked that Brussels has been pushing for confidentiality in the first place. Heard the one about the bishop, the baroness and the union chief? They\u2019ve all agreed to join a new body to keep Britain\u2019s banking sector on the straight-and-narrow. This chart, via the FT, shows how Greek two-year bond yields have fluctuated wildly in recent months --&gt; The general upward trend, though, shows that investors have been pricing in a higher risk of default or restucturing. Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have soared by 5% to a seven year high, as traders welcome the long-awaited turnaround in clothes sales. There\u2019s grudging praise from some quarters, though: Extra Easter eggs for Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s staff, after it *finally* reported a rise in clothes sales in four years. The high street retailer grew clothing and household sales by 0.7% in the last quarter, suggesting it has got its online operations under control. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The rise in sales comes despite a tricky spring for fashion retailers with the weather much chillier than this time last year. The company credited improvements in style and quality, and positive press coverage, particularly of a suede skirt which has yet to arrive in stores, for the sales turnaround. But performance was also lifted by a return to growth at M&amp;S.com, where sales rose 13.8%, a considerable bounce from the 6% slump over Christmas, when business was affected by problems at the group\u2019s hi-tech distribution centre in Castle Donington. Just in: Growth in Britain\u2019s construction sector slowed last month as builders wait for next month\u2019s general election to play out. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit. Its UK construction PMI fell to 57.8 last month, down from 60.15 in February -- so still comfortably above the 50-point mark showing no change. Civil engineering saw the biggest slowdown. Markit says: Some construction firms noted that uncertainty related to the forthcoming general election had encouraged clients to delay spending decisions. The latest survey pointed to an element of caution among construction companies in terms of additional job hiring, with overall employment numbers rising at the least marked pace since December 2013. Encouragingly, confidence about the next 12 months hit a nine-year high (so they can\u2019t be THAT worried about the election...). Have City traders already bunked off for Easter? Europe\u2019s stock markets are moribund this morning, with the main indices either up a bit or down a bit ahead of the bank holidays. Most investors are taking a wait-and-see approach to Greece. They\u2019re more concerned about tomorrow\u2019s US unemployment data, which could be disappointing (yesterday\u2019s measure of private sector job creation missed forecasts.) Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, explains: There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty still hanging over the market and with events including the US non farm payrolls and a meeting between Tsipras and Putin - which has the potential to see more political grandstanding from Greece \u2013 set to occur [on April 8th], there\u2019s going to be a degree of risk mitigation in play. Former European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso has laid into the new Greek government this morning. Ex-Maoist Barroso didn\u2019t show much sympathy for Greece\u2019s leftist administration, accusing it of inexperience. Interviewed by the BBC, Barroso said Athens\u2019 demands were \u201ccompletely unacceptable to other countries\u201d. \u201cIt is not helpful if Greece attacks countries that are trying to help it.\u201d \u201cWe should remember that there are poorer countries that are lending money to Greece, so to propose a cut to their debt would be certain to receive a no from their partners.\u201d Barroso also denied that the EU had created the structural problems and low productivity in Greece. But we should remember that Barroso was at the helm in 2010, when Greece\u2019s first, flawed bailout was put together. Greek sovereign debt is weakening this morning as traders fret about the state of its finances. This has driven the yield on two-year bonds up to 23.27%, up from 22.99% last night. [yields rise when prices fall]. And here\u2019s the quote from French finance minister Sapin: \u201cThere is progress with the last [Greek reform] list ... Is there a need for more progress? Yes - in the quantification of the measures.\u201d Newsflash from France: French finance minister Michel Sapin has warned that Greece\u2019s economic reform plan still needs more detail: FRENCH FINMIN SAYS PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WITH LATEST GREEK REFORM LIST, MORE PROGRESS MUST BE MADE, MORE DETAILS NEEDED With political tensions rising in Greece, the previous prime minister has suggested he could form an alliance to avoid the country leaving the euro. Antonis Samaras, who was defeated in January\u2019s general election, told Bloomberg that he\u2019d be prepared to work with Alexis Tsipras if the governing Syriza party splits up. \u201cIf the plan is to keep Greece in the euro area, we will provide support....Exit would signal a total catastrophe.\u201d There\u2019s no sign that Syriza is about to splinter, but its left-wing elements may find it impossible to support measures which they campaigned against. Privatisations might be a red line, for example, as could labour market reform (an area where the eurozone wants more action). Samaras also pushed Tsipras to cut the rhetoric, and accept the agreement made in February. Otherwise, he warned, Greece could default. \u201cI see a lot of words, a lot of theory, a lot of lies, and no action...All of these add up to a big question mark.\u201d \u201cIf they ideologically decide they won\u2019t abide by this agreement, then you may have a default.\u201d. It\u2019s hard to see Tsipras and Samaras in the same administration, given their clear antipathy. But desperate times and all that.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re heading into the Easter break without any signs of a deal to unlock some bailout cash for Greece, despite some encouraging signs on Wednesday. Yesterday the Greek finance ministry submitted its most detailed economic reform plan yet; 26-pages of tax measures, administrative reforms and privatisations. Greece also warned its eurozone partners that the very viability of the EU was at stake, saying: The Hellenic Republic considers itself to be a proud and indefeasible member of the European Union and an irrevocable member of the Eurozone. Yet the viability of that Union, and especially of the common currency, is now in question, in the minds of many Greek citizens as it is in the minds of many among our European partners. The question before us all, as Europeans, is whether the European Union can rise to the challenge before it..... (last night\u2019s liveblog has the details..... and the FT has the full list) But a stream of eurozone insider have warned that Greece has still not convinced its creditors. The Wall Street Journal reports: The list is a \u201cvery long way from being a basis [for a deal],\u201d a eurozone official said. \u201cThey should negotiate in competence and good faith with the institutions first, and then we will see.\u201d Another official warned: \u201cIt still lacks detail and substance in many places.\u201d And with the Western Easter break starting tomorrow, and Orthodox Easter a week later, the negotiations look bogged down. Eurozone finance chiefs may not decide whether Greece has done enough until their next scheduled meeting in three week\u2019s time. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it: A great deal of scepticism remains about the prospect of any type of deal before the next EU finance ministers meeting on April 24th, which given that Greece needs to make various payments of nearly \u20ac2.5bn, between now and then, doesn\u2019t bode well for any sort of resolution this week, or next week, for that matter. Overshadowing everything, of course, is the \u20ac430m due to the IMF next Thursday. Athens insists that it will meet it. But yesterday\u2019s warning from interior minister Nikos Voutsis that the payment could be delayed has raised the pressure. So, it could be a quieter day... or perhaps not. Either way, we\u2019ll be covering the main events through the day...",

And Greece will above all need a new currency. A Grexit is becoming an increasing likely scenario after all.</strong> </p> <p>The media\u2019s focus on a Grexit diverts attention from what really counts, namely that the Greek government implements the negotiated reform agreements. The implementation of these reforms is after all a precondition for financial assistance.

Even though many people would like to offload this responsibility on central banks, it is not up to us. Similarly, the central banks are not responsible for deciding whether a country should receive financial assistance or how a country that doesn\u2019t meet the requirements to be granted assistance should be treated. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-04-02T13:30:15.828Z\">at 2.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-551d3b74e4b08caf50c1eaa9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-02T13:16:29.905Z\">2.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, is currently speaking at a community development research conference. </strong></p> <p>Live feed is<a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/federalreserve\"><strong> here.</strong></a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-551d39a9e4b0b3f858ca66fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-02T12:47:21.688Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good news on the US job front ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers.</strong></p> <p>Weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fell 20,000 to 268,000 last week, down from a revised 288,000 the previous week (the original data showed 282,000 claims) and better than the forecast figure of 285,000.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-551d3462e4b0e961ee185614\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-02T12:42:33.819Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oil has lost its early gains and is now sharply lower on the prospect that nuclear talks with Iran - although dragging on - might ultimately be successful.</strong></p> <p>A deal would release extra crude oil onto the markets where there is already oversupply, and falling demand.</p> <p>Analyst Eugene Weinberg at Commerzbank told Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors seem to have taken the view that there will be a deal and the market is already oversupplied.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brent crude is currently off 2.5% at $55.67 a barrel.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-04-02T12:54:41.938Z\">at 1.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-551d2d33e4b0e961ee18560c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-02T12:12:49.032Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB fears geopolitical risks could derail recovery</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"549d0d414a877a9891cd2a8a59f211bce00bbf74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/549d0d414a877a9891cd2a8a59f211bce00bbf74/0_0_3801_5704/666.jpg\" alt=\"ECB HQ\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The European Central Bank is worried that the eurozone recovery is more fragile than thought. </strong></p> <p>The minutes of last month\u2019s meeting, just released, show that policymakers still worry that risks to the euro area economic outlook remain to the downside. </p> <p>The ECB\u2019s own staff economists had raised their growth forecasts before the meeting. But some national bank governors may not be convinced. </p> <p>They\u2019re fretting about geopolitical problems within the euro (<em>Greece</em>), and outside (<em>Middle East, Ukraine...</em>) and also worrying that politicians will fail to reform their economies.</p> <p><strong>Here\u2019s the key section:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The downside risks to growth were seen as stemming from geopolitical and political risks inside and outside the euro area. The possibility of weaker than expected investment growth was also considered to be a downside risk. In addition, it was remarked that the materialisation of the baseline scenario depended on a number of assumptions \u2013 including the closure of the output gap, a recovery in investment growth, the strengthening of corporate pricing power and a significant pass-through of the fall in oil prices to spending \u2013 each of which might be seen as being associated with some downside risks. The question was posed as to whether the strong rebound in the economy, in part also as a result of monetary policy measures, was fully consistent with the underlying financial market assumptions, since expectations of a pronounced recovery in growth appeared not to square easily with interest rates and monetary conditions remaining very accommodative far into the future. At the same time, it could also be argued that, while a constant level of the exchange rate was embedded in the technical assumptions, a further weakening would affect other variables such as export growth and investment activity.<br></p> <p>The risk of insufficient progress on structural reforms was also highlighted as a major downside risk. In that context, the argument was advanced that the projected pick-up in growth could weaken incentives for governments to pursue the necessary structural reforms and thereby adversely affect potential growth. </p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2015/html/mg150402.en.html\">Account of the monetary policy meeting</a></h2> <p>And here\u2019s some reaction:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mdbaccardax/statuses/583592606564777984\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB &quot;Minutes&quot; confirm GC commitment to QE through Sept 2016 ... sees some uncertainty in Staff economic projections ...</p>&mdash; Martin Baccardax (@mdbaccardax) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mdbaccardax/status/583592606564777984\">April 2, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/fwred/statuses/583594811199979521\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Shorter ECB accounts: cautiously optimistic about QE effect; no change to QE modalities for now, but (vague) flexbility retained.</p>&mdash; Frederik Ducrozet (@fwred) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fwred/status/583594811199979521\">April 2, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-551d3168e4b0b3f858ca66ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-02T12:09:16.459Z\">1.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kitjuckes/statuses/583598919160045568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>&quot;When planning to kick a can down the path, you must first go to the wire&quot;.

The bang-on-trend 1970s-style suede skirt is due to go on sale on 10 April, but only in the chain\u2019s top 100 stores, and with a very un-M&amp;S price tag of \u00a3199. Nevertheless, some 3,500 potential buyers have already put their names on a waiting list for the skirt and the chances are it will be sold out and on eBay at a premium price shortly after it first appears on the M&amp;S rails. The furore around the skirt will be regarded as a major success for the M&amp;S marketing department, which is aiming to burnish the chain\u2019s fashion credentials and cool factor. They aim to turn one or two key items into objects of desire in the hope that shoppers will go into the stores and online and discover other items too. The buzz around the suede skirt started back in February, when two celebrity fashionistas \u2013 the TV presenter Alexa Chung and Olivia Palermo, an American socialite \u2013 were photographed wearing the unobtainable skirt. The fashion bible Vogue then passed judgment, calling it \u201ca brilliant bit of Ali MacGraw styling\u201d . \u201cIt\u2019s been great for the brand,\u201d said Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer. Indeed, such has been the excitement ahead of the skirt\u2019s launch that the store produced a copycat faux-suede version, which has already sold out online. Acclaim from the fashion press can, however, be a double-edged sword. In 2013, M&amp;S produced a highly sought-after \u00a385 pink duster coat that closely echoed catwalk trends and, like the skirt, swiftly became the talk of the fashion press. The retailer was then criticised for running out of stock too quickly and not making the hot item available in sufficient stores. On the day of launch, the coat flew off the rails of the Marble Arch flagship store and there was an immediate list of 100 customers waiting for new stock to arrive. M&amp;S\u2019s website also struggled to cope with demand from fashion fans, while the coat started appearing on eBay for twice the price. That autumn, M&amp;S admitted that sales had been hit as it had failed to buy enough stock of its fashion hits. Can M&amp;S get it right with the suede skirt? The retailer is not revealing how many of them it has bought in, but it is only going to be stocked in one in eight of its stores. So if your local outlet is not one of the chain\u2019s top branches and you really want to pay \u00a3199 to look like a 1970s cowgirl this spring, it may be wise to start preparing your tactics now.",

The outcome is expected to be communicated \u2018in the next few weeks\u2019. This suggests to us that Tate might be contemplating advising the market ahead of the prelims on 28 May. We have argued, consistently, that Tate\u2019s choices in Sucralose are, pace Jack Welch, to \u2018fix\u2019, \u2018close\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019 the business.</p> <p>\u2018Close\u2019 not attractive? Total closure of both plants would incur one-off costs in excess of \u00a3100m (based on what was provided for the closure of McIntosh in 2009). This continues to look unattractive to us, relative to the alternatives.</p> <p>\u2018Sell\u2019 a realistic option, even now? We think Tate might find a buyer for the assets, despite eroding profits. We note that Monsanto sold NutraSweet (Aspartame) to private equity in 2000 for $440m, nearly two times sales and eight years after the price collapsed on generic entry. Applying a similar multiple to Sucralose now implies a value of \u00a3250m to \u00a3300m.</p> <p>But we think Tate would want to think carefully about the broader consequences of an exit from what remains the world\u2019s top-selling sweetener.</p> <p>\u2018Fix\u2019 preferred for us. Even at a price $60-$70 per kilo, we think Sucralose is making a strong factory-level contribution. We think that a more focused approach could put Sucralose back on a path to modest but sustainable profitability and keep Tate in the broader sweeteners game. In this context, we see the recent decision to hike list prices by 20% as a signal that Tate is either trying to restore order on pricing (responding to positive signals from leading Chinese player JK Sucralose) or alternatively is contemplating a lower volume/higher price niche strategy, supported by single plant manufacturing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tate ended 18p better at 626p.<br></p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 23.96 points higher at 6833.46, despite a slowdown in UK construction growth and continuing concerns about the financial situation in Greece. In the US there were better than expected weekly jobless claims figures, ahead of Friday\u2019s key non-farm payroll numbers.</p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> jumped more than 4% to 554p after it reported better than expected clothing sales, but mining shares came under pressure as iron ore fell below $50 a tonne for the first time in more than a decade. </p> <p>Miners were weaker as iron ore hit new lows. iron ore prices fell below $50 a tonne for the first time in more than a decade. Analysts at Davy said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Iron ore benchmark and premium prices are down 60% and 54% year-on-year respectively, with benchmark prices breaching the psychological barrier of $50 per tonne. Despite signs of stabilization emerging from the Chinese property market, overcapacity in the country\u2019s steel industry and the onslaught of global iron ore supply growth are keeping sentiment firmly in bearish territory.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>BHP Billiton</strong> lost 38.5p to 1431.5p while <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> dipped 11p to \u00a327.51 ahead of next week\u2019s expiry of the bar on <strong>Glencore</strong>, down 3.35p at 280.75p, mounting a new takeover offer. Analysts at Investec said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We remain of the view that Rio shareholders would not support a Glencore bid, although as [Rio chief executive] Sam Walsh points out, it does all come down to value. The Rio price has in recent months been relatively weaker, but it remains amazingly resilient against a collapsing iron ore price. Ironically, the Rio price is probably being supported to some extent by the threat of a Glencore bid. </p> </blockquote> <p>Oil slid back on signs of a nuclear deal with Iran, which would see crude from the country flood onto an already oversupplied market. Brent fell 2.7% to $55.54 a barrel and <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> A shares slipped 6.5p to 20.24.5p but <strong>BP</strong> shrugged off the concerns, up 0.75p at 442.85p.<br></p> <p>Finally Aim-listed <strong>Koovs</strong>, an ecommerce fashion business focused on India, fell 43% to 66.5p despite forecasts of a tripling of full year sales, as it said marketing costs were higher than expected and were likely to continue in that vein.</p> <p>It also said it would be seeking further funding in due course to \u201caccelerate development.\u201d</p>",

We have argued, consistently, that Tate\u2019s choices in Sucralose are, pace Jack Welch, to \u2018fix\u2019, \u2018close\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019 the business. \u2018Close\u2019 not attractive? Total closure of both plants would incur one-off costs in excess of \u00a3100m (based on what was provided for the closure of McIntosh in 2009). This continues to look unattractive to us, relative to the alternatives. \u2018Sell\u2019 a realistic option, even now? We think Tate might find a buyer for the assets, despite eroding profits. We note that Monsanto sold NutraSweet (Aspartame) to private equity in 2000 for $440m, nearly two times sales and eight years after the price collapsed on generic entry. Applying a similar multiple to Sucralose now implies a value of \u00a3250m to \u00a3300m. But we think Tate would want to think carefully about the broader consequences of an exit from what remains the world\u2019s top-selling sweetener. \u2018Fix\u2019 preferred for us. Even at a price $60-$70 per kilo, we think Sucralose is making a strong factory-level contribution. We think that a more focused approach could put Sucralose back on a path to modest but sustainable profitability and keep Tate in the broader sweeteners game. In this context, we see the recent decision to hike list prices by 20% as a signal that Tate is either trying to restore order on pricing (responding to positive signals from leading Chinese player JK Sucralose) or alternatively is contemplating a lower volume/higher price niche strategy, supported by single plant manufacturing. Tate ended 18p better at 626p. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 23.96 points higher at 6833.46, despite a slowdown in UK construction growth and continuing concerns about the financial situation in Greece. In the US there were better than expected weekly jobless claims figures, ahead of Friday\u2019s key non-farm payroll numbers. Marks &amp; Spencer jumped more than 4% to 554p after it reported better than expected clothing sales, but mining shares came under pressure as iron ore fell below $50 a tonne for the first time in more than a decade. Miners were weaker as iron ore hit new lows. iron ore prices fell below $50 a tonne for the first time in more than a decade. Analysts at Davy said: Iron ore benchmark and premium prices are down 60% and 54% year-on-year respectively, with benchmark prices breaching the psychological barrier of $50 per tonne. Despite signs of stabilization emerging from the Chinese property market, overcapacity in the country\u2019s steel industry and the onslaught of global iron ore supply growth are keeping sentiment firmly in bearish territory. BHP Billiton lost 38.5p to 1431.5p while Rio Tinto dipped 11p to \u00a327.51 ahead of next week\u2019s expiry of the bar on Glencore, down 3.35p at 280.75p, mounting a new takeover offer. Analysts at Investec said: We remain of the view that Rio shareholders would not support a Glencore bid, although as [Rio chief executive] Sam Walsh points out, it does all come down to value. The Rio price has in recent months been relatively weaker, but it remains amazingly resilient against a collapsing iron ore price. Ironically, the Rio price is probably being supported to some extent by the threat of a Glencore bid. Oil slid back on signs of a nuclear deal with Iran, which would see crude from the country flood onto an already oversupplied market. Brent fell 2.7% to $55.54 a barrel and Royal Dutch Shell A shares slipped 6.5p to 20.24.5p but BP shrugged off the concerns, up 0.75p at 442.85p. Finally Aim-listed Koovs, an ecommerce fashion business focused on India, fell 43% to 66.5p despite forecasts of a tripling of full year sales, as it said marketing costs were higher than expected and were likely to continue in that vein. It also said it would be seeking further funding in due course to \u201caccelerate development.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s face it, even the idea that corporations might use their financial clout in a progressive matter is, for most observers, enough to trigger a severe attack of cognitive dissonance. If anything, we\u2019re accustomed to seeing the reverse. At their worst, the world\u2019s giant energy producers simply reject the idea that climate change is taking place. More subtly, critics charge, others like Shell suggest that the benefits of providing the world\u2019s poor with cheap energy offset some of the risks posed to those same individuals by climate change. But then, what else is to be expected from big businesses that earn giant profits by finding and extracting fossil fuels and then persuading people to use them? Meanwhile, big banks are trying to roll back all the reforms set in place in the months and years that followed the financial crisis, chipping away at the ability to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act, among other initiatives. So Apple, under Tim Cook\u2019s leadership, looks even more unusual in its newfound social activism. During a trip to Israel in late February, Cook \u2013 who came out as gay late last year \u2013 paid a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum. He wrote in its guestbook that he pledged \u201cto be ever watchful for those who would threaten human rights and equality\u201d. Cook is living up to that pledge. As CEO of the country\u2019s largest corporation, which has a market capitalization of $724bn, he has a massive bully pulpit. And he\u2019s using it to take on Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana. Late last month, Pence signed into law a religious freedom bill that critics said gave companies the freedom to discriminate against the LGBT community. In the face of immediate and intense criticism, Pence insisted he and the bill have simply been misunderstood \u2013 although he also said he was not willing to consider extending civil rights protection to LGBT individuals. Cook said, bluntly, that it was all balderdash. In a crisply written and pointed essay published in the Washington Post, he described himself as a person of faith \u2013 and went on to say that he was never taught religion should be used to discriminate. Moreover, he wrote, having grown up in the south in the 1960s and 1970s, he knew how tough it was to fight institutionalized discrimination. Apple\u2019s message, he said, was that \u201cregardless of what the law may allow in Indiana ... we will never allow discrimination\u201d. Cook hinted that he would not stop at words, however eloquent. After all, as that old playground taunt has it, words wouldn\u2019t hurt Pence. Actions would. And steps taken by a handful of other corporate leaders gave us a hint of what might be in the offing. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com, announced that he was canceling any programs in Indiana. That was not an idle threat: the company is the state\u2019s largest technology employer, and a corporate event brought in as much as $9m in revenue for Indianapolis last year, according to some reports. Angie\u2019s List halted work on its Indianapolis headquarters, a $40m project. Jeremy Stoppelman, the CEO of Yelp, wrote an open letter to the governors of states considering following Indiana\u2019s lead, pointedly declaring that the company would \u201cmake every effort to expand its corporate presence only in states that do not have these laws allowing for discrimination on the books\u201d. A number of other Fortune 500 names \u2013 Eli Lilly, Gap, American Airlines \u2013 openly protested Indiana\u2019s legislation. Opposition to such bills attracted support from more unexpected quarters. Walmart\u2019s CEO asked Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson to veto a similar bill, arguing it did not reflect the values \u201cwe proudly uphold\u201d. Hutchinson buckled, saying he would not sign the bill. Even Nascar \u2013 a favorite recreational pastime for the kind of folks you might think would be likely to look askance at something as unusual as same-sex marriage \u2013 insisted it welcomed all competitors and fans to its events in Indiana. And the concerted wave of social activism worked, putting Pence on the defensive. On Thursday, Republicans in the Indiana state legislature said they had amended the bill to make sure businesses could not discriminate against people. The move was said to have Pence\u2019s support. Part of this may simply have been due to sheer surprise: who would have imagined that so many giant corporations would have been ready to speak out so bluntly? But this is where having large, costly and talented corporate communications teams really pays off. If you look at their statements, none of these businesses are speaking out in favor of same-sex marriage. If they did so, they\u2019d probably alienate a chunk of their customer base. What they are saying is something that it\u2019s almost impossible to quarrel with. They are waving the flag of equality, of tolerance, of fairness, of diversity, of opportunity. All of which are as American as the much-touted motherhood and apple pie. Moreover, in contrast to Starbucks\u2019 painfully bungled attempt to engage in social activism over the tricky topic of race, these companies have handled the issue properly. Whereas Howard Schultz, the coffee chain\u2019s founder and CEO, handed off the task of trying to start a dialog over race issues in America with bleary-eyed commuters to Starbucks baristas, in the case of the \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws the message is coming straight from the CEO\u2019s office. It\u2019s also a message that is clear and crisp \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t discriminate!\u201d \u2013 and not fuzzy \u2013 \u201cPlease, talk about race\u201d. That\u2019s bound to have a much bigger impact. Still, if you interpret this explosion of outrage as signifying that corporations are suddenly going to join the ranks of progressive social activists across the board, you might want to rein in your hopes. For them, these laws are simply bad business, as Cook himself pointed out: America\u2019s business community recognized a long time ago that discrimination, in all its forms, is bad for business. Today, with same-sex marriage legal in three dozen states \u2013 Indiana among them \u2013 compared to only a handful a few years ago, the idea that a business would stay silent while a portion of its employees or affluent customer base faced the prospect of discrimination under a newly passed law would simply be counterintuitive. Why would Apple not speak out, clearly and forcefully, when its CEO \u2013 the guy who runs the largest corporation in the country, let\u2019s not forget \u2013 might walk into a restaurant in Indiana and be denied service? Expecting any of these companies to suddenly start advocating on issues from paying a living wage to the elimination of the wealth gap is simply too much to hope for. Apple isn\u2019t suddenly going to decide to repatriate its staggering $178bn cash mountain and altruistically donate billions of that to the US treasury in the form of taxes. (Though it might be nice if this new anti-discrimination campaign could be extended, and channeled into a more effective debate on race than the one that Starbucks tried to launch.) For now, we may want to be pleased that for once, what is in the best interests of corporate America also happens to be in the interest of many of its citizens \u2013 including many in Indiana itself.",

      "bodyText": "A senior HSBC executive has privately admitted that the bank is \u201ccast-iron certain\u201d to have another major regulatory breach in the future, and is struggling on multiple fronts to clean up its worldwide operations. Global head of sanctions Lee Hale \u2013 whose recorded comments appear to contrast with public statements from HSBC\u2019s chief executive that the bank has fundamentally transformed itself after recent scandals \u2013 said gaps remained in the bank\u2019s compliance with sanctions policies and the screening of certain financial transactions. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC\u2019s chief executive since 2011, and Rona Fairhead, chair of HSBC North America as well as the BBC Trust, have repeatedly assured the UK parliament that the bank today is markedly different from when its Swiss branch facilitated large-scale tax evasion, or when its Mexican branch was found by US authorities to be complicit in multimillion-dollar money-laundering for drug cartels. \u201cIn terms of actually tightening HSBC, making it a simpler business, making it a business that actually follows the highest standards of money-laundering controls, knowing our customers and tax transparency, substantial root-and-branch reforms have taken place,\u201d Gulliver told the Commons public accounts committee in February. But an audio recording, heard by the Guardian, of a confidential meeting held in the last three months reveals that Lee Hale set out a much more complex picture of the bank\u2019s progress in bringing its procedures into line with what authorities expect. In a statement, HSBC said it did not recognise the comments in the recording, which it said had been taken out of context. The bank said it was unable to provide specific examples of inaccuracies by the time of publication.

The deferred prosecution agreement was signed by the then US attorney for the eastern district of New York, Loretta Lynch, who is now Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for US attorney general. During the meeting, which lasted several hours, Hale set out the bank\u2019s achievements in updating its compliance procedures and strengthening its reporting and its financial controls in a number of different areas of its global operations. He told the monitors that the bank\u2019s size made large-scale breaches a virtual inevitability, and said he was not yet \u201ccomfortable\u201d with compliance in some significant areas of its operations. During a long exchange about HSBC\u2019s new policy on sanctions and internal breaches of company rules, Hale told the regulator that \u201cgiven the size and scale of HSBC\u201d, in his view \u201cit is a cast-iron certain[ty] this will happen, at some point in the future we\u2019re going to have some big breach, some regulatory breach\u201d. He added: \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t happen, but it is likely.\u201d Under pressure from regulators and investors alike, Gulliver has repeatedly insisted HSBC is not too big to manage. The pressure was heightened by the revelations of wrongdoing at its Swiss private bank, published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the Guardian, Le Monde and others. Gulliver says he has greatly tightened internal management at the bank, dropping its previous federation structure, in which each country\u2019s operations had significant autonomy. However, Hale suggested in his conversation with the monitor that HSBC\u2019s sprawling 70-country operation was still a significant complicating factor in the work of the bank\u2019s 7,000-strong compliance team. \u201cI think you have to appreciate it\u2019s difficult for us as a firm, we obviously operate in over 70 countries and we visited a number of countries in 2014 where we haven\u2019t executed the programme,\u201d he said. Asked whether he anticipated broad breaches in the bank\u2019s governance, Hale said there were \u201ca couple of categories\u201d where his team were considering whether policy was sufficient, as his staff still had concerns that the bank was not doing enough. He noted that to state definitively at that stage that there were broad breaches would be a \u201cbig statement to make\u201d. Pushed for more detail by the monitors, Hale identified the screening of charitable donations as an area of concern for his team. \u201cThat would be one example where I\u2019m not entirely comfortable we\u2019ve done enough,\u201d he admitted. He did not go on to detail any others. The British executive also highlighted the \u201cpainful process\u201d of improving reporting standards across the banking group to ensure compliance with sanctions policies \u2013 one of the principal causes of HSBC\u2019s record-breaking US fine. He said his team had a backlog of more than 90 dispensations requests \u2013 formal requests to perform an action that would otherwise be against HSBC policies \u2013 which he had refused to sign off because they were not in his view of a sufficiently high standard. Explaining the past difficulty of overhauling sanctions standards at the bank, Hale said HSBC staff were not used to providing the required level of detail for compliance to sign off dispensations. He said: \u201cI think it\u2019s really the first time where we\u2019ve looked to do this with the right level of rigour \u2026 the quality of the initial submissions was not great.\u201d The monitor is required each year to file a lengthy report to the Department of Justice, which in turn files a much shorter summary update to a court in New York. As the agreement was signed in December 2012, the head of the DoJ\u2019s criminal division said HSBC had the \u201csword of Damocles\u201d over its head should it not follow through on its commitments. The latest progress report, filed on Wednesday, said HSBC had made progress and was \u201cbetter protected from and positioned to detect financial crime\u201d, praising the efforts of senior executives and compliance staff. However, the report also raised several concerns about HSBC\u2019s progress, including in relation to its corporate culture, saying: \u201cSome of HSBC Group\u2019s historical cultural deficiencies continue to pervade its operations today.\u201d Senior staff in the US-based global banking and markets division were criticised specifically. Such criticism of HSBC culture is likely to come as a disappointment to the bank\u2019s North America chair, Fairhead, who previously chaired the bank\u2019s audit committee during several of the bank\u2019s high-profile ethical lapses, and who also serves as the chair of the BBC Trust and a non-executive at PepsiCo.

Premier shares are now up just 2.4p at 136p while Rockhopper has edged up 0.25p at 64p after hitting 71.5p and Falkland Oil &amp; Gas is down 3.5p at 32p. Premier owns 36% of Zebedee, Falklands Oil &amp; Gas 40% and Rockhopper 24%.",

      "bodyText": "Growth in the UK\u2019s construction sector slowed in March as customers delayed making spending decisions because of uncertainty over the general election. Housebuilders, commercial builders, and civil engineers all reported slowing output growth last month, with the rise in new orders also easing compared with February. The slowdown, indicated by the latest Markit/CIPS construction PMI, suggested the sector had \u201clost some of its swagger\u201d since last year, according to Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. \u201cAll three main categories of construction activity saw a growth slowdown in March, in part reflecting softer new business gains as some clients delayed spending decisions ahead of the general election.\u201d Despite the dip in growth, confidence among UK builders about the 12 months ahead jumped to a nine-year high in March, boosted by an improving economic backdrop and strong order books. The headline PMI index slowed to 57.8 in March from 60.1 in February. The higher the number above 50, the stronger the expansion in activity. Economists had expected a stronger performance for last month, forecasting 59.5. Jobs growth in the UK construction sector also slowed last month, but remained safely above the 50 mark at 58. David Noble, chief executive at CIPS, said the delay in spending plans triggered by the election was just a blip. \u201cThe main takeaway from this month must be the highest levels of confidence seen in the construction sector for almost a decade. Though there may be some low-level obstacles still to come, the sector gets the green light as there is evidently belief that the future for the construction sector is a sustainable one,\u201d he said. The detail of the March PMI suggested there was little sign of easing when it came to the strong cost pressures facing builders. Strong demand for construction materials combined with stock shortages pushed prices up. Firms were also hit by a lack of subcontractor availability, which fell to the lowest level in seven months in March. The growth in construction output indicated by the PMI survey is at odds with the official data from the Office for National Statistics, which suggests the sector is shrinking. The construction industry was badly hit during the financial crisis, and has yet to fully recover, with output still below pre-crisis levels. In the fourth quarter of 2014, construction output fell by 2.2% compared with the third, according to the ONS. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that following a weak start to the year, with construction output officially falling 2.6% in January, February and March would have to be particularly strong months if the sector were to show any growth in the first quarter. The construction PMI followed a better equivalent survey for the manufacturing sector, published on Wednesday. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI rose to 54.4 in March, up from 54.1 in February, its highest level since last August.",

That said, womenswear needs to be consistently better across the whole range. The occasional screamer into the top corner doesn\u2019t negate smashing the ball over the bar for the last four years.\u201d Tony Shiret at BESI Our sense is that M&amp;S has benefited in these numbers from the quantum of buying gains put in place in GM. This has allowed the late period promotional activity that has contributed to the group getting back into positive sales territory. The actual product has in our view not yet shown continuation of the more positive trends we noted in A/W 14 before the weather got too warm.\u201d David Jeary at Canaccord Genuity Our central view remains that M&amp;S is a mixed blessing business. The Food division has shown its credentials and strong customer appeal through a sustained run of positive quarterly like-for-like sales growth. In contrast, and despite the undoubted efforts to change its fortunes, the general merchandise division been a sadly disappointing corollary, with an equally sustained run of negative quarterly like-for-like sales. Returning to sustainable positive like-for-likes and stopping market share erosion in GM remain key sentiment drivers for us. Just as one swallow does not a summer make, one quarter of positive like-for-like does not a trend make.\u201d Kate Calvert at Investec We see a material gross margin opportunity in general merchandise, driven by better buying, lower markdowns and general efficiencies. A convincing return to positive general merchandise like-for-like growth is likely to be taken well by the market.\u201d Clive Black at Shore Capital That general merchandise is now potentially turning the corner, admittedly against very favourable multi-year comparatives, is to be warmly welcomed.

      "bodyText": "Energy giant E.ON has been fined nearly \u00a38m for incorrectly charging customers \u2013 the second time in two years. Energy regulator Ofgem imposed the \u00a37.75m penalty after it discovered E.ON was incorrectly charging exit fees and overcharging customers following price rises in 2013 and 2014. Under the regulator\u2019s rules, suppliers have to give customers 30 days\u2019 notice of a price rise to allow people a chance to switch to another supplier if they want to. If a customer tells their supplier they are going to move within that time, they should not be charged an exit fee or the higher energy price even if the switch takes place after the price rise. E.ON failed to follow these rules. It has already paid back \u00a3400,000 to customers who may have been affected. Those were direct debit and standard credit customers who signalled their intention to switch within the 30 day period before price rises kicked in in January 2013 and January 2014. However, E.ON later discovered that 7,000 customers on prepayment meters were also affected and is now tracking them down to refund them by the end of April. Ofgem described the delay as serious and said it took this into account when deciding the fine. The money will go to Citizens Advice to help vulnerable consumers. The penalty also takes into account that E.ON made the same billing error in 2012, when it was forced to pay back 100,000 former customers an average of \u00a315 each. This time the average repayment is about \u00a38 for direct debit customers and \u00a312 for standard credit customers. The average refund for those on pre-payment meters is \u00a33.42. \u201cE.ON\u2019s errors meant customers who took the chance to switch were wrongly charged,\u201d said Sarah Harrison, senior partner in charge of enforcement at Ofgem. \u201cIt is important that E.ON has repaid potentially affected customers and cooperated with the investigation. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s absolutely unacceptable that E.ON failed to provide these vital customer protections yet again and this persistent failure is the reason for the high penalty.\u201d E.On apologised to those affected. In a statement it said: \u201cFollowing reports from E.ON, Ofgem opened an investigation into the errors in June 2014 and has agreed today\u2019s penalty package in recognition of the company\u2019s errors. These errors meant that some customers were overcharged, although in the majority of cases this was by less than \u00a310.\u201d Thursday\u2019s fine will add to the growing tide of customer resentment against badly behaving energy companies. Last month, Scottish Power was forced to suspend all sales calls to customers for 12 days after it failed to clear a backlog of complaints and the previous month Spark Energy was ordered to pay \u00a3250,000 to Citizen\u2019s Advice for failing to treat customers properly. At the end of last year, British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power were all fined for failing to deliver energy-efficiency measures on time. Earlier this year, a Guardian/ICM survey found that the UK energy giants are even more disliked than banks. People were asked to pick which two or three villains from a rogue\u2019s gallery of businesses that they most disliked, and 46% picked gas and electricity suppliers \u2013 more than any other sector.",

The average refund for those on pre-payment meters is \u00a33.42.</p> <p>\u201cE.ON\u2019s errors meant customers who took the chance to switch were wrongly charged,\u201d said Sarah Harrison, senior partner in charge of enforcement at Ofgem. \u201cIt is important that E.ON has repaid potentially affected customers and cooperated with the investigation. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, it\u2019s absolutely unacceptable that E.ON failed to provide these vital customer protections yet again and this persistent failure is the reason for the high penalty.\u201d</p> <p>E.On apologised to those affected.</p> <p>In a statement it said: \u201cFollowing reports from E.ON, Ofgem opened an investigation into the errors in June 2014 and has agreed today\u2019s penalty package in recognition of the company\u2019s errors. These errors meant that some customers were overcharged, although in the majority of cases this was by less than \u00a310.\u201d</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s fine will add to the growing tide of customer resentment against badly behaving energy companies. </p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/mar/04/scottish-power-banned-sales-calls-ofgem\">Scottish Power was forced to suspend all sales calls to customers for 12 days after it failed to clear a backlog of complaints</a> and the previous month <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/spark-energy-pay-%C2%A3250k-citizens-advice\">Spark Energy was ordered to pay \u00a3250,000 to Citizen\u2019s Advice for failing to treat customers properly.</a> At the end of last year, British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/04/british-gas-fined-ofgem-energy-efficiency-delays\">were all fined for failing to deliver energy-efficiency measures on time. </a></p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/26/energy-giants-more-disliked-banks-guardian-icm-poll\">a Guardian/ICM survey found that the UK energy giants are even more disliked than banks</a>. <br></p> <p>People were asked to pick which two or three villains from a rogue\u2019s gallery of businesses that they most disliked, and 46% picked gas and electricity suppliers \u2013 more than any other sector.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has delivered its first rise in clothing sales in four years after a pickup in performance at its website. Sales of clothing and homewares at established stores rose by 0.7% in the 13 weeks to 28 March compared with a 5.8% slide in the previous three months. The tentative step into positive territory, ahead of analyst expectations, comes after 16 quarters without growth. It was also achieved in the face of a tricky spring for fashion retailers, with much chillier weather than this time last year. M&amp;S credited improvements in style and quality as well as positive press coverage, particularly of a suede skirt which has yet to arrive in stores, for the sales turnaround. But performance was largely lifted by a return to growth at M&amp;S.com, where sales rose 13.8%, a considerable bounce from the 6% slump over Christmas, when business was affected by problems at the group\u2019s distribution centre in Castle Donington. The chief executive, Marc Bolland, said sales of womenswear, menswear, childrenswear and home furnishings had all increased as shoppers perceived an improvement in style and quality at the chain. He said M&amp;S\u2019s top-priced brand Autograph, and The Limited, its most fashionable label, had both enjoyed underlying growth of close to 10%. He said: \u201cPeople are looking for quality and style and we\u2019re benefiting from that. Our spring/summer collection has done very well. Customers have reacted very positively to it and it\u2019s been bang on trend.\u201d Food sales rose 3.7% in total or 0.7% once the impact of new store openings was stripped out, a good performance in a tough market in which a price war is affecting all the major supermarkets. The company said it had enjoyed record Valentine\u2019s Day sales. Shares in the retailer leapt 6% to 561p in early trading as some analysts said they were preparing to upgrade annual profit forecasts in the light of the better sales, tighter controls on costs and an on-target rise in profit margins. Bolland, who has been under increasing pressure to demonstrate signs of a recovery in M&amp;S\u2019s fashion fortunes, refused to mark the quarter as a definitive about-turn. He said: \u201cI am not going to step away from my step-by-step story ... This is another step in the right direction.\u201d He reiterated his commitment to the group, saying: \u201cI really enjoy my role. I have enjoyed the past few years and there is still more to do.\u201d The Dutchman brought in the former Debenhams boss Belinda Earl to work with John Dixon, the M&amp;S \u201clifer\u201d who was put in charge of clothing and homewares two-and-a-half years ago. Dixon had previously revived the fortunes of the group\u2019s food division. Bolland joined M&amp;S from Morrisons, the supermarket chain, in 2010, and has since invested heavily in revamping stores as well as trying to modernise the group\u2019s outdated IT systems and distribution setup. Analysts welcomed Thursday\u2019s update as the first sign of success for Bolland\u2019s strategy for the non-food business. However, David Jeary at Canaccord Genuity warned: \u201cJust as one swallow does not a summer make, one quarter of positive like-for-like does not a trend make.\u201d They were also concerned about performance overseas, a key plank of Bolland\u2019s revival plans for M&amp;S. Sales fell 3.8% as the retailer\u2019s franchise operators suffered from the political and economic problems in Russia, Ukraine and Turkey. M&amp;S said those issues had \u201csignificantly impacted\u201d profits from outside the UK. Tony Shiret, the veteran retail analyst at BESI, said like-for-like clothing sales in M&amp;S\u2019s stores were still likely to be falling by as much as 2% because the top line was boosted by online sales. He also suggested that M&amp;S had been able to boost trade with discounts underpinned by new ways of cutting deals with suppliers which were helping to boost profit margins. \u201cWe do not believe that today is a key opinion-changing day for M&amp;S,\u201d he wrote in a note. Bolland insisted clothing sales were \u201cflat\u201d rather than falling in stores. He said: \u201cPredominantly, growth has come from online but like-for-like sales are strong compared to others.\u201d",

But performance was largely lifted by a return to growth at M&amp;S.com, where sales rose 13.8%, a considerable bounce from the 6% slump over Christmas, when business was affected by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/07/marks-and-spencer-delays-online-orders\">problems at the group\u2019s distribution centre in Castle Donington</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"M&amp;S like-for-likes sales growth graphic\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1427982376705/M&amp;S-sales.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The chief executive, Marc Bolland, said sales of womenswear, menswear, childrenswear and home furnishings had all increased as shoppers perceived an improvement in style and quality at the chain. He said M&amp;S\u2019s top-priced brand Autograph, and The Limited, its most fashionable label, had both enjoyed underlying growth of close to 10%. </p> <p>He said: \u201cPeople are looking for quality and style and we\u2019re benefiting from that. Our spring/summer collection has done very well. Customers have reacted very positively to it and it\u2019s been bang on trend.\u201d <br></p> <p>Food sales rose 3.7% in total or 0.7% once the impact of new store openings was stripped out, a good performance in a tough market in which a price war is affecting all the major supermarkets. The company said it had enjoyed record Valentine\u2019s Day sales.</p> <p>Shares in the retailer leapt 6% to 561p in early trading as some analysts said they were preparing to upgrade annual profit forecasts in the light of the better sales, tighter controls on costs and an on-target rise in profit margins.</p> <p>Bolland, who has been under increasing pressure to demonstrate signs of a recovery in M&amp;S\u2019s fashion fortunes, refused to mark the quarter as a definitive about-turn. He said: \u201cI am not going to step away from my step-by-step story ... This is another step in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>He reiterated his commitment to the group, saying: \u201cI really enjoy my role. I have enjoyed the past few years and there is still more to do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/apr/01/this-seasons-cult-item-the-autograph-suede-skirt\">This season's cult item: The Autograph suede skirt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Dutchman brought in the former Debenhams boss Belinda Earl to work with John Dixon, the M&amp;S \u201clifer\u201d who was put in charge of clothing and homewares two-and-a-half years ago. Dixon had previously revived the fortunes of the group\u2019s food division. Bolland joined M&amp;S from Morrisons, the supermarket chain, in 2010, and has since invested heavily in revamping stores as well as trying to modernise the group\u2019s outdated IT systems and distribution setup.</p> <p>Analysts welcomed Thursday\u2019s update as the first sign of success for Bolland\u2019s strategy for the non-food business.</p> <p>However, David Jeary at Canaccord Genuity warned: \u201cJust as one swallow does not a summer make, one quarter of positive like-for-like does not a trend make.\u201d</p> <p>They were also concerned about performance overseas, a key plank of Bolland\u2019s revival plans for M&amp;S. Sales fell 3.8% as the retailer\u2019s franchise operators suffered from the political and economic problems in Russia, Ukraine and Turkey. M&amp;S said those issues had \u201csignificantly impacted\u201d profits from outside the UK.</p> <p>Tony Shiret, the veteran retail analyst at BESI, said like-for-like clothing sales in M&amp;S\u2019s stores were still likely to be falling by as much as 2% because the top line was boosted by online sales. He also suggested that M&amp;S had been able to boost trade with discounts underpinned by new ways of cutting deals with suppliers which were helping to boost profit margins. \u201cWe do not believe that today is a key opinion-changing day for M&amp;S,\u201d he wrote in a note.</p> <p>Bolland insisted clothing sales were \u201cflat\u201d rather than falling in stores. He said: \u201cPredominantly, growth has come from online but like-for-like sales are strong compared to others.\u201d</p>",
