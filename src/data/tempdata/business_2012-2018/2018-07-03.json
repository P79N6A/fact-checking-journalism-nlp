      "bodyText": "Glencore is the Swiss-based FTSE 100 miner that goes where others fear to tread. The hunt for higher returns hasn\u2019t obviously paid off \u2013 the 2011 flotation price of 530p hasn\u2019t been seen since \u2013 but the company\u2019s appetite to operate in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is undimmed. It\u2019s what chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, and his crew do. The stock market has just had to learn to price the risks. It struggled in that task on Tuesday after Glencore said it had received a subpoena from the US justice department (DoJ) to produce documents relating to its operations in DRC, where it has two copper and cobalt mines, and also in Nigeria and Venezuela, where it trades oil. The DoJ wants to know how Glencore has complied with bribery and money laundering statutes and is looking as far back as 2007. At one point, the share price fell 12%, before closing 8% lower. The market\u2019s confusion is understandable. Some DoJ requests for information go nowhere. But this demand has arrived at such a delicate moment it is hard to believe the timing is coincidental. Less than a month ago, Glencore settled a long-running dispute in DRC with its former partner Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire on whom the US imposed sanctions last year. To keep control of its mines, Glencore resumed multimillion royalty payments to Gertler but thought it was safe to do so, from a sanctions perspective, because the payments would be in euros. Would the US authorites really tolerate that arrangement? Perhaps they would if bigger wheels were turning in the background. For example: if the US feared Glencore\u2019s huge ouput in the DRC of cobalt, used in batteries, mobile phones and electric cars, could fall into Chinese hands while trade war threats are flying, would it privately smile upon the settlement? That thought comforted investors \u2013 not least because Glencore said it had met with US authorities. But now the DoJ is on the prowl anyway. Is it just reminding Glasenberg of its presence? Is it acting independently of the US Treasury? Could its subpoena be about something else entirely? Those questions will hang in the air until facts emerge. As things stand, investors can only contemplate the alarming combination of a controversial deal in the DRC and an unpredictable administration in Washington. It is reminder of why some fund managers have always regarded Glencore as un-investable. Ofwat seeks to end timidity \u201cThe decisions some water companies have made on dividends, financial structures and top executive pay have damaged customer trust,\u201d says Ofwat chief executive Rachel Fletcher, accurately. The regulator intends to get heavier on all fronts and some of its ideas are clearly better than the timid hands-off approach of the past. If companies take higher-risk bets with their balance sheets, by cranking up borrowings beyond the 60% leverage ratio in Ofwat\u2019s model, they\u2019ll have to share some of the winnings with customers. Yet the watchdog\u2019s proposals on pay look more bark than bite. Companies will have to show \u201ca substantial link\u201d between executives\u2019 incentives and \u201cperformance delivery\u201d for customers. What does \u201csubstantial\u201d mean? Ofwat didn\u2019t say, which companies may interpret as a green light to offer a few token gestures while leaving in place potentially lucrative schemes based on returns to shareholders. Indeed, the structure of rewards is only half the problem. Trust has also been damaged by the sheer size of pay packets. Or, at least, that\u2019s what the environment secretary, Michael Gove, suggested in a speech to water company bosses in March in which he ran through a few recent highlights \u2013 \u00a32.8m for the chief executive of United Utilities, \u00a32.4m at Severn Trent and \u00a31.2m apiece at Anglian and Yorkshire. \u201cYou must realise that, in the public eye, you are very handsomely remunerated,\u201d said Gove. Fair point. But Ofwat is powerless to curb the quantum of pay. As long as that remains the case, one suspects its \u201csubstantial link\u201d to leakage targets, and suchlike, will get lost in the wash. Monk-y business The Dutch digital advertising folk at MediaMonks will be laughing into their habits. They\u2019ve arranged an auction of their production company and as, luck would have it, two parties waving their hands in the air have reasons to bid aggressively. One is Sir Martin Sorrell, who will want to get his post-WPP career off to a flyer. The other is WPP itself, which will be desperate to show that its failure to impose a non-compete clause on Sorrell was less embarrassing than it looks. The chance of somebody overpaying is high.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s construction industry staged a stronger than expected recovery in June, overcoming the worst of a slowdown this year and helping edge the Bank of England closer towards raising interest rates. After suffering during the heavy snow earlier this year, when diggers and cranes were forced to fall idle across the country, bright sunshine and warmer weather over the past month helped builders back to work. According to the latest survey from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, there was the largest upturn in buying construction materials for two-and-a-half years in June. The gauge of activity on the purchasing managers index \u2013 closely watched by the Bank for signs of economic strength \u2013 rose to 53.1 from 52.5 in May, hitting the highest level in seven months against economists\u2019 expectations of a static reading. Anything above 50 on the PMI reflects growth in economic activity rather than contraction. The rebound for the industry could suggest much of the weakness earlier this year was the result of the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d and was not triggered by a broader malaise for the building trade. Dismissing the fears of a slowdown on Tuesday, Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said the UK economy was continuing to grow at a modest and steady pace, similar to the average of the past couple of years. In an interview with CNBC, Saunders warned that interest rates would need to rise should the UK economy continue to show signs of strength. \u201cIf the economy plays out as I expect, it may be that rates need to go up a little faster,\u201d he said. Threadneedle Street delayed raising the cost of borrowing after weak economic data in the wake of heavy snowfall earlier this year, although the Bank has since opened the door for an interest rate hike in August. The Office for National Statistics also revised higher its estimate for economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to better readings from the construction industry. The ONS said last week the economy grew by 0.2% in the first quarter, against two earlier forecasts for growth of 0.1%. Observers said big-ticket infrastructure projects such as the expansion of Heathrow \u2013 backed by MPs last week \u2013 and HS2 would be crucial to ensuring the UK remains an infrastructure leader on the world stage after Britain leaves the EU. Brexit uncertainty has caused some businesses to put construction projects on hold in recent months, which could make government spending key for encouraging firms to invest in Britain. Optimism was strongest outside London in the IHS Markit/Cips survey, with particular strength seen in the north-west, West Midlands and Bristol. While the house building industry drove much of the growth there were fewer new projects for civil engineers, holding back stronger growth. Despite the better news, Samuel Tombs of the economics consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said the outlook remained bleak for the year ahead as the UK leaves the EU. He said the proportion of builders in the survey expecting activity to increase over the next year remains was well below the 20-year average for the poll. Max Jones of Lloyds Bank said: \u201cThe sector is hardly motoring, with some large contractors blaming Brexit uncertainty for the delay or cancellation of projects.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed higher, as traders welcomed a day without trade war escalation. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 45 points or 0.6% to close at 7953, while the German DAX gained 0.9% and the French CAC picked up 0.75%. The reassuring noises out of Beijing today helped to calm nerves (although perhaps only temporarily), as did the German coalition deal on migration. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Stocks are higher as improved political relations in Germany and constructive trade comments from China has lifted investor sentiment. Angela Merkel has brokered a deal with Horst Seehofer which will keep their alliance intact. The positive mood might not last long though, as the Social Democrats need to inspect the agreement. An official from the People\u2019s Bank of China announced they will not use the yuan as a tool in the trade spat with the US, and traders are taking this as a step in the right direct for global trading relations. That\u2019s probably all for today. GW Time for a quick recap. Chinese central bankers have vowed not to use their currency as a weapon in the trade conflict with the U.S. The People\u2019s Bank of China has pledged to keep the yuan stable, after seeing it slide to its weakest level in almost a year. PBOC insisted that Beijing is committed to upholding \u201cmultilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based global guidelines\u201d, a roll-call of causes under threat from America\u2019s protectionist moves. Sun Guofeng, head of the central bank\u2019s financial research institute, told Bloomberg: \u201cRecently the yuan\u2019s exchange rate has shown some weakness. This is entirely due to changes in market expectations as external uncertainties rise rather than intended guidance of the central bank. China upholds multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based international guidelines, and will not make the yuan\u2019s exchange rate a tool to cope with trade conflicts.\u201d PBOC also pledged to maintain the yuan at a \u201creasonable, equilibrium\u201d level. This has helped to pull the yuan back up; earlier today it tipped below the 6.7 mark against the US dollar. Donald Trump has defended his policy of pushing other countries to reform their trade rules, or be hit with fresh tariffs. European stock markets are recovering from Monday\u2019s losses. In London, the FTSE 100 is now up 76 points (1%) at 7622. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says European investors are relieved that Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition crisis has been resolved. A day after the German interior minister offered his resignation over Germany\u2019s policy on immigrants, a move that had serious implications on the country\u2019s brittle coalition government, Chancellor Angela Merkel managed to pull Germany back from the brink with a last minute deal which has pacified the rebels in her government. There was a collective sigh of relief across European stock markets Britain\u2019s construction sector has posted stronger growth. Housebuilding helped to push activity up last month, but Brexit uncertainty may be restricting big projects. There\u2019s no wild dramas on Wall Street...yet anyway. The US stock market has opened calmly, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 109 points, or 0.4%. China\u2019s central bank\u2019s pledge not to use the yuan as a tool in the trade conflict with America is providing some reassurance. But, analyst Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern believes the PBOC may have to back up its words with actions, and prop up the yuan if it falls again. Indian industrialist S.M. Lodha has warned that Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to shake up global trade will backfire. Lodha, who chairs UK insulation firm Western Thermal Limited, believes US firms will suffer as the EU, China, Canada and Mexico impose retaliatory tariffs. Lodha explains: \u201cThe trade tariffs imposed by President Trump on America\u2019s closest allies including Canada, Mexico, European Union and India, are strategically misplaced and self-defeating as it stands to directly weaken the US economy. The US Chamber of Commerce, the country\u2019s largest lobbying group which has been historically close to Republican administrations, have themselves gone on record to denounce Trump\u2019s erroneous idea of putting \u201cAmerica First\u201d though trade wars. As President Trump\u2019s steel tariff directly affects countries including Canada, EU and India, the EU has already warned that an estimated $300 billion worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures. Even Canada has vowed to impose punitive countermeasures which can see over $12.6 billion worth of American goods being directly hit. Therefore, it is the American exporters who would be bearing a brunt over something the illogical and politically misguided actions of President Trump. If a country imposes tariffs on another, one can\u2019t complain if they retaliate. This is a key \u2018Art of the Deal\u2019 Mr Trump seems to have missed.\u201d Newsflash: China\u2019s central bank has promised not to launch a currency war against America. Bloomberg has the details: China is committed to multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based global guidelines, Sun Guofeng, director of the PBOC\u2019s financial research institute, said in a written response to Bloomberg News. That\u2019s an interesting pledge, given that the yuan (which is tightly controlled by Beijing) fell to an 11-month low today. Even the PBOC can only have so much effect - if Chinese companies and wealthy citizens try to move capital overseas, the yuan will fall. A weaker yuan also helps Chinese exporters, allowing them to cut prices and cushion the blow of US tariffs. Sun Guofeng\u2019s pledge seems to be reassuring the markets, pushing the yuan a little higher against the US dollar away from today\u2019s 6.7 low. The Treasury committee has been quizzing tax experts this morning, and hearing that online giants are still getting an unfair advantage. Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, asked Richard Allen, the founder of group Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, whether recent changes in the Finance Act had been effective in cracking down on VAT fraud by sellers on Ebay, Amazon and other online marketplaces. Allen replied that the measures were not tough enough and that legislation was \u201cmore relaxed\u201d than in Germany. Elphicke asked: \u201cCompared to Germany, our taxpayers are still being taken for a ride and Amazon are still in a position where they are not having to hand over information?\u201d Allen agreed, saying: \u201cSmall traders get very annoyed when they find themselves being investigated for VAT when big companies don\u2019t seem to get the same kind of attention. I was told by senior officials they\u2019d been instructed, HMRC had been instructed not to go too hard on Amazon yet.\u201d This has resulted in online firms having an unfair competitive advantage over high street retailers. \u201cThe regulatory environment in which these online businesses operate is not as tough as the regulatory environment for highstreet retailers.\u201d Allen added: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t sell dangerous products in a shop. You couldn\u2019t openly sell goods where there is no VAT charge in a shop\u2026 There is a huge imbalance between online retail and high street retail.\u201d His biggest concern is that online retailers are unregulated private marketplaces operated by one company. \u201cThe owner of a private marketplace online gets to see the sales data of everyone selling on that platform and can use that to their advantage selling products themselves.\u201d This means \u201cthey can manipulate prices on their own marketplace,\u201d Allen said, adding that Amazon sometimes sold lost leaders to maintain its market position. He is backing a VAT surcharge on overseas retailers selling goods in Britain \u2013 a similar measure is working well in Australia, he said. \u201cIt would introduce an extra cost on these cheap imports that would protect British retailers from an avalanche of cheap stuff\u201d. Exactly 49 days before Greece exits its third and final EU-sponsored bailout programme, the bloc\u2019s economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici is visiting the country \u2013 with a message of hope. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The French have done more to back Greece than any other euro zone member in the nine years since the country almost crashed on the rocks of bankruptcy and as one of Paris\u2019 most prominent politicians, Pierre Moscovici is an embodiment of that support. On a flying one-day visit Tuesday, the EU\u2019s economics chief insisted there were no ifs and buts to Greece\u2019s ordeal finally being over. \u201cThe time has come for Greece to be a normal country,\u201d said Moscovici emphasising that oversight of the nation once it exited its last economic adjustment program would not amount to a fourth bailout. He told the Greek parliament: \u201cThere is no more program for Greece. There won\u2019t be any more programs for Greece.\u201d Meeting the nation\u2019s head of state earlier, Moscovici said the agreement euro zone countries had reached last month to reduce the country\u2019s staggering debt load had \u201copened a new road with new conditions and prospects\u201d for Greece. \u201cI know well that the story that we all experienced had tragic aspects and was dangerous for the euro zone and very, very difficult for the Greeks,\u201d he said referring to the depression the country had suffered as it applied tough austerity and structural reforms in exchange for rescue funds. Moscovici added he would never forget the pensioners who had had their pensions slashed, workers who had lost jobs, and families who had seen their children leave for wealthier climes. Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, who also met Moscovici, praised his supra-nationalism saying he and his team had worked for the good of Europe even if along the way \u201cwe had very big disagreements.\u201d Greece exits its third bailout programme on August 20. Another early start for the US president...and a chance to bang the drum for trade reform. I suspect \u2018most countries\u2019 would also rather the president tackled the issue in a more multilateral way, rather than using \u2018national security threats\u2019 to justify new tariffs on nations that saw themselves as US allies.... Good news from Ireland: the country\u2019s jobless rate has hit a 10-year low. Irish unemployment fell to just 5.1% in June, the central statistics office reports. It\u2019s not been this low since October 2007, just after the credit crunch struck. Ireland\u2019s jobless rate has been falling steadily since its bailout ended in 2013, and is someway below the eurozone average of over 8%. World stock markets are staging a recovery from yesterday\u2019s slides, after China\u2019s central bank tried to calm the panic. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 32 points or 0.44% to 7580 (it would be more, but for Glencore\u2019s slump). The other European markets are also up, with Germany\u2019s DAX leading the way after Angela Merkel resolved the migration dispute that was threatening to rip her coalition apart. Investors have been cheered by the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s pledge to protect the yuan at a \u201creasonable, equilibrium\u201d level, after it hit an 11-month low toda. Although we\u2019ve not got details, that feels like a promise not to allow the yuan to plunge alarmingly. Even so, trade war fears still dominate the markets - with America and China set to impose retaliatory tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of exports later this week. Mihir Kapadia, founder of Sun Global Investments, explains: \u201cAt the end of the Asian trading day, markets in China are in a more nervous state than last week as investors fear the dispute between the United States and other nations will have a significant and serious impact on global growth. The Chinese yuan fell to an 11 month low, unsettling investors and causing the Chinese central bank to pledge to keep the currency stable. Despite similar tensions over tariffs on EU goods, European markets saw some relief on the back of a migration deal that appears to have helped to stabilise Merkel\u2019s coalition government and has allayed fears of German political uncertainty at least for the time being. With President Trump setting an implementation deadline for the extra US$ 200bn of tariffs against China for this Friday, the markets reflect the anxiety and concern of many investors and stockholders with multi-billion dollar tariffs due to hit the world\u2019s second biggest economy. With the dispute continuing to escalate, it is likely that global markets will feel the force of the tariffs set to be imposed by both nations, with Chinese companies likely to be hit the hardest.\u201d It\u2019s a little early, but we should raise a glass to Britain\u2019s gin industry, which has enjoyed a bumper year. Sales of UK-produced gin jumped by 32.5% in 2017 to \u00a3461m, the Office for National Statistics reports. That follows a spate of new distillery openings across the country, the rise of \u2018craft\u2019 or artisan gins, and even special gin festivals. Britain\u2019s food producers were the largest division of UK manufacturing, creating \u00a370bn of products sold at home and around the world. Petrol cars were the biggest single product category last year, with sales over \u00a320bn. Aircraft parts and diesel cars were also very significant . Beer also shone last year, breaking back into the list of top 10 products. More here. Hold on. Max Jones, global Corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, argues that Brexit is hurting the UK building sector. He points out that large construction projects are being held back, despite the rise in activity last month: \u201cThe industry has regained some confidence after the lows of earlier this year. The bounce-back in Q2 appears to confirm that much of the weakness in the first quarter was the result of shutdowns in the wake of the Beast from the East rather than anything more structural. \u201cBut the sector is hardly motoring, with some large contractors blaming Brexit uncertainty for the delay or cancellation of projects. The London market also looks significantly exposed to any reduction in EU labour. \u201cNevertheless, the announcement of approval for a new runway at Heathrow has boosted sentiment in the sector, if not yet order books and revenue. But with Heathrow, Hinkley Point and HS2 all now given the green light, the focus shifts to the next mega-project that will offer firms comfort and visibility over their long-term pipelines.\u201d Britain\u2019s construction sector appears to be shrugging off economic anxiety (despite the looming shadow of Brexit), says Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. \u201cWith the fastest rise in new orders since May 2017, it appears the brakes are off for the construction sector. Despite being hampered by economic uncertainty, firms reported an improved pipeline of work as clients committed to projects and hesitancy was swept away. \u201cInput prices were a challenge with the biggest inflationary rise since September 2017, so the pressure was on to build up stocks of materials rising in price and becoming more scarce. This resulted in a heavy impact on suppliers unable to keep pace as deliveries became laboured and purchasing managers were at their busiest for two and a half years. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s housing sector has strengthened, thanks to a pick-up in house-building. Data firm Markit reports that construction activity accelerated last month, at the fastest pace since November 2017. New orders jumped, prompting companies to splash out on new materials - driving prices up. This all propelled Markit\u2019s construction PMI (which measures activity) up to 53.1 in June, from 52.5 in May, beating expectations. Encouragingly, optimism in the construction sector picked up in June, from May\u2019s seven-month low. Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, says Britain\u2019s builders are getting back to work after the winter slowdown. \u201cThe latest increase in UK construction output marks three months of sustained recovery from the snow-related disruption seen back in March. A solid contribution from house building helped to drive up overall construction activity in June, while a lack of new work to replace completed civil engineering projects continued to hold back growth. I\u201dll pull together some reaction now. The DoJ subpoena means problems are mounting up for Glencore. Bloomberg\u2019s Thomas Biesheuvel explains: It\u2019s been a tumultuous year for Glencore, mostly due to challenges linked to its business in the Congo, where it operates giant copper and cobalt mines. The Swiss company trader and miner is already facing the possibility of a bribery investigation by U.K. prosecutors over its work with Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire and close friend of Congo President Joseph Kabila, people familiar with the situation said in May. Last November, the Paradise Papers expose showed Glencore\u2019s links to Israeli mining billionaire Dan Gertler in Africa, including in the DRC. Wow. Around \u00a35bn has been wiped off Glencore\u2019s value by today\u2019s selloff. Newsflash: The world\u2019s biggest commodity trading firm is caught up in a US investigation. Glencore told the City that it has received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice, asking for documents covering its activities in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela. The investigation relates to US laws covering money-laundering and bribery of foreign officials. Here\u2019s the statement: Glencore Ltd, a subsidiary of Glencore plc, has received a subpoena dated 2 July, 2018 from the US Department of Justice to produce documents and other records with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United States money laundering statutes. The requested documents relate to the Glencore Group\u2019s business in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela from 2007 to present. Glencore is reviewing the subpoena and will provide further information in due course as appropriate. Glencore shares have tumbled by 9% as City traders digest the news, hitting their lowest level in almost a year: China\u2019s top central banker has blamed America for the yuan\u2019s weakness. In a statement, Yi Gang, governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), says: \u201cRecently, there have been some fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. We are paying close attention to this, \u201cThis is mainly due to factors such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and external uncertainties.\u201d Yi does have a point - emerging market currencies are all suffering from the dollar\u2019s revival. The Vietnamese dong has also been under pressure, hitting an all-time low against the dollar today. The People\u2019s Bank of China has launched an attempt to reassure Chinese investors and prevent the yuan falling further. In a statement released a few minutes ago, PBOC says it is \u201cclosely watching\u201d moves in the foreign exchange markets. Importantly, the Bank is also pledging to keep the yuan \u201cstable\u201d at a \u201creasonable, equilibrium\u201d level. It\u2019s also promising to maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy. This \u2018verbal operation\u2019 seems to be having an effect - the yuan is dragging itself back off the mat, recovering some (but not all!) of its losses today. ING\u2019s China economist Iris Pang also blames Trump\u2019s tariffs for causing the yuan\u2019s decline, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s depreciation is market-driven, reflecting the risks of a trade war. This implies that the central bank is allowing market forces to dictate the speed of the depreciation when there is room to do so.\u201d Chinese banks scrambled to prop up the yuan after it fell through the 6.7 level against the US dollar this morning. Bloomberg explains: Chinese banks were seen selling dollars after the yuan weakened past a key level, stoking speculation that authorities were seeking to slow the losses. The yuan was 0.5% lower at 6.6981 per dollar at 11:31 a.m. in Shanghai after earlier falling to 6.7204. Some Chinese major banks sold the dollar in the swaps market, according to four traders. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s no escape from trade war fears today. Asian stock markets have fallen to their lowest levels since last autumn, after Donald Trump refused to cave into international pressure over his tariffs. A volatile day\u2019s trading saw China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index shed another 1.9% to a 28-month low, before rebounding in a late rally. The Chinese yuan also had a bad day, sliding against the dollar to its weakest level in almost a year. Both the onshore and offshore yuan have fallen through the 6.7 per dollar level for the first time since August 2017. The selloff suggests that Asian investors have been badly shaken by the looming tit-for-tat tariffs between China and America. US tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products are due to kick in on July 6, with China set to retaliate with duties of its own on the same value of American goods. A trade was could hurt China\u2019s economy badly, at a time when Beijing is trying to tackle its shadow banking sector and continue the evolution from a manufacturing-driven economy to a services-led one. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says the sharp depreciation in the Chinese currency is worrying investors. He reminds us that a similar slump three years ago spooked the global markets: In August 2015, USD-CNY appreciated from 6.21 to 6.44, a two-day gain of 3.85%. As a result, global stock markets sold off sharply as investors feared the beginning of a currency war. With trade tensions increasing day by day, Beijing might be playing this game as a tool in its trade war with the U.S. However, such a strategy will be a double-edged sword as it might also lead to a flight of capital which the PBoC is well aware of. Although the Chinese currency depreciated 3.23% in June, it didn\u2019t sound quite so alarming, given that the Dollar appreciated against most major currencies in May and June. Going forward it\u2019s going to be about the pace and magnitude of the currency moves that will drive equity markets. CNYUSD traded at 6.70 at the time of writing and will keep a close eye on 6.96, the lowest level reached in January 2017. The White House is pressing on with its plans to penalise trading partners unless they give America a better deal. Yesterday, president Trump insisted that the World Trade Organisation must reform, after \u201ctreating us very badly for many, many years.\u201d Also coming up today: A new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s builders is published this morning. The construction PMI is expected to show another month of slow growth, as the collapse of Carillion in January continues to ripple through the sector European stock markets are expected to rise, after Angela Merkel reached a deal on migration with interior minister, Horst Seehofer that should prevent her coalition from collapsing. We also get new eurozone retail sales and US manufacturing orders data, which will show whether trade war fears are having an impact.

The US Chamber of Commerce, the country\u2019s largest lobbying group which has been historically close to Republican administrations, have themselves gone on record to denounce Trump\u2019s erroneous idea of putting \u201cAmerica First\u201d though trade wars.</p> <p>As President Trump\u2019s steel tariff directly affects countries including Canada, EU and India, the EU has already warned that an estimated $300 billion worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures. Even Canada has vowed to impose punitive countermeasures which can see over $12.6 billion worth of American goods being directly hit.</p> <p>Therefore, it is the American exporters who would be bearing a brunt over something the illogical and politically misguided actions of President Trump. If a country imposes tariffs on another, one can\u2019t complain if they retaliate.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Glencore, the world\u2019s biggest mining company, faces a potential investigation by US authorities for alleged money laundering, after being ordered to hand over documents to the Department of Justice. Shares in the Anglo-Swiss firm fell as much as 13% to a one-year low in London, wiping more than \u00a35bn off its market value. They were later down 4.3% at 334.45p. The subpoena relates to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and US money laundering laws, Glencore said. The documents requested relate to its business dealings in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela, from 2007 to the present day. \u201cGlencore is reviewing the subpoena and will provide further information in due course as appropriate,\u201d the company said. It operates large copper and cobalt mines in Congo, and trades with Nigeria and Venezuela. It accounts for more than a quarter of the world\u2019s cobalt output, most of it from Congo. The Paradise Papers revealed last year that Glencore secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars to Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire, after it enlisted him to secure a controversial mining agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The human rights watchdog Public Eye filed a criminal complaint against Glencore in Switzerland, where the company is based, following the revelations. US sanctions on Gertler triggered litigation in the country that threatened to disrupt supplies of cobalt from the world\u2019s biggest producer of the metal. Glencore has headed off two of the main legal challenges in Congo. It recently settled a mining dispute with two companies associated with Gertler by agreeing to pay royalties in euros rather than dollars. The group also reached a settlement in another dispute involving its Kamoto copper and cobalt mine in the country. But it remains at odds with the Congolese government over a new mining law. Foreign miners face higher royalties, new taxes and policies that will restrict the repatriation of profits. Peter Jones, a campaign leader at the NGO Global Witness, said: \u201cIt is vital that any wrongdoing is brought to light and that those responsible are held to account. It looks like full scrutiny may finally be focused on Glencore\u2019s dealings. \u201cHolding Glencore accountable is a huge step in global accountability more generally. It would set a precedent for companies all over the world who, in many cases, are able to act with impunity in regards to the world\u2019s mineral wealth.\u201d Glencore and Gertler have consistently denied any wrongdoing in their business deals. It has been a difficult year for Glencore so far. In Venezuela, the company is among oil traders accused of paying bribes to get the inside track on oil deals, according to a lawsuit filed by a trust for Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela in March. In April, Glencore started cutting its ties with the Russian aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska after new US sanctions against his business empire were announced. Glencore, run by billionaire Ivan Glasenberg, was founded in 1974. The company\u2019s shares began trading on the FTSE in 2011 and it became one of the world\u2019s largest natural resource groups after the takeover of Xstrata in 2013. Headquartered in Baar, Switzerland, it has mines and offices in 50 countries. The company made a $14.7bn profit last year, up 44% on the back of higher commodity prices, and announced a big payout to shareholders via a dividend of $0.20 a share. Cobalt prices have surged, as many carmakers are shifting their focus to electric vehicles. Cobalt is used in batteries for electric vehicles, smartphones and other mobile technology.",

      "bodyText": "KPMG is being investigated by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) over its audit of Conviviality, the owner of Bargain Booze which collapsed earlier this year. The accountancy watchdog said it had begun investigation into KPMG\u2019s preparation and approval of the drinks company\u2019s financial statements for the year ended April 2017. Conviviality fell into administration on 5 April this year resulting in its drinks wholesale and retail businesses being sold off to separate parties. The collapse of the once-respected stock market firm came after three profit warnings in as many weeks, the first of which was blamed on an arithmetical error by a member of the finance team. A week later, Conviviality revealed it had also discovered a \u00a330m tax bill for which it had not budgeted. The investigation comes after KPMG was singled out by the industry regulator in a report that concluded the overall quality of the audit profession was in decline. The FRC said there had been an \u201cunacceptable deterioration\u201d in the quality of the firm\u2019s work. KPMG is already being investigated by the FRC over its role in the collapse of construction firm Carillion. The company, which was involved in the HS2 rail link as well as providing services such as cleaning prisons, went into compulsory liquidation in January with debts of \u00a31.3bn, a pension deficit of nearly \u00a31bn and a host of unfinished public contracts. A spokesperson for KPMG said: \u201cWe note today\u2019s announcement by the FRC of its investigation of the preparation, approval and audit of the financial statements of Conviviality for the year ended 30 April 2017. We believe we conducted our audit appropriately and will cooperate fully with the investigation. \u201cAs reported by the company, it experienced margin weakness at the start of 2018 and also a significant payment to HMRC which had not been included within its short-term cash flow projections, creating a short-term funding requirement. Our audit of the company\u2019s financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2018 had not yet commenced at the point [at] which administrators were appointed.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Excessive payouts for the bosses of England\u2019s privatised water companies and their investors have damaged customer trust and could be curbed in future, the industry watchdog has said. Warning of intervention powers over executive pay and dividends, Ofwat said it would run an assessment over the winter to check whether water companies were doing enough to link performance-related pay to customer delivery. Firms will submit their business plans, including their pay and dividend policies, to the regulator this September. Rachel Fletcher, the watchdog\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe decisions some water companies have made on dividends, financial structures and top executive pay have damaged customer trust.\u201d She added that Ofwat would strengthen the incentive on companies to improve their performance for customers, while cutting the rewards that come from financial engineering \u2013 which involves firms ratcheting up their debts and using complex corporate structures. \u201cThis is an important step in making sure water companies put customers\u2019 interests and those of future generations, at the heart of all the decisions they take,\u201d she said. Water industry bosses faced sharp criticism last month after the GMB trade union found they had banked \u00a358m in pay and benefits over the last five years while customers have faced above-inflation rises in their water bills. Household water bills have risen by 40% above inflation since the industry was privatised in 1989, according to a National Audit Office report. The move from Ofwat also comes after the environment secretary, Michael Gove, attacked water companies for paying their bosses large salaries and huge dividends to shareholders while contributing little or no tax. Labour has promised to bring water companies back into public ownership to save households money, amid rising public anger over pay and poor performance. Ofwat issued a damning report last month, finding that water companies badly let down their customers during the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d weather earlier this year. More than 200,000 households were cut off, yet compensation payouts totalled only \u00a37m. The watchdog\u2019s new rules announced on Tuesday govern the period 2020 to 2025 and will force companies paying dividends above 5% to explain why that would be in their customers\u2019 interests and not just for the benefit of their investors.",

      "bodyText": "A plant-based burger that \u201cbleeds\u201d from US brand Beyond Meat is to make its UK retail debut in Tesco in the first week of August. The Beyond burger \u2013 the company\u2019s flagship vegan-friendly product which sold out after its May 2016 launch in the US \u2013 will be stocked alongside meat in in 350 branches of Tesco, in time for Britons\u2019 late summer BBQs. Unlike controversial \u201clab-grown\u201d meats being developed in the US, the Beyond burger is made entirely from plants, does not use animal stem-cells in production, and is not tested on animals. Each contains 20g of pea protein, coconut oil, potato starch, and uses beetroot juice to \u201cbleed\u201d a meaty red hue. On a smaller scale, the Beyond Burger will also go on sale in London\u2019s Honest Burgers chain alongside beef and chicken options. Beyond Meat boasts that its product is stocked on the chilled meat counter alongside animal products at 8,000 US grocery stores. It is also on the menu at more than 10,000 restaurants. \u201cThis strategy has proven extremely successful in the US, where we are now selling millions of burgers every month, and we are optimistic we\u2019ll see a similar positive reaction in the UK,\u201d said Seth Goldman, the Beyond Meat executive chairman. \u201cWe see the growing global demand for delicious, plant-based proteins and are excited to serve that demand in the UK.\u201d As more Britons drop meat from their diet for health or ethical reasons, manufacturers and retailers have been scrambling to cater for them. However, Goldman said the company was deliberately targeting the UK\u2019s estimated 22 million \u201cflexitarians\u201d \u2013 those who enjoy meat but want to reduce their consumption \u2013 as well as vegans and vegetarians. Goldman said that since Beyond burgers\u2019 US launch in January 2017, there had been more inquiries and interest from the UK than any other country outside America. \u201cThe UK is a priority market for us \u2013 a tremendously exciting one with huge potential and this is just a start,\u201d he added. The UK launch follows Beyond Meat\u2019s rise in the US, where the Los Angeles-based start-up attracted investment from Twitter founders Biz Stone and Evan Williams, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, former McDonalds chief Don Thompson and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Tyson Foods, the largest US meat processing company, acquired a 5% stake in the company. The first Beyond burgers sold out within an hour when they were launched in May 2016 in a store in Colorado. The manufacturer has recently tripled its factory and production space in Columbia, Missouri, to meet rapidly growing demand for the Beyond burger as well as other \u201clookalike\u201d meat products including sausages and chicken strips. Last week Sainsbury\u2019s bolstered its vegan and vegetarian food offering by putting on sale two new plant-based products \u2013 burgers and mince \u2013 in the fresh meat aisles of 400 of its larger stores. They are made by Naturli\u2019 Foods, which says it has struggled to keep up with demand since their January launch in Denmark. Meanwhile, frozen food giant Iceland will in September follow its popular meat-free No Bull burgers, launched in April, with a new range of alternatives which include a \u201cno-chicken chicken\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Food retailing seems to have turned into a game of choose a partner, or as boardrooms would see it, an exercise in high-level manoeuvring. Here comes Tesco, using Nato-style language to unveil its \u201clong-term, strategic alliance\u201d with Carrefour of France, complete with three-year \u201coperational framework\u201d to guard against corporate secrets falling into the wrong hands. All it is really talking about is combining buying clout to demand lower prices from suppliers. Grand strategic talk is in fashion in the age of Amazon. Retail executives talk of the industry evolving into a handful of global alliances, as happened with national airlines. Walmart is spending $16bn (\u00a312bn) to buy the Indian e-commerce leader Flipkart. In the UK, Sainsbury\u2019s will also enter the orbit of the US retailer if the Asda merger is approved by the Competition and Markets Authority. Out in China and south-east Asia, there\u2019s Alibaba, the local answer to Amazon. Meanwhile, Aldi and Lidl are already global players. The Tesco/Carrefour deal creates a new sphere of influence. It is too soon to speculate about a formal merger between Tesco and Carrefour, but such a script is clearly possible if the buyers cohabit happily. Tesco was long ago forced to abandon its go-it-alone approach to global expansion after flopping in the US and China. Getting cosy with Carrefour, a company with which it competes only in eastern Europe, sounds safer from the point of view of shareholders. The open question is who loses from the process of organising food sourcing into a handful of leading global chains. Big consumer goods companies such as Nestl\u00e9, Coca-Cola, Unilever and Kraft Heinz are the official targets, since they achieve 15%-plus profit margins while the supermarket trade gets by on about 3%, which is the nub of why Sainsbury\u2019s thinks it should be allowed to combine with Asda. Yet the share prices of big branded companies are not obviously trembling in fear of a retailers\u2019 revolt. The market thinks Unilever et al will be perfectly able to look after themselves if the fighting over prices turns rougher. If so, the worries should be for small suppliers and providers of own-label products. Selling to a retailer that sees itself as a part of supranational alliance, created to find supply chain \u201cefficiencies\u201d, sounds like a very tough gig for them. Tesco, like Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda, swears blind that local producers aren\u2019t in its sights and that small businesses should think fondly of the opportunities to sell to a bigger customer. Treat that claim with scepticism. Life has rarely worked out pleasantly for the little folk when the squeeze is on. McDonnell has got his wish over Vedanta Goodbye Vedanta Resources, you will not be missed. The Indian-owned mining company arrived on the London stock market in 2003, a low point in the City\u2019s rush to welcome all-comers and not ask too many tricky questions about corporate governance. The early years were unproblematic since it was hard not to make good money in the boom years for commodity producers. For the past eight years, however, Vedanta has disappointed its minority shareholders, whose frustrations have not been eased by a tangled corporate structure. Aside from most of a copper mine in Zambia, the London-listed entity owns 50.1% of the Indian-listed Vedanta Ltd, causing endless quarrels over the fair allocation of debt and dividends. Anil Agarwal, the Indian commodities billionaire whose family trust owns 66.5% of Vedanta Resources, is offering to buy out the minorities at 856p a share. The price looks superficially decent in the sense that it is 27.6% above Friday\u2019s close. On the other hand, the premium is only 13.6% if you take a three-month average. The key event in that period was the killing by Indian police of 13 people protesting against the extension of a copper smelter in the Indian town of Tuticorin, which prompted Labour\u2019s John McDonnell to call for Vedanta to be delisted to \u201cprevent further reputational damage to London\u2019s financial markets from this rogue corporation\u201d. McDonnell has got his wish, although the timing is entirely dictated by Agarwal\u2019s desire to simplify the corporate structure. But the shadow chancellor is basically right in his analysis: Vedanta and London was always a poor mix.",

On the other hand, the premium is only 13.6% if you take a three-month average.</p> <p>The key event in that period was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/28/india-copper-plant-sterlite-vedanta-shut-down-deadly-protests\">killing by Indian police</a> of 13 people protesting against the extension of a copper smelter in the Indian town of Tuticorin, which prompted Labour\u2019s John McDonnell to call for Vedanta to be delisted to \u201cprevent further reputational damage to London\u2019s financial markets from this rogue corporation\u201d.</p> <p>McDonnell has got his wish, although the timing is entirely dictated by Agarwal\u2019s desire to simplify the corporate structure. But the shadow chancellor is basically right in his analysis: Vedanta and London was always a poor mix.</p>",
