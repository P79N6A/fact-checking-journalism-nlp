    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne faced fresh questions about the credibility of his austerity policies just days before the budget on Wednesday night, when Fitch became the second of the major credit ratings agencies to warn that the UK's coveted AAA-rating is at risk. Echoing the recent decision by Moody's to place the UK on so-called \"negative watch\", which signals that it could be stripped of AAA status, Fitch said a weaker than expected recovery in the economy could jeopardise Osborne's chances of tackling the debt burden. The announcement came just a day after the chancellor floated the idea of selling 100-year bonds to take advantage of current high demand for the UK's bonds. In a statement released after the London markets had closed on Wednesday, Fitch warned that the UK had, \"very limited fiscal space to absorb further adverse economic shocks in light of such elevated debt levels and a potentially weaker than currently forecast economic recovery\". It said there was now a \"slightly greater than 50% chance\" that the UK would be stripped of its AAA-rating over the next two years. Analysts at Fitch highlighted the eurozone debt crisis \u2013 and the risk that the supply capacity of the economy has suffered permanent damage as a result of the credit crunch \u2013 as risks to the government's tax and spending forecasts. But the Treasury stressed that the other threat to the AAA score highlighted by Fitch was \"discretionary fiscal easing\", a decision by the government to abandon its deficit-cutting strategy. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"A week from the budget, this is a reminder of why it is essential Britain sticks to its plans to deal with its debts. This is just another warning to anyone who believes there can be deficit-financed giveaways in next week's budget.\" Osborne, who is in Washington this week with the prime minister, David Cameron, is likely to use this latest shot across the government's bows by the bond markets to strengthen his hand in seeing off demands for handouts in next week's budget. Osborne has already signalled that if as many analysts expect the deficit is lower than forecast, he will bank the extra cash instead of spending it. The actions of the powerful credit ratings agencies have come under growing scrutiny by politicians around the world since the financial crisis. Standard and Poor's, the third major agency alongside Moody's and Fitch, downgraded the US economy last summer, unleashing chaos on financial markets \u2013 although the Treasury is keen to point out that the cost of borrowing for the US government has not risen sharply as a result. Other countries, including France and Austria, have since faced downgrades. Fitch said the UK's debt levels were at the limit of what it would usually consider to qualify as a AAA country, although it added that quantitative easing, the Bank of England's policy of buying government bonds to help boost the economy, was helping to lower the cost of borrowing for the Treasury.",

Even the NHS, which the government swears blind it has ringfenced from its spending cuts, has had to get rid of 31,000 staff. Less than two years since they moved into Downing Street, David Cameron and George Osborne have managed to hack the public sector to its smallest since the summer of 2003. To talk of these as \"job losses\" is almost misleading. The phrase implies that these workers have been chucked on the dole through unfortunate circumstances, but nothing could be further from the truth. These redundancies form part of a project: David Cameron came in vowing to shrink the public sector as part of his mission to rebalance the economy. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that the coalition has made only 6% of its planned cuts to current public spending \u2013 voters and workers have the other 94% still to look forward to. Cameron thinks that making these job losses will help bring the deficit under control. But more broadly, the Conservatives believe that government uses resources \u2013 tax money, workers, even loans \u2013 that should go towards businesses. As Osborne put it in his first budget, back in June 2010, the state is \"crowding out private endeavour\". Well, the cuts have delivered plenty of pain all right \u2013 but the gain is much harder to see. Over the past year, the public sector has lost 270,000 jobs while the private sector has gained only 226,000: hardly the promised economic renaissance. And as Duncan Weldon, an economist at the TUC points out, \"Where the new jobs are being created is not where they are being lost\". You can see what he means in yesterday's breakdown of the jobs figures. They show that the north-east has an unemployment rate higher than Bulgaria's \u2013 with over one in 10 out of a job. The south-east on the other hand has a lower jobless rate than Germany. In his first major speech as prime minister, Cameron rightly observed: \"Our economy has become more and more unbalanced, with our fortunes hitched to a few industries in one corner of the country.\" Yet the evidence is that he has made Britain's even more lopsided, by pushing through a historic programme of cuts without any counterbalancing growth strategy \u2013 especially for that vast swath of the country north of Watford. At this rate, even if the coalition's bets for a turnaround by 2015 come off, it will have delivered an economy that is recovered but unreformed.",

Occupy demonstrators once held a mock trial convicting Goldman of financial crimes against humanity and on numerous occasions protesters descended on the Goldman building, chanting and carrying signs denouncing the company, at times resulting in arrests. For many Occupiers, Goldman typifies exactly what the movement seeks to address; the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of an elite few, maintained through indefensible means. Jeff Smith, an Occupy Wall Street activist, told the Guardian: \"Goldman Sachs represents everything that's wrong with the financial industry.\" He was dismissive of the Goldman director's motivations. \"He's yearning for the day when Goldman and their clients worked together to rob other people,\" Smith said. \"The fact of the matter is that this entire industry is designed to take advantage of people that have less information and less capital at their disposal. It's predatory at its core.\" Smith was skeptical of the 12 years it took the former executive to come to his conclusions: \"I think that if you have a real moral compass, that it wouldn't take you that long.\" Smith saw the op-ed in part as illustrating the success of Occupy's impact on the public impression of the finance industry. \"If there is shame, if there is guilt starting to emerge in these guys, that's Occupy Wall Street's contribution. \"The fact that he wrote this certainly fundamentally corroborates everything we've been saying.\"",

Questions were immediately raised about the relationship between the firm and its clients \u2013 whom the departing employee, Greg Smith, said were described as \"muppets\" by his superiors. Smith, who was based in London, made a savage attack on the culture of Goldman, which only two years ago was damaged by another London-based banker, Fabrice Tourre, who described creating \"Frankenstein\" products that showed scant regard for the needs of the firm's clients. Smith's public resignation letter made reference to the Tourre affair, as well as to the infamous description of Goldman in Rolling Stone magazine as \"a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity\". Smith said that none of these incidents had taught the firm any humility or integrity. He wrote: \"It makes me ill how callously people [at the bank] talk about ripping their clients off. Over the last 12 months I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as 'muppets', sometimes over internal email.\" Smith reckoned the fast track to a promotion involved persuading clients to invest in stocks or other products \"that we are trying to get rid of because they are not seen as having a lot of potential profit\". \"Today, if you make enough money for the firm (and are not currently an ax [sic] murderer) you will be promoted into a position of influence,\" he wrote. Smith described himself as an executive director and head of the firm's US equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He is thought to have been the only person in that department and was a vice-president, which some City sources suggested might be a disappointment after 12 years with the firm. Goldman wanted to get clients to trade \"whatever will bring the biggest profit to Goldman\" \u2013 a strategy referred to as \"hunting elephants\". \"You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the junior analyst sitting quietly in the corner of the room hearing about 'muppets', 'ripping eyeballs out' and 'getting paid' doesn't exactly turn into a model citizen,\" wrote Smith, who said he had been selected to appear in a recruitment video and in 2006 had managed the summer intern programme in New York for sales and trading. Goldman Sachs was quick to deny the accusations levelled by Smith, but may face an uphill battle in clearing its name with clients, which range from governments to major international companies and big players on the financial markets. It was reported that publishers were trying to track down Smith to offer him a book deal. Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat peer and his party's former Treasury spokesman in the Lords, said he would table questions to seek clarity on any relationship between the UK government and Goldman. He said: \"We know in the City that Goldman help themselves before their clients. Now here's the proof. Greg Smith says you get promoted there if you make enough money for the firm and you are not an axe murderer - and the people of Greece and the rest of the eurozone are paying the price after Goldmans cooked their books and Greece joined the euro at an unsustainably high exchange rate. Until this culture is stamped out, Goldman are not fit and proper to receive a penny of British taxpayers' money or advise our government in any way.\" Goldman advised Labour on the nationalisation of Northern Rock and acts as an official market marker of UK government bonds, known as gilts. Goldman alumni can be found in US political circles: the US Treasury secretary at the time of the banking crisis was Hank Paulson, who quit as boss of Goldman to take up the role in the Bush administration. Smith reckoned much had changed since Paulson quit, and the current bosses, chief executive Lloyd Blankfein and president Gary Cohn, were appointed. The pair had \"lost hold of the firm's culture on their watch\", during which time Blankfein once blurted that he was doing \"God's work\". Smith yearned for the previous culture \u2013 \"the secret sauce that made this place great\" \u2013 which had been about \"teamwork, integrity, a spirit of humility, and always doing right by our clients\". Blankfein and Cohn issued a joint statement from New York, where a new head of public relations, Jake Siewert, a White House press secretary during the Clinton administration, was installed only three days ago. \"In a company of our size, it is not shocking that some people could feel disgruntled. But that does not and should not represent our firm of more than 30,000 people,\" said the statementby the pair, who were told by Smith that he said he wanted his public resignation to be \"wake up call\". Smith's own career prospects might now be in doubt despite him boasting of his full scholarship from South Africa to Stanford University, selection as a Rhodes Scholar national finalist, and bronze medal for table tennis at the Maccabiah Games in Israel. David Way, a headhunter at Marks Sattin, reckoned these anecdotes read like a CV. But, Way noted: \"like most of the City's major employers, Goldman Sachs have a strong network of alumni running companies across the world who could be bosses or clients for high-level professionals changing jobs.\"",

      "bodyText": "The CBI is screaming blue murder, but Vince Cable is right: shareholders need a binding vote on pay. The belief that mere advisory votes could give owners real influence over boardroom rewards now appears quaint. But that was the hope when the system was introduced in 2003 and shareholder groups issued seemingly robust statements about holding boards to account. In practice, all that happened was pay schemes became more complex and levels of pay rose much faster than share prices and dividends. By the time the advisory vote arrived, the sums had already left the building. In the very few cases where a company lost an advisory vote, boards promised to do better next time but explained they were powerless to rewrite contracts, even in cases of executive failure. Cable's proposals are a big improvement. Shareholders would get a binding, forward looking vote on remuneration policy and the threshold for approval could be set as high as 75%; there would still be an advisory vote on the implementation of the policy; and there would also be a binding vote on any payoffs above a year's basic salary. The CBI's big beef is with that 75% hurdle. In a few cases, it's true that a single large shareholder (think Sir Stelios as easyJet) could hold a trump card. But, come on, well-drafted legislation could deal with that wrinkle. It's not as if requirement for a 75% majority is entirely novel. It already applies to all \"special\" resolutions that cover, for example, changes to the articles of association. Common sense says the relationship between owners and their appointed agents, as expressed through pay and incentives, also fits the description \"special\".",

      "body": "<p>The CBI is screaming blue murder, but Vince Cable is right: shareholders need a binding vote on pay.</p> <p>The belief that mere advisory votes could give owners real influence over boardroom rewards now appears quaint. But that was the hope when the system was introduced in 2003 and shareholder groups issued seemingly robust statements about holding boards to account.</p> <p>In practice, all that happened was pay schemes became more complex and levels of pay rose much faster than share prices and dividends. By the time the advisory vote arrived, the sums had already left the building. In the very few cases where a company lost an advisory vote, boards promised to do better next time but explained they were powerless to rewrite contracts, even in cases of executive failure.</p> <p>Cable's proposals are a big improvement. Shareholders would get a binding, forward looking vote on remuneration policy and the threshold for approval could be set as high as 75%; there would still be an advisory vote on the implementation of the policy; and there would also be a binding vote on any payoffs above a year's basic salary.</p> <p>The CBI's big beef is with that 75% hurdle. In a few cases, it's true that a single large shareholder (think Sir Stelios as easyJet) could hold a trump card. But,&#xa0;come on, well-drafted legislation could deal with that wrinkle. It's not as if&#xa0;requirement for a 75% majority is entirely novel. It already applies to all \"special\" resolutions that cover, for example, changes to the articles of association.</p> <p>Common sense says the relationship between owners and their appointed agents, as expressed through pay and incentives, also fits the description \"special\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Investors have strongly criticised George Osborne's controversial plan for 100-year gilts, branding them a gimmick and a \"lousy investment\". The chancellor will announce plans in next week's budget for the government's Debt Management Office to test the appetite for extending the length of government bonds to 100 years or into perpetuity. Pension funds would be the most likely investors in such long-term assets but they were among the first to dismiss the idea. Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: \"A 100-year bond would be too long for most pension funds, and we don't think that many would buy them. Even if a 100-year bond were attractive in duration, there would be a question mark over whether it would yield a strong enough return for investors.\" Interest rates are at record low levels because the Bank of England is buying up gilts as part of the quantitative easing programme. Average 10-year gilt yields stand at 2%, the lowest borrowing level since the 19th century. Ros Altmann, director general of Saga and a pensions expert, said: \"The Bank of England has artificially rigged interest rates lower and now the government is thinking of locking people into these artificially low rates for a century or forever. \"It's a bit of a gimmick. It's a macho symbol the chancellor might want to issue to say: 'Look how much confidence the markets have got in us, that they are willing to lend us money for so long, at such low rates.' \" Pension funds might, however, be forced into buying the 100-year gilts to meet regulatory requirements, owing to a lack of suitable, risk-free alternatives. Neville Hill, head of European economics at Credit Suisse, said: \"The reason people need to buy these assets is because that is what regulations require them to do. That is how the UK has managed down its very large debt ratios in the past. In some sense, the cost of financing the government is falling on the shoulders of pension funds and their pensioners. That's one of the advantages of being a sovereign: you make the laws.\" A trader calculated that \u00a3100 invested in a 100-year bond issued in 1912, which paid 3.4% interest, would yield \u00a32,931 over a century. That is way below inflation, which would have seen \u00a3100 balloon to \u00a38,870. Mark Dowding, senior portfolio manager at hedge fund BlueBay Asset Management, said: \"If you'd invested in a 100-year gilt 100 years ago, it would have been a lousy investment. You are taking a very big bet that there won't be any inflation at any point in the next 100 years. You could argue that in issuing this gilt there is a greater incentive for the Treasury to create more inflation and inflate away the value of the debt in real terms.\"Other countries have issued 100-year bonds recently. Mexico issued $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) of government debt in October 2010, which matures in 2110, and has outperformed the market. Dowding said: \"That has received investor demand so there's no reason why a UK gilt couldn't also trade well. The deal would get done. Would I want to buy it? I don't think I would.\"",

The bakery chain's chief executive Ken McMeikan blamed sluggish recent trading on a drop in high street footfall as consumers stayed away from the shops rather than risk overspending. It was not a \"black and white\" picture, he said but while trading in London was \"resilient\", its shops in other parts of the country were finding the going tougher, with like-for-like sales running down 1.8% this year. To win over value-conscious customers Greggs is offering keen deals such as two sausage rolls for a \u00a31 as well as \"no frills\" baguettes for the same price in around half its 1,500 stores. \"It's too early to say if this slower start is a sign of a more prolonged trend in sales,\" added McMeikan. His comments came as the baker reported a small increase in profits to \u00a353.1m on sales of \u00a3701m. The tough climate has not deterred the retailer from pressing on with aggressive expansion with another 90 stores set to open this in 2012. \"We don't see the high streets as dying, we see it as changing and presenting good growth opportunities for Greggs,\" added Mc Meikan. Last year the retailer tested the appetite for a Greggs branded coffee shop and the company said the pilot store in its native Newcastle has been well received. Another three will open this year with McMeikan throwing down the gauntlet to rivals such as Starbucks and Costa Coffee, claiming its coffee, sandwiches and cakes were up to 50% cheaper.

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable is putting the onus on shareholders to crack down on executive pay by handing them controversial fresh powers to vote down pay schemes at 1,200 quoted companies. Publishing a consultation on plans to hand investors a controversial binding vote on pay, the business secretary said: \"I want shareholders to feel empowered to prevent rewards for mediocrity or failure.\" The proposals, which suggest raising the threshold for a remuneration policy to be passed beyond a simple 50% majority, would require legislation and would not come into force until October 2013. The proposals are already facing criticism from employers' body the CBI which is warning that giving shareholders such powers puts them at risk of \"micro-managing\" businesses while unions, who want employee representatives on remuneration committees, believe they do not go far enough. Cable, though, reckons the \"call for action has been loud and clear\". He is proposing that the current advisory vote on previous remuneration \u2013 introduced by Labour in 2003 \u2013 is maintained but that binding votes are put in place for any payoffs that are greater than one year's salary, and on how the remuneration policies will be set in the future. Increasing the level of support required on votes on future pay policy is also considered while companies will be required to publish how shareholders voted in the past. But in 2011, no FTSE 100 company had its remuneration report voted down by more than 50% of its investors, but five companies would have failed to pass the vote had 75% approval been required \u2013 two of these had endured rebellions in the previous year. If a company fails to win the support of 75% of investors on the advisory vote, it would be required to issue a statement explaining within 30 days how it intends to change its policies. The paper acknowledged that some existing service contracts for directors will need to be rewritten to avoid the situation where departing executives can be handed more than one year's salary in any payoff. \"Good corporate governance is vital to creating the right environment for long-term, sustainable growth.

      "body": "<p>Should you rise from the underground, step off a train from Cambridge, or pass en route from Paris to Edinburgh next week, have the decency to gaze up at the reincarnated London's King's Cross station. After five years of construction the new western concourse is all but complete: a smaller but equally elegant counterpoint to its neighbour, St Pancras International.</p> <p>Network Rail has restored and preserved Victorian facades but added a stunning modern roof, creating an uninterrupted space springing from one plume of white steel - and all without, as the company stresses, cancelling one train.</p> <p>The wow factor in the \u00a3500m redevelopment is a \"diagrid\" roof - the kind seen atop the British Museum's Great Court, but in this case spanning 150m with not one visible bolt in the entire structure. Designed to cover the largest area without the need for supporting columns in the middle, this vast bright space is \"the head of a matchstick\", the engineers explain. The steel piles underpinning the visible lattice are driven 50m into the ground.</p> <p>Architect Hiro Aso, who has been part of the project with architects John McAslan since submitting their winning design in the late 1990s, says: \"It leaps, it's glorious, organic - a very bold expression of the overlay of new and old. We could have been a bit more apologetic, or subordinate, but this is an absolutely amazing structure.\"</p> <p>After the cramped conditions that have faced the 47 million passengers who use the station each year, the revamp promises not only free flow but perhaps even time to relax. An elevated second storey in the concourse will have cafes and shops more detached from the commuter rush. The biggest pub of any railway station will also now be found here: a boon for many awaiting the evening East Coast services, if not perhaps the cleaning staff or guards.</p> <p>Although wooden passages of construction hoardings have funnelled passengers through to the western platforms and St Pancras for years, many were utterly oblivious of the transformation taking place behind the boards, according to project manager Ian Fry. \"We've held presentations for people here showing what we're doing, and they frequently ask: 'So when are you going to start?'\"</p> <p>Clearer light has already been falling on the eastern platforms, the main train shed, since the first sections of its glass roof were recently completed.</p> <p>Photovoltaic panels will generate 10-20% of the station's power needs. That work continues, and after the Olympics builders will start pulling off the scabrous eyesore, the \"dingy green canopy\" (as Network Rail's own literature describes it) that hangs over the present entrance.

      "bodyText": "Should you rise from the underground, step off a train from Cambridge, or pass en route from Paris to Edinburgh next week, have the decency to gaze up at the reincarnated London's King's Cross station. After five years of construction the new western concourse is all but complete: a smaller but equally elegant counterpoint to its neighbour, St Pancras International. Network Rail has restored and preserved Victorian facades but added a stunning modern roof, creating an uninterrupted space springing from one plume of white steel - and all without, as the company stresses, cancelling one train. The wow factor in the \u00a3500m redevelopment is a \"diagrid\" roof - the kind seen atop the British Museum's Great Court, but in this case spanning 150m with not one visible bolt in the entire structure. Designed to cover the largest area without the need for supporting columns in the middle, this vast bright space is \"the head of a matchstick\", the engineers explain. The steel piles underpinning the visible lattice are driven 50m into the ground. Architect Hiro Aso, who has been part of the project with architects John McAslan since submitting their winning design in the late 1990s, says: \"It leaps, it's glorious, organic - a very bold expression of the overlay of new and old. We could have been a bit more apologetic, or subordinate, but this is an absolutely amazing structure.\" After the cramped conditions that have faced the 47 million passengers who use the station each year, the revamp promises not only free flow but perhaps even time to relax. An elevated second storey in the concourse will have cafes and shops more detached from the commuter rush. The biggest pub of any railway station will also now be found here: a boon for many awaiting the evening East Coast services, if not perhaps the cleaning staff or guards. Although wooden passages of construction hoardings have funnelled passengers through to the western platforms and St Pancras for years, many were utterly oblivious of the transformation taking place behind the boards, according to project manager Ian Fry. \"We've held presentations for people here showing what we're doing, and they frequently ask: 'So when are you going to start?'\" Clearer light has already been falling on the eastern platforms, the main train shed, since the first sections of its glass roof were recently completed. Photovoltaic panels will generate 10-20% of the station's power needs. That work continues, and after the Olympics builders will start pulling off the scabrous eyesore, the \"dingy green canopy\" (as Network Rail's own literature describes it) that hangs over the present entrance. For a few last days the ageing concourse behind, remains the main point of departure. Next year it will be demolished to make way for an outdoor plaza. The most frequently asked question, Network Rail bosses admit, is the location of platform nine and three-quarters, boarding point for the Hogwart's Express of Harry Potter fame. Despite the station's reconstruction the monument, a luggage trolley vanishing into the brickwork, has kept tourists queuing - even when relocated to a dismal exterior wall on the accident blackspot of York Way junction, a setting to challenge the most ardent JK Rowling fan's suspension of disbelief. A new space will be found amid the renovation of the original 1852 building - but discreetly, not between platforms nine and 10, and facing away from any trains lest the incessant flash photography unsights the drivers.",
