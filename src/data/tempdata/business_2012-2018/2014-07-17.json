      "bodyText": "Eddie \"Lord\" Davenport, the serial fraudster best known for promoting the notorious Gatecrasher Ball events popular with public school pupils in the 1980s, has been ordered to pay almost \u00a314m in fines and compensation or return to jail for a further 10-year sentence. The ruling comes almost three years after Davenport, who despite past affectations does not hold a peerage, was sentenced to seven years and eight months in jail for \u00a34.5m of loan frauds, preying on scores of small businesses in desperate need of finance between 2005 and 2009. His sentence was later reduced and he was released from prison two months ago. At the heart of Davenport's fraudulent business activities had been a 24-room townhouse on Portland Place, the only substantial recoverable asset prosecutors have been able to trace to him. Under Davenport's ownership, the house hosted celebrity parties and a \"upmarket\" swinger event called Killing Kittens. It was used as the venue for music videos, including Amy Winehouse's Rehab, a location for films such as The King's Speech and for Kate Moss's Agent Provocateur fashion shoot. Three years ago, a US drinks business converted one room into a giant Courvoisier-filled punchbowl as a publicity stunt. It has taken the Serious Fraud Office three years to convince the courts that proceeds from Davenport's fraudulent activities were used in the unorthodox purchase of the building. The house had previously been the Sierra Leone high commission until Davenport controversially acquired it for a below-market sum in 1999 while the west African country was in the middle of a civil war. He will now be under pressure to sell the property in order to avoid further time in jail. Judge Testar, who also presided at Davenport's lengthy trial, said on Thursday: \"For some four years I have had a deep sense that moving matters along in the case has been a truly Sisyphean task, both before during and after the trial \u2026 In the end I have decided that the risk of Mr Davenport retaining some of the fruits of his crime is one that my public duty dictates I should not take.\" A confidence trickster, Davenport surrounded himself with what appeared to be the trappings of wealth: a Monaco address, a garage full of luxury cars and a wardrobe packed with Savile Row suits. He also cultivated an image as a risqu\u00e9 figure on the fringes of high society and the celebrity circuit, a regular in gossip columns. Bogus accounts, glossy brochures and adverts in the Financial Times added to the impression of credibility. Davenport and his accomplices also adopted a string of aliases. Desperate businesses, unable to get loans from their banks, turned to Davenport's firm Gresham, which had been masquerading as a loan provider with a reputable track record.

    "webTitle": "British banks braced for new inquiry as competition watchdog prepares report", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's banks are braced for an inquiry into competition on the high street to be signalled on Friday when the competition watchdog reports on its latest views on the industry dominated by big four players. Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC have an 80% share of the market for current accounts and small business banking, two areas that have been subjected to recent reviews by the competition authorities. The Competition and Markets Authority, the new competition watchdog, will report back on those and is expected to launch a consultation through the summer that could herald a full-blown investigation in the autumn. The CMA has already been asked to look at competition in the energy sector by Ofgem, an area Labour leader Ed Miliband has been targeting along with the banking sector. The government has also been focusing on increasing competition in the sector by relaxing rules to make it easier for new banks to be set up. The business secretary, Vince Cable, is also keeping up the pressure on RBS to speed up the process of creating a new challenger bank for small business customers by spinning out 314 of its branches under a new brand. Cable called on RBS to accelerate the reintroduction of the Williams &amp; Glyn name \u2013 a brand last seen 30 years ago \u2013 on the high-street branches which the EU ordered it to sell at the time of its 2008 taxpayer bailout. But the fascia is yet to appear above any of the branches in question. In contrast, Lloyds Banking Group has resurrected the TSB name for the 631 branches it was forced to spin off and has started the process of a stock-market flotation. Cable's latest intervention, in a letter to the RBS boss, Ross McEwan, came before the announcement by the CMA and amid heightened political scrutiny of banks. It is expected to signal the 10th competition investigation in the sector in 15 years. The largest market shares are held by the two bailed-out banks. As recently as last year the Office of Fair Trading, a predecessor body to the CMA, concluded the number of branches they were spinning off did not need to be increased to enhance competition. The revival of W&amp;G aims to create more competition in the small and medium-sized (SME) business sector, which Cable is keen to see. In his letter, the business secretary told McEwan: \"I believe there is a case for greater clarity about the path to divestment. The most important statement in this regard \u2013 particularly for the public \u2013 would be the rebranding of branches as Williams and Glyn, and I would be grateful to hear what steps you could take to accelerate this element of the process. \"Williams and Glyn has the potential to be an important challenger in the small business market in particular and therefore many, including me, are anxious to see it in operation as soon as possible,\" he wrote. The banking industry has been facing the possibility of a competition investigation since 2011, when Sir John Vickers' independent commission on banking recommended one take place in 2015. Vickers also recommended the creation of a switching service for current accounts. The service began in September last year and bankers hope it will stall any investigation into personal current accounts.",

Just as content providers don't want to forfeit pricing power to the owners of distribution infrastructure, so the same logic applies in reverse. BT, for example, has marched onto Sky's patch by buying sports content. A Liberty/ITV deal would seem to present few regulatory obstacles. Access to ITV channels on fair terms would obviously have to be guaranteed, and ITV's regional news coverage would have to be protected. But neither requirement would be a deal-killer. The speculation was enough to push ITV's shares up 6% to 195p. That looks a reasonable assessment of the uncertainties. Liberty, having said it has no current intention to bid, is now forbidden from instigating a move for six months. But, as a long-term idea, Virgin/ITV is clearly a possible combination. And, if we know anything about Malone, it's that he does deals. His own shareholders probably deserve to know if anything is regarded as off limits these days.",

      "bodyText": "Mothercare's loss-making UK chain is old fashioned and needs a complete overhaul, according to the new boss of the specialist retailer. Mark Newton-Jones, whose appointment was confirmed earlier this month, was frank in his assessment of the domestic chain which in recent years has struggled to compete with the march of the supermarkets into the specialist mother and baby market. \"In the UK, my early observation is that the business needs modernising and requires investment in its infrastructure, its stores and head office systems,\" he said. \"As a result many of the retail practices need updating, when we compare ourselves to more modern retailers.\" His assessment made grim reading for investors given Newton-Jones' predecessor Simon Calver, who left after a disastrous Christmas trading performance, embarked on a turnaround in 2012. The shares fell nearly 9% to 255p on the prospect of more heavy lifting. The stakes are high for Newton-Jones as earlier this month the retailer rebuffed a \u00a3266m takeover bid from US rival Destination Maternity. Mothercare argued the 300p a share offer undervalued the company and its prospects. The company refused to comment on the likelihood of the US company, which wants to get its hands on Mothercare's successful overseas business, returning with a higher offer before the July 30 deadline. Instead Newton-Jones used the trading update to set out the themes of a turnaround that involves weaning customers off promotions and thrashing out better deals with suppliers. He also plans to cut costs, improve customer service and introduce more upmarket product ranges. It was \"too early\" to put a figure on the cost of implementing his vision and whether it would have to ask shareholders for money to fund them, he said. Under Newton-Jones, who joined as interim boss in March, the performance of its UK chain has started to improve with like-for-like up nearly 1% in the 15 weeks to 12 July. Online sales were down more than 6% as it ran fewer promotions but the company said the sales it did make were more profitable. Sales at its large international business also picked up pace with like-for-likes ahead 14.7%. Conlumino analyst Mark Piner said it was a \"make or break year\" for Mothercare with Newton-Jones risking his reputation on the retailer \"at the most pivotal time in its history\". \"Mothercare has a lot to do if it is to have any hope of reigniting enthusiasm for its brand at home,\" he said. The turnaround comes at a tumultuous time in sector with specialist website Kiddicare sold to turnaround investors Endless for a nominal \u00a32m this week while upmarket Mamas and Papas chain is reported to be struggling amid fierce price competition. Morrisons is effectively paying Endless a dowry to free itself of the business it bought for \u00a370m for in 2011 as it retains responsibilty for the leases on 10 loss-making Kiddicare stores, having set aside \u00a3163m to cover costs associated with exiting the venture earlier this year.",

      "bodyText": "My colleague Alan Yuhas is tracking events in Ukraine in a new live blog: Malaysia Airlines plane crashes in Ukraine - live So I'm going to wrap thing up here. Reminder, our afternoon summary is here. GW My colleague in Moscow, Sean Walker, is covering the Malaysia Airlines flight: A passenger jet has reportedly crashed in eastern Ukraine in an area where separatist rebels have been engaging Ukrainian army forces in recent weeks. The Malaysia Airlines plane, travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, apparently had 295 people on board and crashed near the town of Snezhnoe, according to a report from Interfax news agency which could not immediately be confirmed. A source in the Russian aviation industry told Reuters that the plane did not enter Russian airspace when expected and had indeed crashed in eastern Ukraine. In recent days the Ukrainian air force has lost planes in the area after they have been shot down by rebels. Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine accused Russia of downing one of its fighter jets inside Ukrainian territory. Malaysia Airlines plane crashes in east Ukraine, reports say Sean will be updating his story with the latest information as it happens. There are unconfirmed reports from Ukraine and Russia that a Malaysia Airlines aircraft has crashed near Donetsk this afternoon. The Boeing 777, flight MH17, was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpa, carrying up to 295 people. The Interfax news agency is reporting that it was \"shot down\" at 10km over eastern Ukraine, but that's not been officially confirmed by any other sources at this stage. Video footage is circulating that does show plumes of smoke, but again, at this stage there is no official confirmation. Here is Reuters early take: A Malaysian passenger airliner with 295 people on board crashed in Ukraine near the Russian border on Thursday, the Interfax news agency cited an aviation industry source as saying. The Boeing plane was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, it said. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The Interfax report said the plane came down 50 km (20 miles) short of entering Russian airspace. It \"began to drop, afterwards it was found burning on the ground on Ukrainian territory,\" the unnamed source said. The plane appeared to have come down in a region of military action where Ukrainian government forces are battling pro-Russian separatists. A separate unnamed source in the Ukrainian security apparatus, quoted by Interfax, said the plane disappeared from radar at a height of 10,000 metres after which it came down near the town of Shakhtyorsk. The news hit airline shares, with British Airways owner IAG sliding 3% in late trading. Shares in Moscow have tumbled today after America announced new sanctions against Russian banks, energy producers and defence firms. After a day of heavy selling, the RTS index of leading companies has closed down 3.8%, its lowest level since the end of May. The MICEX index shedding 2.3%. Companies hit by the sanctions, including energy firms Rosneft and Novatek, led the fallers. They, like the Gazprombank and Vnesheconombank, have been blocked from accessing the US capital markets for medium-and long-term borrowing. The ruble also weakened by 1%, to around 35 rubles to one US dollar. The Russian government has hit back against America. President Putin warned that the sanctions would hurt US companies, and drive relations between the two sides into a dead end. Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev claimed the sanctions were \"evil\", and would fuel anti-US feeling in Russia. Analysts have predicted that the sanctions will cause financial headaches for the companies. Dmitri Petrov of Nomura says: The listed firms will find it difficult to attract financing for new projects, with the Rosneft and Exxon joint exploration in Arctic being among the primary concerns. The companies will also find is much more costly to roll over their debt in hard currency, particularly the USD as US financial institutions are now prohibited from financing these entities. Novatek, though, insisted that its projects in the Arctic would not be affected by the restrictions. Two business groups have expressed concerns over the sanctions, which are designed to deter Russia from helping separatists in Ukraine and to help broke a lasting peace deal in the region. The tensions pushed down markets world wide, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Unrest in Ukraine has been bubbling away in the background for months but while oil and natural gas exports were unaffected it has been largely ignored by stock markets. It appears though that the US and Europe are determined to keep the pressure on Russia who they believe is aiding separatist efforts in the east of Ukraine. Given Russia have denied aiding separatists from the start and in fact accuse the US of sending special forces to help the Ukrainian military, there seems little chance of progress. Russian President Putin has described relations with the US as approaching \u201ca dead end\u201d. Here we go, via Oksana Kobzeva of Reuters' Moscow bureau. Russia's central bank said on Thursday that the impact of U.S. sanctions over the Ukraine crisis would largely have a delayed impact and that it had enough tools to address short-term difficulties. \"The main consequences relate to the acquisition of new long-term loans or refinancing - that is, the effects are largely of a delayed nature,\" it told Reuters. It did not specify a timeframe. Newsflash from Moscow: RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK SAYS U.S. SANCTIONS WILL LARGELY HAVE DELAYED IMPACT. More shortly (hopefully...) Shares on Wall Street have dipped in early trading, as the Russian sanctions weigh on the market. But really it's pretty quiet. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 20 points, or 0.12% Microsoft's share price has jumped 3%, though, as traders welcome the news that it's slashing up to 18,000 jobs \u2013 markets showing their caring side, as ever. In London, the UK government has denied that Europe is dragging its feet over Russian sanctions. While Washington has hit specific Russian banks, energy companies and defence firms with sanctions, EU leaders decided to draw up a list of potential targets by the end of July. Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a Westminster news briefing that Western leaders are united: \"You have from the outset seen the EU and US working closely on this, in nearly all cases making announcements about further action in a very similar timeframe in a way that demonstrates the desire to keep working together on a very similar path. \"I think you are seeing a pretty consistent message now from the EU and US that, because Russian words are not being matched by Russian actions on the ground, further measures are following.\" Back to Russia, and European business groups are crying foul over the sanctions announced last night. Germany's trade association, BGA, fears that Russia will hit back with sanctions of his own, in a \"spiralling\" tit-for-tat scenario. Jens Nagel of the BGA told Reuters: \"I wouldn't put it past President Vladimir Putin to impose retaliatory measures to save face, as was the case after the first level of sanctions.\" The Association of European Businesses, a lobby group, has claimed that 'European investors' disagree with the sanctions (a rather sweeping claim, frankly). It also hints that the Obama administration is being cute, with sanctions \"more focused on the partners of the European businesses than on the partners of American companies.\" Those job cuts are dreadful news for thousands of Microsoft employees; Wall Street, though, doesn't worry about that. MS are tipped to rise today, to a new 14-year high. America's labour market continues to improve, but its housing market has stumbled. That's the message from the latest economic data hitting the wires. The good news is that the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell by 3,000 last week to 302,000, a better reading than expected. The four-week average of claims fell to 309,000, the lowest since June 2007 (the dawn of the financial crisis). But.... the number of new housing starts (where a builder begins work on a new home) slumped by 9.3% in June. And the number of permits for new builds slipped by 4.2%, a sign that America's housing market struggled last month. Big news out of America -- software giant Microsoft has just said it will eliminate up to 18,000 positions over the next year, the biggest cull in its history. We'd been expecting Microsoft to announce job cuts today, but this goes much further than predicted (there was talk of 6,000 jobs being cut) Around 12,500 of the jobs cuts are related to the integration of Nokia's handset business, which Microsoft bought last year. CEO Satya Nadella, who took over five months ago, said the cuts will also deliver \"work simplification\". What does that mean? Slashing management layers, for one. Nadella told staff in an email that: As part of modernizing our engineering processes the expectations we have from each of our disciplines will change. In addition, we plan to have fewer layers of management, both top down and sideways, to accelerate the flow of information and decision making. This includes flattening organizations and increasing the span of control of people managers. In addition, our business processes and support models will be more lean and efficient with greater trust between teams. Microsoft currently employs 127,000 people, having acquired around 25,000 employees through the Nokia deal. Here's a video clip of President Putin responding to the new sanctions this morning; he argued they will hurt US interests in Russia, and push relations between the two countries to a \"dead end\". Just in -- Novatek has insisted that US sanctions won't scupper its operations. Having seen its shares pummelled this morning, the gas producer hit back against claims that it will struggle to finance its work in the Arctic. It pledged to take the \"necessary measures\" to push on with its major projects. RUSSIA'S NOVATEK SAYS U.S. SANCTIONS DO NOT HINDER ITS PRODUCTION AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY NOVATEK SAYS MAJOR PROJECTS WILL GO AHEAD AS PLANNED NOVATEK SAYS WILL TAKE \"NECESSARY MEASURES\" FOR FINANCING ITS LNG* PROJECTS WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS * - Liquid natural gas Novatek is partnered with France's Total, and CNPC of China, to exploit LNG reserves in the Arctic. Despite this pledge, though, Novatek's shares are still down almost 9%. Ian Bremmer, president and founder of the risk consultancy Eurasia Group, fears that the new US sanctions will not achieve their objectives: Investors continue to pile out of Novatek, Russia's second-largest gas supplier. It's shares are now down 8.9% today, making it the biggest casualty of the new sanctions. The oil price has been pushed up today, following predictions that Rosneft et al could struggle to raise funds for new Arctic exploration. A barrel of US crude oil is up $1.1 per barrel, to $102.32, while Brent crude rose $0.6 to $107.79. Warren Ruhomon, analyst from finspreads.com, sums up the mood on the Moscow stock market: \u201cThe new round of sanctions against Russia from both the US and EU has hit the Russia equities hard today. The RTS Index, the benchmark stock index has fallen by 4% whilst the Moscow stock index (MICEX) has slumped 2.9% in trading as investors moved to downsize risk in Russian stocks on the back of the tougher sanctions. Of course, the main concern here is that this creates a new wave on uncertainty as to what the implications of these new sanctions will mean, and how the situation could escalate.\u201d The Russian market has already underperformed European counterparts. The MICEX is down almost 5% this year; the FTSEurofirst 100, which tracks major companies across the region, is up 3.5% since the start of 2014. Dmitri Petrov, analyst at Nomura, says Russia's energy giants face financial headaches, and could struggle to raise funding for new exploration programme: Here's a flavour of Petrov's latest research note: The listed firms will find it difficult to attract financing for new projects, with the Rosneft and Exxon joint exploration in Arctic being among the primary concerns. The companies will also find is much more costly to roll over their debt in hard currency, particularly the US dollar as US financial institutions are now prohibited from financing these entities. Rollover wise, Rosneft is most affected with $13.6bn due to be repaid this year, Gazprombank has $1bn in December, the others have no repayments this year. But that's not all... A much more severe impact comes from the signalling implications that have spillover effects for the general economy. Foreign banks in the US and Europe will become much more concerned about credit risk exposure to Russian enterprises, increasing funding costs and in some cases refusing to provide funding all together. There is an additional impact for Russian tradable assets, which will once again become more volatile as the market will likely read into the political headlines more carefully, taking the tail risk of third level sanctions more seriously. (via FT Alphaville's Markets Live) The Russian ruble has continued to weaken this morning, hitting its lowest level against the US dollar since early June. Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev's comments about anti-US feeling and defence spending helped to push the ruble down to just over 35 rubles to $1. The US government appears to have timed these new sanctions on Russia's energy firms rather well. A few weeks ago, the oil price was being driven up by the insurgency in Iraq. Now, though, prices are back at their lowest point in two months. This means companies like Rosneft have less leverage, says Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale strategist Regis Chatellier: \"From the West's perspective they could not have chosen a better time to intensify sanctions,\" \"Until a few weeks back Russia was in a position of relative strength because there was massive pressure on oil but that is not the case any more.\" UK oil firm BP, which owns a 20% stake in Rosneft, says it is studying the impact of the new sanctions on its Russian ally. Because those sanctions focus on blocking Rosneft's access to dollar funding, they shouldn't have an immediate impact on supplies. Breaking away from Russia, the latest economic data from Europe adds to concerns that its economy is faltering. Construction output across the eurozone fell by 1.5% in May, compared with April, led by a substantial dip in activity in Germany. Eurostat reports: The largest decreases in production in construction were observed in Germany (-4.9%), Poland (-3.9%), Slovenia (-3.7%) and the Czech Republic (-3.6%), while increases were registered in Hungary (+2.3%), Bulgaria (+1.7%), Slovakia (+1.6%) and Spain (+1.0%). The data is seasonally adjusted, so may reflect the impact of the mild winter in Europe. German building firms, for example, were able to keep working in months where they'd normally be forced to down tools for bad weather. That supported economic growth in the first few months of 2014, but may mean the construction sector is now fading - just as factories also report a fall in production.... Russian shareholders are dumping stock in fears that America will launch a third wave of sanctions in future, says Timothy Ash, head of emerging markets at Standard Bank. Ash told clients this morning: \"Investors will be asking which Russian companies will be next and what assets and financing will be subject to further sanctions,\" \"If you are subsequently caught up in further U.S. sanctions actions against Russia, it is clearly your own fault.\" Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has now highlighted just how unhappy Moscow is about the new sanctions, saying that are \"evil\" and will fuel anti-US feeling in Russia. In an ominous sign, Medvedev said that Moscow should pay more attention to its defence spending, and claimed that the new crackdown would not do Ukraine any good. RUSSIAN PM MEDVEDEV SAYS SANCTIONS HAVE NEVER BROUGHT ANY COUNTRY TO ITS KNEES, CALLS MEASURES 'EVIL' PM MEDVEDEV SAYS SANCTIONS WILL FUEL ANTI-U.S. SENTIMENT, SEES A RETURN TO THE '1980S' PM MEDVEDEV SAYS SANCTIONS WON'T HELP IMPROVE SITUATION IN UKRAINE, SEES NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO DEFENCE SPENDING And those comments are pushing shares down in Moscow, with the RTS index now down 4%.... The selloff is gathering pace in Moscow. The RTS stock index (which includes many of Russia's biggest companies) has fallen by 3.7% so far today. Gas producer Novatek has tumbled by 6.7%, in response to the news that it is hit by the latest US sanctions. And VTB Bank, whose CEO warned of devastating consequences this morning, has now fallen by 3%. And the MICEX index (which includes many of the same companies as RTS) is now down 2.7%. Europe's stock markets have all dipped this morning, as investors fret about the consequences of relations between Russia and the West worsening. It's not a major selloff, though -- the FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC are all down 0.2%. Michael Hewson of City firm CMC Markets explains that: investors are focussing back on the latest announcement of new US and EU mandated sanctions against Russia over their role in the unrest in the Ukraine, as tensions rise once again. Russia's third-largest bank, Gazprombank, says it's still operating as normal today. Reuters reports: The bank added it was working normally, serving all its clients' needs, including operations via international payment systems. Gazprombank is the financial arm of energy giant Gazprom. The new sanctions block US firms from providing any medium-or long-term funding to it. One of Russia's leading bankers has also hit out, claiming the latest sanctions announced by Washington will hurt the global economy. Andrei Kostin, who runs Russia's second largest bank, VTB, argued the new restrictions on Russian financial and energy firms are disproportionate. According to the Itar-Tass news agency, VTB chief executive Kostin said: \"Of course, these sanctions are inappropriate and of course they do not correspond to the spirit or the legal standards of existing international relations, in particular in the field of finance and banking,\" \"I believe that if we do not take measures to stop such unilateral actions, we could see devastating consequences for the global financial system.\" Washington may conclude that this means the new restrictions have teeth; just what Barack Obama wanted to achieve. Last night, the US president declared that Russia must: halt the flow of weapons of fighters across the border into Ukraine; urge separatists to release hostages; support a ceasefire; pursue internationally mediated talks and agreed to meaningful monitors on the border. VTB Bank's shares are down 2.7% this morning. Russia's foreign ministry has hit back at Brussels this morning. It says it is disappointed that the EU had: \"succumbed to the blackmail of the U.S. administration and, contradicting its own interests, followed the path of sanctions\". We don't know exactly what the EU will impose on Moscow, yet.... At last night's summit, European leaders agreed to draw up a list of companies and people to be hit with asset freezes. Officials wouldn't speculate on whether energy companies like Gazprom or Rosneft could be included. Russian government bonds are weakening this morning; another sign that the latest sanctions from the US may bite. \u2022 RUSSIA SOVEREIGN 2020, 2030 DOLLAR BONDS FALL 1.5 CENTS AFTER US SANCTIONS City traders report that the cost of insuring Russian debt, using a credit default swap (CDS), has also risen this morning: The Russian ruble has weakening this morning, losing 0.75% against the US dollar in early trading. One dollar is now worth 34.86 rubles, compared to 34.64 rubles last night. Shares in oil giant Rosneft tumbled over 4.5% this morning, making it one of the biggest fallers in Moscow: Other big fallers include diamond producer Alrosa, gas supplier Novatek, and the Sberbank bank. Rosneft, Novatek, and the other companies targeted by the US, will no longer be able to access medium- and long-term dollar funding. The US assets of eight Russian defense firms Washington appears to be trying to hurt Russia's largest energy suppliers without causing too much impact to the wider energy markets. Reuters explains: The new sanctions would not appear to prevent Rosneft from selling its oil, but may raise questions about the company\u2019s more than $15 billion worth of oil-related finance arrangements with companies including BP, which now owns almost a fifth of Rosneft, and Glencore. There was an early rush of selling on the Moscow stock market, as this graph of the MICEX this week shows: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. World stock markets are edgy this morning after the US ratcheted up the pressure on Moscow, with a new swathe of sanctions for supporting Ukrainian separatists. The Russian stock market has already been hit, falling over 2% at the start of trading as investors reacted to the news that Washington has escalated the pressure on Russia. The ruble is under pressure too, dropping in early trading. The US is now targeting major banks including Gazprombank, and defence firms and energy companies including Rosneft, as we reported last night: [Treasury secretary Jack] Lew imposed sanctions that prohibit US firms from providing financing to two major Russian banks: GazpromBank, the financial arm of gas supplier Gazprom, and Vnesheconombank, or VEB, a state-owned bank. The same sanctions have been applied to two Russia\u2019s largest energy firms: Rosneft, an oil producer, and Novatek, another natural gas supplier. US significantly escalates sanctions against Russia over Ukraine Europe has also hardened its approach, agreeing to sanction Russian firms destabilising Ukraine, and also blacking new lending to Russia (more here). The new sanctions are likely to drag markets down across Europe, heightening fears that the growing tensions between Moscow and the West could hit the global economy. More details and reaction to follow, along with other key developments through the day.",

      "bodyText": "The chairman and three other board members of the Financial Conduct Authority faced calls to quit on Thursday because of conflicts of interest related to the ongoing investigation into the collapse of HBOS. The FCA chair, John Griffith-Jones, recused himself from board meetings to discuss the eventual report into the circumstances surrounding the rescue of HBOS by Lloyds TSB in September 2008, because his previous employer, KPMG, had acted as auditor to the troubled bank. The other directors also caught in a conflict of interest are the head of enforcement, Tracey McDermott, the head of supervision, Clive Adamson, and the chief operating officer, Lesley Titcomb. They worked for the FCA's predecessor, the Financial Services Authority. The directors are part of the 12-member board of the City regulator, which was holding its first public meeting since it was created in April 2013. Philip Meadowcroft, a member of the public and long-time campaigner over such issues, said: \"As four members ... have admitted conflicts of interest as far as dealing with HBOS and cannot take a normal role in board meetings, surely the only way forward to begin to rebuild essential trust in the FCA board is for these conflicted board members to resign and be replaced by new members who are not tainted by a prior connection with the collapse of HBOS.\" The investigation report was long overdue, he said, because the regulator had said a year ago that Maxwellisation - the process that allows individuals mentioned in a report to see extracts relating to them in advance - was due to begin, but had yet to happen. Last week the FCA was forced to reopen its investigation, which has examined \u2013 following pressure from the Treasury select committee \u2013 whether former HBOS management team members should be banned from working in the City. Griffith-Jones asked the non-executive director Sir Brian Pomeroy, who is overseeing the HBOS report, to respond. Pomeroy said \"nothing was being hidden\" and that the report should be published at the end of the year. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, later acknowledged that any further delay in publication caused by a decision concerning former HBOS directors would be \"a concern to everyone\". He said that more big fines could be expected after a flurry of penalties for Libor rigging, for which two or three more cases were pending, and for mistreatment of customers. \"The capacity of the industry to surprise with bad conduct is something that is a concern to us,\" Wheatley said. He added that the use of lawyers' letters, sent out by banks and other firms in attempts to get unpaid loans settled, was a \"live issue\". Wonga has recently been ordered to pay \u00a32.6m compensation for sending letters to customers appearing to come from legal firms which do not exist. MPs have also criticised Lloyds Banking Group for sending letters from legal firms to recover debts. Wheatley said the FCA was gathering more information about the use of such letters. He said the remaining Libor cases, first blown into public view in June 2012 when Barclays was fined \u00a3290m and when the regulator said another seven firms were being investigated, were not as serious as those concerning the six firms already punished. \"They weren't as serious as the cases we took first. There are complications where it has become clear we are not just looking at Libor and in some cases the need to co-operate with other agencies ... Our resources are not unlimited. We prioritise the cases,\" Wheatley said. Criticism was also aimed at Adamson, who gave a selective media briefing at the end of March to discuss a wide-ranging review of the insurance market, which led to a drop in share prices across the sector and prompted Legal &amp; General to issue a stock market statement to demand clarity from the regulator. The FCA has commissioned a review into the briefing, which is not yet completed.",

      "bodyText": "England's early exit from the World Cup cost Sports Direct up to \u00a320m in lost profits, the group said, as disappointed football fans failed to buy replica shirts. Dave Forsey, chief executive, said the lacklustre performance of Roy Hodgson's team in Brazil was much more significant to the business than a dispute with Adidas which meant Sports Direct could not stock replicas of the on-field strips of teams including the winners Germany and the runners-up Argentina. The brand has pulled stock from a number of different retailers, because it was unhappy at the presentation of goods or customer service. \"England's early exit meant a \u00a310m to \u00a320m swing to [underlying profits],\" Forsey said. \"It's all about England for the World Cup for our stores. What affects sales primarily will always be how long England lasts in the tournament.\" While Sports Direct revealed a healthy 15.6% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3239.5m on sales of \u00a32.7bn, up 23.8% in the year to 27 April, driven by strong sales of sportswear as well as the acquisition of fashion chain Republic, Forsey said performance would have been better if the England team had hit the back of the net more often. However, Forsey said Sports Direct was hopeful of stocking the main Adidas football strips it wants, including Premier League team Chelsea's after \"encouraging discussions\" with the sports brand which stopped supplying certain strips to Sports Direct this year. Forsey was not able to confirm if and when Adidas might begin supply but he said:\"Top-level engagement has been encouraging for the last couple of weeks and both teams see opportunities for their side.\" Sports Direct is also seeking a rapprochement with shareholders after a bruising battle over the bonus scheme which would have significantly benefited the chain's founder, Mike Ashley. On Wednesday, the company said Ashley had chosen to withdraw from the scheme, two weeks after it had been approved. The move was widely welcomed by major institutional shareholders who felt the bonus arrangements were inappropriately structured. They want Ashley, who owns a 58% stake in the company but does not receive any pay for his role as executive deputy chairman, to be rewarded by a salary or a dividend that would benefit all investors. Shareholders had threatened to vote against the re-election of the chairman Keith Hellawell and some non-executive directors, but Forsey said their protests had not affected Ashley's decision. \"That was all around staff. He wouldn't want the team to feel that he was taking over shares and they would lose out. That was the only reason he came to his decision,\" Forsey said, adding that only the Sports Direct's board would decide when it is appropriate to pay a dividend. \"We have always stated that we will use the cash we have got for future growth opportunities. If there comes a point that there aren't those future opportunities then the board would consider ways of returning cash to shareholders,\" he said. For now, Sports Direct is upgrading its stores as part of the strategy to woo back Adidas and continues to look at acquisitions, although Forsey declined to comment on whether the company is interested in a bid for footwear chain Office, a move it previously said was not possible because of its disagreement with Adidas.",

      "bodyText": "The annual meetings of Britain's leading companies have prompted a number of shareholder revolts this summer, including a hat-trick of rebellions against the serial boardroom director Sir John Peace, who chairs three FTSE 100 firms \u2013 Standard Chartered, fashion retailer Burberry and credit-checking company Experian. Heads have not rolled this year, unlike the \"shareholder spring of 2012\" when several chief executives were ousted, including the bosses of the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and the insurer Aviva. There is, however, deeper scrutiny of executive pay after the business secretary, Vince Cable, allowed shareholders a new binding vote on future remuneration for executives last October. Next Thursday, Royal Mail will hold its first annual meeting in Birmingham following its controversial float last autumn. The Commons business, innovation and skills committee said in a scathing report last week that taxpayers lost out on \u00a31bn because the government and its City advisers underpriced the postal service's privatisation. Shareholders may also ask questions about a potentially hefty fine from French competition authorities investigating possible anti-trust violations at Royal Mail's parcel delivery subsidiary. The brewer SABMiller, telecoms firm TalkTalk and Carphone Warehouse also have shareholder meetings next week. Carphone Warehouse is holding an extraordinary meeting, during which investors are expected to back its merger with Dixons. The shareholder advisory group Pirc has advised investors to oppose SABmiller's remuneration policy, arguing that chief executive Alan Clark's maximum potential payout was \"highly excessive\" as it was far above the acceptable limit of 200% of his salary. Pirc has also called on TalkTalk shareholders to vote against both the remuneration report and policy, noting that the company's boss, Dido Harding, received variable pay equal to 1,255% of her base salary last year, including a bonus and long-term incentive award granted in 2010, 40% of which vested the same year. Vodafone, which has had stormy meetings in the past, holds its annual general meeting the following week, on 29 July. Rounding off the AGM season, Sports Direct faces the wrath of shareholders on 10 September. Leading investors have threatened to vote against the re-election of the chairman and other board members who they think are weak and haven't acted in the best interests of all shareholders. The board came under fire for pushing through a multimillion-pound bonus scheme for Sports Direct's founder, Mike Ashley, which he pulled out of this week. AstraZeneca \u2013 24 April The drugmaker, which has since successfully fended off an unwelcome takeover approach from its US rival Pfizer, suffered a major shareholder revolt at its AGM. Around 40% of investors failed to back its remuneration report and 31% refused to support its proposed pay policy for the next three years. Two years ago, the then chief David Brennan was forced to quit after a row over his \u00a39m pay deal and a long period of worsening performance at Britain's second-biggest pharmaceuticals firm. Barclays \u2013 24 April One in three Barclays investors refused to back its pay plans, in a bloody nose for the bank over its decision to raise bankers' bonuses by 10% despite a 32% fall in profits.

Investors said the bank failed to consult them properly about new bonuses for its chief executive, Peter Sands, and other top executives. Morrisons \u2013 5 June The former chairman of the supermarket chain tore into its boss, Dalton Philips, at Morrisons' AGM. In an extraordinary public tirade, which drew loud applause from hundreds of private shareholders, Sir Ken Morrison described Philips's strategy as bullshit and warned that the business founded by his father had been ruined. Shareholders also registered a significant protest vote against the management team that presided over a 27% fall in the FTSE 100 company's share price in the year leading up to the AGM. The results showed 15.4% voted against Philips's re-election, 12.3% opposed the re-election to the board of the chairman, Sir Ian Gibson, and 26.5% voted against the pay policy. Tesco \u2013 27 June At a bad tempered shareholder meeting, small investors turned out in force to accuse the management of arrogance and having lost shoppers' trust. They pointed to the retailer's worsening financial performance and slumping share price. All the resolutions were passed with little dissent, however. Only 1.14% of votes cast opposed the re-election to the board of Tesco's chief executive, Philip Clarke. Burberry \u2013 11 July The fashion house faced a huge revolt over pay with almost 53% of investors voting against its pay report, after it handed its new chief executive, Christopher Bailey, a one-off award of shares worth nearly \u00a315m last year. While the vote was non-binding, Peace, the Burberry chairman, acknowledged that the board would have to \"reflect on that and talk to shareholders\". Before the AGM, a chorus of investor groups including Pirc and the Investment Management Association expressed concerns about Burberry's pay policies. Icap \u2013 16 July At the interdealer broker run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, one in three investor votes were cast against the remuneration report. Investor bodies were concerned about bonuses at the money broker, which was fined \u00a355m in September for rigging Libor. The company's chairman, Charles Gregson, responded to concerns by promising to consult them on a new design of the policy in 2016.

The FTSE 100 has fallen 19.52 points to 6765.15 as the US and EU unveiled tougher sanctions against Russia over the situation in Ukraine. Traders fear the move could put further pressure on the global economy as it struggles to recover from the downturn. Talk of a possible bond default in China has added to the uncertainty. ITV however has jumped to the top of the leaderboard as John Malone's cable group Liberty Global - which owns Virgin Media - bought a 6.4% stake in the broadcaster from BSkyB for \u00a3481m. Despite Liberty saying it did not intend to make an offer for the rest of ITV, its shares have jumped 13p to 196.8p. Investec analyst Steve Liechti said: Liberty Media share acquisition implies take-over speculation is now likely to be a key part of the investment case, even though Liberty has confirmed that it has no intention to bid (with an implied 6 month moratorium under Takeover Panel rules). Given recent Liberty Global M&amp;A appetite, we see speculation of further M&amp;A as almost inevitable mid-term implying ITV shares are likely to be valued more on a take-over basis. But Meggitt, lifted on Wednesday by suggestions that United Technologies could be interested in a bid for the engineering group, has fallen back 10.5p to 526.5p. Imperial Tobacco, up 63p at \u00a326.93, and British American Tobacco, 21.5p better at \u00a335.30, were both lifted as investors shied away from risk and sought defensive stocks. Elsewhere Rexam has dropped 16.5p to 520p as Deutsche Bank moved its recommendation on the packaging group from buy to hold, albeit raising its price target from 550p to 570p. The bank said: We see limited upside to the stock at current levels. While we think earnings will benefit significantly from outsized performance in LatAm in 2014, we believe this expectation is largely priced in to the stock. Moreover, we have concerns about the rising aluminium premium in Europe, which Rexam currently is unable to pass through to customers. We are adjusting our model to reflect a more accurate first half/second half earnings split and a rising aluminium premium. The company also reportedly has a 6.79% exposure to Russia, so the sanctions news was bound to hit sentiment. Car dealer Inchcape is down 5.5p at 621.5p, since the country is a key market for luxury vehicles. Mike Ashley's Sports Direct International - never far from the headlines - has fallen 11p to 702.5p as it reported full year underlying profits up 20% to \u00a3249.3m, slightly below expectations.

      "bodyText": "The owners of the petrochemicals plant in Grangemouth, the future of which was in doubt last year, have won a \u00a3230m loan guarantee from the UK government to build a new facility to import shale gas. Ineos said the project would protect thousands of jobs across the country and ensure the long-term future of the site. The loan guarantee will allow it to raise funds to invest in a new terminal at Grangemouth to import, store and process ethane from shale gas, as North Sea supplies dwindle. The site was threatened with closure last year, but was saved after a dramatic climbdown by the Unite trade union, which accepted drastic changes to staff working conditions. In return, Ineos said it had invested \u00a3300m as part of a long-term survival plan for Grangemouth to manufacture petrochemicals beyond 2017. The company's chairman, Jim Ratcliffe, said: \"Without doubt, this is one of the most important projects of recent times in Scotland, with implications to be felt right across the UK, not only for employment but also for manufacturing in general. \"Our ability to import US shale gas underpins the future of manufacturing at Grangemouth and across many businesses in Scotland. It is a vital step towards preserving the long term future of the Grangemouth site and those businesses that depend upon its continued presence in Scotland.\" The ethane tank will be the largest in Europe. It will be built by the specialist engineering company TGE Gas Engineering. By 2016, Grangemouth will be a shale gas-based facility, which Ineos said was essential if it is to compete in world markets beyond 2017. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said: \"Over \u00a31bn of infrastructure projects have now been brought forward as a result of the UK guarantees scheme and \u00a336bn worth of projects are pre-qualified. \"The Grangemouth guarantee is fantastic news for Scotland's economic future, and for the UK's energy security.\"",

In return, Ineos said it had invested \u00a3300m as part of a long-term survival plan for Grangemouth to manufacture petrochemicals beyond 2017.</p> <p>The company's chairman, Jim Ratcliffe, said: \"Without doubt, this is one of the most important projects of recent times in Scotland, with implications to be felt right across the UK, not only for employment but also for manufacturing in general.</p> <p>\"Our ability to import US shale gas underpins the future of manufacturing at Grangemouth and across many businesses in Scotland. It is a vital step towards preserving the long term future of the Grangemouth site and those businesses that depend upon its continued presence in Scotland.\"</p> <p>The ethane tank will be the largest in Europe. It will be built by the specialist engineering company TGE Gas Engineering. By 2016, Grangemouth will be a shale gas-based facility, which Ineos said was essential if it is to compete in world markets beyond 2017.</p> <p>The chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said: \"Over \u00a31bn of infrastructure projects have now been brought forward as a result of the UK guarantees scheme and \u00a336bn worth of projects are pre-qualified.</p> <p>\"The Grangemouth guarantee is fantastic news for Scotland's economic future, and for the UK's energy security.\"</p>",

The company, formerly known as Scottish and Southern Energy, blamed \"very competitive market conditions\" for the drop in electricity and gas customer accounts to 8.99m at the end of June, from 9.1m at the end of March. Most of its customers are dual fuel, which suggests at least 55,000 households have switched to a rival. In late March, SSE became the first of Britain's big six energy suppliers to freeze gas and electricity prices until 2016, having been the first to raise fuel bills last autumn, with a controversial 8.2% increase. Despite the fall in customer numbers, SSE said its financial outlook is unchanged from that set out in late May, with adjusted earnings per share this year expected to be around or \"slightly greater\" than last year's 123.4p. SSE warned it will get tougher to achieve increases in earnings in the following two years. The company reiterated plans for a dividend increase that \"at least keeps pace with RPI inflation\" for 2014-15. RPI inflation stands at 2.6%. The numbers were released ahead of the SSE's annual meeting in Perth, where it will update shareholders on the revamp of its business. SSE is shedding 500 jobs and splitting its retail and wholesale divisions. The company is likely to face questions from shareholders over the Scottish independence referendum in September. It previously said it was making arrangements to deal with the \"uncertainty\", while remaining neutral. Along with the other big energy providers, SSE faces the scrutiny of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), in the biggest investigation to date into the UK energy market. The watchdog is looking at whether SSE, British Gas and others have been profiteering at the expense of consumers and whether they should be broken up. The CMA is expected to publish its provisional findings in May or June 2015.",
