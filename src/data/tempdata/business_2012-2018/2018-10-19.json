      "bodyText": "Chinese officials have reacted quickly to a sharp slowdown in growth at the world\u2019s second largest economy, promising that it remained strong despite an escalating trade war with the US. The intervention on Friday by the vice-premier, Liu He, and the central bank governor gave China\u2019s leading stock market a brief respite from six months of tumbling shares that have sliced more than a third from the value of Shanghai-listed companies. Growth in the three months to the end of September slipped to 6.5% from 6.7% in the previous quarter, official data showed, to mark the slowest rate of quarterly GDP growth since early 2009. Much of the blame for the slowdown was heaped on Beijing\u2019s credit controls, which had restricted lending and investment, especially in heavy industries. Beijing tightened controls on lending last year to rein in a debt boom. That has weighed on housing sales and consumer spending. Car buyers are steering clear of dealerships. Credit controls and trade tensions were \u201ctaking a bite out of economic momentum\u201d, said Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group, in a report. China\u2019s economy was already before a tariff war between Beijing and Donald Trump erupted. European and US companies have seen orders fall, especially in the car sector, which has also faced severe falls in demand as customers turn away from diesel vehicles. Shares in the tyre maker Michelin tumbled more than 5% on Friday after it warned sales would worsen in the fourth quarter following weaker Chinese vehicle demand and new emissions standards that have hit European registrations. Official Chinese figures, which are much criticised for inflating China\u2019s real rate of growth, showed trade continued to play a positive role in boosting GDP growth, suggesting foreign orders for Chinese goods had surged ahead of tariffs being put in place. Analysts said this meant the impact of trade barriers had been delayed and once the full impact was felt could drag China\u2019s growth down further in subsequent quarters. Diana Choyleva, a director of the consultancy Enodo Economics and a China expert, said Chinese officials were wary of the US president and of antagonising him any further. She said the trade war with the US, which has seen Washington impose extra tariffs on more than $200bn of goods, would help push down the value of the yuan by 15-20% against the dollar, offsetting the impact of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cBeijing now understands that America is serious about containing China\u2019s rise, especially in technology, and at this stage would not want to risk giving Trump an excuse to turn tougher faster,\u201d she said. The impact of Trump\u2019s penalty tariffs of up to 25% on Chinese goods in a dispute over Beijing\u2019s technology policy has been limited. But with the rest of its $12tn a year economy slowing, the communist leadership has reversed course and ordered banks to lend. \u201cDownward pressure has increased,\u201d a government spokesman said. Chinese officials led by Liu helped push up the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index by 2.6% with claims that low-valued companies provided a buying opportunity. The decline is creating good investment opportunities, Liu said in comments carried by the official Xinhua News Agency. \u201cChina\u2018s current economic fundamentals are good,\u201d the central bank\u2019s governor, Yi Gang, said on its website. The Chinese government also said insurers would be allowed to create products to help stabilise the market by reducing \u201cliquidity risk\u201d. The plan refers to fears that banks and shadow banks, which have accepted stock as collateral for loans, might sell and flood the market, driving a stock market collapse. As well as retaliating against some US tariffs, Beijing has cut them in other areas, promised to lift curbs on foreign ownership of car producers and taken other steps to boost growth. But leaders have refused to scrap plans such as Made in China 2025, which calls for the state-led creation of Chinese champions in robotics and other technologies, which the US says breaks international trade rules.",

      "bodyText": "WPP is no longer the world\u2019s biggest marketing and advertising services group by market capitalisation after the UK company\u2019s stock market value slipped below that of US rival Omnicom for the first time in almost a decade. The London-listed company\u2019s share price has been slashed by a quarter over the past year and is languishing at levels not seen since 2012. The group, which has held the status of the world\u2019s most valuable advertising group since 2011, has seen its stock market value plunge to about \u00a313bn ($17bn) as it faces both internal and external crises. WPP\u2019s chief executive, Mark Read, is struggling to steady the ship after the abrupt departure of its founder, Sir Martin Sorrell. In addition, he is fighting to re-engineer the sprawling group as the digital advertising power of Google and Facebook grows, and advertisers increasingly question the benefits of giving their marketing spend over to traditional global holding companies such as WPP and Omnicom. In the space of a week, embattled WPP has lost three global assignments, including creative duties for Ford, a client for 75 years, as well as American Express and United Airlines. Omnicom has now overtaken WPP in terms of stock market value: it is worth $17.3bn, representing a remarkable, and symbolic, reversal of fortunes for the world\u2019s two biggest ad groups. As recently as 2014, WPP hit a record market cap of almost $30bn after a winning run that resulted in Sorrell earning more than \u00a3200m from pay, and lucrative \u2013 and highly controversial \u2013 reward schemes over a five-year period. During that time, WPP was worth as much as 50% more than Omnicom in market cap terms. \u201cWPP\u2019s value has collapsed in the last five years,\u201d said Alex DeGroote, an independent analyst. \u201cWPP has lost 60% of its value in the last two years. There has been stark value erosion. The market is hoping that new management can draw a line in the sand and reach a point [where] the share price won\u2019t drop any more.\u201d Last year the company reported its lowest level of growth since the advertising recession of 2009. Read, who took over WPP on an interim basis after Sorrell\u2019s departure in April, and was confirmed as chief executive in September, has rung the changes, merging some of its advertising networks to streamline the empire. The company employs more than 200,000 staff, in 400 separate ad businesses, in more than 3,000 offices in 112 countries. WPP has also opened talks to sell a stake in its China operation and started selling off stakes it holds in businesses such as AppNexus and Globant. WPP remains the biggest marketing services group in the world by revenues, at \u00a315bn annually. Last year, Omnicom reported $15bn in revenues.",

    "webTitle": "Post Office boss receives 7% pay rise as postmaster salaries cut", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Post Office boss Paula Vennells received a 7% pay rise last year, while thousands of postmasters took an average 4.5% pay cut. The former L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Argos executive took home \u00a3718,300 in the year to March, according to accounts filed at Companies House this week, while 11,500 Post Office workers \u2013 the vast majority of whom are self-employed \u2013 received a combined \u00a317m pay cut to \u00a3371m. Postmasters say falling pay combined with rising costs, such as business rates, is resulting in the closure of permanent post offices and a switch to temporary facilities run from vans or community centres. More than 1,500 of the 11,547 post offices in the UK are now temporary, 426 more than in 2014, according to Post Office data at the end of March collected by the House of Commons library. \u201cNet profits are being squeezed. We are seeing more and more post office businesses falling over,\u201d said Calum Greenhow, the chief executive of the National Federation of SubPostmasters. He said more than 400 post offices had closed in the last six months, although some of those are likely to reopen after being refurbished or moved. Some postmasters have written to the Guardian saying their fees are not sufficient to pay even the minimum wage for the number of staff required to open at evenings and weekends, when the public want access to post offices. They say it is not safe to leave one member of staff in charge of large amounts of cash. Tom Moran, the network development director at the Post Office, said the drop in pay for branches was the result of a gradual switch from fixed fees to variable payments for most, based on the number and kind of transactions they handle. About 3,000 offices in locations where they have community importance as the \u201clast shop in the village\u201d receive a set payment subsidised by the government, which is due to end by 2021. Before 2010 the majority of postmasters received a set fee from the government-backed business. But that is being phased out alongside a severe cut in subsidy from \u00a3210m in 2012 to \u00a370m in the year to March. Moran said that despite \u00a317m less going to postmasters last year, the Post Office had stabilised branch numbers at about 11,500 after years of decline, by offering financial help to develop retail businesses alongside counters handling mail and benefits. He said the introduction of new technology and ways of working had made running a post office more efficient. He said investment meant outlets could now be run with one person. \u201cWe believe we have got a competitive offer. The stability of the network is a good indication that what we are offering is there or there abouts,\u201d Moran said. He said Vennell\u2019s basic pay had only risen 1.9% and the rest of her \u00a346,700 jump in remuneration was the result of bonuses earned for hitting targets, including increasing profits and holding branch numbers steady. The Post Office announced a \u00a335m annual profit excluding exceptional items and subsidy, more than double the year before, while sales were steady at \u00a3961m. Moran said post offices were suffering from a general slowdown on the high street: \u201cRetail is going through a very tough time and we are no different to any other retailer. People are increasingly using online retail rather than going shopping.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/post-office\">Post Office</a> boss Paula Vennells received a 7% pay rise last year, while thousands of postmasters took an average 4.5% pay cut.</p> <p>The former L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Argos executive took home \u00a3718,300 in the year to March, according to accounts filed at Companies House this week, while 11,500 Post Office workers \u2013 the vast majority of whom are self-employed \u2013 received a combined \u00a317m pay cut to \u00a3371m.</p> <p>Postmasters say falling pay combined with rising costs, such as business rates, is resulting in the closure of permanent post offices and a switch to temporary facilities run from vans or community centres.</p> <p>More than 1,500 of the 11,547 post offices in the UK are now temporary, 426 more than in 2014, according to Post Office data at the end of March collected by the House of Commons library.</p> <p>\u201cNet profits are being squeezed. We are seeing more and more post office businesses falling over,\u201d said Calum Greenhow, the chief executive of the National Federation of SubPostmasters.</p> <p>He said more than 400 post offices had closed in the last six months, although some of those are likely to reopen after being refurbished or moved.</p> <p>Some postmasters have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/15/a-shared-passion-for-post-offices\">written to the Guardian</a> saying their fees are not sufficient to pay even the minimum wage for the number of staff required to open at evenings and weekends, when the public want access to post offices. They say it is not safe to leave one member of staff in charge of large amounts of cash.</p> <p>Tom Moran, the network development director at the Post Office, said the drop in pay for branches was the result of a gradual switch from fixed fees to variable payments for most, based on the number and kind of transactions they handle.</p> <p>About 3,000 offices in locations where they have community importance as the \u201clast shop in the village\u201d receive a set payment subsidised by the government, which is due to end by 2021.</p> <p>Before 2010 the majority of postmasters received a set fee from the government-backed business. But that is being phased out alongside a severe cut in subsidy from \u00a3210m in 2012 to \u00a370m in the year to March.</p> <p>Moran said that despite \u00a317m less going to postmasters last year, the Post Office had stabilised branch numbers at about 11,500 after years of decline, by offering financial help to develop retail businesses alongside counters handling mail and benefits.</p> <p>He said the introduction of new technology and ways of working had made running a post office more efficient. He said investment meant outlets could now be run with one person.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe we have got a competitive offer. The stability of the network is a good indication that what we are offering is there or there abouts,\u201d Moran said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said Vennell\u2019s basic pay had only risen 1.9% and the rest of her \u00a346,700 jump in remuneration was the result of bonuses earned for hitting targets, including increasing profits and holding branch numbers steady.</p> <p>The Post Office announced a \u00a335m annual profit excluding exceptional items and subsidy, more than double the year before, while sales were steady at \u00a3961m.</p> <p>Moran said post offices were suffering from a general slowdown on the high street: \u201cRetail is going through a very tough time and we are no different to any other retailer. People are increasingly using online retail rather than going shopping.\u201d</p>",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Scottish Power to invest in solar energy for the first time", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Scottish Power, one of Britain\u2019s biggest energy companies, has said it will invest in solar power for the first time as part of its move away from fossil fuels. The big six firm sold off its last gas-fired power stations to Drax Group this week to focus exclusively on renewables, which today consists of onshore and offshore windfarms. But Keith Anderson, the company\u2019s chief executive, told the Guardian he had decided to move into solar, too. \u201cThe solar market has had difficulties over the last wee while. But you look at where the technology cost is getting to, and the possibilities of integrating it with wind \u2026 how it balances from season to season wind and solar output, and we see a good opportunity there for further investment.\u201d Solar farms around the UK have historically been built by smaller energy firms and community groups, so the entrance of such a big player would mark a major shake-up. It could also inject life into a sector that has stalled in the face of subsidy cuts. Researchers have argued that the comparatively low wind output across Europe this summer because of hot, still weather was a reminder of why energy companies should be investing in solar as well as wind. Anderson said that Scottish Power had moved to 100% renewables because it was cheaper than other sources. \u201cWe need to invest in the cheapest forms of energy \u2013 that\u2019s onshore wind, offshore wind, it\u2019s going to be solar \u2013 and that will help drive down the cost of energy,\u201d he said. The world\u2019s need to tackle climate change also made it clear that companies needed to embrace green energy wholeheartedly, he said. \u201cLook at the IPCC report last week. My absolute belief is that organisations need to be at the forefront of that change. We can\u2019t be part of the problem, we have to be part of the solution.\u201d Scottish Power would be competing in an auction next summer for a slice of \u00a3557m in government subsidies for offshore windfarms, Anderson confirmed. The firm hopes to secure a contract for its planned 1,200MW East Anglia Three project, which would be capable of powering nearly 900,000 homes and dwarf the world\u2019s current biggest, a 659MW scheme off the Cumbrian coast. Anderson also expressed confidence that ministers were nearing a rethink on their block on subsidies for onshore windfarms, which the Conservatives barred when they came to power in 2015. \u201cWe\u2019re closer than we\u2019ve ever been before,\u201d he said. A poll this week found that two thirds of people living in rural Scottish communities, which are considered to have some of the best sites for prospective sites, support onshore windfarms. But the prospect for new gas power stations \u2013 which companies including Drax and Germany\u2019s RWE want to build \u2013 were bleak, Anderson said. \u201cRight now the commercial signals don\u2019t exist to build a new gas plant in the UK. That might change in the future, but it\u2019s not something we\u2019ll get involved in.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the today, here\u2019s a look at markets across Europe, where the FTSE continues to outperform: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,045 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 11,530 France\u2019s CAC: -0.9% at 5,073 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 18,956 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 8,901 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 361 While the mood among investors is distinctly subdued, the news this morning that China\u2019s economy grew by 6.5% in the third quarter - the slowest rate since the financial crisis - has not prompted a major sell-off. In the UK, figures showed the government borrowed \u00a34.1bn in September, less than the \u00a34.5bn predicted by economists and \u00a3800m than a year earlier. It was the lowest September borrowing figure since 2007, and potentially hands the chancellor more room for budget giveaways on 29 October. The big news this afternoon is that Nick Clegg is joining Facebook as head of global policy and communications. You\u2019ll find all the latest updates on the story here: That\u2019s all for today, we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Thank you for all the comments, and have a good weekend. As the shock news of Nick Clegg\u2019s Facebook appointment was breaking, the Treasury put out a response to this morning\u2019s lower than expected borrowing numbers. Does it provide any clues to what might be in the budget a week on Monday? If anything it suggests Philip Hammond is not prepared to splash the cash, despite a falling deficit this year. A Treasury spokesperson said: This is the lowest half-year borrowing for 16 years \u2013 showing the strong progress we have made in fixing our public finances. But, at over 85% of GDP last year, our debt remains too high. Our balanced approach is getting debt falling while supporting our vital public services, keeping taxes low and investing in Britain\u2019s future. Twitter is reacting to the news that Facebook has hired Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who lost his seat at the 2017 general election: Facebook\u2019s newest recruit is none other than Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister. According to the FT, he will join the social media giant as head its global affairs and communications team and will move to Silicon Valley in January. It follows months of wooing by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, who told Clegg,51, he would have a leading role in shaping the company\u2019s strategy. As Theresa May returns from Brussels with no Brexit deal, to major divisions in her own party and a people\u2019s vote march on Saturday, big business is also keeping up the pressure. In the latest intervention, the president of Japanese car maker Toyota has said a no-deal Brexit should be avoided \u201cat all costs\u201d. Noting the failure to agree a deal this week, Akio Toyoda said: Apprehension is therefore growing that a withdrawal without agreement may become a reality. It is necessary that an unimpaired trade environment between the United Kingdom and the European Union be maintained and that the automobile industry\u2019s activities remain predicated on shared standards, including those regulating vehicle certification. Toyota employs about 2,600 people at its manufacturing plant in Derbyshire, and a further 600 in Deeside. Read the full story here: He\u2019s the chief executive of a FTSE 100 housebuilder and his huge \u00a375m bonus payout - the biggest of any UK listed company - attracted widespread criticism earlier in the year. Yet Jeff Fairburn was lost for words when Spencer Stokes, a BBC journalist for Look North in Yorkshire, asked him about it during an interview. Asked if he has regrets about the furore surrounding his massive payout, Fairburn hesitates, before being interrupted by a press officer who is off camera. As Stokes persists with the line of questioning, Fairburn says: I\u2019d rather not talk about that, it\u2019s been well covered actually. Are there any lessons to be learned, it was the biggest bonus in the country, Stokes asks. At which point Fairburn walks off camera and says: I think that\u2019s really unfortunate actually that you\u2019ve done that. Watch it here: The latest figures on the UK\u2019s public finances have reinforced expectations that the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster will revise down borrowing for 2018-19. At the time of the Spring Statement in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility was forecasting borrowing to fall to \u00a337.1bn from \u00a345.2bn in 2017-18. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC: While there could be some catch-up in public spending later in the year, we still expect public borrowing in 2018/19 as a whole to be only around \u00a330 billion, which would be around \u00a37 billion less than the OBR forecast back in March. However, we shouldn\u2019t get too excited about budget giveaways, Hawksworth adds: This borrowing undershoot should give the chancellor a little extra wiggle room for his budget, but it will not be enough on its own to cover the cost of announced increases in spending on the NHS, let alone other priority areas where there is pressure to bring austerity to an end. The budget is therefore still likely to require some tough choices between net tax rises, higher borrowing in the medium term and allowing austerity to continue in parts of the public sector. The chancellor Philip Hammond may well have a spring in his step this morning, after the latest official figures show government borrowing fell more than expected in September. Borrowing was \u00a34.1bn last month, less than the \u00a34.5bn predicted by economists and \u00a3800m than a year earlier according to the Office for National Statistics. It was the lowest borrowing for the month of September since 2007 - shortly before the financial crisis hit. It means that halfway through the fiscal year, borrowing stands at \u00a319.9bn - \u00a310.7bn less than in the same period in 2017 and the lowest year-to-date for 16 years. It is the last set of data before Hammond presents his budget on 29 October. With Theresa May already declaring an end to austerity, could this be the chancellor\u2019s moment to pull a rabbit out of the hat with a surprise spending giveaway? Improvement in the public finances in September was driven by higher VAT and income tax receipts, and national insurance contributions. Not all businesses are reaping the benefits of consumer demand in China. New Look, the value high street fashion retailer, is exiting China, closing all 120 stores with the loss of more than 700 jobs. Corporate results this morning help to put into context slowing growth in China, where swelling middle classes continue to drive demand for luxury goods. The French spirits company, Remy Cointreau, reported stronger-than-expected second quarter sales, helped by robust demand for its premium cognac in China. Sales for the three months to 30 September were \u20ac330m, a like-for like rise of 9.1%. Meanwhile, the Intercontinental Hotels Group said it would pay $500 million to shareholders in a special dividend as it reported a 1% rise in revenue per available room for the third quarter, driven by strong demand in China. Investors across Europe are subdued as the week draws to a close. It\u2019s a mixed picture, with the FTSE outperforming its peers. On the flip side, the FTSE MIB is firmly in the red in Italy, where budget concerns continue to weigh on investor minds and are dragging down banking shares. The latest scores: FTSE 100: 0.3% at 7,047 Germany\u2019s DAX: flat at 11,588 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,111 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 18,876 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.5% at 8,847 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: flat at 362 Putting China\u2019s growth figures in context, Neil Wilson at markets.com says growth of 6.5% is \u201ca nice problem to have\u201d. Growth of 6.5% rather than 6.6% is a pretty nice problem to have but the trade war with the US, higher debt levels and a depreciating currency remain a concern. Any bounce in Chinese stocks needs to be seen in the context of the three-year collapse in equities. One of the weaker spots in China\u2019s economy was industrial production, with growth slowing to 5.8% year-on-year in September, from 6.1% in August. Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon, says: The slowdown makes sense in the context of the sharp downtrend in the manufacturing PMIs in recent months. The breakdowns available at this stage offer little sign of green shoots. In particular, cement production is falling again, though this could reflect environmental curbs, rather than suggesting that the construction sector is back in the doldrums, after its recent positive contribution. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China\u2019s economy grew by 6.5% in the third quarter according to official figures published this morning. It was the slowest rate since the depths of the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2009, and slightly below economists\u2019 forecasts of 6.6% growth. It followed growth of 6.7% in the second quarter, and the slowdown of the world\u2019s second largest economy is expected to continue as the effects of China\u2019s trade war with the US are increasingly felt. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, gives his take: Official GDP growth slowed last quarter consistent with broader evidence that the economy is cooling. There are some early signs in the September data that policy support is starting to gain traction, but we think more easing will still be needed in order to stabilise growth. Looking ahead, we doubt the latest pick-up in infrastructure spending will be enough to prevent the economy from cooling further in the coming quarters. Policy easing has yet to reverse the downward trajectory in broad credit growth, a key headwind to the economy, and front-loading by US importers means that the impact of tariffs has yet to be felt. We anticipate a further loosening of both monetary and fiscal policy in the coming months, which should put a floor under growth by about the middle of 2019. Also coming up today, UK public finance figures for September at 9.30am BST will provide insight into how much spending room the chancellor, Philip Hammond, might have ahead of his budget on 29 October.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell has ended its 12-year sponsorship of the National Gallery, to the delight of campaigners who have fought to keep fossil fuel financing out of the arts. The partnership with the Anglo-Dutch firm has made the London art gallery the target of protests over the years, including Greenpeace dropping a banner off the building\u2019s roof and activists gatecrashing the launch of a flagship Rembrandt exhibition. Campaigners have spent years putting pressure on national cultural institutions to cut their ties with fossil fuel firms, which they say gives the companies a social licence to operate and \u2018launders\u2019 their corporate image. They have already scored major victories, such as BP ending its 26-year relationship with the Tate in 2016. The National Gallery deal quietly expired in January this year after the company undertook a review of its corporate partnerships, documents released under freedom of information rules reveal. Shell staff emailed the gallery to confirm it was not renewing its corporate membership, believed to cost in the region of \u00a320,000-\u00a335,000 a year. They said the decision was to allow the company to \u201cfocus on our work to inspire the next generation of engineers through our Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) education programmes\u201d. Unions representing workers at the museum welcomed the end of the relationship with Shell. Clara Paillard, the president of the culture group at the PCS union, said: \u201cAs the recent IPCC report has confirmed the urgency of tackling climate change within the next 12 years, fossil fuel companies have got no place in our public museums and should become persona non grata like tobacco companies.\u201d However, activists said the oil and gas giant was simply shifting its funding to science institutions and events such as the company\u2019s annual Make the Future event, which is attended by schoolchildren. Chris Garrard, a co-director of Culture Unstained, said: \u201cBy ending its partnership with the National Gallery and shifting into science education, Shell is admitting that it was never a genuine philanthropist but a toxic company with an image to clean up.\u201d The Guardian understands that Shell has been deliberately refocusing its spending away from the arts to science institutions and school programmes that it sees as aligning more closely with its business. The company believes directing more funding towards Stem projects, for example, could go some way to addressing the gender pay gap in the energy sector. BP, by comparison, is still a sponsor of the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Opera House. Next in campaigners\u2019 sights is Shell\u2019s sponsorship of an exhibition that opened on Thursday at the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester. The oil company\u2019s sponsorship of the Electricity: The spark of life exhibition has already led several partners in the Manchester Science festival to withdraw in protest. The Science Museum Group, which runs the Manchester museum as well as one in London and several around the country, has come under pressure from scientists to sever its ties with oil and gas companies because of their contribution to climate change. The Science and Industry Museum has defended the Shell partnership, saying it is able to operate because of \u201ca range of individual philanthropists, corporate partners and charitable trusts\u201d in a time when \u201cgovernment funding is declining in real terms\u201d. Shell said its sponsorship of the exhibition was \u201cpart of the longstanding relationship between Shell and the science museum, based on shared interests such as the need to inspire young people about science\u201d. A spokesperson added: \u201cThe institutions we work with changes over time and while we are not currently working with the National Gallery, we are always open to doing so again in the future.\u201d A National Gallery spokesperson said: \u201cLike many museums the gallery develops partnerships with businesses from a variety of sectors. Shell supported the National Gallery from 2006 until 2018, both as a sponsor and a corporate member.\u201d",

ending its partnership with the National Gallery and shifting into science education, Shell is admitting that it was never a genuine philanthropist but a toxic company with an image to clean up.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian understands that Shell has been deliberately refocusing its spending away from the arts to science institutions and school programmes that it sees as aligning more closely with its business.</p> <p>The company believes directing more funding towards Stem projects, for example, could go some way to addressing the gender pay gap in the energy sector.</p> <p>BP, by

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond\u2019s plan to bring down the government\u2019s annual borrowing was back on track last month after a blowout in August that knocked the chancellor off course. Public sector net borrowing in September, excluding the nationalised banks, was \u00a34.1bn \u2013 \u00a3800m less than in the same month last year. The drop had the effect of cutting the level of borrowing since April to \u00a319.9bn, which is \u00a310.7bn less than in the first six months of the 2017 financial year. Hammond aims to reduce annual public borrowing to zero by the mid 2020s, but faces a stern test in the budget, when he must explain how he intends to meet this target while meeting fresh spending commitments on the NHS, lifting the cap on local authority borrowing and freezing fuel duty. Pressure from Tory MPs to ease austerity is also expected to force the chancellor to include a raft of proposals to boost Whitehall budgets, eating further into a war chest that exceeds \u00a317bn. According to the Office for National Statistics, September\u2019s figures showed that a small drop in corporation tax receipts and a decline in stamp duty on the sale of homes was offset by a rise in income tax payments and VAT receipts, driven by the World Cup and summer high street spending. Heavy restrictions on Whitehall spending, on both day-to-day running costs and investment, and a drop in interest payments on government debt, also played a part in helping Hammond reverse August\u2019s shock rise in borrowing, when it grew by \u00a32.4bn compared with the same month a year ago to \u00a36.8bn. The deficit in September was the smallest since 2007, and leaves borrowing in the year to date down by 35% on last year, said Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Capital Economics. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, has predicted a full-year borrowing requirement down by just 7% compared with last year. It now looks likely the chancellor will better that by a considerable margin, giving him a large war chest to spend in the budget at the end of this month. Wishart said he expected that given the better-than-expected data in the first five months of the fiscal year, the OBR will likely revise down its borrowing this year from \u00a337bn to \u00a333bn in its budget forecast. \u201cHowever, if the fall in borrowing in the latest data for September, which comes too late to be incorporated into the OBR\u2019s budget projections, were sustained, borrowing would come in well below \u00a330bn this year,\u201d he said. The UK\u2019s total government borrowing stood at \u00a31.8tn at the end of September, which equates to 84.3% of GDP. A spokeswoman for the Treasury said: \u201cThis is the lowest half-year borrowing for 16 years \u2013 showing the strong progress we have made in fixing our public finances. But, at over 85% of GDP last year, our debt remains too high.\u201d \u201cOur balanced approach is getting debt falling while supporting our vital public services, keeping taxes low and investing in Britain\u2019s future,\u201d she added. Wishart said: \u201cLooking further ahead, the OBR\u2019s pessimistic GDP growth projections, combined with pre-announced commitments to increase NHS funding and freeze fuel duty, suggest that the government will not be on track to deliver its aim of eliminating the deficit entirely by the mid-2020s.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jurors who ruled that Monsanto caused a dying man\u2019s cancer are fighting to uphold their landmark $289m verdict, publicly urging a judge not to overturn their decision in a groundbreaking trial. Four California jurors told the Guardian that they were shocked and angry to learn that the judge overseeing their trial had moved to throw out their unanimous verdict, which said the agrochemical corporation failed to warn consumers that its popular weedkiller product posed health risks. The ruling in August, which sparked concerns across the globe about the Roundup herbicide, included $250m in punitive damages to the plaintiff, Dewayne \u201cLee\u201d Johnson, who has terminal cancer. But San Francisco superior court judge Suzanne Bolanos stunned campaigners and jurors last week when she issued a tentative ruling on Monsanto\u2019s appeal motion, saying she would likely grant a new trial due to the \u201cinsufficiency of the evidence\u201d. \u201cI was just gobsmacked and outraged. I was astonished,\u201d Robert Howard, juror No 4, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cWhy do we have a jury system if the judge can just toss it out?\u201d Bolanos hasn\u2019t yet made a final ruling, leading to an unusual public plea from the jurors and mounting pressure on the judge in recent days. Some jurors said they became emotionally invested in the trial and now felt it was their duty to advocate for their decision and fight for Johnson to receive his award. It\u2019s a high-stakes moment in a years-long battle surrounding glyphosate, the world\u2019s most widely used herbicide, which studies have shown is linked to cancer. Monsanto, now owned by Bayer, the German pharmaceutical company, has long sold the chemical under the brands Roundup and Ranger Pro, and has continued to argue that it is safe to use and does not cause cancer. Johnson, who could have months to live, has become a hero to some cancer patients and families, and thousands have filed similar legal claims across the US. Gary Kitahata, another juror, said he was swayed by the evidence presented by Johnson\u2019s attorneys, especially internal Monsanto emails suggesting the company had worked to stifle critical research while promoting and contributing to studies that concluded glyphosate was safe. \u201cThey were protecting a product that was very important to the corporation\u2019s bottom line,\u201d said Kitahata, a 64-year-old consultant for local governments, who served as juror No 1. Monsanto\u2019s private communications about science made it easy for the jury to rule that the company \u201cacted with malice or oppression\u201d, which led to the punitive damages award, Kitahata said. \u201cThat should be the corporation\u2019s job, to make sure their product is safe \u2026 If there are any questions, that should be on the product warning label.\u201d Johnson, a father of three who lives in northern California, testified that he would not have sprayed the herbicide on school grounds if the label had warned of cancer risks. Even though the trial has ended and the jury was dismissed, more than half its members showed up to court last week for an appeal hearing out of personal interest, some taking the time off work, the jurors said. The hearing was about the appeal by Monsanto, which has argued that the evidence presented did not support the jury\u2019s decision and was at odds with science. Charlie Kaupp, juror No 11, said he was \u201cincredibly disappointed\u201d and \u201cvery surprised\u201d to learn that the judge seemed to be siding with Monsanto and invalidating the jury\u2019s collective work. \u201cNow that the verdict is threatened, we felt almost a continuation of our civic duty to protect our own verdict. We have pride in it. We worked hard. We felt we did the right thing.\u201d Some jurors have written formal letters to the judge urging her to reconsider, and activists are now pressuring Bolanos with an online petition. Bolanos, who is expected to make a final decision in the coming days, could rule to lower the monetary award or could toss out the verdict altogether and grant a new trial. The judge has also raised questions about the way the jury calculated the $33m it awarded in future non-economic damages. Kitahata said he was perplexed at why the judge didn\u2019t raise these questions during the trial: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating.\u201d Kaupp, a 39-year-old product manager at a software company, said the jury had \u201cfollowed the judge\u2019s instructions to a tee\u201d, adding that the six-week trial was a \u201cbig emotional investment on the part of all the jurors, but more importantly, we still believe we issued the correct verdict\u201d. Howard, 60, wrote a letter to Bolanos saying the jury\u2019s \u201cintegrity, intelligence, and common sense has been cleverly and openly attacked by inference\u201d, adding: \u201cThe possibility that, after our studious attention to the presentation of evidence, our adherence to your instructions, and several days of careful deliberations, our unanimous verdict could be summarily overturned demeans our system of justice and shakes my confidence in that System.\u201d He told the Guardian that the trial had motivated him to divest from corporations like Monsanto, adding: \u201cIt was a life-changing experience for me.\u201d Kaupp said he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to put Monsanto out of business\u201d but was concerned about some of its business practices. He added: \u201cI\u2019m probably not going to use Roundup anytime soon.\u201d",

But San Francisco superior court judge Suzanne Bolanos stunned campaigners and jurors last week when she issued a tentative ruling on Monsanto\u2019s appeal motion, saying she would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/10/monsanto-cancer-trial-weedkiller-challenge-dewayne-johnson\">likely grant a new trial</a> due to the \u201cinsufficiency of the evidence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was just gobsmacked and outraged. I was astonished,\u201d Robert Howard, juror No 4, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cWhy do we have a jury system if the judge can just toss it out?\u201d</p> <p>Bolanos hasn\u2019t yet made a final ruling, leading to an unusual public plea from the jurors and mounting pressure on the judge in recent days. Some jurors said they became emotionally invested in the trial and now felt it was their duty to advocate for their decision and fight for Johnson to receive his award.</p> <p>It\u2019s a high-stakes moment in a years-long battle surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/30/fda-weedkiller-glyphosate-in-food-internal-emails\">glyphosate</a>, the world\u2019s most widely used herbicide, which studies have shown is linked to cancer. Monsanto, now owned by Bayer, the German pharmaceutical company, has long sold the chemical under the brands Roundup and Ranger Pro, and has continued to argue that it is safe to use and does not cause cancer. Johnson, who could have months to live, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/07/monsanto-trial-cancer-appeal-glyphosate-chemical\">become a hero to some cancer patients and families</a>, and thousands have filed similar legal claims across the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/25/monsanto-dewayne-johnson-cancer-verdict\">The man who beat Monsanto: 'They have to pay for not being honest'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gary Kitahata, another juror, said he was swayed by the evidence presented by Johnson\u2019s attorneys, especially internal Monsanto emails suggesting the company had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/09/monsanto-trial-roundup-weedkiller-cancer-dewayne-johnson\">worked to stifle critical research</a> while promoting and contributing to studies that concluded glyphosate was safe.</p> <p>\u201cThey were protecting a product that was very important to the corporation\u2019s bottom line,\u201d said Kitahata, a 64-year-old consultant for local governments, who served as juror No 1.</p> <p>Monsanto\u2019s private communications about science made it easy for the jury to rule that the company \u201cacted with malice or oppression\u201d, which led to the punitive damages award, Kitahata said. \u201cThat should be the corporation\u2019s job, to make sure their product is safe \u2026 If there are any questions, that should be on the product warning label.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson, a father of three who lives in northern California, testified that he would not have sprayed the herbicide on school grounds if the label had warned of cancer risks.</p> <p>Even though the trial has ended and the jury was dismissed, more than half its members showed up to court last week for an appeal hearing out of personal interest, some taking the time off work, the jurors said. The hearing was about the appeal by Monsanto, which has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-monsanto-cancer-lawsuit-analysis/monsanto-roundup-appeal-has-uphill-climb-on-junk-science-grounds-legal-experts-idUSKBN1KZ2EW\">argued</a> that the evidence presented did not support the jury\u2019s decision and was at <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-glyphosate-lawsuits/bayers-monsanto-asks-us-court-to-toss-289-million-glyphosate-verdict-idUSKCN1LZ0H7\">odds</a> with science.</p> <p>Charlie Kaupp, juror No 11, said he was \u201cincredibly disappointed\u201d and \u201cvery surprised\u201d to learn that the judge seemed to be siding with Monsanto and invalidating the jury\u2019s collective work.</p> <p>\u201cNow that the verdict is threatened, we felt almost a continuation of our civic duty to protect our own verdict. We have pride in it. We worked hard. We felt we did the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>Some jurors have written formal letters to the judge urging her to reconsider, and activists are now pressuring Bolanos with an <a href=\"https://advocacy.organicconsumers.org/page/7458/petition/1\">online petition</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/10/monsanto-trial-cancer-dewayne-johnson-ruling\">Monsanto ordered to pay $289m as jury rules weedkiller caused man's cancer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bolanos, who is expected to make a final decision in the coming days, could rule to lower the monetary award or could toss out the verdict altogether and grant a new trial. The judge has also raised questions about the way the jury calculated the $33m it awarded in future non-economic damages.</p> <p>Kitahata said he was perplexed at why the judge didn\u2019t raise these questions during the trial: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating.\u201d</p> <p>Kaupp, a 39-year-old product manager at a software company, said the jury had \u201cfollowed the judge\u2019s instructions to a tee\u201d, adding that the six-week trial was a \u201cbig emotional investment on the part of all the jurors, but more importantly, we still believe we issued the correct verdict\u201d.</p> <p>Howard, 60, wrote a letter to Bolanos saying the jury\u2019s \u201cintegrity, intelligence, and common sense has been cleverly and openly attacked by inference\u201d, adding: \u201cThe possibility that, after our studious attention to the presentation of evidence, our adherence to your instructions, and several days of careful deliberations, our unanimous verdict could be summarily overturned demeans our system of justice and shakes my confidence in that System.\u201d</p> <p>He told the Guardian that the trial had motivated him to divest from corporations like Monsanto, adding: \u201cIt was a life-changing experience for me.\u201d</p> <p>Kaupp said he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to put Monsanto out of business\u201d but was concerned about some of its business practices. He added: \u201cI\u2019m probably not going to use Roundup anytime soon.\u201d</p>",
