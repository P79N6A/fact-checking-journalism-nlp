    "webTitle": "UK looks ill-prepared if a global currency war breaks out", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rumours of war are in the air. Currency war, that is. The US treasury has forged an alliance with Brussels to attack Germany's beggar-thy-neighbour approach to the rest of the eurozone. Last week the Czech government said it would defend its economy by driving down the value of the koruna, following the aggressively interventionist example of Japan and Switzerland. It's not hard to see why the atmosphere is becoming less cordial. This is a low growth world marked by over-capacity. Wages are under downward pressure and this is leading to ever-stronger deflationary pressure. A lack of international policy co-operation means that countries are trying to export deflation somewhere else, using currency manipulation to do so. If a full-scale currency war does break out Britain looks as ill-prepared as it was for a military fight in 1939. We like to think of ourselves as a nation of buccaneering traders but only 16% of small and medium enterprises, with a turnover of over \u00a320m, are actually exporting. We like to think of ourselves as the nation of innovators, yet as Richard Jones, of Sheffield University, notes, the UK is a less research and development intensive country than it was 30 years ago, and it lags well behind most of its rivals. The UK has linked trade and innovation deficits. Jones, in a paper for the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute, examines in detail how during the past 30 years the UK's corporate laboratories have vanished and how big R&amp;D spenders such as ICI and GEC switched from being companies that thought about long-term investment to ones where the prevailing doctrine was to return the money spent on R&amp;D to shareholders. Those in charge of UK manufacturing companies became more interested in the next bid, the next deal and the next set of quarterly results than in developing new product ranges. The consequences of decades of neglect of the country's productive base and an over-reliance on North Sea oil and financial services are now glaringly apparent. In the past, recessions have ended with the current account broadly in balance. This recovery starts with a current account deficit of more than 3% of national output. This is despite a fall of 20% in the value of the pound between 2007 and 2013, which in theory should have boosted exports. In reality, exports grew by 0.4% a year between early 2009 and the start of 2013, compared with 1% a year in the previous decade. Ministers have a pat answer when quizzed about the poor performance of exports. It is, they say, the result of geography. More than 40% of UK exports go to the eurozone, where growth is weak and demand for imports has collapsed. So the impact of sterling's depreciation has been blunted. This view is not shared by the Bank of England. While admitting that the global recovery is patchy, the bank noted in its February inflation report that \"the relative weakness of UK exports does not reflect particular weakness in its major trading partners\". It concluded that some other explanation was needed \"to explain the disappointing performance of UK exports\", and found it in a sharp drop in exports of financial services and the tendency of UK firms to use a cheaper pound to boost profits rather than increase market share. The decline in exports from the City since the crash highlights the risks for Britain of the \"eggs in one basket\" approach. As Ken Coutts and Bob Rowthorn note in a paper on the prospects for the balance of payments, the UK has gone from being a country that had a 10% of GDP surplus in trade in manufactures in 1950 to running a 4% of GDP deficit by 2011. North Sea oil and gas were in decline, so energy added to the deficit by 1.3% of GDP. Food and government transfers to overseas bodies such as the EU, World Bank and UN were the other big debits. On the other side of the ledger there were three sources of surpluses: financial services and insurance (3.1% of GDP); other knowledge-intensive services, which include law, consultancy and IT (2.5% of GDP); and investment income (1.1% of GDP). Once all the debits and credits were totted up Britain had a current account deficit of 1.9% of national income. This rose to 4% of GDP in 2012. The recession has taken a heavy toll on two of the surplus sectors. Investment income has turned negative, and global demand for financial services has fallen. This has affected the UK more than the other big global providers of financial services, the US and EU. According to the Bank of England, \"This could reflect lower demand for UK financial services in general, or a particularly sharp fall in demand for those financial products in which the UK specialised prior to the crisis.\" This is a polite way of saying that no one any longer wants what Lord Turner once dubbed the City's \"socially useless\" products. Coutts and Rowthorn model what happens to the current account using assumptions for growth in the UK domestic economy and world trade, the level of UK competitiveness, oil prices, North Sea oil and gas production, and returns on financial assets. The baseline projection is that the current account is 3% of GDP in 2022. Using a slightly more pessimistic assumption, the deficit swells to 5% of GDP. As the authors note: \"A deficit of this magnitude would be a cause for serious alarm.\" It certainly would be. The outgoing trade and investment minister, Lord Green, told a conference in the City to mark export week that there was no guarantee the rest of the world would be prepared to finance deficits of this size for ever. The government has a target for raising exports to \u00a31tn a year by 2020 \u2013 which will require them to grow by 9% a year. (The average since 2012 has been 5%.) We have heard the \"export or die\" message many times in the past, to little effect it has to be said. It is not impossible to improve Britain's export performance, though doing so with the current economic model is a pipe dream. It will require nurturing manufacturing, knowledge-based services and those bits of the financial services sector for which there is long-term demand. Britain, Jones says, \"needs to build a new developmental state, a state that once again takes responsibility for large-scale technological innovation as the basis for sustainable growth and prosperity\". Amen to that. If a currency war is brewing, we need the can-do spirit of 1940, not the head-in-the-sands approach of 1938.",

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney hopes to perfect his balancing act if UK recovery continues", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "''Unbalanced growth is better than no growth.\" This was not exactly what the Bank of England's governor Mark Carney said last week when delivering the Bank's quarterly inflation report. It was said by one of his illustrious predecessors, Eddie George, in a previous era. But that was Carney's hidden message, combined with a public expression of hope that growth in the British economy would indeed become more balanced. The Bank is now confident enough to declare that a recovery is at last under way, but, for all the loud headlines about the timing of rises in interest rates, the true position of Bank officials is that they really do not know how sustainable this recovery will turn out to be. The \"forward guidance\" initiated by Carney is that, provided inflation remains under control, there will be no need even to consider raising interest rates until unemployment, now calculated at 7.6% of the labour force, falls to 7%. Even then, the new governor goes out of his way to suggest that, for him, this would not necessarily mark a turning point. He could hardly have been clearer at his press conference, although to listen to some commentators, you would think differently. He went out of his way to emphasise that there is \"a substantial degree of slack\" in the economy. What the Bank is really doing is seeing how it goes. During the recovery phase after most postwar recessions, a growth rate of 3% to 4% was not unusual. This has been a recession \u2013 indeed, depression \u2013 to beat all previous postwar episodes, and output is still 2.5% below what it was in 2008, and some 17% below what it might have been by now if the historical trend had continued. The economy appears, from recent data and surveys, to be growing at 2% a year. Unemployment is still far too high, and only time will tell how much spare industrial capacity there is to draw on. Although they don't know exactly how much capacity there is, Carney's use of the word \"substantial\" suggests to me that he may be nearer to the economic consultant Bill Martin's side of the debate \u2013 he calculates that there is plenty \u2013 than to the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is more dubious. This matters because traditionally it is when the economy is operating at full capacity that inflationary tendencies manifest themselves \u2013 and, traditionally, the British economy is very good at manifesting inflationary tendencies. While we are on the subject, I could not resist a wry smile last week when, amid all the concern about energy prices, the Office for National Statistics stated that one of the reasons for the \"better than expected\" monthly inflation figure was \u2013 wait for it \u2013 a fall in energy prices. I am not making this up. But back to that unbalanced recovery. So far the driving force of rising consumer confidence and spending has been assisted by a resumption of borrowing and drawing on savings. The Bank sees the recovery from now on becoming more balanced, with consumers spending out of income, and businesses investing more. Also it thinks the threat to our exports from the battered eurozone is less than it was. I wonder about this. My hunch is that the troubles of the eurozone are far from over, and could yet lead to disaster. This is not a wish, you understand: more of a fear. Now we all know that real incomes have been badly squeezed. I hope I could be as confident as the Bank that they will suddenly become a driving force of recovery. But if they are right, then a recovery of around 2% a year could easily be sustainable. What could wreck things is if the house-price boom that the chancellor is cynically encouraging produces the kind of bubble that Carney and co do not yet detect, and panic increases in interest rates become needed. One of the assumptions that lies behind forward guidance is the belief that micro measures (although they are officially called \"macro-prudential\") can control the property market and delay the need for any rise in rates. So, we have a recovery of sorts, although Labour will rightly want the fruits to be more equally divided than in recent years. Meanwhile I have to take issue with certain writers on the Financial Times \u2013 not, I hasten to emphasise, Sir Samuel Brittan or Martin Wolf \u2013 who have been suggesting that we Keynesian critics, including shadow chancellor Ed Balls, did not want a recovery and have been proved wrong because there is now a recovery. We all wanted a recovery. It is just that, although there were certainly other factors behind the depression, the recovery was seriously delayed by the introduction of austerity programmes all over Europe, and not least in the UK.",

      "body": "<p>For Ireland, it reads like a happy ending. Enda Kenny announced on Thursday that Dublin <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/14/ireland-quits-eu-imf-bailout-kenny\" title=\"\">would make a clean break with its creditors</a> next month, after a gruelling three-year economic fitness programme of tax rises, spending cuts and reforms.</p> <p>Instead of requesting a precautionary credit line from the International Monetary Fund, to be triggered in the event of a future crisis \u2013 as most investors had expected \u2013 Ireland will kick out the hated \"troika\" of the IMF, the ECB and Brussels, and go it alone.</p> <p>With Spain, too, signalling last week that it wouldn't need any more money from its eurozone partners to bail out its crippled banks, and Cyprus pledging to lift restrictions on cross-border capital flows that have been in place since its fumbled bailout last March, it would be tempting to think that the worst of the turmoil that has gripped the eurozone over recent years had come to a neat and tidy close, and that \"normalcy\", as Irish finance minister Michael Noonan calls it, had been restored.</p> <p>Yet while Noonan was right to say that the eurozone currently looks quite tranquil \u2013 making it a good moment for Ireland to dip its toe back into the public debt markets, instead of relying on the troika to fund its deficits \u2013 last week brought a host of reminders that there may still be trouble ahead.</p> <p>For one thing, the economic weather across the 17-member single currency bloc is deteriorating. While the 18-month eurozone recession came to an end in the second quarter of 2013, <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-14112013-AP/EN/2-14112013-AP-EN.PDF\" title=\"\">the latest data, published last week</a>, showed GDP expanding by a paltry 0.1% in the third quarter, with the French economy recording a contraction.</p> <p>Alongside that sluggish growth performance, there is an increasingly credible threat that the eurozone could slip into deflation: indeed, some of the hardest-hit peripheral economies are already there.</p> <p>Across the eurozone as a whole, prices rose by a negligible 0.7% in the year to October. In Greece, they fell by almost 2%.</p> <p>It was undoubtedly the fear of deflation that prompted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/02/eurozone-interest-rates-ecb\" title=\"\">Mario Draghi to cut European Central Bank interest rates</a> to a record low earlier this month: it is most central bankers' worst&#xa0;nightmare.</p> <p>If falling prices become entrenched, it can be extremely difficult to escape from a vicious cycle of declining profits, wages and growth \u2013 and unlike US Federal Reserve chairman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ben-bernanke\" title=\"\">Ben Bernanke</a>, Draghi won't just be able to turn on the money taps and implement quantitative easing, as it's not clear the ECB even has the authority to do so \u2013 QE is certainly taboo in Germany, still haunted by memories of Weimar-era hyperinflation.</p> <p>For debtors, of which there are many across the eurozone \u2013 households, companies and governments \u2013 deflation is particularly pernicious, as liabilities tend to be fixed, unlike the incomes from which they must somehow be paid. And when debtors get into trouble, so do banks \u2013 still the weakest link in the eurozone recovery story.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the ECB is preparing to shine a light on banks' balance sheets through its asset quality review \u2013 and with negotiations about a eurozone-wide banking union still ongoing, no one quite knows what will happen if they find a black hole. Oh, and with the Federal Reserve contemplating withdrawing the $85bn-a-month of cheap money it has been pumping into world markets through QE, government bond yields worldwide \u2013 and thus their borrowing costs \u2013 are expected to drift higher over the next 12 months.</p> <p>And just in case all that wasn't enough to fret about, Friday saw Brussels deliver its sinisterly named \"fiscal surveillance package\", part of the new co-ordination regime put in place in the wake of the crisis, which doled out homework to a whole list of countries. Spain and Italy were urged to revise their budgets or risk missing stringent debt targets; France was told to get its act together on structural reforms; and even Germany, which likes to see itself as a shining example to its eurozone neighbours, was criticised for ignoring the commission's calls for reform.</p> <p>In other words, even if Dublin's politicians have made the right judgment and Ireland is fit enough to stand on its own, it could yet be sucked back into the mire by a eurozone-wide crisis not of its own making.</p> <h2>From On the Buses to on your bike</h2> <p>Forty-five years have passed since Reg Varney \u2013 aka Stan Butler in <em>On the Buses</em> \u2013 became the first person to withdraw cash from a hole-in-the-wall machine. It heralded a revolution in banking. No longer was cash accessible only from a teller sporting a rubber thimble between 9am and 3pm on weekdays and for a couple of hours on a Saturday morning. It was available 24/7. There have been other revolutions since \u2013 debit cards, telephone banking, call centres, which have all resulted in fewer high street banks and tellers. And now another is under way.</p> <p>The proliferation and popularity of online banking means that an average customer now visits a branch just twice a month, while mobile banking services are used more than once every two days. A survey out on Friday showed that one in six of 18-to-30-year-olds had never stepped inside a bank branch.</p> <p>So it is not exactly a shock that last week Barclays said it wanted 1,700&#xa0;of its 33,600 branch staff to put their hands up for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/14/barclays-warned-mistake-cut-1700-branch-jobs\" title=\"\">voluntary redundancy</a>. That is just over one job going from every branch in the Barclays network. People are being replaced by iPads and smartphones: customers can sort out their bills and standing orders from their sofas. And even those who still venture inside branches are being encouraged to think digital, with iPads available for use there too. The labour and other costs of offering a retail banking service are, basically, being transferred to the customer.</p> <p>There are other huge changes under way: customers can transfer cash directly to their friends in bars and restaurants with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/feb/16/barclays-pingit-money-sending-smartphone\" title=\"\">Pingit</a> app. The UK's three largest mobile phone networks, EE, Vodafone and O2, have joined forces to turn smartphones into virtual wallets. Shoppers will walk into a store, pick out a purchase, scan the barcode, and pay by tapping their phone on an Oyster-card-style reader, rather than at the till. There are even safety deposit boxes in the cloud.</p> <p>Antony Jenkins, the Barclays boss, has been talking about automation ever since he took the top job a little over a year ago. Analysts believe he could slice 40,000 off the 140,000 workforce. It will be brutal. And it will be universal.

      "bodyText": "For Ireland, it reads like a happy ending. Enda Kenny announced on Thursday that Dublin would make a clean break with its creditors next month, after a gruelling three-year economic fitness programme of tax rises, spending cuts and reforms. Instead of requesting a precautionary credit line from the International Monetary Fund, to be triggered in the event of a future crisis \u2013 as most investors had expected \u2013 Ireland will kick out the hated \"troika\" of the IMF, the ECB and Brussels, and go it alone. With Spain, too, signalling last week that it wouldn't need any more money from its eurozone partners to bail out its crippled banks, and Cyprus pledging to lift restrictions on cross-border capital flows that have been in place since its fumbled bailout last March, it would be tempting to think that the worst of the turmoil that has gripped the eurozone over recent years had come to a neat and tidy close, and that \"normalcy\", as Irish finance minister Michael Noonan calls it, had been restored. Yet while Noonan was right to say that the eurozone currently looks quite tranquil \u2013 making it a good moment for Ireland to dip its toe back into the public debt markets, instead of relying on the troika to fund its deficits \u2013 last week brought a host of reminders that there may still be trouble ahead. For one thing, the economic weather across the 17-member single currency bloc is deteriorating. While the 18-month eurozone recession came to an end in the second quarter of 2013, the latest data, published last week, showed GDP expanding by a paltry 0.1% in the third quarter, with the French economy recording a contraction. Alongside that sluggish growth performance, there is an increasingly credible threat that the eurozone could slip into deflation: indeed, some of the hardest-hit peripheral economies are already there. Across the eurozone as a whole, prices rose by a negligible 0.7% in the year to October. In Greece, they fell by almost 2%. It was undoubtedly the fear of deflation that prompted Mario Draghi to cut European Central Bank interest rates to a record low earlier this month: it is most central bankers' worst nightmare. If falling prices become entrenched, it can be extremely difficult to escape from a vicious cycle of declining profits, wages and growth \u2013 and unlike US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, Draghi won't just be able to turn on the money taps and implement quantitative easing, as it's not clear the ECB even has the authority to do so \u2013 QE is certainly taboo in Germany, still haunted by memories of Weimar-era hyperinflation. For debtors, of which there are many across the eurozone \u2013 households, companies and governments \u2013 deflation is particularly pernicious, as liabilities tend to be fixed, unlike the incomes from which they must somehow be paid. And when debtors get into trouble, so do banks \u2013 still the weakest link in the eurozone recovery story. Meanwhile, the ECB is preparing to shine a light on banks' balance sheets through its asset quality review \u2013 and with negotiations about a eurozone-wide banking union still ongoing, no one quite knows what will happen if they find a black hole. Oh, and with the Federal Reserve contemplating withdrawing the $85bn-a-month of cheap money it has been pumping into world markets through QE, government bond yields worldwide \u2013 and thus their borrowing costs \u2013 are expected to drift higher over the next 12 months. And just in case all that wasn't enough to fret about, Friday saw Brussels deliver its sinisterly named \"fiscal surveillance package\", part of the new co-ordination regime put in place in the wake of the crisis, which doled out homework to a whole list of countries. Spain and Italy were urged to revise their budgets or risk missing stringent debt targets; France was told to get its act together on structural reforms; and even Germany, which likes to see itself as a shining example to its eurozone neighbours, was criticised for ignoring the commission's calls for reform. In other words, even if Dublin's politicians have made the right judgment and Ireland is fit enough to stand on its own, it could yet be sucked back into the mire by a eurozone-wide crisis not of its own making. From On the Buses to on your bike Forty-five years have passed since Reg Varney \u2013 aka Stan Butler in On the Buses \u2013 became the first person to withdraw cash from a hole-in-the-wall machine. It heralded a revolution in banking. No longer was cash accessible only from a teller sporting a rubber thimble between 9am and 3pm on weekdays and for a couple of hours on a Saturday morning. It was available 24/7. There have been other revolutions since \u2013 debit cards, telephone banking, call centres, which have all resulted in fewer high street banks and tellers. And now another is under way. The proliferation and popularity of online banking means that an average customer now visits a branch just twice a month, while mobile banking services are used more than once every two days. A survey out on Friday showed that one in six of 18-to-30-year-olds had never stepped inside a bank branch. So it is not exactly a shock that last week Barclays said it wanted 1,700 of its 33,600 branch staff to put their hands up for voluntary redundancy. That is just over one job going from every branch in the Barclays network. People are being replaced by iPads and smartphones: customers can sort out their bills and standing orders from their sofas. And even those who still venture inside branches are being encouraged to think digital, with iPads available for use there too. The labour and other costs of offering a retail banking service are, basically, being transferred to the customer. There are other huge changes under way: customers can transfer cash directly to their friends in bars and restaurants with the Pingit app. The UK's three largest mobile phone networks, EE, Vodafone and O2, have joined forces to turn smartphones into virtual wallets. Shoppers will walk into a store, pick out a purchase, scan the barcode, and pay by tapping their phone on an Oyster-card-style reader, rather than at the till. There are even safety deposit boxes in the cloud. Antony Jenkins, the Barclays boss, has been talking about automation ever since he took the top job a little over a year ago. Analysts believe he could slice 40,000 off the 140,000 workforce. It will be brutal. And it will be universal. Tellers could soon be history. PPI scourge could do with a bank job There was a bit of moaning when Natalie Ceeney was named chief financial ombudsman four years ago.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The flotation of Royal Mail will come under renewed scrutiny this week when MPs question some of the City's top investment bankers about the valuation placed on the company. At Wednesday's session of the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, MPs will quiz top advisers from Goldman Sachs and UBS, the investment banks that ran Royal Mail's flotation last month. They will also hear from representatives of JP Morgan, Citi and Deutsche Bank \u2013 three City firms that missed out on running the share sale \u2013 and Panmure Gordon, a broker that was scathing about what it said was the undervaluation of Royal Mail. The price for the flotation was set at 330p a share \u2013 at the top of the original range and valuing Royal Mail at \u00a33.3bn. But the shares jumped 38% on the first day of trading and closed on Friday at 560p, giving the company a market value of \u00a35.57bn. Adrian Bailey, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: \"I think the committee collectively realises that the difference between the float price and the current price is an area that requires questions and is potentially embarrassing to the government. \"What we are trying to find out is exactly how the government arrived at the valuation it did and, given that the valuation was way out from the current trading price, what lessons can be learned for any future privatisations.\" Panmure Gordon argued before the shares started trading that the business was really worth up to \u00a34.5bn. Gert Zonneveld, Panmure's joint head of research, said he was certain the government had got the price wrong and had sold Royal Mail on the cheap. At the end of the first day of trading, the company was valued at \u00a34.55bn \u2013 a shade over the upper end of Zonneveld's pre-float estimate. Armed with more information after the initial public offering, Zonneveld said there was potential for further price rises and slapped a 529p price target on Royal Mail, which would value the company at \u00a35.3bn. At his last appearance before the BIS committee, two days before the flotation, Vince Cable, the business secretary, described the Panmure valuation as an \"outlier\" and dismissed the likely jump in the share price as \"froth\". But it then emerged that in its failed pitch to run the prized IPO, JP Morgan had told the government that Royal Mail could be worth \u00a310bn including its \u00a3800m debt. JP Morgan's representative, John Mayne, is likely to be asked whether this revelation was \"sour grapes\", as Bailey put it. The bank declined to comment ahead of the session. Katy Clark, a Labour member of the committee, said: \"We want to hear what officials were told. What was the basis on which the advice was provided \u2013 and if the asset was worth a huge amount more, was that information given to the secretary of state and why wasn't it proceeded on?\" The grilling has wider implications for the advising banks and the government. There are rumblings that Goldman and UBS should go without some of their fees if it is found they got the valuation wrong. So far the underwriters have received \u00a312.7m but a further \u00a34.2m will be paid at the government's discretion. Bailey said: \"Questions need to be asked about the criteria used to qualify for the deferred payment.\" Members of the committee will also want to know how sell-offs of state assets can be improved, including that of taxpayers' 81% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Next week, Cable and his ministerial colleague Michael Fallon will appear in front of the committee. He will be joined by a banker from Lazard, the institution that vetted the flotation price. The pricing of the flotation will be the main subject of discussion on Wednesday but MPs will also quiz Goldman and UBS on how the shares were distributed, amid reports of disgruntlement among UK pension funds over a perceived bias towards sovereign wealth funds. In a letter to the committee after the flotation, Cable said the government considered increasing the offer price beyond the stated 330p. He said that Goldman, UBS and Lazard advised against this because long-term investors opposed to the move would have withdrawn support and it was hard to judge what the result would be for the IPO. Friends of Fallon said that, having committed the government to selling shares directly to the public, the government needed the shares to rise once trading began to avoid upsetting thousands of potential voters. Top fund managers would also have been furious if the shares had fallen. Pricing a company for flotation is as much an art as it is a science \u2013 an observation that might well form an element of the bankers' defence on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "Britain has emerged from financial crisis and recession with its obsession for property wholly intact, so it seems only appropriate that one of the fastest-growing tech businesses in the country is bringing that mania into the internet age. Launched five years ago, Zoopla has already become the country's No 2 property website, second only to Rightmove. It is the go-to site for nosy homeowners to check out how much their neighbours paid for their houses \u2013 or to watch their own property's value rise. But its founder, Alex Chesterman, has bigger ambitions. \"No 2 is not good enough,\" he has said. The serial entrepreneur had the same attitude when building up his previous enterprise, online DVD rental service ScreenSelect, which he built over three years and merged with LoveFilm in 2006. \"I am very competitive,\" he says. \"I will leave no stone unturned to be No 1. We got into the space to win, not to be the No 2 player.\" The insight that would become Zoopla came from Chesterman's own experience of househunting, when he set up an Excel spreadsheet using Land Registry data to calculate the prices of comparable properties. When he later began initial research for Zoopla, just one in three adults knew that historical market transaction data \u2013 the foundation of the site's large and growing dataset \u2013 was freely available. The result is a site \u2013 developed with co-founder Simon Kain, a software specialist who worked alongside Chesterman at ScreenSelect and Amazon \u2013 that is not only for househunters but also has the data to satisfy that endless curiosity among homeowners about the value of their and their neighbours' properties. \"What we do is combine property search with property research,\" he said. \"We list historic sales prices, the current value of every home in the country\u2026 the internet made vast amounts of data readily and freely available, but it was all over the place. \"What we wanted to do was set up a one-stop shop where people can go and find out everything that is interesting and important in making the key decision about where they want to live.\" It could be a winning formula with investors. The company recently hired Swiss bank Credit Suisse to explore growth opportunities, including the possibility of an initial public offering. At a possible valuation of \u00a31.3bn, Chesterman's 9% stake would be worth more than \u00a3100m. But Zoopla had an inauspicious start \u2013 just a few months after the website launched in January 2008, the property bubble burst. The size of the property-professionals sector shrank by a quarter, with estate agent branches closing nationwide. No stranger to adversity \u2013 his first venture, a late-90s chain of bagel shops with some backing from Marco Pierre White, failed to take off \u2013 Chesterman decided to push on. Five years on, Zoopla has 40 million monthly users and claims to generate 2.5m leads per month for estate agents. Revenues are growing at 20% per year, and it is expected to rake in \u00a365m for 2013 from subscription fees, display advertising and access to consumer data. Just as with ScreenSelect/LoveFilm, Chesterman has bought his way to prominence. In 2009, the company purchased PropertyFinder from News International just weeks after acquiring thinkproperty.com from Guardian Media Group, owner of the Observer. Three years later, it paid an undisclosed sum to A&amp;N Media, part of Daily Mail and General Trust, for Globrix.com. (DMGT, meanwhile, has taken a 50% stake in Zoopla.) And just this September, Zoopla bought Trinity Mirror's property arm for \u00a33.3m, rounding out a portfolio of former newspaper property businesses. In all, over the last four years, Zoopla has bought out 10 businesses, outpacing even ScreenSelect, which took over seven companies in its first three years. Those acquisitions have put Zoopla neck-and-neck with Rightmove, a much older company founded in the first dotcom boom. Other than pointing out that, by measures such as number of property listings and measures of brand awareness the two are level, the competitive Chesterman doesn't much like talking about his rival. \"We are much more focused on our own business than our competitors', and we will continue investing in our brands and products until we achieve our mission of providing the most useful online resources for property consumers in the UK,\" he says. Some of the sites Zoopla buys are absorbed, others retain their identity. \"We normally just redirect [to the Zoopla site],\" says Chesterman, \"but some speciality sites we keep.\" To that end, SmartNewHomes and HomesOverseas, two of its acquisitions from Trinity Mirror, will continue operating; but the days are numbered for another Trinity acquisition, Zoomf.com. Zoopla's competitors have now become its customers. \"We power the property search on all the ISPs, all the national newspapers, and the regional newspapers,\" says Chesterman proudly. In the immediate future, expansion will focus on seizing an ever-increasing share of the market for property adverts. Despite the success of Zoopla and Rightmove, digital still doesn't even account for half of property ad spending. Next year, it's expected to finally break that barrier as sellers chases the estimated 90% of buyers who visit a website before calling an estate agent. And what about the temptation of that possible \u00a31.3bn valuation? \"In terms of what's on the horizon for us,\" Chesterman says, \"we're not immediately looking to do anything\u2026 We really are focused on building out the business.\"",

When he later began initial research for Zoopla, just one in three adults knew that historical market transaction data \u2013 the foundation of the site's large and growing dataset \u2013 was freely available.</p> <p>The result is a site \u2013 developed with co-founder Simon Kain, a software specialist who worked alongside Chesterman at ScreenSelect and Amazon \u2013 that is not only for househunters but also has the data to satisfy that endless curiosity among homeowners about the value of their and their neighbours' properties.</p> <p>\"What we do is combine property search with property research,\" he said. \"We list historic sales prices, the current value of every home in the country\u2026 the internet made vast amounts of data readily and freely available, but it was all over the place.</p> <p>\"What we wanted to do was set up a one-stop shop where people can go and find out everything that is interesting and important in making the key decision about where they want to live.\"</p> <p>It could be a winning formula with investors. The company recently hired Swiss bank Credit Suisse to explore growth opportunities, including the possibility of an initial public offering. At a possible valuation of \u00a31.3bn, Chesterman's 9% stake would be worth more than \u00a3100m.</p> <p>But Zoopla had an inauspicious start \u2013 just a few months after the website launched in January 2008, the property bubble burst. The size of the property-professionals sector shrank by a quarter, with estate agent branches closing nationwide. No stranger to adversity \u2013 his first venture, a late-90s chain of bagel shops with some backing from Marco Pierre White, failed to take off \u2013 Chesterman decided to push on.</p> <p>Five years on, Zoopla has 40 million monthly users and claims to generate 2.5m leads per month for estate agents. Revenues are growing at 20% per year, and it is expected to rake in \u00a365m for 2013 from subscription fees, display advertising and access to consumer data.</p> <p>Just as with ScreenSelect/LoveFilm, Chesterman has bought his way to prominence. In 2009, the company purchased PropertyFinder from News International just weeks after acquiring thinkproperty.com from Guardian Media Group, owner of the <em>Observer</em>. Three years later, it paid an undisclosed sum to A&amp;N Media, part of Daily Mail and General Trust, for Globrix.com. (DMGT, meanwhile, has taken a 50% stake in Zoopla.) And just this September, Zoopla bought Trinity Mirror's property arm for \u00a33.3m, rounding out a portfolio of former newspaper property businesses.</p> <p>In all, over the last four years, Zoopla has bought out 10 businesses, outpacing even ScreenSelect, which took over seven companies in its first three years.</p> <p>Those acquisitions have put Zoopla neck-and-neck with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/rightmove\" title=\"\">Rightmove</a>, a much older company founded in the first dotcom boom. Other than pointing out that, by measures such as number of property listings and measures of brand awareness the two are level, the competitive Chesterman doesn't much like talking about his rival.</p> <p>\"We are much more focused on our own business than our competitors', and we will continue investing in our brands and products until we achieve our mission of providing the most useful online resources for property consumers in the UK,\" he says.</p> <p>Some of the sites Zoopla buys are absorbed, others retain their identity. \"We normally just redirect [to the Zoopla site],\" says Chesterman, \"but some speciality sites we keep.\" To that end, SmartNewHomes and HomesOverseas, two of its acquisitions from Trinity Mirror, will continue operating; but the days are numbered for another Trinity acquisition, Zoomf.com.</p> <p>Zoopla's competitors have now become its customers. \"We power the property search on all the ISPs, all the national newspapers, and the regional newspapers,\" says Chesterman proudly.</p> <p>In the immediate future, expansion will focus on seizing an ever-increasing share of the market for property adverts. Despite the success of Zoopla and Rightmove, digital still doesn't even account for half of property ad spending. Next year, it's expected to finally break that barrier as sellers chases the estimated 90% of buyers who visit a website before calling an estate agent.</p> <p>And what about the temptation of that possible \u00a31.3bn valuation? \"In terms of what's on the horizon for us,\" Chesterman says, \"we're not immediately looking to do anything\u2026 We really are focused on building out the business.\"</p>",
