Threadneedle Street is continuing with its own stress tests, and the European Central Bank (ECB), which takes over the regulation of banks in the eurozone on 4 November, has also reviewed the quality of the assets held by banks. This so-called asset quality review of 130 eurozone banks found that assets of \u20ac48bn had been overvalued by the lenders, and the ECB also found that there were another \u20ac136bn of bad loans sitting in banks. An additional bank \u2013 Liberbank of Spain \u2013 failed the ECB tests while passing the EBA exam. Among the countries whose banks failed the EBA tests were Italy, with nine failures, Greece and Cyprus, with three each, and Ireland and Germany.

      "bodyText": "The dramatic effect of falling oil prices on profits in the energy sector will be underlined this week as BP unveils third quarter earnings that could be as much as 20% lower than the same period last year. The cost of crude on global markets has plunged since June, reflecting faltering growth in the world economy, reduced fears about Middle East production levels and soaring US shale output. Shares in BP, yet to recover to levels seen before the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, have fallen by 13% this year on the back of the lower oil price, while Exxon Mobil and Chevron stock is down by 7%. BP\u2019s quarterly financial figures will also be damaged by lower oil and gas output from maturing fields, along with the effect of its disposal programme, which has seen many assets sold off to help pay the bill for the Gulf of Mexico disaster. Fadel Gheit, an analyst with New York brokerage Oppenheimer, said he had pencilled in a 16% fall in BP profits, slightly less than the 20% average expected by other Wall Street analysts. \u201cBP results are not going to be something to write home about. It is not a great surprise because I estimate the average selling price of its oil over that quarter is down from $110 per barrel to $102,\u201d he said. More disturbing for the company, in Gheit\u2019s eyes, is last month\u2019s finding of gross negligence by a court in New Orleans over the Gulf well blowout that \u201cno-one expected\u201d. This could open BP up to a further $18bn worth of fines on top of the $40bn already spent on penalties or compensation if a new appeal by the company is not successful.

      "body": "<p>When General Mills announced plans to buy Annie\u2019s, the maker of rabbit-shaped mac and cheese, howls of protest were felt quicker than a toddler without his favorite carbs. How could Annie\u2019s, a company known for its opposition to genetically modified foods, sell to a giant food conglomerate that <a href=\"http://www.generalmills.com/en/ChannelG/Issues/on_biotechnology.aspx\">says GMO foods are not just harmless, but smart</a>?<br></p> <p>True, \u201cThe General\u201d agreed to let Annie\u2019s maintain its non-GMO stance. And the selling price of $820m didn\u2019t hurt. </p> <p> But Annie\u2019s is the just latest example of a beloved startup that chooses to sell itself to a big company. You can say it began when Ben and Jerry\u2019s was bought by Unilever. Like General Mills, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-31/gmo-labeling-ben-and-jerrys-parent-company-unilever-at-odds\">Unilever is on record as opposing letting consumers know when it\u2019s using GMO foods</a>. Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, in contrast, is on the opposite side: it in the process of transforming its flavors to non-genetically modified ingredients and created a new flavor, Food Fight, to raise money to <a href=\"http://www.benjerry.com/GMO\">support a Vermont law on GMO labelling</a>. <br></p> <p>Cult brands get sold. But what happens in the process is instructive for every small business owner and entrepreneur who has considered giving up control to ensure his or her company grows. <br></p> <p>Iams pet food was bought by Procter and Gamble. Tom\u2019s toothpaste is now part of Colgate-Palmolive. Honest Tea became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company. Most recently, Tom\u2019s, the company that donates a pair of shoes to a needy child for every pair it sells, agreed to sell half of itself to private-equity firm Bain Capital (of Mitt Romney fame) to fund an expansion of its operations in the US and overseas. And both parents are wise enough to leave the kids alone. </p> <p>Some entrepreneurs believe a company is forever. Others see it this way: selling your company one day is the whole point. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c4b1737aadf3a0ff72e571439b06ae582487770\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414182348432/d730f8e1-4689-4cb1-93ce-73b9f3c3e757-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"GMO\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s supports labelling GMO foods, as these activists urged in a national protest last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nyc Labret/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Making friends early<br></h2> <p> \u201cWhen you start a company, you\u2019re building it for success and for acquisition partners to come to you,\u201d says Nadeem Kassam, who sold his start-up Basis Science to tech giant Intel. <br></p> <p>Kassam, a former entertainment industry executive, started his company in 2004, but didn\u2019t come to Silicon Valley until 2010. As he was raising money from venture capitalists for Basis, he realized he would have to prove his credibility. His co-founder was a techie, so that went some way to allaying the fears of the VCs. <br></p> <p>\u201cI had a record of success in the entertainment industry but not in Silicon Valley, so it was an uphill battle to sell myself and the product,\u201d Kassam says. </p> <p>He persevered in that early experience not just to get the funding, because he wanted the company to attract the attention of influential potential buyers early. \u201cIdeally, by building a company that captures market share, you will turn the eyes and ears of some of the big boys,\u201d Kassam says. <br></p> <p> \u201cThe investors you have in your company are critical for your future success,\u201d Kassam says. <br></p> <p>The plan worked. \u201cIntel came to the company in the B round and that is when firms like Google, Samsung and Apple began to take notice. And that is when Intel began to consider taking us in-house.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fadcc6b816fc728b7faf23b6a493296806938c2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/23/1414094056211/c9107c14-012d-4343-8454-7b5b0752d972-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"intel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Selling to a big company can be a fraught decision for a small business owner or entrepreneur like Nadeem Kassam</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pichi Chuang/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The course of mergers and acquisitions never did run smooth, however. Food brands, unlike tech ones, establish close relationships with consumers, and a merger can feel like a betrayal to loyalists. <br></p> <p> Honest Tea, a beloved maker of iced tea drinks, felt the wrath of customers when the company sold itself to Coca-Cola. In 2008, Goldman and Nalebuff sold 40% of the company to Coca-Cola for $43m. In 2011, they sold the remainder of the company to Coca-Cola for an undisclosed amount. The Organic Consumers Association called for a boycott of Honest Tea and all Coca-Cola products, \u201cbecause Honest Tea\u2019s parent company, Coca-Cola, spent $3.2m to defeat GMO labeling initiatives in California and Washington state.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople put our product in their bodies. So the consumer does connect on an emotional level to food brands. Any time an entrepreneurial brand becomes part of a large company, you will have points where they two parties are not going to see eye to eye,\u201d says Seth Goldman, the \u201cTeaEO\u201d of Honest Tea. </p> <p>\u201cI have a response I give to people that explains our position on issues and more often than not, the customer who thinks for himself or herself will listen to your side,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cThey might still boycott your product but at least they listened.\u201d</p> <p>Authenticity and bootstrapping is a creation story that\u2019s important to many customers. Honest Tea had that. Goldman co-founded in 1998 with Barry Nalebuff, his professor at the Yale School of Management. Goldman quit his job at Calvert Investments, and started brewing batches of tea in his kitchen. Neither he nor Nalebuff had experience in running a business, but raised $500,000 from their families. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6064c3c740ce72b1c4b250ec641a3cd79bb7f43e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/23/1414094312570/216bf6b5-ec69-4a4d-add0-ba62a691608a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Coca-Cola\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">While entrepreneurs can often be delighted to sell their companies to a recognized brand like Coca-Cola, customers may not see it the same way and boycott a beloved company that \u2018sells out\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe put our own money in and both of our parents did as well; and received money from people who would invite back for Thanksgiving; even if we lost their money,\u201d said Goldman.</p> <p> He then brought thermoses of tea and a recycled bottle with a mock-up label to Fresh Fields, which is owned by Whole Foods. Fresh Fields ordered 15,000 bottles. By 2007, Honest Tea had become the best-selling \u201cnatural foods\u201d tea and it was approached by large, multi-national food and beverage companies who were interested in buying the firm or making strategic investments. By then, Honest Tea had become the best-selling tea in the natural foods channel. Grocery chains and other distribution channels were interested in the product and the company needed a distribution solution. <br></p> <p>Goldman felt Coca-Cola, a minority investor for three years, was the way to get there. The investment gave the two companies time to get acquainted. He believes the sales numbers vindicate him. <br></p> <p> \u201cCoke invested in us due to the equity we had in the natural foods market place. In our first 10 years, we sold 112 million bottles. In the subsequent six years since the Coca-Cola investment, we have sold 888 million bottles.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018Companies are bought, not sold\u2019<br></h2> <p> Earlier this year, Chicago entrepreneur Brad Flora sold his latest venture, Perfect Audience, to Marin Software for $23m. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking to sell the company.

      "bodyText": "When General Mills announced plans to buy Annie\u2019s, the maker of rabbit-shaped mac and cheese, howls of protest were felt quicker than a toddler without his favorite carbs. How could Annie\u2019s, a company known for its opposition to genetically modified foods, sell to a giant food conglomerate that says GMO foods are not just harmless, but smart? True, \u201cThe General\u201d agreed to let Annie\u2019s maintain its non-GMO stance. And the selling price of $820m didn\u2019t hurt. But Annie\u2019s is the just latest example of a beloved startup that chooses to sell itself to a big company. You can say it began when Ben and Jerry\u2019s was bought by Unilever. Like General Mills, Unilever is on record as opposing letting consumers know when it\u2019s using GMO foods. Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, in contrast, is on the opposite side: it in the process of transforming its flavors to non-genetically modified ingredients and created a new flavor, Food Fight, to raise money to support a Vermont law on GMO labelling. Cult brands get sold. But what happens in the process is instructive for every small business owner and entrepreneur who has considered giving up control to ensure his or her company grows. Iams pet food was bought by Procter and Gamble. Tom\u2019s toothpaste is now part of Colgate-Palmolive. Honest Tea became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company. Most recently, Tom\u2019s, the company that donates a pair of shoes to a needy child for every pair it sells, agreed to sell half of itself to private-equity firm Bain Capital (of Mitt Romney fame) to fund an expansion of its operations in the US and overseas. And both parents are wise enough to leave the kids alone. Some entrepreneurs believe a company is forever. Others see it this way: selling your company one day is the whole point. Making friends early \u201cWhen you start a company, you\u2019re building it for success and for acquisition partners to come to you,\u201d says Nadeem Kassam, who sold his start-up Basis Science to tech giant Intel. Kassam, a former entertainment industry executive, started his company in 2004, but didn\u2019t come to Silicon Valley until 2010. As he was raising money from venture capitalists for Basis, he realized he would have to prove his credibility. His co-founder was a techie, so that went some way to allaying the fears of the VCs. \u201cI had a record of success in the entertainment industry but not in Silicon Valley, so it was an uphill battle to sell myself and the product,\u201d Kassam says. He persevered in that early experience not just to get the funding, because he wanted the company to attract the attention of influential potential buyers early. \u201cIdeally, by building a company that captures market share, you will turn the eyes and ears of some of the big boys,\u201d Kassam says. \u201cThe investors you have in your company are critical for your future success,\u201d Kassam says. The plan worked. \u201cIntel came to the company in the B round and that is when firms like Google, Samsung and Apple began to take notice. And that is when Intel began to consider taking us in-house.\u201d The course of mergers and acquisitions never did run smooth, however. Food brands, unlike tech ones, establish close relationships with consumers, and a merger can feel like a betrayal to loyalists. Honest Tea, a beloved maker of iced tea drinks, felt the wrath of customers when the company sold itself to Coca-Cola. In 2008, Goldman and Nalebuff sold 40% of the company to Coca-Cola for $43m. In 2011, they sold the remainder of the company to Coca-Cola for an undisclosed amount. The Organic Consumers Association called for a boycott of Honest Tea and all Coca-Cola products, \u201cbecause Honest Tea\u2019s parent company, Coca-Cola, spent $3.2m to defeat GMO labeling initiatives in California and Washington state.\u201d \u201cPeople put our product in their bodies. So the consumer does connect on an emotional level to food brands. Any time an entrepreneurial brand becomes part of a large company, you will have points where they two parties are not going to see eye to eye,\u201d says Seth Goldman, the \u201cTeaEO\u201d of Honest Tea. \u201cI have a response I give to people that explains our position on issues and more often than not, the customer who thinks for himself or herself will listen to your side,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cThey might still boycott your product but at least they listened.\u201d Authenticity and bootstrapping is a creation story that\u2019s important to many customers. Honest Tea had that. Goldman co-founded in 1998 with Barry Nalebuff, his professor at the Yale School of Management. Goldman quit his job at Calvert Investments, and started brewing batches of tea in his kitchen. Neither he nor Nalebuff had experience in running a business, but raised $500,000 from their families. \u201cWe put our own money in and both of our parents did as well; and received money from people who would invite back for Thanksgiving; even if we lost their money,\u201d said Goldman. He then brought thermoses of tea and a recycled bottle with a mock-up label to Fresh Fields, which is owned by Whole Foods. Fresh Fields ordered 15,000 bottles. By 2007, Honest Tea had become the best-selling \u201cnatural foods\u201d tea and it was approached by large, multi-national food and beverage companies who were interested in buying the firm or making strategic investments. By then, Honest Tea had become the best-selling tea in the natural foods channel. Grocery chains and other distribution channels were interested in the product and the company needed a distribution solution. Goldman felt Coca-Cola, a minority investor for three years, was the way to get there. The investment gave the two companies time to get acquainted. He believes the sales numbers vindicate him. \u201cCoke invested in us due to the equity we had in the natural foods market place. In our first 10 years, we sold 112 million bottles. In the subsequent six years since the Coca-Cola investment, we have sold 888 million bottles.\u201d \u2018Companies are bought, not sold\u2019 Earlier this year, Chicago entrepreneur Brad Flora sold his latest venture, Perfect Audience, to Marin Software for $23m. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking to sell the company. Companies are bought, not sold,\u201d he says. Marin approached him about an acquisition in November 2013. Flora said he was open to it \u201cbut not seeking it out expressly.\u201d By February 2014, the company was evaluating several offers. Even with the early approach from Marin, talks were complicated. \u201cMarin made several offers before there was one that made sense given our growth and other options. That process took months of discussions and was very difficult,\u201d Flora says. What settled it: the acquirer promised to be a good steward of the company Flora built. \u201cIn the end, Marin made us an offer we just couldn\u2019t refuse in terms of bringing our product and business to a much wider audience and making an offer that reflected the work we\u2019d done,\u201d he says. Kassam says he chose Intel in part for the same reason: \u201cWe were approached by numerous firms but Intel kept the team and offices intact.\u201d \u201cThe entrepreneur has a dilemma when selling to a larger company,\u201c said Kassam. \u201cIf you see you are reaching a certain stage, it would be responsible to sell.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The energy secretary, Ed Davey, has sought to reassure households that there will be no energy shortage this winter, after a series of fires at power stations raised fears about Britain\u2019s lights going out. Davey said: \u201cThere will be no blackouts. Period.\u201d He made his pledge shortly before THE energy regulator Ofgem publishes its assessment of the UK\u2019s energy supplies on Tuesday. Davey\u2019s assurance, in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, suggests he expects no negative shocks in Ofgem\u2019s energy outlook for autumn and winter, drawn up with National Grid. Fears about an energy crisis during the peak month of January rose last week when a fire halved the output of Didcot B, a power station near Oxford serving the densely populated Thames Valley region. Didcot B is a 1.4 gigawatt power station that supplies about 1m homes. The fire broke out in one of the site\u2019s two cooling towers. The fire at Didcot was the third at a fossil fuel-fired power station this year. After a blaze in February, E.ON decided not to bring one 370MW unit back online at its Ironbridge power station in Shropshire. In July, a fire caused the closure of two units at SSE\u2019s 1GW Ferrybridge coal plant in West Yorkshire. EDF Energy also took two of its nuclear plants out of service in August for inspections after a fault was found. Ofgem said in June, before the run of fires and shutdowns, that the risk of power blackouts within 18 months had doubled from a year earlier. Davey said then he was putting measures in place to counter the threat but admitted: \u201cWithout timely action there would be risks to security of supply.\u201d National Grid said after the Didcot blaze that the longer-term effect on supply was difficult to judge and that the outlook report would take the plant\u2019s reduced capacity into account. Peter Atherton, an energy analyst at Liberum Capital, said the fires, along with boiler problems at EDF\u2019s plants in Heysham and Hartlepool, had removed about 7% of Britain\u2019s conventional and nuclear energy capacity. He said UK energy policy, criticised for lack of investment in infrastructure, had left supply precariously thin. In a note to clients, Atherton said: \u201cThis may just be an unusual run of events, or it might suggest that the aging power station fleet is becoming more vulnerable to accidents. The odds are still that UK will escape a security of supply crunch this winter. But the mere fact that a security of supply crisis is a material possibility is in itself a sign of huge policy failure.\u201d Davey has previously said that the government was prepared to use \u201clast resort\u201d measures to avoid winter blackouts in the next two years. The government has agreed to pay businesses to shut down at peak times. Tuesday\u2019s report will update on efforts to get companies to make mothballed generators available so that there is enough energy for households. The government\u2019s position could be helped by reserves of gas built up during last year\u2019s mild winter. Davey told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cWe have extra contingencies on top of the caution, and extra contingencies on top of the contingencies. \u201cThey [companies] volunteer to get payments \u2013 if the National Grid say \u2018we want you to come off the national grid for a few hours and generate your own power\u2019, you will get paid for that.\u201d Companies could be paid to shift factory production from high periods of demand, to make small reductions in refrigerator temperatures, or to change a shift pattern for a week so that employees start work earlier.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "The windowless plane set for take-off in a decade", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is a glimpse into the future that will inspire wonder in some people but perhaps strike terror into the heart of the nervous flyer: a windowless plane that nonetheless allows passengers to see what\u2019s going on outside, as well as checking their email and surfing the net. In a vision of what the next generation of commercial aircraft could look like in little more than a decade, windows would be replaced by full-length screens allowing constant views of the world outside. Passengers would be able to switch the view on and off according to their preference, identify prominent sights by tapping the screen or even just surf the internet. The early-stage concept for the windowless plane, based on technology used in mobile phones and televisions, hails from the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI), an organisation with sites across north-east England that works with companies to develop new products. It imagines how large, hi-definition, ultra thin and lightweight displays could form the inside of the fuselage, displaying images of the exterior from cameras mounted on the plane\u2019s exterior. But the real ambition echoes a constant quest in the aviation industry: how to reduce weight, which would cut fuel consumption, thereby bringing down fares. According to the CPI, for every 1% reduction in the weight of an aircraft, there is a saving in fuel of 0.75%. The idea came about after discussions about how printable electronics, in which the centre specialises, could be used. \u201cWe had been speaking to people in aerospace and we understood that there was this need to take weight out of aircraft,\u201d said Dr Jon Helliwell of the CPI. By putting windows into a plane, the fuselage needed to be strengthened, he added, and by omitting them in favour of walls of screens on panels, the fuselage would be lighter. \u201cFollow the logical thought through. Let\u2019s take all the windows out \u2013 that\u2019s what they do in cargo aircraft \u2013 what are the passengers going to do? If you think about it, it\u2019s only really the people that are sitting next to windows that will suffer.\u201d These futuristic plans would involve screen panels reflecting whatever view of the outside the passenger wanted, changing in accordance with the direction of their eyes. The screens would be made using organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) \u2013 a combination of materials that give out their own light when activated by electricity. The problems with the technology involve price and their sensitivity to moisture, which means they are generally encased in inflexible glass, mostly in mobile phones and televisions. The key development, said Helliwell, would be flexible OLEDs, which would allow the creation of screens suitable for an aeroplane. Electronics company LG recently posted a video of an 18-inch (46cm) screen which bends and contorts while the images on screen are broadcast uninterrupted. \u201cWhat would be great would be to make devices based on OLEDs that are flexible. We can make transistors that are flexible but if we can make OLEDs that are flexible, that gives us a lot of potential in the market because we can print OLEDs on to packaging, we can create flexible displays,\u201d he said. The CPI is one of seven bodies under the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, an umbrella group which receives government funding to drive growth in manufacturing. Part of the way the CPI operates is to identify challenges in industry \u2013 such as the windowless plane \u2013 and develop ways to overcome them, according to Helliwell. Using \u00a335m worth of advanced equipment in its Sedgefield facility, the CPI says it working on technologies to advance flexible OLEDs and tackle problems of cost and durability. This could lead to the development of the OLEDs and the windowless plane, but could also be used in \u201csmart packaging\u201d for medicines or food which would contain information that could be displayed on a mobile phone. One of the first steps in developing OLEDs is a mask which helps treat eye disease among people with diabetes. The device from PolyPhotonix, which was developed at the CPI, aims to stop the breakdown of blood vessels during sleep as a result of the disease. Using the device, the eye is fooled into thinking that it is daytime, when there is not the same problem with blood vessel breakdown. The concept for the plane, said Helliwell \u2013 letting passengers see outside while allowing a lighter fuselage \u2013 followed discussions with the aerospace industry. The idea of having the displays lining the inside of the plane could become reality in 10 years, after other \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d in the development of OLED are completed, he added. \u201cWe are talking about it now because it matches the kind of development timelines that they have in the aerospace industry. \u201cSo you could have a display next to a seat if you wanted it; you could have a blank area next to a seat if you wanted it; you would have complete flexibility as to where you put [the panel screens]. You could put screens on the back of the seats in the middle and link them to the same cameras.\u201d What are OLEDs OLEDs are a combination of advanced materials that give out their own light when activated by electricity and are typically used to make screens and lighting. Unlike LCD and plasma displays, they do not need a backlight, meaning that they use less energy and can be much thinner than other displays, while also displaying a higher contrast. Among ambitions for OLEDs involve printing them on sheets or wallpapering them on rooms, effectively turning the walls into lights.

      "body": "<p>It is a glimpse into the future that will inspire wonder in some people but perhaps strike terror into the heart of the nervous flyer: a windowless plane that nonetheless allows passengers to see what\u2019s going on outside, as well as checking their email and surfing the net.</p> <p>In a vision of what the next generation of commercial aircraft could look like in little more than a decade, windows would be replaced by full-length screens allowing constant views of the world outside. Passengers would be able to switch the view on and off according to their preference, identify prominent sights by tapping the screen or even just surf the internet.</p> <p>The early-stage concept for the windowless plane, based on technology used in mobile phones and televisions, hails from the <a href=\"http://www.uk-cpi.com/\">Centre for Process Innovation</a> (CPI), an organisation with sites across north-east England that works with companies to develop new products. It imagines how large, hi-definition, ultra thin and lightweight displays could form the inside of the fuselage, displaying images of the exterior from cameras mounted on the plane\u2019s exterior.</p> <p>But the real ambition echoes a constant quest in the aviation industry: how to reduce weight, which would cut fuel consumption, thereby bringing down fares. According to the CPI, for every 1% reduction in the weight of an aircraft, there is a saving in fuel of 0.75%.</p> <p>The idea came about after discussions about how printable electronics, in which the centre specialises, could be used. \u201cWe had been speaking to people in aerospace and we understood that there was this need to take weight out of aircraft,\u201d said Dr Jon Helliwell of the CPI. By putting windows into a plane, the fuselage needed to be strengthened, he added, and by omitting them in favour of walls of screens on panels, the fuselage would be lighter.</p> <p>\u201cFollow the logical thought through. Let\u2019s take all the windows out \u2013 that\u2019s what they do in cargo aircraft \u2013 what are the passengers going to do? If you think about it, it\u2019s only really the people that are sitting next to windows that will suffer.\u201d</p> <p>These futuristic plans would involve screen panels reflecting whatever view of the outside the passenger wanted, changing in accordance with the direction of their eyes.</p> <p>The screens would be made using organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) \u2013 a combination of materials that give out their own light when activated by electricity. The problems with the technology involve price and their sensitivity to moisture, which means they are generally encased in inflexible glass, mostly in mobile phones and televisions. The key development, said Helliwell, would be flexible OLEDs, which would allow the creation of screens suitable for an aeroplane. Electronics company LG recently posted a video of an 18-inch (46cm) screen which bends and contorts while the images on screen are broadcast uninterrupted.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would be great would be to make devices based on OLEDs that are flexible. We can make transistors that are flexible but if we can make OLEDs that are flexible, that gives us a lot of potential in the market because we can print OLEDs on to packaging, we can create flexible displays,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The CPI is one of seven bodies under the <a href=\"https://hvm.catapult.org.uk/\">High Value Manufacturing Catapult</a>, an umbrella group which receives government funding to drive growth in manufacturing. Part of the way the CPI operates is to identify challenges in industry \u2013 such as the windowless plane \u2013 and develop ways to overcome them, according to Helliwell.</p> <p>Using \u00a335m worth of advanced equipment in its Sedgefield facility, the CPI says it working on technologies to advance flexible OLEDs and tackle problems of cost and durability.</p> <p>This could lead to the development of the OLEDs and the windowless plane, but could also be used in \u201csmart packaging\u201d for medicines or food which would contain information that could be displayed on a mobile phone.</p> <p>One of the first steps in developing OLEDs is a mask which helps treat eye disease among people with diabetes. The device from <a href=\"www.polyphotonix.com\">PolyPhotonix</a>, which was developed at the CPI, aims to stop the breakdown of blood vessels during sleep as a result of the disease. Using the device, the eye is fooled into thinking that it is daytime, when there is not the same problem with blood vessel breakdown.</p> <p>The concept for the plane, said Helliwell \u2013 letting passengers see outside while allowing a lighter fuselage \u2013 followed discussions with the aerospace industry. The idea of having the displays lining the inside of the plane could become reality in 10 years, after other \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d in the development of OLED are completed, he added. \u201cWe are talking about it now because it matches the kind of development timelines that they have in the aerospace industry.</p> <p>\u201cSo you could have a display next to a seat if you wanted it; you could have a blank area next to a seat if you wanted it; you would have complete flexibility as to where you put [the panel screens]. You could put screens on the back of the seats in the middle and link them to the same cameras.\u201d</p> <h2>What are OLEDs<br></h2> <p>OLEDs are a combination of advanced materials that give out their own light when activated by electricity and are typically used to make screens and lighting. Unlike LCD and plasma displays, they do not need a backlight, meaning that they use less energy and can be much thinner than other displays, while also displaying a higher contrast. Among ambitions for OLEDs involve printing them on sheets or wallpapering them on rooms, effectively turning the walls into lights.</p> <h2>More from our innovations series</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/19/xeros-bead-washing-machine-system-save-water-energy-home\">The bead washing machine system set to save water and energy</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/12/tooth-decay-dentists-remineralisation-the-innovators\">How remineralisation will take the pain out of tooth decay</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/31/seeing-light-inventor-smart-glasses-vision-blind-people\">Seeing the light: smart glasses boost vision for partially sighted people</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/10/bionic-ear-couple-hochmairs-cochlear-implant-innovators\">The \u2018bionic ear\u2019: the couple who helped the world to hear</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "One of Ireland\u2019s leading banks, with more than one million customers, has failed the European Central Bank\u2019s EU-wide stress test. Permanent TSB\u2019s failure to pass the financial health test has led to assurances from both Ireland\u2019s finance minister and the country\u2019s Central Bank that it will survive. The ECB examination found a \u20ac854.8m (\u00a3673m) hole in Permanent TSB\u2019s reserves. But finance minister Michael Noonan pointed on Sunday to the fact that all of the Republic\u2019s other pillar banks \u2013 Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Merrill Lynch International Bank \u2013 were given a clean bill of health. On Permanent TSB\u2019s prospects, Noonan said: \u201cI am supportive of Permanent TSB\u2019s plans to raise capital from private investors given the taxpayers investment in the bank, the importance of the bank to the economy, its customers (performing and non-performing) and its 2,200 staff. \u201cMy officials will review any proposals made by Permanent TSB and will work with Permanent TSB and other stakeholders to ensure a successful execution of the capital plan in 2015\u201d. Irish and European taxpayers pumped billions of euros into Ireland\u2019s banks following the financial crash of 2008-2009. Many Irish financial institutions were dangerously overstretched after reckless borrowing \u2013 mainly to property speculators and builders during the Celtic Tiger boom years. On the apparent recovery of Irish banks \u2013 the majority of them still in state hands \u2013 the Irish finance minister said: \u201dThe comprehensive assessment was a strict and comprehensive examination of the European banking system and the results for the Irish banks highlight the strength of the banking system and the significant progress that has been made since 2011.\u201d Deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland Cyril Roux echoed the minister\u2019s claim that the results demonstrated progress in the Irish banking sector. On Permanent TSB, Roux stressed that there would be \u201cno adverse impact on the day-to-day operations of any of the banks and no impact on consumers.\u201d The bank has already met the Central Bank and is being given around nine months to raise the capital needed to plug the financial gap in its reserves. It has two weeks to play out its plans to the ECB about how it can recapitalise. The group\u2019s CEO Jeremy Masding said they are looking to bring international investors on board to help the bank to raise the capital required. In a message to its 1.2 million clients across the Republic, Masding added: \u201cCustomers are unaffected by these tests and are not required to do anything as a result of today\u2019s news.\u201d",
