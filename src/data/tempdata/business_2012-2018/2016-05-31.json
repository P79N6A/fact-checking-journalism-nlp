    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A decision to leave the EU would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for British workers who would be \u00a338 a week worse off outside the EU by 2030, according to the TUC. The trade union federation, which is campaigning to persuade voters to remain part of the EU, said Brexit would hit wages, jobs and workers\u2019 rights and warned of a \u201cdevastating\u201d blow to Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector, where highly skilled jobs would be lost. Launching the report at an event in London on Wednesday, the general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, will say: \u201cMy message is simple. At a time of continuing hardship, Brexit would be a disaster for working people \u2013 for our wages, for our jobs and for our rights. \u201c\u00a338 a week may not be much for politicians like [Vote Leave campaigner] Boris Johnson \u2013 a man who described his \u00a3250,000 fee for a weekly newspaper column as \u2018chicken feed\u2019. \u201cBut for millions of workers, it\u2019s the difference between heating or eating, between struggling or saving, and between getting by or getting on.\u201d The TUC, which represents more than 5.8 million workers in 52 unions, said working people would pay the price of weaker trade and economic growth in the event of Brexit, at a time when real wages were still \u00a340 a week below pre-crisis levels. Manufacturing firms would be hit particularly hard, according to the TUC, because so much is exported from British factories to the EU. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has yet to fully recover from the impact of the financial crisis, with output still below its pre-crisis peak. Brexit would result in job losses and a poorer quality of work available in the UK, the TUC will argue, with the regions outside the capital and the south hardest hit. O\u2019Grady will say: \u201cWhat\u2019s absolutely clear is that jobs would go. And not just any old jobs \u2013 we\u2019d be losing high-pay, high-skill, high-productivity jobs. We\u2019d lose manufacturing jobs that pay \u00a3100 a week more than service sector equivalents. These are good jobs in the regions outside of London that need them most. \u201cOur manufacturing sector, still battered and bruised by the recession, would be hit hard. And inequalities between regions would get even wider. That\u2019s why leading firms such as Airbus UK, BMW Mini and Ford have come out so strongly against Brexit.\u201d The TUC said workers\u2019 rights in Britain would also suffer outside the EU, because a vote to leave would give Conservative ministers the green light to repeal certain employment regulations. O\u2019Grady will say: \u201cPregnant women have the right to paid time off for medical appointments. Parents have the right to time off to look after a child who is ill. Part-time and agency workers get equal treatment to give them decency and dignity rather than insecurity. \u201cBrexit would put all of these rights and more at risk. Brexit campaigner Priti Patel let the cat out of the bag when she told the Institute of Directors that leaving the EU would enable us to cut these regulations by half. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m warning people that their rights are on the ballot paper, and a vote to Remain is a vote to keep them.\u201d The CBI said separately there were clear signs that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s membership of the EU was worrying businesses. Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at the business group, said: \u201cWhile underlying conditions for the UK economy are looking pretty stable, the risks are clear as day with uncertainty still brewing over the global outlook and the EU vote around the corner. \u201cExpectations for growth have slipped and are well below the levels of the last few years, with uncertainty swirling around the pace of output and the impact from risks on the horizon.\u201d A CBI survey of 785 businesses across the manufacturing, distribution and service sectors showed that expectations for growth over the next three months weakened in May. A balance of +13% of firms said they expected output to rise in the next three months. The last time it was lower was February 2013. Private sector growth was steady in May, with a balance of +11% of firms reporting that output grew over the past three months, slightly higher than April\u2019s +10% balance.",

      "bodyText": "The idea behind George Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse is a simple one. Improving transport links between the big cities of the north will create economies of scale and greater dynamism. Britain, it is said, can learn lessons from the Rhine-Ruhr region of Germany and the Randstad region of the Netherlands, both of which have a number of cities clustered together. The chancellor has pledged Treasury support for a number of key infrastructure projects, including high-speed rail links. But are the right lessons being learned from Germany and the Netherlands? The Centre for Cities thinktank reckons not. Commuting between Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf in Rhine-Ruhr is no more common than it is between Sheffield and Manchester. Nor, somewhat surprisingly, are the train links much quicker. The real difference is that the individual cities of Rhine-Ruhr and Randstad are powerhouses in their own right. Productivity is higher than the national average in five out of seven Randstad cities and 10 out of 18 in Rhine-Ruhr. This is not the case for any of the 21 cities in the north of England. Average productivity across Rhine-Ruhr and Randstad is 40% higher than in the cities of northern England. The five best performing cities in the north - Leeds, Warrington, Burnley, Liverpool and Manchester - are streets behind their equivalents on the other side of the North Sea - Amsterdam, Bonn, Leverkusen, Haarlemmermeer and D\u00fcsseldorf. So if building high speed rail is not going to provide a magic bullet, what would help to bridge the 50% productivity gap that has opened up between the north of England and the greater south-east? The Centre for Cities says there are three things that would help. Firstly, there should be more devolution of power to the cities and the regions, a process that Osborne has already begun. Secondly, money should be spent on improving transport links within cities rather than between them. Finally, the level of skills needs to be addressed. Only three cities in the north - York, Warrington and Leeds - feature in the UK\u2019s top 20 when it comes to the number of workers educated to degree level. In large part, that\u2019s due to the brain drain of skilled workers from north to south.

      "bodyText": "The forthcoming EU referendum is weighing heavily on the London luxury property market, prompting buyers and sellers to postpone decisions until after the 23 June vote, according to the estate agent Knight Frank. Annual house price growth in May slowed to 0.1% in prime central London, which stretches from Notting Hill to Islington and the City \u2013 the lowest rate since October 2009. Prices in Knightsbridge dropped by 7.5% in the year to May, while values in neighbouring South Kensington and Chelsea were down 4.6% and 3.5% respectively. Several areas were flat, but prices in Islington rose 7.4%. With buyers and sellers of expensive properties postponing decisions until the outcome of the vote is known, the ratio of active buyers per available property has more than halved to 4.8 from 10 over the past year. Tom Bill, Knight Frank\u2019s head of London residential research, said: \u201cThe market has become price sensitive due to higher levels of stamp duty, but an indication of the Brexit effect is that demand in May remained subdued even for properties where asking prices have fallen by 10% or more. Demand was already more restrained as a result of the impact of two stamp duty increases in 18 months.\u201d The number of transactions between January and mid-May was flat compared with 2015. However, there have been signs that underlying demand is strengthening as buyers lower asking prices, the firm said. Viewings increased by 31% between January and April from a year earlier, suggesting a degree of pent-up demand. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 June 2016 after Knight Frank corrected its figures. The figure for Knightsbridge was initially given as a rise of 7.5%, rather than a fall of 7.5%.",

      "bodyText": "Cities in the north of England must become more productive if the chancellor is to realise his vision of a so-called \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, a thinktank has said. The Centre for Cities said George Osborne\u2019s plan to bridge the economic gap between the wealthier south and the poorer north was too heavily focused on intercity transport links, and not enough on improving the performance of individual cities. The HS3 rail link proposal to speed up east-west connections between the major northern cities is a key part of the government\u2019s plan to redress the UK\u2019s economic imbalances. The thinktank, however, said that cities in the Rhine-Ruhr region of Germany and the Randstad region of the Netherlands \u2013 which the government cites as models for the northern powerhouse \u2013 were economically vibrant because individual cities were already strong, not because of better rail links between them. The five most productive cities in the two regions - Amsterdam, Bonn, Leverkusen, Haarlemmermeer and D\u00fcsseldorf - were on average 40% more productive than their UK counterparts of Leeds, Warrington, Burnley, Liverpool and Manchester, the Centre for Cities said. It pointed out that intercity commuter rail links in Rhine-Ruhr and Randstad were actually little better than those in the north of England. Alexandra Jones, the thinktank\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t build a successful northern powerhouse without stronger, more productive cities. \u201cThe government\u2019s initiative has the potential to have a huge impact in addressing the north-south divide, but only if it maintains its original focus of boosting productivity in major northern cities such as Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle. \u201cThese big urban areas have the most potential for growth in the region, but are currently underperforming, especially in comparison to cities in more successful areas such as the Rhine-Ruhr and Randstad areas.\u201d The Centre for Cities suggested three ways policymakers could increase the chances of making the northern powerhouse a success: Address the skills gap in northern cities, where fewer people are educated to degree level than in other areas of the UK. The thinktank said that 47% of people living in Reading had a degree, compared with only a quarter of Liverpool\u2019s residents Improve transport links within northern cities, rather than between them. This would have a bigger impact on improving productivity by enabling people to access jobs across their wider city region Devolve more power to cities and regions, where local skills and transport challenges are better understood Jones said: \u201cInstead of spreading limited monies and political focus equally across the whole region, national and local policymakers should concentrate most resources on addressing the economic challenges that big northern cities and their city regions face, as these have greatest potential to deliver benefits for the north as a whole.\u201d",

It was Philip Green\u2019s interfering and breaking of his word that caused this to happen.\u201d Out of more than \u00a360m of cash left on the balance sheet by Green, the Topshop owner who sold BHS for \u00a31 to Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions just over a year ago, Chappell said he had been forced to pay out more than \u00a320m as upfront guarantees to keep key suppliers on board. He admitted Green had not given a written guarantee that he could secure credit insurance but claimed it had been verbally promised. More than \u00a320m of other funds had gone to pay VAT, wages and rent, according to Chappell, so that the business had been forced to borrow money from property investors the Dellal family at expensive rates to keep BHS trading. The Dellals\u2019 Allied Commercial Exporters (Ace) provided Chappell with \u00a335m in cash needed to demonstrate to Green\u2019s Arcadia group that he was a credible buyer for BHS, then made millions of pounds from a series of property deals and loan agreements with the retailer. Chappell, who is due to appear before a parliamentary inquiry into the demise of BHS next week, said the Dellal family were not linked to the business\u2019s problems. He pointed the finger at Green and blamed BHS\u2019s management team, led by Darren Topp, for taking \u00a340m less than expected over the eight-week Christmas period. \u201cWe were very unlucky and Philip Green knocked us over,\u201d Chappell said. However, Paul Budge, finance director of Green\u2019s Arcadia group, said the company had left more than \u00a390m of cash and debt facilities in BHS for Chappell, as well as providing more than \u00a3100m of guarantees on loans and leaving more than \u00a3100m of property assets in the retailer. \u201cWe could not have given Retail Acquisitions more help or assistance or support to try and make this business work,\u201d Budge said. \u201cThere were probably multiple reasons why it didn\u2019t work but it certainly wasn\u2019t through lack of our help.\u201d BHS had expenses of less than \u00a380m during the month after the deal but would have received receipts of \u00a355m, leaving an outflow of approximately \u00a325m, which could have been financed from cash in the business and property receipts.",

It is not clear if Walden will stay on if Sainsbury\u2019s finalises the \u00a31.4bn takeover deal, but Home Retail Group\u2019s annual report published on Tuesday revealed that in either case the chief executive would be able to cash in more than 650,000 shares and options, which are not subject to performance conditions. Under the terms of Sainsbury\u2019s takeover deal \u2013 which offers 0.321 Sainsbury\u2019s shares and 55p in cash for every Home Retail Group share as well as a 25p windfall from the sale of the Homebase chain and a 2.8p dividend, that would be worth \u00a31m. Walden\u2019s windfall could potentially be more than double that after he was awarded 785,000 shares and share options in May last year, which are subject to three-year performance criteria and worth \u00a31.3m, and 143,000 which he received this year.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 1,000 jobs are to be lost with the closure of 120 Austin Reed outlets after administrators failed to find a buyer for the majority of the 116-year-old tailoring company\u2019s stores. Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day has bought the Austin Reed and Country Casuals brands and just five concessions in Boundary Mills discounter outlets, saving 28 jobs. Administrators AlixPartners said no offers had been received for the rest of the business despite a five-week sales process and the rest of Austin Reed\u2019s stores would close by the end of June. Joint administrator Peter Saville from AlixPartners said: \u201cWe have explored all options to sell the business since our appointment and continued to trade the business with the support of the secured creditors in what is clearly an extremely challenging retail environment. \u201cDespite a significant number of interested parties coming forward during this period it became clear as the process progressed that a viable solution which kept the business whole was not forthcoming. As a result we have made the difficult decision to cease trading the business and commence a wind-down of the estate.\u201d Austin Reed Group has 100 standalone stores and 50 concessions throughout the UK and Ireland and employed 1,184 staff when it went into administration in April. It is understood that AlixPartners have secured the sale of the lease on the group\u2019s flagship Regent Street store to its landlord Hermes Real Estate Investment Management. The administrator has hired property consultant GCW to help sell off the rest of the portfolio, which is expected to be broken up and sold to a wide range of retail groups in small tranches. Some stores are likely to go to other bidders for the business who dropped out of the sale process, including Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley. The brand, whose customers included Winston Churchill and Elizabeth Taylor in its glory days, has struggled in recent years and in 2015, used a company voluntary agreement to close 31 unprofitable stores. It also moved out of its vast London flagship store at 113 Regent street in 2011, exchanging it for smaller premises over the road. Neil Saunders, of retail analysts Conlumino, said that the perception of Austin Reed\u2019s quality had dropped as it cut the cost of suit manufacture while keeping prices steady. \u201cCustomers noticed and defected \u2013 some to more premium brands like Gieves &amp; Hawkes, some younger customers to more innovative, contemporary brands like Suit Supply.\u201d Richard Hyman, an independent retail consultant, agreed: \u201cAustin Reed has faced growing competition from Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s menswear, which has looked much better in the last 18 months, Moss Bros, which has been turned around, and the likes of TM Lewin, Ted Baker and Reiss. The competition has become much more fierce and Austin Reed hasn\u2019t really moved itself on or been able to update its image or its product offering.\u201d He said the company had partly been hindered by a lack of investment. Alteri Investors, which invests in troubled retail companies, recently took control of Austin Reed, whose customers include the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. Alteri bought the retailer\u2019s debt and equity from Darius Capital, a group controlled by the property tycoon Guy Naggar, who was previously involved in the collapsed investment company Dawnay Day. Dawnay Day, which once owned the Chez G\u00e9rard restaurant chain, bought Austin Reed, then listed on the London Stock Exchange for \u00a349m, in 2006. The collapse of Austin Reed comes as administrators try to secure a future for BHS. A number of bidders, including Day and Ashley, have also pulled out of buying that business raising fears that it may also collapse if a deal cannot be secured. The last remaining bidder for the whole BHS group is understood to be a Portuguese-backed consortium led by Greg Tufnell, the former managing director of Mothercare and Burton.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The French investigators who raided Google\u2019s Paris offices last week have revealed the extreme security measures taken to keep their investigation hidden from the technology group, with teams working offline and never referring to the company by name. Codenamed operation Tulip, the investigation was named after the shell company in the Netherlands through which Google routes billions in revenues each year to avoid taxes on most of its overseas income. France\u2019s chief state financial prosecutor, Eliane Houlette, said her team had worked under the strictest secrecy since receiving an official complaint regarding Google from the finance ministry in June 2015. The measures, which included using computers only for word processing and avoiding all internet connections, ensured there were no leaks during the year-long investigation. Houlette said during a video interview: \u201cWe treated the complaint in total confidentiality, taking into account the activity of this company. \u201cIn order to ensure this total confidentiality ... we decided not to ever use the name Google, but to use another name, Tulip, and we managed this operation entirely off-grid, offline. With a computer, but a computer that was text-only, that was disconnected.\u201d Speaking to French media group Europe 1, she described her department\u2019s efforts as a David v Goliath battle. French prosecutors suspect Google of aggravated financial fraud and organised money laundering. In a dawn raid last week, officials descended on the firm\u2019s Paris head office in a day-long search, which Houlette revealed resulted in a haul of information at least as large as the Panama Papers. Google said of the allegations: \u201cWe comply with French law and are cooperating fully with the authorities to answer their questions.\u201d The allegations of fraud are a major escalation of a long-running, Europe-wide campaign to secure a larger slice of Google\u2019s revenues. Its parent Alphabet has reportedly received a bill for \u20ac1.6bn in unpaid taxes from the French government. Last Tuesday, 96 people marched in through the gates of the H\u00f4tel Vatry, the vast mansion built for a French count where the majority of Google\u2019s 700 French staff are based. The raid involved six magistrates, 25 IT experts and officers from the central office for the fight against corruption and financial and tax crimes (OCLCIFF). In the UK, the chancellor, George Osborne, has come under fire from Labour and the Scottish National party for accepting a top-up payment of \u00a3130m including interest from Alphabet, which brought the company\u2019s total tax bill for 2005-2015 to around \u00a3200m. During this time, the company reported UK revenue of \u00a324bn. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, described the settlement as \u201cderisory\u201d. He wrote to Osborne last week saying HM Revenue and Customs must \u201curgently\u201d liaise with the French authorities to see if they have evidence that could reopen the British tax case against Google. Houlette said that with \u201cseveral terabytes\u201d of information to process, the investigation would stretch into months but she hoped it would not last years. She said that Google hardly paid any taxes in France because its French company \u201cserves as a screen\u201d, securing contracts with advertisers but booking the revenue from those contracts via Ireland. Google says that for tax purposes, it does not have what is known as a permanent establishment in France. This allowed the company to book an estimated \u20ac1.7bn from French advertisers in 2014, but report revenues in country of just \u20ac216m. As a result, its tax bill was just \u20ac5m. The same arguments have slashed Google\u2019s tax bills in the UK, Italy and other major European markets. From Ireland, its revenues are sent to Google Netherlands Holdings BV. Using an accounting technique known as the \u201cdouble Irish, Dutch Sandwich\u201d, the Dutch company then sends its cash to a Bermuda-based but Irish-registered affiliate called Google Ireland Holdings. In 2014, \u20ac10.7bn was moved through the Netherlands subsidiary to Bermuda, which does not charge offshore companies income tax. Houlette\u2019s department is pursuing 358 cases, including a major tax inquiry into McDonald\u2019s. She said: \u201cWe lead investigations of great magnitude, of great geographical magnitude and of great technological magnitude.\u201d The prosecutor told the French senate that other governments were not always helpful, saying France has not received the cooperation it needs from the governments of Russia, Qatar, Mauritius or Switzerland.",

The raid involved six magistrates, 25 IT experts and officers from the central office for the fight against corruption and financial and tax crimes (OCLCIFF).</p> <p>In the UK, the chancellor, George Osborne, has come under fire from Labour and the Scottish National party for accepting a top-up payment of \u00a3130m including interest from Alphabet, which brought the company\u2019s total tax bill for 2005-2015 to around \u00a3200m. During this time, the company reported UK revenue of \u00a324bn.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, described the settlement as \u201cderisory\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/25/google-paris-raid-john-mcdonnell-hmrc-george-osborne-revisit-tax-settlement\">He wrote to Osborne last week saying HM Revenue and Customs must \u201curgently\u201d liaise with the French authorities</a> to see if they have evidence that could reopen the British tax case against Google.</p> <p>Houlette said that with \u201cseveral terabytes\u201d of information to process, the investigation would stretch into months but she hoped it would not last years.</p> <p>She said that Google hardly paid any taxes in France because its French company \u201cserves as a screen\u201d, securing contracts with advertisers but booking the revenue from those contracts via Ireland. </p> <p>Google says that for tax purposes, it does not have what is known as a permanent establishment in France. This allowed the company to book an estimated \u20ac1.7bn from French advertisers in 2014, but report revenues in country of just \u20ac216m. As a result, its tax bill was just \u20ac5m.</p> <p>The same arguments have slashed Google\u2019s tax bills in the UK, Italy and other major European markets.

      "bodyText": "The closing scores on European markets showed: The FTSE 100 fell 40 points or 0.64% to 6230.79 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.68% to 10,262.74 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.53% lower at 4505.62 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.45% to 18,025.25 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.91% at 9034.0 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.93% to 646.97 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 88 points or 0.5%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Inmarsat looks set to leave the FTSE 100 in the quarterly reshuffle announced on Wednesday. The changes are based on Tuesday\u2019s closing prices, and its near 4% fall making it the day\u2019s biggest faller in the index has confirmed the inevitable. The changes need to be ratified on Wednesday, but it\u2019s pretty safe to say Inmarsat will be replaced by Hikma Pharmaceuticals, as forecast. Companies set to be demoted from the FTSE 250 are: Jimmy Choo, Highbridge Multi-Strategy Fund, Interserve, Lookers, Melrose Industries, Northgate and Ophir Energy. They are likely to be replaced by: Ascential, CMC Markets, Countryside Properties, CYBG, Hill &amp; Smith, Metro Bank and Smurfit Kappa Group. European markets have ended the last day of the month on a downbeat note, with declines accelerating through the day after a Guardian/ICM poll showing the Brexit camp firmly in the lead ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. The poll knocked sterling lower which in turn unsettled equity investors. Mixed signals from the US economy also took the shine off shares. Markets had seemingly been taking the prospect of a US rate rise, perhaps as early as June, in their stride, supported by the idea that at least the US economy was showing signs of strength. But ahead of the non-farm payrolls figures due on Friday, weaker consumer confidence and manufacturing figures put a bit of a dent in that theory. There was also some caution ahead of some key events this week. As well as non-farms there is the latest meeting of the European Central Bank and a get-together of Opec ministers. So the FTSE 100, which had been heading for a fourth successive monthly rise, actually ended May slightly in the red. But European shares fared better, with the Stoxx 600 index rising 1.7% on the month, its best performance since October. With metal prices hit by the stronger dollar, copper declined more than 7% in May, the biggest monthly fall since November. Gold has lost nearly 6%, again its worst peformance since November. Oil has recorded its fourth monthly rise in a row, helped by output disruptions from Nigeria, Libya and Canada. With markets slipping lower, Joshua Mahony at IG said: What looked like a boring day in the markets has been kicked into gear as the European indices fell sharply after a surprise EU referendum poll in favour of the \u2018leave\u2019 campaign. Most notably, with the FTSE attempting to break out of its 30 point range that has dominated the past week, this could set the groundwork for a very volatile week. Today has seen a substantial amount of data released, and with a whole week of economic data risk ahead, traders will be wary of increased unpredictability in the coming days. Then there is the US data: At a time when markets have been seemingly focusing on the positives of a stronger economy rather than the looming possibility of a rate hike, today\u2019s data highlights the fact that while a hike is likely, consumers may not feel so optimistic. Today\u2019s rise in the Fed preferred core PCE measure of inflation paves the way for a potential hike in the summer, yet with consumer confidence on the wane, it is clear the everyday person is not looking forward to the prospect of higher rates. Two Guardian/ICM polls showing voters moving in favour of the UK leaving the European Union have helped send sterling to a one week low against the dollar and euro. The pound fell nearly a cent to $1.4547 after news of the polls, while the euro rose 0.8% to 76.72p. As a consequence, stock markets are slipping back on concerns about the disruption which might be caused by a Brexit vote. The FTSE 100 is down 0.4% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.3% lower. See the latest EU referendum developments in our live blog here: And another May miss. The Dallas Fed Texas manufactuing index has come in at -20.8, down from -13.9 in April and well below expectations of a figure of -8. And more on the Chicago PMI numbers: On the confidence figures, Lynn Franco at the Conference Board said: Consumer confidence declined slightly in May, primarily due to consumers rating current conditions less favorably than in April. Expectations declined further, as consumers remain cautious about the outlook for business and labor market conditions. Thus, they continue to expect little change in economic activity in the months ahead. So after a couple of pieces of US data which beat expectations, we have two in a row which have disappointed. The US consumer confidence index came in at 92.6 in May compared to forecasts of 96. This is down on the April figure of 94.7 (itself revised up from 94.2). This is the lowest level for the Chicago PMI since February and the sixth time it has been in contraction over the past 12 months. Index compilers MNI said: \u201cBarring a solid revival in June, the second quarter could be the weakest outturn since the fourth quarter of 2015 given the April-May average of just 49.9.\u201d MNI chief economist Philip Uglow said: While expectations are that growth in the US economy will bounce back in the second quarter, the evidence from the MNI Chicago Report shows activity weakening from an already low level. Firms ran down stocks at the fastest pace for more than 6 years in May, and while a rebuilding over the coming months could support output, the underlying message appears to be that businesses are not confident about the outlook for growth. After the earlier strong US economic data, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index has come in weaker than expected in May. The index fell from 50.4 in April to 49.3, below estimates of a level of 50.7. Anything below 50 signals contraction. More for the Federal Reserve to think about. Back in the US, and markets have opened virtually unchanged after the day\u2019s economic data came in stronger than expected and renewed talk of a possible rate rise next month. On Friday Fed chair Janet Yellen said an increase would be appropriate in the coming months. Investors remain cautious however ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers, the last before the Fed\u2019s June meeting. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 8 points or 0.04%, torn between the prospect of a rate rise and the data showing the economy is growing more strongly than expected. Here\u2019s our story confirming that 1,000 jobs are to go as 120 Austin Reed stores are shut: More fuel for the members of the Fed who want to raise rates before long: better than expected housing figures. US single family house prices rose 5.4% in March on a year on year basis, the same as the previous month and higher than forecasts of a 5.2% increase, according to the latest S&amp;P/Case Schiller index. David M. Blitzer at the Index Committee said: The economy is supporting the price increases with improving labor markets, falling unemployment rates and extremely low mortgage rates. Another factor behind rising home prices is the limited supply of homes on the market. Just in..... personal spending across America rose by a chunky 1.0% in April. That beats estimates of a 0.7% rise, and is the biggest jump since August 2009. It suggests US consumers were pretty upbeat about economic prospects last month. Reuters explains: The Commerce Department said on Tuesday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged 1.0 percent last month as households bought automobiles and a range of other goods and services. The Commerce Department also reports that personal incomes in America rose by 0.4% in April. That\u2019s in line with expectations, and means that spending is outstripping income growth. It may fuel the debate about whether the Federal Reserve could, or should, raise interest rates.... Good news! Portugal is growing twice as fast as we thought. Bad news! Portugal only grew by 0.2% in the last quarter. That\u2019s according to the Lisbon stats office, which has revised up the initial growth estimates (from 0.1% to 0.2%) today (the FT has more details). It means the Portuguese economy has now grown for the last two years, but not fast enough to eliminate fears about the country, which was bailed out in 2011. Today\u2019s jobless report also showed that Portugal has the fourth-higher unemployment rate in the EU, at 12%. Investors should enough the quiet of May while they can, because June is going to be very dramatic. Britain\u2019s vote on EU membership will obviously be huge, while America\u2019s central bank\u2019s monetary policy meeting could also move global markets. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, says: \u2018\u2019As the month of May comes to an end, June looks likely to be even more volatile \u2013 with a potential US interest rate hike, the EU referendum in the UK and the price of oil being key risk factors for a market that has been on edge for the entire year. May was a month where expectations of interest rate increases in the US were brought forward, with the Fed\u2019s Bullard the latest prominent voice to suggest that a hike is approaching fast. This week, the markets will be looking to the May non-farm payrolls data on Friday \u2013 a strong jobs number will be seen as providing the Fed with the data needed to push ahead with an interest rate hike in June.\u2019\u2019 Swiss bank UBS is also predicting plenty of action: A reminder that it\u2019s a big week for US economic data, especially for those wondering if the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. It starts with US personal income figures for April, in an hour\u2019s time, followed by the consumer confidence report at 3pm BST. Developments in Athens.... The drop in European unemployment hasn\u2019t improved the mood in a rather damp City. All the main stock markets are now in the red, as May drags to an end. The news that the eurozone is still experiencing negative inflation may be weighing on spirits, as Conner Campbell of Spreadex explains: The Eurozone-wide inflation figure, meanwhile, came in at an expected -0.1%. That is an improvement on the -0.2% seen last month, but still means that the region has spent more of 2016 in deflation territory than it has not despite the influx of new stimulus measures back in March. None of this news provided much cheer for investors. Over in Greece, scuffles have broken out between protesting port workers and riot police. The dock workers are demonstrating in the Greek capital, against plans to privatise Piraeus, the largest port in Greece. They fear the sale, which is demanded by creditors, will cost jobs. The workers have already been on strike for six days, in the latest show of opposition against Greece\u2019s austerity programmes. The Kathimerini newspaper has more details: Fearing layoffs, port workers have been on 48-hour rolling strikes since last week and have said they will not return to work unless their requests are addressed. \u201cEverything, taxes, bills, the living cost, is going up. Daily food has become more expensive. And myself, I don\u2019t know if I have job tomorrow,\u201d said port worker Antonis Peristerakis, 49, father of two children. \u201cI need security. I want to have food for my children. I don\u2019t want to look for a job at the age of 49.\u201d Back in the UK, almost 1,000 jobs are being lost as part of a deal to \u2018rescue\u2019 high street tailor Austin Reed. That\u2019s according to the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Ben Marlow, who writes: The majority of Austin Reed\u2019s stores will close with the loss of nearly 1,000 jobs after administrators to the collapsed menswear chain were only able to find a buyer for its famous brand and stock. Sources familiar with the negotiations said Edinburgh Woollen Mill had refused to take the bulk of the shops as part of a deal, meaning administrators will now begin an orderly \u2018wind down\u2019 of the chain\u2019s estate in the coming days. The move comes a month after Austin Reed went into administration, handing control of the company to AlixPartners. AlixPartners had hoped to find a buyer for some, or all, of the business. Dragons\u2019 Den star Touker Suleyman, and Sports Direct chief Mike Ashley, had both emerged as possible options. Young people are still bearing the brunt of Europe\u2019s unemployment problem. The youth jobless rate in the EU has dropped to 18.8%, from 20.7% in April 2015. That still leaves 4.2 million under-25s out of work across the region. In the euro area, the youth unemployment rate is now 21.1%. And again, the situation is much worse in some countries than others. The lowest rates were observed in Germany (7.0%), Malta (8.9%) and the Czech Republic (9.5%), and the highest in Greece (51.4% in February 2016), Spain (45.0%), Croatia (38.9% in the first quarter 2016) and Italy (36.9%). Martin Janicko, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, also believes Europe\u2019s labour market is improving... \u201cThe euro zone\u2019s unemployment rate was 10.2% in April, unchanged from the previous month but down from 11% a year earlier.\u201d \u201cDeclines in the jobless rate were recorded in most euro zone countries. Particularly encouraging are drops in joblessness in Greece, Ireland, and Spain. Periphery countries have had the largest drops over the past few months, reflecting their rebound, while the European core broadly held ground. Nevertheless, headline unemployment and youth unemployment rates are still elevated in the euro zone, with only Germany reporting a youth unemployment rate below 10%.\u201d \u201cThe downward trend in the jobless rate will likely persist in coming months, reflecting improving economic conditions around the monetary bloc, labour market reforms, and a strengthening industrial base in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Businesses and consumers should benefit from easier access to credit following the easing of lending standards and a monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction to the news that the eurozone inflation rate remains negative this month, at -0.1%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says inflation remains \u201cwithin the doldrums\u201d; even though the European Central Bank is running a huge bond-buying QE programme and record low interest rates. Despite the ECB embarking on a substantial round of easing, the fact that the Eurozone remains within deflation is a clear heads up that monetary policy alone cannot fix the problem of stagnant price growth. Holger Zschaepitz, journalist at Die Welt, points out that the ECB has massively expanded its balance sheet recently, in an attempt to drive up inflation. But Fred Ducrozet of private Swiss bank Pictet points out that core inflation (stripping out energy and food costs) has risen: Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, reckons today\u2019s data shows the eurozone labour market is slowly improving. He points out that the jobless total did drop in April, although not by enough to pull the headline rate down from 10.2%. Eurozone unemployment fell by 63,000 in April to stand at 16.420 million, which is the lowest level since August 2011..... The decent underlying marked drop in Eurozone unemployment in April/March suggests that the pick-up in Eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter may be feeding through to lift employment. There are still stark differences in Europe\u2019s labour markets, which partly reflects the austerity measures imposed on its weaker members. Today\u2019s report shows that there are 21.2 million unemployed men and women across the 28 countries which make up the EU, including 16.4 million were in the euro area. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (4.1%), Germany (4.2%) and Malta (4.3%). But there\u2019s no prizes for guessing the country with the highest unemployment rates --its Greece (24.2% in February 2016), followed by Spain (20.1%). Unemployment in the European Union has hit a new seven-year low of 8.7% in April. That\u2019s rather better than the eurozone average of 11.2%, but still means Europe is lagging behind America (where the jobless rate is 5%) The eurozone is still stuck in negative inflation! Prices across the single currency region fell by 0.1% in May, the flash estimate from Eurostat shows. Once again, cheap oil is mainly responsible. Energy prices fell by 8.1% year-on-year in May, while service prices rose by 1%. Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco gained 0.8%, while non- energy industrial goods cost 0.5% more. Here comes the splurge of Euorpean economic data, to take City traders\u2019 minds off the weather. And Europe\u2019s unemployment rate remains stuck at 10.2% in April, meaning no improvement on March\u2019s figures.... Told you it was looking a bit grim out there #splishsplashsplosh The British pound has weakened a little this morning, as investors continue to ponder next month\u2019s EU referendum. Sterling is down almost half a cent against the US dollar, at $1.4601. Despite that, the pound has still been one of the best-performing currencies in May; it strengthened after opinion polls suggested the public will vote to Remain in the EU. But there\u2019s still more than three weeks to go, so everything could change. City traders are taking steps to profit from the vote. As the FT explains this morning, some firms are commissioning their own exit polls on the day, so they can either buy or sell sterling. That\u2019s not illegal, as long as they don\u2019t publish the results.... Unfortunately, the Italian jobs malaise also continues... The Italian unemployment rate has jumped to 11.7% in April, up from 11.5% in March. Economists had expected 11.4%, so this weak reading suggests Mattei Renzi\u2019s government is struggling to breathe life into its labour market. But it\u2019s not all bad new; some 51,000 new positions were created in April, according to the statistics body ISTAT. So the rise in the jobless rate suggests previously inactive workers are now seeking a job. The German jobs miracle continues. Germany\u2019s jobless rate has fallen to a new record low of just 6.1% in May, down from 6.2%. That\u2019s the lowest since East and West Germany were reunified in 1990, as Europe\u2019s largest economy outperforms its weaker neighbours. Reuters has more details: \u201cThe labour market continues its overall positive development,\u201d Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal LabourOffice said in a statement. \u201cUnemployment fell in the course of spring. Employment rose sharply and the demand for labour also increased significantly.\u201d The seasonally-adjusted jobless total fell by 11,000 to2.695 million, the Labour Office said. That compares with a consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for unemployment to fall by 5,000. Unless we get a big crash today, European stock markets will post their best month since last October. The STOXX 600, which tracks the 600 biggest European companies, has gained 2.5% during May as investors put recent market turmoil behind them. This flow of money into shares has come at the expense of other assets, such as precious metals. Gold has fallen by 6% this month, its worst month since November. European stock markets have started the week in an edgy mood. Most of the main indices have dropped, although the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has scrambled a little higher. Traders are waiting for the eurozone data, in an hour\u2019s time. But they\u2019re also pondering the prospect of a US interest rate hike in June or July. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: London\u2019s blue chip index is starting the shortened trading week with some limited gains, helped along by the fact that markets appear increasingly confident that if the Federal Reserve do hike rates again next month, the US economy is now looking strong enough to cope with the fallout. China\u2019s stock market has enjoyed its best day since February. The CSI 300 index closed 3.4%, driven by predictions that the market could soon be included in the MSCI Emerging Markets index (a move which could encourage international investors to hold Chinese shares). But the session was also marked by a curious plunge in the main futures index, which tumbled 10% before immediately jumping back. No-one seems to know what caused the volatility, which is also making investors worried. Bloomberg explains that it could be caused by a single large bet that shares are going ot fall. \u201cLiquidity in the market is really thin at the moment,\u201d Fang Shisheng, Shanghai-based vice general manager at Orient Securities Futures Co., said by phone. \u201cSo the market will very likely see big swings if a big order comes in. The order looks like it\u2019s from a hedger.\u201d German consumers kept their hands in the pockets last month, fuelling concerns that Europe\u2019s largest economy may be in the doldrums. Retail sales fell by 0.9% month-on-month in April, dashing expectations of a 0.9% rise following the 1.4% decline in March. This data is quite volatile, but it does suggest that the German public are being cautious... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a somewhat gloomy feel to the City of London, as traders trudge back to their desks after the bank holiday weekend. That\u2019s partly due to the blanket of cloud sitting over the capital, mocking anyone who\u2019s taken the half-term holiday off. But it also reflects persistent concerns over the global economy as we head towards the summer. Today we\u2019ll get a new healthcheck on the eurozone, with the latest inflation and unemployment data. It may not be too pretty. Economists predict that the consumer prices index inched up to minus 0.1% in May, despite the European Central Bank\u2019s attempts to push up prices. And the jobless rate, for April, may remain pegged at 10.2%; twice as high as in the UK or America. These figures will be scrutinised ahead of the ECB\u2019s next governing council meeting, on Thursday. Traders will also be watching the oil price, ahead of an OPEC meeting on Thursday. And then on Friday, we get the next US unemployment report. That will give fresh clues about whether American interest rates could be hiked over the summer. Here\u2019s the agenda: 8.55am BST: German unemployment report for May 9am: Italian unemployment report for April 10am: Eurozone unemployment report for April 10am: Eurozone flash inflation report for May 1.30pm: Canadian Q1 GDP 3pm: US consumer confidence for May And we\u2019re not expecting any early fireworks in the markets...",

Mixed signals from the US economy also took the shine off shares. Markets had seemingly been taking the prospect of a US rate rise, perhaps as early as June, in their stride, supported by the idea that at least the US economy was showing signs of strength. But ahead of the non-farm payrolls figures due on Friday, weaker consumer confidence and manufacturing figures put a bit of a dent in that theory.</p> <p>There was also some caution ahead of some key events this week. As well as non-farms there is the latest meeting of the European Central Bank and a get-together of Opec ministers.</p> <p><em>So the FTSE 100, which had been heading for a fourth successive monthly rise, actually ended May slightly in the red. But European shares fared better, with the Stoxx 600 index rising 1.7% on the month, its best performance since October.</em></p> <p>With metal prices hit by the stronger dollar, copper declined more than 7% in May, the biggest monthly fall since November.

Most notably, with the FTSE attempting to break out of its 30 point range that has dominated the past week, this could set the groundwork for a very volatile week. Today has seen a substantial amount of data released, and with a whole week of economic data risk ahead, traders will be wary of increased unpredictability in the coming days.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then there is the US data:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At a time when markets have been seemingly focusing on the positives of a stronger economy rather than the looming possibility of a rate hike, today\u2019s data highlights the fact that while a hike is likely, consumers may not feel so optimistic.

Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00f6rnqvist agreed to buy a 43% stake in the company, the fourth largest oil trader in the world, from co-founder Gennady Timchenko in 2014 for an undisclosed fee. Timchenko\u2019s exit was designed to quell any concerns about his role in the company, as he was due to be named in a list of people with alleged links to the Kremlin sanctioned by the US after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. But the sheer size of Gunvor, which pulled in revenues of $64bn (\u00a344bn) last year despite rock-bottom oil prices, meant T\u00f6rnqvist could not fund the deal in one go. The payment of a $1bn dividend, only part of which was used to fund the deal, allowed T\u00f6rnqvist to settle his remaining debt to Timchenko. The transaction initially gave T\u00f6rnqvist a stake of more than 86% but while he took his dividend in cash, employees taking part in the firm\u2019s share plan took theirs in shares. This is understood to be part of a long-term plan to dilute T\u00f6rnqvist\u2019s shareholding over time so that he owns less than 70% of the company. Gunvor said the deal, revealed in the Financial Times, was done in full compliance with the US sanctions regime and disputed a US Treasury statement that Putin has investments in Gunvor and may have access to Gunvor funds. \u201cThe idea that there\u2019s some secret Putin ownership is ridiculous.\u201d Industry sources said if Gunvor was in breach of US rules on businesses with links to the Kremlin it would already be facing sanctions.",

    "webTitle": "VW profits down 20% after diesel emissions scandal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen\u2019s profit tumbled nearly 20% at the start of this year as car sales continued to fall in the wake of the diesel emissions scandal. The German carmaker made a profit before tax of \u20ac3.2bn (\u00a32.4bn) in the three months to March, down from nearly \u20ac4bn a year earlier. Revenues were down 3.4% to \u20ac51bn due to a decline in vehicle sales and negative exchange rate effects, the company said. In April, VW recorded its first annual loss in more than 20 years for 2015, after more than doubling the amount set aside to pay for costs related to the scandal to \u20ac16.2bn. The carmaker admitted last September it had installed software to cheat US emissions tests in 11m diesel vehicles. Under a deal struck with the US Department of Justice in December, the carmaker will buy back almost 500,000 cars and compensate owners. But the company has said a similar arrangement will not be introduced in Europe, where looser requirements on diesel emissions mean less work needs to be done on affected vehicles. Matthias M\u00fcller, VW\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIn light of the wide range of challenges we are currently facing, we are satisfied overall with the start we have made to what will undoubtedly be a demanding fiscal year 2016. In the first quarter, we once again managed to limit the economic effects of the diesel issue and achieve respectable results under difficult conditions.\u201d VW shares initially dropped as much as 3% in Frankfurt, and were later trading 1.5% lower at \u20ac135.90. VW-branded cars have been worst-hit by the scandal. Operating profits plunged to \u20ac73m from \u20ac514m a year earlier. The Audi brand fared better, with sales and profits just slightly below last year\u2019s levels , while Porsche, the Czech brand \u0160koda and the Spanish marque Seat delivered higher sales and operating profits. The company stuck to its forecast of a fall of up to 5% in 2016 group revenues compared with last year, \u201cdepending on economic conditions \u2013 particularly in South America and Russia \u2013 and exchange rate developments as well as against the backdrop of the diesel issue\u201d. It is expecting a \u201cmarked decrease\u201d in passenger car sales revenues. M\u00fcller said: \u201c2016 will be a transitional year for Volkswagen that will see us fundamentally realign the group.\u201d Experts said the fact that Volkswagen was still making a profit showed that customers cared less about the emissions scandal than expected. When the scandal broke, the expectation was that the carmaker would struggle to survive. Prof Christian Stadler at Warwick Business School said: \u201cUnder the circumstances a \u20ac3.2bn profit is not bad. Although rivals Toyota reported substantially higher profits of \u20ac4.5bn that was aided by a weak yen.

Revenues were down 3.4% to \u20ac51bn due to a decline in vehicle sales and negative exchange rate effects, the company said.</p> <p>In April, VW recorded<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/22/volkswagen-takes-16bn-euro-hit-for-diesel-scandal-as-it-makes-4bn-euro-loss\"> its first annual loss in more than 20 years</a> for 2015, after more than doubling the amount set aside to pay for costs related to the scandal to \u20ac16.2bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/14/vw-sharan-se-nav-car-review-more-well-than-you-think\">VW Sharan SE Nav 2.0 TDI car review \u2013 \u2018It has more welly than you\u2019d think\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2015/sep/24/vw-volkswagen-diesel-emissions-carmaker-why-video\">The carmaker admitted last September it had installed software</a> to cheat US emissions tests in 11m diesel vehicles. Under a deal struck with the US Department of Justice in December, the carmaker will buy back almost 500,000 cars and compensate owners. But the company has said a similar arrangement will not be introduced in Europe, where looser requirements on diesel emissions mean less work needs to be done on affected vehicles.</p> <p>Matthias M\u00fcller, VW\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIn light of the wide range of challenges we are currently facing, we are satisfied overall with the start we have made to what will undoubtedly be a demanding fiscal year 2016. In the first quarter, we once again managed to limit the economic effects of the diesel issue and achieve respectable results under difficult conditions.\u201d</p> <p>VW shares initially dropped as much as 3% in Frankfurt, and were later trading 1.5% lower at \u20ac135.90. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94b5e33340eb88e82c0905d3f44b03f0b9408fe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94b5e33340eb88e82c0905d3f44b03f0b9408fe7/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthias M\u00fcller said VW was limiting the economic effects of \u2018the diesel issue\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthias M\u00fcller said VW was limiting the economic effects of \u2018the diesel issue\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>VW-branded cars have been worst-hit by the scandal. Operating profits plunged to \u20ac73m from \u20ac514m a year earlier. The Audi brand fared better, with sales and profits just slightly below last year\u2019s levels , while Porsche, the Czech brand \u0160koda and the Spanish marque Seat delivered higher sales and operating profits.</p> <p>The company stuck to its forecast of a fall of up to 5% in 2016 group revenues compared with last year, \u201cdepending on economic conditions \u2013 particularly in South America and Russia \u2013 and exchange rate developments as well as against the backdrop of the diesel issue\u201d. It is expecting a \u201cmarked decrease\u201d in passenger car sales revenues.</p> <p>M\u00fcller said: \u201c2016 will be a transitional year for Volkswagen that will see us fundamentally realign the group.\u201d</p> <p>Experts said the fact that Volkswagen was still making a profit showed that customers cared less about the emissions scandal than expected. When the scandal broke, the expectation was that the carmaker would struggle to survive.</p> <p>Prof Christian Stadler at Warwick Business School said: \u201cUnder the circumstances a \u20ac3.2bn profit is not bad.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former chief executive of Zurich Insurance has killed himself, the company said on Monday, less than three years after the company\u2019s chief financial officer also took his own life. The death of Martin Senn, 59, takes the number of suicides by executives at Switzerland\u2019s biggest companies to five in just eight years. Senn was chief executive of Zurich in 2013 when Pierre Wauthier, the insurer\u2019s chief financial officer, killed himself. Zurich, Switzerland\u2019s biggest insurer, said it was \u201cstunned and deeply shaken\u201d by the death of Senn, who was chief executive between 2010 and 2015. In a statement it said: \u201cMartin Senn\u2019s family has informed us that Martin committed suicide last Friday. With Martin, we lose not only a commendable former CEO and valued former colleague, but also a good-hearted friend. Our thoughts are with his family, to whom we express our deepest condolences. \u201cOut of respect for Martin and out of consideration for the family, we will not make any further comment.\u201d Police in the canton of Grisons confirmed they had responded to a case but gave no further details. Senn resigned from the company on 1 December last year after a failed takeover bid for the British insurer RSA and a series of profit warnings. Zurich walked away from the \u00a35.6bn deal after suffering \u00a3175m of losses from an explosion at the Chinese port of Tianjin and problems in its US car insurance division. At the company\u2019s annual meeting in 2014, Senn spoke about the death of Wauthier. \u201cThe grief and shock we experienced at the suicide of our colleague Pierre Wauthier was enormous,\u201d he said. The suicide prompted a company-wide inquiry into workplace pressure, with Zurich\u2019s then chairman, Josef Ackermann, resigning after he was named in Wauthier\u2019s suicide note. The note, addressed \u201cto whom it may concern\u201d described how Wauthier had become demoralised by what he called a new, more aggressive tone at Zurich. Two independent investigations directed by Swiss regulators found no indication he had been subject to undue pressure by decision-makers at the company. Wauthier\u2019s widow and children, however, lashed out at the company in an address at its annual meeting directed at the chairman, Tom de Swaan. \u201cYou stated last week that Zurich has improved,\u201d they said. \u201cWe sincerely wish we could believe you for the sake of the people inside your corporation. But the way you handled Pierre\u2019s suicide is a sign that unaccountability remains part of Zurich\u2019s corporate culture.\u201d Switzerland\u2019s business community has been rocked by a series of suicides since Alex Widmer, the chief executive of private bank Julius Baer, killed himself in 2008 as the financial crash loomed. Swisscom\u2019s boss Carsten Schloter killed himself in 2013 after telling interviewers that he found it increasingly difficult to switch off outside work because he owned a smartphone. \u201cThe most dangerous thing is to fall into a mode of permanent activity and continuously consult one\u2019s smartphone to see whether any new mails have come in,\u201d he told Swiss newspaper Schweiz am Sonntag. \u201cEveryone should switch off their mobile phone from time to time.\u201d Asked whether he found it possible to ignore his phone, he said: \u201cNo, I must say that I find it increasingly difficult to calm down and to reduce tempo. Perhaps that has something to do with age.\u201d He also lamented a lack of \u201cwindows\u201d in which he could unwind, saying: \u201cIt makes you feel as if you are being strangled.\u201d Adrian Kohler, the boss of the herbal sweets company Ricola, killed himself in 2011 two days after confessing financial irregularities to fellow board members. In 2014, a study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry concluded that the financial crisis was a factor in 10,000 suicides. Experts from the University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said suicide rates in Europe rose by 6.5% between 2007 and 2009 and remained higher than usual until 2011. \u2022 In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here.",

Perhaps that has something to do with age.\u201d</p> <p>He also lamented a lack of \u201cwindows\u201d in which he could unwind, saying: \u201cIt makes you feel as if you are being strangled.\u201d</p> <p>Adrian Kohler, the boss of the herbal sweets company Ricola, killed himself in 2011 two days after confessing financial irregularities to fellow board members.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In 2014, a study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry concluded that the financial crisis was a factor in 10,000 suicides.</p> <p>Experts from the University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said suicide rates in Europe rose by 6.5% between 2007 and 2009 and remained higher than usual until 2011.<br></p> <p><em>\u2022 In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

      "bodyText": "Despite a dip during the morning, the FTSE 100 is set for its fourth monthly rise in a row even though investors are still cautious about the state of the global economy. An early rise followed news of a positive performance from China - which shrugged off a brief but hefty flash crash to enjoy its best day since February. Dealers pointed to suggestions that mainland Chinese stocks would soon be included in the MSCI global indices. There was also speculation that Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe might postpone next year\u2019s scheduled sales tax rise until late 2019, which helped sentiment. But there is some hesitation ahead of a number of key events this week, not least the European Central Bank\u2019s latest meeting and the US non-farm payroll figures, the last before the Federal Reserve interest rate decision in June. Overall the FTSE 100 has slipped 12.22 points to 6258.57. Anglo American has edged 1.3p lower to 610.7p despite a report in the Australian that Glencore, down 1.1p at 133.2p was planning to team up with private equity group Apollo to bid for Anglo\u2019s Grosvenor and Moranbah coal mines in Queensland. With Brent crude down 0.84% at $49.34 ahead of an Opec meeting this week and the continuing strength of the dollar on rate rise expectations, other commodity companies are also lower. BHP Billiton is down 15.2p at 825.1p while BP has fallen 6.5p to 355.45p. Among the mid-caps Alliance Trust has added 17.5p to 526p as RIT Capital made an informal merger approach. Zoopla Property is up 8.3p at 328.8p as analysts at Jefferies issued a buy note after the online portal\u2019s positive first half update last week. Lifting its price target from 415p to 430p, Jefferies said: Zoopla is leading rather than following the market as it seeks to be the \u2018one stop shop\u2019 for the homebuyer, the Amazon of UK residential, with services ranging across property to tradesmen to utilities. In our view, two catalysts are likely to lead to a material re-rating of Zoopla\u2019s shares in the coming months: the continued decline of challenger portal, \u2018On The Market\u2019 (Zoopla has now had 12 consecutive months of agency customer growth) and the Capital Markets Day on 15 September 2016, which will lift the curtain on the future strategy of Zoopla and its recent acquisitions of uSwitch and PSG. We continue to have very high conviction on Zoopla. In our view, the strategy is logical and commercial and it is working. Strong performance from uSwitch drives our upgrades today as we believe that Zoopla is entering a prolonged purple patch and we have yet to see the real benefits of PSG, which, in our view, will provide traditional agents significant firepower as the agency battlefield moves from the high street to the cloud.",

      "bodyText": "A Brisbane student has successfully challenged his union\u2019s workplace agreement with Coles supermarket, potentially forcing the company to renegotiate the wages and conditions of tens of thousands of employees. Duncan Hart, who works at the supermarket part-time, had argued the agreement struck with Coles in 2015 by the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) had left the 77,000 workers it covered worse off than under the award. An enterprise bargaining agreement (EBA) can be registered with Fair Work Australia only if it leaves each worker better off overall, which Coles and the SDA had said was the case when the industrial umpire approved the deal in July. But the commission on Tuesday ruled in Hart\u2019s favour, finding a cut in penalty rates contained in the deal had left a substantial number of workers worse off. \u201cFor some employees, particularly those who work primarily at times which attract lower penalty rates under the agreement when compared to the award, the monetary loss is potentially significant,\u201d the commission said. An analysis of Hart\u2019s September roster showed the student could have been up to $2,504 worse off each year under the deal. Coles and the SDA had argued the EBA had balanced the lower penalty rates by increasing the hourly base rate, extending meal and rest breaks and introducing new leave options, among other provisions. The commission agreed these concessions were in workers\u2019 favour \u201cbut the level of benefit is not large\u201d. \u201cWe are not satisfied that a consideration of all benefits and detriments under the agreement results in each employee and each prospective employee being better off overall under the agreement compared to the award,\u201d the commission said. Coles has until 10 June to remedy the agreement. A Fairfax Media investigation in 2015 found the SDA \u2013 which champions a socially conservative agenda, including opposition to marriage equality \u2013 pays up to $5m a year to major employers to cover the cost of payroll deductions of union fees. \u201cThe decision today recognises that while some changes need to be made, the agreement as a whole is solid,\u201d Gerard Dwyer, the SDA\u2019s national secretary, said. \u201cThis was always a technical debate about a small cohort of workers who may have inadvertently missed out on the significant improvements that the vast majority of Coles workers would have secured under this agreement.\u201d Coles said its workplace agreements had \u201cconsistently delivered wage rises ahead of inflation, at the same time as we have lowered prices for our customers\u201d. \u201cColes\u2019 current agreement was approved by the Fair Work Commission in 2015. It delivered an average increase of 3% in base rates, maintained penalty rates from the previous agreement and brought six complex agreements into a simple, easy to understand document,\u201d the company said. \u201cColes has constructively engaged in the Fair Work Commission\u2019s process and will respond to today\u2019s decision in due course.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On its last full day of trading, the Ladbrokes betting shop in Morden, south-west London, stayed open until 10 at night. It was Friday 24 May 2013, the beginning of one of those spring-summer weekends for which the schedules of global sport combine to throw up a glut of events that can be gambled on. A European football final, a super-middleweight title fight, a Grand Prix, high-season horse races, a golf tournament. The manager of the Morden Ladbrokes, a 55-year-old Londoner named Andrew Iacovou, sat behind his shop\u2019s counter with a computer, a scroll printer, a coin tray and, beside his knees, a safe \u2013 waiting to take bets. A balding and naturally slight man who spent his free hours in the gym, Iacovou had worked for Ladbrokes for more than 20 years. Quiet but not unconfident and well liked by his regular customers, he was one of the company\u2019s 15,500 employees, around 11,000 of whom worked in Ladbrokes\u2019 2,200 shops. Iacovou had run a Ladbrokes in Wimbledon, a Ladbrokes in Earlsfield and another Ladbrokes in Morden before moving to his current branch, a glass-fronted shop next to a supermarket, just across the A24 from Morden tube. For more than two decades with the firm, he had seen through changes to the staff uniform (tomato-red polo shirts, now) as well as a series of dispiriting adjustments to his daily workload. In the 1990s, when Iacovou first met his wife, Anita, then a Post Office employee, he worked at the Wimbledon branch. It shut to customers at 5.30pm and Iacovou would close down the premises by 6pm, ready to walk Anita home. His Morden branch, in 2013, was open seven days a week, from 8.30am or 9am until 10pm. Iacovou generally worked five of those days, sometimes six, often from start to finish. For some hours in the afternoon he would be joined at the till by an assistant, a cashier who helped him process handwritten bets that came in over the counter. Otherwise, Iacovou manned the shop alone, relying on his regulars for company. They were mostly male, mostly retired, often on their way to or from the nearby Ganley\u2019s pub. There was a rosy-faced man in his 60s, called Michael, who sat at a shop kiosk and frowned at length over his spread-out betting slips, ruminating before committing to a day\u2019s wagers. There was a taxi driver, Alan the Taxi, who parked in the rank outside and came in to bet the occasional \u00a35 on football. A fellow cabbie, John the Taxi, didn\u2019t gamble, but he came in and out to use the loo. Both drivers brought with them takeaway coffees for Iacovou, who could not leave the shop unless his cashier was there. The branch had a regular named Ray, who bet horses, and Kistensamy, who bet horses, and Bill, who only bet dogs. There was a relative newcomer, Shafique Aarij, a man in his 20s with pocked skin who had drawn attention to himself by combing his hair, nervously, whenever he played on one of the shop\u2019s electronic gambling machines. That Friday, Aarij complained to the manager about a problem with one of these machines. Iacovou had to come out from behind his counter to see what was wrong. It was one of dozens of menial but mounting tasks he had to see to: filling the coupon trays; scissoring out form guides from the Racing Post and arranging them on magnetic display boards; alternating posters in the street-facing windows; managing customers who approached his till holding winning slips (and those who came anyway, as losers, to moan); monitoring the amount of money in the coin tray, in the till, and in the safe; monitoring the door, in case someone too young or too unsavoury-looking should try to enter; monitoring the shop\u2019s four gambling machines, in case any of them should break down, the colours on the simulated casino games turn funny or the calibration on the touchscreens slip out of sync. At the end of the day these machines had to be laboriously emptied of takings and the shop otherwise shut down. Though Iacovou\u2019s branch closed to customers at 10, that night he did not get back to his home in Cheam until midnight. He was exhausted, his wife recalled, and he slept in his uniform. In the morning, Iacovou took the bus back to the Morden branch, arriving at around 8am, in time to meet a colleague from another Ladbrokes who had come to collect a set of spare keys. The pair chatted briefly. There had been a time when they might have been rostered to spend Saturday together in the shop, but no longer. Iacovou was not expecting his cashier to arrive until after lunch. The managers said goodbye to each other and Iacovou began to prepare for trade, turning on the machines and checking that each of their coin and note slots were functioning properly. He put up pages from the Racing Post and took out cleaning products to tidy his counter area. The posters in the street-facing window that morning said \u201cWin\u201d, \u201cFREE BET\u201d, \u201cGuaranteed\u201d, \u201cDebit cards accepted\u201d. Iacovou opened a locked door that separated the shop floor from his service area and sat down at his till. As it turned 8.30am, he pressed a button to unseal the shop\u2019s magnetically locked front door, and was open for business. The first customer was Shafique Aarij. That morning he was carrying a shoulder bag. He went to one of the gambling machines. As had happened the day before, Aarij signalled to Iacovou that there was a problem with his machine. The manager stood up and started to unlock the door beside his counter. As soon as the latch was turned, Aarij pushed in. He grabbed Iacovou around the neck. The two men struggled. Aarij took a claw hammer from his bag and struck Iacovou over the head with it. He struck again, and again, and then he turned his attention to the safe. 2. A part of British life It is a rare British high street that has not come to be kitted out, today, in the colours of the bookmakers. In every town, on every retail row, the routine sweep of bank and salon and shrunken supermarket will be studded at almost mathematical intervals by the red of a Ladbrokes storefront or the blue and yellow of a William Hill, likely as well by the blue of a Coral, the blue and red of a Betfred, the pale green of a Stan James or the clover-leaf shade of a Paddy Power. In total, there are around 9,000 licensed betting shops in the UK, around half of those operated by Ladbrokes and William Hill. The two corporations are great and bitter rivals, tracing a contempt for one another back to the 1930s. Difficult as it is to credit now, both companies once shared a snotty attitude about the idea of bookmakers having shops. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be very nice,\u201d said Mr William Hill, founder of William Hill, in 1956, \u201cto see at every street corner a betting shop.\u201d There was never a Mr Ladbrokes; the company was named for a country house where its founders trained horses in the 1880s. Up to the 1960s it reckoned itself too posh for street-level trade. Bookmakers at the time operated under licence only at racetracks, or took bets from private customers by post or telephone. Profits made in this way were undermined by a thriving black market in illegal street betting. Before the tonnes of lurid acrylic got hoisted into place on shop fronts nationwide, British bookmaking had as its most visible identifier a lone man or boy, waiting with a satchel of money on any street corner that had a choice of escape routes. Betting shops were legalised in 1961. A year later, the Times audited the country, describing the first bookmakers\u2019 shops, and reporting on the genteel (a \u201cclean, sky-blue parlour\u201d) as well as the already run-down (a \u201cseedy, litter-strewn room containing listless youths sucking pencils\u201d). All had windows that were blacked out, at government insistence, to discourage loitering. An employee known as a \u201cmarker\u201d would stand by a blackboard, close to a telephone or later a loudspeaker that broadcast racing commentary, chalking up results. Another employee, called a \u201csettler\u201d, calculated odds in their head. Cashiers took in money and sometimes gave it out. Customers could not drink in betting shops, but they could smoke. These were bolt-holes, very often in the backstreets, stuffy but social, somewhere to be. And they were popular, particularly with working-class men. Once Ladbrokes and William Hill could not ignore the potential profits any longer, they began to open branches, or take over existing ones, and from the mid-1960s on, the two companies\u2019 spread was rapid and aggressive. Between them they absorbed dozens of smaller now-forgotten firms \u2013 Solomons &amp; Flanagan, JJ Simonds, Ken Munden, Fred Parkinson. William Hill had 100 shops by 1970, and Ladbrokes more than 400. \u201cThey are part of British life now,\u201d said Hill not long before he died. His company was bought by Sears Holdings Limited in 1971, and then traded on again through a number of conglomerates. Both William Hill and Ladbrokes became PLCs, floated on the stock market. They had 1,000 shops each, then 2,000. Wooden writing benches, pencilled over with decades\u2019 worth of redundant figuring, were removed from branches and replaced by plasticky kiosks. Instead of pencils came that icon of the modern betting shop, the complimentary pen: stubby, flat edged, much-chucked in frustration, apparently of limitless supply. Regulation changes in the 1980s allowed TVs to be installed in shops, bringing in races and results direct from horse and greyhound tracks. (That killed the role of the fast-chalking \u201cmarkers\u201d.) Cashiers, in the 1990s, got networked computers. (Thus the \u201csettlers\u201d also became redundant.) Plinky, pound-at-a-time fruit machines came in and then, around the turn of the millennium, the first modern gambling machines \u2013 \u201cfixed-odds betting terminals\u201d, or FOBTs (pronounced fobtees), offering a digitised version of roulette as well as other arcade-style games that could be gambled on. The major bookmakers also launched and invested in dotcom operations, but they were not especially light-footed about it, and their profits were eaten into by an online-only service named Betfair that empowered its customers to act as bookies themselves, setting odds and taking bets from one another. Takings fell. At around the same time, betting on the industry\u2019s totemic sports, horse racing and greyhound racing, dropped away. Staff observed that a younger generation of gambler had come to see track racing as jargon-heavy, too favourable to those with specialist knowledge \u2013 dad\u2019s fancy \u2013 and they preferred to bet on football instead. Broadly speaking, there was less profit for bookmakers there: in football, unlike in a 15- or 30-rider horse race, only one side could fail to win. Takings fell further. A new piece of legislation, the 2005 Gambling Act, had enforced a limit of four FOBTs per betting shop. The money fed into these four machines became ever more important to each shop\u2019s viability. Like characters in a certain type of sci-fi film, veteran staff now speak of a happier time \u2013 \u201cbefore the machines\u201d. FOBTs, when they came, were accepting of much larger sums than the fruit machines that preceded them. Up to \u00a3100 could be fed in and gambled every 20 seconds, an amount later curbed, under changing government regulations, to \u00a350 every 20 seconds. Losers lost faster, and losing became an identifiably scratchier thing. Staff explained: the customer who backed a too-slow horse or a crap dog might afterwards rail at fate or the gods, or even the employees behind their counters. But they could not plausibly claim to have been cheated. Machine players brought with them a new paranoia. FOBTs are fixed, thus the name \u2013 fixed-odds betting terminals. Over time they will pay back to customers 97.4% of the money that is put into them. Even so, it became a common thing for staff to be accused of rigging equipment, of dialling up losing streaks, of modulating people\u2019s electronic luck. Many shop workers I spoke to had stories about looking on, impotent, as the machines under their charge were angrily destroyed by the customers who had been playing them. Worse, somehow, was when a machine was calmly destroyed. The deputy manager of a William Hill in Hull said: \u201cYou just watch, there\u2019s nothing else to do. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s normal for people to smash up the shop.\u201d (A representative of William Hill said this was \u201crare\u201d.) A woman working at an Oxfordshire Ladbrokes told me she had watched all four FOBTs in her shop get wrecked by a man swinging a stool; by the next day\u2019s trade, she said, her ruined machines had all been replaced. According to figures I have seen, the number of incidents of damage to machines in Ladbrokes branches rose steadily between 2010 and 2015. A senior figure at Ladbrokes during this period became increasingly concerned by the situation at shop-level \u201cgetting silly, getting crazy\u201d. They told me it was their belief that with the introduction of the machines, betting shops had more or less become \u201cmini casinos\u201d. And how many casinos, they asked, got by without bouncers to cope with aggrieved gamblers? How many were run by individuals on their own? 3. Work alone, or don\u2019t work Even after the markers were made redundant by TV, and the settlers run off by desktop computers, it was rare for employees to work in their betting shops alone; until it wasn\u2019t. While staff at William Hill were told by company bosses, often and emphatically, that they would not be asked to man branches by themselves at night, Ladbrokes began to draw up what it called a \u201csingle-scheduling\u201d policy in 2010. The policy meant that, subject to certain conditions, including a risk assessment of individual branches and a tick-box check of employee competence, shops could be run by one person for periods of the day and night. In fact, in the majority of shops, there would be a mandatory number of hours during which there could only be one person rostered to work. Single-manning, as staff started to call it, was trialled and then expanded around Ladbrokes\u2019 betting shops between 2011 and 2013. People at all levels of the company told me they were in no doubt as to why it was introduced. \u201cIt was a cost-cutting exercise,\u201d said an area manager who was then in charge of 15 branches in the south-east. A senior person in Ladbrokes\u2019 retail department at the time told me: \u201cThey recognised there were considerable savings to be made. Why double-man a shop between 10am and 1pm, or after 6pm, when it\u2019s quiet?\u201d Another well-placed source inside Ladbrokes at the time said they believed that by reducing staff from two to one in more than 2,000 shops, the company saved approximately \u00a315m a year. The Mirror reported that between 2009 and 2011, Ladbrokes\u2019 annual wage bill dropped by a third. (Ladbrokes said this was a result of cuts in staffing at all levels, not specifically on shop floors.) At shop level, a choice: work on your own, or risk your job. An area manager who worked in the north and oversaw the running of more than 60 branches told the 200-odd employees under his charge: \u201cWe can either close this amount of shops and make this amount of people redundant, or we can single-man.\u201d The area manager remembered \u201ca lot of emotion. A lot of staff felt it wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d (Ladbrokes acknowledged that \u201csome of our employees have strong opinions on working alone\u201d and said it encouraged feedback.) Though most shops would still be able to budget for a second employee \u2013 a cashier on minimum wage \u2013 during the busier afternoon horse-racing hours, most Ladbrokes\u2019 shop staff could now expect to work alone before midday and after 6pm. At first, those who agreed to single-man were paid extra \u2013 something like an additional 40p an hour. (The hourly pay for branch managers, who are known internally at Ladbrokes as customer service managers, varies by area and age. In 2016, for a 23-year-old in the Wirral, it is \u00a38.51 per hour.) A source inside Ladbrokes\u2019 head office at the time pointed out that the additional money was soon stopped. Internal Ladbrokes sources spoke candidly to me on the condition that I not use their names. So did most of the dozens of betting shop workers I consulted for this story. Entering branches around the UK, and introducing myself as a reporter, I became used to a singular response: behind the counter their eyes would flick, instinctively, to the nearest CCTV camera. Employees said they feared the sack if they complained in public forums about their working conditions. A Ladbrokes branch manager in Wales said that, when she posted a comment on Facebook in reference to the attack on Andrew Iacovou in Morden, she was contacted within 20 minutes by the firm\u2019s London office and told to delete it or she would enter a disciplinary process. A Ladbrokes employee in Birmingham reported the same. Many of the part-time-working students and other junior staff I interviewed insisted they did not expect to be in their jobs for ever, that a pervasive industry gloom would soon flush them out \u2013 but that they needed good references, so could their names be left out of my story? I met working parents, working parents-to-be, second-generation staff who worked in branches with their parents, and other employees who could not risk dismissal, so asked to speak anonymously. But they spoke. The area manager in the north recalled his shame at telling staff who were unnerved by single-manning in its early phase that they were really in no extra danger. Back then, said the area manager, \u201cI supported the company line, telling my staff: \u2018We need to do this.\u2019\u201d He told any staff who felt unsafe working alone that \u201cif there is a robbery, as long as you hand over all the money, it\u2019s unlikely the robbers will do anything to you. You\u2019re probably at no more risk of a robbery on your own than you are with two people.\u201d A senior figure at Ladbrokes told me that, from the introduction of single-manning in 2010 until the end of 2014, the company kept no figures recording whether a branch was single- or double-manned at the time of a criminal incident. For a time, said the area manager in the north, single-manning \u201cseemed pretty innocuous\u201d. Persuading his staff became easier when other major betting chains started to single-man. Employees at Betfred, Stan James, Coral and Paddy Power told me they were all asked to work in their shops alone on a frequent basis. \u201cFor a while it did work fine,\u201d said the area manager. \u201cAnd then Andrew Iacovou happened.\u201d 4. The Morden branch Andrew and Anita Iacovou first met inside a Ladbrokes. It was a Saturday in April 1995, Grand National weekend. Anita had put an each-way bet on a horse called Party Politics. \u201cIntuition,\u201d she said. When her horse finished second, she took her ticket to Iacovou, who was working behind the counter. They started talking. Iacovou was 37 and had grown up not far away, in South Norwood. His father was Greek and his mother English. Anita was 34, second-generation Indian, with dark hair that she tied back in a knot. Iacovou must have been distracted, chatting, because he shorted Anita on her winnings. When she went back to check \u2013 \u00a333, wasn\u2019t it? \u2013 Iacovou asked her out. They married in 1999 and later had two sons. In 2005, the family moved to a flat in Cheam. For five years, until 2010, Iacovou worked at a Ladbrokes a walk away, on Tudor Drive. Then he was moved to the branch near Morden tube. \u201cHe told me he didn\u2019t feel safe there,\u201d Anita recalled. Twice, during Iacovou\u2019s evening shifts, the windows of his branch were broken by vandals. Anita\u2019s brother, Anil Punjabi, sometimes drove Anita and her sons to pick him up after work. But after a while, Punjabi recalled, Iacovou asked him not to bring the family on these trips, fearing they would be vulnerable in the car outside. The sensation of safety is not a hard currency; it cannot be passed around in token form. The Morden Ladbrokes had CCTV cameras inside it, a steel-framed front door with a magnetic lock, a latch-lock on the door between the shop floor and the service area, and an employee panic button under the counter. As dozens of shop employees pointed out to me, however, it is still possible to feel unsafe in the middle of a fortress like this, particularly at night, particularly when unaccompanied. The deputy manager of a Betfred in Sussex was working on her own when one night she was threatened with rape by a frustrated machine gambler. \u201cHe told me: \u2018You\u2019d like it.\u2019 I remember thinking: \u2018There\u2019s nowhere I can run.\u2019\u201d The Betfred deputy rang the police that night, and again the following night, and again the night after that, because the same man kept returning to the shop as soon as her assistant cashier left for the evening. For a while she took anti-anxiety medication, she said, to be able to keep working, and then she resigned. A female Ladbrokes worker in Oxfordshire recalled being told by a customer: \u201cI\u2019m going to come back at 10 o\u2019clock, when you close, and take you.\u201d She was 19. Employees, particularly women \u2013 of whom the betting-shop industry has an unusually high number, around 50% in branches \u2013 told me they had often asked husbands or friends to sit in shops with them on evenings they were rostered to work alone. Certain branches in certain areas were from the start deemed too dangerous to be single-manned. The neighbourhood around Andrew Iacovou\u2019s Morden shop was not judged by Ladbrokes\u2019 risk-assessment team to present any special danger. Part of the way Ladbrokes decided this was by considering unpleasant incidents that had already taken place inside a shop. It rated such incidents by degree. Verbal abuse from a customer was a \u201clevel one\u201d; physical abuse a \u201clevel two\u201d; physical abuse that resulted in hospitalisation a \u201clevel three\u201d. Suffer enough twos or threes and head office would take a shop off the single-manning list, at least for a short while. Andrew Iacovou\u2019s Morden branch had not had enough level twos or level threes. Anita worried for her husband. You did not have to search especially hard for stories about violence in British betting shops at the time. A machete robbery at a Betfred in Ashton-in-Makerfield in March 2013. A man who had entered a Ladbrokes in Southampton in April 2013, and leapt over the counter with a kitchen knife. Between them, the Iacovous had an arrangement: Andrew would call Anita from his shop, usually at about 8.30am, when he would have settled in, and then again at intervals through the day. On Saturday 25 May, Anita did not receive the expected call. She rang the shop and got no answer. She continued to call. Trying to work out what had happened later, police investigators rewatched CCTV footage recorded in the shop. They saw Shafique Aarij struggle with Iacovou behind the counter. This was at 8.33am. They saw Aarij hit Iacovou with a hammer, multiple times. Blood spotted his face, and he wiped at it. Within minutes of the attack Aarij had left the shop. Examining the shop\u2019s safe, police saw that its handle had received a hammer blow, but had remained locked. They knew from shop records that \u00a3296.86 had disappeared from the till. Aarij must have taken this when he fled, at around 8.35am. 8.45am. 9am. 9.15am. For between 45 minutes and an hour, nobody outside the Morden branch was aware that anything unusual had happened inside. Andrew Iacovou lay in such a way behind his counter that he could not be seen from the shop floor. Customers came and went. Someone played on one of the machines. Eventually Kistensamy, one of the regulars, approached the counter and saw a body. He ran to the supermarket next door and raised the alarm. An ambulance came. Iacovou was pronounced dead by paramedics at 10.28am. 5. \u201cA tough year\u201d From branch to branch, rumours of a murder spread. Staff at a William Hill in Glasgow heard that an employee had been stabbed. At a Coral in Hemel Hempstead it was said that someone had been shot. In a Facebook group for industry professionals (the group is called \u201cI No Longer Fear Hell, I\u2019ve Worked in a Betting Shop\u201d and has over 14,000 members) Iacovou was discussed within hours of his death. \u201cWhat happened? Robbery gone wrong? Was he single-manning?\u201d The suggestion that Iacovou had lain undiscovered for so long was especially distressing to people. This was one of their great fears. In the Facebook group, a discussion about possible strike action led nowhere. A hopeless, gravedigger humour set in instead. \u201cIf you\u2019re single-manning and something happens,\u201d someone asked, \u201cwho will call for help?\u201d Someone replied: \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d Members discussed the wild inconsistency with which glass security screens were installed in shops, many premises going without (\u201cShow me one bank that doesn\u2019t have them for cash transactions\u201d). They compared notes about how easily a magnetically sealed front door could be forced by a determined intruder (\u201cI weigh 11 stone and \u2026 \u201d). They remembered the old days (\u201cI started in \u201994 \u2026 home by 5.30pm in the winter\u201d) and exchanged grim warnings about the future (\u201cNext time it could be any one of you\u201d). One especially distressing rumour about Iacovou spread between them: that before he died, the manager had been able to press the panic alarm beneath his counter, and that this alarm, while it had registered at Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office, had somehow gone unanswered. I was told by well-placed sources that this rumour was accurate. When the alarm registered at Ladbrokes\u2019 security office, a live CCTV feed from the shop was checked by a control room operator; but the operator saw only Aarij, not Iacovou. The operator also saw the cleaning materials that Iacovou had put out on his service area. It was assumed that Aarij was a cleaner who must have pressed the panic button by mistake. (A Ladbrokes spokesperson said that after this killing, \u201cchanges were made with regard to how our security control room responds to incidents\u201d.) In Cheam, Anita Iacovou heard nothing all morning. At 2pm, police visited her at the flat. Ladbrokes\u2019 security chief came too, as did a second Ladbrokes\u2019 representative. Anita was asked to step in to her bedroom to speak with a policewoman. Anita said, instinctively: \u201cHe\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d The policewoman said no, Andrew was dead. Anita said, \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d and the policewoman said no. The two children were at home. Anita called them into the room to tell them what had happened. There is not a lot more she can recall of the afternoon. She knows she turned to the two Ladbrokes representatives, in the family living room, and asked: why was he ever left there alone? Aarij, 21, was found by police five days later, hiding at a friend\u2019s home in east London. When interviewed at Sutton police station, Aarij accepted that he had gone to the betting shop in Morden that morning to steal money. That he had armed himself with a hammer beforehand. That he knew there was likely to be only one person on duty. When police asked why he had killed Iacovou, Aarij told them: \u201cWhen the siren was ringing I got scared and I became upset and then I was not in my senses.\u201d Police charged Aarij with murder. At trial in November 2013 he was found guilty. In January 2014 he was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum of 26 years. Ladbrokes paid a modest sum to Anita Iacovou and her family. (A well-placed source put it at \u00a3140,000.) Ladbrokes also launched a JustGiving page in Iacovou\u2019s memory, kicking off donations with \u00a310,000. The company paid for Iacovou\u2019s funeral, in July 2013. During Aarij\u2019s murder trial, Ladbrokes arranged for taxis to take Anita and her family to and from court. In its December report for shareholders, the company described 2013 as \u201ca tough year\u201d. Delicate mention was made of the murder. It was called \u201ca random violent attack\u201d. The area manager in the north recalled: \u201cThe thinking was we sell it as a one-in-a-million anomaly that can never happen again.\u201d A senior figure at Ladbrokes at the time confirmed this. \u201cThose were conversations that were being had at senior level. It was taken as: \u2018The shell doesn\u2019t land in the same place twice.\u2019\u201d Another senior figure at Ladbrokes at the time said: \u201cThere was a naivety.\u201d Shortly after Morden, an internal investigation was launched, and Ladbrokes\u2019 single-scheduling policy found to be adequate. When a new branch opened in the Leicester area that year, it was added, like hundreds of others, to the list of Ladbrokes that could be run by one person. In early 2014, a woman in her 20s was interviewed for a job at the branch. A court later imposed restrictions on the reporting of this woman\u2019s name \u2013 she would come to be known internally at the company as Miss X. During her interview, Miss X asked about the possibility of the shop being robbed. Weren\u2019t betting shops targeted all the time? \u201cThey just want the money,\u201d Miss X was told. \u201cHand the money over and everything will be fine.\u201d She got the job. 6. The rise of the machines Keen to turn up new markets, bookmakers not long ago started offering odds on the chancellor\u2019s spring Budget. What colour would George Osborne\u2019s tie be? How many times would the phrase \u201cLabour\u2019s economic mess\u201d be used? Really, though, nobody in the betting world can look forward to the spring, when chancellors generally shake down this industry with indecent rigour. Betting firms have for some years paid an unusually high rate of tax \u2013 more than \u00a31bn annually. Between 2011 and 2015 the operating profit before tax of Ladbrokes\u2019 retail arm fell from \u00a3152.3m to \u00a3116.1m, and its tax obligations in that period only went up. When Osborne\u2019s 2014 Budget raised the duty on takings from FOBTs from 20 to 25%, it was reckoned to cost the industry something like an extra \u00a370m a year. At the time, a Ladbrokes spokesperson complained: \u201cThe pips are squeaking.\u201d And yet, these hundreds of branches of Ladbrokes, all those William Hills and Paddy Powers and Betfreds \u2013 they were everywhere, around Birmingham\u2019s Bullring, up and down Aberdeen\u2019s Union Street, Cardiff-wide, packed into London\u2019s boroughs. In a decade when the high street has come out strongly in favour of thrift and convenience, betting shops have clung on as an unlikely modern super-presence. Of course, they are not much use to the thrifty. But they\u2019re not especially convenient either \u2013 placing a bet is a transaction far more easily accomplished invisibly, online, than in a material shop, where you\u2019ll likely trample in over a carpeting of abandoned bet slips (these boxy, overbright spaces always tend to look as if a major parade has just passed through) and in that climate of tension and boredom, biro out a prediction longhand. Win, and you\u2019ll have to go back. If you mislay your little receipt, write it off. They would once have been as densely packed as pubs, stopped at with the religious regularity of churches, taut with etiquette, like a public library \u2013 but walk into one of Britain\u2019s 9,000 betting shops in 2016 and you will rarely find it full or even busy. Who are all the shops for? Usually men. Their expressions often sullen. There\u2019s a William Hill in Hull in which, by unspoken agreement, Turks stick to one side of the shop and Kurds to the other. In one Ladbrokes in Sheffield, the white, Asian, eastern European and Somali customers mix well. Privately, informally, staff divide the modern class of betting-shop punter into two broad groups: the Older Gentlemen (in for the horses) and the Machine Gamblers. At Andrew Iacovou\u2019s branch in Morden, there was an elderly regular from the West Indies, known to the others as Rocky, who didn\u2019t gamble on either horses or the machines. He just seemed to want a place to be, and often cleaned up the discarded betting slips to help out. Bookmakers buy lots of television advertising time to promote gambling through their websites and mobile-phone apps, while their vast estates of retail outlets go just about unmentioned. Betting shops can seem marginal places today, even through the eyes of those who run them. Yet as pubs vanish, churches vanish, libraries vanish, the marginalised have not vanished. Walking around near Morden tube, three years after Iacovou\u2019s murder, I wondered if I would be able to find any of his former customers. I soon realised that I only had to speak to men on the street \u2013 those who looked to be of retirement age and who looked to be doing nothing in particular. They all knew Iacovou\u2019s Ladbrokes. They had dispersed, since his death, to the Paddy Power a few hundred metres away, to the Stan James across the road, to the Ladbrokes on Tudor Drive, to the William Hill further along the A24. Who are all these shops for? Better to ask what they\u2019re for. When the Labour government in 2005 made law a maximum of four FOBTs per betting shop, it had meant to limit peoples\u2019 exposure to the machines. Four ought to be enough. But a betting firm such as Ladbrokes will retain only about \u00a32 from every \u00a3100 spent on its FOBTs. The machines are profitable only on a high-volume/low-margin basis; that is to say, after factoring spend on staffing, real estate, and renting the machines (most of which are owned by third-party companies), there\u2019s no money in them unless they\u2019re played widely and played often. An unintended effect of the 2005 Gambling Act may have been to encourage bookmakers to open more shops, and to move existing shops from the back streets to more visible parts of cities and towns. Locals in Great Yarmouth recently campaigned to stop a ninth betting shop opening in the town centre. Last year, residents of Thornton Heath tried to resist a 14th betting shop opening within a single postal district. In 2010, on Birmingham\u2019s Stephenson Street, a Ladbrokes opened next door to a Ladbrokes. There are 26 branches of William Hill in greater Hull, and when I asked why, a spokesman explained it was \u201cto cater to local demand\u201d. (The Association of British Bookmakers, or ABB, the industry body that represents the major chains, said that the overall number of betting shops has actually decreased in recent years, and added: \u201cOver 60% of existing betting shops have been trading from the same location for over 20 years.\u201d) After 2005, bookmakers began to open their shops earlier in the morning and later at night. According to the ABB, this was to broadcast and take bets on evening sporting events. But senior industry employees told me that it was to create extra hours of machine use \u2013 a feeling shared on shop floors. \u201cFour walls around the FOBTs,\u201d was how one manager described her branch. \u201cWe\u2019re chaperones for the machines these days,\u201d said another manager, \u201ceveryone knows that.\u201d 7. The Ladbrokes experience When I questioned the ABB about single-manning and other working conditions in betting shops, a spokesman pointed out that those who work in petrol stations and newsagents often do so alone. Other industry sources said that lorry drivers and taxi drivers worked solo, too. The comparisons were not unfair, but they did not take full account of the nature of betting shops, or their peculiar presence. Known to be everywhere, known to have cash. As likely as not staffed by a woman, more likely than not staffed alone. They were often near pubs, nightclubs, takeaways, cab ranks. They stayed open late. Ever since the extension of opening hours, branch workers told me, they had been more likely to have to deal with customers who were drunk or on drugs. They also told me about the other sort of difficult customer: the non-customer, bewildered, unstable, otherwise desperate, drifting in because they could not reliably expect to idle anywhere else during unsociable hours without being ushered on. An employee of Ladbrokes in Birmingham, Harry Vale, was taken aback in 2013 to be asked by his area manager to start buying food and drink for people who came into his shop. Not just complimentary cups of tea but full meals, from McDonald\u2019s or Greggs. \u201cWe had a ringbinder with their favourites written down,\u201d Vale said, adding that the free food initiative, dreamed up in 2013 and introduced in multiple branches around the Midlands, did not seem to him the wisest arrangement when it came to the issue of vulnerable or unstable people hanging around in betting shops. But, then, Vale was pretty new to the business at the time, and a great many industry conventions can seem baffling to the uninitiated. For instance, there is \u201cbanking\u201d, an industry-wide practice by which betting-shop staff are asked to take excess cash out of their safes and then travel, often with thousands of pounds hidden about their person, to deposit it at the nearest bank or Post Office. (\u201cWe\u2019re only supposed to take \u00a35,000 at a time,\u201d said a branch worker in Oxfordshire, adding that she had once taken as much as \u00a39,000 on a single trip, distributing it about herself in different pockets.) And then there was \u201cthe Ladbrokes Experience\u201d, a company initiative launched in 2013, not long after the Morden murder, that would have Ladbrokes staff come out from behind their locked counters and interact with customers. \u201cWe had to go to our teams and brief this,\u201d recalled the area manager in the north, \u201cafter Andrew Iacovou. That they had to be on the shop floor at all times. That the only time they were allowed to stay behind the counter was if they felt they had a very specific threat.\u201d Mia Whitaker, 21 that year, was working in a Ladbrokes in the Moor area of Sheffield. She had good reason to want to stay behind her counter, her own Ladbrokes experience having been made horrible by two regulars, young taxi drivers, who came in to play the FOBTs or to watch sport. When Whitaker passed them on the shop floor, she recalled, \u201cthey would try to touch my bum and my chest\u201d. They offered taunting comments and gestures, coming in at night and when she was alone in the branch. Whitaker complained to her line manager, and later to Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office. (Ladbrokes told the Guardian: \u201cIf an employee raises concerns, we would investigate and where necessary take action.\u201d) The security office sent a trespass order to Whitaker\u2019s shop, meant for the two men, but when it arrived by post Whitaker said none of her colleagues would present it. Her manager suggested instead that he have a quiet word with the drivers \u2013 they were regular customers. Whitaker didn\u2019t have the nerve to present the trespass order herself. The taxi drivers knew what her hours were, and where her bus stop was. So for more than a year after that, until Whitaker left the job, the men kept coming into their local betting shop, where they could expect to play the machines, or to watch the evening darts, and to harass the 21-year-old who was nominally in charge. Looking back on this later, after a season of contained and uncontained chaos in the betting shops, Whitaker would have reason to be relieved that things only went so far. 8. The wild west One weekend, the manager of a Ladbrokes in Scotland was robbed by two men while she was alone in her branch. She later described the experience. \u201cOne had a hammer,\u201d she said. \u201cOne had a screwdriver. One of them pinned me in a corner with a hammer above my head, while the other one emptied the till. To me it felt like hours. I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not getting home from here.\u2019 I thought of the man in London. I thought: \u2018They\u2019re taking me out in a box today.\u2019 I thought: \u2018I\u2019m never going home.\u2019\u201d In June 2013, a month after Andrew Iacovou\u2019s killing, a Ladbrokes in Cardiff was robbed by two men, one carrying what police described as \u201ca small axe\u201d. In July, a Ladbrokes in Newcastle was robbed by a man with a seven-inch vegetable knife. In August, a Coral employee in Ewell, Surrey, was robbed in their branch by two men, claiming to be armed. In September, thieves threatened to \u201cchop up\u201d a Coral employee in his branch in Gorton, Manchester. They stole money and a plug-in telephone. Branch workers around the country described to me a feeling during this period that they were being kept out on the shop floor as a hindrance, but no real impediment, to incident; on display like scarecrows, and about as formidable a deterrent. \u201cPleasure doing business with you,\u201d a thief who robbed a William Hill in Whitstable in 2013 told staff on his way out. A member of a gang that robbed a Ladbrokes in Darlington in September that year returned to the same shop, the same day, to claim the \u00a3134 he had won on a FOBT while casing the joint. The same month, a man robbed a Ladbrokes in Welwyn Garden City by walking in with a bottle wrapped in wires and tape and telling the woman staffing the shop it was a bomb. She hid behind a door while the thief put the package on the counter and left with \u00a3500. After the bomb squad had been and gone, and the thief traced and arrested, it transpired he was out on licence for another robbery, of another Ladbrokes, with another lone-working employee, in 2010. \u201cIt had become like the wild west,\u201d said a senior figure inside Ladbrokes at the time. \u201cRobberies with shotguns. Staff and customers getting beaten up. People getting hospitalised. We were getting staff coming back to work [after incidents] with PTSD. They were shell-shocked.\u201d The Morden killing had already confirmed in this employee the opinion that nobody was realistically safe to work alone in betting shops. \u201cBut I was not allowed that view. I said [to my superiors]: \u2018This is not good.\u2019 I said: \u2018This is wrong.\u2019 But I was not allowed that view. So you make your noises and you get on with your job.\u201d Others made noises. A petition, launched online, \u201cto make it compulsory for high-street bookmakers to have two members of staff present during opening hours\u201d, gathered 3,824 signatures by November 2013. Nothing changed, and people got on with their jobs. In February 2014, the Labour MP for Islwyn, Chris Evans, raised the matter in a Westminster debate. Evans had once been a low-level betting shop employee himself. He proposed that the government might consider legislation to insist that staff in shops be equipped with panic alarms, so that they could at least call for help if they got into trouble. The Tory MP for Shipley, Philip Davies, responded first, voicing concerns about \u201cputting too much obligation on betting shops\u201d. (Davies has more than once been accused by newspapers of receiving personal benefits from links to the gambling industry \u2013 allegations he has denied.) Davies said that \u201cwe could end up, not with single-manned betting shops, but with no betting shops, and nobody in work\u201d. Evans said: \u201cAll I am looking for is simple, common-sense, cheap things \u2026 \u201d The debate puttered out. March 2014: a Stan James in Oxford, one armed robber saying to the other, of a lone-working employee made to kneel on the floor, \u201cShoot him. Shoot him.\u201d April 2014: a Paddy Power in Cheshunt, robbed by armed men in balaclavas on Grand National Saturday. July 2014: a Ladbrokes in Leyland, Lancashire, a female employee locked in the toilet while the shop was robbed of \u00a32,500. September 2014: a William Hill in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, a man carrying a piece of metal piping. October 2014: a Coral in Glasgow, a man carrying a piece of paper. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, just give me the money, I\u2019ve got a knife,\u201d Kenneth Duncan wrote on a betting slip that he handed to 20-year-old Amber Johnstone. \u201cI\u2019m 5ft 6in. I look my age,\u201d Johnstone told me. \u201cI think the guy noticed a young girl on her own in the shop and saw it as a perfect opportunity.\u201d Duncan made off with \u00a3375. Johnstone could not sleep for months afterwards, and eventually entered therapy. Spokespeople for the bookmakers were often careful to stress to the public, after such robberies, that not much money was kept in any one location. \u201cIt is never as much as people think,\u201d said a Coral spokesperson, after the 2013 robbery in Ewell. There were strict limits on the amount of cash kept in branches \u2013 not more than \u00a32,000 in a Ladbrokes, that figure varying slightly from chain to chain. Limits were strictly enforced \u2013 thus the compulsion for employees to pad themselves with cash mid-shift and scurry to the nearest bank \u2013 though branch workers questioned at times just what these limits were in place to protect. It must have been with limited relief, for instance, that bottom-rung staff at William Hill read in a recent brochure for shareholders that the company had managed to reduce the average amount of cash lost during robberies \u2013 down something like \u00a380 per raid on the year. 9. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m alive\u201d After years of proud defiance, in 2014 William Hill informed its staff that they would now be asked to work alone in their shops during the evening. A spokesman told me: \u201cAs the over-the-counter part of the business declined, and costs and taxes increased, it made sense to operate to the right level of staffing.\u201d A Hull-based deputy manager recalled: \u201cWe were told over fancy sandwiches in a hotel.\u201d William Hill described staff reaction as \u201cmixed\u201d. To the deputy manager and her colleagues, the move felt like a stunning reversal. The policy was rolled out across two-thirds of William Hill\u2019s shops. By October 2014, executives at the company felt warmly enough towards single-manning to defend it from possible regulation. In a consultation with the government\u2019s Gambling Commission about betting shop licence conditions, William Hill stated it would be \u201can undue and unjustifiable interference for regulators to dictate staffing levels\u201d in betting shops. The deputy manager of a William Hill in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, had not long before been released from hospital, his face unrecognisably bruised and his lung punctured after an attack by two machine gamblers who would not leave when he tried to close up his shop. He had been alone. \u201cThe blame for this criminal act should lay firmly with the perpetrators,\u201d a William Hill spokesman told me, adding: \u201cIt would be wrong to use this case to make a point on lone working generally.\u201d That spring, the Liberal Democrat MP for Carshalton and Wallington, Tom Brake, invited representatives from Ladbrokes to his Westminster office. One of Brake\u2019s constituents had raised concerns about the industry\u2019s response, or lack of it, to Iacovou\u2019s death. The trio of Ladbrokes reps huddled with Brake around a table at Portcullis House and explained a possible new safety initiative. Special software would be installed on betting shop computers, Brake was told, programmed to alert Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office if staff did not use their mouse or keyboard for 45 minutes. In the meeting the MP asked the representatives if they would consider more substantial measures, such as abandoning single-manning. Brake recalled being told no: \u201cThe finances didn\u2019t stack up.\u201d The mouse-movement initiative was \u201ca nonsense\u201d, a senior figure inside Ladbrokes at the time admitted. \u201cA lot of things can happen to someone in 45 minutes.\u201d (It was never implemented.) Multiple sources suggested that more tangible measures were being considered, such as portable panic alarms. As well as being equipped with a button to contact Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office, the alarms contained motion sensors. Lie flat for more than 15 seconds and an alarm would be triggered. In theory, no staff member wearing an alarm would suffer Iacovou\u2019s fate of prolonged non-discovery. Devices were distributed to about half the company\u2019s shops in 2014 and 2015, at first to the locations deemed most at risk of violent incident. Miss X\u2019s Ladbrokes, in the Leicester area, was not among those branches to get alarms. She was working the evening shift on Friday 5 June 2015. It was a quiet night. TVs in the shop broadcast foreign horse racing and a tennis match on clay at the French Open, but there were no customers in to gamble on it. Miss X whiled away the time behind the counter on her phone. At 8.58pm, a little more than an hour before closing, a regular she recognised called Vijay Singh came into the shop and started playing on the machines. He wore a black T-shirt and faded jeans, and had his dark hair spiked with gel. Singh played for about 25 minutes, gambling and losing around \u00a3400. At 9.24pm, he signalled to Miss X that there was something wrong with his machine. Miss X opened the locked door that secured her service area from the shop floor, and checked the machine. She found no fault. She returned behind her counter and picked up her phone. Minutes later, Singh again said there was a problem with his machine. This time, when Miss X emerged, he grabbed her by the wrists. Singh pushed her backwards through the service area and forced her into a bathroom at the rear of the building. Twenty minutes passed. At 9.49pm, Singh emerged from the rear of the shop with blood on his jeans. On his way towards the exit, he tried to open the till behind the counter, but could not. Instead he picked up a bag of loose coins and left. Another 20 minutes passed. Nobody was aware that there had been an attack in the branch until Miss X regained consciousness, at around 10.10pm, and dialled 999 herself. Hiding in the bathroom, she told the dispatch controller she had been beaten, throttled, threatened with murder and sexually assaulted. Her nose was broken and her neck was fractured. Waiting for officers to arrive, she said to the controller: \u201cI\u2019m so scared.\u201d She said: \u201cHe was on the machines. I think he lost a lot of money.\u201d She said: \u201cI\u2019m in so much pain \u2026 I\u2019m bleeding so much \u2026 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m alive.\u201d The controller asked if there was anybody else in the shop with her. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not.\u201d Half a second\u2019s pause. \u201cYou\u2019re just working there on your own, are you?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d 10. A judge\u2019s verdict It was the week leading up to another Grand National weekend, in April 2016, when I visited Anita Iacovou in Cheam. Her youngest son answered the door. Anita apologised for not being able to stand up; she was suffering from a medical condition that made mobility difficult. Beside her in her chair in the front room she had packets of boxed medicine, a pile of letters and a tabloid newspaper, turned to the runners and riders for the big race. Anita said she was still fond of betting shops, and that she had been down the road to the nearest one that morning. Reaching for the tabloid, she pointed out her pick for the Grand National: number eight, an outsider with odds of 40/1 called On His Own. The Morden Ladbrokes where her husband worked had not reopened since the day of his death. Sheets of pale plastic had been put up in the windows where the posters had once been. Anita knew what had happened in that other Ladbrokes in the Leicester area in the summer of 2015 \u2013 the Daily Mail had telephoned her afterwards to ask her opinion. She had followed developments in the Midlands since then, with pity and even some guilt. Anita recalled that, at her husband\u2019s funeral in July 2013, she had asked the priest to speak a few words about the fact of Andrew working alone when he died. Senior figures from Ladbrokes were in attendance that day. There was a definite thickening of the atmosphere, guests recalled, when the priest sermonised about the value of money against the value of a human life. The family expected something substantial would change afterwards, and when it didn\u2019t, and then the attack on Miss X happened, Anita said that Andrew\u2019s death had been denied its only possible positive outcome. As we spoke in her front room, Ladbrokes was about to stage its spring AGM. Without knowing it, Anita had been on a list of possible \u201cproblem attendees\u201d at these gatherings ever since 2013. According to a source, it had been feared that she would show up, asking awkward questions; but really Anita\u2019s fight was quieter than that. She only wanted to feel that her husband\u2019s death had meant something. William Hill continues to single-man its shops. A spokesman told me the company was \u201ccontinually monitoring\u201d the situation, but it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d they would all be dual-manned again. Betfred, Coral, Paddy Power and Stan James continue to single-man. Ladbrokes, in the weeks after the attack in the Leicester area, quietly suspended single-manning in surrounding shops, but it was soon reinstated. The company\u2019s CEO, Jim Mullen, decided last year that single-scheduling would become voluntary for staff working after 7pm. This opt-out policy would be extended gradually across the Ladbrokes\u2019 estate and extra staff hired, employees were told. They could expect it in every branch by January 2016. In January 2016, the date for completion was pushed back to October 2016. Scepticism had already set in behind counters about that word \u201cvoluntary\u201d. Some had already tried to opt out of single-manning, they told me, and had been pressured into reconsidering. \u201cThreatened with being relocated,\u201d a manager in north Wales reported. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice that doesn\u2019t really seem like a choice,\u201d said a manager in Edinburgh. (Ladbrokes said: \u201cWe would never tolerate victimisation of an employee for raising a concern of any nature.\u201d) Vijay Singh was arrested on 7 June 2015, two days after his attack on Miss X. He was in hiding at his brother-in-law\u2019s house, where bloody jeans were found stuffed in a cabinet. When Singh\u2019s brother-in-law was interviewed by police, he disclosed that the first thing Singh had said after coming out of Ladbrokes on the night of the attack was: \u201cI\u2019ve just killed somebody.\u201d Only later did Singh learn Miss X had survived the ordeal. When he was brought to trial at Stafford crown court in May 2016, charged with attempted murder, sexual assault by penetration, and theft, Miss X testified for the prosecution. The trial lasted just over two weeks \u2013 ample time for more incidents to occur. In Manchester, police pursued an eastern European man who had spent \u201cseveral hours\u201d playing a FOBT in a city-centre Ladbrokes, waiting for the manager to be left alone, before pulling a knife. In Ware, a pregnant Ladbrokes employee was robbed in her shop. Meanwhile, in Stafford, at the end of a draining trial, the jury in the case was sent out to deliberate. They were gone for hours. The court\u2019s public gallery emptied, and a representative from Ladbrokes, who for days had been transcribing the events of the trial on a laptop, went for his lunch. I walked to the nearest betting shop \u2013 a Ladbrokes on Stafford\u2019s main shopping parade, next to an off-licence and below a solicitor\u2019s office. At the back of the branch, behind the counter, a young employee read a newspaper. He had a chunky plastic panic alarm clipped awkwardly to the collar of his red polo shirt. On the shop floor, an old man waited for the two o\u2019clock at Kempton. By the door were the four FOBTs, one taken up by a middle-aged man playing a puzzle game called The Sky\u2019s The Limit, another taken by a thirtysomething playing roulette. The other machines were idle, their high-definition screens programmed to flash through routine announcements: ads for the games that might be played on them, and bald warnings about the risks of playing these games incautiously. One machine flashed a message, black-on-red, that told customers not to gamble when upset. The other said in capital letters: \u201cSTAY IN CONTROL.\u201d After five hours\u2019 deliberation, the jury returned with a verdict. Singh was guilty. Judge Michael Chambers, presiding, described the crimes as \u201chorrendous\u201d and said that Singh could expect \u201csubstantial imprisonment\u201d. Preparing to dismiss the jury, Chambers thanked them for their time and said that, as he was sure they would agree, one aspect of the case had been especially troubling. How, Chambers wondered aloud, could Ladbrokes ever have allowed a young woman to be working on her own that night? The judge called it \u201cforeseeable\u201d that someone like Singh would take advantage of such a situation. \u201cIn my view,\u201d Chambers said, \u201cLadbrokes\u2019 actions in this case can be viewed as extremely negligent.\u201d The judge then turned from the jury to look at the public gallery, where the Ladbrokes representative sat behind a laptop. \u201cI hope,\u201d the judge said, slowly and clearly, \u201cyou will record that.\u201d The representative typed. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "body": "<p>On its last full day of trading, the Ladbrokes betting shop in Morden, south-west London, stayed open until 10 at night. It was Friday 24 May 2013, the beginning of one of those spring-summer weekends for which the schedules of global sport combine to throw up a glut of events that can be gambled on. A European football final, a super-middleweight title fight, a Grand Prix, high-season horse races, a golf tournament. The manager of the Morden Ladbrokes, a 55-year-old Londoner named Andrew Iacovou, sat behind his shop\u2019s counter with a computer, a scroll printer, a coin tray and, beside his knees, a safe \u2013 waiting to take bets.</p> <p>A balding and naturally slight man who spent his free hours in the gym, Iacovou had worked for Ladbrokes for more than 20 years. Quiet but not unconfident and well liked by his regular customers, he was one of the company\u2019s 15,500 employees, around 11,000 of whom worked in Ladbrokes\u2019 2,200 shops. Iacovou had run a Ladbrokes in Wimbledon, a Ladbrokes in Earlsfield and another Ladbrokes in Morden before moving to his current branch, a glass-fronted shop next to a supermarket, just across the A24 from Morden tube. For more than two decades with the firm, he had seen through changes to the staff uniform (tomato-red polo shirts, now) as well as a series of dispiriting adjustments to his daily workload. In the 1990s, when Iacovou first met his wife, Anita, then a Post Office employee, he worked at the Wimbledon branch. It shut to customers at 5.30pm and Iacovou would close down the premises by 6pm, ready to walk Anita home.</p> <p>His Morden branch, in 2013, was open seven days a week, from 8.30am or 9am until 10pm. Iacovou generally worked five of those days, sometimes six, often from start to finish. For some hours in the afternoon he would be joined at the till by an assistant, a cashier who helped him process handwritten bets that came in over the counter. Otherwise, Iacovou manned the shop alone, relying on his regulars for company. They were mostly male, mostly retired, often on their way to or from the nearby Ganley\u2019s pub.</p> <p>There was a rosy-faced man in his 60s, called Michael, who sat at a shop kiosk and frowned at length over his spread-out betting slips, ruminating before committing to a day\u2019s wagers. There was a taxi driver, Alan the Taxi, who parked in the rank outside and came in to bet the occasional \u00a35 on football. A fellow cabbie, John the Taxi, didn\u2019t gamble, but he came in and out to use the loo. Both drivers brought with them takeaway coffees for Iacovou, who could not leave the shop unless his cashier was there. The branch had a regular named Ray, who bet horses, and Kistensamy, who bet horses, and Bill, who only bet dogs. There was a relative newcomer, Shafique Aarij, a man in his 20s with pocked skin who had drawn attention to himself by combing his hair, nervously, whenever he played on one of the shop\u2019s electronic gambling machines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2017/jan/06/the-big-gamble-the-dangerous-world-of-british-betting-shops-podcast\">The big gamble: the dangerous world of British betting shops \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That Friday, Aarij complained to the manager about a problem with one of these machines. Iacovou had to come out from behind his counter to see what was wrong. It was one of dozens of menial but mounting tasks he had to see to: filling the coupon trays; scissoring out form guides from the Racing Post and arranging them on magnetic display boards; alternating posters in the street-facing windows; managing customers who approached his till holding winning slips (and those who came anyway, as losers, to moan); monitoring the amount of money in the coin tray, in the till, and in the safe; monitoring the door, in case someone too young or too unsavoury-looking should try to enter; monitoring the shop\u2019s four gambling machines, in case any of them should break down, the colours on the simulated casino games turn funny or the calibration on the touchscreens slip out of sync. At the end of the day these machines had to be laboriously emptied of takings and the shop otherwise shut down. Though Iacovou\u2019s branch closed to customers at 10, that night he did not get back to his home in Cheam until midnight. He was exhausted, his wife recalled, and he slept in his uniform.</p> <p>In the morning, Iacovou took the bus back to the Morden branch, arriving at around 8am, in time to meet a colleague from another Ladbrokes who had come to collect a set of spare keys. The pair chatted briefly. There had been a time when they might have been rostered to spend Saturday together in the shop, but no longer. Iacovou was not expecting his cashier to arrive until after lunch. The managers said goodbye to each other and Iacovou began to prepare for trade, turning on the machines and checking that each of their coin and note slots were functioning properly. He put up pages from the Racing Post and took out cleaning products to tidy his counter area. The posters in the street-facing window that morning said \u201cWin\u201d, \u201cFREE BET\u201d, \u201cGuaranteed\u201d, \u201cDebit cards accepted\u201d. Iacovou opened a locked door that separated the shop floor from his service area and sat down at his till. As it turned 8.30am, he pressed a button to unseal the shop\u2019s magnetically locked front door, and was open for business.</p> <p>The first customer was Shafique Aarij. That morning he was carrying a shoulder bag. He went to one of the gambling machines. As had happened the day before, Aarij signalled to Iacovou that there was a problem with his machine. The manager stood up and started to unlock the door beside his counter. As soon as the latch was turned, Aarij pushed in. He grabbed Iacovou around the neck. The two men struggled. Aarij took a claw hammer from his bag and struck Iacovou over the head with it. He struck again, and again, and then he turned his attention to the safe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/13/the-death-and-life-of-a-great-british-pub\">The death and life of the great British pub | Tom Lamont</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2. A part of British life</h2> <p><strong>It is a rare British high street </strong>that has not come to be kitted out, today, in the colours of the bookmakers. In every town, on every retail row, the routine sweep of bank and salon and shrunken supermarket will be studded at almost mathematical intervals by the red of a Ladbrokes storefront or the blue and yellow of a William Hill, likely as well by the blue of a Coral, the blue and red of a Betfred, the pale green of a Stan James or the clover-leaf shade of a Paddy Power. In total, there are around 9,000 licensed betting shops in the UK, around half of those operated by Ladbrokes and William Hill. The two corporations are great and bitter rivals, tracing a contempt for one another back to the 1930s. Difficult as it is to credit now, both companies once shared a snotty attitude about the idea of bookmakers having <em>shops</em>.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be very nice,\u201d said Mr William Hill, founder of William Hill, in 1956, \u201cto see at every street corner a betting shop.\u201d There was never a Mr Ladbrokes; the company was named for a country house where its founders trained horses in the 1880s. Up to the 1960s it reckoned itself too posh for street-level trade. Bookmakers at the time operated under licence only at racetracks, or took bets from private customers by post or telephone. Profits made in this way were undermined by a thriving black market in illegal street betting. Before the tonnes of lurid acrylic got hoisted into place on shop fronts nationwide, British bookmaking had as its most visible identifier a lone man or boy, waiting with a satchel of money on any street corner that had a choice of escape routes.</p> <p>Betting shops were legalised in 1961. A year later, the Times audited the country, describing the first bookmakers\u2019 shops, and reporting on the genteel (a \u201cclean, sky-blue parlour\u201d) as well as the already run-down (a \u201cseedy, litter-strewn room containing listless youths sucking pencils\u201d). All had windows that were blacked out, at government insistence, to discourage loitering. An employee known as a \u201cmarker\u201d would stand by a blackboard, close to a telephone or later a loudspeaker that broadcast racing commentary, chalking up results. Another employee, called a \u201csettler\u201d, calculated odds in their head. Cashiers took in money and sometimes gave it out. Customers could not drink in betting shops, but they could smoke. These were bolt-holes, very often in the backstreets, stuffy but social, somewhere to be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"14de28ee7ea067fa8a11bd1b0e10ce1b9bd707a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14de28ee7ea067fa8a11bd1b0e10ce1b9bd707a0/0_46_3008_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Machines in betting shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Fixed-odds betting terminals, or FOBTs, offer a digitised version of roulette as well as arcade-style games.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Segre/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And they were popular, particularly with working-class men. Once Ladbrokes and William Hill could not ignore the potential profits any longer, they began to open branches, or take over existing ones, and from the mid-1960s on, the two companies\u2019 spread was rapid and aggressive. Between them they absorbed dozens of smaller now-forgotten firms \u2013 Solomons &amp; Flanagan, JJ Simonds, Ken Munden, Fred Parkinson.</p> <p>William Hill had 100 shops by 1970, and Ladbrokes more than 400. \u201cThey are part of British life now,\u201d said Hill not long before he died. His company was bought by Sears Holdings Limited in 1971, and then traded on again through a number of conglomerates. Both William Hill and Ladbrokes became PLCs, floated on the stock market. They had 1,000 shops each, then 2,000. Wooden writing benches, pencilled over with decades\u2019 worth of redundant figuring, were removed from branches and replaced by plasticky kiosks. Instead of pencils came that icon of the modern betting shop, the complimentary pen: stubby, flat edged, much-chucked in frustration, apparently of limitless supply.</p> <p>Regulation changes in the 1980s allowed TVs to be installed in shops, bringing in races and results direct from horse and greyhound tracks. (That killed the role of the fast-chalking \u201cmarkers\u201d.) Cashiers, in the 1990s, got networked computers. (Thus the \u201csettlers\u201d also became redundant.) Plinky, pound-at-a-time fruit machines came in and then, around the turn of the millennium, the first modern gambling machines \u2013 \u201cfixed-odds betting terminals\u201d, or FOBTs (pronounced fobtees), offering a digitised version of roulette as well as other arcade-style games that could be gambled on. The major bookmakers also launched and invested in dotcom operations, but they were not especially light-footed about it, and their profits were eaten into by an online-only service named Betfair that empowered its customers to act as bookies themselves, setting odds and taking bets from one another. Takings fell.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like characters in a sci-fi\u00a0film, veteran betting shop staff\u00a0now\u00a0speak of a happier time \u2013 \u2018before the machines\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At around the same time, betting on the industry\u2019s totemic sports, horse racing and greyhound racing, dropped away. Staff observed that a younger generation of gambler had come to see track racing as jargon-heavy, too favourable to those with specialist knowledge \u2013 dad\u2019s fancy \u2013 and they preferred to bet on football instead. Broadly speaking, there was less profit for bookmakers there: in football, unlike in a 15- or 30-rider horse race, only one side could fail to win. Takings fell further. A new piece of legislation, the 2005 Gambling Act, had enforced a limit of four FOBTs per betting shop. The money fed into these four machines became ever more important to each shop\u2019s viability.</p> <p>Like characters in a certain type of sci-fi film, veteran staff now speak of a happier time \u2013 \u201cbefore the machines\u201d. FOBTs, when they came, were accepting of much larger sums than the fruit machines that preceded them. Up to \u00a3100 could be fed in and gambled every 20 seconds, an amount later curbed, under changing government regulations, to \u00a350 every 20 seconds. Losers lost faster, and losing became an identifiably scratchier thing. Staff explained: the customer who backed a too-slow horse or a crap dog might afterwards rail at fate or the gods, or even the employees behind their counters. But they could not plausibly claim to have been cheated. Machine players brought with them a new paranoia. FOBTs are fixed, thus the name \u2013 fixed-odds betting terminals. Over time they will pay back to customers 97.4% of the money that is put into them. Even so, it became a common thing for staff to be accused of rigging equipment, of dialling up losing streaks, of modulating people\u2019s electronic luck.</p> <p>Many shop workers I spoke to had stories about looking on, impotent, as the machines under their charge were angrily destroyed by the customers who had been playing them. Worse, somehow, was when a machine was <em>calmly</em> destroyed. The deputy manager of a William Hill in Hull said: \u201cYou just watch, there\u2019s nothing else to do. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s normal for people to smash up the shop.\u201d (A representative of William Hill said this was \u201crare\u201d.) A woman working at an Oxfordshire Ladbrokes told me she had watched all four FOBTs in her shop get wrecked by a man swinging a stool; by the next day\u2019s trade, she said, her ruined machines had all been replaced. According to figures I have seen, the number of incidents of damage to machines in Ladbrokes branches rose steadily between 2010 and 2015.</p> <p>A senior figure at Ladbrokes during this period became increasingly concerned by the situation at shop-level \u201cgetting silly, getting crazy\u201d. They told me it was their belief that with the introduction of the machines, betting shops had more or less become \u201cmini casinos\u201d. And how many casinos, they asked, got by without bouncers to cope with aggrieved gamblers? How many were run by individuals on their own?</p> <h2>3. Work alone, or don\u2019t work</h2> <p><strong>Even after the markers</strong> were made redundant by TV, and the settlers run off by desktop computers, it was rare for employees to work in their betting shops alone; until it wasn\u2019t. While staff at William Hill were told by company bosses, often and emphatically, that they would not be asked to man branches by themselves at night, Ladbrokes began to draw up what it called a \u201csingle-scheduling\u201d policy in 2010. The policy meant that, subject to certain conditions, including a risk assessment of individual branches and a tick-box check of employee competence, shops could be run by one person for periods of the day and night. In fact, in the majority of shops, there would be a mandatory number of hours during which there could only be one person rostered to work.</p> <p>Single-manning, as staff started to call it, was trialled and then expanded around Ladbrokes\u2019 betting shops between 2011 and 2013. People at all levels of the company told me they were in no doubt as to why it was introduced. \u201cIt was a cost-cutting exercise,\u201d said an area manager who was then in charge of 15 branches in the south-east. A senior person in Ladbrokes\u2019 retail department at the time told me: \u201cThey recognised there were considerable savings to be made. Why double-man a shop between 10am and 1pm, or after 6pm, when it\u2019s quiet?\u201d</p> <p>Another well-placed source inside Ladbrokes at the time said they believed that by reducing staff from two to one in more than 2,000 shops, the company saved approximately \u00a315m a year. <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ladbrokes-staff-raped-killed-firm-7994485\">The Mirror reported</a> that between 2009 and 2011, Ladbrokes\u2019 annual wage bill dropped by a third. (Ladbrokes said this was a result of cuts in staffing at all levels, not specifically on shop floors.)</p> <p>At shop level, a choice: work on your own, or risk your job. An area manager who worked in the north and oversaw the running of more than 60 branches told the 200-odd employees under his charge: \u201cWe can either close this amount of shops and make this amount of people redundant, or we can single-man.\u201d The area manager remembered \u201ca lot of emotion. A lot of staff felt it wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d (Ladbrokes acknowledged that \u201csome of our employees have strong opinions on working alone\u201d and said it encouraged feedback.)</p> <p>Though most shops would still be able to budget for a second employee \u2013 a cashier on minimum wage \u2013 during the busier afternoon horse-racing hours, most Ladbrokes\u2019 shop staff could now expect to work alone before midday and after 6pm. At first, those who agreed to single-man were paid extra \u2013 something like an additional 40p an hour. (The hourly pay for branch managers, who are known internally at Ladbrokes as customer service managers, varies by area and age. In 2016, for a 23-year-old in the Wirral, it is \u00a38.51 per hour.) A source inside Ladbrokes\u2019 head office at the time pointed out that the additional money was soon stopped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ae6190189c46d36a69cc2735131c4d807bb5db0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ae6190189c46d36a69cc2735131c4d807bb5db0/0_62_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Betting shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Employees said they feared the sack if they complained in public forums about their working conditions.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Internal Ladbrokes sources spoke candidly to me on the condition that I not use their names. So did most of the dozens of betting shop workers I consulted for this story. Entering branches around the UK, and introducing myself as a reporter, I became used to a singular response: behind the counter their eyes would flick, instinctively, to the nearest CCTV camera.</p> <p>Employees said they feared the sack if they complained in public forums about their working conditions. A Ladbrokes branch manager in Wales said that, when she posted a comment on Facebook in reference to the attack on Andrew Iacovou in Morden, she was contacted within 20 minutes by the firm\u2019s London office and told to delete it or she would enter a disciplinary process. A Ladbrokes employee in Birmingham reported the same. Many of the part-time-working students and other junior staff I interviewed insisted they did not expect to be in their jobs for ever, that a pervasive industry gloom would soon flush them out \u2013 but that they needed good references, so could their names be left out of my story? I met working parents, working parents-to-be, second-generation staff who worked in branches <em>with</em> their parents, and other employees who could not risk dismissal, so asked to speak anonymously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One area manager recalled his shame at telling staff unnerved by\u00a0working alone that they were really\u00a0in no extra danger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But they spoke. The area manager in the north recalled his shame at telling staff who were unnerved by single-manning in its early phase that they were really in no extra danger. Back then, said the area manager, \u201cI supported the company line, telling my staff: \u2018We <em>need</em> to do this.\u2019\u201d He told any staff who felt unsafe working alone that \u201cif there <em>is</em> a robbery, as long as you hand over all the money, it\u2019s unlikely the robbers will do anything to you. You\u2019re probably at no more risk of a robbery on your own than you are with two people.\u201d A senior figure at Ladbrokes told me that, from the introduction of single-manning in 2010 until the end of 2014, the company kept no figures recording whether a branch was single- or double-manned at the time of a criminal incident.</p> <p>For a time, said the area manager in the north, single-manning \u201cseemed pretty innocuous\u201d. Persuading his staff became easier when other major betting chains started to single-man. Employees at Betfred, Stan James, Coral and Paddy Power told me they were all asked to work in their shops alone on a frequent basis. \u201cFor a while it did work fine,\u201d said the area manager. \u201cAnd then Andrew Iacovou happened.\u201d</p> <h2>4. The Morden branch</h2> <p><strong>Andrew and Anita Iacovou first met</strong> inside a Ladbrokes. It was a Saturday in April 1995, Grand National weekend. Anita had put an each-way bet on a horse called Party Politics. \u201cIntuition,\u201d she said. When her horse finished second, she took her ticket to Iacovou, who was working behind the counter. They started talking. Iacovou was 37 and had grown up not far away, in South Norwood. His father was Greek and his mother English. Anita was 34, second-generation Indian, with dark hair that she tied back in a knot. Iacovou must have been distracted, chatting, because he shorted Anita on her winnings. When she went back to check \u2013 \u00a333, wasn\u2019t it? \u2013 Iacovou asked her out. They married in 1999 and later had two sons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"21eec2d22c55096c45bac56bc02bae2f0365c501\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21eec2d22c55096c45bac56bc02bae2f0365c501/0_10_772_965/400.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Iacovou\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In 2010, Andrew Iacovou was moved to the branch near Morden tube.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Metropolitan Police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2005, the family moved to a flat in Cheam. For five years, until 2010, Iacovou worked at a Ladbrokes a walk away, on Tudor Drive. Then he was moved to the branch near Morden tube. \u201cHe told me he didn\u2019t feel safe there,\u201d Anita recalled. Twice, during Iacovou\u2019s evening shifts, the windows of his branch were broken by vandals. Anita\u2019s brother, Anil Punjabi, sometimes drove Anita and her sons to pick him up after work. But after a while, Punjabi recalled, Iacovou asked him not to bring the family on these trips, fearing they would be vulnerable in the car outside.</p> <p>The sensation of safety is not a hard currency; it cannot be passed around in token form. The Morden Ladbrokes had CCTV cameras inside it, a steel-framed front door with a magnetic lock, a latch-lock on the door between the shop floor and the service area, and an employee panic button under the counter. As dozens of shop employees pointed out to me, however, it is still possible to feel unsafe in the middle of a fortress like this, particularly at night, particularly when unaccompanied.</p> <p>The deputy manager of a Betfred in Sussex was working on her own when one night she was threatened with rape by a frustrated machine gambler. \u201cHe told me: \u2018You\u2019d like it.\u2019 I remember thinking: \u2018There\u2019s nowhere I can run.\u2019\u201d The Betfred deputy rang the police that night, and again the following night, and again the night after that, because the same man kept returning to the shop as soon as her assistant cashier left for the evening. For a while she took anti-anxiety medication, she said, to be able to keep working, and then she resigned. A female Ladbrokes worker in Oxfordshire recalled being told by a customer: \u201cI\u2019m going to come back at 10 o\u2019clock, when you close, and <em>take you</em>.\u201d She was 19. Employees, particularly women \u2013 of whom the betting-shop industry has an unusually high number, around 50% in branches \u2013 told me they had often asked husbands or friends to sit in shops with them on evenings they were rostered to work alone.</p> <p>Certain branches in certain areas were from the start deemed too dangerous to be single-manned. The neighbourhood around Andrew Iacovou\u2019s Morden shop was not judged by Ladbrokes\u2019 risk-assessment team to present any special danger. Part of the way Ladbrokes decided this was by considering unpleasant incidents that had already taken place inside a shop. It rated such incidents by degree. Verbal abuse from a customer was a \u201clevel one\u201d; physical abuse a \u201clevel two\u201d; physical abuse that resulted in hospitalisation a \u201clevel three\u201d. Suffer enough twos or threes and head office would take a shop off the single-manning list, at least for a short while. Andrew Iacovou\u2019s Morden branch had not had enough level twos or level threes.</p> <p>Anita worried for her husband. You did not have to search especially hard for stories about violence in British betting shops at the time. A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GtrManchesterPolice/posts/479406142129410\">machete robbery at a Betfred in Ashton-in-Makerfield in March 2013</a>. A man who had entered a Ladbrokes in Southampton in April 2013, and <a href=\"http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/10736140.Betting_shop_cashier_risked_life_to_tackle_knifepoint_robber/?ref=rss\">leapt over the counter with a kitchen knife</a>. Between them, the Iacovous had an arrangement: Andrew would call Anita from his shop, usually at about 8.30am, when he would have settled in, and then again at intervals through the day. On Saturday 25 May, Anita did not receive the expected call. She rang the shop and got no answer. She continued to call.</p> <p>Trying to work out what had happened later, police investigators rewatched CCTV footage recorded in the shop. They saw Shafique Aarij struggle with Iacovou behind the counter. This was at 8.33am. They saw Aarij hit Iacovou with a hammer, multiple times. Blood spotted his face, and he wiped at it. Within minutes of the attack Aarij had left the shop. Examining the shop\u2019s safe, police saw that its handle had received a hammer blow, but had remained locked. They knew from shop records that \u00a3296.86 had disappeared from the till. Aarij must have taken this when he fled, at around 8.35am.</p> <p>8.45am. 9am. 9.15am. For between 45 minutes and an hour, nobody outside the Morden branch was aware that anything unusual had happened inside. Andrew Iacovou lay in such a way behind his counter that he could not be seen from the shop floor. Customers came and went. Someone played on one of the machines. Eventually Kistensamy, one of the regulars, approached the counter and saw a body. He ran to the supermarket next door and raised the alarm. An ambulance came. Iacovou was pronounced dead by paramedics at 10.28am.</p> <h2>5. \u201cA tough year\u201d</h2> <p><strong>From branch to branch, rumours</strong> of a murder spread. Staff at a William Hill in Glasgow heard that an employee had been stabbed. At a Coral in Hemel Hempstead it was said that someone had been shot. In a Facebook group for industry professionals (the group is called \u201cI No Longer Fear Hell, I\u2019ve Worked in a Betting Shop\u201d and has over 14,000 members) Iacovou was discussed within hours of his death. \u201cWhat happened? Robbery gone wrong? Was he single-manning?\u201d The suggestion that Iacovou had lain undiscovered for so long was especially distressing to people. This was one of their great fears.</p> <p>In the Facebook group, a discussion about possible strike action led nowhere. A hopeless, gravedigger humour set in instead. \u201cIf you\u2019re single-manning and something happens,\u201d someone asked, \u201cwho will call for help?\u201d Someone replied: \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d Members discussed the wild inconsistency with which glass security screens were installed in shops, many premises going without (\u201cShow me one bank that doesn\u2019t have them for cash transactions\u201d). They compared notes about how easily a magnetically sealed front door could be forced by a determined intruder (\u201cI weigh 11 stone and \u2026 \u201d). They remembered the old days (\u201cI started in \u201994 \u2026 home by 5.30pm in the winter\u201d) and exchanged grim warnings about the future (\u201cNext time it could be any one of you\u201d). One especially distressing rumour about Iacovou spread between them: that before he died, the manager had been able to press the panic alarm beneath his counter, and that this alarm, while it had registered at Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office, had somehow gone unanswered.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was assumed that Aarij was a cleaner who must have pressed the panic button by mistake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was told by well-placed sources that this rumour was accurate. When the alarm registered at Ladbrokes\u2019 security office, a live CCTV feed from the shop was checked by a control room operator; but the operator saw only Aarij, not Iacovou. The operator also saw the cleaning materials that Iacovou had put out on his service area. It was assumed that Aarij was a cleaner who must have pressed the panic button by mistake. (A Ladbrokes spokesperson said that after this killing, \u201cchanges were made with regard to how our security control room responds to incidents\u201d.)</p> <p>In Cheam, Anita Iacovou heard nothing all morning. At 2pm, police visited her at the flat. Ladbrokes\u2019 security chief came too, as did a second Ladbrokes\u2019 representative. Anita was asked to step in to her bedroom to speak with a policewoman. Anita said, instinctively: \u201cHe\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d The policewoman said no, Andrew was dead. Anita said, \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d and the policewoman said no. The two children were at home. Anita called them into the room to tell them what had happened. There is not a lot more she can recall of the afternoon. She knows she turned to the two Ladbrokes representatives, in the family living room, and asked: why was he ever left there alone?</p> <p>Aarij, 21, was found by police five days later, hiding at a friend\u2019s home in east London. When interviewed at Sutton police station, Aarij accepted that he had gone to the betting shop in Morden that morning to steal money. That he had armed himself with a hammer beforehand. That he knew there was likely to be only one person on duty. When police asked why he had killed Iacovou, Aarij told them: \u201cWhen the siren was ringing I got scared and I became upset and then I was not in my senses.\u201d Police charged Aarij with murder. At trial in November 2013 he was found guilty. In January 2014 he was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum of 26 years.</p> <p>Ladbrokes paid a modest sum to Anita Iacovou and her family. (A well-placed source put it at \u00a3140,000.) Ladbrokes also launched a JustGiving page in Iacovou\u2019s memory, kicking off donations with \u00a310,000. The company paid for Iacovou\u2019s funeral, in July 2013. During Aarij\u2019s murder trial, Ladbrokes arranged for taxis to take Anita and her family to and from court. In its December report for shareholders, the company described 2013 as \u201ca tough year\u201d. Delicate mention was made of the murder. It was called \u201ca random violent attack\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"950ea2ca2a647fa16bcd81454b0cf31f633ab431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/950ea2ca2a647fa16bcd81454b0cf31f633ab431/0_0_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empty betting shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Shortly after Morden, an internal investigation found Ladbrokes\u2019 single-scheduling policy to be adequate.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Image Source</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The area manager in the north recalled: \u201cThe thinking was we sell it as a one-in-a-million anomaly that can never happen again.\u201d A senior figure at Ladbrokes at the time confirmed this. \u201cThose were conversations that were being had at senior level. It was taken as: \u2018The shell doesn\u2019t land in the same place twice.\u2019\u201d Another senior figure at Ladbrokes at the time said: \u201cThere was a naivety.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after Morden, an internal investigation was launched, and Ladbrokes\u2019 single-scheduling policy found to be adequate. When a new branch opened in the Leicester area that year, it was added, like hundreds of others, to the list of Ladbrokes that could be run by one person. In early 2014, a woman in her 20s was interviewed for a job at the branch. A court later imposed restrictions on the reporting of this woman\u2019s name \u2013 she would come to be known internally at the company as Miss X.</p> <p>During her interview, Miss X asked about the possibility of the shop being robbed. Weren\u2019t betting shops targeted all the time?</p> <p>\u201cThey just want the money,\u201d Miss X was told. \u201cHand the money over and everything will be fine.\u201d</p> <p>She got the job.</p> <h2>6. The rise of the machines</h2> <p><strong>Keen to turn up new markets,</strong> bookmakers not long ago started offering odds on the chancellor\u2019s spring Budget. What colour would George Osborne\u2019s tie be? How many times would the phrase \u201cLabour\u2019s economic mess\u201d be used? Really, though, nobody in the betting world can look forward to the spring, when chancellors generally shake down this industry with indecent rigour. Betting firms have for some years paid an unusually high rate of tax \u2013 more than \u00a31bn annually. Between 2011 and 2015 the operating profit before tax of Ladbrokes\u2019 retail arm fell from \u00a3152.3m to \u00a3116.1m, and its tax obligations in that period only went up. When Osborne\u2019s 2014 Budget raised the duty on takings from FOBTs from 20 to 25%, it was reckoned to cost the industry something like an extra \u00a370m a year. At the time, a Ladbrokes spokesperson complained: \u201cThe pips are squeaking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a402ed2348220a400228cdd6a5d1f8084fec103\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a402ed2348220a400228cdd6a5d1f8084fec103/0_113_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Betting shops in Hastings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018While the high street has come out strongly in favour of thrift and convenience, betting shops have clung on.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, these hundreds of branches of Ladbrokes, all those William Hills and Paddy Powers and Betfreds \u2013 they were everywhere, around Birmingham\u2019s Bullring, up and down Aberdeen\u2019s Union Street, Cardiff-wide, packed into London\u2019s boroughs. In a decade when the high street has come out strongly in favour of thrift and convenience, betting shops have clung on as an unlikely modern super-presence. Of course, they are not much use to the thrifty. But they\u2019re not especially convenient either \u2013 placing a bet is a transaction far more easily accomplished invisibly, online, than in a material shop, where you\u2019ll likely trample in over a carpeting of abandoned bet slips (these boxy, overbright spaces always tend to look as if a major parade has <em>just</em> passed through) and in that climate of tension and boredom, biro out a prediction longhand. Win, and you\u2019ll have to go back. If you mislay your little receipt, write it off.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Walk into one of Britain\u2019s 9,000 betting shops in 2016 and you will rarely find it full or even busy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They would once have been as densely packed as pubs, stopped at with the religious regularity of churches, taut with etiquette, like a public library \u2013 but walk into one of Britain\u2019s 9,000 betting shops in 2016 and you will rarely find it full or even busy. Who are all the shops for? Usually men. Their expressions often sullen. There\u2019s a William Hill in Hull in which, by unspoken agreement, Turks stick to one side of the shop and Kurds to the other. In one Ladbrokes in Sheffield, the white, Asian, eastern European and Somali customers mix well. Privately, informally, staff divide the modern class of betting-shop punter into two broad groups: the Older Gentlemen (in for the horses) and the Machine Gamblers. At Andrew Iacovou\u2019s branch in Morden, there was an elderly regular from the West Indies, known to the others as Rocky, who didn\u2019t gamble on either horses or the machines. He just seemed to want a place to be, and often cleaned up the discarded betting slips to help out.</p> <p>Bookmakers buy lots of television advertising time to promote gambling through their websites and mobile-phone apps, while their vast estates of retail outlets go just about unmentioned. Betting shops can seem marginal places today, even through the eyes of those who run them. Yet as pubs vanish, churches vanish, libraries vanish, the marginalised have not vanished.</p> <p>Walking around near Morden tube, three years after Iacovou\u2019s murder, I wondered if I would be able to find any of his former customers. I soon realised that I only had to speak to men on the street \u2013 those who looked to be of retirement age and who looked to be doing nothing in particular. They all knew Iacovou\u2019s Ladbrokes. They had dispersed, since his death, to the Paddy Power a few hundred metres away, to the Stan James across the road, to the Ladbrokes on Tudor Drive, to the William Hill further along the A24.</p> <p>Who are all these shops for? Better to ask what they\u2019re for. When the Labour government in 2005 made law a maximum of four FOBTs per betting shop, it had meant to limit peoples\u2019 exposure to the machines. Four ought to be enough. But a betting firm such as Ladbrokes will retain only about \u00a32 from every \u00a3100 spent on its FOBTs. The machines are profitable only on a high-volume/low-margin basis; that is to say, after factoring spend on staffing, real estate, and renting the machines (most of which are owned by third-party companies), there\u2019s no money in them unless they\u2019re played widely and played often.</p> <p>An unintended effect of the 2005 Gambling Act may have been to encourage bookmakers to open more shops, and to move existing shops from the back streets to more visible parts of cities and towns. <a href=\"http://www.greatyarmouthmercury.co.uk/news/william_hill_wins_appeal_to_open_second_betting_shop_in_great_yarmouth_1_3677735\">Locals in Great Yarmouth recently campaigned to stop a ninth betting shop opening in the town centre</a>. Last year, residents of Thornton Heath tried to resist a 14th betting shop opening within a single postal district. In 2010, on Birmingham\u2019s Stephenson Street, a Ladbrokes opened next door to a Ladbrokes. There are 26 branches of William Hill in greater Hull, and when I asked why, a spokesman explained it was \u201cto cater to local demand\u201d. (The Association of British Bookmakers, or ABB, the industry body that represents the major chains, said that the overall number of betting shops has actually decreased in recent years, and added: \u201cOver 60% of existing betting shops have been trading from the same location for over 20 years.\u201d)</p> <p>After 2005, bookmakers began to open their shops earlier in the morning and later at night. According to the ABB, this was to broadcast and take bets on evening sporting events. But senior industry employees told me that it was to create extra hours of machine use \u2013 a feeling shared on shop floors. \u201cFour walls around the FOBTs,\u201d was how one manager described her branch. \u201cWe\u2019re chaperones for the machines these days,\u201d said another manager, \u201ceveryone knows that.\u201d</p> <h2>7. The Ladbrokes experience</h2> <p><strong>When I questioned the ABB </strong>about single-manning and other working conditions in betting shops, a spokesman pointed out that those who work in petrol stations and newsagents often do so alone. Other industry sources said that lorry drivers and taxi drivers worked solo, too. The comparisons were not unfair, but they did not take full account of the nature of betting shops, or their peculiar presence. Known to be everywhere, known to have cash. As likely as not staffed by a woman, more likely than not staffed alone. They were often near pubs, nightclubs, takeaways, cab ranks. They stayed open late. Ever since the extension of opening hours, branch workers told me, they had been more likely to have to deal with customers who were drunk or on drugs. They also told me about the other sort of difficult customer: the non-customer, bewildered, unstable, otherwise desperate, drifting in because they could not reliably expect to idle anywhere else during unsociable hours without being ushered on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bff7680ed4c68c71720c164d0b55a5583c1a854f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff7680ed4c68c71720c164d0b55a5583c1a854f/0_160_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Branch of Ladbrokes betting shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Betting shops were often near pubs, nightclubs, takeaways, cab ranks. They stayed open late.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An employee of Ladbrokes in Birmingham, Harry Vale, was taken aback in 2013 to be asked by his area manager to start buying food and drink for people who came into his shop. Not just complimentary cups of tea but full meals, from McDonald\u2019s or Greggs. \u201cWe had a ringbinder with their favourites written down,\u201d Vale said, adding that the free food initiative, dreamed up in 2013 and introduced in multiple branches around the Midlands, did not seem to him the wisest arrangement when it came to the issue of vulnerable or unstable people hanging around in betting shops. But, then, Vale was pretty new to the business at the time, and a great many industry conventions can seem baffling to the uninitiated.</p> <p>For instance, there is \u201cbanking\u201d, an industry-wide practice by which betting-shop staff are asked to take excess cash out of their safes and then travel, often with thousands of pounds hidden about their person, to deposit it at the nearest bank or Post Office. (\u201cWe\u2019re only supposed to take \u00a35,000 at a time,\u201d said a branch worker in Oxfordshire, adding that she had once taken as much as \u00a39,000 on a single trip, distributing it about herself in different pockets.)</p> <p>And then there was \u201cthe Ladbrokes Experience\u201d, a company initiative launched in 2013, not long after the Morden murder, that would have Ladbrokes staff come out from behind their locked counters and interact with customers. \u201cWe had to go to our teams and brief this,\u201d recalled the area manager in the north, \u201cafter Andrew Iacovou. That they had to be on the shop floor at all times. That the only time they were allowed to stay behind the counter was if they felt they had a very specific threat.\u201d</p> <p>Mia Whitaker, 21 that year, was working in a Ladbrokes in the Moor area of Sheffield. She had good reason to want to stay behind her counter, her own Ladbrokes experience having been made horrible by two regulars, young taxi drivers, who came in to play the FOBTs or to watch sport. When Whitaker passed them on the shop floor, she recalled, \u201cthey would try to touch my bum and my chest\u201d. They offered taunting comments and gestures, coming in at night and when she was alone in the branch.</p> <p>Whitaker complained to her line manager, and later to Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office. (Ladbrokes told the Guardian: \u201cIf an employee raises concerns, we would investigate and where necessary take action.\u201d) The security office sent a trespass order to Whitaker\u2019s shop, meant for the two men, but when it arrived by post Whitaker said none of her colleagues would present it. Her manager suggested instead that he have a quiet word with the drivers \u2013 they were regular customers. Whitaker didn\u2019t have the nerve to present the trespass order herself. The taxi drivers knew what her hours were, and where her bus stop was. So for more than a year after that, until Whitaker left the job, the men kept coming into their local betting shop, where they could expect to play the machines, or to watch the evening darts, and to harass the 21-year-old who was nominally in charge.</p> <p>Looking back on this later, after a season of contained and uncontained chaos in the betting shops, Whitaker would have reason to be relieved that things only went so far.</p> <h2>8. The wild west</h2> <p><strong>One weekend, the manager of a Ladbrokes</strong> in Scotland was robbed by two men while she was alone in her branch. She later described the experience. \u201cOne had a hammer,\u201d she said. \u201cOne had a screwdriver. One of them pinned me in a corner with a hammer above my head, while the other one emptied the till. To me it felt like hours. I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not getting home from here.\u2019 I thought of the man in London. I thought: \u2018They\u2019re taking me out in a box today.\u2019 I thought: \u2018I\u2019m never going home.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In June 2013, a month after Andrew Iacovou\u2019s killing, a <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/armed-robbers-threaten-betting-shop-5668530\">Ladbrokes in Cardiff was robbed by two men, one carrying what police described as \u201ca small axe\u201d</a>. In July, a Ladbrokes in Newcastle was robbed by a man with a seven-inch vegetable knife. In August, a Coral employee in Ewell, Surrey, was robbed in their branch by two men, claiming to be armed. In September, <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/robbers-threaten-chop-up-betting-5853047\">thieves threatened to \u201cchop up\u201d a Coral employee</a> in his branch in Gorton, Manchester. They stole money and a plug-in telephone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>July 2014: a Ladbrokes in Leyland, Lancashire, a female employee locked in the toilet while \u00a32,500 was stolen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Branch workers around the country described to me a feeling during this period that they were being kept out on the shop floor as a hindrance, but no real impediment, to incident; on display like scarecrows, and about as formidable a deterrent. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.canterburytimes.co.uk/Robber-jailed-10-years/story-20949583-detail/story.html\">Pleasure doing business with you</a>,\u201d a thief who robbed a William Hill in Whitstable in 2013 told staff on his way out. A member of a gang that robbed a Ladbrokes in Darlington in September that year returned to the same shop, the same day, to claim the \u00a3134 he had won on a FOBT while casing the joint. The same month, a man robbed a Ladbrokes in Welwyn Garden City by walking in with a bottle wrapped in wires and tape and telling the woman staffing the shop it was a bomb. She hid behind a door while the thief put the package on the counter and left with \u00a3500. After the bomb squad had been and gone, and the thief traced and arrested, it transpired he was out on licence for another robbery, of another Ladbrokes, with another lone-working employee, in 2010.</p> <p>\u201cIt had become like the wild west,\u201d said a senior figure inside Ladbrokes at the time. \u201cRobberies with shotguns. Staff and customers getting beaten up. People getting hospitalised. We were getting staff coming back to work [after incidents] with PTSD. They were shell-shocked.\u201d The Morden killing had already confirmed in this employee the opinion that nobody was realistically safe to work alone in betting shops. \u201cBut I was not allowed that view. I said [to my superiors]: \u2018This is not good.\u2019 I said: \u2018This is wrong.\u2019 But I was not allowed that view. So you make your noises and you get on with your job.\u201d</p> <p>Others made noises. A petition, launched online, \u201cto make it compulsory for high-street bookmakers to have two members of staff present during opening hours\u201d, gathered 3,824 signatures by November 2013. Nothing changed, and people got on with their jobs.</p> <p>In February 2014, the Labour MP for Islwyn, Chris Evans, raised the matter in a Westminster debate. Evans had once been a low-level betting shop employee himself. He proposed that the government might consider legislation to insist that staff in shops be equipped with panic alarms, so that they could at least call for help if they got into trouble. The Tory MP for Shipley, Philip Davies, responded first, voicing concerns about \u201cputting too much obligation on betting shops\u201d. (Davies has more than once <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/25/tory-mp-benefits-gambling-industry\">been accused by newspapers</a> of receiving personal benefits from links to the gambling industry \u2013 allegations he has denied.) Davies said that \u201cwe could end up, not with single-manned betting shops, but with no betting shops, and nobody in work\u201d. Evans said: \u201cAll I am looking for is simple, common-sense, cheap things \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>The debate puttered out.</p> <p>March 2014: a Stan James in Oxford, one armed robber saying to the other, of a lone-working employee made to kneel on the floor, \u201cShoot him. Shoot him.\u201d April 2014: a Paddy Power in Cheshunt, robbed by armed men in balaclavas on Grand National Saturday. July 2014: a Ladbrokes in Leyland, Lancashire, a female employee locked in the toilet while the shop was robbed of \u00a32,500. September 2014: a William Hill in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, a man carrying a piece of metal piping. October 2014: a Coral in Glasgow, a man carrying a piece of paper. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, just give me the money, I\u2019ve got a knife,\u201d Kenneth Duncan wrote on a betting slip that he handed to 20-year-old Amber Johnstone. \u201cI\u2019m 5ft 6in. I look my age,\u201d Johnstone told me. \u201cI think the guy noticed a young girl on her own in the shop and saw it as a perfect opportunity.\u201d Duncan made off with \u00a3375. Johnstone could not sleep for months afterwards, and eventually entered therapy.</p> <p>Spokespeople for the bookmakers were often careful to stress to the public, after such robberies, that not much money was kept in any one location. \u201cIt is never as much as people think,\u201d said a Coral spokesperson, after the 2013 robbery in Ewell. There were strict limits on the amount of cash kept in branches \u2013 not more than \u00a32,000 in a Ladbrokes, that figure varying slightly from chain to chain. Limits were strictly enforced \u2013 thus the compulsion for employees to pad themselves with cash mid-shift and scurry to the nearest bank \u2013 though branch workers questioned at times just what these limits were in place to protect. It must have been with limited relief, for instance, that bottom-rung staff at William Hill read in a recent brochure for shareholders that the company had managed to reduce the average amount of cash lost during robberies \u2013 down something like \u00a380 per raid on the year.</p> <h2>9. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m alive\u201d </h2> <p><strong>After years of proud defiance,</strong> in 2014 William Hill informed its staff that they would now be asked to work alone in their shops during the evening. A spokesman told me: \u201cAs the over-the-counter part of the business declined, and costs and taxes increased, it made sense to operate to the right level of staffing.\u201d A Hull-based deputy manager recalled: \u201cWe were told over fancy sandwiches in a hotel.\u201d</p> <p>William Hill described staff reaction as \u201cmixed\u201d. To the deputy manager and her colleagues, the move felt like a stunning reversal. The policy was rolled out across two-thirds of William Hill\u2019s shops. By October 2014, executives at the company felt warmly enough towards single-manning to defend it from possible regulation. In a consultation with the government\u2019s Gambling Commission about betting shop licence conditions, William Hill stated it would be \u201can undue and unjustifiable interference for regulators to dictate staffing levels\u201d in betting shops. The deputy manager of a William Hill in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, had not long before been released from hospital, his face unrecognisably bruised and his lung punctured after an attack by two machine gamblers who would not leave when he tried to close up his shop. He had been alone. \u201cThe blame for this criminal act should lay firmly with the perpetrators,\u201d a William Hill spokesman told me, adding: \u201cIt would be wrong to use this case to make a point on lone working generally.\u201d</p> <p>That spring, the Liberal Democrat MP for Carshalton and Wallington, Tom Brake, invited representatives from Ladbrokes to his Westminster office. One of Brake\u2019s constituents had raised concerns about the industry\u2019s response, or lack of it, to Iacovou\u2019s death. The trio of Ladbrokes reps huddled with Brake around a table at Portcullis House and explained a possible new safety initiative. Special software would be installed on betting shop computers, Brake was told, programmed to alert Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office if staff did not use their mouse or keyboard for 45 minutes. In the meeting the MP asked the representatives if they would consider more substantial measures, such as abandoning single-manning. Brake recalled being told no: \u201cThe finances didn\u2019t stack up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bcf0b04b380494a9b6f6375683742798d899ac3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bcf0b04b380494a9b6f6375683742798d899ac3/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Hill better shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018William Hill stated it would be \u2018an undue and unjustifiable interference for regulators to dictate staffing levels\u2019 in betting shops.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mouse-movement initiative was \u201ca nonsense\u201d, a senior figure inside Ladbrokes at the time admitted. \u201cA lot of things can happen to someone in 45 minutes.\u201d (It was never implemented.)</p> <p>Multiple sources suggested that more tangible measures were being considered, such as portable panic alarms. As well as being equipped with a button to contact Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office, the alarms contained motion sensors. Lie flat for more than 15 seconds and an alarm would be triggered. In theory, no staff member wearing an alarm would suffer Iacovou\u2019s fate of prolonged non-discovery. Devices were distributed to about half the company\u2019s shops in 2014 and 2015, at first to the locations deemed most at risk of violent incident. Miss X\u2019s Ladbrokes, in the Leicester area, was not among those branches to get alarms.</p> <p>She was working the evening shift on Friday 5 June 2015. It was a quiet night. TVs in the shop broadcast foreign horse racing and a tennis match on clay at the French Open, but there were no customers in to gamble on it. Miss X whiled away the time behind the counter on her phone. At 8.58pm, a little more than an hour before closing, a regular she recognised called Vijay Singh came into the shop and started playing on the machines. He wore a black T-shirt and faded jeans, and had his dark hair spiked with gel. Singh played for about 25 minutes, gambling and losing around \u00a3400.</p> <p>At 9.24pm, he signalled to Miss X that there was something wrong with his machine. Miss X opened the locked door that secured her service area from the shop floor, and checked the machine. She found no fault. She returned behind her counter and picked up her phone. Minutes later, Singh again said there was a problem with his machine. This time, when Miss X emerged, he grabbed her by the wrists. Singh pushed her backwards through the service area and forced her into a bathroom at the rear of the building.</p> <p>Twenty minutes passed.</p> <p>At 9.49pm, Singh emerged from the rear of the shop with blood on his jeans. On his way towards the exit, he tried to open the till behind the counter, but could not. Instead he picked up a bag of loose coins and left.</p> <p>Another 20 minutes passed.</p> <p>Nobody was aware that there had been an attack in the branch until Miss X regained consciousness, at around 10.10pm, and dialled 999 herself. Hiding in the bathroom, she told the dispatch controller she had been beaten, throttled, threatened with murder and sexually assaulted. Her nose was broken and her neck was fractured.</p> <p>Waiting for officers to arrive, she said to the controller: \u201cI\u2019m so scared.\u201d She said: \u201cHe was on the machines. I think he lost a lot of money.\u201d She said: \u201cI\u2019m in so much pain \u2026 I\u2019m bleeding so much \u2026 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p> <p>The controller asked if there was anybody else in the shop with her.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p> <p>Half a second\u2019s pause. \u201cYou\u2019re just working there on your own, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <h2>10. A judge\u2019s verdict</h2> <p><strong>It was the week leading up</strong> to another Grand National weekend, in April 2016, when I visited Anita Iacovou in Cheam. Her youngest son answered the door. Anita apologised for not being able to stand up; she was suffering from a medical condition that made mobility difficult. Beside her in her chair in the front room she had packets of boxed medicine, a pile of letters and a tabloid newspaper, turned to the runners and riders for the big race. Anita said she was still fond of betting shops, and that she had been down the road to the nearest one that morning. Reaching for the tabloid, she pointed out her pick for the Grand National: number eight, an outsider with odds of 40/1 called On His Own.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anita Iacovou said that Andrew\u2019s death had been denied its only possible positive outcome</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Morden Ladbrokes where her husband worked had not reopened since the day of his death. Sheets of pale plastic had been put up in the windows where the posters had once been. Anita knew what had happened in that other Ladbrokes in the Leicester area in the summer of 2015 \u2013 the Daily Mail had telephoned her afterwards to ask her opinion. She had followed developments in the Midlands since then, with pity and even some guilt. Anita recalled that, at her husband\u2019s funeral in July 2013, she had asked the priest to speak a few words about the fact of Andrew working alone when he died. Senior figures from Ladbrokes were in attendance that day. There was a definite thickening of the atmosphere, guests recalled, when the priest sermonised about the value of money against the value of a human life. The family expected something substantial would change afterwards, and when it didn\u2019t, and then the attack on Miss X happened, Anita said that Andrew\u2019s death had been denied its only possible positive outcome.</p> <p>As we spoke in her front room, Ladbrokes was about to stage its spring AGM. Without knowing it, Anita had been on a list of possible \u201cproblem attendees\u201d at these gatherings ever since 2013. According to a source, it had been feared that she would show up, asking awkward questions; but really Anita\u2019s fight was quieter than that. She only wanted to feel that her husband\u2019s death had meant something.</p> <p>William Hill continues to single-man its shops. A spokesman told me the company was \u201ccontinually monitoring\u201d the situation, but it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d they would all be dual-manned again. Betfred, Coral, Paddy Power and Stan James continue to single-man. Ladbrokes, in the weeks after the attack in the Leicester area, quietly suspended single-manning in surrounding shops, but it was soon reinstated.</p> <p>The company\u2019s CEO, Jim Mullen, decided last year that single-scheduling would become voluntary for staff working after 7pm. This opt-out policy would be extended gradually across the Ladbrokes\u2019 estate and extra staff hired, employees were told. They could expect it in every branch by January 2016. In January 2016, the date for completion was pushed back to October 2016. Scepticism had already set in behind counters about that word \u201cvoluntary\u201d. Some had already tried to opt out of single-manning, they told me, and had been pressured into reconsidering. \u201cThreatened with being relocated,\u201d a manager in north Wales reported. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice that doesn\u2019t really seem like a choice,\u201d said a manager in Edinburgh. (Ladbrokes said: \u201cWe would never tolerate victimisation of an employee for raising a concern of any nature.\u201d)</p> <p>Vijay Singh was arrested on 7 June 2015, two days after his attack on Miss X. He was in hiding at his brother-in-law\u2019s house, where bloody jeans were found stuffed in a cabinet. When Singh\u2019s brother-in-law was interviewed by police, he disclosed that the first thing Singh had said after coming out of Ladbrokes on the night of the attack was: \u201cI\u2019ve just killed somebody.\u201d Only later did Singh learn Miss X had survived the ordeal. When he was brought to trial at Stafford crown court in May 2016, charged with attempted murder, sexual assault by penetration, and theft, Miss X testified for the prosecution.</p> <p>The trial lasted just over two weeks \u2013 ample time for more incidents to occur. In Manchester, police pursued an eastern European man who had spent \u201cseveral hours\u201d playing a FOBT in a city-centre Ladbrokes, waiting for the manager to be left alone, before pulling a knife. In Ware, a pregnant Ladbrokes employee was robbed in her shop. Meanwhile, in Stafford, at the end of a draining trial, the jury in the case was sent out to deliberate.</p> <p>They were gone for hours. The court\u2019s public gallery emptied, and a representative from Ladbrokes, who for days had been transcribing the events of the trial on a laptop, went for his lunch. I walked to the nearest betting shop \u2013 a Ladbrokes on Stafford\u2019s main shopping parade, next to an off-licence and below a solicitor\u2019s office. At the back of the branch, behind the counter, a young employee read a newspaper. He had a chunky plastic panic alarm clipped awkwardly to the collar of his red polo shirt. On the shop floor, an old man waited for the two o\u2019clock at Kempton. By the door were the four FOBTs, one taken up by a middle-aged man playing a puzzle game called The Sky\u2019s The Limit, another taken by a thirtysomething playing roulette. The other machines were idle, their high-definition screens programmed to flash through routine announcements: ads for the games that might be played on them, and bald warnings about the risks of playing these games incautiously. One machine flashed a message, black-on-red, that told customers not to gamble when upset. The other said in capital letters: \u201cSTAY IN CONTROL.\u201d</p> <p>After five hours\u2019 deliberation, the jury returned with a verdict. Singh was guilty. Judge Michael Chambers, presiding, described the crimes as \u201chorrendous\u201d and said that Singh could expect \u201csubstantial imprisonment\u201d. Preparing to dismiss the jury, Chambers thanked them for their time and said that, as he was sure they would agree, one aspect of the case had been especially troubling. How, Chambers wondered aloud, could Ladbrokes ever have allowed a young woman to be working on her own that night? The judge called it \u201cforeseeable\u201d that someone like Singh would take advantage of such a situation. \u201cIn my view,\u201d Chambers said, \u201cLadbrokes\u2019 actions in this case can be viewed as extremely negligent.\u201d</p> <p>The judge then turned from the jury to look at the public gallery, where the Ladbrokes representative sat behind a laptop. \u201cI hope,\u201d the judge said, slowly and clearly, \u201cyou will record that.\u201d The representative typed.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",
