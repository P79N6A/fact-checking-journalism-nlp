      "bodyText": "Consumers are feeling more buoyant than they have since the early 2000s, according to a measure of confidence that jumped by six points in June. The post-election poll of consumer sentiment will be widely interpreted as heralding a strong summer for high street shops, online sales and the leisure industry, which has missed out on much of the economy\u2019s recovery while households remained nervous about spending. The GfK/KPMG consumer confidence index saw all six elements of its overall score rise to levels \u201cnot seen since the late nineties or early days of the noughties\u201d, GfK said. Spokesman Joe Staton said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a dramatic uptick in confidence this month, a real post-election bounce that\u2019s put a spring in the step of consumers across the UK. \u201cAcross all key measures we\u2019re reporting higher levels of financial optimism for both our own personal situation and for the general economy as a whole for the coming 12 months.\u201d Retailers will be particularly encouraged by the leap in the number of shoppers who agreed that \u201cnow is a good time for people to make major purchases such as furniture or electrical goods\u201d. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cIn addition to very high consumer confidence, earnings growth is improving, inflation is negligible and employment is high and rising. \u201cConsumer price inflation was just 0.1% in May, and it is likely to hover around this level through the summer before trending up gradually. \u201cFurthermore, annual earnings growth picked up to 2.7% in the three months to April, which was the highest three-month rate since the end of 2008.\u201d Bank of England figures showed that consumer credit slipped to \u00a31bn in May from \u00a31.2bn the previous month, though marking an 8.5% gain on a year ago.

      "bodyText": "And finally, the threat that Greeks are voting on their eurozone future on Sunday makes the front page of the Tuesday\u2019s Guardian and the Financial Times: Guardian: Europe\u2019s big guns warn Greek voters that a no vote means euro exit FT: EU tells Greeks: You\u2019re voting on the euro Tuesday is going to be historic too -- with Greece\u2019s bailout on track to expire at the end of the day, and an IMF default perhaps inevitable too. And as it\u2019s just turned midnight in the UK, I\u2019d better stop. Thanks all, and goodnight. GW Before we go....It\u2019s getting nasty in Greece tonight. If you thought Syriza knew how to turn a tough phrase then listen to this. The anti-capitalist bloc, Antarsya, has in the last few minutes declared that the EU president and German chancellor has declared \u201ca war of fear\u201d on Greece. Helena Smith reports. The far-left Antarsya movement- ever growing in popularity and ever present in workers\u2019 associations and trade unions - has just issued a blistering attack against the \u201cblack forces of capital\u201d accusing Europe\u2019s leaders of trying not only to influence Sunday\u2019s vote but entrap Greeks in \u201ca war of fear.\u201d \u201cFrom Juncker, Merkel and Hollande to Samaras\u2019 New Democracy, Pasok and Potami , they are erecting a nightmarish web over the people of Greece,\u201d the party railed in a statement released after midnight. \u201cA web of war and insecurity with the aim of blackmailing an entire people into submission so that they can defame it ... and loot what has remained of the crumbs with which it has been forced to live in recent years. So that they can snatch the last piece of bread from the table of the unemployed and pensioners, to steal what has remained unsold from state assets, to destroy every last worker\u2019s right and to eradicate what he has gained with sacrifice and struggle.\u201d Yet another example of anti-EU sentiment tonight: The were also protests in Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second city, tonight - the AFP newswire reports that around 17,000 people took part in protests in Athens and Thessaloniki. AFP explains: \u201cOur lives do not belong to the creditors!\u201d read banners held aloft by demonstrators, many of whom support Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and said they would heed his call to vote against the latest deal in Sunday\u2019s referendum -- despite risks it could send the country crashing out of the eurozone. \u201cThe people of Greece have made many sacrifices. What interests me is not the euro but guaranteeing a dignified way of life for the next generations,\u201d 50-year-old Vanguelis Tseres, who has been unemployed since the start of the debt crisis in 2010, told AFP in Syntagma square in the capital. Some 17,000 anti-bailout demonstrators rally in Greece Over in Athens the governing Syriza party has issued a statement applauding what it described as a huge turn-out for tonight\u2019s rally. \u201cToday, in Syntagma, thousands of citizens responded to the ultimatums [made by creditors],\u201d the statement said. \u201cPeople said a big and resounding \u201cno\u201d to blackmail, terrorisation, threats internally and externally, and a big \u201cyes\u201d to democracy, dignity, popular sovereignty, values that are the foundation of modern European civilisation.\u201d \u201cIn these historic moments, the \u201cstruggle of this land for life\u201d will be expressed next Sunday with a clear \u201cNO,\u201d the announcement said. The ratings agencies are busy tonight - Fitch has just downgraded Greece\u2019s major banks to \u2018restricted default\u2019. It took the move following the imposition of capital controls - had that not happened, Fitch says, they would not have survived long: The downgrade of NBG\u2019s, Piraeus\u2019, Eurobank\u2019s and Alpha\u2019s VR to \u2018f\u2019 from \u2018ccc\u2019 reflects Fitch\u2019s view that these banks have failed and would have defaulted had capital controls not been imposed, given the high rates of ongoing deposit withdrawal and the ECB\u2019s decision on 28 June 2015 not to raise the Bank of Greece\u2019s Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) ceiling. Here\u2019s the statement. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Henley is in Syntagma Square tonight, and reports that No protesters are united behind one cause - bringing Greece\u2019s dignity back: He writes: Rallying in front of the Greek parliament on Monday night, supporters of the Syriza-led government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras demanded an end to the \u201ceconomic asphyxia\u201d and \u201csocial catastrophe\u201d of austerity \u2013 and the return of dignity. \u201cI\u2019m here to support my country,\u201d said Katherine, a psychologist. \u201cI want freedom for my country and dignity for its people, because right now my country does not have its freedom and its people do not have their dignity. It might be very hard work after Sunday, but freedom needs hard work.\u201d Waving banners and placards calling for a no vote in Sunday\u2019s referendum on whether Athens should accept or reject the reforms-for-aid package Greece\u2019s creditors have said must be agreed before they will extend the country\u2019s bailout, the demonstrators acknowledged the risk that Greece could crash out of the eurozone (as many EU leaders warned today). \u201cWe probably have a lot to lose if we leave Europe,\u201d said Alex Zoubouglou, a photographer. \u201cBut it will be worth if if that is what it takes to recover our dignity. We\u2019re here because we\u2019re fed up with being treated as if we were ignorant. We\u2019re well educated, we\u2019re civilised, we\u2019ve been around and we\u2019re being being treated like so much less.\u201d Here\u2019s Jon\u2019s full dispatch: A treat for non-Greek readers - here\u2019s an English translation of Alexis Tsipras calling for the Greek people to vote \u201cno\u201d on Sunday, and predicting that lenders won\u2019t push for Grexit. Our Athens correspondent watched the whole interview, and confirms that Tsipras hinted that he might resign if the Yes campaign wins. Channelling FDR again.... Alexis Tsipras is suggesting that he\u2019s still prepared to negotiate, while also warning that Greece won\u2019t repay \u20ac1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund tomorrow. For anyone just tuning in, here\u2019s our latest news story on today\u2019s major developments in Greece: Relations between Alexis Tsipras and Jean-Claude Juncker look as damaged as ever, judging by tonight\u2019s TV interview. The Greek PM has criticised the EC president for toeing the IMF\u2019s line, rather than proposing measure in line with European values. Speaking of the IMF, Tsipras suggests that Athens could possibly meet the \u20ac1.6bn repayment due to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, if creditors propose a workable deal extremely soon (however there\u2019s no sign that is about to happen....) This looks like good news tonight for Greece\u2019s pensioners, hit hard by the imposition of capital controls: The turnout at tonight\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d protest is reminiscent of the major demonstrations seen back in 2011 and 2012, although there\u2019s no sign of the violence seen at times back then. Tsipras says he will \u2018respect the outcome\u2019 of the referendum, and act in accordance with the Greek constitution -- which suggests he\u2019s resign if the public vote Yes. As if there wasn\u2019t enough riding on this vote already.... The Greek PM rejects the suggestion that a No vote will lead inevitably to Grexit -- that would be simply too costly for the other side.... Tsipras is rebutting the suggestion that he wrecked hopes of a good deal by walking away: Alexis Tsipras is being interviewed on the ERT TV station now. After some tumultuous days, the Greek PM is appealing to the people to vote No on Sunday, to ensure Greece has a better future: \u201cWe\u2019re asking you to reject it with all our strength\u2019\u201d. Tsipras is rebutting Jean-Claude\u2019s Juncker\u2019s attack this morning. We did everything humanely possible in the five months since winning power, he says. and blames the Institutions for the failure to reach a deal in recent days. And Tsipras is adamant that a NO vote on Sunday will give Athens the mandate to seek a better deal. Tonight\u2019s demonstration was firm, but gentle No to the deal on offer from creditors, says Phoebe Greenwood in her last video clip from Syntagma Square tonight. US stock markets are still in the red. The Dow is down over 1.5%, the S&amp;P 1.7% and the Nasdaq has suffered the most at over 2%. Still US investors don\u2019t seem overly concerned about Greece. Jack Ablin, chief strategist at BMP Private Bank writes: The breakdown of talks between the Greek government and the eurozone leadership has pushed global stock markets lower and volatility higher, suggesting the news was a surprise. However, the most likely scenario in the event of a Greek default and the country\u2019s departure from the eurozone is not a global economic crisis... However, we must recognize that while traders could take advantage of near-term dips, most equity markets are relatively expensive; a modest pullback probably doesn\u2019t represent buying opportunities for longer-term investors. We will continue to monitor global economic progress, liquidity levels and momentum \u2013 and the good news is that they all remain positive. This is a must-read piece: Ian Traynor, our Europe editor, sums up how Europe\u2019s most powerful leaders have lined up to attack Alexis Tsipras, in a desperate attempt to save the euro and avoid Grexit: A teaser: In what was arguably the biggest speech of his career, the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, appeared before a packed press hall in Brussels against a giant backdrop of the Greek and EU flags. He was impassioned, bitter and disingenuous in appealing to the Greek people to vote yes to the euro and his bailout terms, arguing that he and the creditors \u2013 rather than the Syriza government \u2013 had the best interests of Greeks at heart. Tsipras had lied to his people, deceived and betrayed Europe\u2019s negotiators and distorted the bailout terms that were shredded when the negotiations collapsed and the referendum was called, he said. \u201cI feel betrayed. The Greek people are very close to my heart. I know their hardship \u2026 they have to know the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to ask the Greek people to vote yes \u2026 no would mean that Greece is saying no to Europe.\u201d In a country where an estimated 11,000 people have killed themselves during the hardship wrought by austerity, Juncker offered unfortunate advice. \u201cI say to the Greeks, don\u2019t commit suicide because you\u2019re afraid of dying,\u201d he said. Juncker\u2019s extraordinary performance sounded and looked as if he were already mourning the passing of a Europe to which he has dedicated his long political career. His 45-minute speech was both proprietorial and poignant about his vision, which seems to be giving way to a rawer and rowdier place... Here\u2019s the full piece on another momentous day for Europe: Alexis Tsipras must be stopped: the underlying message of Europe\u2019s leaders S&amp;P has downgraded Greece because, unless circumstances change for the better, it feels Athens will probably default on its commercial debt during the next six months. In other words, not bonds held by the IMF or the ECB, but by a bank, insurance group, etc. The decicson was prompted by: ...the central government\u2019s decision to reject official creditors\u2019 loan proposals and instead schedule a national referendum on whether to accept the terms of the proposals. The deviation also reflects further deterioration since June 10 of liquidity conditions in Greece\u2019s banking system, which depends heavily on official financing from the Eurosystem, the eurozone\u2019s monetary authority. This led to the imposition of emergency capital controls in Greece as of yesterday. S&amp;P have also warned that Greece\u2019s economy will shrink by 3% this year -- and even more if the banks stay shut. S&amp;P- INTERPRET GREECE GOVT\u2019S INABILITY TO AGREE OFFICIAL CREDITORS ON A LOAN PROGRAM AS A SIGN IT WILL LIKELY MISS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS DUE ON JUNE 30 S&amp;P SAYS AN EXTENDED BANK HOLIDAY INVOLVING CAPITAL CONTROLS WILL FURTHER WEIGH ON GREECE\u2019S ECONOMY, \u201cWHICH WE EXPECT WILL CONTRACT BY 3% THIS YEAR\u201d Ever quick on the uptake, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s have just downgraded Greece and warned that there is a 50% chance of a Grexit.

And nor have the thousands of other people who have massed outside the Greek parliament: Here\u2019s proof of the Greek crisis\u2019s global impact - a protest calling for Greek debt relief is taking place in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square now. More pictures of the day\u2019s rallies: Just for clarification, the deadline for Greece to pay the \u20ac1.6bn due to the International Monetary Fund is 6pm Washington DC time or 11pm BST. The weekend\u2019s dramatic events which seem to bring Greece closer to default and perhaps an exit from the eurozone have sent investors to the exits. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 1.97% to 6620.48 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 3.56% to 11,083.20 France\u2019s Cac closed 3.74% to 4869.82 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 5.17% to 22,569.95 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.56% to 10,853.9 The Athens market was of course closed On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 1.37% or 246 points. The euro fell against most major currencies, but came off its worst levels with talk of intervention by the Swiss central bank to weaken the Swiss franc and some buying of the euro by investors still hopeful of a positive outcome to the current dispute. The European Central bank should see if it can assist Greece ahead of the referendum, said ECB board member and president of the National Bank of Austria Ewald Nowotny: The rallies are beginning in Athens, my colleague Jon Henley tweets: Greece will not make the \u20ac1.6bn due to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal is reporting: Greece won\u2019t make a debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund due Tuesday, a senior Greek government official said Monday. Earlier this month, Greece had notified the IMF it plans to bundle its loan repayments falling due this month into one payment of around 1.6 billion euros, which is due Tuesday. The IMF has said that Greece will immediately be in arrears if it fails to make the debt repayment. Here is the full text of George Osborne\u2019s speech on Greece: A number of academics, including former Archibishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, have written to us to support the Greeks and calling on the European union to recommit to the principles of democracy: Over the past five years, the EU and the IMF have imposed unprecedented austerity on Greece. It has failed badly. The economy has shrunk by 26%, unemployment has risen to 27%, youth unemployment to 60% and, the debt-to-GDP ratio jumped from 120% to 180%. The economic catastrophe has led to a humanitarian crisis, with more than 3 million people on or below the poverty line. Against this background, the Greek people elected the Syriza-led government on 25 January with a clear mandate to put an end to austerity. In the ensuing negotiations, the government made it clear that the future of Greece is in the Eurozone and the EU. The lenders, however, insisted on the continuation of their failed recipe, refused to discuss a write down of the debt \u2013 which the IMF is on record as considering unviable \u2013 and finally, on 26 June, issued an ultimatum to Greece by means of a non-negotiable package that would entrench austerity. This was followed by a suspension of liquidity to the Greek banks and the imposition of capital controls. In this situation, the government has asked the Greek people to decide the future of the country in a referendum to be held next Sunday. We believe that this ultimatum to the Greek people and democracy should be rejected. The Greek referendum gives the European Union a chance to restate its commitment to the values of the enlightenment \u2013 equality, justice, solidarity \u2013 and to the principles of democracy on which its legitimacy rests. The place where democracy was born gives Europe the opportunity to recommit to its ideals in the 21st century. Etienne Balibar Costas Douzinas Barbara Spinelli Rowan Williams Immanuel Wallerstein Slavoj Zizek Michael Mansfield Judith Butler Chantal Mouffe Homi Bhabha Wendy Brown Eric Fassin Tariq Ali More on the European Central Bank\u2019s support for Greek banks. The bank rejected a Greek request for $6bn of extra emergency funds on Sunday, Reuters reported earlier. Now it appears the ECB will continue to give limited support to Greek banks until the July 5 referendum, allowing them to tap what remains of the emergency funding already allocated, says Reuters. The size of the problem is shown by talk the Greek central bank may have had less than \u20ac150m to give to retail banks when it was agreed to impose capital controls on Sunday, according to a financial source in Athens. Southern Europe editor John Hooper says that according to the source, at the start of the weekend, there was \u20ac2.25bn available. But withdrawals on Saturday were around \u20ac1bn and reached \u20ac1.1bn the next day. \u201cThat is without factoring in withdrawals in the private banking sector whose figures are not circulated,\u201d said the source. More on the Greek banks in the UK: There are four Greek banks operating in London: Two are branches of Greek banks Pireaus and National Bank of Greece and so regulated domestically, one is a branch of a Luxembourg arm of Eurobank while another is a subsidiary of Alpha Bank. Located on Cannon Street, in the heart of the financial district, customers of Alpha Bank are regulated by the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority and not impacted by the situation in Greece. Senior official Lindsay Mackay said: \u201cIt is a UK legal entity with a separate banking licence and separate capital base.\u201d Some customers - who tend to be wealthier - have moved their business into the London arm in recent years. But any customers of the Greek arm are still impacted by the bank closures. A sign explains that online banking is unavailable and accounts not accessible. The Cannon Street outlet is empty of customers although queries are coming in over the phone. Tourists can still withdraw \u20ac600 a day but Osborne warned this could change, and ATMs could run out of cash. So the advice is to take enough cash for the duration of their holiday, and to cover emergencies and delays. Osborne said no one should underestimate the impact of a Greek exit on the UK economy. The four biggest Greek banks all have branches in the UK with total deposits between them of \u00a3225m. All four are open in the UK and protection of deposits is regulated by Greek authorities. One bank, Alpha, has a UK subsidiary with half a billion pounds of assets and deposits are regulated by the Bank of England. Osborne said the referendum was a matter for the Greek people. But it was effectively a choice as to whether they leave the eurozone. UK Chancellor George Osborne is now speaking in the commons. He has spoken to fellow finance ministers in the past 48 hours. \u201cWe hope for the best, but prepare for the worst,\u201d he says. Whether Greece should have joined the euro in the first place, its exit would be traumatic. 29-Jun-2015 17:19:15 - UK\u2019S OSBORNE SAYS NOBODY SHOULD UNDERESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF A GREEK EURO EXIT ON THE EUROPEAN AND UK ECONOMIES 29-Jun-2015 17:20:18 - UK\u2019S OSBORNE SAYS HIS FINANCE MINISTRY AND BANK OF ENGLAND STAND READY TO ENSURE STABILITY OF BRITISH ECONOMY IN EVENT OF GREEK EURO EXIT 29-Jun-2015 17:21:55 - UK\u2019S OSBORNE SAYS BRITISH GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO PAY PENSIONS TO BRITONS IN GREECE DESPITE CRISIS The UK treasury has issued guidance for UK firms dealing with Greece: 29-Jun-2015 17:10:24 - UK FINANCE MINISTRY SAYS ISSUES GUIDELINES FOR UK FIRMS AFFECTED BY GREEK CAPITAL CONTROLS 29-Jun-2015 17:11:28 - UK FINANCE MINISTRY SAYS UK FIRMS WHICH TRADE WITH GREECE SHOULD \u201cFIND OUT WHETHER CUSTOMERS CAN STILL PAY YOU\u201d 29-Jun-2015 17:13:05 UK FINANCE MINISTRY SAYS UK BRANCHES OF GREEK BANKS NOT APPLYING CAPITAL CONTROLS BUT MAY FACE DISRUPTION (courtesy Reuters) Economist Joseph Stiglitz has looked at the options in the Greek referendum, and he concludes neither alternative \u2013 approval or rejection of the troika\u2019s terms \u2013 would be easy, and both carry huge risks. But in his latest Project Syndicate piece he says: We should be clear: almost none of the huge amount of money loaned to Greece has actually gone there. It has gone to pay out private-sector creditors \u2013 including German and French banks. Greece has gotten but a pittance, but it has paid a high price to preserve these countries\u2019 banking systems. The IMF and the other \u201cofficial\u201d creditors do not need the money that is being demanded. Under a business-as-usual scenario, the money received would most likely just be lent out again to Greece. But, again, it\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about using \u201cdeadlines\u201d to force Greece to knuckle under, and to accept the unacceptable \u2013 not only austerity measures, but other regressive and punitive policies. And he says he knows which way he would choose in the referendum in the full piece here: Here\u2019s a useful timeline of the weekend\u2019s dramatic events in the Greek crisis, from my colleague Katie Allen: Another sign - if needed - that the current Greek crisis has repercussions beyond just the eurozone. French president Francois Hollande has been on the phone with US president Barack Obama about the Greek situation, Reuters is reporting. The two reportedly agreed to work together to help restart dialogue on the crisis. The current crisis is also having an impact on the arts, in particular the planned Athens Festival. Theatre producer Oli Sones says a cast of 23 performers were due to fly out to Athens tomorrow to perform Jesus Christ Superstar at the Herodes Atticus as part of the festival. But the promotor has now decided to cancel the shows: Ahead of UK chancellor George Osborne speaking in parliament about Greece, UBS has taken a look at the possible impact on the UK of the Greek crisis: While the direct exposure of the UK to Greece is very limited, it is the potential for contagion that will likely be of most concern. For now the main focus is on the impact on financial markets. The monetary policy committee has scope to watch how the Greek referendum unfolds. If it needs to act, we believe the Committee is likely to sound rhetorically dovish first and foremost. After that, it has a range of options. The most immediate asset market transmission from greater Grexit risk to the UK is likely through the currency. At the Asia open the euro/pound had already breached 0.70 before recovering. We expect the euro to continue trading heavily in the coming days and, barring a surge in general dollar demand, the Bank of England exchange rate index could break 93, dragging sterling further away from the Bank\u2019s own assumptions (at 90) and comfort levels. Rhetoric on the currency may rise but more explicit action looks unlikely barring serious contagion. Here\u2019s confirmation of Alexis Tsipras\u2019 appearance on television tonight, from the man himself: Two may be a coincidence, three is a trend, and four looks rather like a plan. The eurozone\u2019s three largest economies have all come out today and told Greece exactly what they believe Sunday\u2019s referendum is about, and it\u2019s not simply about choosing the old reform offer. Matteo Renzi warning that Greece is voting to choose between the euro and the drachma makes a hat-trick. France went first - with Francois Hollande appearing outside the Elysse Palace to declare: It is democracy, it is the right of the Greek people to decide what they want for their future. What is at stake is whether or not Greeks want to stay in the eurozone (or) take the risk of leaving,\u201d And then came Germany -- although Angela Merkel left it to her coalition partner, Sigmar Gabriel, to deliver the news: And on top of that, don\u2019t forget Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s plea to Greece not to break away from Europe. On the other hand, Greece is actually asking its people to vote on whether or not to accept the last proposal from its lenders: Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi has added his weight to those warning that Greece is voting on its eurozone membership on Sunday. The leftwing PM has just tweeted that Greeks aren\u2019t refereeing a bout between their prime minister and Brussels, it\u2019s about much, much more. Renzi had been one of Tsipras\u2019s closer allies \u2013 jokingly giving him a tie earlier this year, and even joshing around at Thursday\u2019s EUCO summit: It feels so long ago.... The door is still open for negotiations between Greece and its creditors, Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem has said. He said he was disappointed that after months of negotiations, Greece had ended discussions, according to Reuters. But he added: \u201cI continue to say our door is open, although the options and the time are very limited. \u201cThis really is about the future of Greece and also of the eurozone, but mainly of Greece.\u201d With Wall Street now open, America is now joining in the global sell-off. Our correspondent Rupert Neate reports: US markets fell sharply on Monday morning as fears about a Greek exit from the Euro spread across the Atlantic. The Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were down as much as 0.9% shortly after the markets opened. Nearly all world markets fell on Monday, with most suffering much greater falls than the US, whose economy has little exposure to Greece.\u201cA week ago, it seemed very likely that we were close to having a resolution, and now all of a sudden we\u2019re waking up to capital controls?\u201d Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, told Reuters. \u201cI\u2019m not confident that today reflects all the bad news that could happen. Investors are really bumping up the odds that Greece will exit the euro.\u201d Away from the financial markets \u2013 and the political blame game, and the queues, and the empty restaurants \u2013 there are people in Greece who have already lost everything since the crisis began. Jon Henley visited one couple who lost their job, then their home, and would be sleeping on the streets if their friends hadn\u2019t rallied around and paid for a caravan... Jon writes: The caravan is old, but spotless. It is home to Georgios Karvouniaris, 61, and his sister Barbara, 64, two Greeks for whom all the Brussels wrangling over VAT rates, corporation tax and pension reforms has meant nothing \u2013 because they have nothing, no income of any kind. Next Sunday\u2019s referendum \u2013 which, if the country stays solvent that long, will either send Greece back to the negotiating table with its creditors or precipitate its exit from the eurozone \u2013 is unlikely to affect them much either. \u201cI do not see how any of it will change our lives. I have no hope, anyway,\u201d said Georgios, sitting in a scavenged plastic garden chair beneath a parasol liberated from a skip. Here\u2019s the full piece: Meanwhile, some Greek bank branches may open again on Thursday, a government official has said. Specifically, 850 branches are expected to open to allow for the payment of pensions, although they will be shut for other business, according to Reuters. The official also suggested that the \u20ac60 daily limit could also be raised, but only if the European Central Bank continues to support the banks though its emergency funding programme. Reuters has heard that Greece asked the European Central Bank for \u20ac6bn in extra liquidity at yesterday\u2019s emergency meeting. As we already know, the ECB rejected the request and left ELA at its current \u20ac89bn, following the news that Greece\u2019s bailout would expire on 30 June. I think \u20ac6bn would have been the biggest jump in ELA funding since the Greek crisis started, showing just how much cash was taken out over the weekend - and how much more the Bank of Greece was likely to leave if the banks reopened. Greek journalists are flagging up that Alexis Tsipras may address the nation again this evening - 9pm local time or 7pm BST. Back in Brussels, European Parliament president Martin Schulz is holding a press conference \u2013 and urging a Yes vote on Sunday. He\u2019s also warning that the referendum is effectively on Greece\u2019s membership of the eurozone. So much for Angela Merkel\u2019s claim that no-one should put pressure on the Greek people \u2026 Schulz is also suggesting he might visit Greece to put forward Brussels\u2019 case. Phoebe Greenwood has also met with a restaurant owner in Plaka, the historical Athens district close to the Acropolis, whose tables are unusually deserted today: My colleague Phoebe Greenwood reports from this cash machine in Syntagma Square which re-opened this lunchtime: Merkel is downplaying the potential impact of a Greek default, saying finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has already said Germany is well prepared. And the German chancellor suggests there\u2019s no legal basis to keep providing funds to Greece after its bailout expires tomorrow night. Merkel isn\u2019t rushing back to Brussels either: Angela Merkel is now suggesting that no-one should try to influence the Greek referendum..... (surely that ship sailed over the horizon mid-way though Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s speech?!). ....we just need to point out the consequences, Merkel adds. Berlin is also adamant that Greece is voting on its eurozone membership next Sunday. Sigmar Gabriel, the German vice-chancellor (and social democrat), is alongside Merkel at the press conference. He\u2019s being extremely critical of Alexis Tsipras, saying the Greek PM threatens the entire eurozone. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor is covering the press conference. Angela Merkel is talking about how the eurozone is now facing a decisive challenge. She\u2019s not ruling out more talks with Greece after Sunday\u2019s referendum, but insisting that Athens was given a generous offer German chancellor Angela Merkel has begun giving her press conference on the Greek crisis -- here\u2019s a livefeed. A reader, Martin Royalton-Kisch, has got in touch to report that the situation in Kolonaki, central Athens, remains calm. No panic at the two banks and two supermarkets there, he tells me. At the Carrefour Express, there was just one customer paying, at the other, about 6, a normal Monday. In another surprise development, it has emerged that the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras spoke with EU Commission chief by phone just before Juncker\u2019s press conference in Brussels. The Greek prime minister made it clear that \u201cimpeding the democratic expression of the Greek people by closing banks is outside the democratic tradition of Europe.\u201d \u201cHe also told the president of the commission that he, himself, as as European citizen ought to defend the traditions of Europe so the Greek people can decide on Sunday undistracted.\u201d \u201cWith this in mind, he [Tsipras] asked [Juncker] to help so that the [bailout] programme could be extended by a few days and liquidity restored to the country\u2019s banking system.\u201d And now it emerges that even that symbol of democracy itself, the Acropolis, has not been spared the spat now dominating Greece\u2019s relations with creditors. The Greek culture minister has JUST released an announcement saying that with cash being sparse, visitors and organised groups, can now pay for entrance tickets to the site with plastic. In a statement, it said: \u201cIt has been a demand for many years and now will be fulfilled. Especially for as long as there is a difficulty with liquid cash groups of tourists will be given vouchers.\u201d In a surprise move the deputy transport minister Christos Spirtzis has decided that all forms of transport across Athens\u2019 transit network will be free until after the referendum is held. Trams, trolleys, buses and trains are included in the decision and will be running free services until next Monday. Here\u2019s our Europe editor Ian Traynor on Juncker\u2019s speech: Back in the UK, David Cameron has called a top-level contingency planning meeting on Greece, with Bank of England governor Mark Carney and chancellor George Osborne. It will look at the impact on Greek bank branches in the UK, and \u2018consular issues\u2019, says the PM\u2019s spokeswoman. Juncker\u2019s appeal for Greeks to vote \u201cYes\u201d in the referendum next week is likely to further inflame spirits, writes Helena Smith from Athens. The EU president\u2019s interjection today will not go down well with the NO camp or the government, whose ministers this morning, have been busily accusing creditors of trying to influence the outcome by \u201cterrorising\u201d the Greek people. \u201cJuncker was clearly panic-stricken throughout the press conference because Tsipras has not only wrong-footed them but outmaneuvered them,\u201d said Alexis Mantheakis, former spokesman of the right-wing LAOS party in comments that will echo widely. \u201cThe Greek government called their bluff after the \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 ultimatum to Greece. Tsipras is no longer in the orbit of their control. He is the bird that has flown the cage.\u201d And the Greek government has shot back with a fiery response to Juncker\u2019s claims. In a terse one-line statement, the government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides said: \u201cThe indispensable factor as a sign of goodwill and credibility in any negotiation is sincerity.\u201d And here\u2019s some instant reaction from Greeks to Juncker\u2019s intervention \u2013 his comment about \u201cnot choosing suicide over death\u201d has not gone down well. Here\u2019s how European correspondents are responding to Juncker\u2019s speech: When the full tale of the eurozone crisis is finally written, the last hour deserves a special mention. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, has made a remarkable intervention into the Greek crisis in what looks like desperate, last-gasp bid to prevent the country ploughing out of the eurozone. He has effectively told the Greek people that they are choosing between the euro and the exit door on Sunday, that their government has lied to them, and that he has been their friend and ally at the negotiating table. Underneath it all, the desperate fear that the European project is swerving off course and about to lose its first member. Juncker confirmed the claim that Greece\u2019s creditors were prepared to discuss debt relief as part of a future aid deal, before Alexis Tsipras shattered hopes of a breakthrough last weekend. A clearly wounded Juncker spoke of feeling \u201cdeeply distressed and saddened by the spectacle that Europe gave last Saturday\u201d. In a single night, the European conscience has taken a heavy blow. Goodwill has somewhat evaporated. Crucially, Juncker is not offering a new compromise. Instead, he is arguing that the Commission was making a fair proposal \u2013 not \u201cstupid austerity\u201d \u2013 for the Greek people. But his comments on the referendum are jaw-dropping: telling Greeks to vote Yes in Sunday\u2019s referendum is one thing, but warning \u201cnot to commit suicide for fear of death\u201d is another level altogether. And he has raised the stakes in Sunday\u2019s referendum to the highest level possible, by warning that \u201cthe whole planet\u201d will see a no vote as a declaration that Greece wants to leave Europe. Ever the polyglot, Juncker concludes a remarkable session with a few words of Greek. And that just highlights how he\u2019s now trying to reach out to those in Greece, who he insists he cares deeply about. Snap summary to follow... A No vote would be disastrous for Greece, Juncker reiterates. The entire planet would take it as a sign that the Greek people want to distance themselves from Europe. Juncker is asked how much damage has been done to relations between Brussels and the current Greek government. The referendum came as a surprise, Juncker says. Alexis Tsipras didn\u2019t tell me, but I don\u2019t blame him personally. WOW. The head of the European Commission has effectively said Sunday\u2019s referendum is a vote on Greece\u2019s membership of the eurozone. I ask the Greek people to vote Yes in Sunday\u2019s referendum, says Juncker. Vote Yes to stay in the euro. And he adds: I say to the Greek people, you should not commit suicide because you are afraid of death. Juncker says the Greek people deserve to know the whole story -- accusing Athens of not telling the truth. The door is still open, Juncker says, but he\u2019s not announcing a new proposal now. We really moved mountains, until the last minute, until the Greek authorities closed the door... So, despite reports, I am not announcing anything new today, he adds. Juncker\u2019s claim that Greece\u2019s creditors never wanted to cut Greek pensions has sent eyebrows soaring in the press room: Juncker is now insisting that Greece\u2019s creditors were ready to discuss debt relief, in line with a pledge made in 2012. Mr Tsipras knows that. [that 2012 pledge has been sitting dormant ever since, though] Yes, it was a demanding package, says Juncker - but also a fair one. We did not propose pension cuts \u2026 This was never, ever on the table, and it is wrong to claim that it was, says Juncker (another attack on the Greek side). The Greek government had the ability to substitute measures, he adds. And we also pushed for structural changes to tackle vested interests, Juncker insists: It took some times, hours, to persuade the Greek government to impose a less-favourable tax regime for ship owners, even though this is common sense. Juncker adds that Greece suffers from a lack of competition, meaning that energy and commodity prices are among the highest in Europe. He says he wanted to tackle that. Juncker is arguing that the Greek side deliberately dragged out talks, leading to the current crisis: I put the talks on a more political level, as Greek authorities wished, says Juncker. We did not leave the talks to technocrats. I have done everything I can to deliver a deal, he reiterates. This is quite an attack on Alexis Tsipras from Juncker. Other European countries have been down \u201cvery difficult paths\u201d and took very difficult decisions, he says. We were doing everything we could, working day and night, he says, to get a deal before the Greeks unilaterally terminated talks by calling a referendum. Jean-Claude Juncker, who looks desperately glum, says he was \u2018deeply saddened\u2019 by the events of last Saturday. We saw egotism, tactical games, populist games, says Juncker - \u201cafter my efforts, I feel betrayed\u201d. Playing one democracy against the other 18 is not worthy of the great Greek nation, and not fair on Greece\u2019s citizens. I have done everything I could, others did everything they could, and we do not deserve the criticism aimed at us. Juncker begins by reminding us that Greece joined the European Union in the early 19980s. Brussels didn\u2019t want Plato to play in the second division then, and I don\u2019t want it to play there today. Heads-up. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, is discussing the Greek crisis now in Brussels It is being streamed live here Angela Merkel is addressing her CDU party now, and warning that \u201cIf the euro fails, Europe fails\u201d. That\u2019s a phrase she has used before in the debt crisis when the single currency has come under strain. And there\u2019s another familiar line from the chancellor -- that solidarity and reforms go together: GERMAN CHANCELLOR MERKEL SAYS EUROPE LIVES FROM THE ABILITY TO MAKE COMPROMISES GERMAN CHANCELLOR MERKEL SAYS GERMAN FINMIN SCHAEUBLE IS ALSO IN FAVOUR OF THIS APPROACH GERMAN CHANCELLOR MERKEL SAYS IF WE LOSE THE ABILITY TO MAKE COMPROMISES IN EUROPE, THEN THE CONTINENT IS LOST GERMAN CHANCELLOR MERKEL SAYS IT\u2019S ESSENTIAL WITH THE EURO THAT SOLIDARITY AND OWN EFFORTS GO TOGETHER GERMAN CHANCELLOR MERKEL SAYS EUROPE CAN DEAL WITH CRISES LIKE IN GREECE MUCH BETTER NOW THAN IN THE PAST Pensioners in Greece\u2019s second city, Thessaloniki, also queuing at their banks this morning in the hope of getting funds - but no luck: And in Athens, there are reminders of Sunday\u2019s referendum everywhere: Greek journalist Niki Kitsantonis has been told that shopper in Athens have been stocking up on basic goods, confirming what our own Helena Smith reported earlier. Looks like Greek cash machines are up and running under the new regime of capital controls: Here\u2019s the inside line on Angela Merkel\u2019s meeting with her CDU party today, from Reuters: German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a leadership meeting of her Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday that it was up to Greece to move in the reform standoff with its euro zone partners, according to participants. Merkel also told senior CDU colleagues that decisions on Greece could only be taken on a day-to-day basis given the current level of uncertainty, the participants said. A few minutes earlier, Merkel\u2019s spokesman was telling reporters that the Chancellor was prepared to talk to Alexis Tsipras again. Analysts at RBC have issued a research note, explaining why Tuesday will be a momentous day: First, the current Greek bail-out programme expires. This is important as this means the legal basis on which all potential further bail-outs were dependent expires. As the eurogroup meeting declined to prolong the current programme further that means that at the time of the proposed referendum, there is no contract in place that the Greek authorities could then accept or decline (i.e. technically, there is nothing to vote upon). Furthermore, the European side will find it difficult to then pay out any funds even if the referendum went in favour of any further bail-out. In that case, we reckon, a completely new contract would have to be drawn up that would then have to be passed by all relevant member states\u2019 parliaments. Second, the IMF payment will (most likely) be missed. It seems very unlikely that the Greek authorities can or want to pay the \u20ac1.6bn due to the IMF on 30 June. There have been extensive debates about what this technically means and whether that constitutes a default. On the IMF itself, this is not 100% clear. IMF managing director Lagarde said in a previous comment that the IMF would not apply any grace periods and would consider Greece to be in arrears straight away. Given the acrimonious deliberations and this weekend\u2019s developments this seems possible. On the other hand, the IMF could also apply a four-week grace period before declaring a state of default. If it opted to do so, this could be bridging the time until after the referendum. We actually think that this is a distinct probability. Last night, Alexis Tsipras revealed he had asked European leaders to extend Greece\u2019s bailout beyond Tuesday\u2019s deadline - until the referendum has been held. That initial request was rebuffed on Saturday, by finance ministers at the Eurogroup, so Tsipras is now going over their heads. The FT has now uploaded one of those letters, sent to Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, in which Tsipras argues that an extension will allow: a mutually beneficial agreement, to secure fiscal, financial debt sustainability, that will return Greece to growth within the eurozone. This video shows how Greek pensioners arrived at banks in the hope of accessing their money this morning, but were rebuffed. Totally understandably, they look very anxious about the situation; some must be getting tired of the constant media scrum. As one man put it when asked what he was doing: I am here to get my pension. What else would I be doing here? Looking at the bank? UK finance minister George Osborne will update MPs on the crisis later today. Harris Georgiades, Cyprus\u2019s finance minister, is telling Bloomberg TV now that he hopes Greece\u2019s capital measures will be temporary, adding: I am very concerned for the Greek people, and I still hope there can be a way out from this very difficult situation. But a former deputy governor of Cyprus\u2019s central bank, Spyros Stavrinakis, has warned that reopening the banks will be hard. Stavrinakis lived through the 2013 Cyprus crisis, in which capital controls were imposed for almost two years. He says: Once you impose capital controls, you immediately send a message that there is something wrong with the banking sector. It is very difficult to phase down and unwind capital controls, once they are imposed, Stavrinakis adds. British tourists visiting Greece can still enjoy a \u201csmooth and fun\u201d stay, claims the Greek government. It has issued a statement that reminds us that foreigners will not be hit by capital controls; in an attempt to prevent worried holidaymakers going elsewhere. Vangelis Kotsos, the president of Chania\u2019s petrol station owners, has just called for calm on the state-run TV channel, ERT 1: \u201cPanic is mounting, for example I opened at 7:30am and by 10am I had sold the amount (of gas) that I would normally sell by tomorrow afternoon. But I foresee that soon things will normalised, more reserves will be brought in.\u201d There have been scenes of panic in northern Greece where pensioners have reportedly fainted outside banks in Salonika. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Reports of panic outside banks, in supermarkets and at petrol stations are now coming through thick and fast. Pensioners, waiting outside closed banks in Salonika, collapsed when it became apparent that the lenders weren\u2019t going to open and they would not be getting their monthly allowance. An announcement may come later today: In Crete, gas stations were also forced to close after running out of petrol. Vangelis Kotsos, president of gas station owners in Chania, said around 50% of gas stations had now run dry and described scenes of chaos as nervous Greek motorists (and presumably visiting tourists) flocked to gas stations to fill up. \u201cA lot have been coming in carrying cans so they have extra reserves.\u201d I have been getting word from friends around the capital of panic in supermarkets now being stampeded by consumers worried that stocks will run out. \u201cMayhem in Carrefour Kolonaki,\u201d said one text, referring to Greece\u2019s upmarket district above Syntagma Square. Panicked buyers were snapping up everything in sight, not least staple foods such as sugar and flour. By mid-morning it has become clear that a siege mentality appears to have taken hold of Greeks following the shock announcement of the closure of banks and imposition of capital controls. The French president is now tweeting that a Greek deal is still possible... ...and insisting that the French economy is stronger than four years ago and has nothing to fear from the Greek crisis..... Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says markets are facing a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d of negative news. As well as the Greek crisis, there is Friday\u2019s terrorist atrocities in Tunisia, France and Kuwait, and another slump in Chinese markets. The IMF deadline tomorrow now looms large, whilst investors will now be looking for any possibility of an eleventh hour rescue to prevent either or both of a Greek default or exit. Meanwhile, Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks have added to the generally risk averse sentiment, with travel companies being inevitably hit. In addition, and despite a relaxation of bank reserves and a further interest rate cut, Chinese markets fell another 7%, pulling it into a technical bear market, while also implying that the Chinese authorities are keen to act extremely quickly to stem further declines. French president Francois Hollande has emerged from an emergency cabinet meeting on Greece, to announce that there is still time, just, to save a deal. Hollande said: \u201cThere are a few hours before the negotiation is definitively closed, in particular for the prolongation of the Greek aid programme. I wish, if the Greeks, if their government, so decide, that talks resume.\u201d Hollande also warned that Sunday\u2019s referendum is a choice between staying in the eurozone and taking \u201cthe risk to leave it.\u201d The market turmoil has forced Switzerland\u2019s central bank to intervene in the currency markets to weaken the Swiss franc. Thomas Jordan, head of the Swiss National Bank, revealed this morning that the SNB stepped in, to protect Switzerland being hit by the Greek crisis. He also told a financial conference in Bern that the Greek situation remained uncertain: SWISS NATIONAL BANK\u2019S JORDAN SAYS NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THINGS ARE HEADED IN GREEK SITUATION SWISS NATIONAL BANK\u2019S JORDAN SAYS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR SOLUTION TO BE FOUND FOR GREECE, THINKS NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING SWISS NATIONAL BANK\u2019S JORDAN SAYS IN THIS DIFFICULT ECONOMIC SITUATION ANY FURTHER UNCERTAINTY IS DIFFICULT SWISS NATIONAL BANK\u2019S JORDAN SAYS THE SNB HAS INTERVENED IN CURRENCY MARKET SWISS NATIONAL BANK\u2019S JORDAN SAYS HAS INTERVENED IN THE MARKET IN DIFFICULT SITUATION And this chart shows how the euro had plunged against the Swiss franc in early trading, only to bounce back as the SNB revealed it had intervened: A war of tweets appears to have broken out between Athens and Brussels this morning. This follows the European Commission\u2019s claims on Sunday that Greece had been offered a sweetened version of a cash-for-reform deal to avert bankruptcy, when prime minister Alexis Tsipras announced his shock referendum. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital. The radical leftists in power in Athens are not backing down. Denying that a better offer had ever been made, Minister of state Nikos Pappas, the Greek prime minister\u2019s closest ally, took to twitter this morning to denounce what government officials are calling the chicanery now being spun out of Brussels. \u201cLook at the \u201cnon existent\u201d ultimatum,\u201d he tweeted under a picture showing him holding a sheet of proposals from creditors. \u201cThey are asking us to say \u201cYES to everything.\u201d On Sunday EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, addressing Greek voters directly, published what he said was a sweetened version of the deal the Athens government was looking at when Tsipras made his bombshell announcement. In a tweet also released in Greek (Juncker\u2019s spokesman Margaritis Schinas is Greek), the EU chief wrote: \u201cIn the interest of transparency and for the information of the Greek people\u201d and linked to a 10-page document of budgetary and other \u201cprior actions\u201d set by the EU and IMF as conditions for releasing cash to Greece. Reminder: EC president Jean-Claude Juncker will speak about the Greek situation in two and a half hours (11.45am BST/1.45pm Athens) Shortly afterwards (and possibly clashing), Angela Merkel is due in the German parliament to discuss the crisis. She also due to hold emergency meetings today with German political party leaders, and her own CDU party. Back in Athens, pensioners have been queuing outside some bank branches - even though the system has been shut down for a week. According to the Kathimerini newspaper, \u201csome local lenders\u2019 branches were expected to open on Monday in order to services pensioners unable to use credit or cash cards to retrieve their pensions\u201d. Banks were expected to release more information regarding which branches would open their doors later in the day, Kathimerini adds. All Europe\u2019s main stock markets are deep in the red, after a nervy opening session. David Cameron explains that a Downing Street team had been preparing for months for the possibility of a Greek exit from the Euro, and said he would put the \u201cfinal touches\u201d to a plan in a meeting later today. \u201cWe must make sure we are prepared for any eventuality, that means advising British tourists, looking after British pensioners and people receiving benefits who are living in Greece as well as dealing with issues of Greek banks.\u201d The prime minister skirted around whether a Greek departure from the eurozone would make Britain\u2019s renegotiation with the European Union ahead of the UK\u2019s own \u201cin-out\u201d referendum easier. \u201cIf this organisation is going to would it has to be flexible enough to work for both Eurozone members and countries that I believer are never going to join the Euro, like Britain. My point is that this organisation needs to have the flexibility of a network not the rigidity of a block. This is a two-way street... there are lots of difficult negotiations to come but every journey starts with a single step, as they say.\u201d David Cameron has just discussed the Greek crisis on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme. Does he believe Greece should leave the euro? (the Guardian revealed on Friday that the UK PM told a fellow EU leader that it \u201cmight be better\u201d for Greece to withdraw from the eurozone) Britain\u2019s interest are best served by an agreement between Greece and the eurozone that delivers the security that we want to see, Cameron replies. Will Sunday\u2019s referendum effectively be a vote on whether to stay in the euro? I think that\u2019s what it will come down to, Cameron replies. If the Greek people vote yes, they are voting for the sort of deal put forward by the institutions.... \u201cIf they vote no, I find it hard to see how that is consistent with staying in the euro, because there would be, I think, a very significant default and a very significant problem.\u201d Cameron adds that Britain has drawn up contingency plan for Greece, and he\u2019ll put the final touches to it today. Most of the interview covered the terrorism attacks in Tunisia - my colleague Andrew Sparrow covered it in his Politics Live blog. The overall European banking index has tumbled by over 4% in the opening minutes of trading, as investors react to last weekend\u2019s drama. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Francis Yared explains that there will be short, and long-term consequences of the Greek crisis: Given market optimism towards a Greek deal over the last week, the initial risk-off move could be pronounced. Post the initial shock, the ECB\u2019s response and sticky domestic capital should limit contagion. Longer term, the events in Greece are a stark reminder that the current eurozone architecture is vulnerable to domestic politics. This in itself will justify some structural risk premium unless there is an institutional change or further economic convergence Bank shares across Europe are in retreat: 08:01:25 - SHARES IN BANCO COMERCIAL PORTUGUES DOWN 9.6 PERCENT 08:02:13 - SHARES IN BANCA POPOLARE DI SONDRIO DOWN 9.7 PERCENT 08:02:38 - FRANCE\u2019S BNP PARIBAS SHARES DOWN 7 PCT, SOCGEN DOWN 5.8 PCT, AFTER GREECE SHUTS BANKS, IMPOSES CAPITAL CONTROLS 08:02:53 - SHARES IN BANK OF IRELAND DOWN 8 PERCENT 08:04:00 - UK HSBC SHARES DOWN 2.2 PCT, BARCLAYS DOWN 4 PCT, FRANCE\u2019S CREDIT AGRICOLE DOWN 8 PCT, NATIXIS DOWN 9 PCT AFTER GREECE IMPOSES CAPITAL CONTROLS 08:04:08 - SHARES IN ERSTE GROUP BANK DOWN 6.1 PERCENT 08:04:47 - SHARES IN RAIFFEISEN DOWN 14.4 PERCENT 08:06:20 - SHARES IN COMMERZBANK DOWN 7.1 PERCENT 08:06:29 - SPAIN\u2019S BBVA SHARES DOWN 8.4 PCT, DEUTSCHE BANK DOWN 6.3 PCT, ING GROUP DOWN 5 PCT AFTER GREECE SHUTS BANKS 08:07:17 - SHARES IN BANKIA DOWN 8.4 PERCENT 08:09:07 - SPAIN\u2019S SANTANDER SHARES DOWN 8.5 PCT AFTER GREECE IMPOSES CAPITAL CONTROLS The German DAX and French CAC have both tumbled by around 4.4% at the open. And the Portuguese stock market plunged by around 5.8%, as the Greek crisis ripples through the markets. Europe\u2019s stock markets are opening... and the FTSE 100 index has promptly tumbled by 2.2%, or 147 points. France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, has admitted that Greece could leave the euro, in an interview with France Inter radio this morning. Of a euro exit for Greece, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s always a possibility, it\u2019s a risk.\u201d Sapin insisted that negotiations could resume at any time -- and added that Athens must decide: \u201cDo you want to continue the negotiations or do you want to take the risk of exiting the euro?\u201d The Economist Intelligence Unit reckons Grexit is now more likely than not: Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at German financial services firm Allianz, believes there is only a 15% chance that Greece will stay in the eurozone. He told Bloomberg this morning that Greece will probably be forced to leave the single currency in the weeks ahead, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s an 85 percent probability that Greece will be forced to leave the euro zone.\u201d \u201cWhat we are seeing here is what economists call the sudden stop, when the payment system stops. The logic of a sudden stop is a massive economic contraction, social unrest and it\u2019s going to make continued membership of the euro zone very difficult for Greece. Overnight, the Greek government released details of its capital control measures.. Here are the key points: All banks shut until 6 July All Greek banks \u2013 including branches of foreign banks \u2013 will remain closed until after the referendum on the bailout proposals. The government says they will reopen on Tuesday 7 July. ATM withdrawals limited to \u20ac60 a day Cash machine withdrawals will be capped until 6 July. Many machines are already reported to have run out of bank notes, although the government said ATMs should \u201coperate normally again by Monday noon at the latest\u201d. The \u20ac60 limit is per bank card. The limit can be changed by the finance minister. Foreign bank cards exempted from controls People using a credit or debit card issued in a foreign country will not be affected by the limits on ATM withdrawals. Thousands of foreign tourists currently staying in Greece could still be affected by cash machines running dry, however, and the finance minister could yet set withdrawal limits here too. Stock exchange closed on Monday The Athens stock exchange will not open on Monday. Bank card payments \u2018as normal\u2019 Paying by credit or debit card in shops and between Greek bank accounts should continue to work as normal. Internet banking \u2018unaffected\u2019 The government statement said online transactions inside Greece will not be affected. Foreign transfers prohibited Transfers of money to destinations outside Greece are prohibited and will require approval from a Ministry of Finance commission. Other transactions subject to approval A new banking transactions approval committee will have to approve, on a case-by-case basis, any urgent transactions deemed \u201cnecessary to safeguard a public or social interest\u201d, such as medical expenses or pharmaceutical imports. Interest surcharges prohibited Interest surcharges on due payments are prohibited during the period of closure. Penalties for banks breaching controls Banks breaching the rules face fines of up to 10% of the amount of any transaction violating the control measures. What will happen after 6 July? The statement allows for the \u201cbank holiday period\u201d to be extended \u2013 or shortened \u2013 by the finance minister. Overnight, markets from Mumbai to Tokyo were rattled by the Greek debt crisis: Good morning. The Greek debt crisis is set to sent turmoil through Europe\u2019s financial markets this morning, as the looming prospect of Greece plunging out of the eurozone sends panic through trading floors. Shares are set to tumble in London, Frankfurt, Paris and beyond, after a dramatic weekend which began with Alexis Tsipras announce a referendum on bailout terms next Sunday - and ended with the imposition of capital controls and a bank holiday for at least a week. In Greece, people are facing up to the news that banks will remain shut for at least a week - and that they will be restricted to taking out \u20ac60 per day at the cash machines. Greece crisis deepens as banks close for a week after weekend that shook euro Germany\u2019s DAX index is predicted to plunge by 5% - an alarming selloff - while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is on track to shed over 2% when trading begins at 8am BST. European government bonds could also come under pressure, if investors calculate that the eurozone debt crisis is going to spread. Asian stock markets have already been through a torrid day, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei tumbling almost 3%. And the euro has already shed around 1% against the US dollar. Here\u2019s our overnight story: Greece crisis: markets begin to tumble as investors flee Europe\u2019s political leaders are also scrambling to address the crisis, with Greece now on track to exit its bailout tomorrow night and default on its \u20ac1.6bn repayment to the International Monetary Fund. European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker is due to hold a press conference at 10.45am BST to discuss the latest developments on Greece. In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called an emergency meeting with the heads of parliamentary groups and party leaders today, while French President Francois Hollande will chair crisis talks with key ministers in Paris this morning. UK prime minister David Cameron is due to speak on the situation soon - he\u2019s due on Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme this morning (the ten past eight slot).

It has failed badly. The economy has shrunk by 26%, unemployment has risen to 27%, youth unemployment to 60% and, the debt-to-GDP ratio jumped from 120% to 180%. The economic catastrophe has led to a humanitarian crisis, with more than 3 million people on or below the poverty line. </p> <p data-dropid=\"1\">Against this background, the Greek people elected the Syriza-led government on 25 January with a clear mandate to put an end to austerity. In the ensuing negotiations, the government made it clear that the future of Greece is in the Eurozone and the EU. The lenders, however, insisted on the continuation of their failed recipe, refused to discuss a write down of the debt \u2013 which the IMF is on record as considering unviable \u2013 and finally, on 26 June, issued an ultimatum to Greece by means of a non-negotiable package that would entrench austerity. This was followed by a suspension of liquidity to the Greek banks and the imposition of capital controls. </p> <p data-dropid=\"1\">In this situation, the government has asked the Greek people to decide the future of the country in a referendum to be held next Sunday.

For now the main focus is on the impact on financial markets. The monetary policy committee has scope to watch how the Greek referendum unfolds. If it needs to act, we believe the Committee is likely to sound rhetorically dovish first and foremost. After that, it has a range of options.</p> <p data-dropid=\"2\">The most immediate asset market transmission from greater Grexit risk to the UK is likely through the currency. At the Asia open the euro/pound had already breached 0.70 before recovering. We expect the euro to continue trading heavily in the coming days and, barring a surge in general dollar demand, the Bank of England exchange rate index could break 93, dragging sterling further away from the Bank\u2019s own assumptions (at 90) and comfort levels.

As the eurogroup meeting declined to prolong the current programme further that means that at the time of the proposed referendum, there is no contract in place that the Greek authorities could then accept or decline (i.e. technically, there is nothing to vote upon). Furthermore, the European side will find it difficult to then pay out any funds even if the referendum went in favour of any further bail-out. In that case, we reckon, a completely new contract would have to be drawn up that would then have to be passed by all relevant member states\u2019 parliaments. </p> <h2>Second, the IMF payment will (most likely) be missed. </h2> <p>It seems very unlikely that the Greek authorities can or want to pay the \u20ac1.6bn due to the IMF on 30 June. There have been extensive debates about what this technically means and whether that constitutes a default. On the IMF itself, this is not 100% clear. IMF managing director Lagarde said in a previous comment that the IMF would not apply any grace periods and would consider Greece to be in arrears straight away.</p> <p>Given the acrimonious deliberations and this weekend\u2019s developments this seems possible. On the other hand, the IMF could also apply a four-week grace period before declaring a state of default. If it opted to do so, this could be bridging the time until after the referendum. We actually think that this is a distinct probability. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"595f0cbb126bccfd94ffffc68b9eeb6dc3b1750d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435572123094/df49818a-ffbd-42ba-be0f-512cc50c8fce-460x295.png\" alt=\"IMF late repayment policy\" width=\"460\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RBC</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55911401e4b024248ae9a6fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-29T09:54:11.928Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Last night, Alexis Tsipras revealed he had asked European leaders to extend Greece\u2019s bailout beyond Tuesday\u2019s deadline - until the referendum has been held.</strong></p> <p>That initial request was rebuffed on Saturday, by finance ministers at the Eurogroup, so Tsipras is now going over their heads. </p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/files/2015/06/letter_PM-Luxembourg.pdf\">The FT has now uploaded one of those letters</a>, sent to Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, in which Tsipras argues that an extension will allow:</p> <blockquote> <p data-dropid=\"3\"> a mutually beneficial agreement, to secure fiscal, financial debt sustainability, that will return Greece to growth within the eurozone.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SpiegelPeter/statuses/615443354206273536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Paragraph in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atsipras\">@atsipras</a> letter to PMs requesting (again) bailout extension.

      "bodyText": "The eurozone\u2019s three biggest countries have raised the stakes in next Sunday\u2019s Greek referendum with an orchestrated warning to voters that a no vote would mean exit from the single currency and the return of the drachma. As the Greek economy suffered on its first day of stringent capital controls, politicians from Germany, France and Italy joined the European commission in insisting that the poll was not about whether Athens could secure more favourable bailout terms but was about continued euro membership. The stark assessment was shared by George Osborne who told MPs that the UK economy would be affected by the chaos that would result from Greece leaving the eurozone. The chancellor\u2019s comments came as ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s issued a grim analysis of the repercussions that could follow an euro exit, the chances of which it has raised from 33% to 50%. S&amp;P said there could be \u201ca serious foreign currency shortage for the private and public sectors, potentially leading to the rationing of key imports such as fuel\u201d. S&amp;P added that without continuing European Central Bank support for Greek banks, the country\u2019s \u201cpayment system would shut down and its banks would not be able to operate\u201d. Eurozone leaders sought to exploit pictures of cashpoint queues and empty Athens restaurants to stress what was at stake if Greeks supported the decision of their prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to reject the fresh austerity measures being demanded by the country\u2019s creditors for continued financial support. At the end of a day that saw sharp falls in share prices around the globe, Tsipras used a TV address to ask a public still stunned by the imposition of a \u20ac60 daily limit on bank withdrawals to back his resistance to a new round of tough tax increases and spending cuts demanded by the troika of the commission, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund. Tsipras urged Greeks to vote no in the forthcoming referendum, saying the plebiscite would be a strong \u201cnegotiating tool\u201d in talks with lenders. Denying that Greece had walked away from negotiations, he told state-run TV: \u201cThe greater the number of no [votes], the greater the weapon the government will have to relaunch negotiations. Greece never left the negotiating table, it is still at the negotiating table. \u201d Appearing by turns combative and nervous, the 40-year-old leader suggested, for the first time, that he and his radical left Syriza party would resign if the yes vote triumphed in the referendum. \u201cWe will respect the result but we will not be there to serve it,\u201d he told the station. Greece\u2019s international creditors clearly did not want a no vote because they wanted to kill \u201cthe hope\u201d of enacting policies against austerity, he claimed. \u201cThey want to kill democracy in the place where it was born,\u201d he said, adding that the \u201cnegative decision\u201d to close banks was aimed squarely at thwarting Sunday\u2019s vote. \u201cGreek people have experienced more difficult moments and they will survive,\u2019 he said. With polls showing Greeks in favour of remaining inside the eurozone, the Greek government made no mention of exit from the single currency in the wording of Sunday\u2019s referendum. This will ask Greece whether they support the \u201cplan of agreement\u201d drawn up by the troika and will put the no option Tsipras wants at the top of the ballot paper. The publication of the wording coincided with Greece admitting that it would not meet the Tuesday deadline for making a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) payment to the IMF in Washington and new evidence of the parlous state of Greek banks following the referendum announcement. It emerged that the Bank of Greece asked in vain for the ECB to increase its emergency funding by \u20ac6bn in order to cover panic withdrawals. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s vice-chancellor, voiced concerns that a so-called Grexit could start to unravel six decades of closer integration. He said the crisis was the most serious faced by Europe since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. He added that if the Greeks voted no on Sunday, they were voting \u201cagainst remaining in the euro\u201d. He was supported by French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who came under strong pressure from US president Barack Obama to find a solution to the deepening crisis before it caused more damage to a still-fragile global economy. Hollande said: \u201cIt\u2019s the Greek people\u2019s right to say what they want their future to be. It\u2019s about whether the Greeks want to stay in the eurozone or take the risk of leaving.\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of the Eurogroup of finance ministers from the 19 nations using the single currency, said the door was still open for negotiations to resume despite time running out before Sunday\u2019s referendum. But the hardening stance among Greece\u2019s partners was evident from a tweet by Matteo Renzi, Italy\u2019s prime minister and hitherto seen as one of the European leaders closest to Tsipras. The referendum, Renzi said, was not a question of the commission versus Tsipras but of \u201cthe euro versus the drachma. This is the choice\u201d. Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the moment of truth ... I\u2019d like to ask the Greek people to vote yes ... No would mean that Greece is saying no to Europe.\u201d In a sign of how relations have been soured by last week\u2019s rejection of what was seen by Tsipras as a take-it-or-leave-it final offer, Juncker accused the Greek prime minister of telling lies about the proposals and said they did not include plans to cut pensions. A government spokesman in Athens accused Juncker of telling a \u201cpreposterous lie\u201d. Greece\u2019s stock market was closed but a share price fall that began in Asia spread to Europe and later the US. London\u2019s FTSE 100 lost almost 2% of its value, with drops of 3.5% in Frankfurt and 3.7% in Paris. New York\u2019s Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2%, the biggest one day decline this year, while the Nasdaq tumbled 2.4%. The euro slid to its weakest level against the pound since 2007 and now stands at almost \u20ac1.40 to the pound. Twelve months ago it was trading at \u20ac1.25. On global markets, the interest rate on Greek 10-year bonds rose by four percentage points to 15%, a sign that financial markets fear the country\u2019s days in the euro are numbered. About 850 Greek banks could open for business on Thursday in order to pay pensions, the government said. Osborne said British holidaymakers travelling to Greece should carry enough cash for the whole trip and to cover emergencies. After the chancellor held a contingency meeting with David Cameron and the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, he said he was \u201choping for the best but preparing for the worst\u201d. The chancellor said British taxpayers could be liable for hundreds of millions of pounds if Greece fell out of the eurozone and relied on an emergency loan scheme supported by the EU\u2019s budget which is funded by all 28 member states. He said that an early decision by the coalition government was to exempt the UK from eurozone bailouts, dramatically reducing the \u201cdirect exposure\u201d of the UK. But Osborne added: \u201cOf course we are part of the financial system of Europe and we will be affected if there is a Greek exit.\u201d The chancellor\u2019s remarks referred to the EU\u2019s balance of payments support system which is open to non-eurozone members of the EU. The scheme has been used in recent years to release billions of euros to Romania, Hungary and Latvia when they were hit by the global financial crash. If Greek falls out of the euro, it is expected that the IMF would become its main lender of emergency. Under the arrangements for Hungarian and Romanian, the EU balance of payments scheme provided about 40% of their loans.",

About 850 Greek banks could open for business on Thursday in order to pay pensions, the government said. </p> <p>Osborne said British holidaymakers travelling to Greece should carry enough cash for the whole trip and to cover emergencies. After the chancellor held a contingency meeting with David Cameron and the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, he said he was \u201choping for the best but preparing for the worst\u201d.</p> <p>The chancellor said British taxpayers could be liable for hundreds of millions of pounds if Greece fell out of the eurozone and relied on an emergency loan scheme supported by the EU\u2019s budget which is funded by all 28 member states.</p> <p>He said that an early decision by the coalition government was to exempt the UK from eurozone bailouts, dramatically reducing the \u201cdirect exposure\u201d of the UK. But Osborne added: \u201cOf course we are part of the financial system of Europe and we will be affected if there is a Greek exit.\u201d</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s remarks referred to the EU\u2019s balance of payments support system which is open to non-eurozone members of the EU. The scheme has been used in recent years to release billions of euros to Romania, Hungary and Latvia when they were hit by the global financial crash.</p> <p>If Greek falls out of the euro, it is expected that the IMF would become its main lender of emergency. Under the arrangements for Hungarian and Romanian, the EU balance of payments scheme provided about 40% of their loans.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tate &amp; Lyle has given its new finance director, Nick Hampton, \u00a3700,000 in shares after the company\u2019s poor performance made it unlikely he would collect the full share bonus he had expected when he joined the company. When Hampton was hired from PepsiCo in June, Tate &amp; Lyle promised to buy him out from his existing pay deal by handing him \u00a32.6m in shares, which had performance criteria attached. One portion of the two-part share award, worth up to \u00a31.4m, was linked to the company\u2019s returns to shareholders. But, as the share price has fallen since he joined, the company has now replaced those \u00a31.4m of performance-linked shares with another award of \u00a3700,000, which do not appear to be subject to performance criteria. They will pay out if he can remain in the job until 31 March 2017. The company, which no longer produces the sugar with which it has traditionally been associated, said shareholders had been consulted on the change. Hampton joined the board on 1 September 2014, just weeks before a profits warning on 23 September. The share price was 680p when he joined and then plunged to 592p after the profits warning. They currently trade at around 530p. \u201cFollowing consultation with a number of the company\u2019s largest shareholders, which indicated a broad level of support, and in keeping with our shareholder-approved policy in relation to the terms of directors\u2019 appointments, the company has agreed to make a restricted stock award to Nick with a face value of \u00a3700,000,\u201d the company said in its annual report (pdf). \u201cAs a condition of the grant of this award, Nick will be required to surrender the award that was made over \u00a31,440,000 worth of shares,\u201d the firm added. The company also disclosed that the chief executive, Javed Ahmed, had refused to accept shares he could have received through a long-term performance plan. No directors received annual bonuses because of the fall in profits to \u00a352m from \u00a3277m. Ahmed, who admitted the performance had been disappointing, received \u00a3996,000 for 2014, compared with \u00a32.7m the previous year. He said: \u201cThe group\u2019s performance for the year was significantly held back by three main factors: first, the impact of operational and supply chain issues experienced mainly in the first half of the financial year; second, the continued extremely competitive market for Sucralose; and third, the impact in the second half of the financial year of volatility and lower pricing in some of the commodity markets in which our bulk ingredients business operates.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Business secretary Sajid Javid attacks CBI over EU referendum", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The business secretary on Monday night criticised the CBI\u2019s stance over the EU referendum, overshadowing the appointment of its new boss, Carolyn Fairbairn. Sajid Javid made his intervention at a dinner of the employers\u2019 body, which has mounted a high-profile campaign to see Britain remain in the EU. The government, which is calling an in-out referendum on continued membership of the EU, wants to negotiate changes with its European partners. Javid said the CBI had been showing a commitment to remaining part of the EU even without these reforms. \u201cYou know how negotiation works. You wouldn\u2019t sit down at the start of a merger or acquisition and, like a poker player showing his hand to the table, announce exactly what terms you were prepared to accept,\u201d said Javid. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work in the boardroom and it won\u2019t work in Brussels.\u201d His remarks were reported just hours after the CBI announced that Fairbairn, a former head of strategy at the BBC and ITV, would be its new director general. Fairbairn, 54, will replace John Cridland \u2013 who has led the CBI since January 2011 \u2013 in November. She will be the first woman to lead the organisation, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. It was already clear that one of Fairbairn\u2019s main tasks will be to shape the CBI\u2019s stance for the coming EU referendum. Cridland and Sir Michael Rake, the CBI president, have supported Britain remaining in the EU but have been criticised for representing the view of big companies over smaller businesses. Ahead of Javid\u2019s speech, the CBI said Fairbairn supported its advocacy of Britain remaining in a reformed EU. The CBI\u2019s members voted eight to two in favour of the position two years ago, but some big companies, including JCB, have taken a more hostile line on membership. A CBI spokesman said: \u201cMost CBI members are clear that the EU gives us access to 500 million consumers and helps set the global trade agenda. \u201cBut reform must be an ongoing process and we support the government\u2019s push for Brussels to focus on the big ticket issues, like signing more trade deals and doing less where it doesn\u2019t add value.\u201d Rake said: \u201cCarolyn is a remarkable business leader with an impressive background as an economist, journalist, management consultant and policy strategist. Her wealth and breadth of experience will be critical in steering the CBI through choppy political and economic waters, including an EU referendum.\u201d Fairbairn began her career as an economist at the World Bank and then worked as a journalist at the Economist and as a management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Co. She was also a Downing Street policy adviser from 1995-97 when John Major was prime minister and ITV\u2019s director of strategy between 2007 and 2010. Fairbairn was on secondment from McKinsey when she worked at Downing Street. Since then she has not been a member of a political party, donated to a party or otherwise been involved with party politics, the CBI said. Having spent seven years at the BBC, where, as the director of strategy, she helped launch Freeview, Fairbairn quit in late 2004 to spend a year travelling with her partner, Peter Chittick, who is now her husband, and their children. Her decision took the BBC by surprise when the broadcaster was in the middle of a tough charter review process. Chittick had just cashed in on the \u00a366m sale of the Hotel du Vin chain he helped launch 10 years earlier. Fairbairn was also a non-executive director at the Financial Services Authority for three years from 2008 and worked on the FSA\u2019s separation into two regulators. The CBI, which is the UK\u2019s main business lobby group, said she was chosen from an initial list of 46 candidates that was whittled down to a shortlist of six. Cridland was a CBI veteran when he became director general but the organisation has opted for an outsider in Fairbairn. Katja Hall, the CBI\u2019s deputy director general, was thought to be a strong candidate for the job. Fairbairn will also have to steer the CBI\u2019s response to a further round of spending cuts planned by the chancellor, George Osborne. Cridland has broadly supported austerity measures, though the CBI has called for more infrastructure investment to support growth. She said: \u201cThe debate around Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU and the productivity challenge facing our economy will be two of the defining issues of the next few years, and I greatly look forward to representing the voice of British businesses of all sizes on these questions and many others.\u201d Fairbairn is a non-executive director at the outsourcing company Capita, Lloyds Banking Group, the manufacturer Vitec, the Competition and Markets Authority and the UK Statistics Authority. She will stand down from these posts before taking up her job at the CBI. The government has tried to encourage greater numbers of women at the top of business and economic life by setting targets for female representation on boards of directors. Frances O\u2019Grady became the first female general secretary of the Trades Union Congress when she was elected in January 2013.",

At their 45-minute meeting, the three reportedly discuss the possibility of extending Greece\u2019s bailout programme. The Greek government issues a statement after the talks saying its side does not understand why creditors are insisting on such hard measures. Merkel says: \u201cWe have taken a step towards Greece \u2026 Now it is up to the Greek side to take a similar step.\u201d</p> <h2>10am</h2> <h2>Greek bank deposits hit 11-year low</h2> <p>Data from the European Central Bank shows people have been rushing to withdraw money from Greek banks.

The funds would include the \u20ac7.2bn Greece is owed from its current bailout package and \u20ac1.8bn from the ECB for profits it has made from Greek bonds.</p> <h2>1.30pm</h2> <h2>Eurozone sources say differences narrowing</h2> <p>Briefly, it looks like a cash-for-reforms deal could be within grasp. Eurozone sources tell the Guardian that differences are now minimal; that the pension issue is resolved, as are lots of VAT issues and that the differences on VAT amount to a risible \u20ac107m.

AS Tsipras prepares to leave Brussels for Athens, the Greek cabinet is asked to be on standby for an emergency meeting later that evening. </p> <h2>4.30pm</h2> <h2>Eurozone officials still hopeful of weekend deal</h2> <p>While Greek officials say nothing has been agreed to, a senior EU official tells the news agency Reuters that hopes of a deal with Greece on Saturday are higher than 50%. </p> <p>Varoufakis also sounds an upbeat note. \u201cI see no reason why we cannot have a deal,\u201d he tells <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/places/greece\">Greece</a>\u2019s Antenna TV from Brussels. But he also expresses frustration at creditors\u2019 stance, adding: \u201cUnfortunately, every time we make a concession and we get three quarters of the way, the institutions do the exact opposite, they toughen their stance.\u201d</p> <h2>6.30pm</h2> <h2>Protestors take to Athens streets</h2> <p>Communist party supporters start to pour into Syntagma square in Athens to protest against the creditors\u2019 demands for more austerity. Their rallying cry is: \u201cNo to the new agreement, rupture with lenders.\u201d</p> <h2>7.15pm</h2> <h2>Ministers set to draw up plans to contain crisis</h2> <p>News emerges that Eurogroup ministers will use some of their time together on Saturday to draw up plans for emergency measures to ringfence Greece\u2019s financial system unless <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras\">Tsipras</a> accepts creditors\u2019 terms for a five-month extension of the bailout.<br></p> <h2>11pm</h2> <h2>Tsipras calls referendum</h2> <p>After an emergency meeting of his cabinet, Tsipras says the government has decided that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/greece-calls-referendum-on-bailout-terms-offered-by-creditors\">package of austerity measures proposed by creditors will be put to a popular vote</a>. The referendum will take place on Sunday 5 July. In a national address, Tsipras says: \u201cAfter five months of hard negotiations, our partners, unfortunately, ended up making a proposal that was an ultimatum towards Greek democracy and the Greek people.\u201d</p> <h2>Saturday 27 June</h2> <h2>Greek parliament votes on referendum, Eurogroup reconvenes</h2> <p>Greek politicians head to parliament to vote on whether to back Tsipras\u2019s plan for a referendum. At the same time, eurozone finance ministers make their way to Brussels for another Eurogroup meeting.</p> <p>Meanwhile, queues start forming at Greek cash machines as people worry about capital controls being imposed, whereby banks close and limits are placed on ATM withdrawals.</p> <h2>11.25am</h2> <h2>Greek parliament debate begins</h2> <p>In Athens, MPs begin their debate ahead of a vote on whether to hold a referendum. Greece\u2019s interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, opens the debate by criticising the country\u2019s lenders, calling on all parties to back the referendum and confirming that Syriza will vote no to the proposed austerity measures.</p> <p>But the debate gets increasingly heated and the former deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos questions whether a referendum is constitutional.</p> <h2>12.30pm</h2> <h2>Bailout extension in doubt</h2> <p>Reports coming out of Brussels suggest Eurogroup ministers are unlikely to offer Greece an extension because several countries oppose such a move.</p> <h2>1pm</h2> <h2>Eurogroup meeting</h2> <p>The meeting of eurozone finances ministers is due to get under way. Greece will ask the Eurogroup to extend their bailout programme by a few days, beyond 30 June, to accommodate the referendum. But there is no guarantee that this will be granted. And if Greece is no longer in a bailout programme, it is harder for the ECB to keep providing emergency funds.</p> <h2>1.20pm</h2> <h2>Finland says plan B is becoming plan A for Greece</h2> <p>Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb arrives at Eurogroup and tells reporters that the referendum means we are \u201cclosing the door\u201d on future negotiations. \u201cI think there is a clear majority-cum-consensus inside the eurogroup that an extension of the programme is out of the question,\u201d he says. \u201cI would argue that plan B is becoming plan A.\u201d</p> <p>Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, arrives, and tells reporters that there appears to be no basis for further talks with Greece.</p> <h2>2pm<br>Greece wants bailout extension of a \u2018few weeks\u2019</h2> <p>Varoufakis says he will ask fellow Eurogroup ministers for a bailout extension of \u201ca few weeks\u201d to accommodate the referendum.</p> <h2><strong>4pm </strong></h2> <p>Greece\u2019s request for an extension has been turned down, says the news agency Agence France-Presse. Minutes later, reports emerge that Greece\u2019s delegation is leaving the Eurogroup meeting and talks will continue among the remaining 18 countries.</p> <h2>4.30pm</h2> <h2>Dijsselbloem: Greek programme will expire on Tuesday night</h2> <p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup, tells a press conference in Brussels that talks were still continuing between Greece and the creditors on Friday night when the Greek delegation suddenly had to leave the room. The proposals were not concluded, but yet the Greek government had rejected them and put them to the Greek people, he says. As a result, the Greek bailout programme will not be extended and will expire on Tuesday night, he confirms.</p> <h2>5pm</h2> <h2>Varoufakis: We could not accept creditors\u2019 proposals</h2> <p>Varoufakis holds his own press conference in Brussels and says Greece couldn\u2019t accept the recessionary consequences of the proposals from its lenders.<strong> </strong>Nor did the government have the mandate to reject them \u2013 only the Greek people could decide, he adds. <br></p> <p>He denies that the 5 July referendum will be about eurozone membership. He also says a deal can still be reached by Tuesday, and that the Greek government could even support it if creditors offered better terms.</p> <h2>6.40pm</h2> <h2>France\u2019s Sapin: We want Greece to stay in the euro</h2> <p>The remaining 18 finance minister end their meeting. The French finance minister, Michel Sapin, tells reporters France is ready to restart talks at any time with Greece and that nobody wants Greece to leave the euro. He criticises the decision to call a referendum.</p> <h2>6.45pm<br>Tense phone call</h2> <p>Details emerge of a phone call during the afternoon between Tsipras, Merkel and Hollande. Tsipras rejects Merkel\u2019s protestations that the referendum will boil down to a choice \u201cbetween the euro and drachma\u201d and counters that Greece will not be told what question to ask in the referendum.</p> <h2>7.40pm<br>Eurogroup says it stands ready to support Greece</h2> <p>Dijsselbloem tells a news conference the 18 eurozone finance ministers without Greece discussed \u201cour strong determination to ensure the strength of our monetary union\u201d. He says the group will use all the instruments at its disposal to ensure financial stability, alongside the ECB. \u201cThe Eurogroup still consists of 19 members and we stand ready to support Greece if and when required, after the bailout programme expires.\u201d</p> <h2>8pm<br>Germany predicts \u2018difficult situation\u2019 in Greece</h2> <p>Sch\u00e4uble tells a press conference that Greece is likely to get into a difficult situation in the days ahead, but Saturday\u2019s decisions don\u2019t mean Greece is leaving the eurozone.</p> <h2>8.10pm</h2> <h2>Greece \u2018must take measures to ensure stability\u2019</h2> <p>The European Council issues an official statement after meeting of the other 18 finance ministers, saying Athens must take measures to ensure financial stability once its bailout ends.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>Sunday 28 June 2015</h2> <h2>1am <br>Greek government wins referendum vote</h2> <p>The count is in and a majority of MPs have voted in favour of holding a referendum on Greece\u2019s bailout terms on Sunday 5 July. The government easily passes the 151-vote threshold needed to authorise the referendum, with deputies from the far-right Golden Dawn voting with the government and pro-European opposition parties New Democracy, Pasok and To Potami and the KKE Communist party voting against.</p> <h2>11.30am</h2> <h2><strong>UK Treasury says it is preparing for \u2018all </strong>eventualities\u2019</h2> <p>A spokesperson for HM Treasury says: \u201cWe urge the people of Greece to resolve the current uncertainty, and ensure economic and financial stability across Europe.

In a statement, the ECB says it has decided to maintain the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) ceiling at Friday\u2019s limit (that\u2019s \u20ac89bn).</p> <h2>4.30pm</h2> <h2>Lagarde: IMF stands ready to help</h2> <p>Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, reiterates that the fund believes Greece\u2019s debt sustainability needs to be addressed \u2013 code for saying that the eurozone must put up more money.

We look back over the events of the last three days. Friday 26 June 2015 Early hours The backdrop Greece and its creditors have been locked in talks for the last five months and need to agree on reforms so that the latest chunk of bailout money due to Athens can be released in time for a big debt repayment. Two deadlines loom on Tuesday: a \u20ac1.6bn repayment from Greece to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the expiry of Greece\u2019s international bailout package.

Greece\u2019s interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, opens the debate by criticising the country\u2019s lenders, calling on all parties to back the referendum and confirming that Syriza will vote no to the proposed austerity measures.

Minutes later, reports emerge that Greece\u2019s delegation is leaving the Eurogroup meeting and talks will continue among the remaining 18 countries. 4.30pm Dijsselbloem: Greek programme will expire on Tuesday night Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup, tells a press conference in Brussels that talks were still continuing between Greece and the creditors on Friday night when the Greek delegation suddenly had to leave the room. The proposals were not concluded, but yet the Greek government had rejected them and put them to the Greek people, he says. As a result, the Greek bailout programme will not be extended and will expire on Tuesday night, he confirms. 5pm Varoufakis: We could not accept creditors\u2019 proposals Varoufakis holds his own press conference in Brussels and says Greece couldn\u2019t accept the recessionary consequences of the proposals from its lenders. Nor did the government have the mandate to reject them \u2013 only the Greek people could decide, he adds. He denies that the 5 July referendum will be about eurozone membership. He also says a deal can still be reached by Tuesday, and that the Greek government could even support it if creditors offered better terms. 6.40pm France\u2019s Sapin: We want Greece to stay in the euro The remaining 18 finance minister end their meeting. The French finance minister, Michel Sapin, tells reporters France is ready to restart talks at any time with Greece and that nobody wants Greece to leave the euro.

Sunday 28 June 2015 1am Greek government wins referendum vote The count is in and a majority of MPs have voted in favour of holding a referendum on Greece\u2019s bailout terms on Sunday 5 July. The government easily passes the 151-vote threshold needed to authorise the referendum, with deputies from the far-right Golden Dawn voting with the government and pro-European opposition parties New Democracy, Pasok and To Potami and the KKE Communist party voting against. 11.30am UK Treasury says it is preparing for \u2018all eventualities\u2019 A spokesperson for HM Treasury says: \u201cWe urge the people of Greece to resolve the current uncertainty, and ensure economic and financial stability across Europe. We have taken measures to increase our economic security so we can deal with risks like this from abroad, and we continue to take steps to prepare and protect ourselves from all eventualities.\u201d 1.40pm ECB maintains emergency funding level but does not raise it The European Central Bank decides to maintain the emergency liquidity support on offer to Greece, but it has not provided any extra help to cover the funds that have flowed out of Greek banks over the weekend. In a statement, the ECB says it has decided to maintain the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) ceiling at Friday\u2019s limit (that\u2019s \u20ac89bn). 4.30pm Lagarde: IMF stands ready to help Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, reiterates that the fund believes Greece\u2019s debt sustainability needs to be addressed \u2013 code for saying that the eurozone must put up more money. And the fund is still prepared to work with both sides. In a statement, she says: \u201cI continue to believe that a balanced approach is required to help restore economic stability and growth in Greece, with appropriate structural and fiscal reforms supported by appropriate financing and debt sustainability measures.\u201d 5.20pm UK government warns tourists of cash shortages The British government updates its advice to people travelling to Greece to include a warning that cash machines might run short of funds with little warning. 6pm Greek bank closures expected Greek banks will not open on Monday, according to the head of Greece\u2019s Piraeus Bank. But Varoufakis says the Greek government opposes such moves. 6.10pm Greek stock market to stay closed The Athens stock market will not open on Monday morning either, Reuters reports. 7pm Tsipras announces capital controls and bank holiday It\u2019s official: capital controls are being imposed in Greece. Speaking on live TV, Tsipras says the Greek central bank has been forced to recommend a bank holiday and the introduction of capital controls. Greeks will be restricted to taking out just \u20ac60 a day for the next week, and banks will not reopen until 7 July \u2013 two days after the referendum. 8pm Euro tumbles as markets open The euro plunges at the start of trading in Asia, as the financial markets finally get an opportunity to react to the last 48 hours. 9.40pm White House confirms president waded in The White House confirms that Barack Obama called Merkel on Sunday and they agreed that Greece needs to find its way back to a path of reform without leaving the eurozone. Monday 29 June 8am Stock markets slump Share prices slump across Europe as Greece shuts its banks for a week. In London, the FTSE 100 tumbles by 150 points \u2013 more than 2% \u2013 when trading begins at 8am. There are even sharper falls across Europe, with the French and German markets both dropping by 4%. European banking shares are the hardest hit, suffering losses of up to 10%. Overnight in Tokyo the Nikkei index fell almost 3% and in Hong Kong shares slid 2.5%. The Athens stock exchange remains closed. 11.45am Angela Merkel: \u2018If the euro fails, Europe fails\u2019 The German chancellor tells her CDU party that solidarity and reforms go together. 11.45am Juncker\u2019s plea for a Greek yes vote Juncker makes a remarkable intervention; a seemingly desperate, last-gasp attempt to prevent Greece leaving the eurozone. He effectively tells the Greek people that they are choosing between the euro and the exit door on Sunday, that their government has lied to them, and that he has been their friend and ally at the negotiating table. Next steps Tuesday 30 June 11pm Debt repayments Greece managed to put off big payments due to the IMF this month by bundling them together. But time runs out at 11pm BST, when June\u2019s grand total of \u20ac1.6bn is due. Greece does not have the money to cover the payment, and that may well mean it is defaulting on its debt. But the IMF might conceivably agree to a grace period to tide everyone over to Sunday\u2019s referendum. 11pm Bailout expires The bailout agreement between Greece and the eurozone that was extended back in March finally expires at midnight Brussels time. The expiry cuts off access to \u20ac7.2bn of money left in the rescue package, cash Greece had wanted handed over to cover wage payments to its public sector workers, pensions and money due to the IMF. Once this deal expires, Greece will likely have to negotiate a new rescue deal from scratch to get any more eurozone bailout money. Wednesday 1 July ECB debates further support The European Central Bank, which has been providing drip-feed support to Greece\u2019s ravaged banks, will discuss whether to increase emergency funding. The ECB had this weekend declined to raise the support but its governing council will use a scheduled meeting on Wednesday to debate whether it will do more to help Greek banks after nervous customers have drained money out of their accounts. Confirming the matter was on Wednesday\u2019s agenda, ECB council member Ewald Nowotny said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to anticipate this... Now the ball is in Greece\u2019s court.\u201d Sunday 5 July \u2018Greferendum\u2019 Greeks go to the polls to vote on whether or not to accept the last proposal from its lenders. The vote, dubbed a Greferendum, is expected to cost cash-strapped Greece \u20ac110m but Greek prime minister said he had to put the latest package of austerity measures to a popular vote given they amounted to \u201can ultimatum towards Greek democracy and the Greek people\u201d. Other eurozone leaders have lined up to tell Greeks the referendum is really a choice between the euro and the drachma. EC president Jean-Claude Juncker remarked that the \u201cwhole planet will see a \u2018no\u2019 vote as meaning Greece wants out of [the] eurozone\u201d. Monday 6 July Banks - open or shut? Greek banks are due to re-open after being closed for a week following Tsipras\u2019s call for a referendum and the ECB\u2019s move to cap emergency funding to Greek banks. Capital controls involved restrictions on bank transfers overseas and a cash withdrawal limit of \u20ac60 per day per account for individuals. * All times approximate, BST",

Outside, a couple of pensioners sat at the tables on the pavement, but neither had ordered a thing. \u201cWe had fewer customers today than at the weekend and at the weekend, we had fewer than normal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting the problem to get worse as the days go by.\u201d The minnows of the Greek economy \u2013 the small shopkeepers, the bar and restaurant owners \u2013 face a double squeeze as the flow of cash dries up. Yannis Nikolorakis, an optician and the head of the retailers\u2019 association in Marousi, further north, told the privately owned Mega television channel that wholesalers were asking for payment up front before they released goods. But, for the moment at least, anyone selling essentials is doing a roaring trade. At a supermarket on Patission Street, an employee said staff had arrived to find about 50 people gathered outside waiting for the doors to open. The supermarket is part of the AB Vassilopoulos chain. Dimitris Printzios, a spokesman for the company, said: \u201cOn Monday, we have seen an increase in customer visits of around 20 to 30% and an equivalent increase of [purchases].\u201d He said sales of milk, baby food, rice, pasta, flour, oil and meat had been particularly high. There had also been an increase in the use of cards in place of cash, \u201cbut nothing major yet\u201d. One side-effect of the clampdown ordered on Sunday night has been to halt remittances by foreign workers in Greece. Mohammed Ripon from Bangladesh, who runs a electronic equipment shop that also has a money transfer point, said: \u201cWe have been told that today we cannot transfer any money. Tomorrow, we don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been given no information.\u201d Efi, behind the counter of a cafe on Voulis Street, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t really believe it, any of us. It\u2019s like a bad dream that you can\u2019t wake up from. I don\u2019t know what else to say. It\u2019s awful.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Italy\u2019s finance minister has sought to reassure Italians that they would not be following in Greece\u2019s footsteps, saying that the European Central Bank (ECB) would stop any contagion in its tracks. \u201cLet me remind you that we are not in 2011 anymore,\u201d said Pier Carlo Padoan, in an interview on Monday in Corriere della Sera, Italy\u2019s largest daily newspaper. Compared with the height of the eurozone crisis four years ago, Padoan added: \u201cToday the [European] institutions are stronger and so is our economy.\u201d It was a message of reassurance intended as much for nervous Italians watching the Greek economic crisis spiral out of control \u2013 the images of Greeks queuing in front of banks blanketed Italian newspapers and television \u2013 as it was for investors, whose confidence in Italy is critical to its stability. The scenes in Greece are especially threatening in Italy, which has only just begun to see signs of growth in its economy after six years of stagnation and recession. \u201cThe situation today is totally different than it was three years ago. We still, of course, have a huge public debt, but it is sustainable,\u201d said Antonio Villafranca, a senior research fellow at the ISPI thinktank in Milan, pointing to the \u201crelatively low\u201d spread between Italian and German government bonds. That means that the cost of borrowing money for Italy is relatively close to the cost of borrowing for Germany, the strongest economy in the eurozone: an indicator that investors feel secure the Italian debts will be repaid. While Italy could expect to see an increase in that spread \u2013 meaning some lose confidence \u2013 and market volatility in the event of Grexit, Villafranca added that the stability of the Italian government, the relative strength of Italian industry, as well as the governance of the eurozone, mean that Italy is in a far stronger position to withstand any shock. The Italian government\u2019s insistence that the country would not follow in Greece\u2019s path \u2013 despite the fact that both share high levels of debt \u2013 is mostly centred on its faith that the ECB and its Italian president, Mario Draghi, would use every instrument at its disposal if the euro was at stake in the event of an Italian crisis. The cold calculation that gives Italians peace of mind is that, while Greece may be dispensable in the eurozone, Italy is not. But even if Italy\u2019s financial fate is not seen as hinging on a possible Greek exit from the euro, the situation could have a marked impact on Italian politics. Matteo Renzi, Italy\u2019s prime minister, has kept a low profile during the tortuous negotiations between European leaders and Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister who surprised all the parties when he announced late last week that he was calling a referendum on the austerity cuts included in an emergency aid package for Greece. On Monday, Renzi said in a tweet that the referendum ought not to be seen as a personal battle between Tsipras and the EU, but one over the future of the euro in Greece. Opposition to the euro and support for Tsipras has strengthened among Renzi\u2019s political opponents, particularly the Five Star Movement (M5S), an anti-establishment and populist party that has gained momentum recently. The anti-euro sentiment has grown as Renzi\u2019s popularity has slumped and as he faces pressure on a number of other fronts, including criticism from the leftwing of his party to roll back planned structural reforms. The EU\u2019s failure to agree on a mandatory quota system to accept migrants and refugees from Africa, who are landing by the thousands on Italy\u2019s shore, has also exposed the prime minister\u2019s weak hand in international negotiations. \u201cThe only route to emancipation from the chains of the euro and of austerity is to say no to what the creditors want to impose,\u201d said senior M5S lawmakers in a statement on the party\u2019s blog on Monday. \u201cThe people of Greece have no other choice.\u201d Beppe Grillo, the former comedian and head of the M5S, regularly skewersthe European troika \u2013 the ECB, European commission, and International Monetary Fund \u2013 which he blames for destroying the Greek health system, cutting life expectancy, and increasing the number of suicides. On Monday, Grillo retweeted a tweet sent by the leader of Ukip, Nigel Farage, saying he hoped that the Greek people would \u201ccall Mr Juncker\u2019s bluff\u201d, referring to the president of the European commission. The M5S also took a swipe at Renzi on Monday, saying: \u201cThe Syriza government has maintained a constant and dignified stand, opening up new diplomatic channels ... it has not given in to the everyday blackmail that our prime minister, elected by nobody, submits to on a daily basis.\u201d It was a reference to the fact that Renzi became prime minister in 2014 after a coup within the party, not a parliamentary election. Renzi\u2019s other political opponent, Matteo Salvini, the head of the rightwing Northern League, has said he disagreed with some of Tsipras\u2019s tactics, but has cheered the Greek leader\u2019s unyielding stance. While Grillo and Salvini\u2019s anti-euro positions may be popular with Italian voters who blame the country\u2019s moribund economy on its decision to join the euro, it is far from certain whether the events in Greece will bolster or harm their cause. Some argue that Renzi could seize on the image of Greek chaos to argue that Italy is better off. \u201cClearly the scenes of people queing up the banks and fuel stations potentially undermines the points of the Northern League and the Five Star Movement,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence. \u201cBut I think there is also a feeling that if Italy would leave the euro, then Italy could do it much better than how Greece has done.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Raising interest rates too soon from their record low to head off inflation could be a self-defeating move that tips the UK back into recession, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane is to warn. Haldane will use a speech on Tuesday to caution his fellow rate-setters at the Bank against rushing to tighten borrowing costs after some policymakers in recent months have expressed fears that the return to wage growth will push up inflation. \u201cA policy of early lift-off could be self-defeating. It would risk generating the very recession today it was seeking to insure against tomorrow,\u201d Haldane will tell the Open University, according to a text of his speech released by the Bank. \u201cTrying too hard to unstick interest rates, or doing so too quickly ... runs the risk of making a difficult situation worse.\u201d With inflation currently low and confidence fragile, the next move in rates is as likely to be a cut as a rise, according to Haldane. The Bank\u2019s chief economist will highlight the cautiousness of consumers hurt by the downturn and the potential drag on growth from the strength of the pound, which has hurt UK exports.. \u201cThe current level of interest rates remains, in my view, appropriate to assure the ongoing recovery and to insure against potential downside risks to demand and inflation. Looking ahead, I have no bias on either the size or direction of future interest rate moves,\u201d Haldane will say. That view puts Haldane at odds with Bank governor Mark Carney who said earlier this year it would be \u201cextremely foolish\u201d to cut rates now. The governor has instead sought to guide markets that when interest rates do rise they will do so only gradually, having been at a historic low of 0.5% for more than six years. With inflation well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target, at just 0.1%, and the economic outlook clouded by the eurozone\u2019s renewed crisis over Greece\u2019s debts, traders are not expecting policymakers to raise interest rates for another 10 months or so. Haldane is to emphasise in his speech the balancing act the Bank\u2019s nine-strong policy committee faces. \u201cThere is clearly a tightrope to walk here: lean too much in an expansionary direction and the inflationary cat is let out of the bag ... lean too much in a contractionary direction and the recessionary gorilla is unleashed\u201d. Haldane warns that the downward effects from a stronger pound could outweigh the effects of pay growth on inflation. This month, sterling hit a seven month high against the dollar. He also needs more evidence of pay growth picking up before worrying about inflation in the wider economy. \u201cOne swallow does not a summer make ... Wage growth is causing some fluttering, but not in this dovecote,\u201d he says. Referring to the latest figures showing average pay was up 2.7% on an annual basis, he says: \u201cThis pick-up in wage growth is welcome. Indeed, this rise is a necessary ingredient for getting inflation back to target in the period ahead. \u201cIt is important also, however, to place this wage news in context. This most recent upside surprise comes against a backdrop of wage growth having surprised to the downside for much of the past two years. Up until last month, wages had surprised to the downside in 11 of the past 18 months.\u201d Haldane\u2019s speech, entitled Stuck, after a book about a kite lodged in a tree by children\u2019s illustrator and writer Oliver Jeffers, explores the wider phenomenon of interest rates in the major economies. He turns to US history to emphasise his fears about moves to tighten policy too soon only to then be forced to correct course. \u201cThe most celebrated (if that is the right word) was the Fed\u2019s tightening in 1937. This is felt by many to have sent the US economy back into recession. Almost 80 years on, the scars from that experience have yet to fade,\u201d he will say.",

The governor has instead sought to guide markets that when interest rates do rise they will do so only gradually, having been at a historic low of 0.5% for more than six years.</p> <p>With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/16/inflation-returns-to-uk-as-airline-tickets-and-petrol-prices-rise\">inflation well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target, at just 0.1%</a>, and the economic outlook clouded by the eurozone\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/stock-markets-dive-as-deepening-greece-crisis-shakes-euro\">renewed crisis over Greece\u2019s debts</a>, traders are not expecting policymakers to raise interest rates for another 10 months or so.</p> <p>Haldane is to emphasise in his speech the balancing act the Bank\u2019s nine-strong policy committee faces.</p> <p>\u201cThere is clearly a tightrope to walk here: lean too much in an expansionary direction and the inflationary cat is let out of the bag ... lean too much in a contractionary direction and the recessionary gorilla is unleashed\u201d.</p> <p>Haldane warns that the downward effects from a stronger pound could outweigh the effects of pay growth on inflation. This month, sterling hit a seven month high against the dollar.</p> <p>He also needs more evidence of pay growth picking up before worrying about inflation in the wider economy. \u201cOne swallow does not a summer make ... Wage growth is causing some fluttering, but not in this dovecote,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Referring to the latest figures showing average pay was up 2.7% on an annual basis, he says: \u201cThis pick-up in wage growth is welcome. Indeed, this rise is a necessary ingredient for getting inflation back to target in the period ahead.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important also, however, to place this wage news in context. This most recent upside surprise comes against a backdrop of wage growth having surprised to the downside for much of the past two years. Up until last month, wages had surprised to the downside in 11 of the past 18 months.\u201d</p> <p>Haldane\u2019s speech, entitled Stuck, after a book about a kite lodged in a tree by children\u2019s illustrator and writer Oliver Jeffers, explores the wider phenomenon of interest rates in the major economies. He turns to US history to emphasise his fears about moves to tighten policy too soon only to then be forced to correct course.</p> <p>\u201cThe most celebrated (if that is the right word) was the Fed\u2019s tightening in 1937. This is felt by many to have sent the US economy back into recession. Almost 80 years on, the scars from that experience have yet to fade,\u201d he will say.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Share prices have slumped across Europe as Greece shuttered its banks and severely limited cash withdrawals ahead of a referendum on 5 July. The Greek government decided on Sunday night it had no option but to order the country\u2019s banks to remain shut on Monday after the European Central Bank (ECB) froze the liquidity lifeline that has kept them afloat during a six-month run on deposits. The Greek financial stability council recommended banks remain shut until next Tuesday. As the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said next Sunday\u2019s vote on whether to accept previous bailout conditions was in effect a decision on whether to stay in the euro, fears of fallout across the continent sent markets tumbling. In London, the FTSE 100 lost 150 points \u2013 more than 2% \u2013 when trading began at 8am BST. There were even sharper falls across Europe, with the French and German markets both falling by 4%. European banking shares were the hardest hit, suffering losses of up to 10%. Overnight in Tokyo, the Nikkei index had fallen almost 3% while in Hong Kong shares slid 2.5%. The euro fell to its lowest level against the pound in seven and a half years, hitting 0.69855 pence. Oil was also hit, falling by more than a dollar to $62.10 a barrel for Brent crude. But gold, a traditional safe haven in times of trouble, rose by 0.7% to $1,183. In an emotional appeal aimed directly at the Greek people the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, urged a \u201cyes\u201d vote next weekend to what he described as a fair proposal \u2013 \u201cnot stupid austerity\u201d. \u201cIf they vote yes it will mean that Greece wants to stay with other members of the eurozone,\u201d Junker said. Using his most heated rhetoric to date in a 45-minute press briefing largely devoted to defending his record in negotiations with Athens, he said: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t commit suicide because you are afraid of death.\u201d Juncker said he felt \u201ca little betrayed\u201d and accused the Greek government of lying about the proposal on the table. \u201cWe really moved mountains until the last minute when the Greek authorities closed the door.\u201d Some analysts criticised the inflammatory tone, saying it would not help. \u201cJuncker was clearly panic-stricken throughout the press conference because Tsipras has not only wrong-footed them but outmanoeuvred them,\u201d said Alexis Mantheakis, former spokesman of Greece\u2019s rightwing LAOS party. Recriminations were also flying over the prospect of debt relief for Greece. Juncker insisted an offer of debt relief was on the table, but an EU official clarified this was a question for a future bailout package. A close adviser to Tsipras accused the commission of offering nothing new. On Sunday, the commission took the unusual step of releasing the draft bailout agreement that creditors had been negotiating with Greece before talks broke down. The 10-page document does not mention debt relief. \u201cWe are some centimetres away from an agreement,\u201d tweeted Pierre Moscovici, France\u2019s European commissioner, adding that there was an open door to further talks. \u201cWe must find a compromise. I want a reformed Greece to stay in the eurozone without austerity.\u201d Merkel stuck to a more cautious script. She is ready to talk to Tsipras again, according to her spokesman, but thinks it is up to Athens to make the next move. David Cameron said Downing Street had been preparing for months for the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro, adding that he would put the \u201cfinal touches\u201d to a plan in a meeting later on Monday. The prime minister was due to discuss the Greek crisis on Monday afternoon with the chancellor, George Osborne, and the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme if the Greek referendum this week effectively amounted to an \u201cin/out\u201d vote on the euro, the prime minister said: \u201cI think that\u2019s what the referendum will come down to. If it\u2019s a no vote I find it hard to see how that is consistent with staying in the euro.\u201d In a brief, televised address to the nation on Sunday night, Tsipras blamed the eurozone leaders. He did not say how long the banks would remain shut, nor did he give details of how much individuals and companies would be allowed to withdraw once they reopened. In the early hours of Monday morning, Tsipras published a decree in the official government gazette setting out the capital controls to be imposed. The decree \u2013 entitled \u201cBank Holiday break\u201d \u2013 was signed by Tsipras and the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos. It said all banks would be kept shut until after the referendum on 5 July and that withdrawals from cash machines would be limited to \u20ac60 \u2013 about \u00a340. Foreign transfers out of Greece are prohibited, although online transactions between Greek bank accounts are to continue as normal. Tsipras insisted that pensions and wages would be unaffected by the controls. Greece\u2019s finance ministry later announced that the strict ATM withdrawal limits would not apply to holders of credit or debit cards issued in foreign countries. This was viewed as a necessary move as tourists were spotted joining locals in front of ATMs on Sunday. Any similar restriction would hurt tourism, Greece\u2019s sole thriving industry, which accounts for at least a fifth of economic activity. Tsipras said Saturday\u2019s move by the eurozone\u2019s finance chiefs to halt Greece\u2019s bailout programme was unprecedented. He called it \u201ca denial of the Greek public\u2019s right to reach a democratic decision\u201d. The European commission said on Monday that Greece\u2019s capital controls were \u201cnecessary and proportionate\u201d, but free movement of capital would need to be reinstated \u201cas soon as possible in the interests of the Greek economy, the eurozone and the European Union\u2019s single market as a whole\u201d. Tsipras added that the finance ministers\u2019 initiative had prompted the ECB to curb its assistance, forcing the government\u2019s hand. The Greek prime minister, who has always insisted the crisis can only be solved at the highest political levels, said he had once again appealed for an extension of the bailout until after the referendum, sending his proposal to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, the leaders of the other 18 member states of the single currency, the commission and the ECB. These leaders were the only ones, he said, who could overturn the decision of finance ministers taken on Saturday and enable the ECB to restore liquidity to banks. As fears spread on Sunday that capital controls would need to be put in place, growing numbers of depositors lined up at ATMs, even in affluent city areas, to withdraw what cash they could. Drivers also flocked to petrol stations across Greece, prompting the country\u2019s largest refiner to reassure motorists that there were enough reserves. Refiner Hellenic Petroleum said: \u201cWe maintain fuel reserves for several months. The supply of our refineries with crude oil is also assured.\u201d Greece\u2019s plight deteriorated sharply on Friday night when Tsipras put his country\u2019s future in the balance by suddenly calling a referendum and arguing robustly for a rejection of the price set by his creditors for the lifeline, at least for a few more months. The vote on Sunday will ask Greeks whether they approve or disapprove of the last offer tabled by the creditors before the negotiations broke down. During a marathon parliamentary debate that ended in the early hours of Sunday morning, opposition leaders argued that it was, in fact, a vote on whether Greeks wished any longer to be part of the eurozone. It will be Greece\u2019s first referendum since the country voted to abolish its monarchy in 1974. The European commission said on Sunday for the first time in the crisis that it wanted to offer Greece debt relief, Tsipras\u2019s central demand during the five months of stalemated talks. Reports from Berlin said that Merkel and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, shared that view. Analysts are watching the impact of the Greek crisis on other economically weak eurozone economies, such as Portugal and Spain. \u201cThe events in Greece are a stark reminder that the current eurozone architecture is vulnerable to domestic politics,\u201d Francis Yared at Deutsche Bank said. Yared suggested that this could increase borrowing costs for weaker economies in southern Europe, unless the eurozone takes steps towards greater integration. \u201cThis in itself will justify some structural risk premium unless there is an institutional change or further economic convergence.\u201d",

But gold, a traditional safe haven in times of trouble, rose by 0.7% to $1,183.<br></p> <p>In an emotional appeal aimed directly at the Greek people the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, urged a \u201cyes\u201d vote next weekend to what he described as a fair proposal \u2013 \u201cnot stupid austerity\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf they vote yes it will mean that Greece wants to stay with other members of the eurozone,\u201d Junker said.<br></p> <p>Using his most heated rhetoric to date in a 45-minute press briefing largely devoted to defending his record in negotiations with Athens, he said: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t commit suicide because you are afraid of death.\u201d</p> <p>Juncker said he felt \u201ca little betrayed\u201d and accused the Greek government of lying about the proposal on the table. \u201cWe really moved mountains until the last minute when the Greek authorities closed the door.\u201d</p> <p>Some analysts criticised the inflammatory tone, saying it would not help. \u201cJuncker was clearly panic-stricken throughout the press conference because Tsipras has not only wrong-footed them but outmanoeuvred them,\u201d said Alexis Mantheakis, former spokesman of Greece\u2019s rightwing LAOS party. </p> <p>Recriminations were also flying over the prospect of debt relief for Greece. Juncker insisted an offer of debt relief was on the table, but an EU official clarified this was a question for a future bailout package. A close adviser to Tsipras accused the commission of offering nothing new.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/jun/29/greek-banks-shut-alexis-tsipras-eurozone-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4a7q9\"                        data-video-id=\"2328408\"            data-video-name=\"Greek banks remain shut as Alexis Tsipras promises money is safe \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters and AFP\"            data-video-poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435572333573/People-withdraw-money-fro-001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457300136\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435572333573/People-withdraw-money-fro-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/29/150629GreeceBanks_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/06/29/150629GreeceBanks_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/29/150629GreeceBanks.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/06/29/150629GreeceBanks_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/06/29/150629GreeceBanks_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Pensioners queue outside a closed bank in Athens on Monday morning hoping to withdraw some money.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>On Sunday, the commission took the unusual step of releasing the draft bailout agreement that creditors had been negotiating with Greece before talks broke down.

This was viewed as a necessary move as tourists were spotted joining locals in front of ATMs on Sunday. Any similar restriction would hurt tourism, Greece\u2019s sole thriving industry, which accounts for at least a fifth of economic activity.</p> <p>Tsipras said Saturday\u2019s move by the eurozone\u2019s finance chiefs to halt Greece\u2019s bailout programme was unprecedented. He called it \u201ca denial of the Greek public\u2019s right to reach a democratic decision\u201d.</p> <p>The European commission said on Monday that Greece\u2019s capital controls were \u201cnecessary and proportionate\u201d, but free movement of capital would need to be reinstated \u201cas soon as possible in the interests of the Greek economy, the eurozone and the European Union\u2019s single market as a whole\u201d.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee695cc0f6366f5b597d375e5b42a987e7899405\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee695cc0f6366f5b597d375e5b42a987e7899405/20_0_3944_2368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Tsipras\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, addresses to the country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tsipras added that the finance ministers\u2019 initiative had prompted the ECB to curb its assistance, forcing the government\u2019s hand. The Greek prime minister, who has always insisted the crisis can only be solved at the highest political levels, said he had once again appealed for an extension of the bailout until after the referendum, sending his proposal to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, the leaders of the other 18 member states of the single currency, the commission and the ECB.</p> <p>These leaders were the only ones, he said, who could overturn the decision of finance ministers taken on Saturday and enable the ECB to restore liquidity to banks.</p> <p>As fears spread on Sunday that capital controls would need to be put in place, growing numbers of depositors lined up at ATMs, even in affluent city areas, to withdraw what cash they could.<br></p> <p>Drivers also flocked to petrol stations across Greece, prompting the country\u2019s largest refiner to reassure motorists that there were enough reserves.

The vote on Sunday will ask Greeks whether they approve or disapprove of the last offer tabled by the creditors before the negotiations broke down.</p> <p>During a marathon parliamentary debate that ended in the early hours of Sunday morning, opposition leaders argued that it was, in fact, a vote on whether Greeks wished any longer to be part of the eurozone. It will be Greece\u2019s first referendum since the country voted to abolish its monarchy in 1974.</p> <p>The European commission said on Sunday for the first time in the crisis that it wanted to offer Greece debt relief, Tsipras\u2019s central demand during the five months of stalemated talks. Reports from Berlin said that Merkel and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, shared that view.</p> <p>Analysts are watching the impact of the Greek crisis on other economically weak eurozone economies, such as Portugal and Spain. \u201cThe events in Greece are a stark reminder that the current eurozone architecture is vulnerable to domestic politics,\u201d Francis Yared at Deutsche Bank said.</p> <p>Yared suggested that this could increase borrowing costs for weaker economies in southern Europe, unless the eurozone takes steps towards greater integration. \u201cThis in itself will justify some structural risk premium unless there is an institutional change or further economic convergence.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "After dramatic developments in Greece over the weekend sent the euro falling, shares tumbling and forced up yields on some government bonds, City analysts have put out a range of views on whether the country can stay in the single currency and the how markets might react if it crashed out. One immediate question is what the European Central Bank (ECB) could do if Greece fails to make a crucial loan payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday. Analysts at Barclays Things are moving fast, but developments over the weekend have heightened the risk of an eventual Greek default and exit from the euro. Initially, this news is unlikely to be taken well by European equity markets. However, we think that the current crisis \u2013 whatever the outcome \u2013 will probably not damage the longer-term prospects for European equities. Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer, Fidelity Worldwide Investment I think we are witnessing the maximum level of concern about Greece on Monday. European markets are down 4% and the US is indicated to fall 2%. Soon though, investors in New York and Beijing will be thinking about more local issues such as the prospect of a Federal rate hike in September and further rate cuts in China. These decisions are more likely to have a profound impact on equities than the concluding chapter of a well-documented Greek default. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group Per se, Greece is not too big to fail as the market exposure to Greece has diminished significantly over the past weeks. The main risk is contagion. It is a certainty: the Greek exit can only hurt the entire eurozone in the short run due to the lack of visibility, higher volatilities and erratic capital flows. Depending on the costs and benefits of a Grexit, the others will have the choice to take it or leave it. This is a crucial test for the euro. David Lamb, head of dealing, FEXCO Currency traders with a weak constitution should take a holiday, and fast. Those remaining at their posts face another week of white knuckles and heart palpitations as the Greek crisis enters its endgame. The week promises extreme volatility as the markets are likely to clutch at any sign of clarity. There is no blueprint for any of this, as both Greece and the euro enter uncharted waters. The only certainty is that Monday\u2019s rollercoaster ride is merely the start. Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist, BNY Mellon We are likely to be in something of a holding pattern until the close of play on Tuesday when we discover whether Athens has made its bundled payment to the IMF. Once this has been established, the next question will be what the ECB governing council will do next. Darren Ruane, head of fixed interest, Investec Wealth &amp; Investment Market participants will be watching closely as events over the next few days unfold, starting with the probable default on the IMF loan on Tuesday. A Greek exit from the eurozone and the EU has become increasingly likely and investors in European risk assets are demanding higher-risk premiums. Meanwhile, the capital controls introduced to Greek banks could lead to the issuance of a parallel currency and global economic uncertainty. Jaisal Pastakia, investment manager, Heartwood Investment Management Based on Bloomberg data at the end of 2014, our analysis of European banks\u2019 exposure to total Greek debt is 8%, nearly all of it owned by Greece\u2019s Eurobank, and to a lesser extent, Piraeus. To place this in context, Barclay\u2019s exposure is minimal at \u20ac1.29m (\u00a3910,000), or less than 0.01% of privately held Greek debt. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Investors tend to dislike uncertainty, of which we are faced with at least another week\u2019s worth until the referendum on the creditor proposals next weekend. It is possible that the Greek public will vote yes to the proposals, in which case we might be in a situation where a new government will likely need to be put in place to do a deal with the creditors. This would probably be taken well by investors as it would significantly reduce the risk of Greece leaving the euro.",

The main risk is contagion. It is a certainty: the Greek exit can only hurt the entire eurozone in the short run due to the lack of visibility, higher volatilities and erratic capital flows. Depending on the costs and benefits of a Grexit, the others will have the choice to take it or leave it. This is a crucial test for the euro.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>David Lamb, head of dealing, </strong><a href=\"http://www.fexco.com/\"><strong>FEXCO</strong></a></h2> <blockquote> <p data-dropid=\"0\">Currency traders with a weak constitution should take a holiday, and fast. Those remaining at their posts face another week of white knuckles and heart palpitations as the Greek crisis enters its endgame. The week promises extreme volatility as the markets are likely to clutch at any sign of clarity. There is no blueprint for any of this, as both Greece and the euro enter uncharted waters. The only certainty is that Monday\u2019s rollercoaster ride is merely the start.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist, </strong><strong>BNY Mellon</strong></h2> <blockquote> <p data-dropid=\"0\">We are likely to be in something of a holding pattern until the close of play on Tuesday when we discover whether Athens has made its bundled payment to the IMF. Once this has been established, the next question will be what the ECB governing council will do next.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Darren Ruane, head of fixed interest, Investec Wealth &amp; Investment</strong></h2> <blockquote> <p data-dropid=\"1\">Market participants will be watching closely as events over the next few days unfold, starting with the probable default on the IMF loan on Tuesday. A Greek exit from the eurozone and the EU has become increasingly likely and investors in European risk assets are demanding higher-risk premiums. Meanwhile, the capital controls introduced to Greek banks could lead to the issuance of a parallel currency and global economic uncertainty.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Jaisal Pastakia, investment manager, Heartwood Investment Management</strong></h2> <blockquote> <p data-dropid=\"0\">Based on Bloomberg data at the end of 2014, our analysis of European banks\u2019 exposure to total Greek debt is 8%, nearly all of it owned by Greece\u2019s Eurobank, and to a lesser extent, Piraeus. To place this in context, Barclay\u2019s exposure is minimal at \u20ac1.29m (\u00a3910,000), or less than 0.01% of privately held Greek debt.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></h2> <blockquote> <p data-dropid=\"0\">Investors tend to dislike uncertainty, of which we are faced with at least another week\u2019s worth until the referendum on the creditor proposals next weekend. It is possible that the Greek public will vote yes to the proposals, in which case we might be in a situation where a new government will likely need to be put in place to do a deal with the creditors. This would probably be taken well by investors as it would significantly reduce the risk of Greece leaving the euro.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s stock market slumped into bear market territory amid panicky trading on Monday, despite its central bank unexpectedly cutting interest rates over the weekend in an effort to stem the selling. The Shanghai composite index has now lost more than 20% since its recent peak on 10 June, putting it into official correction territory after it more than doubled over the last year. Even including these losses, however, the index is still up more than 29% since January. The latest falls have been partly fuelled by fears of a growing crackdown by regulators on loans used to speculate on shares, amid concerns that some investors were being forced to sell at a loss if the falling markets triggered breaches in their borrowing terms. Traders also said the share price boom was out of kilter with the Chinese economy, which is now growing at its slowest pace for six years. The index closed a further 3.34% lower at 4053.03 on Monday after losing more than 7% at one point in one of the most volatile sessions the market has seen. The escalating financial crisis in Greece also contributed to uncertainty. On Friday, the index closed 7.4% lower. ING Bank said: \u201cTrying to create an environment for a healthy stock market without stoking speculative excess has proved challenging. Like all recent sharp corrections, Friday\u2019s was triggered by fears of a crackdown on margin lending after a local broker took steps to curb margin holdings.\u201d There was little comfort from the central bank\u2019s move on Saturday to cut a key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.85% and reduce the reserve requirements \u2013 the amount of reserves that banks are required to hold \u2013 by 50 basis points. The bank said one of the policy goalswas to calm stock market fluctuations. Analysts at UBS said: \u201cAfter Friday\u2019s ... market plunge, many turned to the authorities for support measures as concerns rose that the rapid unwinding of margin trades was fuelling the sell-off. \u201cAs such, Saturday\u2019s monetary easing will surely give the impression that monetary policy is being used as a direct response to stock market fluctuations. While this belief can help ensure near-term market stability, the impact on longer-term market health is less clear.\u201d Samuel Chien, at Shanghai hedge fund BoomTrent Investment Management, told Reuters: \u201cThe market is still fragile because the clean-up of grey-market margin financing is still going on, and last week\u2019s market tumble triggered some margin calls and some investors are under pressure to sell.\u201d Meanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that recent rate cuts had not prevented shares from falling: \u201cShort-term bounce aside, we doubt that the latest cuts will trigger any sustained rally.\u201d",

Tour operators have been evacuating tourists from Tunisia after a gunman killed 39 people in a beach attack claimed by Islamic state. Tui, whose subsidiaries Thomson and First Choice had around 6,400 customers across Tunisia at the time, has fallen 73p or 6.5% to \u00a310.40. Meanwhile with Greece seemingly on the way to defaulting after dramatic events over the weekend and banks shut for a week, there are worries about the effects of the crisis on holidaymakers\u2019 plans. British Airways owner International Airlines Group is down 17p at 497.5p. EasyJet is 35p lower at \u00a315.42. Panmure Gordon analyst Gert Zonneveld said easyJet was well placed with only 3% of its business related to Greece and a minimal amount to Tunisia.

Overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 95.90 points at 6657.80, although it is off its worst levels of 6598.

European markets have been worse hit, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both down 3%. Investors are also nervous about the Chinese market, which is in bear market territory despite the central bank cutting interest rates over the weekend. Among the few FTSE 100 gains were precious metal miners as investors sought havens amid the turmoi. Randgold Resources has risen 47p to \u00a344.21 while Fresnillo is 2.5p better at 700.5p.
