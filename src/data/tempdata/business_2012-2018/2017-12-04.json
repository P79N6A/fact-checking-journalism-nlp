      "bodyText": "So, not the most convincing rally we\u2019ve ever seen. And who can blame traders? There\u2019s plenty of reasons to be cautious, frankly - the stalling Brexit talks, the Michael Flynn situation, and the ongoing North Korean tensions for starters. Plus the fact that stock valuations do look a little high..... So we\u2019ll find out tomorrow whether the Trump bump continues, or if markets take a breather. Until then, goodnight, and thanks for reading. GW NEWSFLASH! America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new record high, thanks to optimism over Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. But....the rally did threaten to fizzle out. In the end, the Dow only gained around 58 points to 24,290 - a gain of 0.25%. That takes the blue-chip index to a new closing peak, extending the rally sine Trump won the US presidential election 13 months ago. Tech stocks had a bad day, dragging the Nasdaq down. The S&amp;P 500 also lost its early sparkle, and closed a little lower. Traders may have decided to \u2018sell the news\u2019 and bank profits, especially with other issues swirling over the White House.... Now this wasn\u2019t in the script. With 15 minutes to go, the rally is running out of puff. The S&amp;P 500 is now pretty-much flat, and the Dow is shedding some of its gains too - now up just 0.3%. The tech selloff seems to be responsible. Technology stocks are still refusing to join the rally. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down almost 1% today, partly due to big names like PayPal (down 5.8%), Adobe (down 5.6%) and NVIDIA (down 5.1%). The chatter on Wall Street is that investors are moving out of tech, and into financial stocks, consumer-focused companies and industrial companies today. With around 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is toying with a new closing high. The Dow is up 160 points at 24,391, as traders keep giving the tax reforms push a thumbs-up (despite the reservations we\u2019ve already flagged up). Disney is the top riser, up almost 5%. That\u2019s due to reports that talks have resumed with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox to buy some of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets. Boeing are next on the Dow risers chart, up 3%, followed by chemicals giant DowDuPont (+2.6%) and JPMorgan Chase (+2.5%). Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn\u2019t terribly impressed by today\u2019s stock market rally. It\u2019s all so terribly short term, he writes... Once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Here\u2019s Nils\u2019 column: The US stock market rally could head even higher, if the two houses of Congress can agree a final tax bill. Mike Bell of JP Morgan believes the tax trade has more legs, adding (via the FT): We estimate that the market is only pricing in about a 50% probability of tax cuts and that if a tax plan is finalised this would push US equities higher. The Dow Jones continues to enjoy a good day, up around 200 points at 24,430. Financial stocks are still leading the charge, up 1.7%. But tech stocks aren\u2019t coming to the party. Facebook and Google are both down 0.5% while Microsoft has shed 2%. European stock markets have closed higher tonight, led by Germany: The eurozone\u2019s finance ministers have elected a new leader - Portugal\u2019s Mario Centeno. So his predecessor Jeroen Dijsselbloem really did give the game away earlier when he described Centeno as his successor, before the vote had even taken place..... It\u2019s official - no Brexit breakthrough today. The pound is now dropping back, after DUP leader (and Theresa May ally) Arlene Foster warned that her party wouldn\u2019t accept any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That could be a spanner in the works for May\u2019s Brexit breakthrough..... It has nudged sterling back below $1.35, and wiping out most of today\u2019s gains. Wall Street investors are hoping that a final tax deal can be done soon (ironing out differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives). Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, explains (via Marketwatch): \u201cGetting the tax plan done will still be a challenge, but it doesn\u2019t seem as impossible as it once did, and now there\u2019s optimism that it could happen before the end of the year, which means it could be made retroactive and change the liability for companies and individuals for this year as well as next, which would be a positive. Here\u2019s a sobering thought. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has predicted that thousands of Americans will die early, if the tax changes approved by the Senate go through. CNBC has the details: About 10,000 Americans will die every year from lack of health coverage if the tax reform bill goes through as proposed, Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and White House economic advisor under Barack Obama, said Monday. Citing studies on what happens to people who go from being insured to uninsured, Summers said the estimate is likely conservative. \u201cI think this bill is very dangerous,\u201d he said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d program. \u201cWhen people lose health insurance, they\u2019re less likely to get preventive care, they\u2019re more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they\u2019re more likely to die.\u201d Reports are coming through that the Eurogroup has approved the policy package agreed over the weekend by Athens and its creditors. The county\u2019s leading daily, Kathimerini, says Euro group chairman, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, welcomed the deal ahead of the meeting telling the assembled media \u201cit was exceptional\u201d it had been agreed in time. The deal paves the way to Greece receiving fresh rescue funds from its current and third international bailout pushing the country inexorably towards self-finance when the \u20ac86bn rescue programme officially expires next August. Stocks are racing higher in New York, as traders cheer the US Senate\u2019s tax vote. The Dow Jones has now gained an impressive 300 points, or 1.2%, to 24,532. That shows that Wall Street is applauding the prospect of corporation tax being cut from 35% to around 20%. Walt Disney is the biggest gainer, up 3.8% (readers should insert their own joke about the financial markets being a Mickey Mouse operation). Aeroplane maker Boeing are up 3.3%, with financial stocks and basic materials companies also having a good day. Before we get carried away, let\u2019s remember that barely half of all Americans own stocks (either individual shares or through retirement accounts). Inevitably, they will be the wealthier members of society -- who are also in the front line to benefit from Trump\u2019s tax changes (as this charts showed). Gallup reported earlier this year that stock ownership has contracted since the financial crisis, especially among younger and less-wealthy Americans. But share ownership has held firm among Adults aged 65 and older and those with an annual household income of at least $100,000. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The Dow jumped by 244 points to 24,475, a gain of around 1%, as New York traders applaud the prospect of tax reform legislation hitting the statute book. The S&amp;P 500, which tracks a broader group of US companies, is also at record levels. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says corporate America approves of Trump\u2019s efforts: Tax reform is popular with US businesses. The proposed law could reduce corporate tax rates to 20% (compared to 35% currently) and cut individual taxes too. Today, the honour of ringing the Wall Street opening bell goes to Groupon, the deals website.... There\u2019s quite a festive mood on Wall Street today, partly thanks to the impressive Christmas tree outside the New York Stock Exchange. New York traders should prepare for a lively opening, when trading begins on Wall Street in 30 minutes. A fresh record high looks nailed on, following the Senate\u2019s tax approval vote. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explain: The Dow Jones is set to strap a rocket to its back after the bell, with the futures pointing to a 220 point surge. That\u2019d leave the Dow at \u2013 what else \u2013 a fresh all time high of around 24450, already making last Friday\u2019s FBI-revelations inspired panic a distant memory. The pound has now hit a six-month high against a basket of currencies. Elsewhere in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are gathering for a eurogroup meeting. They\u2019ll be electing their next president, to succeed Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Officially it\u2019s a close contest, with four candidates throwing their caps into the ring: Although, the chat may be out of the sac.... It could also be a big day for Greece, with the leftist-led government presenting the deal it has reached in ongoing bailout negotiations with creditor. Athens officials hope for a warm reception from the euro group, marking the beginning of the end of international surveillance for debt-stricken Greece. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: With a compliance review completed in record time over the weekend, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tskakalotos will present the deal (referred to as staff level agreement) to euro area finance ministers today. The policy package, a key part of the country\u2019s third bailout programme review, must be approved by the euro group before another tranche of aid worth \u20ac5bn can be released to Greece. If rubber-stamped today \u2013 less than two months after talks began - the disbursement could be made in January. \u201cAlthough a lot of the measures are sensitive the real news is that the agreement was concluded in record time,\u201d said one insider. \u201cIt is recognised that we are committed to exiting the [bailout] programme.\u201d It\u2019s not all plain sailing. Under the deal, which covered issues ranging from energy and labour market reforms, bad loans and privatisations and tax measures, Greece will have to implement around 100 \u2018prior actions\u2019 or reforms by January. The demand that Athens presses ahead with more foreclosures \u2013 a necessary evil if banks are to deal with the highest non-performing loan ratio in the euro zone \u2013 is particularly sensitive. Many Greeks, unable to keep up with bank payments, fear they could lose their homes. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government is especially keen to wrap up the review (and negotiations more generally with creditors) so it can exit the \u20ac86bn bailout programme, the country\u2019s third, next summer. Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). Here\u2019s a neat chart, showing how morale in Britain\u2019s construction and manufacturing sectors picked up in November. Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month. The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.1415, thanks to those reports of a deal over the Irish border. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough: \u201cIt is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months. Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.\u201d But.... there\u2019s confusion over whether Britain is really offering \u201cno divergence\u201d on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply \u201ccontinued regulatory compliance\u201d. The final decision will be crucial. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The president is up, and predicting a Wall Street rally today: Sterling is pushing higher against the euro and the US dollar, following reports that Britain and the EU are close to a breakthrough. After a slow start, the pound is now up half a cent against the dollar at $1.352. Against the euro, it\u2019s gained three-quarters of a eurocent at \u20ac1.14. It follows reports that Britain has made a key concession over the Irish border. According to MEPs, the UK has offered no divergence between Northern Ireland the Republic over single market and customs union rules. Irish broadcaster RTE says it would have \u201cfar-reaching implications\u201d. But it\u2019s not clear that Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP party would accept it -- which is significant, as they\u2019re currently propping up Theresa May\u2019s government. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: The loudest complaint against Trump\u2019s tax \u2018reforms\u2019 is that the richest Americans will benefit the most. And yesterday, the bi-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed very clearly that this is true: Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned that the US budget deficit could spiral to $1 trillion by the end of the decade, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s tax shake-up. He fears it will precede a squeeze on government spending, potentially hurting welfare spending. Economics lecturer Stephen Kinsella of Ireland\u2019s University of Limerick agrees that the fiscal axe will soon fall on US government spending. A bit of work still needs to be done before Donald Trump can sign off a tax reform bill. That\u2019s because the Senate and the House of Representatives (America\u2019s upper and lower chambers) have both passed different legislation. The two versions now need to be merged, starting today - creating an opportunity for lawmakers to raise objections. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It is by no means a done deal given that the Senate bill is different to the one passed by Congress in November which means any final version is likely to be revised, and then passed by both houses, before being sent for signature by the President. What is unlikely to change are the headline numbers, which means that we can expect to see the corporation tax rate number reduced substantially from its current 35% to as low as 20%. After a stellar year, world stock markets are closing in on a new record -- $100 trillion! Over in New York, Wall Street traders will be waking up to predictions of another record-breaking open in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is forecast to jump by over 200 points, following the Senate\u2019s approval of US tax reforms over the weekend. It means the long rally since Trump\u2019s shock election win will continue.... Barbara Kollmeyer of Marketwatch puts it: The gains came as investors shifted their focus away from political tensions in Washington and cheered weekend news that Senate Republicans passed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code..... Hopes that the Trump administration and Republicans would usher in a business-friendly tax overhaul have been a driver for the stock market\u2019s record-setting streak over the past year. The House and Senate now must agree on a single tax bill before it can be sent to Trump to sign. Blane Perrotton, managing director of the national surveyors Naismiths, says UK housebuilders are feeling more upbeat. \u201cAfter the Autumn Budget, developers feel like they have the Government behind them and that is further boosting confidence and activity levels. \u201cResidential development is certainly the most active it has been since before the Global Financial Crisis. \u201cOn the frontline we\u2019re seeing a huge amount of activity, especially among small and mid-sized developers, who are making the most of the vastly increased finance options available. This jump in the UK\u2019s construction PMI is a little surprising, says Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Jones reckons confidence among builders is quite \u2018brittle, adding: \u201cAnecdotal feedback indicates that margins are coming under pressure with competition increasing amid the ongoing economic uncertainty. Larger firms also feel caught in the middle between clients pushing for fixed-price contracts and investors hungry for fatter margins. Construction bosses are also worried that the might struggle to find enough skilled labour after Brexit, Jones adds - although others are keen to invest in their UK workforce. Breaking: Britain\u2019s construction sector grew at its fastest rate in five months in November. Markit\u2019s latest PMI survey shows that housebuilding picked up last month, bringing some relief to Britain\u2019s builders after an autumn slowdown. That pushed the construction PMI up to 53.1, up from October\u2019s 50.8. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this is an encouraging signal. Here are the key findings: Residential work drives modest construction rebound in November Commercial and civil engineering activity continue to decline Business optimism picks up from October\u2019s near five-year low Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, blames political uncertainty for the slowdown in commercial construction activity and civil engineering work: \u201cUK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November. Once again, resilient house building growth helped to offset lower volumes of commercial work and civil engineering activity. \u201cSurvey respondents noted that residential projects underpinned the rebound in total new order growth to its strongest since June, helped by strong demand fundamentals and a supportive policy backdrop. \u201cConstruction firms reported that heightened economic and political uncertainty continued to hold back commercial development activity. The latest drop in civil engineering was linked to a recent lack of tender opportunities for infrastructure-related projects. Trump\u2019s push to cut America\u2019s corporation from 35% to 20% could encourage US companies to repatriate some of their immense overseas cash piles. Fortune Magazine says this is a victory for tech giants, who have lobbied hard on this issue: Tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have for a long time balked at the 35% corporate tax the current tax code requires them to pay on worldwide profits returned to the U.S. To avoid paying, the companies have parked as much of their profit as possible in overseas subsidiaries in countries like Bermuda and Ireland, where tax rates are low. The Big 5 tech companies\u2013Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft\u2013currently have a combined $457 billion held in overseas subsidiaries. Apple holds more profits overseas than any other company, with Microsoft not far behind. More here: Big Tech\u2019s Lobbying Splurge Is About To Pay Off With The Tax Vote Europe\u2019s stock markets are recovering from Friday\u2019s shock news that former Trump advisor Michael Flynn had pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \u201cEuropean markets are playing catch up after closing at the depths of the Friday market meltdown on Michael Flynn concerns and embracing the weekend\u2019s senate tax bill success. The pro-business tax cuts look set to boost US economic growth and have provided further impetus for US and global valuations. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is up this morning. Multinational equipment rental firm Ashtead Group is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by cruise company Carnival and plumbing and heating firm Ferguson. Ashtead and Ferguson both have big operations in America, so would benefit if Trump\u2019s tax reforms do deliver a growth burst. All the major European stock markets are up this morning, after the US Senate approved the tax reform package over the weekend. The German DAX is leading the charge, up over 1%, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 and the French CAC close behind. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: The U.S. Senate\u2019s approval to pass the tax cut bill on Saturday overshadowed the continuing investigation into connections between U.S. President\u2019s inner circle and Russia. The US dollar has jumped by 0.5% against a basket of currencies this morning, reports Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Europe and America are set to rally today, after Donald Trump took a massive step towards shaking up the US tax system. In Trump\u2019s first legislative triumph, the Senate finally passed the president\u2019s long-awaited tax reform bill. The move means the president can look forward to signing off a final bill on tax reform soon. The reforms include a hefty cut to US corporation tax, down from 35% to 20%, bringing America into line with other advanced economies. There are also sweeping changes to individual tax rates - which Trump claims will make people \u201cvery, very happy\u2019. But...the \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d plan to cut taxes for \u201caverage Americans\u201d has been criticised by experts who say it\u2019s a shameless giveaway of wealth to the richest 1%. Republicans claim that the $1.4tn package of cuts can be funded through growth; but an independent committee found it could add $1 trillion to the national debt. Democrats, though, slammed the changes as a giveaway to corporate America and the wealthy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declared: \u201cIn the waning hours, this bill is tilting further towards businesses and away from families. \u201cEvery time the choice is between corporations and families, the Republicans choose corporations.\u201d But the financial world is welcoming the Senate vote, despite the pressure building on the White House over links with Russia. Today, Wall Street is tipped to open strongly, possibly driving the Dow Jones to a new all-time high. The FTSE 100 has already reacted, jumping by 60 points to 7360 at the start of trading in London. But sterling is under pressure this morning as Theresa May heads to Brussels for crunch talks with the EU. The pound has shed almost half a cent at $1.343, amid reports that London and Dublin haven\u2019t (yet) reached an agreement on the Irish border. As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reported last night: Theresa May and the Irish government have failed to reach a deal on the crucial Brexit issue of the Northern Ireland border ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday lunchtime with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Despite intense efforts over the weekend to agree a proposal on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Irish officials revealed at midnight on Sunday that \u201cthere is still a way to go\u201d to achieve a meeting of minds on the issue. But there could be plenty of drama in Brussels, as Britain pushes for a breakthrough that would pave the way for trade talks. Also coming up today, we get a new health check on Britain\u2019s builders (who have been struggling in recent months) plus the latest eurozone investor confidence index and US factory orders figures. Here\u2019s the agenda 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI for October 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix investor confidence report 3pm GMT: US factory orders for October",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Senate committee will investigate ExxonMobil\u2019s Australian tax records following revelations the oil and gas company paid no corporate income tax in Australia for at least two years. Public records released by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) show ExxonMobil Australia reported no taxable income and paid no corporate tax in 2013-14 and 2014-15, despite reporting an annual income of $9.6bn and $8.5bn respectively. For the same period, Woodside, an Australian-owned oil and gas company with a slightly lower total income than ExxonMobil and a declared taxable income of $4.8bn from 2013-2015, paid $1.1bn in Australian corporate tax. The Senate committee inquiry into corporate tax avoidance is expected to announce on Tuesday that it plans to extend its hearings to examine ExxonMobil\u2019s records, after three trade unions announced the findings of a report on the company\u2019s conduct. The report, by Tax Justice Network\u2019s Jason Ward, cited the company\u2019s US filings that showed it had US$54bn in \u201cindefinitely reinvested, undistributed earnings\u201d in offshore holdings. It traced its ownership though the Netherlands to the Bahamas, where, according to the Paradise Papers, it has 575 subsidiaries, including three directly linked to Australia. Exxon\u2019s 2016 filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also state the ATO was still examining its Australian tax filings from 2008 to 2016. Ward said ExxonMobil also had $18.5bn in offshore-related party loans and suggested it was \u201cmore aggressive\u201d in pursuing this policy than fellow oil and gas company Chevron, which reached a reported $1bn settlement with the ATO after the federal court found against it in a landmark profit-shifting decision in April. Chevron had $42bn in related party debt, while Exxon has $18.5bn in consolidated related party debt. Exxon made $1.2bn in debt repayments in 2016, amounting to 1.7% of its total revenue. \u201cThe scale of Exxon is significantly smaller than Chevron, but it looks like they are even more aggressive in their tactics,\u201d Ward told Guardian Australia. In a 2015 submission to the Senate inquiry on tax avoidance, Exxon said the ATO was reviewing its international related-party financial dealings. \u201cWe are not aware of any negative finding by the ATO in respect of these dealings,\u201d it said. Ward also suggested Exxon had failed to disclose its offshore ownership structure. The ATO began publicly releasing corporate tax data only two years ago. Data for the 2015-16 financial year is expected to be released on Friday. The full Tax Justice Network report is also expected to be released on Friday. New South Wales Labor senator Jenny McAllister, who sits on the committee, said it was her \u201cstrong view\u201d the committee should examine allegations Exxon \u201cengaged in aggressive corporate tax avoidance\u201d. \u201cIf true, reports that Exxon can simultaneously report a total $18bn of revenue, whilst paying no corporate tax sound implausible,\u201d McAllister said, in a statement to Guardian Australia. \u201cI am also concerned about the company\u2019s attempts to slash the wages and conditions of the workers who do the work that allow them to record such healthy returns.\u201d The Electrical Trades Union, Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union, and Australian Workers\u2019 Union presented the findings in Canberra on Monday. Unions have been engaged in a long-running dispute with Exxon subsidiary Esso and contractor UGL over the wages and conditions at its Bass Strait operations. Ged Kearney, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said the report showed Australia\u2019s tax rules were \u201cbroken\u201d. \u201cWe need to change the rules so that parliamentary intervention is not required to get a company to pay its taxes and working people are not forced out of decent, paying jobs,\u201d Kearney said. In a statement, a spokesman for ExxonMobil said the union\u2019s protest against the company \u201ccontinues to provide misinformation about ExxonMobil\u201d. \u201cExxonMobil Australia\u2019s entities have made a significant contribution to the Australian economy through the reliable supply of energy to fuel economic growth, as well as through direct tax and royalty payments to state and federal governments,\u201d he said. The statement did not address the information in publicly available ATO data, which showed zero Australian corporate income tax paid in 2013-14 and 2014-15. It went on to summarise a document titled \u201ctax facts\u201d linked from the front page of ExxonMobil Australia\u2019s website, which said it paid more than $2bn a year in total taxes and stood behind its returns positions. \u201cWe hold a documented, longstanding reputation with tax authorities for integrity and professionalism,\u201d it said. The statement also said Exxon had paid $12bn in the petroleum resource rent tax over its Gippsland Basin and Bass Strait operations, managed by Esso, since that tax was introduced in 1990. Those payments are listed in the ATO\u2019s database. It said it experienced a corporate income tax loss in 2016 and \u201cexpect to continue to be in an income tax loss position in the short term while the significant recent investment we have made generates sufficient income streams to offset past losses.\u201d",

Unions have been engaged in a long-running dispute with Exxon subsidiary Esso and contractor UGL over the wages and conditions at its Bass Strait operations.</p> <p>Ged Kearney, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said the report showed Australia\u2019s tax rules were \u201cbroken\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to change the rules so that parliamentary intervention is not required to get a company to pay its taxes and working people are not forced out of decent, paying jobs,\u201d Kearney said.</p> <p>In a statement, a spokesman for ExxonMobil said the union\u2019s protest against the company \u201ccontinues to provide misinformation about ExxonMobil\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cExxonMobil Australia\u2019s entities have made a significant contribution to the Australian economy through the reliable supply of energy to fuel economic growth, as well as through direct tax and royalty payments to state and federal governments,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The statement did not address the information in publicly available ATO data, which showed zero Australian corporate income tax paid in 2013-14 and 2014-15.</p> <p>It went on to summarise <a href=\"http://www.exxonmobil.com.au/en-au/company/news-and-updates/publications/exxonmobil-australia-tax-facts\">a document titled \u201ctax facts\u201d</a> linked from the front page of ExxonMobil Australia\u2019s website, which said it paid more than $2bn a year in total taxes and stood behind its returns positions. \u201cWe hold a documented, longstanding reputation with tax authorities for integrity and professionalism,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The statement also said Exxon had paid $12bn in the petroleum resource rent tax over its Gippsland Basin and Bass Strait operations, managed by Esso, since that tax was introduced in 1990. Those payments are listed in the ATO\u2019s database.</p> <p>It said it experienced a corporate income tax loss in 2016 and \u201cexpect to continue to be in an income tax loss position in the short term while the significant recent investment we have made generates sufficient income streams to offset past losses.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Congratulations, Simon Thompson, current non-executive director of Rio Tinto, you are deemed sufficiently safe to step up to the chairmanship. The world\u2019s second biggest mining company didn\u2019t describe the appointment in this way, of course \u2013 but nor did it refer to the extraordinary behind-the-scenes lobbying that killed the hopes of the board\u2019s original preferred candidate, Sir Mick Davis. It was already known that the process had been hijacked by big shareholders, who had written to Rio to say they weren\u2019t keen on Davis, the former boss of Xstrata and the current chairman of the Conservative party. But the blistering tone of the now-leaked letter is worth noting. It is hard to recall a similar instance of a board of a large FTSE 100 company being read the riot act over the appointment of a chairman. Here\u2019s an extract: Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Investor Forum, which represents big fund management groups, said he was relating the views of 13 shareholders representing 20% of the London investor base and wrote on 21 November: \u201cWhile these long-term shareholders are supportive of the company and its operational strategy, given the challenges facing the organisation, they are of the strong opinion that the individual currently being identified in the media as a potential chairman is not an acceptable candidate. \u201cThe clear position of these shareholders would suggest that the company should expect a very hostile audience should it choose to pursue this course of action.\u201d Davis\u2019s business career has always divided opinion. Some fund managers applaud the deal-making that built Xstrata into a $50bn company at the moment he was taken over by Glencore. Others can\u2019t stomach the personal rewards for Xstrata\u2019s top brass, including the \u00a3140m retention package that executives were offered to stay after the takeover. But, remember, Davis had been interviewed and picked by the board of Rio as the frontrunner. A U-turn in these circumstances is unusual. A welcome victory for shareholder power? Up to a point. Almost everybody is in favour of big investors engaging actively with companies and, in this case, there\u2019s a fair argument that Rio doesn\u2019t need a swashbuckling, deal-making chairman at a moment when it is preaching a gospel of disciplined capital allocation. That, as it happens, was this column\u2019s view a few weeks ago. But, in Davis\u2019s shoes, you would also want to know why the Investor Forum mentioned \u201chigh personal integrity\u201d as one of three \u201ckey investor considerations for this appointment\u201d. That could be read as a general comment. But, in the context of the letter, it could also be taken as personal, nasty and below the belt. Davis, a well-known philanthropist, is entitled to an explanation. Stock market highs are just a sugar rush Another day, another record for Wall Street, and another chance for Donald Trump to spin the shallow idea that his presidency must be successful because stock prices are rising. The notion is shallow because cutting corporate taxes \u2013 and thereby delivering an instant boost to companies\u2019 earnings \u2013 was always likely to push the stock market higher. The process is almost mechanical, especially for big US-focused companies such as banks and energy companies. But, once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Workers on boards? How about a non-executive director? Let\u2019s recall, one last time, that ground-breaking pledge made by Theresa May in her brief period as a corporate reformer: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.\u201d In the latest proposed tweaks to the corporate governance code, there\u2019s no sign of either consumers or workers being installed on the boards of public companies. Taking its cue from the government\u2019s green paper, the Financial Reporting Council says companies can take their pick from one of three options. They can indeed nominate an employee to serve on the board. Or they can create an employee advisory council, if they don\u2019t have one already. Or they can just assign a non-executive director to look out for employees\u2019 interests. This third option is known as kicking the issue into the long grass. It will be popular.",

    "webTitle": "Wall Street sets record highs after passage of Donald Trump's tax cuts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares on Wall Street have hit record levels as financial markets around the world anticipate the biggest package of US tax cuts since Ronald Reagan was in the White House in the 1980s. Investors bought heavily into US stocks after Donald Trump received approval from the Senate for reforms that offer the biggest reduction in taxes to corporations and those on high incomes. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 hit record levels in early trading but later fell back because of a sell-off of technology stocks, which have seen substantial price rises this year. But there was heavy buying of telecom, bank, financial and other shares in sectors seen as benefiting from the tax cuts \u2013 the centrepiece of Trump\u2019s economic strategy. The technology sector is expected to benefit less because it already enjoys low tax rates. Although the final details of the package have still to be finalised through an agreement between the Senate and the House of Representatives, Wall Street believes that the president has finally succeeded in a near year-long battle to get Congress to support his plan. The Dow Jones closed just 58 points up, while the S&amp;P 500 was 0.1% down. The latter has risen about 18% since the start of the year on strong corporate earnings, economic growth and confidence that Trump would eventually get his tax cuts. Markets have shrugged off concerns that the cuts, like those in the 1980s, will lead to a ballooning of the US budget deficit. Mickey Levy, chief US economist at Berenberg, said he had revised up his growth forecasts for the world\u2019s biggest economy to 2.9% in 2018 and to 2.7% in 2019 as a result of the likely boost from the tax cuts. \u201cThe US Senate\u2019s narrow passage of its version of tax reform suggests strongly that the House and Senate will compromise their differences and tax legislation will be enacted by yearend 2017. \u201cWe expect the accelerated tax overhaul to add to the current positive momentum in the economy. The tax legislation includes some key provisions that are expected to have positive sustained impacts, lifting potential growth moderately, and fiscal stimulus through higher deficit spending that will provide a temporary boost to growth in 2018\u20132019 that will fade. The starting point for our forecast is very elevated levels of business and consumer confidence,\u201d Levy added. James Knightley, chief international analyst at ING bank, said the tax cuts would provide a fillip to US growth but added that a degree of scepticism was warranted. Knightley said the main beneficiaries of the personal tax cuts would be the top 1%, since the threshold for paying the top rate of income tax would more than double to $1m a year. Trump is proposing a cut in corporation tax from 35% to 20%. The cut could encourage US corporations to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars in profits they have stockpiled overseas rather than lose a large slice of them to the US tax authorities. Five big US tech companies \u2013 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Facebook \u2013 alone hold some $450bn overseas. However, Knightley said the effective rate paid by most companies was significantly lower than 35%, due to exemptions and credits. \u201cIn terms of the boost from income tax cuts, the Tax Policy Centre estimates that the top 1% of taxpayers would get 21% of the benefit in 2018 and 50% by 2027,\u201dKnightley said. \u201cWhile people on lower incomes would also on average see a positive impact on their finance,s this all suggest that the boost to consumer spending may not be great.\u201d On the currency markets, the pound lost all its early gains as it became clear that there had not been a decisive breakthrough in the Brexit talks. Sterling rose to just over $1.35 amid rumours that agreement had been reached over the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but closed just above $1.345.",

      "bodyText": "A report by the Grattan Institute into competition in the Australian economy has found that Australian markets are not especially concentrated compared with other nations. It also found that a greater market share held by a smaller number of firms does not necessarily lead to greater levels of profits. The report however does confirm that our supermarket sector is overly concentrated and policies can be implemented to ensure greater competition including a move already under way by the government to make it easier for consumers to switch between providers and control their own data. One of the more common consumer complaints is that there is not enough competition in major industries. The banking, supermarket and petrol retail sectors especially come under fire. A lack of competition and domination by a few firms can lead to implicit collusion \u2013 such as is often suggested occurs with petrol prices seeming to go up in unison on Thursday. The issue is not just a dry economic one. The shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, has written extensively on the issue, arguing that a lack of competition is damaging the economy. The report by the Grattan Institute\u2019s Jim Minifie, Competition in Australian, examined this issue and found somewhat surprisingly that while a lack of competition did hurt our economy, the damage was not as great as might be expected. Minifie argues that \u201clarge firms are not unusually dominant in Australia given the size of its economy\u201d and they \u201cdo not have an unusually large share of Australian output and employment\u201d. Take for example the banking sector. The market share of the top three banks is actually quite low compared with the rest of the OECD. While the market share of the top five is above average, it is \u201cnot much more concentrated than it is in other high-income economies of about the same size\u201d: But at least here the signs of increased market concentration are evident. As a result of mergers that were allowed to occur in the aftermath of the GFC, the market share held by the top four banks is significantly higher than it was at the start of the century: The issue is whether or not this impacts on reduced competition and thus hurts the economy as consumers end up having to pay more for services and goods that they otherwise would have. The problem Minifie found is that you can\u2019t just assume market concentration leads to higher profits. What is important is not just how many firms dominate an industry but also why they dominate. If \u2013 as in the case of banks \u2013 the reason for the concentration is mostly due to regulation, then the industry does not see a greater proportion of \u201csuper-normal profits\u201d (which are those that are greater than the expected shareholder return) than in other industries with low barriers to entry (such as builders, accommodation services or restaurants). But industries, which are either natural monopolies, where only a few firms can actually carry out the service (such as electricity generation or airports), or scale economies, where the cost of doing business is such that bigger has an inherent advantage (such as supermarkets, domestic airlines or petrol retailing), are much more likely to see above expected profits: Thus among the most concentrated industries, those which have the greatest share of the profits coming from \u201csuper-normal profits\u201d are those with either scale economies \u2013 ISPs, internet publishing, supermarkets, or are natural monopolies such as wired telecommunications. The Grattan Institute report on the other hand found banks report a lower share of super-normal profits than highly competitive industries such as motor vehicle retailers and childcare services. The report also found the largest businesses in Australia have not over the years taken a greater share of the overall revenue \u2013 with the biggest 20 firms since the early 1990s usually accounting for around 54% of total revenue received by all firms listed on the Australia stock exchange: This, however, does not mean there are no issues. Our supermarket sector is one of the most concentrated among high-income countries. Our two biggest firms in the sector (Woolworths and Coles) account for 69% of the market compared with 52% in Canada, 44% in Germany, 43% in the UK and 32% across the United States: However over the past decade the two big supermarkets have actually lost market share as Aldi and Costco have begun competing. Minifie suggests once Amazon Fresh and the German company Kaufland enter the market, the share held by Woolworths and Coles will continue to fall, which will lead to \u201cgreater diversity and lower prices\u201d. The report also recommends relaxing zoning restrictions that can limit the entry of competitors: By contrast thetelecommunications sector \u2013 both ISPs and mobile communication \u2013 while being very concentrated is not unusually so. The report notes that \u201chigh-income countries tend to have only three or four mobile networks, and their three-firm market shares typically exceed 80% \u2013 in Australia currently Telstra, Optus and Vodafone account for around 90%: But this is one area where the report notes policy progress can be made, and which the government is already making moves to introduce changes. The report argues that strong regulation aimed towards lower prices appears necessary for natural monopolies such as electricity distribution and transmission, ports and wired telecoms, given the level of their super-normal profits. But it also argues that consumers should have the power to \u201ctake their data with them to another provider\u201d to encourage competition in telecommunications, banking and other industries. Last week the assistant minister for cities and digital transformation, Angus Taylor, announced that next year the government would seek to legislate a \u201cconsumer data right\u201d which would enable customers \u201copen access to their banking, energy, phone and internet transactions\u201d. This would make it much easier to compare the cost of different services and crucially reduce the burden of switching banks or utility providers. The Grattan Institute report highlights that while market concentration can lead to excess profit-taking by firms, this mostly occurs in industries where the barriers to entry \u2013 either due to cost or the nature of the business \u2013 are high. In such cases the government needs to ensure firms are not taking advantage of consumers, but the report also makes clear that while firms have too much market power in a few industries, overall Australia\u2019s economy is little different from most nations.",

The intervention by the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee adds to the mounting pressure for an inquiry into SSE and npower combining to create an energy giant that will shrink the \u201cbig six\u201d suppliers to five. The GMB union recently said ministers should step in and block the merger if the competition watchdog fails to act. Rachel Reeves, chair of the BEIS committee, said: \u201cThe energy market isn\u2019t working for consumers. The proposed merger between SSE and npower risks damaging the development of a more competitive energy market, reducing consumer choice, and threatening to be a bad deal for energy consumers.\u201d The Labour MP has written to to Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, saying it was \u201cconcerning\u201d that the merger could undermine the market\u2019s competitiveness. \u201cThe merger would reduce the big six energy companies to five, with almost half of the domestic energy share held between British Gas and the proposed SSE-npower merged business,\u201d wrote Reeves. The chair urged the watchdog to look in detail at the possible impacts on the market and fully investigate the risk of reduced competition. Npower and SSE are in discussions with the CMA. The new firm would have more electricity customers than any other supplier and be only around 1m customer accounts behind market leader British Gas, which has been shedding hundreds of thousands of customers in recent months. An SSE spokesperson said: \u201cThe merger will improve competition by offering customers a completely new model combining the resources of established players with the agility and innovation of an independent supplier \u2013 turning 60 competitors into 59, not five, and ultimately offering better value for customers.\u201d A spokesperson for npower owner Innogy said: \u201cThe transaction will create a new, strong and independent British retail energy supplier, which will provide a better deal for consumers and help deliver the government\u2019s plans for more competition in the market.\u201d A CMA spokesperson said: \u201cWe will consider all mergers that meet the legal criteria for an investigation under the Enterprise Act.\u201d The BEIS committee is also tasked with scrutinising the government\u2019s draft legislation for an energy bills price cap, which is expected to take effect at the start of 2019, around the time the npower and SSE hope to wrap up a merger.

      "bodyText": "Struggling US retailer Toys R Us has confirmed plans to close to a third of its permanent UK stores but says all the branches will remain open through Christmas and the new year. Up to 800 jobs are threatened by the potential closure of at least 26 of Toys R Us\u2019s 84 permanent UK stores from spring next year. It is seeking to reduce the size of a further 26 stores along with rent reductions on those and 12 more stores. Steve Knights, the managing director of Toys R Us UK, said the company had to take \u201cstrong and decisive action\u201d as its largest warehouse-style stores opened in the 1980s and 1990s were \u201ctoo big and expensive to run in the current retail environment\u201d. On 21 December, Toys R Us will ask its creditors to approve a company voluntary agreement (CVA), an insolvency procedure used by retailers to close loss-making stores. The process, which will reduce its rental bill partly by closing stores, is being handled by Alvarez &amp; Marsal, a specialist adviser on corporate insolvencies. \u201cLike many UK retailers in today\u2019s market environment, we need to transform our business so that we have a platform that can better meet customers\u2019 evolving needs. The decision to propose this CVA was a difficult one, but we determined it is the best path forward to make essential changes to the business,\u201d Knights said. \u201cOur newer, smaller, more interactive stores are in the right shopping locations and are trading well, while our new website has generated significant growth in online and click-and-collect sales. But the warehouse-style stores we opened in the 1980s and 1990s, while successful in the early days, are too big and expensive to run in the current retail environment. The business has been loss-making in recent years and so we need to take strong and decisive action to accelerate the transformation.\u201d He said there would be no changes to the returns policies or gift cards across this period. The company\u2019s restructure comes during a tough run-up to Christmas for toy retailers; November sales are down 10%, according to one industry expert. Toys R Us is a subsidiary of the US chain, which filed for bankruptcy protection in September after running up $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debts. The UK business has been struggling for the same reasons as its parent, as shoppers shun the large out-of-town sheds that are synonymous with the Toys R Us brand, in favour of shopping online. Competition from supermarkets and the likes of Argos has ramped up. Toys R Us UK has been loss-making for seven out of the past eight years, with the most recent accounts filed at Companies House showing an operating loss of \u00a3500,000 on sales of \u00a3418m in the year to January. The accounts also show the write off of \u00a3584.5m in loans owed by a Toys R Us firm based in the British Virgin Islands as part of a group re-organisation. A subsidiary of the company, Toys R Us Holdings, shows a pension deficit of \u00a318.4m in January, up from \u00a310.25m a year before, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The company said it had an ongoing arrangement with the trustees of the pension fund to make additional contributions in respect of the deficit and the CVA would not change that arrangement. Frank Field MP, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, wrote on Monday to the pensions regulator and the chair of the company\u2019s pension fund trustees asking what impact the CVA and the write off of the BVI loans would have on pensioners. In October, it was reported that a number of suppliers had stopped delivering stock to Toys R Us in the UK because of problems with credit insurance.

      "bodyText": "The Unite union is seeking compensation for more than 70 construction workers who were \u201cblacklisted\u201d by some of Britain\u2019s biggest construction firms. The new legal action targets key individuals involved in a shadowy organisation, the Consulting Association, which the construction industry used to monitor more than 3,000 building workers. It comes after about \u00a310m was paid in compensation last year to more than 250 building workers on the blacklist, which is believed to have operated for 30 years. The Consulting Association\u2019s offices were raided by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office after revelations in the Guardian. The new case, involving workers not party to the previous legal action, names four individuals who all held the role of chairman at the Consulting Association: David Cochrane and Cullum McAlpine, previously of Sir Robert McAlpine; Danny O\u2019Sullivan, formerly of Kier; and Stephen Quant, previously of Skanska. Those companies and nine others are listed in the action, which alleges unlawful conspiracy, breach of privacy, defamation and Data Protection Act offences. The Unite assistant general secretary for legal affairs, Howard Beckett, said: \u201cUnite is determined to ensure that the people directly responsible for blacklisting workers and ruining their lives are brought to justice and have to answer for their actions. \u201cSince 2009, the individuals who were the controlling minds behind the systematic blacklisting of workers have sought to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. The workers who had their lives ruined deserve to see the leading blacklisters in court.\u201d It is understood that some of the workers involved in the new case have already been offered compensation, despite the formal closure of the previous compensation scheme. One source told the Guardian that 55 such claims had been \u201cfully settled\u201d. However, those individuals are understood to remain involved in the legal action as issues relating to retraining and apology remain. Sir Robert McAlpine said in a statement that it had a \u201czero-tolerance policy towards blacklisting, illegal or unfair recruitment practices and we expect all our sub-contractors to comply with this\u201d. It said it had also signed up to the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority construction protocol to protect workers from exploitation. \u201cBlacklisting in construction was, until 2009, an industry-wide issue \u2013 most of the largest British construction companies in operation today were involved in the past when there was no legislation in place to outlaw the practice. Sir Robert McAlpine has admitted to, and apologised for, its past involvement and has paid compensation to affected workers,\u201d it said. Only eight companies apologised and paid these financial settlements. Kier and Skanska declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "The public should be told whether the big banks are refusing to support a free-to-use cash machine network, according to the politician who led the campaign a decade ago to maintain access to ATMs around the UK. Proposals to change the way the Link network operates have prompted fears that up to 10,000 of the 55,000 free-to-use ATMs could either close or start charging. John McFall, who chaired the Treasury select committee for nine years until 2010, has now waded into the debate by urging the network to publish the responses to a consultation on its plan to cut the interchange fee that card providers pay to machine operators every time a customer withdraws cash. It would fall from 25p to 20p under the plan. \u201cThe public has a right to know where each of the major banks stands on these proposals and whether they are reneging on their commitment to support a widespread network of free-to-use ATMs,\u201d said Lord McFall, adding that the network was taking a \u201cleap in the dark\u201d as it did not know what the impact might be. \u201cKeeping their responses secret will do nothing for the trust of the public, which they are committed to re-establishing. It is unacceptable that this consultation is dominated by the views of the major banks and excludes the public and consumer groups which are not members of the Link consumer council.\u201d The consumer council was set up in 2006 and counts an MP, charities, banks and ATM providers among its members. Link has 30 members ranging from high street banks and building societies to the private companies which install machines around the UK. McFall conducted an inquiry into cash machines in 2005, while chair of the select committee, and later chaired a working party that devised a framework to keep ATMs free in low-income areas. He said the ATM network was becoming increasingly important in the light of branch closures. RBS announced plans on Friday to close 259 branches, a quarter of its network. Link, said the responses to the consultation \u2013 which closed last week \u2013 contained \u201ccommercially confidential inputs\u201d and would remain confidential. \u201cLink\u2019s policy remains to maintain extensive free ATM coverage. That is not changing. Providing free ATMs across the country, particularly in areas where other mechanisms, such as branches, are not available, remains key to Link\u2019s objectives and continues to be successfully achieved,\u201d John Howells, the chief executive of Link, said in a statement. The current system, he said, was leading to ATMs clustering in busy locations, whilst leaving more remote areas exposed to the risk of closure. He told Mail Online over the weekend that cash machines would disappear from high streets altogether in 10 years, with retailers becoming more important in dispensing cash from their tills.",

Link has 30 members ranging from high street banks and building societies to the private companies which install machines around the UK. <br></p> <p>McFall conducted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/nov/12/theobserver.observerbusiness5\">an inquiry into cash machines in 2005, </a>while chair of the select committee, and later chaired a working party that devised a framework to keep ATMs free in low-income areas.</p> <p>He said the ATM network was becoming increasingly important in the light of branch closures. RBS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/01/rbs-natwest-to-axe-680-jobs-as-it-closes-259-branches\">announced plans on Friday to close 259 branches, a quarter of its network</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/01/rbs-natwest-to-axe-680-jobs-as-it-closes-259-branches\">RBS to axe 680 jobs as it closes 259 branches</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Link, said the responses to the consultation \u2013 which closed last week \u2013 contained \u201ccommercially confidential inputs\u201d and would remain confidential. </p> <p>\u201cLink\u2019s policy remains to maintain extensive free ATM coverage. That is not changing. Providing free ATMs across the country, particularly in areas where other mechanisms, such as branches, are not available, remains key to Link\u2019s objectives and continues to be successfully achieved,\u201d John Howells, the chief executive of Link, said in a statement.</p> <p>The current system, he said, was leading to ATMs clustering in busy locations, whilst leaving more remote areas exposed to the risk of closure. </p> <p>He told Mail Online over the weekend that cash machines would disappear from high streets altogether in 10 years, with retailers becoming more important in dispensing cash from their tills. </p>",
