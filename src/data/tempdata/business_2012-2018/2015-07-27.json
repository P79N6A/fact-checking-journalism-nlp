      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s Helena Smith\u2019s take on today\u2019s developments: Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has been thrust back in the spotlight as he vigorously defended plans to launch a parallel payment system in the event of the country being ejected from the euro. Saying it would have been \u201cremiss\u201d of him not to have a \u201cplan B\u201d if negotiations with the country\u2019s creditors had collapsed, the outspoken politician admitted that a small team under his control had devised a parallel payment system. The secret scheme would have eased the way to the return of the nation\u2019s former currency, the drachma. \u201cGreece\u2019s ministry of finance would have been remiss had it made no attempt to draw up contingency plans,\u201d he said in a statement. But Varoufakis, who resigned this month to facilitate talks between Athens\u2019 left-led government and its creditors, denied that the group had worked as a rogue element outside government policy or beyond the confines of the law...... And that\u2019s a good time to stop for the night. Thanks, as ever, for reading and commenting. Goodnight! GW The leader of Syriza\u2019s far-left bloc, Panayotis Lafazanis, has given a defiant speech tonight: Here\u2019s our story about the big news of the morning - the biggest one-day rout on the Chinese stock market in eight years. It\u2019s still worth listening to the whole Varoufakis tape. But if you\u2019d rather read it, just take a trip to the FT for the transcript: In its latest economic check-up released today, the Fund has diagnosed the eurozone\u2019s outlook as distinctly gloomy. Read the full story here \u2026 Hello again. Alexis Tsipras has now made his appeal to party unity, as Helena flagged up earlier. And he did indeed call for a broad party conference to formulate strategy. Enikos has the details: \u201cOur strategy should be clarified with calmness and maturity through the party procedures,\u201d he told the party\u2019s political committee. \u201cSo we should plan for a conference as soon as possible, as envisaged by (the party\u2019s) charter.\u201d This conference would allow Syriza to rally set a new agenda, and adjust to the reality of the bailout deal agreed this month. And possibly announce an election in November.... Opinions varied on whether Tsipras pulled off the \u2018effortlessly stylish\u2019 look: Today\u2019s selloff means the FTSE 100 has lost all its gains this year. The blue chip index ended 2014 at 6566 points, and rallied to a lifetime high of 7103 points in late April this year But the Footsie has fallen over 8% since, pulled down by the Greek crisis, speculation of a US interest rate rise, fears that China\u2019s economy is slowing, and the drop in commodities prices. Update: As that graph shows, this is the second time this year that the index has fallen below the break-even mark Europe\u2019s stock markets have continued to slide today, as China\u2019s stock market rout overnight reverberates through global trading floor. I can\u2019t quite believe this is true. But there are reports that Greece\u2019s creditors are being rebadged as the Quadriga, to reflect the fact that the ESM is joining the Troika. In classical times, the quadriga was a four-horse chariot used for racing -- or even driven by the goddess Nike. You may have seen one in Berlin.... Greece\u2019s opposition parties were quick to criticise Varoufakis over his work on a parallel payment system, and are seeking answers. The Financial Times has the details: The centre-right opposition New Democracy party demanded that the government \u201ccome up with convincing answers for the Greek people . . . to shed light on this dark narrative\u201d. To Potami, a small centre-left party, said the former finance minister\u2019s plan was \u201creminiscent of a bad thriller\u201d. Having endured endless eurozone meetings over the Greek crisis this year, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister is unamused by today\u2019s disclosures from Yanis Varoufakis: And here\u2019s the official statement from James Galbraith, the US economist who worked with Varoufakis on his continency plan: I spent five months from early February through early July in close association with the Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and was part of the Working Group that did contingency planning for potential attempts to asphyxiate the Greek government, including aggressive moves to force the country out of the euro. Since a great deal of public confusion has now arisen over this effort, the following should be stated: At no time was the Working Group engaged in advocating exit or any policy choice. The job was strictly to study the operational issues that would arise if Greece were forced to issue scrip or if it were forced out of the euro. The group operated under the axiom that the government was fully committed to negotiating within the euro, and took extreme precautions not to jeopardize that commitment by allowing any hint of our work to reach the outside world. There were no leaks whatever, until the existence of the group was disclosed by the former Finance Minister himself, in response to criticism that his ministry had made no contingency plans when it was known that forces within the Eurozone were planning the forced exit of Greece. The existence of preliminary plans could not play any role in the Greek negotiating position, since their circulation (before there was a need to implement them) would have destabilized government policy. Apart from one late, inconclusive telephone conversation between MP Costas Lapavitsas and myself, we had no coordination with the Left Platform and our Working Group\u2019s ideas had little in common with theirs. Our work ended for practical purposes in early May, with a long memorandum outlining major issues and scenaria that we studied. My work in this area was unpaid and unofficial, based on my friendship with Yanis Varoufakis and on my respect for the cause of the Greek people. Point 4 appears to refer to the revelation that Syriza\u2019s Left Platform hatched a plan to return to the drachma, after last month\u2019s Euro summit where the bailout plan was agreed. Yanis Varoufakis has just released a statement defending his work creating a parallel payment system during his time as finance minister. The statement, from \u201cthe Office of Yanis Varoufakis\u201d, insists that he was fully authorised to carry out the work. It also criticises the media for their \u201cfar-fetched\u201d articles, and denies the claim that he ever planned to hijack all taxpayers tax file numbers [which he does not actually say on the leaked Tapes]. Here\u2019s the full statement: During the Greek government\u2019s negotiations with the Eurogroup, Minister Varoufakis oversaw a Working Group with a remit to prepare contingency plans against the creditors\u2019 efforts to undermine the Greek government and in view of forces at work within the Eurozone to have Greece expelled from the euro. The Working Group was convened by the Minister, at the behest of the Prime Minister, and was coordinated by Professor James K. Galbraith [who has issued his own statement] It is worth nothing (he means noting) that, prior to Mr Varoufakis\u2019 comfirmation of the existence of the said Working Group, the Minister was criticized widely for having neglected to make such contingency plans. The Bank of Greece, the ECB, treasuries of EU member-states, banks, international organisations etc. had all drawn up such plans since 2012. Greece\u2019s Ministry of Finance would have been remiss had it made no attempt to draw up contingency plans. Ever since Mr Varoufakis announced the existence of the Working Group, the media have indulged in far-fetched articles that damage the quality of public debate. The Ministry of Finance\u2019s Working Group worked exclusively within the framework of government policy and its recommendations were always aimed at serving the public interest, at respecting the laws of the land, and at keeping the country in the Eurozone. Regarding the recent article by \u201cKathimerini\u201d newspaper entitled \u201cPlan B involving highjacking and hacking\u201d, Kathimerini\u2019s failure to contact Mr Varoufakis for comment and its reporter\u2019s erroneous references to \u201chighjacking tax file numbers of all taxpayers\u201d sowed confusion and contributed to the media-induced disinformation. The article refers to the Ministry\u2019s project as described by Minister Varoufakis in his 6th July farewell speech during the handover ceremony in the Ministry of Finance. In that speech Mr Varoufakis clearly stated: \u201cThe General Secretariat of Information Systems had begun investigating means by which Taxisnet (Nb. the Ministry\u2019s Tax Web Interface) could become something more than it currently is, to become a payments system for third parties, a system that improves efficiency and minimises the arrears of the state to citizens and vice versa.\u201d That project was not part of the Working Group\u2019s remit, was presented in full by Minister Varoufakis to Cabinet, and should, in Minister Varoufakis\u2019 view, be implemented independently of the negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors, as it will contribute considerable efficiency gains in transactions between the state and taxpayers as well as between taxpayers. In conclusion, during the five months of negotiations that gripped Europe and changed the debate throughout the Continent, the Ministry of Finance did everything possible to serve the public interest against many odds. The current media campaign to besmirch these efforts will fail to dent the legacy of a crucial five month struggle for democracy and common sense. Another point about the Varoufakis Tapes -- this call took place under Chatham House rules, which means that the details can\u2019t be reported by the participants. However, Greek newspaper Kathimerini published large details of the transcript yesterday, prompting OMFIF to released the full recording today. It\u2019s not clear how Kathimerini got hold of the tapes. Over in Athens prime minister Alexis Tsipras marks six months in office today with his party divided and almost every promise he ever made overturned. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports Alexis Tsipras\u2019 political dexterity will be tested again this afternoon when he presides over a critical meeting of his Syriza\u2019s party\u2019s political secretariat. It will not be easy. The coalition of the radical left (if that is what Syriza can now be called) is in shellshock over Tsipras\u2019 embrace of the neo-liberal policies he had once so stridently opposed, in return for talks on a third bailout.` The argument that no plausible alternative exists is not washing with hardliners who will be in attendance. Indicative of that stance, the Left Platform\u2019s website, ISKRA (so named for the paper set up in exile by Vladimir Lenin) has declared \u201cthe battle continues\u201d with hardliners drawing their line in the sand. Tellingly, at the same time that Tsipras attempts to win over his doubting comrades, the Left Platform\u2019s leader Panagiotis Lafazanis will be addressing supporters at a separate rally (in celebration of ISKRA\u2019s fifth anniversary) under the banner: \u201cNo has not been defeated. We are continuing.\u201d Tsipras is in effect overseeing a minority government, given that a third of his MPs are no longer prepared to endorse EU-IMF mandated reforms. Pressure is now building on Syriza\u2019s dissidents to step down. Over the weekend, several of his closest allies, including minister of state Nikos Pappas, threw down the gauntlet saying the time had come for the rebels to either back the government or leave. Speaking on behalf of the hardliners, Lafazanis has repeatedly ruled out resigning saying that it is they who have remained faithful to the party\u2019s pre-electoral commitments. \u201cIn no way do I seek the break-up of Syriza, I am a founding member of Syriza,\u201d Lafazanis told media outlets on Sunday. \u201cWhat I want is for the new memorandum [outlining the tough terms of further financial assistance] to be cancelled and for Syriza to not be transformed into a memorandum force like New Democracy and Pasok. I will support the government in the implementation of the radical programme with which it was elected.\u201d Tsipras is expected this afternoon to ram home the message that with Greece\u2019s exit from the euro zone presaging assured catastrophe, a third bailout is the only option. \u201cWe will demand a central committee party convention,\u201d said one well-placed source who now aligns with the hardliners. \u201cTsipras won\u2019t want that because the central committee [Syriza\u2019s governing body] is against the measures but that is what we will do.\u201d Insiders say Tsipras has a road-map of sorts \u2013 one that starts with the new loan agreement being negotiated by August 18, Syriza calling an urgent party conference (which would deal with dissidents) at the end of September and elections being held on November 8. A new election could give young leader a new mandate to enforce controversial reforms. But much, in the meantime, will rest on the prime minister retaining control of his party. If he loses it altogether anything could happen. One important point on the Varoufakis Tapes - this call with top fund managers at OMFIF took place on 16 July. That\u2019s 10 days after he resigned, and three days after EU summit where Greece caved in and accepted unprecedented and sweeping austerity measures, easing fears that it could leave the single currency. The IMF has confirmed that technical talks over Greece\u2019s new bailout are getting underway. A Fund spokesperson says: \u201cA technical team will start work in Athens on Monday to take stock of recent developments.\u201d The mission chiefs, though, may not arrive for several days. Reuters reports that they are due \u201cby Friday\u201d. Heads-up: Paul Mason, Channel 4\u2019s economics editor, is ready to take your questions: FastFT are also transcribing the Varoufakis tapes - here\u2019s the section where the former finance minister told a group of hedge fund manager about his plan for a parallel banking system: We did have a plan B but the problem was to go from the five people who were planning it to the thousands that would have to implement it. The prime minister, before he became prime minister, had given me the green light to come up with a Plan B. I assembled a very able team, a small small team under wraps for obvious reasons. The difficulty was going from the five people who planned it to the 1000 that would be implementing it. For that i had to receive another authorization that never came. There is the website of the tax office where citizens go and use their tax file number and transfer monies to their tax. We were planning to create surreptitiously reserve accounts attached to every tax file number without telling anyone. At the touch of the button to allow us to give Pin numbers to tax payers so when the state owed, say, \u20ac1m to a pharmaceutical company, we could create a digital transfer, and a Pin. That would have created a parallel system so while the banks were shut thanks to the ECB\u2019s aggressive action, it would give us some breathing space. This was very well developed. We could have extended it using apps on smart phones and it could have become a functioning parallel system. it would have been euro denominated but it could have been transferred to drachma at the touch of a button. So as explained earlier, Varoufakis took matters into his own hands: We decided to hack into my minister\u2019s own software programme to copy the code of the tax system\u2019s website onto a large computer in his office so he could work out how to design this parallel payments system. We were ready to get the green light from the prime minister when the banks closed. Having explained his secret plan for a parallel banking system to top financiers, Yanis Varoufakis went on to warn that the French government is \u201cterrified\u201d of the austerity demanded by Germany. He explained that Paris is playing for time, in the face of Berlin\u2019s push for closer fiscal union. The French are terrified. They are terrified because they know that if they\u2019re going to shrink their budget deficit to the levels that Berlin demands, the Parisan government will certainly fall. There is no way that they can politically handle the kind of austerity that is demanded by Berlin. Varoufakis then explains how Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has outlined to him his plan to reshape the eurozone, to add more political union to make it sustainable. And, Varoufakis added, Sch\u00e4uble believes that a Grexit will equip him with: sufficient terrorising power to impose on Paris what the French are resisting, which is a degree of budget-making powers from Paris to Brussels. This recording of Yanis Varoufakis briefing top financiers about the Greek crisis is unmissable. Around 12 minutes in, he talks about the major tussle between the European Stability Mechanism, European Commission, IMF and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. There is a complete lack of coordination between the creditors, Varoufakis tells former UK chancellor Norman Lamont (and others on the call). Wolfgang has quite clearly said to me that he wants Grexit. He clearly believes that this extend and pretend is unacceptable. This is the one point where we see eye to eye - I agree with him, but for completely different reasons. The IMF does not want an agreement because it does not want to violate its charter again to provide new loans to a country whose debt is unviable. The Commission really wants the deal to go ahead, Merkel wants this deal to go ahead. Who\u2019d like to hear Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s former finance minister, telling fund managers about his secret plan to create a parallel payment system? Well, it\u2019s your lucky day. The Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum has just released the recording of Varoufakis explaining how he was authorised to create Plan B in case negotiations failed. As Kathimerini first reported yesterday, Varoufakis explains how he engaged a childhood friend to help, but found that \u201cthe General Secretary of Public Revenues within my ministry is controlled fully and directly by the troika.\u201d It was not under control of my ministry, of me as minister, it was controlled by Brussels. The general secretary is appointed effectively through a process which is troika-controlled and the whole mechanism within. It\u2019s like the Inland Revenue in the UK being controlled by Brussels. So.... \u201cwe decided to hack into my ministry\u2019s own software program\u201d....to be ready for when Greece\u2019s banks were closed by the European Central Bank. Varoufakis cautioned his listeners to keep this to themselves, adding: And even if they do [tell anyone]... I will deny I said it. Good luck with that.... Varoufakis also warns that the current bailout deal is not viable, and claims that German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is \u201chell-bent\u201d on engineering Grexit. Analysts have long suspected that Greece\u2019s banking sector suffered a large drop in deposits last month, and now we have the evidence. New data from the ECB has shown that Greek savers pulled another \u20ac8bn out of their accounts as the country staggered towards the end of its old bailout. That\u2019s a sharp acceleration on the \u20ac3.7bn taken out in May, and means deposits are at a new 11-year low. Speculation is growing that the Greek stock market might reopen on Tuesday, more than four weeks after capital controls were imposed: The falling oil price has helped to drag Bloomberg\u2019s commodity price index to a new 13-year low: The oil price has been hit by fears over the global economy today. Brent crude is down 0.5% to $54.27 per barrel, the lowest since early April. Today\u2019s selloff will force the Chinese government to take new measures to prop up its stock market, according to analysts at Citi: The Chinese market rout comes as investors ponder whether the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September, or hold on until perhaps December, points out Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale: It\u2019s taken a single day\u2019s trading to wipe out two weeks\u2019 worth of bounce in the Shanghai composite equity index. We were \u2018supposed\u2019 be be focusing on the US and the \u2018will they/won\u2019t they hike in September\u2019 debate by now, but China/commodities have yet again muddied the waters. Chinese investors are nursing some very heavy losses today, and must also be fearing more turmoil when markets reopen on Tuesday. Reuters reports that 1,500 individual shares were suspended after crashing 10% - the maximum allowed \u2013 fuelling fears that a a full-blown crash is building. Very few stock markets have avoided being dragged down today, either in Asia or Europe. Amateur chartists in the audience may see some similarities between today\u2019s slump and the events of 2007 and 2008: Here\u2019s confirmation that China\u2019s main stock markets just suffered its biggest selloff since the dawn of the credit crunch over eight years ago. Germany appears to have taken the Greek debt crisis in its stride, with business confidence rising this month. The IFO thinktank\u2019s monthly business climate survey ticked up to 108 this month, up from 107.5 in June. Firms reported an improvement in current conditions, and are slightly more optimistic about future prospects. It appears that the underlying strength of Europe\u2019s largest economy helped it to defy the turmoil in Athens in recent months. Carsten Brzeski, ING economists, says: Even if the doses has been reduced somewhat, the German economy is still on steroids. Despite some recent rebounds, the weak euro exchange rate and low energy prices are still artificially extending the last phase of a very positive reform-growth cycle. Europe\u2019s stock markets are also suffering a bout of Greek worries, after talks with creditors had a false start on Friday (but should start today or tomorrow). Sunday\u2019s revelations about plans for a secret parallel payment system haven\u2019t calmed nerves either, as Connor Campbell of SpreadEX explains: The Eurozone indices weren\u2019t helped by the weekend\u2019s news that Yanis Varoufakis, at the behest of Tsipras, spent months working on a parallel banking system that, for all intents and purposes, would have dealt with an abrupt switch from euro to drachma; an unwelcome reminder as negotiations begin of the Grexit-stakes that lie at the heart of the saga. Here\u2019s our take on the story: Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of the Telegraph has spoken with Varoufakis, who confirmed the story but denied that he\u2019d been plotting Greece\u2019s exit from the eurozone. Europe\u2019s stock markets have followed China\u2019s lead, with the French CAC and German DAX both falling over 1%. The FTSE 100 is only down 0.35%, though, with mining stocks recovering after Friday\u2019s rout. Here\u2019s another reason for alarm: the amount of capital leaving China has accelerated sharply in recent months. That indicates companies are investing less, suggesting economic growth is faltering. Chinese share prices were a sea of green today (red, being a lucky colour, is used for rising prices): Andrew MacFarlane of BNP Paribas says today\u2019s slump shows \u201cthe vulnerability of the Chinese market despite the recent government support.\u201d Today\u2019s crash comes three weeks after China took dramatic action to stem falling prices. In a remarkable intervention, Beijing banned large shareholders from selling stakes, ordered state-run institutions to buy shares and letting many companies halt trading in their shares. My colleague Nils Pratley covered it here: In the short term, China\u2019s actions did help the Shanghai stock market to recover: But that sticking-plaster appears to be coming off. On Friday, it emerged that the International Monetary Fund was pushing China to unwind its intervention, so that market forces could set the true price of shares. That may now be underway... Analysts are struggling to explain exactly why the Chinese stock markets suffered such a slump. Reuters attributes it to \u201cprofit-taking, concerns over economic health and fears of an end to Beijing\u2019s inclination toward looser monetary policies.\u201d Many stocks on the Shanghai stock market were suspended after plunging 10%, which is the maximum allowed in one day. Only four stocks rose, out of 300. The Chinese stock market has suffered its worst one-day fall in eight years, after a day of panic selling. The benchmark Shanghai composite index just crashed by 8.5%, which is the biggest one-day fall since 2007, according to Bloomberg data. The slump was triggered by worries over the Chinese economy, with a new survey showing that profit at China\u2019s industrial firms fell by 0.3% last month. But the scale of the rout suggests investors are also losing faith in recent efforts by the Beijing government to prop up share prices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. With Greece temporarily on the back-burner (but not for long), China has elbowed its way to the forefront of investors\u2019 attention, on fears that its economy is suffering a serious slowdown. And the Chinese stock markets is suffering a bad day. The benchmark Shanghai index is has slumped by around 7% in late trading, in another rush of late selling. That\u2019s likely to hit Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning too. Also coming up today Negotiators from Greece\u2019s creditors are due to arrive in Athens today formally begin talks on a \u20ac86bn bailout, after talks were aborted on Friday due to a row over access to ministries - and which hotel would house the Troika. We find out how much damage the Greek crisis has caused to Germany\u2019s economy, when the IFO index is released at 9am. And Greeks are also digesting the news that former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis spent months on a plan to develop a parallel banking system while in office. Sunday\u2019s edition of the Greek newspaper Kathimerini has the story. Varoufakis claims had approval to plan parallel banking system Here\u2019s a flavour: Former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis has claimed that he was authorized by Alexis Tsipras last December to look into a parallel payment system that would operate using wiretapped tax registration numbers (AFMs) and could eventually work as a parallel banking system, Kathimerini has learned. In a teleconference call with members of international hedge funds that was allegedly coordinated by former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont, Varoufakis claimed to have been given the okay by Tsipras last December \u2013 a month before general elections that brought SYRIZA to power \u2013 to plan a payment system that could operate in euros but which could be changed into drachmas \u201covernight\u201d if necessary, Kathimerini understands. Lamont\u2019s involvement is the icing on a particularly eye-catching cake. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

The job was strictly to study the operational issues that would arise if Greece were forced to issue scrip or if it were forced out of the euro.</li> <li>The group operated under the axiom that the government was fully committed to negotiating within the euro, and took extreme precautions not to jeopardize that commitment by allowing any hint of our work to reach the outside world. There were no leaks whatever, until the existence of the group was disclosed by the former Finance Minister himself, in response to criticism that his ministry had made no contingency plans when it was known that forces within the Eurozone were planning the forced exit of Greece.</li> <li>The existence of preliminary plans could not play any role in the Greek negotiating position, since their circulation (before there was a need to implement them) would have destabilized government policy.</li> <li>Apart from one late, inconclusive telephone conversation between MP Costas Lapavitsas and myself, we had no coordination with the Left Platform and our Working Group\u2019s ideas had little in common with theirs.</li> <li>Our work ended for practical purposes in early May, with a long memorandum outlining major issues and scenaria that we studied.</li> <li>My work in this area was unpaid and unofficial, based on my friendship with Yanis Varoufakis and on my respect for the cause of the Greek people.</li> </ol> </ol> <p>Point 4 appears to refer to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2a0a1d94-3201-11e5-8873-775ba7c2ea3d.html\">the revelation that Syriza\u2019s Left Platform hatched a plan to return to the drachma, after last month\u2019s Euro summit where the bailout plan was agreed</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55b62a1ae4b09cde8f9eba3d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-27T13:05:51.189Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Varoufakis issues statement defending contingency plan</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"33f44941b6950583dcd6b7bf33559a6492251f4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33f44941b6950583dcd6b7bf33559a6492251f4a/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(FILES) -- A file photo taken on March 4, 2015 shows then Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis arriving to present his ministry\u2019s new secretaries at a press conference in Athens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Yanis Varoufakis has just released a statement defending his work creating a parallel payment system during his time as finance minister.</strong></p> <p>The statement, from \u201cthe Office of Yanis Varoufakis\u201d, insists that he was fully authorised to carry out the work. <br></p> <p>It also criticises the media for their \u201cfar-fetched\u201d articles, and denies the claim that he ever planned to hijack all taxpayers tax file numbers [<em>which he does not actually say on the leaked Tapes</em>].<br></p> <h2>Here\u2019s the full statement:</h2> <p>During the Greek government\u2019s negotiations with the Eurogroup, Minister Varoufakis oversaw a Working Group with a remit to prepare contingency plans against the creditors\u2019 efforts to undermine the Greek government and in view of forces at work within the Eurozone to have Greece expelled from the euro. The Working Group was convened by the Minister, at the behest of the Prime Minister, and was coordinated by Professor James K. Galbraith [<em>who has<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/27/business-live-chinese-stock-market-rout-ftse-greece-live#block-55b62cb1e4b0221a8b9d3159\"> issued his own statement</a></em>]</p> <p>It is worth nothing (<em>he means noting</em>) that, prior to Mr Varoufakis\u2019 comfirmation of the existence of the said Working Group, the Minister was criticized widely for having neglected to make such contingency plans. The Bank of Greece, the ECB, treasuries of EU member-states, banks, international organisations etc. had all drawn up such plans since 2012. Greece\u2019s Ministry of Finance would have been remiss had it made no attempt to draw up contingency plans.</p> <p>Ever since Mr Varoufakis announced the existence of the Working Group, the media have indulged in far-fetched articles that damage the quality of public debate. The Ministry of Finance\u2019s Working Group worked exclusively within the framework of government policy and its recommendations were always aimed at serving the public interest, at respecting the laws of the land, and at keeping the country in the Eurozone.</p> <p>Regarding the recent article by \u201cKathimerini\u201d newspaper entitled \u201cPlan B involving highjacking and hacking\u201d, Kathimerini\u2019s failure to contact Mr Varoufakis for comment and its reporter\u2019s erroneous references to \u201chighjacking tax file numbers of all taxpayers\u201d sowed confusion and contributed to the media-induced disinformation. The article refers to the Ministry\u2019s project as described by Minister Varoufakis in his 6<sup>th</sup> July farewell speech during the handover ceremony in the Ministry of Finance. In that speech <a href=\"http://www.mnec.gr/?q=el/news/statements/%CE%BF%CE%B9-%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82-%CE%B3-%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%86%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CE%B5%CF%85-%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%AC-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B2%CE%AE-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CF%85%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85\">Mr Varoufakis clearly stated</a>: \u201cThe General Secretariat of Information Systems had begun investigating means by which Taxisnet (Nb. the Ministry\u2019s Tax Web Interface) could become something more than it currently is, to become a payments system for third parties, a system that improves efficiency and minimises the arrears of the state to citizens and vice versa.\u201d</p> <p>That project was <em>not</em> part of the Working Group\u2019s remit, was presented in full by Minister Varoufakis to Cabinet, and should, in Minister Varoufakis\u2019 view, be implemented independently of the negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors, as it will contribute considerable efficiency gains in transactions between the state and taxpayers as well as between taxpayers.</p> <p>In conclusion, during the five months of negotiations that gripped Europe and changed the debate throughout the Continent, the Ministry of Finance did everything possible to serve the public interest against many odds. The current media campaign to besmirch these efforts will fail to dent the legacy of a crucial five month struggle for democracy and common sense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/statuses/625648732969795584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Statement by Yanis Varoufakis on the FinMin\u2019s Plan B Working Group &amp; the parallel payment system <a href=\"http://t.co/9JTWNyq8JK\">http://t.co/9JTWNyq8JK</a></p>&mdash; Yanis Varoufakis (@yanisvaroufakis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/625648732969795584\">July 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-27T13:48:45.287Z\">at 2.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55b62862e4b09cde8f9eba35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-27T12:52:42.296Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/27/business-live-chinese-stock-market-rout-ftse-greece-live#block-55b60ab0e4b09cde8f9eb99f\">Another point about the Varoufakis Tapes</a> -- this call took place under Chatham House rules, which means that the details can\u2019t be reported by the participants.</strong></p> <p>However, Greek newspaper Kathimerini published large details of the transcript yesterday, prompting OMFIF to released the full recording today.

Indicative of that stance, the Left Platform\u2019s website, ISKRA (<em>so named for the paper set up in exile by Vladimir Lenin</em>) has declared \u201cthe battle continues\u201d with hardliners drawing their line in the sand.</p> <p>Tellingly, at the same time that Tsipras attempts to win over his doubting comrades, the Left Platform\u2019s leader Panagiotis Lafazanis will be addressing supporters at a separate rally (in celebration of ISKRA\u2019s fifth anniversary) under the banner:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cNo has not been defeated. We are continuing.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Tsipras is in effect overseeing a minority government, given that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/23/greece-debt-crisis-vote-clears-way-for-bailout-talks\">a third of his MPs are no longer prepared to endorse EU-IMF mandated reforms</a>. Pressure is now building on Syriza\u2019s dissidents to step down. </p> <p>Over the weekend, several of his closest allies, including minister of state <strong>Nikos Pappas</strong>, threw down the gauntlet saying the time had come for the rebels to either back the government or leave. Speaking on behalf of the hardliners, Lafazanis has repeatedly ruled out resigning saying that it is they who have remained faithful to the party\u2019s pre-electoral commitments.</p> <p>\u201cIn no way do I seek the break-up of Syriza, I am a founding member of Syriza,\u201d Lafazanis told media outlets on Sunday.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWhat I want is for the new memorandum [outlining the tough terms of further financial assistance] to be cancelled and for Syriza to not be transformed into a memorandum force like New Democracy and Pasok. I will support the government in the implementation of the radical programme with which it was elected.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Tsipras is expected this afternoon to ram home the message that with Greece\u2019s exit from the euro zone presaging assured catastrophe, a third bailout is the only option. \u201cWe will demand a central committee party convention,\u201d said one well-placed source who now aligns with the hardliners.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cTsipras won\u2019t want that because the central committee [Syriza\u2019s governing body] is against the measures but that is what we will do.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Insiders say Tsipras has a road-map of sorts \u2013 one that starts with the new loan agreement being negotiated by August 18, Syriza calling an urgent party conference (which would deal with dissidents) at the end of September and elections being held on <strong>November 8. </strong></p> <p>A new election could give young leader a new mandate to enforce controversial reforms.</p> <p><strong>But much, in the meantime, will rest on the prime minister retaining control of his party.

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has been thrust back in the spotlight as he vigorously defended plans to launch a parallel payment system in the event of the country being ejected from the euro. Saying it would have been \u201cremiss\u201d of him not to have a \u201cplan B\u201d if negotiations with the country\u2019s creditors had collapsed, the outspoken politician admitted that a small team under his control had devised a parallel payment system. The secret scheme would have eased the way to the return of the nation\u2019s former currency, the drachma. \u201cGreece\u2019s ministry of finance would have been remiss had it made no attempt to draw up contingency plans,\u201d he said in a statement. But Varoufakis, who resigned earlier this month to facilitate talks between Athens\u2019 left-led government and its creditors, denied that the group had worked as a rogue element outside government policy or beyond the confines of the law. \u201cThe ministry of finance\u2019s working group worked exclusively within the framework of government policy and its recommendations were always aimed at serving the public interest, at respecting the laws of the land, and at keeping the country in the Eurozone,\u201d the statement said. Earlier on Monday the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, which had organized a conference call between Varoufakis and investors, released a recording of the conversation held between the former minister and financial professionals on 16 July . Varoufakis is heard saying that he ordered the ministry\u2019s own software programme to be hacked so that online tax codes could be copied to \u201cwork out\u201d how the payment system could be designed. \u201cWe were planning to create, surrepticiously, reserve accounts attached to every tax file number, without telling anyone, just to have this system in a function under wraps,\u201d he says, adding that he had appointed a childhood friend to help him carry out the plan. \u201cWe were ready to get the green light from the PM when the banks closed.\u201d The plan was denounced by Greek opposition parties, which in recent weeks have called for Varoufakis to be put on trial for treason. The academic-turned-politician has been blamed heavily for the handling of negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors \u2013 the European Central Bank, European commission and Internatonal Monetary Fund \u2013 which saw Greece come close to leaving the eurozone. The small centre-left Potami party said the scheme was \u201creminiscent of a bad thriller.\u201d The main opposition New Democracy party demanded that the government \u201ccome up with convincing answers for the Greek people \u2026 so that light can be shed on this dark narrative.\u201d Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Petar Kazimar went further, savaging Varoufakis\u2019 \u201ctwo faced games.\u201d In a series of tweets he wrote: \u201cUnveiled plans by #Greece ex-FinMin Varoufakis to return to drachma during ongoing talks with us show how unpredictable he was as a partner\u201d. \u201cWe need to make sure such two-faced \u2018games\u2019 will be avoided when debating&amp;drafting the third bailout package for #Greece#ECB#Eurozone\u201d. Varoufakis, who once proposed wiring up tourists in a bid to clamp down on tax evasion, denounced media accounts of skullduggery as far-fetched. In a tweet responding to a report revealing the plan in Sunday\u2019s conservative newspaper, Kathimerini, he tweeted: \u201cSo, I was going to \u2018hijack\u2019 Greek citizens\u2019 tax numbers? Impressed by my defamers\u2019 imagination.\u201d In the statement on Monday the politician insisted that under his stewardship the Greek finance ministry had not only served the public\u2019s interest \u201cagainst many odds\u201d but managed to change economic debate \u201cthroughout the continent.\u201d Since the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, caved into creditor demands at an EU summit on 12 July, more than a quarter of the 149 MPs in Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party have refused to endorse the sweeping austerity measures demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors in exchange for up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) in fresh bailout loans. Forced to push the policies through parliament with the help of the \u201cpro-European\u201d opposition, Tsipras\u2019s leftwing Syriza party is not only divided but bears little resemblance to the one he was catapulted into office with in January. Addressing Syriza\u2019s governing parliamentary secretariat late on Monday, the leader threw down the gauntlet challenging dissidents to come up with a better plan than the one he had been forced to accept to keep Greece in the euro. Rebels have refused to resign arguing they represent the true spirit of a party elevated into power to eradicate austerity. Insiders said Tsipras hoped to close negotiations with auditors \u2013 who formally launch an inspection tour of Greek finances on Tuesday \u2013 on a \u20ac12bn package of spending cuts and tax hikes Athens has agreed to enforce by 18 August, two days before a crucial ECB debt repayment. Once the bailout programme is sealed, he will tackle party infighting with an emergency conference that will attempt to purge Syriza of those who disagree with the policies before holding fresh elections in early November. Though increasingly at odds with his own MPs \u2013 starting with Varoufakis \u2013 Tsipras remains popular among Greeks who admire what is perceived as his robust defense of their rights. A second election victory in a year would give Tsipras the mandate to implement the controversial reforms he had once so stringently opposed.",

    "webTitle": "Can Philadelphia barbershops help increase black voter turnout?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Duerward Beale goes to his local barbershop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, two or three times a month. For Beale \u2013 known as \u201cWoody\u201d to his friends \u2013 the barbershop trip is not just a quick in-and-out appointment. Instead, the visit often spans hours, packed with conversation. Working with local media partners and 50 barbers across Philadelphia, Beale is hoping to use the hours that black men spend in their local barbershops to increase black voter turnout. Voter turnout in Philadelphia, also known as the City of Brotherly Love, has been on an increasingly downward trajectory \u2013 with the exception of 2008, when then-Senator Barack Obama received 99% of the vote or more in 13 wards. According to Beale, this reduction in voter participation is partly due to disillusionment in local communities. Philadelphians struggle with higher unemployment than the rest of the nation, misinformation about political processes, and mistrust in the system, especially by many black male residents, many of whom are out on parole or just returning home from serving time. To tackle these issues, Beale wants to recruit and train barbers to help cut through some of the mistrust. On Tuesday, his plan \u2013 officially known as Sharp Insight \u2013 came closer to becoming reality when it was awarded $250,000 by the Knight Foundation. Barbershops: heart of the community? \u201cYou name it, we talk about it in the barbershop. We feel comfortable in barbershops to have an opinion,\u201d Beale said. \u201cOn any given busy day, you might see 15 to 20 people in a barbershop while you are waiting for two or three hours to get your haircut. So it gives you a greater opportunity to engage people or to talk to people.\u201d His plan calls for barbers to be trained in a workshop held by the Philadelphia\u2019s Youth Outreach Adolescent Community Awareness Program (YOACAP) to answer questions about who is eligible to vote, as well as to provide facts about the 2016 elections. Beale is the executive director of YOACAP, which has been around since 1988 and focuses on community outreach, education workshops and after-school programs. Its target demographic is Philadelphians between 15 and 34 years old. This is not the first YOACAP outreach effort based on barbershops. In the past, YOACAP went into barbershops and beauty salons to register eligible voters. Using a barbershop to disseminate information for the benefit of the public is also not new. Los Angeles barbers have been trained to measure blood pressure to help fight hypertension. In England, hairdressers are being trained to raise awareness about climate change and the environment. According to Beale, barbers are interested in such programs because they are stakeholders in their communities. Even those who don\u2019t have their own shops can still rent a chair and maintain their own set of clients. \u201cPeople respect that,\u201d Beale said. \u201cThey are usually from a neighborhood where a lot of people know them.\u201d Sharp Insight has historically focused on outreach efforts around measuring high blood pressure and increasing awareness about sexually transmitted diseases. The company\u2019s latest proposal would track the impact that barbers trained in electoral issues have on their customer base and their communities. \u201cThe proposal blends the everyday setting of a barbershop with information-sharing, making civic participation a routine part of daily life,\u201d said John Bracken, the Knight Foundation\u2019s vice president for media innovation. Sharp Insight is one of 22 projects selected by the Knight Foundation as winners of its Knight News Challenge on elections. The projects aim to tackle electoral and civic challenges by making it easier to request absentee ballots with smartphones, creating affordable and accurate alternatives to exit polling, creating a public library of political ads from key 2016 primary election states, and making a searchable archive of campaign speech transcripts. Others tackle issues like dark money \u2013 unlimited donations to nonprofits that can spend money to influence elections but aren\u2019t required to identify their donors \u2013 and restoring voting rights of those with prior felony convictions. \u201cThe winners leverage elections as the best opportunity for Americans to shape policy and reimagine their shared future,\u201d Bracken said. Philadelphia\u2019s disillusioned black men Beale hopes the future holds higher voter turnout among black men in Philadelphia. According to The New York Times, Philadelphia is the third in the nation when it comes to \u201cmissing\u201d black men, either killed at a young age or incarcerated. Trailing behind New York and Chicago, Philadelphia\u2019s 36,000 missing men account for almost half of the black men in the city. The program will focus largely on black men in Philadelphia, many of whom are on parole or are just coming home from being incarcerated, according to Beale. In addition to being confused about whether they qualify to vote, these men are often disillusioned with the US political system. \u201c[They] just have a mistrust of the system, of elected officials because they feel like elected officials have an agenda,\u201d Beale said. \u201cThey are nervous voting for the people they don\u2019t really know about. Often times, they just won\u2019t go. \u2018I am not doing that. It doesn\u2019t make sense. I don\u2019t know who to vote for. I\u2019ll wait for the next one.\u2019 If you sit there and listen to what they are saying, a lot of it is, they don\u2019t have information.\u201d To help get the word out about the program, Sharp Insight has partnered with iHeartMedia and Loraine Ballard Morrill, the media company\u2019s news and community affairs director for six Philadelphia radio stations. According to Morrill, Philadelphia communities rely on the radio for a lot of their news and view it as a trusted source of information. Through this partnership, she believes Sharp Insight will be able to send a message that will be heard. \u201cOne of the things that politicians rely on is the lack of voter participation,\u201d said Morrill, who is now also the news and community affairs director at Sharp Insight. \u201cSadly, here in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, many elected officials run unopposed and they do that because voter participation is low. Sometimes people get elected into office by as little as 2,000 votes. And that\u2019s not a good thing for our political process \u2013 for our democratic process.\u201d This year, during the city\u2019s mayoral primary, just 27% of registered voters came to the polls. The voter turnout for mayoral elections has been on a downward slide for over four decades, with turnout dropping from 77% in 1971 to 67% in 1987 to 49% in 1991. Beale hopes that his small army of barbers will begin to reverse that trend, one shave at a time.",

      "body": "<p>Duerward Beale goes to his local barbershop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, two or three times a month. For Beale \u2013 known as \u201cWoody\u201d to his friends \u2013 the barbershop trip is not just a quick in-and-out appointment. Instead, the visit often spans hours, packed with conversation.</p> <p>Working with local media partners and 50 barbers across Philadelphia, Beale is hoping to use the hours that black men spend in their local barbershops to increase black voter turnout.</p> <p>Voter turnout in Philadelphia, also known as the City of Brotherly Love, has been on an increasingly downward trajectory \u2013 with the exception of 2008, when then-Senator Barack Obama <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2012-11-09/news/34995157_1_voter-turnout-president-obama-gop-voters\">received 99% of the vote or more in 13 wards</a>. According to Beale, this reduction in voter participation is partly due to disillusionment in local communities. Philadelphians struggle with <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/news-release/unemployment_philadelphia.htm\">higher unemployment than the rest of the nation</a>, misinformation about political processes, and mistrust in the system, especially by many black male residents, many of whom are out on parole or just returning home from serving time. </p> <p>To tackle these issues, Beale wants to recruit and train barbers to help cut through some of the mistrust. On Tuesday, his plan \u2013 officially known as Sharp Insight \u2013 came closer to becoming reality when it was awarded $250,000 by the Knight Foundation.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Barbershops: heart of the community?</h2> <p>\u201cYou name it, we talk about it in the barbershop. We feel comfortable in barbershops to have an opinion,\u201d Beale said. \u201cOn any given busy day, you might see 15 to 20 people in a barbershop while you are waiting for two or three hours to get your haircut. So it gives you a greater opportunity to engage people or to talk to people.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/un-barbershop-conference-men-womens-rights\">UN Barbershop conference aims to get men talking about women's rights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His plan calls for barbers to be trained in a workshop held by the Philadelphia\u2019s Youth Outreach Adolescent Community Awareness Program (YOACAP) to answer questions about who is eligible to vote, as well as to provide facts about the 2016 elections.</p> <p>Beale is the executive director of YOACAP, which has been around since 1988 and focuses on community outreach, education workshops and after-school programs. Its target demographic is Philadelphians between 15 and 34 years old. This is not the first YOACAP outreach effort based on barbershops. In the past, YOACAP went into barbershops and beauty salons to register eligible voters.</p> <p>Using a barbershop to disseminate information for the benefit of the public is also not new. <strong> </strong> Los Angeles barbers have been trained to <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/shape-up-and-check-up-la-barbers-to-start-testing-blood-pressure/\">measure blood pressure to help fight hypertension</a>. In England, hairdressers are being trained to raise awareness<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/hair-salons-hairdressers-environment-education\"> about climate change and the environment</a>.</p> <p>According to Beale, barbers are interested in such programs because they are stakeholders in their communities. Even those who don\u2019t have their own shops can still rent a chair and maintain their own set of clients.</p> <p>\u201cPeople respect that,\u201d Beale said. \u201cThey are usually from a neighborhood where a lot of people know them.\u201d</p> <p>Sharp Insight has historically focused on outreach efforts around measuring high blood pressure and increasing awareness about sexually transmitted diseases. The company\u2019s latest proposal would track the impact that barbers trained in electoral issues have on their customer base and their communities. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cThe proposal blends the everyday setting of a barbershop with information-sharing, making civic participation a routine part of daily life,\u201d said John Bracken, the Knight Foundation\u2019s vice president for media innovation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/hair-salons-hairdressers-environment-education\">Can hair salons help save the environment?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/elections/feedback/sharp-insight-barbers-cutting-through-misinformation-and-lack-of-information-on-elections-for-black-men\">Sharp Insight</a> is one of 22 projects selected by the Knight Foundation as winners of its Knight News Challenge on elections.

      "bodyText": "Turmoil has returned to the Chinese stock market as shares suffered their worst fall in eight years, knocking commodity prices and fuelling jitters among investors in London. Following three weeks of relative calm, the Shanghai Composite Index plummeted on Monday, ending down 8.5% at 3725.56 \u2013 its worst fall since February 2007. Meanwhile the Shenzhen index dropped nearly 7.6% to close at 12493.05 points. Analysts predict more misery ahead for investors in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, commemorated the latest crash in a tweet that read: \u201cThe return of the debacle!\u201d Two-thirds of all companies listed on the Chinese mainland, or about 1,800 stocks, lost 10% of their value \u2013 the maximum daily limit \u2013 and were suspended. The latest nosedive also stoked wider fears about China, which have come to the fore recently with falls in the prices of commodities such as copper and gold. Copper prices tumbled to a six-year low on Monday as the latest slide in China\u2019s stock markets reinforced gloomy prospects for demand in the world\u2019s top consumer of the metal. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange earlier fell nearly 2% to $5,164 a tonne on Monday. A crucial announcement from the US Federal Reserve on the potential prospects for interest rates was also weighing on sentiment. The FTSE 100 index fell 1% and closed at 6,505 \u2013 below the 6,566 where it ended 2014 \u2013 and down on the high of 7,103 points it hit in April. The main indices in Germany and France were down more than 2.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average in New York was down 127.94 points, or 0.7%, to 17,440.59. \u201cDespite those recording breaking highs in the middle of April the FTSE is back at its 2015 starting point; the rampant optimism of the first few months of the year have all but been wiped out by the truly draining Greek saga and the embryonic crisis brewing in China,\u201d said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spreadbetter Spreadex. In China, the state-run Beijing News quoted one spooked investor \u2013 named only as Mr Wang \u2013 who joked that Monday\u2019s plunge was like \u201creturning to the time before Liberation\u201d in 1949. Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist for analysis firm IHS Global Insight, said the latest slump showed that Beijing\u2019s attempts to stabilise the stock market following the recent collapse, including extending massive loans to buy shares, were not paying off. \u201cThe government has been trying to hold back the tide like King Canute,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is now a stock market crisis and you can see from the responses that they have been making that they are not really sure how to address it. Today\u2019s developments are just going to put this even more at the centre of their economic problems.\u201d The latest day of frenzied selling \u2013 which analysts said reflected weaker economic data out of China as well as a lack of confidence in Beijing\u2019s response to ongoing stock market chaos \u2013 was a slap in the face for the country\u2019s Communist party leaders. Beijing launched an unprecedented push to prop up the country\u2019s stock market after a collapse that began in mid-June saw more than $3tn wiped off the value of listed companies. Until Monday, those efforts, which also included freezing IPOs, appeared to have brought some measure of stability. The Shanghai index had rebounded more than 15% from the worst levels of the crisis in early July. But in a note following the latest slump, analysts at consultancy Capital Economics wrote: \u201cThe lesson from China\u2019s last equity bubble is that, once sentiment has soured, policy interventions aimed at shoring up prices have only a short-lived effect.\u201d Biswas, the IHS economist, said Beijing\u2019s attempts to turn the situation around by intervening in the stock market were doomed to fail. \u201cIn my view they really have to now respond more forcefully with monetary and fiscal stimulus to try and get the economy on an upward track again. So instead of trying to address the stock market they need to address the real economy, which I think is the root problem right now that people perceive in China that the economy itself is struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to convince investors and consumers that the real economy is stabilising and is going to be improving. That has not happened yet. All the signals are convincing investors that the economy is on the way down and until that perception changes it is going to be very hard to put a floor under the stock market.\u201d Louis Tse, the director of Hong Kong\u2019s VC Brokerage, told the South China Morning Post: \u201cSentiment among investors is quite poor. They\u2019re selling stock to try to retrieve their money, especially from blue chips and in the A-share market when the Shanghai Composite reaches 4,000 points.\u201d Chinese investors took to social media to mourn their losses following the latest day of turmoil. \u201cPeople ask me how I feel about the fall,\u201d one investor wrote on Weibo, China\u2019s answer to Twitter. \u201cI have only these few words \u2013 I am used to it.\u201d Another panicky investor wrote: \u201cIf you stay in the market, you will lose all your money. Pull out now even if it means losing some.\u201d Additional reporting by Luna Lin",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned the eurozone faces a gloomy economic outlook thanks to lingering worries over Greece, high unemployment and a banking sector still battling to shake off the financial crisis. The IMF\u2019s latest healthcheck on the eurozone found it was \u201csusceptible to negative shocks\u201d as growth continues to falter and monetary policymakers run out of ways to help. It called for an urgent \u201ccollective push\u201d from the currency union to speed up reforms or else risk years of lost growth. \u201cA moderate shock to confidence \u2013 whether from lower expected future growth or heightened geopolitical tensions \u2013 could tip the bloc into prolonged stagnation,\u201d said Mahmood Pradhan, the IMF\u2019s mission chief for the eurozone. Near-term fillips such as the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) massive money-printing programme, low oil prices and a weak euro could only spur the economy for so long, IMF staff said after its annual discussions with eurozone policymakers. In the Fund\u2019s view the medium-term looks subdued because of \u201ca chronic lack of demand, impaired corporate and bank balance sheets, and deeply rooted structural weaknesses\u201d. The IMF\u2019s review said: \u201cThe recovery is strengthening, underpinned by lower oil prices and the ECB\u2019s expanded asset purchase programme. But the medium-term outlook remains weak, weighed down by the legacies of insufficient demand, lagging productivity, and weak bank and corporate balance sheets. \u201cAs one-off factors driving the cyclical recovery fade, there is a risk that low growth and limited policy space leave the euro area vulnerable to shocks.\u201d Stagnation worries The IMF \u201cmission\u201d to the eurozone took place between 18 May and 3 June, long before an apparent stopgap to the the Greek debt crisis was hammered out this month. Since that deal to start talks on a new bailout for Greece, the Washington-based Fund has been fiercely critical of what eurozone leaders have offered to Athens and has called for substantial debt relief. The Fund\u2019s eurozone report, published on Monday, described the situation in Greece as \u201cfluid\u201d and as still \u201ca key source of uncertainty\u201d. \u201cTo manage contagion risks, policymakers should stand ready to deploy, and if necessary adapt, the full arsenal of available instruments; the ECB in particular should ensure that banks continue to have access to ample liquidity and maintain orderly conditions in sovereign debt markets,\u201d the report said. It urged the ECB to stand ready to expand its quantitative easing (QE) programme, where it buys eurozone governments\u2019 bonds using electronically created money, if financial conditions get significantly tighter and also said the scheme might need to go beyond September 2016, currently pencilled in as the end-date. High unemployment The IMF is forecasting eurozone GDP growth of 1.5% this year and 1.7% next year. It expects inflation to remain close to zero this year and rise to 1.1%. The forecasters are gloomy about the prospects for a strengthening economy to lift employment in many eurozone countries. In the meantime, the unemployment rate remains high, above 11% for the whole eurozone and near 25% in Greece and Spain. \u201cThe share of long-term unemployed continues to increase, raising the risks of skill erosion and entrenched high unemployment. High youth unemployment could also damage potential human capital, and give rise to a \u201clost generation\u2019. While weak demand plays a major role, more spending on active labour market policies would help increase employment opportunities, especially for the young,\u201d the report notes. Bad loans The IMF\u2019s other policy recommendations include helping to clean up bank balance sheets, which have in many cases been left with non-performing, or \u201cbad\u201d, loans after the financial crisis where the borrowers are no longer keeping up interest payments. The Fund urges eurozone policymakers to do more, such as shake up insolvency rules, to get bad loans off banks\u2019 balance sheets and so free up the financial sector to lend more. Stronger banks would also amplify the benefits of QE, the report says. Benchmark or bust? The Fund also urges eurozone officials to find ways to better measure and encourage progress in areas of structural reform. For example, it wants the currency bloc to use benchmarks, such as how long it takes to launch a business or the number of days it takes to enforce a contract. \u201cShifting to outcome-based benchmarking, stronger EU oversight with less discretion in applying existing rules, and better financial incentives for delivering on reform commitments could help accelerate progress on reforms,\u201d the report says. In a plea to better-off members of the region, the IMF calls for more measures to stimulate demand. \u201cThose countries with fiscal space, including from lower interest costs due to QE, should use it to raise investment and pursue structural reforms,\u201d the report said.",

    "webTitle": "Ryanair takes aim at price comparison websites", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair is seeking to crush flight price comparison websites such as Expedia and Opodo, claiming they \u201cmake no sense\u201d and \u201cshouldn\u2019t exist\u201d. The airline\u2019s controversial boss, Michael O\u2019Leary, has written to four other leading airlines in Europe asking them to display each other\u2019s fares on their website, to circumvent the price comparison sites. He did not name the airlines, but they are understood to be IAG (British Airways/Iberia), Air France/KLM, Lufthansa and easyJet. \u201cI think it is something the big airlines could and should work together on because I think it makes no sense for third-party price comparison websites out there,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in a video statement. \u201cIf the airlines were competitive and had a competent digital offering those kind of websites shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d None of the airlines has responded to O\u2019Leary\u2019s suggestion. The statement came as Ryanair posted a 25% rise in quarterly profits, with rising passenger numbers attributed to its new approach to customer service. The number of customers jumped from 24.3m to 28m in the three months to June 30, 2015 while profits surged from \u20ac197m to \u20ac245m. Average fares fell to just \u20ac45 (\u00a332) as Ryanair used lower fuel costs to cut prices, while fewer customers paid to put their bags in the hold (or what it called \u201clower checked-bag penetration\u201d). The airline predicted that airfares will fall by 4-8% in the second half of 2015, as cheap fuel prompts a price war among European airlines. Ryanair has paid an average of $91 a barrel for forward-bought fuel for 2016, but has managed to cut that to $66 for 2017, saving it \u20ac250m. Next year it expects to carry a record 103m passengers. In June, Ryanair carried 9.5m customers, up 14% on a year earlier. By comparison, the combined British Airways/Iberia operation carried 7.8m passengers in June. In typically combative mode, O\u2019Leary said the airline would continue to grow strongly in Copenhagen \u2013 despite a bruising battle with unions in Denmark. \u201cTwo weeks ago we decided, in the best interests of our customers and people, to close our two Danish bases in Copenhagen and Billund. This followed threats by the Danish Unions who admitted that they had no members among our Copenhagen pilots or cabin crew to get their members (competitor airline employees) to blockade/disrupt our flights. \u201cBy moving the aircraft from Copenhagen and Billund to airports outside Denmark the unions have no legal basis for imposing these threatened disruptions, which allows us to continue to grow strongly in Copenhagen without union interference.\u201d He added that the airline continues to be \u201cinundated\u201d with invitations from airports around Europe to become Ryanair destinations. Ryanair\u2019s expansion in 2016 will be focused on Germany, where it opens in Berlin, its sixth base in the country, in September. From November, Israel will become the 31st country to be served by Ryanair, although flights will be to the beach resort of Eilat, not Tel Aviv. Earlier this month, Ryanair accepted an offer from International Airlines Group (IAG) for its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus. However, Ryanair denounced the \u201cbaseless\u201d divestment forced on it by UK regulators. \u201cWe will continue to oppose the UK CMA\u2019s baseless 2013 divestment ruling, (and their recent rejection of Ryanair\u2019s request to review that decision), which was based on the invented theory that no other airline would bid for Aer Lingus while Ryanair was a minority shareholder. This has been hopelessly exposed by IAG\u2019s current offer for Aer Lingus, even while Ryanair was its largest single shareholder.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Ryanair is seeking to crush flight price comparison websites such as Expedia and Opodo, claiming they \u201cmake no sense\u201d and \u201cshouldn\u2019t exist\u201d. </p> <p> The airline\u2019s controversial boss, Michael O\u2019Leary, has written to four other leading airlines in Europe asking them to display each other\u2019s fares on their website, to circumvent the price comparison sites. </p> <p> He did not name the airlines, but they are understood to be IAG (British Airways/Iberia), Air France/KLM, Lufthansa and easyJet. </p> <p> \u201cI think it is something the big airlines could and should work together on because I think it makes no sense for third-party price comparison websites out there,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in a video statement.</p> <p> \u201cIf the airlines were competitive and had a competent digital offering those kind of websites shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d None of the airlines has responded to O\u2019Leary\u2019s suggestion. </p> <p> The statement came as Ryanair posted a 25% rise in quarterly profits, with rising passenger numbers attributed to its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/30/ryanair-being-nice-fewer-rules-less-hassle-more-profit\">new approach to customer service</a>. </p> <p> The number of customers jumped from 24.3m to 28m in the three months to June 30, 2015 while profits surged from \u20ac197m to \u20ac245m. </p> <p> Average fares fell to just \u20ac45 (\u00a332) as Ryanair used lower fuel costs to cut prices, while fewer customers paid to put their bags in the hold (or what it called \u201clower checked-bag penetration\u201d).</p> <p> The airline predicted that airfares will fall by 4-8% in the second half of 2015, as cheap fuel prompts a price war among European airlines. </p> <p> Ryanair has paid an average of $91 a barrel for forward-bought fuel for 2016, but has managed to cut that to $66 for 2017, saving it \u20ac250m. </p> <p> Next year it expects to carry a record 103m passengers. In June, Ryanair carried 9.5m customers, up 14% on a year earlier. By comparison, the combined British Airways/Iberia operation carried 7.8m passengers in June. </p> <p> In typically combative mode, O\u2019Leary said the airline would continue to grow strongly in Copenhagen \u2013 despite<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/17/ryanair-closes-denmark-operation-temporarily-to-sidestep-union-dispute\"> a bruising battle with unions in Denmark</a>. </p> <p> \u201cTwo weeks ago we decided, in the best interests of our customers and people, to close our two Danish bases in Copenhagen and Billund. This followed threats by the Danish Unions who admitted that they had no members among our Copenhagen pilots or cabin crew to get their members (competitor airline employees) to blockade/disrupt our flights. </p> <p> \u201cBy moving the aircraft from Copenhagen and Billund to airports outside Denmark the unions have no legal basis for imposing these threatened disruptions, which allows us to continue to grow strongly in Copenhagen without union interference.\u201d</p> <p> He added that the airline continues to be \u201cinundated\u201d with invitations from airports around Europe to become Ryanair destinations. </p> <p> Ryanair\u2019s expansion in 2016 will be focused on Germany, where it opens in Berlin, its sixth base in the country, in September. From November, Israel will become the  31st country to be served by Ryanair, although flights will be to the beach resort of Eilat, not Tel Aviv. </p> <p> Earlier this month, Ryanair accepted an offer from International Airlines Group (IAG) for its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus.</p> <p> However, Ryanair denounced the \u201cbaseless\u201d divestment forced on it by UK regulators. </p> <p> \u201cWe will continue to oppose the UK CMA\u2019s baseless 2013 divestment ruling, (and their recent rejection of Ryanair\u2019s request to review that decision), which was based on the invented theory that no other airline would bid for Aer Lingus while Ryanair was a minority shareholder. This has been hopelessly exposed by IAG\u2019s current offer for Aer Lingus, even while Ryanair was its largest single shareholder.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just when investors thought it might be time for a summer lull, financial markets have shifted their focus from the eurozone and its Greek woes to tumbling commodity prices. A combination of factors have knocked gold, crude oil and industrial metals such as copper in recent days. What commodities are on the move and what are they used for? Gold Primarily used in jewellery and as a financial instrument, such as in the form of bars in central bank vaults, gold is also in demand from electronics companies and for medical uses such as dentistry. Gold has hit its lowest level since early 2010 amid heavy selling in recent weeks. Traditionally the precious metal has served as a safe haven for investors during periods of uncertainty but investors often move money into other assets once calm returns. Gold also suffers when interest rates show signs of going up, as in the US right now where the central bank appears to be readying for a hike. Because gold does not pay interest it loses its shine compared with other assets that do. Ten years ago gold was worth around $500 (\u00a3320) an ounce, only to soar above $1,800 following the first Greek crisis in 2011. Brent crude Refined into petrol and diesel, Brent crude is produced from North Sea oilfields. It is used on financial markets as a benchmark against which a large proportion of internationally traded crude oils are priced. At just under $55 a barrel, Brent crude has halved from a high of $115 hit a year ago, battered by a combination of rising supply, particularly in the US, and falling demand on the back of China\u2019s economic slowdown and shaky confidence in Europe. Oil fell further on Monday amid renewed stock market turmoil in China, the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer. Platinum Used for jewellery and by the car industry, for making catalytic converters, the precious metal has suffered from waning demand as the global economy loses momentum, with prices now at a six-year low. Against that backdrop, platinum producer Lonmin plans to shut or mothball several mines, putting 6,000 South African jobs at risk. Aluminium The light metal has a wide range of uses including food and drink packaging, aeroplanes, construction and even the Rio 2016 Olympic torch \u2013 made from recycled aluminium. Prices hit a six-year low earlier this month, on the back of falling demand combined with high supply, with analysts blaming large-scale exports from its top producer, China. There has been further pressure on metals from moves in the currency market. The rise in the US currency makes dollar-priced metals more expensive for overseas buyers. Copper The red metal is used in everything from electrical wiring to pipework and coins (usually as a coating), and mixed with other metals to make alloys. Like aluminium, copper has fallen in price because of oversupply as well as tumbling demand in China, its biggest consumer market. Highlighting the metal\u2019s sensitivity to Chinese economic news, it fell to a six-year low on Friday after weak Chinese manufacturing figures. It has started the week with a further fall but analysts said copper may now get a boost from bargain hunters as manufacturers use the low price to replenish stocks. Iron ore As the main ingredient in steel, iron ore is sensitive to any slowdown in larger economies and in particular to cutbacks in infrastructure projects. A slowdown in steel production in China has come as miners have raised their iron ore output and so prices have tumbled from $190 a tonne four years ago to around $50 at present.",

      "bodyText": "Billionaire Gina Rinehart has bought Fossil Downs, one of Western Australia\u2019s oldest family-run cattle stations, to add to her growing agricultural empire. It is the first time the 400,000-hectare station \u2013 located at the fork of the Fitzroy and Margaret rivers about 30km from Fitzroy Crossing in the Kimberley \u2013 has been sold in its 133-year history. The mining magnate\u2019s company, Hancock Prospecting, finalised the sale on Friday. The sale price has not been disclosed, but the asking price was rumoured to be about $30m. Real estate agent Malcolm French, who handled the sale for the owners, John and Annette Henwood, wouldn\u2019t confirm that figure but said, \u201cwe have achieved our objective\u201d. A spokesman for Hancock Prospecting said the property would form part of a growing agricultural portfolio, which includes a stake in WA-owned dairy company Bannister Downs, a $25-million herd of wagyu beef cattle, and a 50% stake in two other Kimberley cattle stations, Liveringa and Nerrima, which was purchased for $40 million last year. Graham Laitt, whose company Milne Agrigroup is a joint partner in the Liveringa station beef venture, told Guardian Australia that the Fossil Downs cattle would be managed with the cattle from the other two stations and would bring Rinehart\u2019s herd in WA up to 60,000 head. Laitt said the aim was to build up the cattle herd enough to justify re-opening a mothballed abattoir in the Kimberley, which would allow the company to export locally-killed beef directly to China. Annette Henwood is the granddaughter of Dan MacDonald, who signed the original pastoral lease for Fossil Downs for \u00a325 a year in 1882, prompting his brothers, William and Charles MacDonald, to set off on the longest overland cattle drive in Australia\u2019s history. The MacDonald brothers and four others, including members of the MacKenzie family, who co-owned the station in its early days, took four years to trek the 5,600km distance from Goulburn, NSW, to Fossil Downs. They left with about 700 cattle and 60 horses, and arrived in 1886 with 327 cattle and 13 horses. The Henwoods took over the property from Annette\u2019s father, Bill MacDonald, who built the current homestead to such a high standard that it was featured in the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly as \u201ca splendid heritage\u201d in 1952. Speaking to the West Australian in May, Annette said selling the property made her \u201cfeel like an absolute traitor,\u201d adding \u201cI never wanted to be the MacDonald who quit\u201d. But French told Guardian Australia that the couple, who are now in their 70s, simply couldn\u2019t manage the property any longer. \u201cIt\u2019s been highly emotional, all the way along,\u201d the estate agent said. \u201cThis is not a case of someone wanting to cash in, it\u2019s purely retirement. I suppose they\u2019ll buy a home in Broome or somewhere in the Kimberley. They can\u2019t stand the cold down here [in Perth].\u201d French said it was one of the most significant properties in the state and one of the last stations of its kind in Australia. \u201cThe word \u2018icon\u2019 is used quite a lot but in the true sense of the word this is an iconic farm,\u201d he said. Elsia Archer, a friend of the Henwoods and president of the Derby/West Kimberley shire, told Guardian Australia that the sale of the station to \u201cyet another corporation\u201d felt like the end of a chapter in the Kimberley\u2019s history. \u201cIt\u2019s an era that we\u2019re losing,\u201d Archer said. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite sad.\u201d Like any property in the Kimberley, Fossil Downs has a mixed history. The same Women\u2019s Weekly article that praised the pioneering spirit of the MacDonalds also praised them for being at the \u201cforefront of a new deal for the natives, who are too often regarded as a superior type of working beast\u201d. The Gooniyandi people were granted native title over a large section of the station in 2013 after a 15-year campaign. Muludja, a remote Aboriginal community of about 100 people, is located on the station about 2km from the homestead.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s sticking points on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement are biologic patents and market access around sugar and dairy, the trade minister has revealed, as it seems likely an agreement will be reached by the end of this week. Andrew Robb has flown to Hawaii for what he hopes is the final round of negotiations on the broad detail of the TPP as looming elections in the US and Canada put pressure on the nations to reach a deal. The latest round of negotiations comes as Labor passed a motion at its national conference to remove-investor state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses from existing trade agreements, which Robb has warned could jeopardise Australia\u2019s standing as a reliable trading partner. \u201cWe are very close [to an agreement on TPP] and I do feel that we\u2019re into the last few issues,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s AM program on Monday. \u201cPeople do seem to have come with a mind with trying to conclude it and I\u2019m quite hopeful by the end of the week we will have achieved what I think is the best trade deal since the Uruguay Round 20 years ago.\u201d Robb rejected criticisms the TPP negotiations have been shrouded in secrecy, saying broad detail of the agreement could be available to the public as early as the end of the week. Asked what issues were still being ironed out, Robb responded: \u201cDifferent companies, different issues really, for Australia of course the biologics, what protection periods extend to biologic has been an issue from the outset and is still unresolved. \u201cSome market access issues are still in the discussion stage and sugar is in that category, same of dairy. Depending on the country, it is different issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it is concluded [people will see the details], the thing is nothing\u2019s agreed until everything is agreed, we\u2019ve been through thousands of pages of different issues which in large part have now been resolved but only if some of the more difficult issues are also agreed, nothing\u2019s agreed until everything\u2019s agreed.\u201d National MPs have previously said they will not support a TPP that does not expand Australia\u2019s sugar export opportunities, a position backed by the agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce. The biologics debate is centred on proposed 12-year patents which would mean medical companies could not develop particular treatments for various cancers and diseases for more than a decade if another company had a patent on it. Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers have formed a group to raise concerns about the secrecy of the TPP, specifically that details will not be made public until after Robb signs it. The TPP involves countries that make up 40% of the world\u2019s global economy \u2013 America, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. At its completion, the TPP will cover trade, intellectual-property rights and financial regulations. It comes on the heels of Australia\u2019s free trade agreement with China and Labor backing a motion supported by Labor\u2019s trade spokeswoman Penny Wong at its weekend national conference that ISDS clauses be removed from existing FTAs. \u201cMany nations have expressed concern about the ISDS tribunal system and a future Labor government will have numerous international partners interested in reforming the ISDS system,\u201d Pat Conroy, the NSW MP who introduced it, said. When questioned about the motion by Guardian Australia, Robb pointed out that in three decades of ISDS clauses in FTAs the only time Australia has been sued by a company was over plain packaging cigarette laws introduced by the previous Labor government. Robb criticised the motion and labelled talk about seeking to renegotiate trade agreements as \u201ctotally irresponsible and undermines our reputation as a reliable trading partner\u201d. He said Labor has negotiated FTAs containing ISDS provision and cited Chile as an example. \u201cWhat seems to be ignored is that ISDS provisions provide an important safeguard for Australian investors abroad in countries which in some cases have less reliable political and legal systems than ours,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAustralia has an enviable reputation as an investment destination and in a highly competitive environment, ISDS provisions further enhance that reputation. Modern ISDS provisions include important safeguards to protect our ability to legislate and regulate in important public policy areas such as health.\u201d",

Depending on the country, it is different issues,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it is concluded [people will see the details], the thing is nothing\u2019s agreed until everything is agreed, we\u2019ve been through thousands of pages of different issues which in large part have now been resolved but only if some of the more difficult issues are also agreed, nothing\u2019s agreed until everything\u2019s agreed.\u201d</p> <p>National MPs have previously said they will not support a TPP that does not expand Australia\u2019s sugar export opportunities, <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/barnaby-joyce-backs-nationals-mp-over-tpp-sugar-backlash/story-fn59niix-1227431307812\">a position backed by the agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/comment/tpp-could-force-australia-to-americanstyle-health-system-20150625-ghxdes.html\">biologics debate</a> is centred on proposed 12-year patents which would mean medical companies could not develop particular treatments for various cancers and diseases for more than a decade if another company had a patent on it.</p> <p>Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/22/labor-greens-and-crossbenchers-concerned-at-trans-pacific-partnership\">formed a group to raise concerns about the secrecy of the TPP</a>, specifically that details will not be made public until after Robb signs it.</p> <p>The TPP involves countries that make up 40% of the world\u2019s global economy \u2013 America, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.

Modern ISDS provisions include important safeguards to protect our ability to legislate and regulate in important public policy areas such as health.\u201d</p>",
