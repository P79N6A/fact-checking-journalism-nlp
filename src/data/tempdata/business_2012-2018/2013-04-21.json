      "bodyText": "Ahead of official figures on Thursday that will show whether the UK has slipped into a triple-dip recession comes a downbeat report into consumers' finances. British households felt worse off in April as they continued to struggle with rising prices and meagre pay growth, suggests a survey out on Monday from the financial information services company Markit. Bringing a halt to what had been an improving trend so far this year, the Markit household finance index slid lower this month, signalling that household finances were deteriorating faster than in March. The firm said the result largely reflected the combined effect of lower income and higher living costs for households. \"Triple dip or no triple dip, there has been little alleviation of the strain on households' financial wellbeing so far this year. Moreover, with incomes failing to keep pace with living costs, household finance constraints are likely to act as a further drag on consumer spending over the months ahead,\" said Markit's senior economist Tim Moore. In its first monthly fall this year, the household finance index dropped to 37.7, down from 39.3 in March and well below the 50-mark that separates improvement from deterioration. Four times as many households, or 32%, reported a worsening in their finances in April than those who saw an improvement. Households were slightly less downbeat, however, about the outlook for the next 12 months. Economists are divided over whether official data on Thursday will show the UK economy shrank in the first quarter, marking a triple-dip recession. Capital Economics says the chances of a further drop in GDP are \"pretty much 50/50\". \"Of course, whether the economy shrinks by a fraction or grows by a fraction is of little importance in the big picture. Barring a major surprise in this week's GDP figures, the main point is that the recovery will still look depressingly dismal \u2013 especially now that the labour market is weakening,\" said Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, is forecasting marginal GDP growth of 0.1 to 0.2% but says the first quarter is hard to call. \"There is major uncertainty over the outlook given that March's cold weather could have had a further dampening impact on economic activity after the snow in January took a toll,\" he said.\"It would be good for psychological/confidence reasons if the economy could dodge contraction in the first quarter and therefore avoid nasty and potentially damaging headlines about triple-dip recession.\"",

      "bodyText": "Pret A Manger, the food chain known for its fresh lunchtime baguettes, sandwiches and wraps, is set to create 1,000 jobs worldwide, including 500 positions in the UK after a bumper boost in profits. However, the company is likely to come under pressure to ensure most of the jobs go to British workers having faced criticism in the past that it was favouring foreign staff. In the past year bosses have attempted to tackle the calls from Boris Johnson, the London mayor, and Chris Grayling, former employment minister, to increase British staffing levels, revealing 20% of workers are from the UK, compared with 17% a year earlier. A school-leavers' programme has been launched and will be extended across the country, with the aim of information being sent to every pupil leaving school this year. Pret's chief executive, Clive Schlee, recently said: \"We are pleased that we have seen some encouraging signs and that the number of British workers at Pret has increased. But this is not a Pret issue, this is an industry-wide issue and there is no quick fix. \"We are expanding our school-leavers programme this coming year and will continue to do all that we can to attract more British applicants.

The 500 staff employed last year were hired on the same criteria. A plan to get the homeless back to work has also seen 84 apprentices given jobs with around 50 having worked for Pret for more than six months. It comes as the company, which has 320 stores and plans to open another 50, saw sales increase 17% to \u00a3443m last year with underlying profits also up 17% to \u00a361.1m. The business has undergone a major expansion, taking advantage of the high street decline by negotiating lower rents. Management have said in the past that the rate of expansion \u2013 36 opened last year, bringing the total to 323 \u2013 has only been possible due to landlords keen to fill empty spaces. The company, which was bought by private equity firm Bridgepoint in 2008 for \u00a3345m \u2013 netting the founders Julian Metcalfe and Sinclair Beecham \u00a350m each \u2013 has expanded worldwide, with stores in Hong Kong, Paris and the US. In France, the new Parisian shops have been so successful that average weekly sales at the stores take more money than any other Pret worldwide, the company said. A major refurbishment plan is already underway, with bosses keen to encourage more customers to eat in, rather than be seen as just a takeaway operation. They also revealed that its tuna baguette has overtaken the super club sandwich as its best selling UK sandwich. Other projects include donating unsold sandwiches to the homeless, with employees giving away 2.5m in the past year while it also gave \u00a31m to homeless charities. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 April to correct the company's annual profits",

    "webTitle": "George Osborne prepares for battle with the IMF", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne likes to slip away at the end of meetings of the International Monetary Fund to visit a civil war battlefield. This year, it was the appropriately named Chancellorsville in Virginia, where the confederate general Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson lost his life to friendly fire in 1863. It was a relevant choice. Osborne was wounded last week by friendly fire from the IMF, and another battle is looming when that body sends a team of officials to Britain next month to give the economy its annual inspection. Unless, the next batch of data \u2013 starting with the first quarter growth numbers this week \u2013 provides strong evidence that the UK has at last started to recover sustainably, the fund will be urging Osborne to provide a boost to demand. This doesn't necessarily mean it will call publicly for the Treasury to abandon its plan to tighten fiscal policy this year. But that is likely to be its recommendation, unless Osborne can find an alternative way of expanding demand. Unsurprisingly, the chancellor was mightily unhappy that the IMF singled out the UK as a country that needed to rethink its approach to tax and public spending. In part, that was because the fund was initially four-square behind the government's austerity plan. In part, it's because Osborne has a good relationship with Christine Lagarde, the fund's managing director, and was the first finance minister to endorse her when she was running for the job. In part, it's because the chancellor thinks he has already done quite a lot to underpin the economy, including the budget help for the housing market. And in part it's because Osborne believes \u2013 quite correctly \u2013 that there are other countries more deserving of a kicking from the IMF. He could certainly have done without its intervention in a week in which that saw unemployment rise, a second credit downgrade and the debunking of the seminal paper by Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff that has been used by fiscal conservatives \u2013 including Osborne \u2013 to justify austerity. The significance of the now-infamous Reinhart-Rogoff paper was that it struck a chord when it was published in 2010. By arguing that growth rates fell sharply when a nation's debt as a proportion of its annual output reached 90%, it was manna from heaven for those policy makers keen to take immediate and tough action to tighten fiscal policy. As a result of basic spreadsheet errors in the original calculations, it is now clear that the 90% debt cliff does not exist. Moreover, it has ensured a wider hearing for those economists who have always been sceptical about the R-R thesis. Put simply, the counter argument is that Reinhart and Rogoff have confused cause and effect: countries have high debt levels because they have slow growth rather than having slow growth because they are heavily indebted. This seems logical. Britain's debt to GDP ratio has more than doubled in the past five years and is now close to the 90% level. But it was the collapse of the economy in 2008-09 followed by the most tepid of recoveries that blew a hole in the government finances. There is no indication that servicing this debt is prohibitively expensive: indeed, interest rates on government gilts are close to historic lows. As they are in other countries \u2013 such as the US and Germany \u2013 that are running debt to GDP ratios of a similar size. The message is a simple one: get economies moving and the debt will look after itself. Unfortunately, there was not the slightest indication in Washington last week that policymakers knew how to do this. Indeed, the spat between Britain and the Fund helped enliven what would otherwise have been a depressing meeting.The IMF's plan involves keeping monetary policy ultra loose while easing back on austerity in those countries where there is scope to do so. But the IMF has a silo-like approach, suggesting policies for individual countries but failing to look at the bigger picture. Sadly, only a second crisis is likely to rekindle the spirit of collective endeavour evident in 2008 when the global financial system was on the brink of meltdown. For now, policymakers are keeping their fingers crossed that unprecedented monetary policy easing will eventually work while harbouring fears that the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2008-09 could be a low-growth, high unemployment equilibrium of a sort not seen since the 1930s. There was, however, a marked reluctance to voice this fear openly. Despite revising down its forecasts, the IMF said it was encouraged by the improvement in financial market conditions and believed that the global economy was on the mend. Privately, however, it presented two alternative risk scenarios \u2013 one in which a faster than expected recovery leads to central banks unwinding their colossal monetary stimulus too quickly, and another in which growth continues to disappoint, leading to rising debt levels for both public and private sectors. As things stand, the second scenario looks the more likely. All three of the global economy's growth engines have their problems. The US is recovering more quickly than most advanced countries, but by historic standards the 2% growth expected this year is weak. The housing market is on the mend and US banks are in a better state than those in Europe, but budget wrangling between the White House and Congress will stifle activity over the coming months.China looks like an accident about to happen. Growth has been pumped up in recent years by over-investment in new manufacturing capacity and by a real estate bubble. Activity has started to slow and the debts incurred by local government are an unexploded bomb ticking away under the economy. Finally, of course, there is Europe, the part of the world where the shortcomings of the fund's piecemeal approach are most obvious. Here, a bit of what Keynes called \"ruthless truth telling\" is in order, because the structural problems of the single currency are big enough to drag down the rest of the global economy. The truth about the eurozone is that there is a massive gap in competitiveness between the rich and poor parts of monetary union that can only be tackled in one of three ways: year after year of austerity, transfers of resources from north to south, or a break-up that will permit devaluation. Instead, ad hoc bailouts are organised each time the debt crisis rolls on to a new country. Slovenia may be next. The economist George Akerlof came up with a metaphor for the state of the global economy at an IMF conference on rethinking macro economics. \"The cat is still stuck up the tree and we don't know how to get it down\", he said. Keynes would suggest building a bigger ladder. Hayek would wait for the cat to jump down of its own accord. The European approach involves chopping the tree down.",

For now, policymakers are keeping their fingers crossed that unprecedented monetary policy easing will eventually work while harbouring fears that the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2008-09 could be a low-growth, high unemployment equilibrium of a sort not seen since the 1930s.</p> <p>There was, however, a marked reluctance to voice this fear openly. Despite revising down its forecasts, the IMF said it was encouraged by the improvement in financial market conditions and believed that the global economy was on the mend. Privately, however, it presented two alternative risk scenarios \u2013 one in which a faster than expected recovery leads to central banks unwinding their colossal monetary stimulus too quickly, and another in which growth continues to disappoint, leading to rising debt levels for both public and private sectors. As things stand, the second scenario looks the more likely.</p> <p>All three of the global economy's growth engines have their problems. The US is recovering more quickly than most advanced countries, but by historic standards the 2% growth expected this year is weak. The housing market is on the mend and US banks are in a better state than those in Europe, but budget wrangling between the White House and Congress will stifle activity over the coming months.China looks like an accident about to happen. Growth has been pumped up in recent years by over-investment in new manufacturing capacity and by a real estate bubble. Activity has started to slow and the debts incurred by local government are an unexploded bomb ticking away under the economy.</p> <p>Finally, of course, there is Europe, the part of the world where the shortcomings of the fund's piecemeal approach are most obvious. Here, a bit of what Keynes called \"ruthless truth telling\" is in order, because the structural problems of the single currency are big enough to drag down the rest of the global economy. The truth about the eurozone is that there is a massive gap in competitiveness between the rich and poor parts of monetary union that can only be tackled in one of three ways: year after year of austerity, transfers of resources from north to south, or a break-up that will permit devaluation. Instead, ad hoc bailouts are organised each time the debt crisis rolls on to a new country. Slovenia may be next.</p> <p>The economist George Akerlof came up with a metaphor for the state of the global economy at an IMF conference on rethinking macro economics. \"The cat is still stuck up the tree and we don't know how to get it down\", he said. Keynes would suggest building a bigger ladder. Hayek would wait for the cat to jump down of its own accord. The European approach involves chopping the tree down.</p>",
