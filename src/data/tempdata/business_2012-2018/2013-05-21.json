      "bodyText": "Lost tax revenue from money salted away offshore is costing governments more than $150bn (\u00a399bn) a year, Oxfam has found \u2013 enough to eliminate extreme poverty across the globe twice over. The charity said it was time for David Cameron to put words into action by taking tougher action against UK-linked tax havens. It urged the prime minister to agree an international deal that would end secrecy and allow developing countries to recover the billions of pounds they were owed. According to Oxfam's estimates, almost $18.5tn is being held for individuals in tax havens, one third of it in British Overseas Territories and crown dependencies. The charity said that even on conservative assumptions, the $18.5tn would yield $156bn to tax authorities around the world, whilst the cost of providing every person on earth with an income of $1.25 a day would be $66bn. Emma Seery, Oxfam's Head of Development Finance and Public Services, said: \"These figures put the UK at the centre of a global tax system that is a colossal betrayal of people here and in the poorest countries who are struggling to get by, and they put the government on the side of the privileged few. If they want to get on the right side of this debate, now is the time to take action. \"Britain's credibility is on the line; talking tough on tax, whilst continuing to usher a third of the world's wealth into UK tax havens, risks making a mockery of David Cameron's leadership at the G8 Summit in June.\" A Treasury spokeswoman said: \"The Government strongly supports tax capacity building in developing countries and announced extra support in this year's budget. \"As the prime minister said in his recent letter to the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, we want to ensure information exchange works effectively for both developed and developing countries. That is why we strongly support the multilateral convention on mutual assistance in tax matters which will assist information exchange with those developing countries that join the convention.\" Cameron will use a meeting of the European Council on Tuesday to push Luxembourg and Austria to drop their opposition to exchanging information about savings. The need to tackle tax havens is also going to be one of the main topics on the agenda at next month's G8 summit in Northern Ireland. Britain will be pressing for more transparency on who owns companies domiciled in tax havens, with the aim of raising more revenue. Seery said: \"David Cameron and [Chancellor] George Osborne continue to tour the world making promises to clamp down on tax havens, but so far they've done absolutely nothing to make tax deals work for poor countries. \"The UK and Europe cannot stand by and watch more people fall victim to the bite of austerity while billions are lost from the public purse on their watch. \"Unless the EU agrees a tax havens black list and clear sanctions, we'll get little more than hot air from leaders.\"",

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney warns Europe against lost decade of austerity", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The incoming governor of the Bank of England has warned Europe it must make \"sustained and significant reforms\" if it is to avoid a Japanese-style lost decade caused by austerity measures. Mark Carney, in his last speech as governor of the Bank of Canada, said Europe \"can draw lessons from Japan on the dangers of half measures\". He added: \"Europe remains in recession, with economic activity constrained by fiscal austerity, low confidence and tight credit conditions. Deep challenges persist in its financial system. Without sustained and significant reforms, a decade of stagnation threatens.\" He described Japan's recent efforts to kick-start its economy and bring an end to a decade of deflation as a \"bold policy experiment\". The initiatives, dubbed Abenomics after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, involve monetary and fiscal measures, including a huge money-printing exercise. Carney was speaking shortly after UK data showed inflation had fallen more than expected last month, potentially giving him more room to shore up the economy with a new round of quantitative easing \u2013 electronic money printing \u2013 should the recovery falter. It was the first drop in the consumer prices measure of inflation (CPI) since last autumn, down to 2.4% in April from 2.8% in March. The softening was driven by lower fuel costs and airfares as the oil price fell, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The only real upward effect on the headline inflation number was a rise in food prices after damage to crops over the long winter. Food prices were up 4.6% on a year ago and within that vegetable price inflation was at a four-year high of 9.9%. Economists had forecast CPI to come in at 2.6% for April and said the softer outcome would ease some of the immediate pressure on Carney when he takes the helm at the BoE in July. But most predicted inflation would pick up again over the summer. \"The bottom line is this is not the start of a collapse. A lot of the fall is temporary. However, it probably does spare Mark Carney the bother of writing to the chancellor to explain why inflation is above 3% within his first month in office,\" said Alan Clarke at Scotiabank in London. Inflation has been above the Bank's government-set target of 2% for more than three years and rose as high as 5.2% in autumn 2011. Tuesday's data showed the first drop in the rate since last September but economists and the BoE predicts it will tick higher again, partly as the downward effect of a period of falling fuel prices comes to an end. Between March and April this year, petrol and diesel prices both fell \u2013 by 2.1p and 3.9p a litre respectively \u2013 compared with rises of 3.2p and 2.1p a year earlier. Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics said: \"Inflation still looks set to climb again in the coming months as we reach the anniversary of a period of falling petrol prices and deep discounting on the high street. However, the peak, probably in June, could now be closer to 3% than the 3.5% we had expected beforehand. What's more, underlying price pressures still look subdued.\" The ONS said core inflation, which strips out the erratic components of food and energy, fell to 2%, the lowest rate since autumn 2009. The retail prices index, which includes mortgage payments, fell from 3.3% to 2.9%. Separate ONS data showed factory gate inflation, which measures prices charged by producers, was the slowest since autumn 2009. The government welcomed the drop in headline inflation. \"This is good news for families and businesses. Inflation is down by more than a half from its peak,\" the Treasury said in a statement. But critics of the government's austerity drive noted price rises were still outstripping average pay growth of 0.8%, leaving many households struggling to cover basic costs such as food and energy bills. Labour's shadow treasury minister Cathy Jamieson commented: \"On top of stagnant wages, rising food prices and soaring energy bills, the average family is \u00a3891 worse off this year because of tax and benefit changes since 2010.\" The TUC calculates that workers are \u00a343 a week worse off in real terms compared with three years ago. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"Average pay packets have fallen by nearly 10% over the last three years \u2013 eroding the spending power of households and eating away at the value of savings for those families still fortunate enough to have them. \"Unless we start to see real wages increase, consumer spending will remain weak and the economy will continue to struggle.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of the Commons home affairs committee has branded a \u00a31.2m payoff to outgoing G4S chief executive Nick Buckles \"astonishing\" given his role in the Olympics security fiasco last summer. Keith Vaz said it must not be mistaken for a reward for \"spectacular failure\", following the news of Buckles's unexpected departure after 28 years at the company. Buckles, who quit in the wake of a recent profit warning despite having survived the initial fallout from the London Games debacle, will leave with a total financial package worth about \u00a316m. The \u00a31.2m payoff is equivalent to what he would receive for his contractual notice period of 12 months and includes his basic annual salary of \u00a3830,000, a \u00a3332,000 pension allowance, and a \u00a320,000 car allowance. He has also built up a \u00a39.5m pension pot, and shares worth nearly \u00a35.5m. G4S said Buckles would leave on 31 May, less than week before the company's annual meeting, where he would have been up for re-election. He will be replaced by Ashley Almanza, who joined the company just three weeks ago as chief financial officer from BG Group. A spokesman for the FTSE 100 company said the timing of his departure was unrelated to the annual meeting, and was instead driven by the company's recent performance, which was outlined in a trading update on 7 May. \"Nick was disappointed after the first quarter trading update and profit warning, and the shareholder reaction to it. He felt he needed to discuss the future of the company and its leadership with the chairman and this is the decision they reached.\" Shareholders agreed that it was \"in the best interests of the company\", the spokesman said. Buckles's departure follows a string of corporate mishaps, including G4S's \u00a35.2bn bid for Danish cleaning company ISS, which it was forced to abandon after opposition from shareholders. Investors had stood by Buckles even as the Olympics contract began to unravel last July and after a damning report by MPs on the home affairs committee which said G4S was solely to blame for the staffing fiasco. Investors argued that the botched ISS bid and Olympics contract could be forgiven because of his strong long-term record at the company. At the time of the MPs' inquiry, Neil Woodford, investment manager at Invesco Perpetual, which owns about 15% of G4S, said the intense parliamentary grilling of Buckles was like watching \"a medieval persecution\". It is understood that Woodford was supportive of the changes announced on Tuesday. Another leading shareholder, who did not want to be named, said: \"I don't think anyone was howling for his head but boards are there to think about the future and develop the management to judge the best way to create returns for shareholders. \"There is no huge animosity towards to him but there was a sequence of events and the board has decided it was time for a new style of management.\" Pressure has remained on Buckles and the company over the past 10 months, underlined by the Ministry of Justice's decision last week to investigate whether G4S and Serco were overpaid for contracts to electronically tag offenders. \"What changed was the profits warning a few weeks ago \u2013 this was the final straw,\" said Caroline De La Soujeole, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe. \"It dawned on people that this couldn't go on. The focus had become too much about Buckles and not the business itself.\" She said that while the \"writing was on the wall\" for Buckles after a series of business mishaps, the timing of his exit was a surprise. The Olympics contract, which ultimately cost G4S \u00a388m, saw thousands of troops and police drafted in to guard the Games at the 11th hour after the company found it could not process applications quickly enough. Buckles himself admitted it had turned into a \"humiliating shambles\". Buckles had been in line for a pay packet of up to \u00a34.5m for the next year had he stayed at the company and met all his performance targets.John Connolly, chairman of G4S, thanked him for the \"massive contribution\" he had made to the company over a career spanning almost three decades.",

Osborne has also argued that any benefits from a modest easing of fiscal policy could easily be swamped by the loss of government credibility from a policy U-turn. If this has failed to sway the IMF, it will put the chancellor in a spot, because in 2010 the fund provided the coalition with political cover by strongly backing austerity. Yet if it backs down a month after being so publicly critical of Britain, it will look weak. Osborne's chances of success have not been helped by the international drift away from austerity in the past month.

Almost 8% of the investor base voted against the company's remuneration policy, which handed its outgoing chief executive Peter Voser a \u20ac3.3m (\u00a32.8m) cash bonus in a year when profits dropped by $1.6bn (\u00a31.05bn) to $27bn. A further 2% of investors abstained from the vote at Shell's annual meeting in The Hague. The bonus took Voser's total salary package to \u20ac5.1m, down from \u20ac5.2m the previous year, although this is still more than double the $2.7m package given to BP boss Bob Dudley last year. Dudley received no bonus as the company continues to deal with the consequences of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. At the meeting, Voser refused to comment on the European commission investigation into claims oil companies have been rigging the price of oil and petrol for more than a decade. Voser, who announced plans to stand down as chief executive earlier this month after less than four years in the job, said it would be \"inappropriate to speculate about the outcome\" of the European-wide investigation. But he said Shell is committed \"to achieve the highest standard of corporate behaviour\". Shell's offices in London and the Netherlands were subjected to dawn raids by European commission regulators investigating allegations big oil companies have \"colluded\" to manipulate oil and petrol prices since 2002. The offices of BP, Norwegian oil company Statoil and oil price reporting agency Platts were also raided last week. The European commission has also written to oil traders and other players in the industry to explain how the $3.4tn global crude market works. Shell's investors voted down its remuneration report in 2009, under which it planned to pay bonuses to its board even through it did not hit pre-set targets.",

      "bodyText": "Over in Greece, there is much ado over former prime minister George Papandreou giving a talk on the crisis that has rocked the country at an upcoming Ted X convention in Edinburgh. Helena Smith in Athens says: On hearing of the politician\u2019s participation in a panel entitled \u201cmoments of truth,\u201d outraged Greeks (for although they are anonymous that is what the protestors are presumed to be) immediately launched a protest campaign that has already drawn thousands of signatories. \u201cGeorge Papandreou lead Greece into the embrace of the IMF \u2026 and [with it] into a deep humanitarian crisis,\u201d said the protestors in a statement that referred to the galloping unemployment, poverty and unprecedented number of suicides that stewardship under the IMF has also unleashed. \u201cAt the same time Papandreou continues to support the neo-liberal policies that drove the country to its present plight while he travels in luxury around the world giving lectures on the lessons he has learned from the Greek crisis.\u201d This is not the first time that Papandreou has been openly criticised for capitalising on the crisis \u2013 the politician\u2019s decision give a course about his experience at Harvard university\u2019s JFK school last year sparked similar anger. But it is the first time that protestors have taken to the internet to vent their spleen \u2013 with the pressure now mounting (2824 signatures had been gathered by this afternoon) it remains to be seen whether he will be forced to pull out of the conference. Meanwhile Papandreou's arch rival -- Greece's current prime minister Antonis Samaras, has spent the afternoon in talks with the head of Gazprom as the country attempts to expedite it\u2019s much-delayed privatisation drive. This is the third time since March that Gazprom chief Alexei Miller has flown into Athens for talks. The Russians have made no secret of the fact that they want to buy Despa, the Greek natural gas company long seen as a jewel in the crown of Greece\u2019s privatisation program which protestors say is yet another humiliation the country is being forced to endure as a result of IMF intervention. And on that note, it's time to close up for the day. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. European markets made a positive finish to the day, boosted by comments from Federal Reserve member James Bullard suggesting there would not be an early end to the central bank's bond buying programme. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 48.24 points at 6803.87, its highest finish since its record close on 30 December 1999 \u2022 Germany's Dax rose 0.19% to 8472.2, reversing an early fall \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.33% higher at 4036.18 \u2022 But Italy's FTSE MIB fell 0.45% although it was well off its lows \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.6% lower The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 48 points or 0.32% higher. Recent comments from US Federal Reserve members seemed to suggest a tapering off of its bond buying programme. But James Bullard, president of St Louis Federal Reserve Bank, said the centrel bank should keep buying bonds, while adjusting the pace depending on economic conditions. And in a speech to the Goethe University in Frankfurt, he said the ECB should consider asset purchases if inflation fell further. He said, as reported by Reuters: Quantitative easing is closest to standard monetary policy [once interest rates get near zero], involves clear action and has been effective. Still with unemployment, one of the biggest issues facing the eurozone (and indeed elsewhere), Germany has agreed a deal to help reduce youth unemployment in Spain. Under the terms of the agreement between the two countries, Germany will create 5,000 jobs a year for young Spanish workers. El Pais reports: A memorandum of understanding in this area was signed Tuesday in Madrid by Spanish Labor Minister F\u00e1tima B\u00e1\u00f1ez and her German counterpart Ursula Von der Leyen. It includes work combined with professional training and stable posts for qualified workers. B\u00e1\u00f1ez welcomed Germany\u2019s \u201ccommitment\u201d toward helping young Spaniards, adding that the accord would provide \u201cmany opportunities for many young Spanish people which today, because of the crisis they do not have in Spain, and which, however, they can have in other European Union countries on a temporary basis.\u201d The accord calls for the interchange of workers and cooperation in the area of labor affairs. There are currently 43,548 Spaniards affiliated with the German Social Security system, and 37,797 Germans in the Spanish system. Both countries also agreed to work together on initiatives at the EU level to reduce youth unemployment. \u201cThis cooperation between Spain and Germany will very soon show itself in additional joint measures that will make a better life for our young people possible,\u201d the two countries said in a statement Greek prime minister Antonis Samara said his recent trips to China and Azerbaijan would help attract outside investment into the country and combat its chronic unemployment problem. According to a report by ekathimerini, Samaras said after a meeting with Greek president Karolos Papoulias in Athens: We have consolidated Greece\u2019s position in Europe and now we are consolidating it on a global level. He said unemployment, which reached a record 27% in February was \u201cthe country\u2019s biggest problem.\u201d An opening rise on Wall Street has given a lift to global markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 49 points or 0.3% in early trading, ahead of a congressional testimony from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday. The meeting will be closely watched for any comments on the Fed's bond buying programme, and whether its quantitative easing could be coming to a close. Recent remarks by Fed members have suggested that actions to boost the economy could start tapering off. With the money taps providing a major influence on the stock market rally, any signs they will be switched off could see shares decline from their recent peaks. At the moment though, investors are still in the mood to wait and see. So with the positive start in the US, the FTSE 100 is at its best levels of the day, up around 25 points at 6781and close to its 2000 peak of 6798. Higher than that, and we are back in territory last seen in 1999, and not far off the all time peak of 6930. Meanwhile European markets have also seen a turnaround after the US open. Both Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 had drifted lower during the morning, but are now up around 3 points. Italy's FTSE MIB and Spain's Ibex 35 are both in negative territory but are off their worst levels. Interesting blogpost on Open Europe today, suggesting that the solution to Britain's \"Europe problem\" could be a new kind of membership of the EU, dubbed EEA plus. This 'special status\u2019 would give Britain the benefits of the single market, along with votes on issues that are relevent to the European Economic Area. Thus, the UK could keep influence on issues that really matter to it, like the financial system. It could also exclude itself from areas where closer integration wasn't desirable. So neither In nor Out. Another great advantage of this model is that it could provide an institutional wrapping for all those countries that for one reason or another cannot be full EU members, and certainly not eurozone members: the UK, Norway, Switzerland and maybe even Turkey. It would be a new mode of European membership - and, if the UK can get its act together, very much the \"economic growth\" tier. EEA plus: a model for the future of the UK in Europe? And I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Thanks all. GW An Italian businessman continues to hold a one-man anti-austerity demonstration on the dome of St Peter's basilica, having scaled it yesterday to protest against the European Union's economic policies. Marcello Di Finizio, who owns a restaurant in Trieste restaurant, dodged security and scaled the basilica on Monday afternoon. Authorities have been trying to persuade the 47-year-old man to come down, but so far without success. Di Finizio, who has climbed the 137-metre dome twice before, is holding a banner which reads: Stop this massacre, the political horror show is continue....help us Pope Francis.. The Italian prime minister has warned that the European Union could implode unless leaders do more to deal with its economic crisis and the record levels of youth unemployment. Enrico Letta, whose popularity has fallen steadily since he was sworn in last month, told the Senate in Rome this morning that EU leaders must show decisive action. Otherwise, he warned, voters will reject the European project at the ballot box. Here are Letta's key quotes (via the Ansa newswire) I have the impression that the EU cannot keep going as it has up to today, with timidness or a lack of decisions. Either it accelerates or it risks imploding.... As things are, I don't think it can hold up and the people will be the ones who make it implode the next time they vote. Letta was briefing MPs before leaders gather for the next Council of Europe meeting on Wednesday. He said youth unemployment had to be an \"absolute\" priority, adding: The EU is in a crisis of legitimacy over the lack of results [on youth joblessness]. The record levels of youth unemployment (over 60% in Greece now), so seem to have shaken European leaders and top officials in Brussels into action. There's a great piece on this issue in Germany's Spiegel newspaper, which lambasts leaders for talking about the problem, but not fixing it. Jobless Youth: Europe's Hollow Efforts to Save a Lost Generation Here's a flavour: Perhaps it takes reaching a certain age to recognize the problem. \"We need a program to eliminate youth unemployment in Southern Europe. (European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel) Barroso has failed to do so,\" says former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, now 94. \"This is a scandal beyond compare.\" Economists also argue that it's about time Europe did something about the problem. \"The long-term prospects of young people in the crisis-ridden countries are extremely grim. This increases the risk of radicalization of an entire generation,\" warns Joachim M\u00f6ller, director of Germany's Institute of Employment Research, a labor market think tank. \"It was a mistake for politicians to acknowledge the problem but do nothing for so long,\" says Michael H\u00fcther, head of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research, which is closely aligned with employers. And Wolfgang Franz, former chairman of the German Council of Economic Experts, says that \"unconventional approaches\" are called for to combat not just youth unemployment but also its long-term negative consequences. \"Someone who is unemployed in his or her younger years will spend a lifetime struggling with poorer career opportunities and lower pay,\" he adds. .... The Italian public are demanding action too, with well-attended protests over the weekend demanding a new economic plan: The pound has fallen more than one cent against the US dollar today following the news that UK inflation fell more than expected in March. The drop in the consumer prices index, from 2.8% to 2.4%, means there's more chance the Bank of England will ease monetary policy again soon. Especially with new governor Mark Carney arriving this summer: Andy Scott, account manager at HIFX, commented: Whilst the economy seems to be showing some more positive signs of recovery, it\u2019s still very sluggish and there\u2019s still the risk of seeing further contractions unless the pace of recovery picks up, especially with the eurozone still in recession. The new governor will no doubt be keen to make his mark at the Bank when he starts in July and he may well opt for additional quantitative easing to further aid the recovery. The overview of the Bundesbank's latest monthly report is online here (pdf). Its upbeat assessment of the German economy is accompanied by this warning: However, the poor economic conditions prevailing in many parts of the euro area and the current problems associated with the sovereign debt crisis mean that macroeconomic risks remain high. Gerrmany's economy is on track for a solid recovery in the current quarter, the Bundesbank has predicted in its new monthly report on Europe's largest economy. The German central bank also warned European leaders not to relax their deficit targets too much, as this would \u2013 in its view \u2013 hurt credibility in the eurozone. The Bundesbank pointed to a recent rise in production orders across the country's manufacturing base: Overall economic activity is expected to improve markedly in the second quarter of 2013, a view that is supported not only by the likely catching- up effects in response to the weather-related downturn in construction activity during last winter. With industrial new orders picking up appreciably after a poor start to the year, there is reason to hope that exports and investment in machinery and equipment \u2013 the demand components that can usually be relied upon most to set the pace for the German economy \u2013 will recover as well. Last week's GDP data showed that Germany grew by just 0.1% in the first three months of 2013, as the wider eurozone shrank by another 0.2%. And on the issue of flexibility when applying deficit-reduction rules, the report said: The binding effect (of the rules) threatens to be damaged from the start if the impression arises that necessary deficit reduction could perpetually be pushed back as long as sufficient political pressure is applied. (quotes via Reuters) The key word here is 'perpetually', I suspect. Spain and France are already being offered more time to get their deficits below the EC's 3% target -- without any alarm in the financial markets. Interesting piece in the Wall Street Journal today about how the eurozone crisis has prompted a surge in grass root politic: It looks at the Spanish municipality of Torrelodones, where housewife-turned-mayor Elena Biurrun has thrown out official perks and used the savings to improve school and local infrastructure since being elected two yeas ago: Here's a flavour: At her inauguration Ms. Biurrun choked up before a jubilant crowd. Then she began slashing away. She lowered the mayor's salary by 21%, to \u20ac49,500 a year, trimmed council members' salaries and eliminated four paid advisory positions. She got rid of the police escort and the leased car, and gave the chauffeur a different job. She returned a carpet, emblazoned with the town seal, that had cost nearly \u20ac300 a month to clean. She ordered council members to pay for their own meals at work events instead of billing the town. \"I was so indignant seeing what these people had been doing with everyone's money as if it were their own,\" Ms. Biurrun said. After yesterday's record high on the German DAX, European stock markets are mostly down this morning. In London, though, the FTSE could hit another 12-year high today, after closing at its highest level since September 2000 yesterday. Traders are anticipating the prospect of central bankers starting to withdraw the drip of monetary stimulus, especially with the Fed's Ben Bernanke testifying at Capitol Hill tomorrow. It's the old argument over whether we're experiencing a bubble that's threatening to pop, or if the central banks are cannily guiding us to a point where genuine confidence and economic fundamentals take over. As Yusuf Heusen, sales trader at IG, explains: Perhaps global growth doesn\u2019t merit markets at these highs, but liquidity-boosting actions from central banks take precedence. The City is also absorbing a profits warning from cruise liner firm Carnival, as my colleague Nick Fletcher explains: FTSE heads for new 13 year high, but Carnival sinks 13% after warning on earnings... ... and the surprise departure of G4S boss Nick Buckles, 10 months after its Olympic security debacle. Economist Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank agrees that UK inflation is heading higher, despite this morning's surprise drop: The squeeze on consumers from higher inflation will get worse before it gets better, but today's data highlights that underlying inflationary pressures remain well contained. Inflation is likely to peak, probably around the 3 percent mark maybe a touch below, this summer which is much better than it seemed a few months ago. Duncan Weldon, the TUC's senior policy officer, cautions against getting too excited by today's drop in inflation: While Societe Generale's Kit Juckes warns that the cost of living will probably head higher: And IG's Chris Beauchamp reckons it gives the new Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, more leeway to waggle the monetary policy levers: Just in, UK inflation has fallen for the first time since last September. The Consumer Prices Index came in at 2.4% last month, the Office for National Statistics reported. That's a surprise drop after March's 2.8%, and closer to the Bank of England's official target of 2%. Lower fuel and lubricant costs were the prime factor, the ONS said. Good news for the UK, although real wages are still failing to keep pace (they're rising by around 0.8% annually, on average). Reaction to follow. Europe has moved a step closer to bailing in large depositors in future bank rescues, as happened in Cyprus this year. Last night, the European Parliament's economics committee approved draft legislation under which customers with more than \u20ac100,000 would be liable to fund a rescue package. Smaller savers, though, would still be protected. This new bank recovery and resolution mechanism is meant to end the era of taxpayer-funded bank rescues. Bank of England Deputy Governor Paul Tucker called it a milestone towards a world where governments were no longer willing to rescue banks that are \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. Under the EU proposal, a bank would dip into large deposits of over \u20ac100,000 once it had exhausted other avenues such as shareholders and bondholders, Reuters explains. There could still be a battle, though, over who stands first in line for losses. Sven Giegold, a German Green lawmaker, explained: The struggle will be how binding the bail-in and the hierarchy of liabilities is. That issue of seniority of claims is explained well by Frances Coppolo, former banker, here: The equivalence of debt and equity. It explains how, if bank is in trouble, losses are initially suffered by shareholders, before working their way down this table: So for all the talk about Cyprus being unique, its bailout was clearly a watershed, as Matina Stevis of the Wall Street Journal points out: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest developments in the eurozone financial crisis and across the global economy. The economic crisis in Southern Europe has been laid bare by Vodafone this morning. It warned shareholders that it has been scorched by the ongoing slump in demand in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece, blaming \"severe macroeconomic weakness\" across the region. Vodafone is taking a new \u00a31.8bn impairment charge on its Spanish and Italian operations, taking its total writedowns on Southern Europe this year alone to a hefty \u00a37.7bn. Revenue in Southern Europe are down by 16.7%. Some of that can be blamed on competition, but mostly its due to the biting recession in the eurozone's weaker members, amid austerity cuts and record unemployment. Vittorio Colao, chief executive, didn't pull his punches either, saying; The macroeconomic environment in Southern Europe has been very challenging. And today's financial results back this up -- with a 12.8% tumble in service revenue in Italy, partly driven by \"the severe macroeconomic weakness\". In Spain, they fell 11.5%. In Greece, too, revenues are down by 13.4%. OK, a nation's mobile phone bill isn't exactly the last word in financial modelling. But it just shows what an economic crisis means in practice -- for companies, fewer calls means less business, while for consumers it's another sign that they simply can't afford to spend what they used to. As usual, I'll be tracking all the news through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail has reported a 60% increase in pre-tax annual profits to \u00a3324m, as the government prepares to sell off the 497-year-old postal service in the most ambitious privatisation since British Gas in 1986. The company, which ministers hope to float on the London Stock Exchange within a year, said its pre-tax profits in the year to the end of March increased to \u00a3324m from \u00a3201m a year earlier. Sales, which were boosted by a 30% rise in the price of first class stamps to 60p, increased by more than \u00a3500m to \u00a39.3bn. Moya Greene, the chief executive, said: \"Our strategy is delivering. The transformation of Royal Mail is well under way.\" Speaking publicly about the privatisation plans for the first time, she said a sale of part of the business would allow Royal Mail to \"combine the best of the public and private sectors\". She promised that the sale would not affect Royal Mail's universal service obligation to deliver to every address in the UK six days a week for the same price. \"We are honoured to provide the universal service to more than 29m addresses across the UK,\" she said. \"[It] can only be changed by a vote in both houses of parliament.\" Greene pleaded with her staff, who have rebelled against the sell-off plans, to \"continue to drive our business forward as we seek to realise our collective objectives\". \"These are times of significant change and we are asking a lot of our people,\" she acknowledged. The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents postal workers, has vowed to fight the sale, which it says will lead to a \"worse deal for customers, staff and thousands of small businesses dependent on the Royal Mail\". Dave Ward, CWU deputy general secretary, said the positive results were \"more compelling evidence of why Royal Mail should be kept in the public sector\". \"Privatisation isn't necessary and it would destabilise the workforce and the good progress being made. The support of the workforce is crucial to the success of the company.\" Michael Fallon, the business minister, has warned the union that the world's oldest postal service could be sold to sovereign wealth funds or other foreign buyers if the CWU continues to fight its flotation. He said the government was \"committed\" to the sale and Tuesday's results were \"another encouraging step\" towards it. The business secretary, Vince Cable, said there was \"no alternative\" to privatisation, and Royal Mail still faces a \"fundamental threat\" from email, texts and social media. Greene, a Canadian who joined Royal Mail three years ago from Canada Post, said she has held discussions with a number of \"high quality investors\" in Canada and the US and said it would be \"foolhardy\" not consider the sale of the company to foreign buyers. \"The IPO [initial public offering] market in the past few years has been quite unpredictable,\" she said. \"It would be foolhardy not to consider other options.\" She said she was disappointed with the union's \"philosophical\" stance against privatisation. \"They believe government ownership should continue even though it fell into a very deep hole,\" she said. Greene said that before Royal Mail embarked on its transformation plan, the company was \"20 years behind\" postal services in other countries. She indicated that Royal Mail workers will face further rounds of redundancies as the company \"has to be sized appropriately for the [declining] traffic we have to process\". She declined to state how many more jobs are likely to be lost, but said more than 50,000 have been cut over the past decade. Staff are due to collect 10% of the shares in the company, which could be worth \u00a31,500 for each employee, when it is privatised. However, the union said the government could not \"buy off\" postal workers with the vague offer of shares in the privatised company. \"That's not going to cut the mustard,\" said Billy Hayes, general secretary of the CWU. \"Our members don't want \u00a31,500 if it is going to result in depressed terms and conditions and another five streets on a delivery.\" Greene said profits would have been as high as \u00a3440m accounting for \"transformation costs\" of redundancy payments and other costs in reshaping the business, which is switching its focus from letters to parcels. \"Just over three years ago, our core UK business had significant cash outflows [ie was making losses],\" she said. \"Now, despite the challenging UK economic conditions, UKPIL [UK Parcels, International and Letters] contributes the majority of group operating profits.\" She said the boom in online shopping had boosted the company's parcel business, to account for almost half of revenues. The number of parcels delivered last year increased by 70m to 1.4bn. However, she said the letters business was suffering a \"structural decline\". On average 58m letters are sent every day, compared with 63m in 2011-12.",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares came within 130 points of their all time peak, following a revival in mining shares and a number of positive company updates, but cruise company <strong>Carnival</strong> missed out on the rally.</p> <p>Its shares sank nearly 6%, down 143p to \u00a322.67, after a profit warning late on Monday. The trouble hit-company cut its earnings outlook for the second time in three months, as it cut ticket prices to attract customers following a series of high profile problems.</p> <p>Since the beginning of 2012, when one of its ships capsized off the Italian coast killing 32 people, other vessels have run into trouble, including the Carnival Triumph drifting for five days in the Gulf of Mexico without electricity or sufficient sanitation.</p> <p>The company said it now expects earnings per share to be between $1.45 and $1.65 compared to previous guidance of $1.80 to $2.10. As well as reduced ticket prices, the company pointed to increased voyage cancellations.</p> <p>But overall, a last minute jump pushed the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> past its 2007 peak of 6798, following comments from US Federal Reserve member James Bullard that central bank bond buying should continue. Bank actions to boost the global economy have lifted shares to new heights, but ahead of a testimony by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday, investors had been concerned that the money taps might soon be turned off. Bullard's comments seemed to play down that worry.</p> <p>So the FTSE 100 finished up 48.24 points at 6803.87, its highest level since the record high of 6930 on 30 December 1999, the peak of the dotcom boom. Better than expected UK inflation figures also prompted hopes of further QE measures from the Bank of England. Alex Young , senior sales trader at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote> In a technical sense markets are beginning to look a little over extended, and the potential for profit taking to trigger a market correction has to be a consideration for even the most fervent bulls. That said, as the clich\u00e9 goes, markets can remain over extended for a lot longer than retail traders can remain solvent.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares came within 130 points of their all time peak, following a revival in mining shares and a number of positive company updates, but cruise company Carnival missed out on the rally. Its shares sank nearly 6%, down 143p to \u00a322.67, after a profit warning late on Monday. The trouble hit-company cut its earnings outlook for the second time in three months, as it cut ticket prices to attract customers following a series of high profile problems. Since the beginning of 2012, when one of its ships capsized off the Italian coast killing 32 people, other vessels have run into trouble, including the Carnival Triumph drifting for five days in the Gulf of Mexico without electricity or sufficient sanitation. The company said it now expects earnings per share to be between $1.45 and $1.65 compared to previous guidance of $1.80 to $2.10. As well as reduced ticket prices, the company pointed to increased voyage cancellations. But overall, a last minute jump pushed the FTSE 100 past its 2007 peak of 6798, following comments from US Federal Reserve member James Bullard that central bank bond buying should continue. Bank actions to boost the global economy have lifted shares to new heights, but ahead of a testimony by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday, investors had been concerned that the money taps might soon be turned off. Bullard's comments seemed to play down that worry. So the FTSE 100 finished up 48.24 points at 6803.87, its highest level since the record high of 6930 on 30 December 1999, the peak of the dotcom boom. Better than expected UK inflation figures also prompted hopes of further QE measures from the Bank of England. Alex Young , senior sales trader at CMC Markets UK, said: In a technical sense markets are beginning to look a little over extended, and the potential for profit taking to trigger a market correction has to be a consideration for even the most fervent bulls. That said, as the clich\u00e9 goes, markets can remain over extended for a lot longer than retail traders can remain solvent. As ever, caution is advised when fighting the trend.

    "webTitle": "Vodafone reports first ever fall in revenues as southern Europe slumps", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vodafone has recorded its first ever fall in annual revenues after the recession in southern Europe caused its income there to dip by almost 17%. With its finances under pressure, the British mobile phone company said it would reinvest next month's \u00a32.1bn dividend from US subsidiary Verizon Wireless in the business rather than return cash to shareholders. Overall revenues fell 4.2% to \u00a344.4bn, marking the first such contraction since Vodafone was spun off from Racal as an independent company on the London and New York stock exchanges in 1991. Tuesday's results also marked the largest fall in organic service revenue since the measure was introduced in 2003. It counts income from calls but excludes handset sales and takes into account mergers and disposals, and currency changes. The company wrote down the value of its businesses by \u00a31.8bn, bringing to \u00a37.7bn the reduction in book value of its operations in Italy and Spain this year. Amid the financial gloom, Vodafone has delayed plans to switch on 4G in Britain, saying it wants to ensure its network will be ready. The service, for which Vodafone spent \u00a3790m on spectrum in February's government airwaves auction, had been expected to go live in May or June, but will now come at the end of the summer. \"We have faced headwinds from a combination of continued tough economic conditions, particularly in southern Europe, and an adverse European regulatory environment,\" said the Vodafone chief executive, Vittorio Colao. Regulation has been gradually reducing the cost of connections to mobile phones in recent years, bringing down service revenues for operators. Colao gave no update on Vodafone's discussions over selling all or part of the 45% stake in its US network to co-owner Verizon Communications. Investor hopes of a big dividend from a potential $130bn (\u00a385bn) cash and shares deal have boosted Vodafone shares in recent months. \"If an offer comes that is more advantageous than the current situation of course we will be open to it,\" said Colao. Analyst Jerry Dellis at Jefferies bank said the decision not to return any of the Verizon dividend to shareholders was \"disappointing and a break with previous policy\". There have been suggestions Verizon Communications, which has the power to veto payouts from their shared mobile business, could block further dividends this year as it attempts to wrest control of the asset. Vodafone's ordinary final dividend will rise to 6.92p, a 7% increase this year and a 22% increaserise over the past three years. The firm said it would \"at least maintain\" the ordinary dividend per share at current levels. With results slightly better than City forecasters had feared, the shares rose about 1% to 199.7p during late trading on Tuesday. Operating profit was \u00a312.3bn, comfortably above the top of the range set by the company last May. Vodafone guided that profit next year would be between \u00a312bn and \u00a312.8bn. Revenue from internet connections rose 13.8%, while major emerging markets remained buoyant, with India up nearly 11% and Turkey up 17%. Vodafone said it would continue investing to build video-quality networks across Europe so that it could manage the high demand for data from smartphones, and extend 4G coverage across 40% of its networks in its top five European markets by March next year.",

Investor hopes of a big dividend from a potential $130bn (\u00a385bn) cash and shares deal have boosted Vodafone shares in recent months.</p> <p>\"If an offer comes that is more advantageous than the current situation of course we will be open to it,\" said Colao.</p> <p>Analyst Jerry Dellis at Jefferies bank said the decision not to return any of the Verizon dividend to shareholders was \"disappointing and a break with previous policy\". There have been suggestions Verizon Communications, which has the power to veto payouts from their shared mobile business, could block further dividends this year as it attempts to wrest control of the asset.</p> <p>Vodafone's ordinary final dividend will rise to 6.92p, a 7% increase this year and a 22% increaserise over the past three years. The firm said it would \"at least maintain\" the ordinary dividend per share at current levels.</p> <p>With results slightly better than City forecasters had feared, the shares rose about 1% to 199.7p during late trading on Tuesday.</p> <p>Operating profit was \u00a312.3bn, comfortably above the top of the range set by the company last May. Vodafone guided that profit next year would be between \u00a312bn and \u00a312.8bn.</p> <p>Revenue from internet connections rose 13.8%, while major emerging markets remained buoyant, with India up nearly 11% and Turkey up 17%.</p> <p>Vodafone said it would continue investing to build video-quality networks across Europe so that it could manage the high demand for data from smartphones, and extend 4G coverage across 40% of its networks in its top five European markets by March next year.</p>",
