    "webTitle": "ECB gets ready to pump cash into eurozone as fears rise over recovery", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank is accelerating plans to unleash fresh growth-boosting measures as the eurozone's recovery loses steam and the risk increases of a geopolitical shock from the Ukraine crisis. Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, said that the Bank had \"intensified preparatory work\" on quantitative easing as a potential new weapon in its battle against deflation and economic stagnation. He revealed that the eurozone's policymakers were closer to using QE \u2013 which would inject cash into the eurozone by acquiring assets such as bonds from financial institutions \u2013 amid worrying signs that weak growth in the 18-member currency bloc is slowing further still. \"The recovery remains weak, fragile and uneven. In recent weeks, the data shows growth momentum is slowing down. It is quite clear that if geopolitical risks materialise, the next two quarters will show lower growth.\" Recovery in the region is barely established, with GDP increasing by only 0.2% in the first quarter of the year. Speaking at a press conference in Frankfurt, Draghi said sanctions and counter sanctions between the west and Russia were among the biggest risks facing the eurozone economy, with the potential to drive energy prices higher and depress exports. He stressed it was too early to say what the precise impact sanctions would have on the region. \"We are just at the beginning. We are still assessing what impact sanctions might have on the economy. \"Geopolitical risks are heightened. And some of them, like the situation in Ukraine and Russia will have a greater impact on the euro area than they \u2026 have on other parts of the world.\" Earlier, the ECB's governing council left rates on hold at its July policy meeting, as expected. The Bank delivered a raft of stimulative measures in June, but stopped short of announcing QE to breathe some life into the single currency bloc's economy and stave off the threat of a dangerous deflationary spiral. Eurozone inflation fell to a near five-year low of 0.4% in July, dragged lower by accelerating falls in food, alcohol and tobacco prices, and a sharp drop in energy prices. Deflation is dangerous for economies as it encourages companies to delay spending in the expectation that prices will fall further, creating a spiral of slumping demand and further falls in prices. The main interest rate was cut to a record low of 0.15% in June and the deposit rate was cut to -0.1% \u2013 meaning banks have to pay to park cash with the ECB in the hope it will encourage them to lend more to businesses and consumers. The central bank also announced a \u20ac400bn (\u00a3317bn) package of cheap funding with the condition that the money is used to lend to companies outside the financial sector, and not for mortgages. Draghi said on Thursday that those measures announced in June had been \"successful\" so far. He stressed that markets were expecting rates in the eurozone to remain very low for much longer than in the US. The ECB is pumping more stimulus into the eurozone as central banks in the US and the UK prepare to tighten policy. The euro weakened against the dollar and the pound after his comments, and Europe's main stock markets were down. He said the countries that had undertaken structural reforms were doing better than those that had not undertaken reforms, or those that had undertaken only limited reforms. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, said that recent data had disappointed. \"Despite buoyant leading indicators, an easing of austerity and some lessening of the peripheral credit crunch, the economy now seems to be expanding more slowly than in mid-2013.\" Italy slipped back into recession this week, the French economy is flat, and Schmieding said Germany's economy might have contracted slightly in the second quarter after growth of 0.8% in the first three months of the year. Escalating tensions in Russia threaten to weigh on business confidence and exports in Germany particularly \u2013 Russia's largest trading partner in the European Union. The weakening outlook for Italy and Germany prompted Berenberg to downgrade its eurozone growth forecast from 1% to 0.8% in 2014, and from 1.6% to 1.4% in 2015. The first official estimate for eurozone growth in the second quarter will be published next week by the EU's statistics office, Eurostat. Draghi said the action taken to prevent the collapse of Portugal's Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo was \"swift and effective\" and played down the suggestion that it was a worrying sign that there were still deep problems lurking in the eurozone's banking system that could plunge the region back into a full-blown crisis.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Co-operative Group set to offer concessions on board structure", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group is on Friday expected to publish detailed proposals to change the way it is run and is thought to be offering crucial concessions on its board structure. Overturning ideas set out by the former City minister Lord Myners, who had recommended removing all the democratically elected members of the Co-op from the board, the troubled mutual is expected to offer those members up to three seats on a new-look board. After weeks of discussions following the annual meeting in May, when members agreed in principle to an overhaul but not to the detail, the proposals being published will be put to a vote at a special meeting on 30 August. The Co-op chair, Ursula Lidbetter, is expected to urge members to back them. Myners, a former chairman of Guardian Media Group, had recommended an overhaul of the board, which is currently populated entirely by Co-op members. The seven million members of the Co-op who own 78% of the group have 15 seats on the board, with five seats held by representatives of the independent societies, which own the rest of the loss-making business. He had been brought in after the group was hit by the upheaval in its banking arm, which needed a \u00a31.5bn capital injection and saw its former chairman, Paul Flowers, mired in a drugs controversy. But Myners quit in the face of opposition to his plans, which included replacing the board with an independent chair, members of the management team, including the chief executive, and independent non-executive directors, with no room for elected members. The boardroom structure was voted on at the May AGM, when members had agreed to back four principles for reform based on recommendations made by Myners: a board elected by members that is qualified to run a business the size of the Co-op; create a structure that gives the members powers to hold the board to account; establish a system of one member one vote; and protect the Co-op against demutualisation. But since then, the group has been locked in discussions about devising proposals that will win the support of the members ahead of the vote later this month. The Co-op declined to comment. The changes to Myners' boardroom proposal are among ways the management hopes to win support for the overhaul. The Co-op has said an agreement on reform would clear the way for a new chief executive to be appointed to replace Euan Sutherland, who quit in March when details of his \u00a36.6m pay deal were leaked. The regional boards which represent the members will have to vote on the proposals, which have also caused controversy because Myners recommended scrapping the regional boards and replacing them with a members' council with an elected president and a nominations committee to decide on boardroom appointments. Activists argue that unless elected members \u2013 known as democrats \u2013 have a say over who sits on the nominations committee the co-operative ethos will be lost. It is thought a temporary boardroom structure will be created while a new board is assembled, which will involve creating a \"senate\" under which the current board members would retain their positions until May 2016. Lidbetter is expected to clarify her role on Friday. By scheduling the vote for 30 August, the board will be hoping to win backing for the proposals ahead of the publication of interim results currently scheduled for September 3. The management team, currently led by interim boss Richard Pennycook who stepped in to the top role when Sunderland quit, has pressed on with selling the pharmacies and the farms to raise cash to help ease a \u00a31.4bn debt pile. Security business Sunwin is also on the block while the stake in the troubling banking arm has fallen to just 20%.",

      "body": "<p>The Co-operative Group is on Friday expected to publish detailed proposals to change the way it is run and is thought to be offering crucial concessions on its board structure.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/07/lord-myners-cooperative-group-radical-overhaul\" title=\"\">Overturning ideas set out by the former City minister Lord Myners</a>, who had recommended removing all the democratically elected members of the Co-op from the board, the troubled mutual is expected to offer those members up to three seats on a new-look board.</p> <p>After weeks of discussions following<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/18/co-operative-group-backs-lord-myners-reforms\" title=\"\"> the annual meeting in May</a>, when members agreed in principle to an overhaul but not to the detail, the proposals being published will be put to a vote at a special meeting on 30 August. The Co-op chair, Ursula Lidbetter, is expected to urge members to back them.</p> <p>Myners, a former chairman of Guardian Media Group, had recommended an overhaul of the board, which is currently populated entirely by Co-op members. The seven million members of the Co-op who own 78% of the group have 15 seats on the board, with five seats held by representatives of the independent societies, which own the rest of the loss-making business.</p> <p>He had been brought in after the group was hit by the upheaval in its banking arm, which needed a \u00a31.5bn capital injection and saw its former chairman, Paul Flowers, mired in a drugs controversy. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/09/lord-myners-quits-co-op-group\" title=\"\">Myners quit in the face of opposition to his plans</a>, which included replacing the board with an independent chair, members of the management team, including the chief executive, and independent non-executive directors, with no room for elected members.</p> <p>The boardroom structure was voted on at the May AGM, when members had agreed to back four principles for reform based on recommendations made by Myners: a board elected by members that is qualified to run a business the size of the Co-op; create a structure that gives the members powers to hold the board to account; establish a system of one member one vote; and protect the Co-op against demutualisation.</p> <p>But since then, the group has been locked in discussions about devising proposals that will win the support of the members ahead of the vote later this month. The Co-op declined to comment.</p> <p>The changes to Myners' boardroom proposal are among ways the management hopes to win support for the overhaul. The Co-op has said an agreement on reform would clear the way for a new chief executive to be appointed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/11/co-operative-group-chief-executive-euan-sutherland-resign\" title=\"\">replace Euan Sutherland, who quit in March</a> when details of his \u00a36.6m pay deal were leaked.</p> <p>The regional boards which represent the members will have to vote on the proposals, which have also caused controversy because Myners recommended scrapping the regional boards and replacing them with a members' council with an elected president and a nominations committee to decide on boardroom appointments.</p> <p>Activists argue that unless elected members \u2013 known as democrats \u2013 have a say over who sits on the nominations committee the co-operative ethos will be lost.</p> <p>It is thought a temporary boardroom structure will be created while a new board is assembled, which will involve creating a \"senate\" under which the current board members would retain their positions until May 2016. Lidbetter is expected to clarify her role on Friday. By scheduling the vote for 30 August, the board will be hoping to win backing for the proposals ahead of the publication of interim results currently scheduled for September 3.</p> <p>The management team, currently led by interim boss Richard Pennycook who stepped in to the top role when Sunderland quit, has pressed on with selling the pharmacies and the farms to raise cash to help ease a \u00a31.4bn debt pile. Security business Sunwin is also on the block while the stake in the troubling banking arm has fallen to just 20%.</p>",

S&amp;P cut its rating on the company by one notch with its analysts pointing to a picture of deteriorating sales and profitability. \"The downgrade reflects our view that Tesco's profitability will continue to weaken because market competition in the UK will remain persistently high, and even intensify, over the next 12 months,\" it said in a note. \"Tesco's market and financial positions have not tangibly improved, despite extensive restructuring and substantial spending on a long-term program to improve its stores and customer service.\" Last month Tesco announced that chief executive Philip Clarke was being replaced by the Unilever executive \u2013 the first outsider to lead the business \u2013 in October. At the same time the company warned sales and trading profits for the first half of the year \"were below expectations\". During a three-year tenure Clarke ploughed more than \u00a31bn into revamping its UK supermarkets and product ranges, yet failed to stem the tide of shopper defections to discount rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. When Clarke took over in March 2011 Tesco's UK market share was 30.7%, but that has now shrunk to 28.9%, according to research firm Kantar Worldpanel. \"We anticipate that increased competitive and price pressures in the UK from both traditional and discount retailers could suppress any benefits from various management strategies oriented toward improving trading performance,\" continued S&amp;P's analysts who added they did see a \"material turnaround\" in Tesco's international operations this year or next. The downgrade meant Tesco's rating was lowered from \"BBB+\" to \"BBB\" \u2013 one notch above the lowest investment grade - with a \"negative outlook\". The outlook reflects S&amp;P's view that lower profitability could lead to a further deterioration in its credit worthiness. Earlier this week HSBC analyst Dave McCarthy warned Lewis was taking on the \"biggest turnaround project in British retail history\" with \"drastic action\" required to reverse its declining fortunes. \"We expect Tesco to cut UK profits, dividends and capex by circa 50%,\" he predicted of Lewis's turnaround plan. \"These cuts look extreme but we suspect Tesco is in worse shape than first appears.\" He also predicted Lewis could sell off peripheral activities such as movie streaming service BlinkBox and restaurant chain Giraffe as it refocuses on being a \"grocer to the mass market\".

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, is thought to be preparing his exit from the bailed-out bank amid mounting expectations he will move to the same role at GlaxoSmithKline. The switch by Hampton to the top role at Britain's biggest pharmaceutical company is expected to be confirmed next month. He would replace Sir Christopher Gent, the current chairman, who has indicated he intends to stand down at the end of 2015 after almost 10 years in the role at the pharmaceutical company, which is battling for its reputation in the midst of bribery allegations. The RBS chairman has been facing questions about his intentions to remain at the 81% taxpayer-owned bank since Stephen Hester quit as chief executive in June 2012. At the time Hampton said he had \"no imminent plans\" to quit until Hester's replacement had \"their feet under the table\". Hester's successor Ross McEwan has now been at the helm of the bank for a year, while Hampton's remarks that a chairman should serve between five and seven years have been interpreted as meaning he would seek to leave after the bank's annual meeting in 2015. If he does take the chairman's seat at GSK, which Sky News reported would be confirmed next month, he will joining a business facing severe reputational challenges. The trial is due to start on Friday in Shanghai of the private investigators brought in to investigate a covert sex tape of the former head the pharmaceutical company's China division. The secretly filmed video of Mark Reilly and his Chinese girlfriend in his Shanghai flat was sent to GSK executives while Reilly was accused by the local authorities of running a bribery network. The investigators brought in by GSK \u2013 Peter Humphrey, a Briton, and his wife Yu Yingzeng, an American national \u2013 are now facing trial for illegally purchasing information about Chinese nationals. The allegations of bribery sparked the GSK chief executive Andrew Witty to declare the company had a \"zero tolerance\" approach to any attempts at corrupt sales practices of the type it faces in China and other countries in which it operates. However, GSK also faces of bribing doctors in Poland, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. In May, the Serious Fraud Office said it had launched a formal criminal investigation into GlaxoSmithKline's sales practices. For Hampton to take up the chairman's role at GSK he would likely be appointed to the board as non-executive director first with his elevation to the chairman's seat at a later point in 2015. A former corporate financier, Hampton has held a number of roles in the boardrooms of major companies including finance director of British Steel and a short stint at Lloyds before the 2008 banking crisis. He was chairman of supermarket group J Sainsbury when he was parachuted in to chair RBS after its \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout. The government is yet to sell off any of its stake in RBS and had indicated that it does intend to do so before May 2015, unlike Lloyds Banking Group where a 43% stake has been cut to 24%. Hampton last month oversaw the release of RBS's interim results a week early because of better than expected profits of \u00a32.6bn \u2013 the highest since the 2008 bail out. Hester, who left RBS a year ago, joined troubled insurer RSA in February and on Thursday reported a return to profitability after being hit by problems its Irish arm.",

      "body": "<p>Before the sex tape, there were the emails. They came sporadically throughout the first two months of 2013 \u2013 long, unsigned, highly detailed missives alleging malfeasance at the China office of UK pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. The sender was \"gskwhistleblower\". Recipients included the chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, and 12 other GSK executives.</p> <p>They received the sex tape in March. The male subject was clearly the company's then China boss, Mark Reilly, 52, who had been living in Shanghai since 2009. The tape had been filmed surreptitiously in his guarded luxury home. The woman was his Chinese girlfriend, a young secretary at a travel company.</p> <p>Reilly was troubled and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/30/glaxosmithkline-pharmaceuticals-industry\" title=\"\">GSK approved an investigation</a>, so he called in Peter Humphrey, a UK citizen, and his American wife, Yu Yingzeng, known as two of the best corporate detectives in China. They had operated the small firm <a href=\"http://chinawhys.com/\" title=\"\">ChinaWhys</a> since 2003, conducting \"wide-ranging discreet inquiries into difficult commercial matters\", according to the firm's website. Humphrey had previously spent two decades as a foreign correspondent for Reuters, based in Asia and eastern Europe, before breaking into corporate investigation. Yu, 61, was trained as a forensic accountant.</p> <p>Humphrey, 58, has a round, affable face; he wears gold wire-frame spectacles beneath a shock of salt-and-pepper grey hair. Reilly offered him \u00a320,000 from GSK's coffers to find out how the camera had ended up in his home. Humphrey named the investigation \"Project Scorpion\" and spent months reviewing the emails. Although he never found a definitive answer, bit by bit, he began to suspect the corruption claims \u2013 accusations that health officials had been bribed to buy GSK drugs \u2013 were true.</p> <p>The couple had planned for the GSK investigation to be one of their last jobs in China. Their 19-year-old son was to attend university in the UK, and they hoped to move back too. But last summer their world came crashing down. In late June, authorities raided GSK's China headquarters in Shanghai, confiscating documents and detaining employees. Over six years, they said, GSK may have spent \u00a3285m on bribing doctors and hospital officials to sell their drugs.</p> <p>On 10 July, the authorities ransacked the ChinaWhys office and detained the couple on suspicion of \"running an illegal company\". Humphrey and Yu \"illegally trafficked a huge amount of personal information on Chinese citizens to seek profits\", state media reports said.</p> <p>A few weeks later, they appeared on state-run television. \"To obtain this information, I sometimes used illegal means,\" Humphrey said, handcuffed and in an orange prison vest. \"I'm extremely repentant for this, and want to apologise to the Chinese government.\"</p> <p>Humphrey and Yu go on trial on Friday accused of illegally purchasing personal information about Chinese nationals, an unprecedented charge for foreigners in China. Last week, their son, Harvey, was allowed to visit them at Pudong detention centre in Shanghai for the first time since their arrest. Both had lost a lot of weight, he said. Yu was emotional \u2013 \"shocked\" to see her son. They discussed books she had read in prison, mainly tomes on philosophy and US politics that she was given by consular officials. \"I guess she uses them as a psychological barrier,\" Harvey said. Humphrey was was more stoic, advising him on practical matters: arranging his tuition fee status for university, managing family assets. \"We did touch on GSK very briefly,\" Harvey said. \"I did mention Reilly to my dad, and he expressed a very low opinion of him.\"</p> <p>Throughout the fiasco, one figure has lurked in the background: Vivian Shi, GSK's former government relations manager. Reilly suspected she was the whistleblower, although she has denied it. Shi spent four years at the company, but left in December 2012, shortly before GSK executives began receiving the emails. She is supposedly well-connected in public security, and her father was a senior communist in Shanghai.

      "bodyText": "Before the sex tape, there were the emails. They came sporadically throughout the first two months of 2013 \u2013 long, unsigned, highly detailed missives alleging malfeasance at the China office of UK pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. The sender was \"gskwhistleblower\". Recipients included the chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, and 12 other GSK executives. They received the sex tape in March. The male subject was clearly the company's then China boss, Mark Reilly, 52, who had been living in Shanghai since 2009. The tape had been filmed surreptitiously in his guarded luxury home. The woman was his Chinese girlfriend, a young secretary at a travel company. Reilly was troubled and GSK approved an investigation, so he called in Peter Humphrey, a UK citizen, and his American wife, Yu Yingzeng, known as two of the best corporate detectives in China. They had operated the small firm ChinaWhys since 2003, conducting \"wide-ranging discreet inquiries into difficult commercial matters\", according to the firm's website. Humphrey had previously spent two decades as a foreign correspondent for Reuters, based in Asia and eastern Europe, before breaking into corporate investigation. Yu, 61, was trained as a forensic accountant. Humphrey, 58, has a round, affable face; he wears gold wire-frame spectacles beneath a shock of salt-and-pepper grey hair. Reilly offered him \u00a320,000 from GSK's coffers to find out how the camera had ended up in his home. Humphrey named the investigation \"Project Scorpion\" and spent months reviewing the emails. Although he never found a definitive answer, bit by bit, he began to suspect the corruption claims \u2013 accusations that health officials had been bribed to buy GSK drugs \u2013 were true. The couple had planned for the GSK investigation to be one of their last jobs in China. Their 19-year-old son was to attend university in the UK, and they hoped to move back too. But last summer their world came crashing down. In late June, authorities raided GSK's China headquarters in Shanghai, confiscating documents and detaining employees. Over six years, they said, GSK may have spent \u00a3285m on bribing doctors and hospital officials to sell their drugs. On 10 July, the authorities ransacked the ChinaWhys office and detained the couple on suspicion of \"running an illegal company\". Humphrey and Yu \"illegally trafficked a huge amount of personal information on Chinese citizens to seek profits\", state media reports said. A few weeks later, they appeared on state-run television. \"To obtain this information, I sometimes used illegal means,\" Humphrey said, handcuffed and in an orange prison vest. \"I'm extremely repentant for this, and want to apologise to the Chinese government.\" Humphrey and Yu go on trial on Friday accused of illegally purchasing personal information about Chinese nationals, an unprecedented charge for foreigners in China. Last week, their son, Harvey, was allowed to visit them at Pudong detention centre in Shanghai for the first time since their arrest. Both had lost a lot of weight, he said. Yu was emotional \u2013 \"shocked\" to see her son. They discussed books she had read in prison, mainly tomes on philosophy and US politics that she was given by consular officials. \"I guess she uses them as a psychological barrier,\" Harvey said. Humphrey was was more stoic, advising him on practical matters: arranging his tuition fee status for university, managing family assets. \"We did touch on GSK very briefly,\" Harvey said. \"I did mention Reilly to my dad, and he expressed a very low opinion of him.\" Throughout the fiasco, one figure has lurked in the background: Vivian Shi, GSK's former government relations manager. Reilly suspected she was the whistleblower, although she has denied it. Shi spent four years at the company, but left in December 2012, shortly before GSK executives began receiving the emails. She is supposedly well-connected in public security, and her father was a senior communist in Shanghai. Humphrey was jailed soon after she learned of the investigation. \"[Humphrey] hit a nerve in this investigation, a really deep nerve,\" said Kerry Brown, a Chinese politics expert at the University of Sydney and a former diplomat in Beijing. \"And when this happens to somebody with his experience in China \u2013 a real professional \u2013 it makes you take a breath and go, no one can really say that they are invulnerable in this market.\" Reilly, who remains a GSK employee, was in the UK when GSK's China headquarters were raided, but returned to aid the investigation. He was barred from leaving and remains in China; his movements are restricted. In May, prosecutors accused him of overseeing a \"massive bribery network\". If found guilty, he could spend years in jail. \"For the foreign business community in China, for a long time, there was a feeling that the worst that could happen is you'd get kicked out,\" said Duncan Clark, the head of BDA China, a consultancy in Beijing, and former chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China. \"That's over, clearly.\" For GSK, there is a lot on the line.

      "bodyText": "Adidas is planning its biggest-ever advertising campaign next year as it fights back against rival Nike. The world's second-largest sportswear maker has admitted that it needs to invest more in its brands to catch up with market leader Nike, after losing ground in developed markets. Herbert Hainer, the chief executive of the German company, promised the \"most ambitious\" brand campaign in the company's history for 2015. \"It is with disappointment that after such a great summer of sport, I have to report that our group has not been able to meet the high expectations we laid out,\" he said. \"We take full responsibility to rectify our shortfalls swiftly.\" He added: \"We need to raise our game. I'm a striker and I want to win. It is obvious that we will have to go back to the training ground.\" Hainer said Adidas would lift its marketing budget from 13% to 14% of sales in 2015, raising it by up to \u20ac200m (\u00a3159m). Adidas on Thursday cut its profit margin outlook for this year after a 13% slide in operating profits to \u20ac220m in the second quarter. It took a hit from volatile emerging markets currencies, in particular the weaker Russian rouble, coupled with disappointing golf sales. It plans to restructure its golf arm, TaylorMade, at which sales fell by 18%, but Hainer refused to give details on job cuts. The company already lowered its sales and profit estimates last week despite receiving a boost from the World Cup in Brazil, the advent of which is expected to lead to record sales of \u20ac2bn in football products \u2013 from replica shirts to footballs. Adidas sold more than 14m of the official World Cup \"Brazuca\" balls, and more than 8m football jerseys. It kitted out nine teams, including champions Germany as well as Argentina and Colombia. Adidas recently won a 10-year contract to be Manchester United's kit sponsor for a record-breaking minimum guarantee of \u00a3750m. The deal will kick in at the start of the 2015-16 season, ending Nike's 13-year relationship with the club. Nearly two-thirds of its sales are made through third-party retailers, but Adidas has now invested in opening more of its own shops because they are more profitable. However, it has scaled back store openings in Russia, where it runs about 1,000 shops. Russia is its third-biggest market. The escalating crisis in Ukraine has made Russians more reluctant to shop. The company's shares tumbled more than 11% after last week's profit warning and traded down 3.5% Thursday afternoon. Adidas expects to make a profit of \u20ac650m this year, down from the \u20ac820m to \u20ac930m previously forecast. Analysts at Citi said they remained sceptical about the outlook for the stock, given the scaled-back investment in Russia, higher marketing costs and adverse currency trends.",

FTSE 100 down 0.1%, or 7 points at 6630 France CAC 40 down 0.2% Germany Dax up 0.27% Spain IBEX down 0.7% Italy FTSE MIB down 0.1% And we\u2019re done. A summary of the key points from the ECB press conference: Draghi says the ECB has hired a consultant to design an ABS purchase programme (or quantitative easing by any other name). This has been done with the expectation of using it but no final decision has been taken. He says the EU is an unfinished union and that the introduction of a capital markets union is \u201clikely\u201d. This sounds rather like the introduction of eurobonds. He says the measures announced by the ECB in June have been successful, in interest rate and liquidity terms and help with the euro, but not in terms of inflation. He insists on stability of medium-long term inflationary expectations, but says short-term inflationary expectations have declined. We\u2019ve found out Draghi is off to Italy on holiday! Draghi\u2019s response: What the Portuguese authorities have done, they certainly took swift action on that case [of Banco Espirito Santo]. Both they and the European competition arm worked very well together. The market reaction in and out of Portugal confirmed this view that authorities had been swift and effective. What could have been a systemic incident is seen as an incident that is restricted to this bank and this bank\u2019s owners. It is an episode which is being contained and has not affected the banking sector in Portugal, nor the markets at large, nor outside of Portugal. How did noone notice that Banco Espirito Santo was a problem? asks one journalist Draghi: Fundamentals for a weaker exchange rate are today much better than a couple of months ago. Draghi says one of the components of low GDP in Italy is low private investment. This is not a result of the cost of capital, because money is cheap. He puts it down to the lack of structural reforms in the country, which \u201cdiscourages investments\u201d. This monetary union is an unfinished union - Draghi He says it is \u201clikely\u201d that the ECB will make further progress on a capital markets union. When the crisis erupted the ECB was still a young institution. The crisis was and still is an extraordinary time, required the use of extraordinary instruments. We use extraordinary instruments to respond to extraordinary needs always within our mandate - to maintain price stability. The ECB was not alone in overestimating inflation. To some extent much of the fact of inflation being lower than expected was due to food and energy prices, and then due to exchange rate developments. - Draghi The countries that have undertaken a convincing programme of structural reforms are performing much better than the countries that have not done so or have done so to a limited extent - Draghi. The recovery remains weak, fragile and uneven. There has been a slowing down in the growth momentum - Draghi. Draghi says inflation expectations are firmly anchored, reports to the contrary are inaccurate. He clarifies that long-term inflation expectations are unchanged, they have declined in the short-term. The ECB is hiring a consultant to help design a programme to buy asset-backed securities. Draghi\u2019s introductory statement. Draghi \u2013 We\u2019re still assessing the possible impact of sanctions on the euro area economy. We see risks especially from the price of energy. It is difficult to define what are the options in the future, especially if the conflict were to escalate. Our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative. He say the ECB will use QE if the medium-term outlook changes. Draghi - If you look at the world today you will see that geo-political risks have increased all over the world. Russia, Iraq, Gaza, Libya. Some of them like the situation in Russia will have a greater impact on the euro area than they will on other places in the world. It\u2019s hard to assess the impact. If one looks at trade, there are limited interconnections. Even looking at the main financial institutions, there are less than a handful of financial institutions very closely linked with Russia. The TLTRO \u2013 ultra-cheap, four-year loan program \u2013 will enhance the ECB\u2019s monetary policy stance because they will be used to fund the real economy. Draghi expects a sizeable pick-up. Draghi says important structural reforms have increased competitiveness in the euro area. These should not be unravelled. Euro area banks reported an improvement in demand for loans by non financial corporations and households - Draghi Draghi will closely monitor the possible repercussions of heightened geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments on outlook for price stability Euro area annual inflation was 0.4% in July 2014, after 0.5% in June. This reflects lower energy price inflation. The other main components remained broadly unchanged. On basis of current information it is expected to remain low for the coming months, increasing gradually through 2015, 2016. Risks remain on the downside - heightened geo-political risks, may have the potential to affect economic conditions. Could hit prices and demand for euro area products. But unemployment remains high. \u201cThe progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms and gains in real disposable income should make a positive contribution to economic growth.\u201d In the first quarter GDP rose by 0.2%, in second quarter monthly indicators ahve been volatile. Overall survey data is consistent with a \u201ccontinued moderate and uneven recovery in the euro area economy\u201d. Key interest rates will remain at present levels \u201cfor an extended period of time\u201d. He expects the easing measures announced last month to help inflation get back closer to 2%. Draghi says inflation expectations are firmly anchored. He expects a continued moderate recovery in the eurozone, with low rates of inflation and subdued monetary and credit dyanmics. Expectations of maintaing inflation rates below but close to 2%. ECB president Mario Draghi has arrived for his press conference where we are expecting him to talk about the impact of the crisis in Ukraine on the eurozone. Watch live here. More reaction to Russia\u2019s import ban... The ECB has left rates on hold, as expected. In June, the bank cut its main refinancing to a record low of 0.15 per cent and put its deposit rate in negative territory, charging banks 0.1% on a portion of their reserves parked at the bank. It also launched a new ultra-cheap, four-year loan program, dubbed TLTROs, to be rolled out later this year. RBS points out that market opinion on when rates will rise has shifted forwards since the beginning of the year... But wage growth in the UK is amazingly low compared with the 40-year average. Chris Williamson at Markit says it\u2019s all about when wage growth starts to pick up. If pay starts to rise in coming months, the first rate hike looks likely in November. Otherwise, any tightening of policy can wait until next year. The British Chambers of Commerce is banging the drum for the MPC to sit tight. The MPC made the right decision to keep interest rates and quantitative easing on hold. The UK\u2019s economic recovery remains on track but is still facing challenges and this is not the time to put it at risk with premature rate increases. The current calls for higher rates, particularly while wage pressures are still weak, are unjustified. Official figures show that a large number of people are working part time because they are unable to find a full time job \u2013 refuting the view that there is no spare capacity in the economy. Captial Economics is betting on a rate rise in early 2015, saying: The key point is that the absence of inflationary pressure is likely to mean that the MPC will be able to raise rates only slowly over the next few years. The reaction is flooding in about the Bank of England decision to keep rates on hold. James Knightley at ING Markets said: Given we don\u2019t expect any significant loss of momentum for the UK economy over the rest of the year we favour a November rate hike from the BoE with very slow and steady additional tightening of perhaps 25bp per quarter thereafter. He expects to see one, possibly two members of the MPC having voted for a rate hike at today\u2019s meeting, but we won\u2019t find that out until the minutes are released on August 20. Howard Archer at Global Insight: No change in interest rates; No Bank of England statement; No surprise. A spike in consumer price inflation to 1.9% in June from 1.5% in May, ongoing appreciable falls in unemployment and further robust GDP growth of 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter are supportive to the case for raising interest rates before the end of 2014. However, ongoing very low earnings growth and some signs that growth could be losing a little momentum (notably, recent weaker news on the manufacturing sector as well as a dip in consumer confidence in July and softer retail sales in June) support the case for the Bank of England delaying any interest rate hike until 2015. On balance he settles for late 2014. The Bank of England has kept rates on hold at 0.5%. We\u2019ll find out if there was any split on the voting in two weeks time when they release the minutes. Tesco has been downgraded to just two notches above junk by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. The credit rating agency says the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket is suffering from \u201cpersistently high market competition\u201d and \u201cwill continue to see a trend of weaker profitability and top-line pressure\u201d. It downgraded the retailer\u2019s debt one notch to BBB, with a negative outlook. The analysts said: In a trading update which accompanied the appointment of its new CEO, Tesco has stated that because current trading conditions are more difficult than it anticipated, its sales and trading profit in the first half of the year are less than it expected. The negative outlook on Tesco reflects our view that the lower profitability could lead to further deterioration in credit metrics, beyond the levels we consider adequate for the current ratings. The European Commission has responded to Russia\u2019s import ban announcement. A spokesman said: The European Union regrets the announcement by the Russian Federation of measures which will target imports of food and agricultural products. This announcement is clearly politically motivated. The Commission will assess the measures in question as soon as we have more information as to their full content and extent. We underline that the European Union\u2019s restrictive measures are directly linked with the illegal annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of Ukraine. The European Union remains committed to de-escalating the situation in Ukraine. All should join in this effort. Following full assessment by the Commission of the Russian Federation\u2019s measures, we reserve the right to take action as appropriate. The markets react predictably to Russia\u2019s erratic behaviour. The price Russian companies will now have to pay to borrow money on the international markets has shot up. Yields (effectively the interest rate) on Russian corporate bonds are now at 7.2%, compared with 5.2% for corporate bonds across emerging markets as a whole. Power company Drax has lost its court of appeal ruling against the government, meaning one of its power stations will not be eligible for a lucrative subsidy. The company is in the process of converting Britain\u2019s largest coal-fired power plant to burn biomass, which is heavily subsidised. In December, the government said plans to convert two of its units would be eligible for subsidy contracts. But in April ministers unexpectedly disqualified one of the units, claiming it was ineligible. The shares are down 11% now, after Drax said it would not appeal the decision. The Russian import ban is largely futile, says the Economist. German submarines sank merchant shipping in both world wars to stop Britain from importing food. Russia presumably imports food from Europe because it is cheaper or of better quality; diverting resocurces to produce food at home will be less economically efficient. And what happens if they buy the food from Latin America or Asia? Well, those Latin American and Asian producers are currently selling the food to other non-Russian consumers. So those consumers will simply buy European and American goods themselves. It notes that not all sanctions are so easily got round. Russia could cut off gas exports to Europe but that would mean Russia would not get paid, making it another potential own goal. The main cost to Russia, as the column pointed out a couple of week ago, is that its erratic actions put off international investors, leading to lower asset prices and a higher cost of funding. In stockmarket terms alone, this effect is a trillion dollars. Impoverishing investors and making food more expensive; it\u2019s not an inspiring platform. There Bank of England might not be expected to announce a rate change today, but it\u2019s coming. Here\u2019s the guardian\u2019s story on Russia\u2019s import ban. Some quotes from Dmitry Medvedev\u2019s press conference, when he announced the ban on food imports from the west. He said: There is nothing good in sanctions and it was not an easy decision to take, but we had to do it. Medvedev also threatened a series of further counter-sanctions, including a proposal to ban European and American airlines from flying over Russia\u2019s territory. It doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll be adopted, but they are on the table. The government was also \u201cpotentially ready\u201d to introduce protective measures in a number of industrial sectors including the automobile industry, shipbuilding and aircraft production, he said. Greek unemployment eased slightly in May but it is still shockingly high. The country\u2019s statistics agency said the jobless rate inched down to 27.2% from 27.3% in April. That is more than double the eurozone average of 11.6% in May. Joblessness remains a major issue in Greece, despite signs of recovery in the economy, which is expected to emerge from recession this year. Companies are starting to feel the effects of the Russian turmoil. The world\u2019s number two bottler of Coca-Cola drinks warned volumes would fall for the rest of the year, citing a \u201csudden deterioration\u201d in Russia, its biggest market. It said volumes fell by a low single digit percentage in the second quarter, the first decline in 11 quarters, saying the escalation of the crisis in Russia and Ukraine had affected consumer spending in the region. Medvedev\u2019s announcement confirms Putin\u2019s comments yesterday, covered in my colleague Jennifer Rankin\u2019s story. She writes: Vladimir Putin has banned the import of agricultural goods from countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia in a tit-for-tat move that deepens the economic standoff between the Kremlin and the west. In tacit recognition that Russian consumers will bear the cost of the import ban, the decree also instructs officials to come up with measures to stabilise commodity markets and prevent food price rises. These bans from Russia will start from today and will last a year. Russia will ban transit flights for Ukranian airlines via its territory. It is also mulling a ban of transit flights for EU, US airlines to Asia-Pacific reigons. There are lines coming through on the wires on Russia\u2019s retaliatory measures to sanctions. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev says Russia will ban fruit, vegetable meat, fish, milk and dairy imports for the US, EU, Australia, Canada and Norway. Adidas, the world\u2019s second-biggest sportswear firm, cut its profit for 2014, saying it would increase spending on marketing and an expansion of its own-run stores a week after it issued a profit warning. Chief executive Herbert Hainer said: \u201cMissing our goals is something we take very seriously and we definitely reflect critically on\u201d. The company says Russian turmoil has hit trading: it now plans to open only 80 stores in Russia this year and next, down from 150. Rates are expected to be kept on hold at 0.5% when the Bank of England announces its policy decision at 12 noon. Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics says: Although the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) appears to have edged closer to raising interest rates over the last few months, it would still be a major shock if it raised them at its meeting today. And while the strength of the latest activity surveys suggests that the minutes later in the month may show that the vote was split for the first time since July 2011, the recent fading of momentum in house prices, downward trend in inflation and sluggish pay growth all suggest that the MPC will probably still wait until early next year to raise rates. It is the first meeting for Nemat (Minouche) Shafik, who ups the number of women on the nine-strong committee to two. Kristin Forbes, a former economic adviser to George Bush, broke the all-male stranglehold on interest-rate setting in the UK when she became a member of the committee last month. Markets are looking more stable this morning after yesterday\u2019s rout. FTSE 100 down 0.2%, 15 points at 6621 Germany DAX down 0.5% France CAC 40 down 0.25% Spain IBEX down 0.8% Italy FTSE MIB down 0.14% Christian Schulz at Berenberg bank says Putin, not inflation, is the real issue at today\u2019s ECB meeting. Another major escalation of the troubles in eastern Ukraine could spread the negative confidence effect from core European exporters to the wider economy. If Russian tanks roll westwards into Ukraine, the so-far shielded consumer confidence could take a hit even in far-away Iberia. The ECB will stand ready to act decisively in such circumstances, even deploying quantitative easing as a last resort. So far, however, Putin\u2019s impact on the Eurozone has been mild. The ECB, which has in the past cancelled its August meeting, is not expected to make any major announcements today. But economists are intrigued to hear what ECB president Mario Draghi has to say about last week\u2019s dreadful inflation data. Robert Kuenzel of Daiwa Capital Markets says: Draghi certainly has some explaining to do why euro area inflation saw yet another dip in July to a new 4\u00bd-year low of 0.4%. While the technical answer is known (base effects from energy prices), the ECB\u2019s repeated overestimating of the inflation path this year may be starting to harm its credibility. But it is far too soon for the ECB to even consider a policy change, given that the latest flagship initiative TLTROs only starts next month. So the Governing Council will stick to their guns and simply hope for the best. In the UK, insurance groups Aviva and RSA have posted upbeat results, amid efforts to turn their businesses around. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports: Britain\u2019s largest general insurer Aviva made an operating profit of \u00a31.1bn in the first six months of the year, up 4%. Overall new business climbed 9% to \u00a3453m, although the company reported a 41% reduction in the value of new business from annuities in the UK following the sweeping pension reforms announced in the March Budget. The chancellor scrapped rules that force pensioners to buy an annuity. \u201cWe suspect there are further falls to come,\u201d said Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital. Aviva boss Mark Wilson said: \u201cAviva remains a work in progress, and these results are a step in the right direction.\u201d The company reduced debt and made more cost savings. Under Stephen Hester, the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss, rival RSA moved back into the black in the first half with a \u00a369m pretax profit, against a \u00a3250m loss a year ago. Hester plans to resume dividend payments at the full year after scrapping payouts in February. Hester took the helm in February after Simon Lee quit in December in the wake of three profit warnings and an accounting scandal in Ireland. Hester took immediate action, tapping shareholders for cash in a \u00a3775m rights issue while also raising over \u00a3600m from selling assets in eastern Europe, Canada and China. Hester said: \u201cRSA\u2019s action plan is going well. Since announcing it five months ago, we have made strong progress improving strategic focus and capital health.\u201d He added: \u201cWhile first half profits are modest, they reflect further balance sheet and reserve clean-up as well as above normal weather costs.\u201d Several analysts described the RSA results as messy, however. There were further losses in Ireland and analysts at Citi were disappointed by RSA\u2019s underwriting profit of just \u00a32m. There\u2019s better corporate news out of Germany this morning. Commerzbank said net profit more than doubled in the second quarter, boosted by a stronger performance at its retail unit and lower overall loan-loss provisions. Germany\u2019s second biggest bank said it would speed up the clean up of unwanted assets to support the turnaround of the bank, which was bailed out of the financial crisis by the Germany government. Deutsche Telekom beat forecasts with its quarterly report \u2013 EBITDA excluding special items increased to \u20ac4.43bn, compared with forecasts of \u20ac4.35bn \u2013 after a rise in earnings in the US offset investments in its German networks. The weak German data (see below) suggest the eurozone\u2019s largest economy stagnated or possibly shrank in the second quarter, say economists. Carsten Brzeski of ING Bank blames the slowdown on domestic problems, rather than the crisis in Ukraine. Contrary to often voiced views that the German economy has suffered severely from the ongoing geopolitical tensions, the probable stagnation was rather home-made. Particularly, the construction sector has become a drag on growth. The expected downturn after the weather-driven boom in the first quarter has been worse than expected. He expects construction and private consumption, on the back of low interest rates, the strong labour market and higher wages, to drive growth in the second half of the year; but notes that geopolitical tensions and a bumpy recovery in the rest of the eurozone could hit exports. The domestic fundamentals of the German economy remain sound and with the expected growth acceleration in the US and the UK at least some major trade partners could keep the German export engine running. However, recent data was a strong reminder that islands of happiness only exist in books and not in economic reality. This morning, we\u2019ve already had weak data out of Germany, fuelling fears that the industrial recovery in the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy is running out of steam. Industrial output rose just 0.3% from May. While that is the first increase in four months, economists were targeting a rise of 1.3%. Bloomberg reports: The European Union agreed last week on its widest-ranging sanctions yet over Russia\u2019s backing of rebels in eastern Ukraine and the Bundesbank has cited geopolitical tensions as contributing to a probable stagnation of the economy in the second quarter. Factory orders fell the most in more than 2 1/2 years in June and sentiment surveys have plunged in Germany, Russia\u2019s biggest trading partner in Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to say that tensions with Russia are already weighing on hard data,\u201d said Andreas Rees, chief German economist at UniCredit MIB in Frankfurt. \u201cBut psychological headwinds are increasing and we have to see whether this pessimism will become persistent.\u201d German industrial output Over night, it emerged that Bank of America may have agreed to pay what would be the largest settlement with the US justice department as a result of the financial crisis. AP reports: Bank of America has tentatively agreed to pay between $16bn and $17bn to settle an investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis, a source directly familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The deal with the bank, which must still be finalised, would be the largest Justice Department settlement by far arising from the economic meltdown. It follows earlier multibillion-dollar agreements reached in the last year with Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal had not yet been announced, cautioned that some details still needed to be worked out and that it was possible the agreement could fall apart. The European Central Bank holds its monthly press conference today against the backdrop of a worsening economic climate in the eurozone and rising tensions with Russia. ECB president Mario Draghi is not expected to announce any change in policy, given that the new stimulus announced last month has not even started yet. But, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets, notes: Markets will be paying close attention to the press conference and in particular the ECB President\u2019s views on what negative effects the situation in Ukraine is likely to have on the ECB\u2019s economic forecasts for the euro area. The Bank of England will also announce its policy decision later. There\u2019s unlikely to be any change there but we may find out that some members of the monetary policy committee are edging towards a rate rise when the minutes are released in two weeks time.",

Shares in the company fell 10% after it surprised markets with the news that the department of energy and climate change (Decc) had won its appeal against a high court judgment last month declaring Drax eligible for the state subsidy. Drax said it would not be appealing against the latest decision. In December, the company was told it could receive government funding under a new subsidy scheme for converting two of its coal-powered units into biomass-fuelled generators. The dispute arose in April, when ministers unexpectedly announced funding was being denied for one unit on the grounds it was ineligible for the scheme. The high court subsequently ruled in favour of Drax, saying the second unit was eligible for the so-called investment contract. But on Thursday the company said: \"Drax confirms that the court of appeal has reached a decision in relation to the appeal by the department of energy and climate change against the high court judgment that Drax's second unit conversion is eligible for an investment contract. \"The court of appeal has allowed Decc's appeal and dismissed Drax's application for judicial review. Accordingly, the second unit conversion is no longer eligible for an investment contract. Having taken legal advice, Drax will not appeal against this decision.\" The firm added it will now consider its options for the planned biomass conversion, which is still eligible for a lower subsidy under the renewables obligation scheme.

      "bodyText": "A senior executive at Standard Chartered bank has complained that bankers are being treated \"like criminals\" when money laundering rules are broken. \"Banks have been asked to play the role of policing anti-money laundering \u2026 [but when] we have a lapse we don't get treated like a policeman, we are treated like a criminal,\" Jaspal Bindra, who runs Standard Chartered's business in Asia, told Reuters. The bank, listed in London but with extensive operations in emerging markets, was fined $667m (\u00a3395m) two years ago for lapses in its systems which allowed it to move billions of pounds to countries such as Iran and breach sanctions. On Wednesday, it revealed that the monitor imposed as part of this fine had uncovered new issues \u2013 which it claimed were of a less significant nature \u2013 that would likely lead to another fine for potential money laundering offences. \"The issue is not so much about whether the US is wrong or right, you have fines in every country, every regulator has fines, but it's the level of fines that is quite difficult for banks,\" Bindra said. The bank said the remarks by Bindra reflected his personal views. Peter Sands, Standard Chartered chief executive, said on Wednesday when he was presenting the bank's results that he respected the views of regulators. \"We want to be clear that Jaspal's quote does not represent the bank's view on anti-money laundering or conduct regulation. As Peter said yesterday, Standard Chartered is fully committed to playing our role in supporting the regulatory conduct agenda and the fight against financial crime,\" the bank's spokesman said. Standard Chartered's chairman Sir John Peace had to apologise last year for describing the events that led to the 2012 fine as \"clerical errors\". One of the criticisms levelled since the crisis is that bankers have not been jailed for the errors that caused the financial crash. As a result, the British government is introducing a criminal offence for reckless behaviour when banks are collapsing. Bindra's remarks come in a week in which the pace of regulatory change and demands imposed by regulators across the world have become the subject of public debate. Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, on Monday used unusually strong language to warn of an \"observable and growing danger of disproportionate risk aversion\" among staff who were fearful of fines. HSBC was also fined \u00a31.2bn in 2012 for system failures that allowed the bank to launder money, including for Mexican drug cartels. Flint complained that there are only 52 weekends in a year for bankers to complete the necessary systems changes to comply with new rules. \"I do not think we have ever had to ask so much of so many,\" said Flint. \"The demands now being placed on the human capital of the firm and on our operational and systems capabilities are unprecedented.\" Among other of the new rules being imposed on bankers in Britain, are those which reverse the burden of proof and require them to prove their innocence. These have been questioned by the boss of Lloyds Banking Group, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio. He told Sky News: \"Enforcement and fines have an important role as a credible deterrent against future misconduct. But the new rules will potentially reverse the burden of proof where individuals are guilty until they prove themselves innocent in the eyes of the regulator. \"I worry that this could incentivise people to do nothing, as they could waste their time trying to create a paper trail rather than doing what they should be doing, focusing on customers,\" Horta-Os\u00f3rio said. Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury select committee of MPs, has called on bankers to demonstrate that the industry was becoming too risk averse.",

As Peter said yesterday, Standard Chartered is fully committed to playing our role in supporting the regulatory conduct agenda and the fight against financial crime,\" the bank's spokesman said.</p> <p>Standard Chartered's chairman Sir John Peace <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/21/standard-chartered-us-regulators-iran-sanctions\" title=\"\">had to apologise last year</a> for describing the events that led to the 2012 fine as \"clerical errors\".</p> <p>One of the criticisms levelled since the crisis is that bankers have not been jailed for the errors that caused the financial crash. As a result, the British government is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/30/regulators-want-bankers-to-accept-criminal-liability\" title=\"\">introducing a criminal offence for reckless behaviour when banks are collapsing</a>.</p> <p>Bindra's remarks come in a week in which the pace of regulatory change and demands imposed by regulators across the world have become the subject of public debate. Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, on Monday used unusually strong language to warn of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/04/hsbc-chairman-warns-against-ringfence-banks\" title=\"\">\"observable and growing danger of disproportionate risk aversion\" among staff</a> who were fearful of fines.</p> <p>HSBC was also<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-bank-us-money-laundering\" title=\"\"> fined \u00a31.2bn in 2012</a> for system failures that allowed the bank to launder money, including for Mexican drug cartels.</p> <p>Flint complained that there are only 52 weekends in a year for bankers to complete the necessary systems changes to comply with new rules.</p> <p>\"I do not think we have ever had to ask so much of so many,\" said Flint. \"The demands now being placed on the human capital of the firm and on our operational and systems capabilities are unprecedented.\"</p> <p>Among other of the new rules being imposed on bankers in Britain, are those which reverse the burden of proof and require them to prove their innocence. These have been questioned by the boss of Lloyds Banking Group, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio. <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/1314022/lloyds-boss-joins-ranks-warning-on-new-rules\" title=\"\">He told Sky News</a>: \"Enforcement and fines have an important role as a credible deterrent against future misconduct. But the new rules will potentially reverse the burden of proof where individuals are guilty until they prove themselves innocent in the eyes of the regulator.</p> <p>\"I worry that this could incentivise people to do nothing, as they could waste their time trying to create a paper trail rather than doing what they should be doing, focusing on customers,\" Horta-Os\u00f3rio said.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury select committee of MPs, has called on bankers to demonstrate that the industry was becoming too risk averse.</p>",

Since the global financial crisis, Australians as a whole have been saving more than 10% of our national disposable income: But the report found that only 46% of households reported the ability to save each month, the lowest level since ME Bank\u2019s first survey in October 2011. And of those who were saving, the amount fell 12% over six months. The report also found that 35% of households \u201chad less than $1000 in cash-on-hand\u201d, which was a rise of 7% over six months. And finally, \u201c24% said they could not raise $3000 in an emergency, a rise of 6%\u201d. The drop in financial comfort experienced by households is also reflected in the retail trade figures released this week by the ABS. While there was a surprising increase in the seasonally adjusted 0.6% monthly growth, the less erratic trend figures show a strong decline in growth of retail trade since December. The pattern of declining monthly growth over the past six months has not been replicated in the past five years. Apart from 2012-13, monthly growth in June has been stronger than it was in December of the past five years. And even in 2012-13 June saw a pick-up in spending compared to May, suggesting the budget last year had not kept spenders away from the shops in the manner it has this year. For now it seems households are yet to be convinced the government is headed the right way. For all the talk about tough decisions being made to solve long-term problem, the ME Report found only \u201c41% of Australians believe the 2014-15 federal budget will lead to long-term gains for all Australians\u201d. Just as retailers are finding it tough going, after a three-month sales pitch the treasurer, Joe Hockey, is still struggling to find willing buyers for what he is selling.",
