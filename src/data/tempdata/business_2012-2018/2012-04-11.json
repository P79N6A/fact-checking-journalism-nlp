The ADB warns that this growing gap between rich and poor will eventually start to jeopardise growth, as disadvantaged groups demand political redress and poor workers are left on the sidelines of the economy. The report urges governments to tackle inequality in three ways: by aiming to create \"productive jobs for a wide section of the population;\" by improving social inclusion so that access to education, health and other services is not restricted to the rich; and by creating social safety nets to protect the poorest in society.

The troubled retailer said it was reviewing its brand communications \u2013 one of the most coveted accounts in advertising \u2013 a decision that could end its relationship with The Red Brick Road, the agency behind the longrunning \"Tesco family\" campaign, which features the actors Fay Ripley and Mark Addy. The shakeup is the latest fallout from the retailer's first profit warning in 20 years in January, which was blamed on weak Christmas sales and the failure of its Big Price Drop marketing push to win over customers. Last month Tesco's boss, Philip Clarke, took charge of the day-to-day running of its UK stores, which led to the departure of its respected UK head Richard Brasher. The company's investors are restive because the group's success hinges on the UK chain, which generates two-thirds of Tesco's near \u00a368bn annual sales and \u00a33.7bn profits. Until recently Tesco could do no wrong in the eyes of its shareholders thanks to its consistently strong performance, but the profit alert changed all that. At the weekend Richard Black, a fund manager at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, Tesco's third-largest shareholder with a 4% stake, said Tesco \"needs to think long and hard about what it wants to be\". Clarke said taking charge of the UK business would give him \"greater focus\" to oversee improvements in stores, insisting \"very strong plans for improvement\" were beginning to show progress. Clarke, who succeeded the long-serving Sir Terry Leahy last year, is due to update the City with the company's full-year results on Wednesday. He is expected to put the brakes on opening big out-of-town stores and to spend hundreds of millions of pounds revamping existing shop outlets and improving its website. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said Clarke's priority must be to stabilise the performance of the UK chain. \"Tesco UK needs to be interesting and fun, which leaves no place for arrogance and corporate deafness.\" Tesco is one of the country's biggest advertisers, with a media spend of \u00a3140m in the 12 months to the end of February, according to Nielsen, the information and insights firm.

      "bodyText": "It is there in black and white for any one who takes the time to read the terms under which Bob Diamond was appointed chief executive of Barclays bank. Dated January 2011, when he took on the top job after more than a decade running the investment bank, the employment terms read: \"Barclays will consult with you in good faith and give consideration as to whether and in which ways Barclays can hold you harmless against any incremental tax liability incurred as a result of your return to the UK to perform your assignment\". By way of the background, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in October 2008, when Barclays bought the Wall Street operations of the defunct firm, Diamond went back to his native America to oversee the crucial integration. Barely 12 months later, he was promoted to the top job that required him to come back to his adopted home in the UK (he has British citizenship). While the potential of holding him \"harmless against incremental tax liability\" is spelt out, the size of the bill - \u00a35.7m - has proved to be shocking. As is the admission by Barclays that there is likely to be another payment in 2012, albeit a \"significantly reduced\" one. The Barclays annual report describes the \u00a35.7m it has paid to the exchequer as \"tax equalisation\" because of the differing tax treatment between capital gains on historic share awards in the US and the UK which could not be offset by a double taxation treaty between the two countries. As has been previously reported, Diamond is employed by Gracechurch Services Corporation, a subsidiary of the bank, and has an \"assignment agreement\" with Barclays that spells out the terms of him becoming chief executive. While this appears overly complicated, Barclays insists that it employs a number of its bankers this way to allow them to keep continuity of US benefits, particularly for healthcare. Is that unusual? His counterpart at HSBC, Stuart Gulliver, is seconded to work for HSBC Holdings - the overall opeartion - through a Dutch-based HSBC Asia Holdings, again intended to give global bankers continuity in their benefits and pensions. Shareholders have a fortnight to decide whether the tax bill was a price worth paying to bring Diamond back to the UK. One of the largest shareholders is Blackrock, the fund manager to which Barclays Global Investors was sold and on which Diamond has a seat on the board. How might it vote with its 7% stake? The decision, it seems, will be taken by an independent fiduciary to avoid potential conflicts. The shareholders who are now considering whether to vote against the Barclays remuneration report at the annual meeting might want to ask themselves whether they should have sought more clarity on that pledge by Barclays to make Diamond \"harmless\" to any tax inequalities. Equally the board of Barclays might need to explain why it needed to offer Diamond such a clause in his employment to promote him to a role he clearly wanted.

But the Asian Development Bank, which works to reduce poverty in the region, warned today that rising inequality could soon undermine the very basis of these countries' economic success. The ADB's intervention is one contribution to an increasingly lively global argument that narrowing the gap between rich and poor is not just a social or political imperative, it is an economic necessity. That's true for two reasons. First, an ever-growing gap between rich and poor is likely to have explosive political consequences, particularly when the poor in question are living on the breadline. China's latest five-year plan, which aims at a slower but more equitable economic growth, is an acknowledgement that Beijing must address the concerns of millions of disenfranchised and frustrated rural poor, or face the potential for rising unrest. Or as the ADB puts it, in a rather more circumspect way, if Asian governments fail to make growth fairer, they may be, \"pulled into inefficient populist policies, which will benefit neither growth nor equity\". But secondly, as Stewart Lansley argued in a recent book, concentrating resources in the hands of a wealthy few is a bad strategy for achieving economic growth. The rich tend to save their cash, or tie it up in unproductive assets such as yachts; whereas the poor spend every penny they get, boosting consumer demand and generating more jobs along the way. Having a large proportion of the adult population uneducated and lying idle, or trapped in rural backwaters far from the economic action, is not just socially unjust, it's economically mad. The west has learned the hard way in the past five years that unleashing a super-rich elite and hoping they'll drag the rest of the economy behind them doesn't work. As they continue to develop, the Asian nations have the chance to show there's a better way.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned that the \"scramble\" for a diminishing pool of safe assets poses a fresh risk to global financial stability. With demand for rock-solid investments on the increase, the Washington-based IMF said a lack of supply could lead to \"more short-term volatility jumps, herding behaviour and runs on sovereign debt\". The Fund predicted that the drop in the number of countries whose sovereign debt was considered safe could remove $9tn (\u00a35.6tn) from the supply of safe assets by 2016, roughly 16% of the total. \"Safe-asset demand is expanding at the same time that the universe of what is considered safe is shrinking,\" it said. It was critical of the credit agencies for their willingness to provide the top AAA rating for US mortgage-backed securities and suggested governments should be wary about imposing over-tough financial regulations that would intensify the stampede for risk-free assets. \"The shrinking universe of safe assets and the upward-demand pressures have negative implications for global financial stability,\" the Fundit said in an article in its latest Global Financial Stability Report, released before next week's official publication. \"Safe-asset scarcity will increase the price of safety and compel investors to move down the safety scale as they scramble to obtain scarce assets.\" Policymakers could help to restore the balance between demand and supply by ensuring financial institutions do not have to acquire too rapidly safe assets to meet new tests for their soundness. \"Although regulatory reforms to make institutions safer are clearly needed, insufficient differentiation across eligible assets to satisfy some regulatory requirements could precipitate unintended cliff effects \u2013 sudden drops in the prices \u2013 when some safe assets become unsafe and no longer satisfy various regulatory criteria.\" In countries where there were concerns about the high levels of public debt, the Fund encouraged governments to get to grips with budget deficits. The IMFIt said demand for safe assets was increasing as a result of heightened uncertainty, regulatory reforms to make banks more financially secure and quantitative easing policies adopted by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The two central banks had become \"large holders of long-term government securities, with some risks for safe-asset markets\". The Fund added: \"The sizeable presence of central banks in the long-term government securities market may limit the room for further policy manoeuvre, and may constrain central bank flexibility in smoothly unwinding current monetary policies.\" Ever since the world's financial markets froze up in August 2007, the three big credit agencies \u2013 Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch \u2013 have been criticised for being too generous in the ratings given to sub-prime mortgage debt. The Fund said: \"The onset of the global financial crisis revealed considerable underpricing of safety linked to over-reliance on credit ratings, adverse incentives from prudential regulations and private-sector practices. The fact that even highly rated assets are not without risk was reaffirmed during the global financial crisis by losses on AAA-rated tranches of mortgage-backed securities and, more recently, by rating downgrades of sovereigns previously considered virtually riskless.\" It added: \"In retrospect, high credit ratings were applied too often, both for private and sovereign issuers, and they did not sufficiently differentiate across assets with different underlying qualities.\"",

The \"lack of verifiable performance metrics\" led it to recommend shareholders oppose the remuneration report at BP's AGM on Thursday.</p> <p>A BP spokesman said it did not recognise Pirc's analysis, adding: \"Remuneration of directors is closely aligned with both the long-term performance of the company and the interests of shareholders.\"</p> <p>Pay is not the only issue that will cause debate. A contingent of aggrieved Gulf business representatives and anti-tar-sand campaigners hope to raise difficult questions for the BP board.</p> <p>One of those Gulf representatives, Bryan Parras, from Houston, claims he was prevented from entering the BP AGM in 2011.</p> <p>He said: \"This year, I will be attempting to deliver an even stronger message to the board: 'You claim that the spill has been cleaned up. This isn't true.' Oil is still impacting our communities, causing sickness, and triggering a collapse in fish stocks and local livelihoods. Many face overwhelming medical bills from illnesses associated with the spill and cleanup.\"</p> <p>BP is still under attack despite spending more than $22bn (\u00a313bn) on the spill, including paying at least $6.6bn (\u00a34.1bn) in claims to individuals and businesses, about $1.4bn (\u00a30.9bn) in claims and advances to government entities, and around $14bn (\u00a38.8bn) for response efforts.</p> <p>A company spokesman said: \"BP's efforts to help restore the Gulf coast region have not only been significant, they are unprecedented.\"</p> <p>Among those who will not be at the ExCel centre is Sir William Castell. BP's senior independent director and chairman of the safety committee saw 43% of shareholders vote against his re-election at the same event 12 months ago.</p> <p>The City grandee, who is also chairman of the Wellcome Trust and on the board of General Electric, has decided to stand down as a BP non-executive and will not turn upon Thursday, his last day.</p> <p>Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP chairman, also saw 15% of shareholders vote against him last year.

A group of investors will vote in protest against acceptance of this part of the company's remuneration report, emboldened by a negative recommendation from the shareholder advisory body Pirc. BP is in the middle of a huge US court case over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 that is still keeping its share price below that of rivals such as Shell and ExxonMobil. Environmentalists and other representatives from the Gulf region are planning a noisy protest outside the ExCel building in London's Docklands but also hope to raise questions from the floor of the meeting. The financial liabilities from the spill continue to dog BP but profits have bounced back, allowing Dudley to be awarded a $6.8m (\u00a34.3m) payout including an \"on-target\" bonus of 150% of his basic $1.7m (\u00a31.1m) salary. At least 10% of the company's institutional shareholders are expected to follow the advice of Pirc, which sent out a research note arguing the bonus was \"difficult to justify\" given the lack of information about performance measures used. \"The remuneration structure has the potential to pay excessive variable remuneration and we note that [in 2011] this was the case,\" Pirc said. The \"lack of verifiable performance metrics\" led it to recommend shareholders oppose the remuneration report at BP's AGM on Thursday. A BP spokesman said it did not recognise Pirc's analysis, adding: \"Remuneration of directors is closely aligned with both the long-term performance of the company and the interests of shareholders.\" Pay is not the only issue that will cause debate. A contingent of aggrieved Gulf business representatives and anti-tar-sand campaigners hope to raise difficult questions for the BP board. One of those Gulf representatives, Bryan Parras, from Houston, claims he was prevented from entering the BP AGM in 2011. He said: \"This year, I will be attempting to deliver an even stronger message to the board: 'You claim that the spill has been cleaned up. This isn't true.' Oil is still impacting our communities, causing sickness, and triggering a collapse in fish stocks and local livelihoods. Many face overwhelming medical bills from illnesses associated with the spill and cleanup.\" BP is still under attack despite spending more than $22bn (\u00a313bn) on the spill, including paying at least $6.6bn (\u00a34.1bn) in claims to individuals and businesses, about $1.4bn (\u00a30.9bn) in claims and advances to government entities, and around $14bn (\u00a38.8bn) for response efforts. A company spokesman said: \"BP's efforts to help restore the Gulf coast region have not only been significant, they are unprecedented.\" Among those who will not be at the ExCel centre is Sir William Castell. BP's senior independent director and chairman of the safety committee saw 43% of shareholders vote against his re-election at the same event 12 months ago. The City grandee, who is also chairman of the Wellcome Trust and on the board of General Electric, has decided to stand down as a BP non-executive and will not turn upon Thursday, his last day. Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP chairman, also saw 15% of shareholders vote against him last year. But he has managed to retain the confidence of the majority of investors despite a very low profile in the immediate aftermath of the Macondo blowout, which claimed the lives of 11 oil workers.",
