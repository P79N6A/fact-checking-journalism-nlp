    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It all started when stock markets around the world tumbled in October 1987. After seeing the Dow Jones index fall by more than 500 points in a single day, the-then chairman of the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to shore up the stock market. It did the trick. Confidence returned, Wall Street rallied and so was born the idea of the \"Greenspan put\" \u2013 when times got tough the Fed could always be relied upon to ride to the rescue. The Greenspan put was deployed in a more serious crisis in 1998, when the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management went belly-up, a move that ensured that the wild dotcom boom of the late 1990s continued for a further two years. When the internet bubble collapsed under the weight of absurd valuations and falling profitability, Wall Street expected Greenspan to deliver, and once again he did not disappoint. Interest rates were slashed to 1% and left there for a year, creating the conditions for a housing boom the like of which the United States had never seen. Eventually, the Fed did start to tighten policy, but too little too late. Greenspan has long retired, but the Fed's policy has not changed. The biggest bubble in history led to the biggest bust in history and the biggest policy response in history. Zero interest rates, electronic money creation, manipulation of the money markets: you name it, the Fed under Greenspan's successor, Ben Bernanke, has tried it. The strategy appears to be working, after a fashion. Activity in the world's biggest economy is picking up and unemployment has started to come down. Compared with Europe \u2013 which is not saying much, admittedly \u2013 the US is doing OK. In the financial markets, there is growing confidence that America's recovery is for real, and a lively debate about whether the Fed needs to start to thinking about withdrawing some of the stimulus it has provided. Bond yields \u2013 the interest rate paid on government bonds \u2013 have been rising in the past few weeks, an indication that financial markets believe stronger growth will force the Fed into taking pre-emptive action against inflation. There are three schools of thought about the US economy. In the first there are the doves, who believe that policy should be kept ultra-loose for years to come. They are led by Bernanke, who, as a student of the Great Depression and Japan's \"lost decade\" in the 1990s, is alive to the risk that tightening too quickly and too aggressively can tip countries back into recession. That was what happened in the US in 1937 and on many occasions in Japan during the 1990s and early 2000s. As things stand, Bernanke would be happy to see the Fed's key policy rate remain at virtually zero for the next 2\u00bd years. The Fed chairman is modestly encouraged by recent developments in the US economy, which has seen jobs created, a floor put under the housing market and a pickup in factory output. But he remains unconvinced about the strength and the durability of this recovery, not least because something similar happened at the end of 2010 and the start of 2011. There remains a lot of slack in the US labour market. In the past five years participation rates have fallen, the number of discouraged workers has increased, and under-employment - those working part-time but want to work full time \u2013 stands at 15%. For the time being, Bernanke commands a majority on the Fed's open market committee that sets policy. But a smaller faction \u2013 the hawks \u2013 believes the recovery is for real and that the Fed will regret its laid-back approach if inflation lets rip over the next few years. This group says it is worried about repeating Greenspan's mistakes. A paper being presented to the UK Royal Economic Society annual conference this week argues that this policy error \u2013 mirrored elsewhere in the west \u2013 caused the global financial crisis, since it resulted in a search for investments that paid higher interest. This, in turn, led banks to soften the requirements for borrowers, the upshot of which was the sub-prime mortgage boom. The study by Manthos Delis and his colleagues at the Cass Business School at City University concludes: \"Our results are all the more striking as the present stance of the Federal Reserve is to maintain ultra-low interest rates in an attempt to resurrect the sagging US economy. Central banks should consider the possible adverse effects of their loose monetary policies on bank risk-taking.\" The doves and the hawks are also slugging it out over the US budget deficit. Doves want to delay action to repair America's public finances; indeed some, like Paul Krugman, say that Barack Obama's economic and political problems stem from his failure to provide a big enough stimulus. Hawks, like all the Republican candidates for the White House, say that too much government spending is \"crowding out\" the private sector, thus stifling recovery. Where a dove like Bernanke would agree with a hawk like Mitt Romney is that the US can return to its former economic glory provided the right policies are used. This rests on a number of assumptions: that America remains a powerful economy, that it is a world leader in a number of sectors, and that it has a history of re-inventing itself, thereby confounding those who write it off. All of that is true. Yet there is a third way of looking at the US economy. Yes, it has bounced back from difficult periods, but the picture over the last few decades is that a bigger and bigger stimulus is required to produce a growth spurt. What's more, the upswings have been weaker than in the 25 years after the second world war, and have been accompanied by larger trade deficits and the relentless hollowing out of manufacturing. In his new book*, Thomas Palley notes that there has been a marked difference in the growth paradigms before and after 1980. Prior to that date, when the economy grew so did the incomes of the American middle class. Everybody gained from productivity improvements, and in the good times manufacturing employment rose and the trade deficit was negligible. After 1980, the gains from productivity were monopolised by those at the top, manufacturing employment fell even during upswings, while the boom of 2001-07 was the weakest in postwar history. Palley notes that the post-1980 growth paradigm \"involved squeezing worker incomes, squeezing household saving rates, raising debt levels, persistent asset price inflation in excess of consumer price inflation, and reliance on ever lower nominal (ie not adjusted for inflation) interest rates\". This is a sobering but accurate conclusion. For a while America's weaknesses were masked by asset price bubbles, cheap imports, financial innovation, and cheap money. But there are limits to how high debt levels can go and how low interest rates can go. The desperate attempts by the Fed to kick-start the economy show that these limits have been reached. In that sense, the debate between the doves and the hawks is irrelevant. A more interesting debate is whether America's growth model is a turkey. *Thomas Palley: From Financial Crisis to Stagnation, Cambridge University Press",

      "bodyText": "It may only be March, but the granite town hall in Aberdeen is shining in the spring sunshine like a fairy castle. The council has just moved into this newly sandblasted historic building as part of a wider city facelift that will see a local grandee spending \u00a350m to spruce up central gardens and a new \"Merchant Quarter\" bring boutique hotels to an area better known for its seedy pubs. All Britain's oil capital needed was for some modern Merlin to come along and sprinkle financial fairy dust on the business sector to get the city moving, and he arrived in the guise of chancellor of the exchequer. George Osborne unveiled a series of tax breaks and other incentives for the oil industry last week that could create a new mini-boom. And it was just in time. The global crude price might be riding high but the operators and contractors who bring commercial life to the Silver City were feeling decidedly low. North Sea crude and gas production fell 17% in 2011, one of its biggest ever annual drops, while the number of exploration wells drilled was down by half on 2010. The UK offshore industry had been reeling from a windfall tax imposed by the chancellor in the budget this time last year. Even some petroleum executives were joking about the North Sea as the \"Dead Sea\", while other energy professionals believed it was time the UK concentrated on wind and nuclear. But it is all smiles in the north-east of Scotland now, typified by an enormous grin on the face of the 6ft 7in Dutchman who runs Aberdeen-based Taqa Bratani. Leo Koot, the managing director at this outpost of the Abu Dhabi state oil group, admits he had been depressed about where the local offshore industry had been heading. \"When my parent company starts making references to Britain's [high] tax regime, that is not good. I had a lot of explaining to do. Obviously the biggest risk would be for [our] growth vision for the North Sea to be curtailed,\" he says. And Taqa is just the kind of business that Osborne needs to keep sweet if he is to put the brakes on the precipitous level of decline in the domestic oil and gas industry, which not only makes Britain more reliant on foreign imports but also reduces Treasury tax take. The Gulf-state company has brought its petrodollars to the region partly to pick up the latest technological know-how on exploration and production, but also because it sees the North Sea as a welcome diversification. Taqa has similar overseas operations in Canada and has gradually secured a host of UK fields such as North Cormorant and Tern as well as the Brent system of pipelines. Koot is unwilling to spell it out, but it seems clear that his company will now be in the market to buy up more assets no longer wanted by Shell, ExxonMobil and other western oil majors in the North Sea. These potential sellers, who played a big role building up the UK oil province in the early days, are more interested in chasing the big \"elephant\" discoveries still available in emerging regions such as Angola, Brazil and Mozambique. They are gradually selling off their less-productive North Sea platforms and pipelines to those with a narrower focus. Smaller firms such as Taqa, Talisman Energy of Canada and America's Apache are the new buyers. They have demonstrated that they can come in to mature basins and squeeze out ever more oil. Since 2008, Taqa has taken over a portfolio of fields producing 25,000 barrels of oil a day at the time they were acquired. Now it is producing double that amount by smart use of new technology and targeted investment. Last year alone, it spent nearly $500m (\u00a3315m) upgrading and expanding its equipment. Koot now says \"billions\" in new investment could be unleashed by the fiscal changes introduced by the chancellor. And Malcolm Webb, director general of the industry lobby group Oil &amp; Gas UK, believes it could lead to \u00a340bn of new spending. He describes the government's new tax changes as a \"turning point\", underlining his belief that the Treasury has now come to accept the industry's constant refrain that it needs fiscal stability. Although the \u00a33bn worth of tax breaks for exploring the deep waters west of Shetland and better treatment for smaller fields were welcomed, perhaps the most significant change was Osborne's promise to provide contractual certainty over the decommissioning of old platforms. Peter Buchanan, chief executive of Valiant Petroleum, says this has been a problem for many years, and has made it much more difficult for the oil majors to sell off old fields to the smaller, nimbler newcomers. Most industry experts now accept that new reserves are going to be brought on stream not so much by building new platforms \u2013 although Taqa does not rule that out \u2013 but by incremental reservoirs being \"tied back\", or connected up, to existing platform and pipeline infrastructure. However, BP is bucking that received wisdom: it was given permission to drill brand new wells in the deep Atlantic off Shetland on Friday. BP has increased its North Sea spending by 50% in recent years to \u00a31.5bn annually as it presses ahead with development of projects in this region, such as Clair Ridge. Total, the large French oil group, is also spending large amounts of cash on the Laggan and Tormore fields, also west of Shetland. \"We know there are large discoveries to be made there,\" explains a BP spokesman in Aberdeen, who explains how oil can be brought up via floating production systems and loaded onto tankers out at sea. Environmentalists are not happy about oil companies \u2013 particularly BP \u2013 drilling in the pristine waters of the far north. They refer to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico as an example of what can go wrong. And they note that in recent weeks Chevron has faced a $11bn claim from prosecutors in Brazil for a spill there. Green groups, which say digging more oil out of the ground only slows any move towards a low-carbon economy, are not the only critics of the oil industry. Jake Molloy, a 17-year veteran of North Sea platforms himself and now a trade union organiser for the RMT based in Aberdeen, is also wary. He supports tax breaks to encourage oil companies to squeeze out the last drop of crude, and he goes further, saying he would like governments to stop tinkering endlessly with the fiscal regime and commit themselves over the life of the parliament not to make further changes. But he tempers this upbeat message with frustration at what he sees as employers in the industry \u2013 oil companies and contractors \u2013 outsourcing their staffing and diluting employment protections. This is typified, in his view, by the decision by Wood Group, a big commercial success story and a contractor for Taqa, to transfer employment contracts to a sister company based in Guernsey. Wood claims it needs to do this to remain competitive; meanwhile its chairman, Sir Ian Wood, is the man offering the \u00a350m to renovate Aberdeen's municipal gardens. Molloy says tartly: \"It is not quite Camelot in Aberdeen yet.\"",

      "bodyText": "\"It's Scotland's oil\" is one of the most highly charged slogans in Scottish politics. First used by the Scottish National Party in 1974, the notion that Scotland \"owns\" up to 90% of the North Sea's reserves remains one of the strongest sources of grievance for nationalists. And in the next two years, as Alex Salmond leads the country into a referendum on independence, it is likely to become one of the central arguments for nationalists: they believe it will help decide the fate of the UK. Ever since it became clear that North Sea oil fields would generate immense riches, the SNP has insisted that that wealth has been squandered by successive governments at Westminster. They point out that Norway, a country with a similar population to Scotland at just under 5 million, has saved much of its oil income: surplus revenue is ploughed into the government pension fund, which is now Europe's largest owner of shares and is worth about 3.3 trillion kroner (\u00a3360bn). The SNP argues that if you extend a line east from where the Scotland-England border hits the coast north of Berwick, the division of the seabed would give Scotland control over nearly all North Sea oil and gas fields. The Scottish government, which is drawing up a detailed case to support that 90% claim as its civil servants prepare for the referendum, asserts the North Sea will generate about \u00a354bn in revenues over the next five years, while its \"asset base\" is valued at roughly \u00a31tn, including remaining reserves. Salmond claims that, combined with Scotland's significant offshore wind and marine energy resources, and other industries such as whisky, this would make Scotland the OECD's sixth wealthiest nation, leaving the rest of the UK trailing in 15th place. But Salmond will have to answer anxieties about whether Scotland can offer the industry the same international muscle and relatively stable tax and regulatory regime the UK provides. Experts believe the oil companies and the engineering firms that rely heavily on North Sea contracts will be weighing up the potential negatives of independence. They would have to juggle two regulatory and tax regimes: the UK has expert health and safety and environmental agencies, largely controlled from Whitehall. Scotland would have to build its own from scratch. Would an independent Scotland, notionally one of the smallest of the EU member states, be able to match the UK's political influence and power in Brussels or on a global stage? There also remains the problem of the long-term oil exploration and drilling licences the UK government has issued to oil firms: many last for 30 years. How would those be transferred? Think too of how Scotland might defend North Sea rigs: would an Edinburgh government be able to afford to maintain a navy capable of tackling a terrorist incident? But the oil industry may also decide that Scottish governments would be more amenable on taxation: North Sea oil wealth is of far greater significance to the Scottish economy than it is to the UK's. While the figures fluctuate year by year, oil and gas generates about 2% of the UK's GDP and tax, but the Scottish government's annual economic report estimates it would make up 12% of Scotland's overall revenues. These delicate questions explain why UK ministers are being very polite to the Scottish government. Charles Hendry, the UK energy minister, said his government had not begun to look at the territorial claim. \"We haven't even got into those discussions; at this stage that issue may never arise,\" he says. \"The nature of what we'll be arguing in the runup to the referendum is that it's best to keep the structure we've got; that it's the best way of getting investment coming into Scotland; the best way of keeping people's electricity bills down in Scotland and therefore that we have the right policy in place. \"Our view at the moment is that this is a UK-wide industry, people have invested based on an assumption of that,\" he said. \"We believe that is the best way forward, we have not got into detailed discussions and negotiations about how independence would affect that because the referendum hasn't even been established and we've got all of those issues to go through. \"But what we do think is that when people look at the broader issues \u2013 and I think energy is a very important part of that process \u2013 then the attractiveness of the UK overall and in Scotland is enhanced by being part of the United Kingdom; the security of supply is enhanced by looking at it on a broader UK-wide basis; we're more able to move to a low-carbon, sustainable and affordable UK energy policy if we do it on a broader basis.\" Hendry argues that the difficulties of operating two different taxation and regulatory regimes in what is essentially the same region \u2013 the North Sea \u2013 will be for the Scottish government to set out. So far it has failed to do so. \"Primarily I think it's the Scottish government which needs to explain how those difficulties can be overcome. And we don't have their sense of how best this can be handled at this stage,\" he said. Asked how the UK government would deal with the huge political weight attached to North Sea oil by nationalists, Hendry also implies that the question has been superseded by the far more complex issue of producing and supplying energy as a whole, including renewables and nuclear power, in the UK and western Europe. Oil ownership is just part of a larger picture, to do with energy security and the energy market. Salmond has set the renewables industry a target of being able to supply 100% of Scotland's electricity demand by 2020 when conditions are favourable, while maintaining a back-up of two nuclear stations and existing coal-fired plants. But Hendry points to problems: if Scotland is independent by 2014, it will not have UK subsidies for renewables to draw on; it will have to pay for the grid infrastructure to export and import power; and at the same time be competing against French, Irish and Norwegian suppliers. A spokesman for John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, said: \"Scotland has a \u00a31tn North Sea asset base \u2013 at the same time as the UK's national debt has broken through \u00a31tn for the first time \u2013 with some 40% of reserves remaining and over half of the value still to be extracted. With the oil price forecast to rise over $200 a barrel, these figures absolutely underline the need for Scotland to gain control over our own resources with independence, for the long-term benefit of the country.\"",

      "bodyText": "The security guard's mirrored sunglasses reflect Barcelona's pale winter sunshine. His job is to keep the crowds attending the sprawling trade fair at bay. Behind him, a pavilion the size of a bus garage houses the latest technology produced by China's Huawei. Those without a meeting to attend are told they cannot enter, and cameras are banned inside. Huawei is China's biggest exporter, and its equipment helps run the BT broadband network, but the brand is unknown to most UK households. Regarded as a secretive organisation even within the people's republic, Huawei is headed by a former Red Army engineer, Ren Zhengfei. Unlike other Chinese IT firms, such as the PC maker Lenovo and telecoms group ZTE, Huawei is not listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. A private company owned entirely by its founders and employees, the names of its board members were only published for the first time last year. But it is also a flagbearer for China's \"going out\" policy of encouraging the first generation of corporations created by economic liberalisation in the 1980s to compete on the world stage. Entrepreneurial and unbureaucratic, it has prospered without having the state as a shareholder. It sells everything from mobile mast radios to software, data-centres and laptop dongles. Founded in 1987, Huawei only began exporting in earnest in 2000, but already over 65% of its revenues are from abroad. Last year, they totalled 185.2bn yuan (\u00a318.51bn), just half a billion pounds less than the world's largest telecoms equipment group, Ericsson. Now Huawei is preparing to step out of the shadows. While its governance remains veiled, the company is pushing its brand to the fore. It wants to place its products in the hands of millions of western consumers, and become the fourth largest manufacturer of smartphones by the end of this year. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, Huawei's devices chairman Richard Yu said that by the end of 2012 he hoped to have sold 60m smartphones, up from 17m last year. Hitting that target would vault the firm into the big league, behind Apple, Samsung and Nokia, and ahead of BlackBerry maker RIM and Taiwan's HTC. To succeed, it will have to redefine what \"Made in China\" stands for. While Huawei's hometown of Shenzhen is the electronics workshop of the world, churning out iPhones for Apple and PCs for Dell, its produce usually bears the stamp of a foreign company. Aside from PC maker Lenovo, it is hard to name a Chinese brand known to European and American shoppers. \"Consumer perception is that a Chinese product is cheap and looks cheap because the quality is no good,\" says Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at research firm IDC. \"Huawei needs to change that perception.\" Jeronimo believes Huawei products have the quality to compete, but says it will need to raise its public profile. The charge will be led from the UK, where no expense has been spared in recruiting British executives and an advisory board to help find friends in high places. Former Sunday Telegraph editor Patience Wheatcroft is an adviser, as is Amazon's ex-UK boss Brian McBride, and Sir Andrew Cahn, once chief of staff for Neil Kinnock and recently chief executive of UK Trade &amp; Investment, the government trade promotion body. To promote the smartphones, Bartle Bogle Hegarty, ad agency to Google and BA, will create a global campaign from London. \"It's imperative we are seen as a global brand and not a Chinese brand,\" says Mark Mitchinson, a Samsung veteran running Huawei's UK devices arm. His newest stock are phones and tablet computers running Google's Android interface, which house computer chips that have four rather than the now usual two processors, allowing them to handle multiple instructions at the same time. They are fast, particularly when it comes to downloading video. While most phone makers prefer to leave chips to specialists like Intel, Huawei, whose name stands for \"China can\" and \"splendid act\", designed its quad core processors in house and has become known in recent years for innovating. Some 62,000 of its 140,000 staff work in research and development, and there are 23 R&amp;D centres around the world. Without a recognised brand, Huawei's phones will sell on price. Its mission will be to mop up those mobile subscribers who don't yet own a smartphone, rather than trying to poach Apple's customers. With BlackBerry caught napping and now adjusting to a new chief executive, and Nokia yet to prove its adoption of Microsoft's Windows Phone interface can turn business around, Huawei is seizing a window of its own. \"There are certain manufacturers that have dropped the ball over recent years and others can pick up that ball and run with it,\" says Mitchinson. Samsung has shown it can be done. The Korean company moved from fifth to second spot globally in smartphone sales last year, the only one in the top five to grow in the face of the unstoppable iPhone. There are those who wonder why Huawei is so keen to risk its hard-earned yuans by chasing capricious mobile phone customers. The answer is that this is a high-growth market. Even in an early adopter nation like the UK, only half of us have a smartphone. And the handset market has the attraction of being a less politically sensitive one than infrastructure. Huawei is already big in Europe, having last year won a breakthrough contract to overhaul the network of the UK's largest operator, Everything Everywhere. But an offer to donate \u00a350m of equipment to bring a mobile signal into the London Underground in time for the Olympics was never taken up. MP Patrick Mercer described the possibility of detonating bombs with phones on trains as \"the answer to terrorists' prayers\". A spokesman for Huawei says the deal fell apart not because of security fears, but because commercial agreement could not be reached between all the various players involved. The culture within Huawei is often described as militaristic. Information is shared on a need-to know basis, with one employee complaining anonymously on recruitment website Glassdoor: \"Don't expect to get the information or documentation to be able to carry out the job you are employed to do.\" Others who have worked there, like former UK mobile chief Jeremy Sheehan, says this comes from a desire to \"protect client confidentiality\". Bengt Nordstr\u00f6m, a strategic adviser to European mobile networks, says Huawei has succeeded because of its ability to learn fast. While Chinese employees even in the UK still put their heads down on their desk for a nap after lunch, managers study for MBAs, and are offered crash courses in Western culture. \"Ten years ago they were really only selling on low prices,\" says Nordstr\u00f6m. \"It was hard to find people that could speak English well enough to conduct a business discussion. But for every quotation they produced, their quality increased. Customer relations is an area where Ericsson is stronger than any other vendor but Huawei have learnt that game.\" Backed by a $30bn credit line from the China Development Bank, the pattern of Huawei's international expansion has followed its philosophy, borrowed from Chairman Mao, of encircling the cities by winning the countryside. Beginning in Africa and Russia, it has moved successfully west. Only America has blocked its advance. Efforts to expand have been repeatedly neutralised by Washington. Offers to acquire Motorola's wireless division and a broadband software group were quashed after the sellers were informed that regulatory approval would not be forthcoming. A contract to modernise mobile operator Sprint Nextel's network was kyboshed, and the US commerce department last autumn barred Huawei from an emergency services contract. A British executive whose company buys from Huawei says US politicians are using espionage as a scare tactic to protect domestic businesses from foreign competitors. \"You've got to remember the most protectionist country of the developed world is America. Rupert Murdoch had to become American to buy Fox. What the Americans are really trying to do is stop Huawei getting the business they know they could get if they opened up their equipment market to them.\" Huawei's stated ambition is to become as big as Cisco or IBM, with annual revenues of $100bn in 10 years. Nordstr\u00f6m says this is unlikely without conquering America: \"This is an industry where you need to be truly global to have a future.\" Observers say the most serious threat to Huawei's ambitions comes from within. As Ren approaches his 68th birthday in October, the company he founded is facing a succession crisis. In her letter published in last year's annual report, Huawei's charismatic chairwoman, Sun Yafang, thanked the staff for re-electing her, saying: \"I am sincerely grateful to our employees' trust and confidence in me.\" It was a short statement that masked an internal power struggle. While Ren, who does not give interviews, has been criticised in the Chinese press for a lack of transparency, Sun is increasingly being seen as Huawei's public face, a networker who was among corporate China's most senior representatives at Davos this year. But in October 2010, a report in Meiri Jingi Xinwen (Daily Economic News) suggested Sun had been offered 1bn yuan to leave Huawei so that Ren could prepare the ground for the appointment to the 13-member board of his son, Meng Ping, who is customer relationship management director and is said to have spent time in the US. The company denies this. Whatever the truth, Sun survived in a post she has held since 1999 and Meng did not join the board. But the Ren dynasty holds sway at Huawei; Ren's daughter Meng Wanzhou is chief financial officer. Meanwhile, Ren Shulu, the founder's younger brother, is a member of the five-strong supervisory board that oversees the directors. Both boards are elected every five years, by 51 staff representatives who are in turn elected by Huawei's 60,000 shareholding staff. Gary Liu, a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says Ren's determination to find a successor from within his family stems from 2000 when his then second-in-command, Li Yinan, left to start a rival company, Harbour. Ren fought and eventually bought Harbour, but the experience, says Liu, destroyed his trust in non-family members. Succession is not just an issue at Huawei. China's first generation of entrepreneurs at Lenovo and white goods maker Haier are also nearing retirement. \"These companies' futures hinge on how effectively the incumbents manage leadership transitions. Indeed, the choices the founder CEOs make may well reshape their companies as well as the Chinese economy,\" says Liu. Ren has resisted a stock exchange listing, but ownership could help shed light on the business and build trust. Huawei may have to open its own doors before America decides to do the same.",

And the handset market has the attraction of being a less politically sensitive one than infrastructure.</p> <p>Huawei is already big in Europe, having last year won a breakthrough contract to overhaul the network of the UK's largest operator, Everything Everywhere. But an offer to donate \u00a350m of equipment to bring a mobile signal into the London Underground in time for the Olympics was never taken up.</p> <p>MP Patrick Mercer described the possibility of detonating bombs with phones on trains as \"the answer to terrorists' prayers\". A spokesman for Huawei says the deal fell apart not because of security fears, but because commercial agreement could not be reached between all the various players involved.</p> <p>The culture within Huawei is often described as militaristic. Information is shared on a need-to know basis, with one employee complaining anonymously on recruitment website Glassdoor: \"Don't expect to get the information or documentation to be able to carry out the job you are employed to do.\" Others who have worked there, like former UK mobile chief Jeremy Sheehan, says this comes from a desire to \"protect client confidentiality\".</p> <p>Bengt Nordstr\u00f6m, a strategic adviser to European mobile networks, says Huawei has succeeded because of its ability to learn fast. While Chinese employees even in the UK still put their heads down on their desk for a nap after lunch, managers study for MBAs, and are offered crash courses in Western culture. \"Ten years ago they were really only selling on low prices,\" says Nordstr\u00f6m. \"It was hard to find people that could speak English well enough to conduct a business discussion. But for every quotation they produced, their quality increased. Customer relations is an area where Ericsson is stronger than any other vendor but Huawei have learnt that game.\"</p> <p>Backed by a $30bn credit line from the China Development Bank, the pattern of Huawei's international expansion has followed its philosophy, borrowed from Chairman Mao, of encircling the cities by winning the countryside.</p> <p>Beginning in Africa and Russia, it has moved successfully west. Only America has blocked its advance. Efforts to expand have been repeatedly neutralised by Washington. Offers to acquire Motorola's wireless division and a broadband software group were quashed after the sellers were informed that regulatory approval would not be forthcoming. A contract to modernise mobile operator Sprint Nextel's network was kyboshed, and the US commerce department last autumn barred Huawei from an emergency services contract. A British executive whose company buys from Huawei says US politicians are using espionage as a scare tactic to protect domestic businesses from foreign competitors.</p> <p>\"You've got to remember the most protectionist country of the developed world is America. Rupert Murdoch had to become American to buy Fox. What the Americans are really trying to do is stop Huawei getting the business they know they could get if they opened up their equipment market to them.\"</p> <p>Huawei's stated ambition is to become as big as Cisco or IBM, with annual revenues of $100bn in 10 years. Nordstr\u00f6m says this is unlikely without conquering America: \"This is an industry where you need to be truly global to have a future.\"</p> <p>Observers say the most serious threat to Huawei's ambitions comes from within. As Ren approaches his 68th birthday in October, the company he founded is facing a succession crisis.</p> <p>In her letter published in last year's annual report, Huawei's charismatic chairwoman, Sun Yafang, thanked the staff for re-electing her, saying: \"I am sincerely grateful to our employees' trust and confidence in me.\" It was a short statement that masked an internal power struggle. While Ren, who does not give interviews, has been criticised in the Chinese press for a lack of transparency, Sun is increasingly being seen as Huawei's public face, a networker who was among corporate China's most senior representatives at Davos this year.</p> <p>But in October 2010, a report in <em>Meiri Jingi Xinwen </em>(Daily Economic News) suggested Sun had been offered 1bn&#xa0;yuan to leave Huawei so that Ren could prepare the ground for the appointment to the 13-member board of his son, Meng Ping, who is customer relationship management director and is said to have spent time in the US. The company denies this. Whatever the truth, Sun survived in a post she has held since 1999 and Meng did not join the board.</p> <p>But the Ren dynasty holds sway at Huawei; Ren's daughter Meng Wanzhou is chief financial officer. Meanwhile, Ren Shulu, the founder's younger brother, is a member of the five-strong supervisory board that oversees the directors. Both boards are elected every five years, by 51 staff representatives who are in turn elected by Huawei's 60,000 shareholding staff.</p> <p>Gary Liu, a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says Ren's determination to find a successor from within his family stems from 2000 when his then second-in-command, Li Yinan, left to start a rival company, Harbour. Ren fought and eventually bought Harbour, but the experience, says Liu, destroyed his trust in non-family members.</p> <p>Succession is not just an issue at Huawei. China's first generation of entrepreneurs at Lenovo and white goods maker Haier are also nearing retirement. \"These companies' futures hinge on how effectively the incumbents manage leadership transitions. Indeed, the choices the founder CEOs make may well reshape their companies as well as the Chinese economy,\" says Liu.</p> <p>Ren has resisted a stock exchange listing, but ownership could help shed light on the business and build trust. Huawei may have to open its own doors before America decides to do the same.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last week's budget had precious little to do with Britain's economic problems. George Osborne, whom I continue to regard as the most dangerous chancellor I have known \u2013 and there has been plenty of competition \u2013 made his policy bed in 2010. Unfortunately, it is the rest of the country that has to lie in it. By comparing our budgetary problems to those of Greece, Osborne demonstrated from the start that he had little perspective or judgment. Sadly, he was egged on in his austerity strategy by the Bank of England, which seemed to get into an unnecessary panic about a nonexistent funding crisis. The key strategic error made by Osborne was to absorb only one of the three great lessons of the decade to which the current financial crisis (we still have one) is often compared, namely the 1930s. The lesson that was undoubtedly learned is that it is perverse to react to a banking crisis by cutting the flow of money or credit: this was something that both Keynes and Friedman agreed on. Osborne has wilfully ignored the second great lesson of the 1930s, namely that fiscal contraction is not an efficacious way of emerging from a financial crisis. As for the third lesson, namely the contribution made to eventual recovery in the 1930s by a huge programme of housebuilding and infrastructure projects, the approach of this government has been, to use a word popular among schoolmasters in the old days, \"scatterbrained\". Although the Office for Budget Responsibility envisages quite a marked recovery in business investment from 2013, so far the positive impact of the austerity regime on new investment has been negligible, while central government investment, far from filling the gap in the private sector, fell 13% in real terms last year, and is budgeted to fall a further 5% this year and 3.6% in 2013. Housing was neglected by both the Thatcher/Major and the Blair/Brown governments. In a new collection of essays, The Red Book, published by Searching Finance, Eoin Clarke notes that, so far from offering a 1930s-style route out of recession, \"the number of net dwellings added to the UK housing stock is at a 10-year low. This shows that the problem has worsened under the current Tory government\". There is much talk of \"rebalancing\" towards investment and exports; there is a welcome rediscovery of the importance in a country the size of ours of manufacturing. But, as the business secretary, Vince Cable, complained in the runup to the budget, there is no plan for growth in circumstances when the economy is taking longer to emerge from depression than it did in the 1930s. Instead, there is vapid talk of tax incentives. I am sure I was not the only listener to be struck by a discrepancy between the chancellor's claim on the Today programme that reducing the 50p tax rate had induced GlaxoSmithKline to create 1,000 jobs in the UK and what GSK's chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, had to say on the subject. His careful explanation was that there were several factors involved, not least the new patent regime in this country (begun under Labour) and the way inflation in emerging economies is eroding their comparative advantage as a location for investment. He pointedly did not refer to the 50p tax decision. Which brings us inescapably to that controversial issue that, in the absence of any serious economic content in the speech, dominated, along with the so-called \"granny tax\", immediate post-budget discussion. There is a lot of mythology attached to taxation. Certainly, a top rate of 83% in the 1970s \u2013 and 98% for investment income \u2013 was absurdly high and encouraged avoidance. Sir Geoffrey Howe, in 1979, reduced the top rate to 60%. But even the Thatcherite Conservatives had the sensitivity to conclude that they could not do that without doing something for the others, so the standard rate was also reduced, from 33% to 30%. To finance this, they almost doubled VAT \u2013 from 8% to 15%, thereby not quite reneging on a pre-election promise not to double VAT. Did these dramatic cuts in the basic and top rates of tax produce an economic recovery? No: they were followed by what at that stage was the worst recession since the 1930s. But I distinctly remember that, once the cuts had been introduced, it was hoped that there would be less tax avoidance, and a diminution of the practice of offering \"perks\" in compensation for high tax rates. And was there? Not a bit of it. Then, some years later, came my old friend Nigel Lawson's 1988 budget, in which the number of different rates was reduced, and we entered the era of simplification, with two rates for income tax \u2013 a basic rate of 25% and a top rate of 40%. Did this lead to the end of unsavoury practices to get around these much lower rates? Again, not a bit of it. It was even argued that such tax cuts were self-financing \u2013 indeed, that they led to an increase in revenue. This was not apparent from the official documents accompanying that budget, which conceded that that there was a considerable budgetary cost of some \u00a36bn per annum. Now, one of the more outrageous aspects of the current controversy is the glib way in which figures for the 50p yield \u2013 ranging from zero to \u00a37bn, with \u00a32bn being common \u2013 are said to be negligible. In so far as the yield has been less than originally forecast, accountants have been falling over themselves to tell the press that sensible \"tax planning\" meant that many people have, one way or another, avoided paying the full 50%. The insensitivity of announcing the cut in the 50p rate at a time when the policy for the poor amounts to planned penury hardly needs elaboration. But the way the chancellor's acolytes have been saying things like \"it only brings in \u00a32bn\" is breathtaking. One only has to think of the extent of public services that are being cut back to raise such a sum. The chancellor's distorted logic takes the biscuit when we are told that as a quid pro quo for dropping the 50p rate, there will be a crackdown on tax avoidance. The crackdown should take place over the avoidance of the 50p! The government's pre-Keynesian contraction is already taking risks with the social fabric of this country. With his flouting of even mainstream public opinion over the 50p rate, the chancellor is almost deliberately encouraging social discontent \u2013 for no good economic reason.",

      "body": "<p>Ilene Lang feels sorry for women trying to clamber up the corporate ladder today. When she graduated from college in the 1960s, took an MBA at Harvard Business School and went on to found the early search engine AltaVista, she had so few female peers that she could make it up as she went along. She says: \"There was no career path then: nothing was expected of you. It was easier for me to spot an opportunity than to assume there was one there for me.\"</p> <p>Today, while the overt sexism that was the norm when she first started out in the workplace is now deemed less acceptable, she says many women still suffer at the hands of their male colleagues and clients. \"In those days, you expected it. Today, people expect that it's gone.\" Yet she says she has repeatedly been approached by senior female sales executives at conferences and told that even today \"they're expected to put out to get the sale\".</p> <p>As chief executive of the US women's empowerment group Catalyst, Lang has spent the past nine years battling to expose and overcome some of the covert barriers that prevent women from winning in the workplace. \"They get stuck in the middle, and they can't break into the top, and the question is why,\" she says during a visit to London earlier this month for a series of public events.</p> <p>Catalyst is now 50 years old. In its first 25 years, it was effectively a careers organisation: it helped women to polish up CVs and find mentors. In the 1980s, however, it became clear that the women it was helping were still hitting a roadblock.</p> <p>Ever since, the organisation has tried to find out why. It has carried out research into the progress of women in the workforce, and the barriers holding them back, in the US and around the world, and advises some of the US's largest firms about how to bring on the women in their ranks. Lang says three reasons have emerged for women's failure to break into the top ranks of business: limited access to \"informal networks\", whether that means chatting on the golf course or over a pint in the pub; gender stereotyping about what women are good at \u2013 and what they are not; and a lack of senior female role models.</p> <p>\"It starts from their very first job,\" she says. Catalyst has looked at a large cohort of MBA graduates, both men and women, from major universities in the US, Canada and the UK, and compared their career paths. Even after accounting for where they come from, their marital status and whether or not they have children, she says, there are still noticeable gender gaps on pay and on career paths. \"In their very first job, men are put in positions that have more opportunity and a faster trajectory into leadership.\"</p> <p>Myth-busting is one of Lang's favourite pastimes. She says it is not true, for example, that the reason women's pay lags behind that of their male colleagues is that they are not pushy enough to ask for a pay rise or a promotion.</p> <p>She says: \"It turns out that women do ask, but women who do negotiate on their own behalf are punished. In the same organisation in which men are rewarded for being aggressive, women are penalised.\"</p> <p>When Catalyst compared different career strategies, it found that men tend to be more successful when they move from one firm to another, bidding up their pay and responsibilities as they go, whereas the most successful women are those who stay put and prove themselves within a single organisation.</p> <p>\"There is a double standard,\" she says. \"Women are expected to perform more, and more often, before they get promoted. Men are promoted based on promise. If they move somewhere else, people say: 'Think of what this fresh blood's going to deliver!'\"</p> <p>Lang doesn't use the word prejudice to describe the attitudes of some men to the women they work with, but she does say one of the most interesting facets of Catalyst's findings is that, across a range of different cultures, gender \"trumps&#xa0;culture\".</p> <p>When Catalyst asked people in lots of different countries what men and women were good at, for example, \"whatever the leadership characteristic that is most valued in a particular culture, men thought men were better at it. We found that fascinating.\"</p> <p>Yet she says globalisation and technological change mean that it is now more important than ever to avoid the kind of narrow-minded groupthink among business decision-makers that can come from a single-sex board.</p> <p>\"We're a global village, there's no isolation any more. When you have these complex problems, you will get better results if you get more diversity of perspective and background.</p> <p>\"People who come from different places, whether it's geography, gender, background \u2013 they have different experiences. Those experiences really contribute to the perspectives that are considered and the ideas that are considered. Diverse teams produce more innovation.\"</p> <p>She says that is why Catalyst signs up companies that are keen to change the makeup of their management teams and works with them to nurture their female staff. \"The companies that are successful at this, they really believe in mentoring, they really believe in fairness of opportunity, they really believe that they have to be able to tap into the talent of all their&#xa0;people.\"</p> <p>But she admits that this step-by-step approach is not going to bring about an overnight revolution in the corporate world. \"It's one company at a time. But one company at a time, it's going to take forever, and there's not going to be much progress.\" Nevertheless, she insists she's not downhearted: \"You have to be an optimist to be in this business!\"</p>",

In the same organisation in which men are rewarded for being aggressive, women are penalised.\" When Catalyst compared different career strategies, it found that men tend to be more successful when they move from one firm to another, bidding up their pay and responsibilities as they go, whereas the most successful women are those who stay put and prove themselves within a single organisation. \"There is a double standard,\" she says. \"Women are expected to perform more, and more often, before they get promoted. Men are promoted based on promise. If they move somewhere else, people say: 'Think of what this fresh blood's going to deliver!'\" Lang doesn't use the word prejudice to describe the attitudes of some men to the women they work with, but she does say one of the most interesting facets of Catalyst's findings is that, across a range of different cultures, gender \"trumps culture\". When Catalyst asked people in lots of different countries what men and women were good at, for example, \"whatever the leadership characteristic that is most valued in a particular culture, men thought men were better at it. We found that fascinating.\" Yet she says globalisation and technological change mean that it is now more important than ever to avoid the kind of narrow-minded groupthink among business decision-makers that can come from a single-sex board. \"We're a global village, there's no isolation any more. When you have these complex problems, you will get better results if you get more diversity of perspective and background. \"People who come from different places, whether it's geography, gender, background \u2013 they have different experiences. Those experiences really contribute to the perspectives that are considered and the ideas that are considered. Diverse teams produce more innovation.\" She says that is why Catalyst signs up companies that are keen to change the makeup of their management teams and works with them to nurture their female staff. \"The companies that are successful at this, they really believe in mentoring, they really believe in fairness of opportunity, they really believe that they have to be able to tap into the talent of all their people.\" But she admits that this step-by-step approach is not going to bring about an overnight revolution in the corporate world. \"It's one company at a time. But one company at a time, it's going to take forever, and there's not going to be much progress.\" Nevertheless, she insists she's not downhearted: \"You have to be an optimist to be in this business!\"",
