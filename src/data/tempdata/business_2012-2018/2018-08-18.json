      "bodyText": "As we look on the events this week at the royal commission into the financial sector it is worth remembering that we are not hearing about the actions of banks and retail superannuation funds because the government wanted this news to be known. Malcolm Turnbull scorned Bill Shorten in parliament last year when he asked if the government would set up a royal commission. Turnbull suggested: \u201cWhat the leader of the oppposition is doing, in his gutlessness and in his pathetic populism, is promising years and years of lawyers.\u201d Turnbull continued: \u201cThe banks are not scared of a royal commission, sunshine. They have got plenty of lawyers and big law firms.\u201d You have to love the condescending use of \u201csunshine\u201d \u2013 I guess if you are going to be wrong, you might as well be arrogant about it. The week before the government did announce the royal commission, the minister for industry, innovation and science, Senator Matt Canavan, argued in a similar vein that it would \u201cturn into a bit of a lawyers\u2019 picnic and a waste of time\u201d. When announcing the commission, the prime minister kept insisting it was only necessary because \u201cuncertainty, however, over the potential for such an inquiry is starting to undermine confidence in our financial system\u201d and that \u201cthe reckless actions of Bill Shorten, the Greens and others\u201d in calling for a royal commission were \u201charming economic confidence and putting that at risk\u201d. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, described holding the commission as \u201cregrettable\u201d \u2013 not because the actions of those in the financial sector had led to its need, but because \u201cpolitics is doing damage to our banking and financial system\u201d. Peter Dutton then suggested the commission was good because it provided an opportunity to \u201chave a look at some aspects within the industry super funds which have union members and whatnot on the board\u201d. So no doubt he was looking forward to these past two weeks where the royal commission has turned its eyes towards the superannuation sector. Of course, to the surprise of no one except perhaps the minister for home affairs, it has found the retail side is a stinking cesspit, while the industry super funds have pretty much sailed through unscathed. Rather than not being scared of the royal commission, NAB for one have given the impression of fearing it greatly. Its lawyers held off providing documents for as long as possible, dumped 3,000 of them the week before the hearing and then tried repeatedly to prevent them being released publicly. The hearings found NAB was charging fees to dead superannuation customers and is now paying more than $100m in compensation to super customers who were falsely charged a service fee for general advice when they did not actually have an adviser linked to their account. So bad were the findings that at the end of the week NAB issued a public apology. We also heard that the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s wealth management arm, Colonial First State, committed more than 15,000 offences by failing to move thousands of members from high-fee funds into the low-fee MySuper regime in time to meet a government deadline. Suncorp waited until the last moment to do so \u2013 even though it was in members\u2019 interests to do it earlier. This week it was also AMP\u2019s turn to announce it would be paying compensation for those who ended up paying more in fees than they earned on their cash investments. So horrendous were the fees that one case was detailed where a person had invested $100,000 in cash and yet had actually lost money because the fees and charges were greater than the rate of return achieved. AMP Super suggested it was hamstrung by related parties such as financial advisers and investment managers whose fees were such they would outweigh the return on investments. Meanwhile, IOOF was revealed to have serious conflict of interest issues. For example the period in which IOOF Investment Management had responsibility of acting in the best interests of trustees as well as making a profit for shareholders. The royal commission has revealed that the fault in the retail superannuation sector is not a rogue organisation or just bad luck on the part of some banks, but that the system itself is geared towards poor returns and rewards for fund managers and advisers and the bank itself, rather than the members. Who would have guessed the sector of the superannuation industry that was geared towards profit would be the one that would most gouge superannuants in order to make a profit? Oh that\u2019s right, everyone. The old adage is never to hold a royal commission unless you know what it is going to find, but that wasn\u2019t the reason the government held off on holding this commission \u2013 it knew what it would reveal. It tried to limit the damage with some pretty limp terms of reference and a hope that talking about union-backed super funds would mean people would think there was a great scandal about to be revealed that had links to the ALP. But no. About the worst that was revealed was the industry super fund Hostplus had spent money wining and dining clients at the Australian Open. And while even the chief executive of Hostplus, David Elia, admitted he would rather not have to spend money on such hospitably, in Hostplus\u2019s favour was the fact that rather than having to apologise for its members losing money, it was the best performing super fund in 2017-18 and the fifth best over the past 10 years. So lacking in scandal were the industry super funds that the counsel assisting Michael Hodge QC stated that \u201cit is our view that the commission\u2019s review of documents identified fewer examples of types of conduct of the industry fund trustees that raise questions warranting oral consideration\u201d. That is, we don\u2019t even need you to front up to be cross-examined. In 2016 the minister for revenue and financial services, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, targeted the industry super funds saying the government wanted to \u201clift superannuation funds to at least the same standard as other financial services organisations like banks and life insurance companies\u201d. What the royal commission has shown is that this is the very last thing any government should be wishing to do. There are no guarantees in investing, and as every advert for superannuation always suggests, past performance is no indicator of future returns. But the royal commission has revealed that given their past performance, you would have to seriously question anyone advising you to have your super in a retail fund. And it also reveals that the government\u2019s arguments against the industry super sector have been completely destroyed. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australian columnist",

      "bodyText": "This week thousands of young people will learn how they performed in their GCSEs. One thing we already know is that the number of GCSE music entries is down over the last five years by 8%. Worse, performing and expressive arts entries have slumped by 26% over the period, while the number sitting exams in media, film and TV studies has dropped by 22% and drama entries are down 14%. Plenty of the great and the good from the performing arts have criticised the government for its GCSE reforms, which emphasise maths and science and demote arts subjects. In a letter to the Guardian, artists including Tracey Emin, Rachel Whiteread and Jeremy Deller warned that the return to \u201ctraditional\u201d subjects, heralded by the arrival of the Ebacc qualification, \u201cplaces one of our largest and most successful global industries at risk\u201d. One definition of the UK\u2019s creative industries shows they are worth \u00a392bn a year to the economy. As the artists pointed out, that is bigger than oil, gas, life sciences, automotive and aeronautics combined. The UK music industry alone added \u00a34.4bn to GDP in 2016, up from 4.1bn the year before. Exports rose by 13% to \u00a32.5bn. The summer music festival season, which draws to a close with the Reading and Leeds festivals next weekend, has enjoyed a revenue increase of 14%. These events are huge businesses that tap into something that people want to spend their money on. These days a hedge fund manager is just as likely to be seen dancing in a field in hot pants and covered in glitter as an art student taking time out from college (David Cameron at Wilderness, anyone?). More than 30 million people attended concerts or festivals in 2016, up from 26.7 million two years earlier. They have spin-off effects for the rest of the economy, giving young people who take the stage or work behind the scenes a chance to take their creativity into other areas. Deller said something that should be put on a poster in every government department entrance: \u201cThinking creatively is what is going to get Britain through a lot of the challenges of the next 10-20 years and that\u2019s exactly what the arts do, they free up the mind.\u201d Instead of this quote, ministers have joined those who belittle the performing arts and creative subjects in general as \u201csoft\u201d. Together, they believe the public likes the changes and the words that go with them, like rigorous, tough and challenging. That\u2019s not to say parents who put maths and science at the top of a subject hierarchy in the hope that their child becomes an engineer or its equivalent are wrong. The jobs that require people with a good education in maths are the bedrock of the economy. Yet Deller is right. The creative industries are where growth will come from. It is something that other countries struggle to do. Along with Sweden and the US, all the international studies show Britain to have one of the highest proportions of workers in creative industry jobs. The seed bed of this creativity is in schools and the community groups that promote different talents. As schools witness sharp falls in the number of students pursuing creative subjects, that leaves community groups to pick up the slack. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t look like happening. Since the Child Performance and Activities (England) Regulations took effect in 2015, many community groups that put on live music events with children have struggled to stay afloat. The red tape is forcing many to reconsider whether they carry on. Officials at the British and International Federation of Festivals say the rules mean local authorities ask volunteer groups for the same information they demand from professional theatres that put children on stage. The parents, carers or guardian of a seven-year-old playing the piano for a minute in a community centre in a local music competition must hand over information about their child\u2019s health and school as well as their address and phone number. Spreadsheets with hundreds of names arrive in council offices, but not before details have been negotiated with the parents, who have rights under the GDPR rules to know their information is secure. All it takes is for the child to be paid, the child to pay to enter the competition or the attendees to pay an entrance fee for the regulations to take effect (even if it\u2019s only 50p). There could be a more proportionate response from the Department for Education, which is the responsible ministry. It would be easy to blame the situation on Brexit or the lack of resources and time ministers can devote to any other subject. But as with GCSEs, there seems to be no will to support creativity. Instead, the dead hand of bureaucracy wins the day.",

More than 30&#xa0;million people attended concerts or festivals in 2016, up from 26.7&#xa0;million two years earlier.</p> <p>They have spin-off effects for the rest of the economy, giving young people who take the stage or work behind the scenes a chance to take their creativity into other areas.</p> <p>Deller said something that should be put on a poster in every government department entrance: \u201cThinking creatively is what is going to get Britain through a lot of the challenges of the next 10-20 years and that\u2019s exactly what the arts do, they free up the mind.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b74f416da61d3926f108ba29ae53354296c68ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b74f416da61d3926f108ba29ae53354296c68ec/305_449_3130_1879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former British prime minister David Cameron at the Wilderness festival 5 August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former British prime minister David Cameron at the Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire on 5 August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STRINGER/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of this quote, ministers have joined those who belittle the performing arts and creative subjects in general as \u201csoft\u201d. Together, they believe the public likes the changes and the words that go with them, like rigorous, tough and challenging.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say parents who put maths and science at the top of a subject hierarchy in the hope that their child becomes an engineer or its equivalent are wrong. The jobs that require people with a good education in maths are the bedrock of the economy.</p> <p>Yet Deller is right. The creative industries are where growth will come from. It is something that other countries struggle to do. Along with Sweden and the US, all the international studies show Britain to have one of the highest proportions of workers in creative industry jobs.</p> <p>The seed bed of this creativity is in schools and the community groups that promote different talents. As schools witness sharp falls in the number of students pursuing creative subjects, that leaves community groups to pick up the slack.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t look like happening. Since the Child Performance and Activities (England) Regulations took effect in 2015, many community groups that put on live music events with children have struggled to stay afloat. The red tape is forcing many to reconsider whether they carry on.</p> <p>Officials at the British and International Federation of Festivals say the rules mean local authorities ask volunteer groups for the same information they demand from professional theatres that put children on stage. The parents, carers or guardian of a seven-year-old playing the piano for a minute in a community centre in a local music competition must hand over information about their child\u2019s health and school as well as their address and phone number.</p> <p>Spreadsheets with hundreds of names arrive in council offices, but not before details have been negotiated with the parents, who have rights under the GDPR rules to know their information is secure.</p> <p>All it takes is for the child to be paid, the child to pay to enter the competition or the attendees to pay an entrance fee for the regulations to take effect (even if it\u2019s only 50p).</p> <p>There could be a more proportionate response from the Department for Education, which is the responsible ministry. It would be easy to blame the situation on Brexit or the lack of resources and time ministers can devote to any other subject. But as with GCSEs, there seems to be no will to support creativity. Instead, the dead hand of bureaucracy wins the day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kweku Adoboli, the former UBS trader who caused a $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn) financial loss \u2013 the biggest in UK history \u2013 has vowed to fight attempts by the Home Office to deport him from the UK to Ghana, his country of birth. Adoboli, 38, has not lived in Ghana since he was four years old and describes himself as British. He was freed after serving half of a seven-year sentence for two counts of fraud for abuse of his position at UBS, including one count relating to the unauthorised trading losses. However, he was acquitted of four counts of false accounting. Since his release from jail in 2015 he has given many talks to students, financial traders and others in the banking industry about how to operate ethically and avoid making the mistakes he made. \u201cI\u2019ve given talks to about 6,500 people from many different backgrounds about how to learn from failure and how to make decisions in difficult situations,\u201d said Adoboli. He reports once a month to the Home Office in Livingston in Scotland, where he lives, and fears that he may be arrested in preparation for deportation when he reports there on Monday, after he was denied permission to judicially review the deportation proceedings. Adoboli has appealed, asking the home secretary, Sajid Javid, not to deport him because of his longstanding ties with the UK and the fact that he is working hard to educate people to avoid making the same mistakes he made at UBS. \u201cThe home secretary is, like me, a former banker. He knows what change we need to deliver in this industry. He should recognise the devastating human cost to me of being deported to Ghana,\u201d Adoboli said. He added that he believed the hostile environment at the Home Office continued despite reports that the government department has softened its stance in many areas of its immigration policy. \u201cI believe I\u2019m being used as an example by the Home Office,\u201d said Adoboli. His solicitor, Jacqueline McKenzie, is hoping to lodge a fresh claim with the Home Office about Adoboli\u2019s case on Monday morning. She said the case raises wider issues about deportation of offenders who have grown up in the UK and are settled here. \u201cThis is a really unfair situation for Kweku,\u201d she said. Earlier this week, a court denied him permission for a judicial review of the deportation proceedings, and granted a request by the Home Office to be allowed to deport him even if he renews his application for a review. \u201cThe current challenge is very substantially out of time,\u201d said Lord Justice Lane said in his ruling. Under British law, foreign nationals who are sentenced to longer than four years in prison are automatically subject to being deported, unless they can argue that there are compelling reasons to allow them to stay in the country. Adoboli has launched a CrowdJustice campaign to raise funds to help pay his legal bills. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAll foreign nationals who are given a custodial sentence will be considered for removal. \u201cForeign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them and we have removed more than 42,800 foreign offenders since 2010.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "With Brexit looming, energy sector builds new links to Europe", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "While Westminster attempts to deliver Brexit within months, the UK\u2019s energy system is set to become dramatically more dependent on the EU just as Britain leaves. Today, four cables \u2013 known as interconnectors \u2013 between the UK and Ireland, France and the Netherlands have a capacity of 4GW, providing around 6% of Britain\u2019s power supplies. However, with 11 new connections linking the UK and other European countries either under construction or mooted by developers, imports could provide more than a fifth of the country\u2019s electricity needs by 2025, the government expects. As the UK\u2019s Brexit white paper said in understated fashion: \u201cThere has been a trend towards greater interconnectivity that has brought mutual benefits to trading partners.\u201d Leading the charge is National Grid, which is behind three of the 11 new proposed cables. Jon Butterworth, who heads the group\u2019s interconnectors business, said: \u201cFrom our perspective, and from the perspective of the general public, there\u2019s not a lot of downsides to interconnectors.\u201d The company argues the links are good for consumers because lower wholesale prices on the continent will translate to cheaper energy bills in the UK. Households will save \u00a39.01 a year once the 13.9GW of new capacity has come online, it calculates. That may not be much off the \u00a31,138 average annual bill, but it would almost offset the cost of Hinkley Point C, the nuclear power station that will add at least \u00a310 to bills. National Grid says interconnectors are vital to make electricity networks more flexible, a priority as more wind and solar power comes online. Butterworth said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can do it [renewables] without them. As you get more and more intermittent renewable energy, to use it at the right time and get it into the right place, interconnection is vital.\u201d Interconnectors have obvious appeal as a source of growth for the company, which is mulling job cuts in response to regulator Ofgem proposing tougher price controls on its core business, the UK\u2019s national electricity network. Brexit poses one obvious risk, with the prospect of trading energy across borders becoming harder. The Brexit white paper stressed the need for efficient trade across interconnectors. But National Grid and its European counterparts, who develop the cables through joint ventures, believe the fundamentals remain unchanged. \u201cWhen you talk to very senior civil servants [in Brussels], they say we still believe interconnectors are great things for Europe,\u201d said Butterworth. He rejected criticism that the cables threatened energy security and would not be subject to the UK\u2019s carbon tax, charges usually levelled at interconnectors by firms that wanted to build big gas power stations in Britain. \u201cSome of the generators express their views,\u201d said Butterworth. \u201c[But] why would a generator in France be less reliable than a generator in the middle of England?\u201d Industry experts broadly agree that greater interconnection is a good thing in a world with more renewables, but there is no consensus on how much. \u201cThe question is: what is the optimal level of interconnection? There is a hole in thinking,\u201d said Peter Atherton, analyst at Cornwall Insight. He believes the links have played an important role in the UK\u2019s energy system. Cheaper power from Europe sounds like good news for households hit by tariff rises blamed on rising wholesale costs. But if wholesale prices went too low it could hurt the economics of UK-based power stations. \u201cA low wholesale price is not necessarily a good thing,\u201d said Atherton. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept dumping of other things.\u201d National Grid\u2019s dual role as builder of interconnectors and manager of balancing electricity supplies has also raised questions about its vested interests. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there is conflict of interest, but there is potential,\u201d said Atherton. Other companies are building cables through the Channel tunnel, and planning to connect to electricity supplies as far away as Germany. National Grid\u2019s link to Belgium is its first to come online, in early 2019. It will be followed by a second connection to France in 2020, and then the world\u2019s longest subsea interconnector to Norway. The company is not ruling out more radical ideas, including interconnectors for a Dutch-backed island in the North Sea surrounded by windfarms. Butterworth said: \u201cIt\u2019s just something we need to take a good, hard look at. It\u2019s not crazy. You\u2019ve got to sometimes push the boundary.\u201d",

Investors who put their money in safe havens after the 2012 Greek crisis are nervous again. The FTSE Emerging Index of stocks in the developing world tumbled last week, taking the decline in its value since the beginning of the year to more than 20%. It is not only the US president troubling investors though. The country\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, has quadrupled interest rates in the last couple of years. Countries that borrowed heavily in dollars to fund their growth face the prospect of paying a heavy price in extra interest payments. It is a crippling bill that has already forced Argentina to seek help from the International Monetary Fund. Others could follow: Turkey The arrest and charging of Andrew Brunson, a US evangelist pastor based in Izmir on Turkey\u2019s Aegean coast, riled Trump and triggered tit-for-tat trade sanctions. Trump accused the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, of undermining human rights but rather than pursue the case through diplomatic channels, he imposed higher tariffs on Turkish exports of steel, aluminium and cars. Erdo\u011fan retaliated with higher import duties on US alcohol, cars and tobacco. The US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said last week he was prepared to escalate the row with a second round of sanctions. Turkey was already in a vulnerable position. Some of its biggest businesses have grown quickly in the last 10 years fuelled by cheap credit. This credit costs much more now, leaving companies that need to remortgage their loans with crippling refinancing costs. The Turkish lira has dropped 40% in value since January as investors, believing the country could be forced to agree a rescue bailout from the International Monetary Fund, have deserted. India India is a big importer of everything from crude oil and electronics to gold, on which the country is expected to spend around $600bn (\u00a3471bn) in this financial year. Its trade deficit widened to $18bn in July, the highest figure in more than five years. With trade tariff threats and other protectionist measures being put in place by the Trump administration, specifically on steel and aluminium, inflation could rise toward 5% from the 4.2% reported last month. Like Turkish firms, Indian companies have also raised vast funds overseas at cheap loan rates and are worried about the rise in servicing costs. The country\u2019s external debt rose to $530bn at the end of March, of which 42% constituted debt maturing by March next year, almost certainly at higher rates. No wonder the rupee has tumbled this year to a record low, though the 9% fall is modest compared with other emerging market economies. Argentina Buenos Aires shares similar vulnerabilities to Turkey in the shape of twin deficits (in its public spending balance of payments and need to refinance loans with US banks). After a month of relative calm for the peso, the Turkey crisis prompted the Argentinian currency to tumble. It triggered a quick response from the country\u2019s central bank, which increased interest rates by five percentage points to 45%. Argentina is also dealing with a huge political corruption scandal. A former vice-president has been sent to jail and more officials are expected to follow. It has already agreed an IMF bailout. South Africa South Africa, Ukraine, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil are all dealing with depreciating currencies because of worries about their stability in a world riven with destabilising trade tariffs. Aside from the Turkish lira and Argentine peso, the worst-hit emerging market currency last week was South Africa\u2019s rand, which fell by more than 10% on Monday. The country\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, who took over from Jacob Zuma in February, has promised to revitalise the country\u2019s economy but faces a public sector deficit, a balance of payments deficit and persistent corruption scandals. Ramaphosa has succeeded in wining pledges from Saudi Arabia and China to invest huge sums in the country\u2019s infrastructure and financial system but it has not proved enough yet to placate nervous investors. And ... China Many analysts believe the trials faced by Turkey are a sideshow compared to Beijing\u2019s problems. China has wrestled with slowing GDP growth and the Trump trade war for a year and Xi Jinping seems content to respond with measures that just make Trump madder. The central bank is pumping money into its financial system to make lending cheaper, which has had the effect of driving the yuan lower against the dollar. This is the opposite move to the US Federal Reserve, which is winding down quantitative easing and raising interests to make lending more expensive. While Trump lauds the strong dollar in his tweets, he is furious at the low value of the yuan, which makes Chinese imports into the US cheaper and offsets the effect of any tariffs he levies. Some investors believe it will lead Trump to double the tariffs. To make matters worse, some of China\u2019s biggest companies have reported a decline in profits in recent weeks.",
