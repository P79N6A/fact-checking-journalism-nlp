      "standfirst": "Economists widely expect another \u00a350bn in quantitative easing when the Bank announces its latest policy decision on Thursday", 
      "body": "<p>The Bank of England is widely expected to set the printing presses in motion again this week by announcing billions more in its quantitative easing programme.</p> <p>But with unemployment stubbornly high, businesses bemoaning the fact that they face barriers to obtaining loans and economic growth looking shaky, voices are growing louder suggesting policymakers should find better ways of directing the cash.</p> <p>Economists widely expect another \u00a350bn from the Bank when it announces its latest policy decision at noon on Thursday. That would take its quantitative easing programme to a total of \u00a3325bn.</p> <p>It was a scheme launched in 2009 against the backdrop of markets reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers and rates already almost as low as they could go. The Bank argued that inflation was on course to undershoot the government-set target of 2% and so the Bank would start creating money to buy up assets, primarily British government bonds, known as gilts. Sir Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, pledged the money would \"percolate\" through the economy.</p> <p>Fast-forward three years and inflation is well above target while credit conditions for most businesses remain tight, despite the Bank's big liquidity injections.</p> <p>Many economists stand by the view that QE was the best response to a bad situation. Others say the billions of QE that may be still to come would be better spent elsewhere than in the gilt market.</p> <p>For David Kern, chief economist at the <a href=\"http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Chambers of Commerce</a> (BCC) the problem is that those smaller companies that drive job creation in the UK are not getting help to grow and unemployment is likely to stay high until they do.</p> <p>He concedes the situation would have been much worse without any QE but says there have been shortfalls nonetheless. \"The main area in which QE did not have its full effect is on lending, particularly on bank lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),\" he said.</p> <p>Kern added that he would have liked to see the Bank buying assets beyond gilts, something discussed at the start of the programme in 2009 but barely realised. In his eyes, QE could have been used to buy bonds from commercial banks that are made up of their bank loans to businesses, also known as securitised lending.</p> <p>The lobby group said the onus was on chancellor George Osborne to supplement QE with his long-promised \"credit easing\".</p> <p>Referring to proposals for a bank dedicated to lending to smaller businesses, Kern said: \"Looking forward and being practical what we need now is to implement an effective credit easing programme as early as possible and if that doesn't work, create an SME bank.\"</p> <p>In its own research the Bank argues that QE has a significant positive effect on the economy, boosting output and keeping inflation closer to target than it would otherwise have been.</p> <p>There are many in financial markets who back the Bank on this.</p> <p><strong>\"</strong>History should judge the Bank of England and its QE policy favourably,\" said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank.<strong> </strong>\"At the height of the worst credit crunch and recession in living memory, the BoE did pretty much everything in its power to prevent a more pronounced contraction. It is possible that inflation ends up being higher than it might otherwise have been, but that is a small price worth paying.\"</p> <p>The Bank has also noted in <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/workingpapers/wp442.pdf\" title=\"\">working papers</a> a significant reduction in bond yields from QE. That is something that does get passed on beyond financial markets, said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank in London.</p> <p><strong>\"</strong>For larger businesses that issue bonds the impact will have been a direct reduction in interest rates, given that they usually borrow at a spread over government bonds.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is widely expected to set the printing presses in motion again this week by announcing billions more in its quantitative easing programme. But with unemployment stubbornly high, businesses bemoaning the fact that they face barriers to obtaining loans and economic growth looking shaky, voices are growing louder suggesting policymakers should find better ways of directing the cash. Economists widely expect another \u00a350bn from the Bank when it announces its latest policy decision at noon on Thursday. That would take its quantitative easing programme to a total of \u00a3325bn. It was a scheme launched in 2009 against the backdrop of markets reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers and rates already almost as low as they could go. The Bank argued that inflation was on course to undershoot the government-set target of 2% and so the Bank would start creating money to buy up assets, primarily British government bonds, known as gilts. Sir Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, pledged the money would \"percolate\" through the economy. Fast-forward three years and inflation is well above target while credit conditions for most businesses remain tight, despite the Bank's big liquidity injections. Many economists stand by the view that QE was the best response to a bad situation. Others say the billions of QE that may be still to come would be better spent elsewhere than in the gilt market. For David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) the problem is that those smaller companies that drive job creation in the UK are not getting help to grow and unemployment is likely to stay high until they do. He concedes the situation would have been much worse without any QE but says there have been shortfalls nonetheless. \"The main area in which QE did not have its full effect is on lending, particularly on bank lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),\" he said. Kern added that he would have liked to see the Bank buying assets beyond gilts, something discussed at the start of the programme in 2009 but barely realised. In his eyes, QE could have been used to buy bonds from commercial banks that are made up of their bank loans to businesses, also known as securitised lending. The lobby group said the onus was on chancellor George Osborne to supplement QE with his long-promised \"credit easing\". Referring to proposals for a bank dedicated to lending to smaller businesses, Kern said: \"Looking forward and being practical what we need now is to implement an effective credit easing programme as early as possible and if that doesn't work, create an SME bank.\" In its own research the Bank argues that QE has a significant positive effect on the economy, boosting output and keeping inflation closer to target than it would otherwise have been. There are many in financial markets who back the Bank on this. \"History should judge the Bank of England and its QE policy favourably,\" said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank. \"At the height of the worst credit crunch and recession in living memory, the BoE did pretty much everything in its power to prevent a more pronounced contraction. It is possible that inflation ends up being higher than it might otherwise have been, but that is a small price worth paying.\" The Bank has also noted in working papers a significant reduction in bond yields from QE. That is something that does get passed on beyond financial markets, said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank in London. \"For larger businesses that issue bonds the impact will have been a direct reduction in interest rates, given that they usually borrow at a spread over government bonds. For smaller businesses the impact may be less direct. But to the extent that banks sell some of their gilt holdings to the BoE they can lend more to small businesses,\" he said. Economists are divided over how much more QE is on the horizon, especially following tentative signs last week that economic activity is picking up. But if there is more to come this month and again later in the year, economists at Fathom Consulting have radical suggestions for how to use the money. They say QE is targeting the wrong problems and that the return on the programme has been \"weak at best, and at worst it may have caused actual harm\". Fathom argues instead for changes that would direct any fresh electronic cash at what it sees as the source of the UK's economic crisis: an overvalued UK housing market. Its solution involves QE being used to kickstart wider investor interest in new bonds backed by troubled assets. Fathom wants the Treasury to set up a \"bad bank\" through which the government can purchase troubled mortgage-backed assets that are weighing down commercial banks' balance sheets, at an appropriate discount. This \"bad bank\" should then be allowed to issue a bond backed by these troubled assets, which the BoE should buy via another round of QE. Danny Gabay, director at Fathom Consulting, believes that would restore the UK to a path of growth by finally tackling deep-seated debt problems born of the credit boom that preceded the financial crisis. \"The solution to this massive debt overhang which encompasses both public and household balance sheets is categorically not more debt,\" he said. The MPC itself is by no means unanimous in feeling more gilts purchases are the only way to plough on with QE. For policymaker Adam Posen, who, like Kern, favours a bank dedicated to small business lending, QE needs to go beyond government assets. He has been urging the government to ramp up pressure on banks to lend, demanding new rules for banks rather than just credit easing promises as made last autumn. As for what the BoE can do, Posen has signalled his support for more QE on Thursday, but also advocated the BoE buying assets other than government bonds as part of the programme. As Posen and his colleagues weigh up the pros and cons of more QE, they will be comforted by the fact that the latest round of criticism is nothing new and by no means restricted to the UK. Economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) recently trawled through research into the effects of QE programmes, including in Japan last decade. They conclude that few studies have been able to \"confidently identify\" evidence of an effect on the availability of bank credit. In other words: \"The transmission to the real economy may be less effective than suggested.\" As they note, such scepticism is longstanding. In an open letter to President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933, John Maynard Keynes likened policies that aimed to raise output and income by increasing the supply of money in circulation as \"like trying to get fat by buying a larger belt\".",

Then we must a set a date for removing the taxpayer guarantee on the investment banks.\"",

      "bodyText": "Stephen Hester, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, has revealed that he had considered resigning during the furore over his near-\u00a31m bonus, but decided it would be too \"indulgent\" to do so. Speaking in the cavernous white office once occupied by his predecessor Fred Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood last week, Hester admitted that he could not win what he described as \"the societal argument\" about the size of his pay. His salary is \u00a31.2m a year but annual bonuses and longer-term plans can push it up to more than five times that amount. He made it clear that while he did not set his own pay, he was a \"commercial animal\" and wanted to be paid as such. Asked why he needed a bonus at all, he said: \"One doesn't need it. No one in this room, none of you \u2013 even if you're not on the same salary as me \u2013 no one is starving and by those standards one can't win this discussion.\" Fresh from an interview on Radio 4's Today programme in which he described his job as defusing \"the biggest time bomb in history\", Hester admitted being concerned about the long-term impact of the political furore surrounding his bonus, but refused to respond to any of the politicians who have singled out the RBS boss and his pay packet for criticism. He did, however, concede that the bank and the government needed to \"regroup\" and reconsider the fact that RBS was run as a commercial enterprise, despite being 83% owned by the taxpayer after its \u00a345bn bailout. The political row over his bonus, he said, posed a question about whether RBS's recovery and the aim of getting back the taxpayer's \u00a345bn would be \"impeded by us having some uncomfortable halfway house \u2026 expecting us to pay differently to everyone else and achieve differently than everyone else.\" In stark contrast to the immaculately tidy desk of his predecessor, Hester's workstation was strewn with papers. The office walls were adorned with pictures of his 350-acre estate in Oxfordshire, which is tended by eight gardeners. The bank's financial results for 2011 will be published in a fortnight and will set out the size of the bonus pool for its investment bankers \u2013 who are dwindling in number owing to a restructuring announced last month. Hester refused to be drawn on the scale of the payout likely to go to the head of the investment bank, John Hourican, saying it would be \"invidious\" to discuss the matter. But he seemed to indicate that bonuses must be paid. \"We should be at the restrained end of the market in which we compete, but we should recognise that our people are doing a damned good job,\" he said. The 51-year-old was skiing in Switzerland on the Sunday night when he decided to waive his bonus. He made his decision hours after Labour had called a debate on the award to Hester of 3.6m shares \u2013 and on Wednesday he told the Today programme that he had considered resigning: \"I'm certainly not a robot and there have been some deeply depressing moments. In the end I came to the conclusion it would be indulgent for me to resign, and what I ought to do was draw on the reserves of strength I have.\" The divorced father of two teenagers admitted to having had \"everything \u2026 emotionally, physically, intellectually\" tied up in RBS for the last three years and he did not want to \"toss it away\" in a moment of pressure. \"If there's a quality that got me to where I am in business, it's wanting to win for my company. The moments when I have hesitations are when there are obstacles that are going to be difficult to get over,\" he said. Usually a man who shuns interviews, Hester stressed that he did not want to be a politician or be \"in the papers all the time\". Shortly after he was appointed in October 2008, the bank reported the biggest loss in UK corporate history of \u00a324bn and Hester admitted on Tuesday that the bank had incurred \u00a338bn of costs trying to clean up the mess. However, it has also generated \u00a333bn of profit before bad debt charges. Hester said he had been lured to RBS from British Land \u2013 a role in which he had been \"perfectly happy\" and had deliberately taken on to prove he could be more than a banker after a career at Credit Suisse and Abbey National. He took the RBS job on the basis it would be run in a commercial way \u2013 \"some would say in a hard-nosed way\". \"I attempt to be commercial in the results I get, and I want to be commercial in the way I'm treated. I'm happy for that to be at the restrained end [of the pay scale], albeit in a societal debate I can't win,\" Hester said. \"If I only worked for money I wouldn't do this job \u2013 but that isn't to say I don't care about money,\" he added. Hester appeared to admit that he has had approaches about other roles since the bonus row. \"People have been very kind in all sorts of different ways, but my preference is to succeed at RBS.\"",

    "webTitle": "Thomas Cook investors express anger at high levels of executive pay", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Small investors hit out at the Thomas Cook board during an angry shareholder meeting on Wednesday, demanding to know why former chief executive Manny Fontenla-Novoa received a payoff of \u00a31.17m after leaving last summer in the wake of a heavy profits warning. Peter Middleton, chairman of the board's remuneration subcommittee, defended the move, insisting Fontenla-Novoa's severance had been determined by a binding contract that had been backed by shareholders. Middleton did not face a shareholder vote after making clear last month that he had \"decided to retire to allow new chairman Frank Meysman more flexibility to refresh the board\". Fellow remuneration committee member Bo Lerenius and Roger Burnell have also announced plans to leave. Fontenla-Novoa received a total pay package for 2011 of \u00a32.26m in cash and shares, taking his total pay over less than five years to \u00a317.2m. It is thought the departure of key directors involved in setting Thomas Cook's executive pay helped avert a heavy protest vote at Wednesday's meeting. The formal count is yet to be announced, but early indications are that almost 9% of shareholders voted against pay arrangements. Acknowledging widespread anger over the arrangements, Meysman told assembled investors in a prepared statement: \"Certain aspects of executive pay in the past\u2026 have been rightly criticised by shareholders, both at previous AGMs and in the regular dialogue with institutional shareholders.\" He said he had introduced a new pay regime, with greater emphasis on deferred bonuses and with the possibility of bonus clawback in the event of later poor performance. Meysman is currently consulting with investors about new long-term incentive arrangements as he is in the final stages of recruiting a successor to Fontenla-Novoa. Investors had long been angered by pay awards for the former Thomas Cook boss. A vote over boardroom pay in 2008 received just 4% support from independent shareholders after the award of a one-off \u00a35m bonus to Fontenla-Novoa. The resolution was only carried because of the voting might of German group Arcandor, which then held 52% of Thomas Cook shares but slipped into bankruptcy months later. A small shareholder who had raised objections to executive pay also criticised Thomas Cook's decision, confirmed on Wednesday morning, to put its business in India up for sale. He said such a move was a \"mistake\" as India was a strong, emerging market. The disposal is part of an urgent series of asset sales the tour operator hopes will raise \u00a3200m to help reduce its huge debts. The group is thought to have seen seasonal borrowings peak at about \u00a31.5bn at the end of last year. Separately, before the meeting opened, Thomas Cook issued a trading update revealing underlying losses for the last three months of 2011 had widened from \u00a337m to \u00a391m, hit by rising fuel costs and political uncertainty in north Africa. Interim chief executive Sam Weihagen said that, contrary to suggestions from some rivals, sales in the UK were \"broadly stable\". He said sales of traditional package summer breaks to British holidaymakers were down 9% compared with this time last year; however, the company has further reduced the number of summer holidays on offer. Its planned summer capacity had been cut by 8% eight weeks ago and is now cut by 11%. Weihagen said a review of holiday capacity was ongoing.",

      "bodyText": "Mothercare has poached the chief executive of LoveFilm to lead its turnaround efforts. Simon Calver, a former management consultant and branding expert, ran the home video and video game rental company for almost seven years, taking the business through a merger with rival group Video Island before selling up to Amazon in a deal thought to value the business at \u00a3200m a year ago. He is believed to have made a considerable amount from the sale. The chairman of Mothercare, Alan Parker, removed the previous chief executive, Ben Gordon, \"by mutual consent\" in October, two weeks after a heavy profits warning. Gordon had led the business for nine years. The company's shares lost a third of their value after the autumn profits warning and have not recovered, although they rose 4% to 208p on Wednesday on news of Calver's appointment. The stock is among a band of high street retailers heavily targeted by short sellers, who bet on the price of shares falling. Parker, the former chief executive of Whitbread, who had been at Mothercare less than two months before the profits warning, has been leading the executive team on an interim basis since Gordon's departure. He has blamed the group's recent troubles on the fact that it \"lost its way in its home market\". In an urgent effort to cut costs Mothercare is closing more than 100 of its 350 UK stores over a two-year period. Its profits have been squeezed as cash-strapped parents have spent less on more expensive items such as pushchairs. Commenting on Calver's appointment, Parker said: \"He is a highly successful business leader with experience heading multinational consumer facing organisations. His e-commerce and brand expertise will enable Mothercare to accelerate its development as a multi-channel retailer in the UK and his international perspective will be invaluable to the continued rapid expansion of Mothercare and Early Learning Centre globally.\" The group announced a half-year underlying pretax loss of \u00a34.4m in November, and last month it said UK comparable sales over the Christmas and new year period had been down 3%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The company behind the Superdry brand has issued a warning on profits and placed its store opening plans under review, four weeks after telling investors the business had enjoyed a \"solid Christmas\" with \"an improving sales trend\". SuperGroup issued a fresh trading update on Wednesday saying its sales for the last three weeks of January were lower than anticipated, warning investors its full-year profits were likely to scrape in at the lower end of City expectations. Analysts had been expecting profits of between \u00a350m and \u00a354m after a previous profits warning in October. Analysts said the two trading updates implied SuperGroup's comparable sales had been up 9.3% for December but had then fallen by about 3.5% during the first four weeks of January. The news sent SuperGroup shares tumbling 18% to 573p. The company quickly became a stock market darling after floating in March 2010 at 500p, sending the share price to \u00a318.98 within a year before a series of reverses. The chief executive, Julian Dunkerton, played down the significance of the latest trading figures. He said: \"Three weeks ago we were in the top six retailers across the high street in terms of Christmas sales. This [latest update] is only three weeks of trading. It is a small snapshot. A small percentage of our annual sales.\" He said January's performance had been hit in part by heavy discounts from rivals. \"A lot of our competitor brands had the heaviest sales I have ever seen.\" Some observers were surprised, however, that SuperGroup had been unable to identify this trend by the time of its trading update on 11 January. Indeed, SuperGroup claimed to have had a \"very strong\" first week of January. The business has rapidly added new stores in recent years and now has 76 shops and 74 concessions in the UK as well as 116 overseas. Wayne Brown, an analyst at Collins Stewart, said: \"We remain concerned that UK \u2026 sales growth remains below the rate of [store] expansion.\" The business remains on track to add 20 stores in its current financial year, but by mid-morning it confirmed it would now review future store opening plans. The group had expected to open about 20 shops of between 3,000 sq ft and 5,000 sq ft, but Dunkerton suggested the future was likely to involve a smaller number of much larger stores. The business last year reputedly paid \u00a312m for the lease to a large store on Regent Street, in London, which is to be its flagship outlet. The company had been described by some as a UK version of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, though critics have suggested the business was heavily dependent on branded hoodies and risked falling foul of fast-changing fashions. Dunkerton said: \"Retail sales during the quarter have been mixed, with a challenging last three weeks of January.\" Freddie George, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, cut his pre-tax profit forecast for SuperGroup by \u00a32m to \u00a352m. He insisted the stock, which divides opinion across the City, was undervalued.",
