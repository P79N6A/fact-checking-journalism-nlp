      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s chief executives are wildly overpaid, and there would be no negative impact on the economy if their salaries were slashed, a groundbreaking study of the country\u2019s top headhunters reveals. The London School of Economics report is a damning indictment of the state of executive pay, and comes as an analysis of FTSE 100 company accounts shows that the average pay package of a top CEO is now \u00a34.6m a year. Interviews with the top 10 international recruitment firms behind 70-90% of chief executive appointments in recent years found a consensus among so-called corporate kingmakers that levels of remuneration for the most senior executives are \u201cabsurdly high\u201d. Headhunters claimed that, for every appointment of a CEO, another 100 people could have filled the role just as ably, and that many chosen for top jobs were \u201cmediocre\u201d. The market for executive jobs, however, has become so distorted that it would amount to career suicide for a chief executive to indicate that he or she would be willing to work for less. The study\u2019s authors write: \u201cIf one were to offer to do the job for less, would that tip the decision in his or her favour? All the headhunters agreed that this would be a poor strategy. \u201cIndeed, it might be that asking for a larger remuneration would have a positive effect in securing the appointment.\u201d They go on: \u201cThere was almost universal agreement among the search firms that levels of remuneration for CEOs in large UK non-financial firms was absurdly high. All the interviews supported the notion of an arbitrary norm for pay, which almost all firms felt was grossly and inappropriately high \u2026 The general view of search firms is that a lower norm would not materially affect what happens.\u201d One headhunter said: \u201cI think there are an awful lot of FTSE 100 CEOs who are pretty mediocre.\u201d Another added: \u201cI think that the wage drift over the past 10 years, or the salary drift, has been inexcusable, incomprehensible, and it is very serious for the social fabric of the country.\u201d The findings are being made public just as an analysis by the High Pay Centre thinktank shows that the average pay of a chief executive \u2013 including pensions, share options and bonuses \u2013 stands at about \u00a34.6m. The thinktank analysed the figures of the 32 FTSE 100 firms to have filed accounts for 2015. Amid concerns that executive pay in Britain is now hundreds of times that of the average employee of a firm, extreme examples of remuneration emerged. Morrisons\u2019 CEO Dalton Philips nearly doubled his remuneration to \u00a32.1m in the year before he was sacked, while Tesco boss Dave Lewis received \u00a34.1m \u2013 nearly three times the amount paid to his predecessor. The figures reported in company accounts \u2013 as required under guidelines established in 2013 to make pay comparisons easier \u2013 could even understate the level of pay given the unpredictability of bonuses. Max Steuer, reader emeritus at the LSE and author of the new research paper, Headhunter Methods for CEO Selection, published in the Journal of General Management, said there was little evidence that lower pay would see a \u201cbrain drain\u201d, as has been suggested. \u201cIn Denmark and other continental countries, the CEOs don\u2019t get this high pay but they don\u2019t seem to leave. The idea that if their pay were lower, British executives could show up in New York and say we would like to have your jobs, is a little implausible. I think the best way of thinking about it is that performance plays very little role in the selection process. Contrary to people saying these chief executives are \u2018unusually able\u2019, we don\u2019t find any evidence of that. \u201cI am a great defender of capitalism and the market and what worries me about all this is that it threatens to erode the market.\u201d Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said there was a systemic problem in executive pay, which may be resolved through greater involvement of employee representatives in the remuneration process. \u201cThere is much less of a \u2018global market\u2019 than people claim. The problem here is really systemic. It\u2019s not just the headhunters\u2019 fault. Institutional investors, company remuneration committees, pay consultancies and CEOs themselves could all show greater restraint. \u201cHaving employee representatives involved in this process could help. Some top bosses, it seems, are keen to manage all their costs \u2013 except the cost of employing them.\u201d",

Almost 200 people were prosecuted and 100 convicted of tobacco excise fraud during that period.

      "bodyText": "High Street, Gosforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Early March. Really, it ought to be raining, but instead the Greggs sign \u2013 four orange squares on a blue background \u2013 is bathed in sunshine. They say you should write what you know and, at last, my career has brought me to a wall of hot baked goods. I join the back of the lunch queue and ponder my options. As ever, it is hard to look past the sausage rolls. And, as ever, the first bite dispels any suspicions about their precise composition. This rich, golden experience costs 80p. The flat white I wash it down with is only \u00a31.75, 40p cheaper than Pret a Manger, and just as tasty. The atmosphere is friendly, the customers varied. Prams jostle for parking space by the loos. Older couples idly stir tea. Retired nurse Denise Massey (ham and cheese baguette, coffee) has popped in between acupuncture and pilates. Finance director Chris Alete (toastie, salt and vinegar Squares, sausage roll) is in the area on business. Seventeen-year-old Deni Stafford (toastie, chilli heatwave Doritos, Dr Pepper) is on a lunch break from her job at the hairdresser round the corner. Britain is a Greggs nation, and the preeminent high-street bakery has had a good week. On Tuesday, it announced a 25% rise in pre-tax profits, to \u00a373m, on sales of \u00a3835.7m. This is no flash in the pan: last year, profits for the first six months rose by 51%. The share price rose on the latest announcement. Cuts were announced, too. Three of its 12 main bakeries will be shut, with 335 jobs potentially lost, but the company stressed that this was part of a broader \u00a3100m plan for expansion \u2013 and, at any rate, 1.7% of its roughly 20,000 employees does not seem swingeing. Greggs has 1,698 outlets, more than McDonalds\u2019 or Starbucks, and plans to take this figure beyond 2,000. It shifts more than 2.5m sausage rolls per week, and 1m cups of coffee. The figures were a triumph for CEO Roger Whiteside, a veteran of Ocado and Marks &amp; Spencer, who was hired in 2013 and set about repositioning the bakery as a \u201cfood-on-the-go\u201d brand rather than a \u201ctake-home\u201d bakery. \u201cWe realised we weren\u2019t going to win the battle against the supermarkets for the take-home baked goods,\u201d he tells me. \u201cInstead, we had to deploy our bakery skills to sell our products for instant consumption.\u201d This means sandwiches, soups and salads rather than just loaves and cakes, and a range of healthier options, too. The lower-calorie range now accounts for 10% of sales, and the figure is growing. \u201cEverybody pops into Greggs for something at some point, but often that\u2019s because they\u2019re treating themselves. What we\u2019re saying is: we want to be there for you, for breakfast, lunch and snacking.\u201d Gosforth is the Greggs ground zero. It was just down the road that John Gregg inherited a family yeast-and-eggs business in 1939, delivering baked goods by bicycle before opening the first shop in 1951, on Gosforth High Street. The original store was bought by a travel agency, which remains today \u2013 in a back room, staff showed me the outline of where the Greggs oven once stood. John\u2019s sons Ian and Colin took over the business before John\u2019s death in 1964. In his book Bread: The Story of Greggs, Ian Gregg explains that he was inspired by the early-20th-century Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who he came across while studying at Cambridge. Pareto observed that, in Italy in 1905, 20% of the people owned 80% of the land. His rule states that, in any field, 80% of the effect can be achieved with 20% of the effort. Gregg realised that by installing small ovens at the back of the shop and doing most of the heavy baking off site, he could achieve most of the theatre \u2013 the sights and especially smells of the process \u2013 without the hassle of a full-size setup. The brand quickly expanded, assimilating other bakeries along the way. It went public in 1984. In May 1994, it bought the Bakers Dozen chain, doubling its presence overnight. As Greggs grew, it brought its disparate shops together under a single brand \u2013 ditching suffixes such as \u201cof Gosforth\u201d and \u201cthe baker\u201d, but retaining its honest image. Listening to Whiteside\u2019s breezy patter, it is tempting to see Greggs as a microcosm of battles being fought across the country: between green juice and meat pies; global conglomerates and family businesses; London and the north. Greggs\u2019 northern identity is intact: at the Gosforth branch, the menu asks if you want to take your food away or \u201csit in\u201d. \u201cThe culture is very special,\u201d says Whiteside, \u201cand a lot of that comes from the roots in Newcastle.\u201d Newcastle is awash with Greggs, including branches open late into the night, and one protected by a bouncer at weekends. Whiteside says central London is the only place where Greggs has a limited presence: rents are simply too high. \u201cOur average transaction is \u00a32.70,\u201d says Whiteside. \u201cYou need a hell of a lot of customers to make that work where you might be paying \u00a3250,000 a year in rent.\u201d While banks imperil the world economy with risky leveraging, Greggs is debt-free. It contributes widely to local charities and community projects, but still pays an annual dividend to shareholders. Staff are paid above minimum wage, with above-inflation rises and a healthy profit-share scheme \u2013 last year all 20,000 employees received a bonus of \u00a3500. The assistant manager at the Gosforth branch, Susie Brewis, told me she had been with the company for 19 years. When speaking about the profit share and the 50% staff discount card, she practically beamed. Business-wise, the company seems to combine a conservative approach to product with an open-mindedness about new ideas. \u201cWe watch all the food trends,\u201d says Whiteside. \u201cAnd, in time, if some of the things that are gathering pace in London become universally popular then, yes, we\u2019ll consider it.\u201d They recently introduced a katsu curry pasty, which has been selling well, but are waiting to check that sushi is not a flash-in-the-pan fad. \u201cThe other one I constantly joke about is quinoa,\u201d Whiteside adds. \u201cTrendy restaurants have quinoa all over the place, but we don\u2019t think the British public is ready for it yet. We allow these more fashion-led places to go first, and then follow if there is demand.\u201d There is also a high level of regional variation: you won\u2019t see a stottie south of Thirsk. Yet the company has taken risks and failed before. Under one of Whiteside\u2019s predecessors, Greggs tried to launch in Belgium under the brand \u201cEngelse bakker\u201d before retreating in 2008, in what one paper called a \u201cDunkirk moment\u201d. Early attempts at healthier options were slow off the ground. A trial of Greggs Moment, a coffee-shop-style brand with extensive seating, also failed, although its legacy is visible in the shop designs, which are increasingly trendy. In Gosforth, there is plenty of exposed brick, an old delivery bicycle mounted to the wall, and excellent i-fi. The surprising celebrity fans help. In 2002, the actor and model Milla Jovovich, a woman without outward indicators of a doughnut habit, said she would be happy to become the face of Greggs. The actor Thomas Turgoose is a fan, revealing in a 2010 Guardian interview that his girlfriend worked in a branch in Grimsby. Last year, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini launched her own Greggs chocolate bar for charity, and Jake Gyllenhaal said that his favourite pastime in the UK was to sit outside with a Greggs baguette. Even the Observer\u2019s food critic, Jay Rayner, concedes that Greggs is a canny operator. \u201cThey manage to have a very utilitarian high-street presence disguising a rather staunch commitment to a quality product,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have been committed to short supply chains. It\u2019s good stuff, with the caveat that you are talking about massive amounts of carbohydrate.\u201d Obesity is the elephant in the room. All but one of the diners I spoke to couched their love of Greggs in an acknowledgement that it was not the healthiest option, and said that they only stopped by once or twice a week. There are traffic-light labels on all the products, and the company is clear about the calories and fat in its products. But the transparency is only superficial, and the FAQ on the website is full of dead ends. It says that prices vary across branches, but won\u2019t say which is the most expensive or cheapest. (Our investigations team can reveal that on the Seven Sisters Road, Islington, a sausage roll is 90p, 10p more than in Gosforth.) It confirms that the pure palm oil it uses is sustainable, and that it is \u201cworking on\u201d ensuring sustainability across the supply chain \u2013 which invites the question of whether the combined fats it uses might contain the unsustainable variety. And the \u201cfreshly prepared\u201d food that it trumpets is different from being freshly made. Although the bread is finished off in store, it arrives frozen. Assistant manager Brewis told me her life had been made easier by the advent of pre-chopped sandwich fillings and salad ingredients. Another former employee agrees: \u201cThe Mexican chicken sandwiches were a \u2019mare.\u201d In a Guardian piece from 2010, a former employee recounted sprinkling the loaves with powdered egg to help create an even glaze, and loading lettuce \u201cdrowned in chlorine\u201d into sandwiches. Greggs reveals its exact ingredients only on demand. The cheese-and-vegetable pasty recipe its office sends me makes it clear why: there are more than 50 ingredients, of varying familiarity. Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, anyone? While the fondness towards the company from staff and customers alike seems to be unforced and universal, there\u2019s no doubt Greggs is helped by a well-greased PR machine, too. A few years ago, an error on Google caused a spoof Greggs logo to flash up with the overlaid slogan: \u201cProviding shit to scum for over 70 years.\u201d Rather than get angry, Greggs replied with grace and charm, offering Google doughnuts if the problem was fixed. Equally, the pasty-tax fiasco allowed Greggs to position itself as the embattled northern charmers against the evil, cash-sucking Tory government. The proposed tax was not aimed at punishing pasty lovers, but partly at levelling the playing field. Some of Greggs\u2019 competition \u2013 fish and chip shops, for example \u2013 have to pay VAT. It is hard to feel too sorry for Greggs\u2019 new competitors such as Pret a Manger or Eat, but high streets up and down the land are littered with the ghosts of old local bakeries killed by Greggs\u2019 power. \u201cEverybody in the industry is watching Greggs, because nobody can quite believe how well it has done,\u201d says Helen Colley, a food consultant who works on cakes for Nando\u2019s and Costa. \u201cGreggs knows its customer base better than most other retailers, and it adapts to demand. It sticks by its principles, and it makes things you want to go back for. It\u2019s great value, but it doesn\u2019t taste cheap. And it is honest. The packaging is simple, and it doesn\u2019t pretend to be healthy. There aren\u2019t any low-sugar cakes. The presentation says: \u2018This is a great big slice of cake and, if you eat it, you are going to enjoy it.\u2019 \u201cThere are plenty of little artisan bakeries doing sourdough and avocado and things, but no traditional ones. Greggs is completely on its own, forging ahead.\u201d Back at head office, Whiteside is preparing for the next expansion. The rationalisation this week is about creating \u201ccentres of excellence\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for factories specialising in one or two products, rather than making a bit of everything. Greggs\u2019 new focus is on non-high-street sites: hospitals, industrial estates, office parks \u2013 places where there would not have been demand for a bakery, but there might be for baked goods on the go. In 2014, it was reported that the New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, where 70% of the population is obese, had the second-busiest Greggs in the country, which the local NHS trust boss described as \u201cnot ideal\u201d. Choosing a site is as much art as science, says Whiteside. \u201cWe use all the data, of course, but there\u2019s no substitute for boot leather. You really need people who know the area. It can be as simple as being on the right of a crossing, not the left. But anything near a bus stop is good news.\u201d The first Greggs-branded shop in Northern Ireland will open soon in Belfast. Beyond that, Ireland would be the logical next step. Once all of the UK stores are up to scratch, who knows? Will Greggs take pasties (no longer \u201cCornish\u201d, since EU regulation in 2011) to Japan? \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll rush into that market, no,\u201d says Whiteside with a chuckle. \u201cNever say never. But our brand is doing the common uncommonly well. And a big part of our positioning is that we\u2019re market leaders in pasties and sausage rolls. Those are products that only the UK eats.\u201d As ever, it\u2019s hard to look past the sausage rolls. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2016. Belfast was incorrectly placed outside the UK in an earlier version because of an editing error. The article was further amended on 7 March 2016 to correct a percentage miscalculation; 335 jobs out of 20,000 is 1.7%, not 0.26%.",

Really, it ought to be raining, but instead the Greggs sign \u2013 four orange squares on a blue background \u2013 is bathed in sunshine. They say you should write what you know and, at last, my career has brought me to a wall of hot baked goods. I join the back of the lunch queue and ponder my options. As ever, it is hard to look past the sausage rolls. And, as ever, the first bite dispels any suspicions about their precise composition. This rich, golden experience costs 80p.

On Tuesday, it announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/greggs-says-healthier-options-boosted-sales\">a 25% rise in pre-tax profits, to \u00a373m</a>, on sales of \u00a3835.7m. This is no flash in the pan: last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/29/greggs-profits-boosted-by-healthier-options-and-shop-upgrades\">profits for the first six months rose by 51%</a>. The share price rose on the latest announcement. Cuts were announced, too. Three of its 12 main bakeries will be shut, with 335 jobs potentially lost, but the company stressed that this was part of a broader \u00a3100m plan for expansion \u2013 and, at any rate, 1.7% of its roughly 20,000 employees does not seem swingeing. Greggs has 1,698 outlets, more than McDonalds\u2019 or Starbucks, and plans to take this figure beyond 2,000. It shifts more than 2.5m sausage rolls per week, and 1m cups of coffee.</p> <p>The figures were a triumph for CEO Roger Whiteside, a veteran of Ocado and Marks &amp; Spencer, who was hired in 2013 and set about repositioning the bakery as a \u201cfood-on-the-go\u201d brand rather than a \u201ctake-home\u201d bakery. \u201cWe realised we weren\u2019t going to win the battle against the supermarkets for the take-home baked goods,\u201d he tells me. \u201cInstead, we had to deploy our bakery skills to sell our products for instant consumption.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca39457195c2d845fcb1df05b4b35e46f1423014\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca39457195c2d845fcb1df05b4b35e46f1423014/0_0_4242_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A flat white from Greggs costs \u00a31.75, 40p cheaper than Pret a Manger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A flat white from Greggs costs \u00a31.75, 40p cheaper than Pret a Manger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This means sandwiches, soups and salads rather than just loaves and cakes, and a range of healthier options, too. The lower-calorie range now accounts for 10% of sales, and the figure is growing. \u201cEverybody pops into Greggs for something at some point, but often that\u2019s because they\u2019re treating themselves. What we\u2019re saying is: we want to be there for you, for breakfast, lunch and snacking.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Greggs has 1,698 outlets, more than McDonald's or Starbucks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gosforth is the Greggs ground zero. It was just down the road that John Gregg inherited a family yeast-and-eggs business in 1939, delivering baked goods by bicycle before opening the first shop in 1951, on Gosforth High Street. The original store was bought by a travel agency, which remains today \u2013 in a back room, staff showed me the outline of where the Greggs oven once stood. John\u2019s sons Ian and Colin took over the business before John\u2019s death in 1964. In his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bread-Story-Greggs-Ian-Gregg/dp/0552169498\">Bread: The Story of Greggs</a>, Ian Gregg explains that he was inspired by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto\">early-20th-century Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto</a>, who he came across while studying at Cambridge. Pareto observed that, in Italy in 1905, 20% of the people owned 80% of the land. His rule states that, in any field, 80% of the effect can be achieved with 20% of the effort. Gregg realised that by installing small ovens at the back of the shop and doing most of the heavy baking off site, he could achieve most of the theatre \u2013 the sights and especially smells of the process \u2013 without the hassle of a full-size setup. The brand quickly expanded, assimilating other bakeries along the way. It went public in 1984. In May 1994, it bought the Bakers Dozen chain, doubling its presence overnight. As Greggs grew, it brought its disparate shops together under a single brand \u2013 ditching suffixes such as \u201cof Gosforth\u201d and \u201cthe baker\u201d, but retaining its honest image.</p> <p>Listening to Whiteside\u2019s breezy patter, it is tempting to see Greggs as a microcosm of battles being fought across the country: between green juice and meat pies; global conglomerates and family businesses; London and the north. Greggs\u2019 northern identity is intact: at the Gosforth branch, the menu asks if you want to take your food away or \u201csit in\u201d. \u201cThe culture is very special,\u201d says Whiteside, \u201cand a lot of that comes from the roots in Newcastle.\u201d Newcastle is awash with Greggs, including branches open late into the night, and one protected by a bouncer at weekends.</p> <p>Whiteside says central London is the only place where Greggs has a limited presence: rents are simply too high. \u201cOur average transaction is \u00a32.70,\u201d says Whiteside. \u201cYou need a hell of a lot of customers to make that work where you might be paying \u00a3250,000 a year in rent.\u201d While banks imperil the world economy with risky leveraging, Greggs is debt-free. It contributes widely to local charities and community projects, but still pays an annual dividend to shareholders. Staff are paid above minimum wage, with above-inflation rises and a healthy profit-share scheme \u2013 last year all 20,000 employees received a bonus of \u00a3500. The assistant manager at the Gosforth branch, Susie Brewis, told me she had been with the company for 19 years. When speaking about the profit share and the 50% staff discount card, she practically beamed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee41bbad341b0498c03d4af351a214f912517960\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee41bbad341b0498c03d4af351a214f912517960/0_0_4242_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The average transaction at Greggs is \u00a32.70.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The average transaction at Greggs is \u00a32.70.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Business-wise, the company seems to combine a conservative approach to product with an open-mindedness about new ideas. \u201cWe watch all the food trends,\u201d says Whiteside. \u201cAnd, in time, if some of the things that are gathering pace in London become universally popular then, yes, we\u2019ll consider it.\u201d They recently introduced a katsu curry pasty, which has been selling well, but are waiting to check that sushi is not a flash-in-the-pan fad. \u201cThe other one I constantly joke about is quinoa,\u201d Whiteside adds. \u201cTrendy restaurants have quinoa all over the place, but we don\u2019t think the British public is ready for it yet.

      "bodyText": "Seven years ago on Saturday (5 March), the Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.5%. At the time, the cut and plans to pump billions of pounds of electronic money into the economy seemed like an emergency measure to cushion the UK from the global financial crisis. But borrowing costs are still at their record low and amid warnings that a new global slump is around the corner, Bank policymakers show no signs of raising rates any time soon. We look back over seven years of ultra-loose monetary policy: King and colleagues cut rates and launch QE March 2009: The Bank of England cuts interest rates from 1% to 0.5%, the lowest since the central bank was founded in 1694. Policymakers also push the button on a quantitative easing programme \u2013 which will pump tens of billions of pounds of newly created money into Britain\u2019s troubled economy. It is the sixth time that UK borrowing costs have fallen since October 2008, when rates were still 5%. Announcing the cut to 0.5%, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, led by governor Mervyn King, notes a slowdown in the global economy and \u201cpersistent problems in international credit markets\u201d. In the UK , it highlights a drop in economic output at the end of 2008, a rise in unemployment and tight credit conditions for businesses and households. King says it is unlikely that the bank rate could go any lower and policymakers will shift focus to creating money instead. \u201cWe are very close to zero. What we are doing now is switching to injecting money into the economy directly.\u201d May 2009: The Bank of England surprises the City by announcing it is to increase the size of its quantitative easing (QE) operation by \u00a350bn to \u00a3125bn, amid growing concern that the programme announced in March is failing to turn the economy around. It is the first of many increases in QE to come over the years that follow, taking the total to \u00a3375bn. On the same day in May 2009, the European Central Bank (ECB) cuts interest rates to a record low of 1% and says it will follow the Bank of England in launching QE in a bid to pull the eurozone\u2019s stricken economy out of recession. May 2010: A new coalition government is formed by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats after the general election. Bank of England governor Mervyn King gives his strong backing for spending cuts in new chancellor George Osborne\u2019s first budget to come later in the summer. June 2010: George Osborne announces the biggest shakeup in City regulation since 1997 and hands sweeping new powers to the Bank of England designed to prevent a fresh financial crisis. King emerges as the big winner from the chancellor\u2019s shakeup of supervision that will abolish the Financial Services Authority. The Bank is given new tools to prevent bubbles from developing in the financial system, including the right to force banks to hold more capital during boom periods. September 2010: The Bank\u2019s deputy governor Charlie Bean urges Britons to go out and spend to help invigorate the UK\u2019s economic recovery. Rising inflation stokes rate rise bets February 2011: Following a VAT rise and a pick-up in petrol prices, official figures show inflation hit 4% in January \u2013 well above the Bank\u2019s 2% target. Inflation goes up further over following months and peaks at 5.2% in September 2011. City speculation rises that the Bank of England will be forced to raise interest rates within months to curb price pressures. The CBI business group predicts interest rates will begin to rise in the next few months and will end the year at 1.25%. Minutes from the latest monetary policy committee meeting show concerns about inflation are growing there too. Two members voted for a quarter-point rise in interest rates while a third urged a half-point rise. July 2011: The Bank of England\u2019s eurozone counterpart, the European Central Bank, shrugs off the region\u2019s debt crisis and raises interest rates for the second time in 2011 to curb inflation. The move takes the ECB\u2019s benchmark rate to 1.5%. The ECB is forced to start reversing those rises before the year is out amid fears the eurozone crisis could tip economies in the single currrency bloc back into recession. August 2011: Against the background of wild swings on world stock markets, the two hawkish members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee abandon their calls for borrowing costs to rise. Central banks act to stop new credit crunch November 2011: The world\u2019s major central banks pledge concerted emergency measures to underpin fragile eurozone banks and prevent the global financial system from freezing up. After a teleconference chaired by King involving six central banks, they announce \u201ccoordinated central bank action to address pressures in global money markets\u201d. The moves are reminiscent of autumn 2008, when central banks came together to slash interest rates and inject liquidity into financial markets in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. More QE and a new funding for lending scheme July 2012: The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee votes to raise the total amount of quantitative easing to \u00a3375bn, citing signs that the global economy is flagging and having knock-on effects on the UK\u2019s recovery. The move coincided with interest rate cuts in the crisis-hit eurozone and in China. Later the same month, the Bank of England unveils a scheme to boost lending to first-time buyers and small companies in a move that ministers hope will inject fresh funds into the ailing UK economy. The \u201cfunding for lending\u201d scheme is welcomed by the chancellor, George Osborne, who says the launch of the \u00a380bn emergency facility shows Britain is \u201cnot powerless to act\u201d in the face of the eurozone crisis. The scheme offers cut-price loans to banks and building societies, which are expected to make the money available through mortgages to homebuyers and loans to small businesses. But experts warn the new cash may not reach those who need it the most. August 2012: A Bank of England paper concludes that Britain\u2019s richest 5% gained most from quantitative easing. Threadneedle Street said that wealthy families had been the biggest beneficiaries of its \u00a3375bn QE programme but also insists the scheme has helped all sections of the population by sparing the country from a deeper slump. November 2012: The Treasury announces that big cash balances amassed by the Bank of England as a result of its electronic money-creation programme will be used to pay down the national debt by \u00a335bn over the next 18 months. Osborne wants Threadneedle Street to hand over the interest payments it has received on the gilts bought since the start of the QE scheme in early 2009. Mark Carney appointed King\u2019s successor November 2012: George Osborne springs a surprise on the City by announcing Canada\u2019s central bank chief will succeed Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, is the first non-Briton to become Bank of England governor. He is largely unknown outside the cloistered circles of central bankers and financial regulators, but has gained a reputation as a tough operator able to confront leading banks at the heart of the financial crisis. It later emerges that Carney will pocket an annual \u00a3250,000 housing allowance, taking his total pay package to \u00a3874,000 a year when he takes the reins in the summer of 2013. July 2013: Mark Carney takes over from Mervyn King as Bank of England governor. On his first day in the new job, Carney arrives in Threadneedle Street by tube. Carney launches forward guidance August 2013: New Bank of England governor Mark Carney unveils a strategy of \u201cforward guidance\u201d, under which policymakers will not consider raising rates until unemployment declines to 7% (from 7.8%). The Bank\u2019s own forecast puts unemployment above 7% in 2016. The governor says the Bank will only think again about its pro-growth stance if there is a threat of higher inflation or asset bubbles. The scheme is greeted with scepticism in the City. Long-term interest rates, set by investors in financial markets, rise after forward guidance is first announced, amid a slew of upbeat data about house prices, retail spending and business confidence. September 2013: Chancellor George Osborne says he is giving the Bank of England greater powers to prevent the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme causing a property boom. November 2013: Bank governor Mark Carney reins in the mortgage market in a bid to prevent five years of ultra-low interest rates and George Osborne\u2019s help-to-buy scheme from fuelling a housing bubble. Carney announces he is refocusing the funding for lending scheme that gave lenders financial incentives to provide home loans. The focus will now be on business lending, the governor says. February 2014: Just six months after forward guidance was launched the unemployment rate has already dropped below 7% \u2013 two years earlier than the Bank had been expecting. Carney signals, however, that the Bank will keep interest rates at the record low of 0.5% for at least another year and that policymakers \u201cwill not take risks with this recovery\u201d. He also insists \u201cforward guidance is working\u201d. May 2014: Mark Carney warns that the housing market poses the biggest risk to Britain\u2019s economic recovery as a shortage of new homes drives up prices. The \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d warns of rate rise ahead June 2014: Bank of England gets new powers to control the size of mortgages. Carney warns that interest rates are likely to rise before the end of 2014. Later that month, members of parliament\u2019s Treasury select committee accuse the Bank of behaving like an \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d, giving mixed messages on when the first rise in interest rates is likely. September 2014: Carney warns workers they face higher interest rates in the spring of 2015 before they receive rises in real wages. Deflation threat sparks rate cut talk March 2015: With inflation falling closer to zero, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane suggests policymakers may be forced to slash interest rates to zero in the coming months to tackle the threat of deflation. Official figures after Haldane\u2019s remarks show that inflation has dropped to zero for the first time on record in Britain. Inflation was pushed down by a deep oil price slump and a fierce price war being fought out by supermarkets. Inflation, measured on the consumer prices index (CPI), turns negative in April. May 2015: The coalition government is replaced by a Conservative government. The coalition was the first administration in more than half a century to enjoy unchanged borrowing costs for its entire term. In the first announcement from the Bank under the new Conservative government, interest rates are again held at 0.5%. New rate rise hints from Carney July 2015: The BoE governor says an interest rate hike in the UK is \u201cmoving closer\u201d. He tells the Treasury select committee households should start to manage their finances with a future hike in mind and he notes the UK economy has been performing well, that wages are starting to pick up and that employment has seen a big increase. Later that month, Carney suggests the first interest rate rise since the global financial crash could come around the turn of the year. In a speech, he adds that after an extended period of what were expected to be emergency rates, borrowing costs were likely to peak at just over 2% \u2013 half their average historic norm since the Bank was founded in 1694. But minutes from the Bank\u2019s latest rate-setting meeting show concerns among policymakers that slow progress resolving the Greek debt crisis could delay a rate rise. Chinese slowdown fears intensify August 2015: China devalues its yuan currency against the dollar, sending shockwaves through global markets \u2013 already jittery over signs of a worsening slowdown in the country\u2019s economy and wild swings on its stock markets. The currency move dampens talk of interest rate rises in the US and UK given the prospect that cheaper Chinese goods will reduce inflationary pressures in those countries. But Carney says that while a slowdown in China\u2019s economy could push down further on inflation, it does not change, for now, the central bank\u2019s position on when and how it might increase interest rates. September 2015: BoE chief economist Haldane again warns that interest rates may have to be cut further from their record low level as he highlights signs that the global financial crisis is entering a third phase of turmoil. Haldane is speaking a day after the US central bank decided to delay an interest rate rise for the world\u2019s biggest economy. The US rate-setters blamed a more fragile global outlook in remarks that further rattled jittery financial markets. November 2015: The Bank of England is ready to step up controls on the housing market if a prolonged period of record low interest rates risks inflating a property bubble, Carney says. As he signals that interest rates are likely to remain on hold well into 2016, Carney suggested the Bank may have to revert to other measures, such as tighter lending rules, to keep a lid on house prices. February 2016: Carney says policymakers in the UK could cut interest rates to zero if necessary, but would seek to avoid following Sweden, Denmark and the eurozone by setting negative rates to bolster growth and inflation. Responding to questions from MPs on the Treasury select committee, Carney says the world economy has entered a period of low growth and low interest rates and is likely to be prone to financial shocks. March 2016: The UK marks seven years of record low interest rates. New research marking the anniversary claims rock bottom borrowing costs and quantitative have cost savers an estimated \u00a3160bn, but supported strong increases in the prices of property, stocks and bonds. In its analysis, financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown suggests loose monetary policy has \u201cannihilated\u201d returns on cash.",

      "bodyText": "China has cut its growth target for this year to a range of 6.5% to 7%, down from 7%, a further sign that the world\u2019s second-largest economy is slowing. Premier Li Keqiang said in a speech at the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress parliament, attended by 3,000 delegates, that among the \u201cmain development targets\u201d for the nation was \u201cGDP growth 6.5% to 7%\u201d. The goal had been set at \u201cabout 7%\u201d for 2015, but expansion came in at 6.9%, its lowest for a quarter of a century. China\u2019s leaders have traditionally declared the GDP goal at an easily achieved level that was regularly exceeded, and even then the objective is usually approximated to provide room for positive spin just in case. Using a range, rather than a single figure, will widen the target even further. The downwards revision comes after factory output contracted in China during February. China\u2019s economy has slowed steadily as the ruling Communist party tries to replace a model based on trade and investment with self-sustaining growth driven by domestic consumption. China was also targeting consumer inflation of \u201caround 3%\u201d and unemployment \u201cwithin 4.5%\u201d, the text of Li\u2019s speech said. It did not give a specific target for trade, which fell in 2015, only aiming for \u201ca steady rise in import and export volumes\u201d and \u201ca basic balance in international payments\u201d. It also pledged \u201cfurther reductions in the release of major pollutants\u201d. \u201cIn setting a projected growth rate of between 6.5% and 7% we have taken into consideration the need to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and the need to advance structural reform,\u201d said the speech text, distributed to journalists at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. \u201cIt will also help guide market expectations and keep them stable.\u201d Li\u2019s speech pledged that authorities would make much-needed cuts to overcapacity in the steel, coal, and \u201cother industries facing difficulties\u201d. The country\u2019s leaders have sought to reassure jittery global markets in recent weeks with a unified message that authorities still have monetary and fiscal policy tools in their arsenal to keep the economy from further slowdown. The text of the speech projected a government deficit for 2016 of 2.18 trillion yuan, reaching a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3%, which would be the highest since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. A budget report given to parliament after Li\u2019s speech showed China will raise its defence spending by 7.6%, a smaller increase than past years as it seeks a more efficient military. It was the \u201clowest defence budget increase in six years\u201d, the official news agency Xinhua said, adding it came \u201cin the wake of rising economic headwinds and last year\u2019s massive drawdown of service people\u201d.
