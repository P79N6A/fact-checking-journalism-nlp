      "bodyText": "Just a week after the energy sector protested loudly about the potential impact of Ed Miliband's promise to ban power price increases for 20 months, two major suppliers have started to freeze their own prices. EDF Energy has just unveiled a new fixed price tariff of \u00a31,340 per annum that extends out to 2017 while First Utility has promised to keep its variable tariff unchanged at its current level until March of next year. The moves comes despite predictions from some energy experts that many of the big six companies are likely to raise their bills by between 5% and 10% over the coming weeks. Earlier this week LoCo2 Energy, a small supplier and power generator, put up its electricity bills by an average of 9% saying this was necessary to counter a 10% rise in costs since last spring. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, said that rumours of price rises continued but homeowners could take some small comfort from some of these better deals. \"The fact that suppliers are doing battle royal in this part of the market is good news for competition too.

      "bodyText": "The big story tonight remains the US government shutdown - which my US colleagues are live-blogging here. So here's a brief summary to finish with. \u2022 Christine Lagarde has piled pressure on America's politicians to raise the US debt ceiling quickly. The IMF chief said it was \"mission-critical\" to avert the danger of a US default. The country's Treasury Department also weighed in, warning of dire calamity. \u2022 Fears over a possible US default hit shares on Wall Street. There were also signs of investors moving money out of short-term US debt, pushing up bond yields. Encouraging US jobs data was cancelled out by weaker service sector growth. Here's what analysts are saying about the debt ceiling.... \u2022 Europe's private sector has posted its biggest rise in activity in 27 months. Italian firms reported a stronger month, boosting hopes that the country is pulling out of recession. Retail sales also picked up. \u2022 China's service sector performed well in September too, pushing activity to a six-month high. \u2022 In Greece, the head of the Golden Dawn party is being held in custody ahead of the criminal trial into the party, as the clampdown continues to raise fears over the country's political stability. Another GD MP appeared in court, as the party raged against the decision to jail its leader. \u2022 A survey of a Cyprus gas field found smaller reserves than hoped, but the government will still push on with exploiting it. Back tomorrow, hopefully for a more lively day. Goodnight. GW An uninspiring day in Europe's stock markets is over. The FTSE 100 finished up 11 points at 6449, but the other main markets all lost ground. The French CAC shed 0.7%, the German DAX closed 0.37% lower, Spain's IBEX is down 0.7% and the Italian FTSE MIB dropped 0.5%. No boost from today's decent eurozone economic data, while the US debt ceiling deadline gets closer..... The Japonica Partners investment fund, which has a big holding of Greek debt, has been holding a conference call for City analysts to explain why Greece's bonds are actually much better quality than people realise. Here's a screengrab of Bloomberg's news flashes: FT Alphaville's Joseph Cotterill is on the call, and flags up that Japonica was asked whether it's planning to buy Greek state assets with its Greek government bonds. The idea wasn't ruled out.... Those warnings over the US debt ceiling from Christine Lagarde, and from the US Treasury, come as shares fall on Wall Street today. US traders pushed down the Dow Jones industrial average, as they watched Barack Obama lay into the Republicans in a speech in Rockville, Maryland (details in our US liveblog). The Dow Jones industrial average is down 130 points, or 0.8%, with 28 of its 30 members losing ground. It's not all because of the deadlock on Capitol Hill. A monthly survey of the US services sector showed growth was slowing, with the PMI coming in at 54.4 in September, down from 58.6 in August (anything over 50 shows growth). There are already fears that the shutdown will cost jobs and hit growth. United Technologies, which supplies helicopters and jet engines to the U.S. military, has warned that if there's no deal by Monday it might tell 2,000 workers to down tools. Bloomberg has the details. My US colleague Tom McCarthy has launched a new liveblog tracking Day Three of the government shutdown: Government shutdown enters third day after talks fail to break deadlock \u2013 live It includes details of a report from the US Treasury Department which warns that there would be catastrophic consequences if America doesn't raise its debt ceiling on time. It certainly sounds scary: A default would be unprecedented and has the potential to be catastrophic,\" the Treasury reported. \"Credit markets could freeze, the value of the dollar could plummet, U.S. interest rates could skyrocket, the negative spillovers could reverberate around the world, and there might be a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse. Surely they'll get a debt ceiling deal in time, right? Surely.... Heads-up, Alexis Tsipras, head of Greece's Syriza party, is giving a press conference with European Parliament president Martin Schulz. It's being streamed here. The Golden Dawn clampdown has been raised. Schulz said there was \"no place\" for those with Nazi views in a democratic society while Tsipras welcomed the EP's plans for a special session on \"Golden Dawn and right-wing extremism\". Tsipras also slammed the Greek bailout programme, saying: \"One shouldn't be taking new loans to pay off old ones,\" according to AP's Jurgen Baetz. I don't think he's arguing against rolling over sovereign debt.... The IMF are tweeting highlights from the Lagarde speech, where she's warning about the looming debt ceiling: The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, urged America\u2019s warring politicians to settle their differences as she warned that an escalation of the budget row would harm the entire global economy, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Speaking ahead of the Fund\u2019s annual meeting in Washington next week, Lagarde said it was \"mission critical\u201d that Democrats and Republicans raise the US debt ceiling before the October 17 deadline. Financial markets have started to take fright at the prospect that America could go into technical default as a result of the impasse in Washington and the IMF\u2019s managing director said the dispute was a fresh setback for a global economy that would take at least a decade to recover from the deep slump of 2008-09. Lagarde said: I have said many times before that the U.S. needs to \u201cslow down and hurry up\u201d\u2014by that I mean less fiscal adjustment today and more tomorrow. She added that the world\u2019s biggest economy needed to put its finances in order, but favoured back-loaded measures to raise revenues and limit entitlement spending that did not jeopardise short-term growth. Lagarde added: In the midst of this fiscal challenge, the ongoing political uncertainty over the budget and the debt ceiling does not help. The government shutdown is bad enough, but failure to raise the debt ceiling would be far worse, and could very seriously damage not only the US economy, but the entire global economy. So it is \u201cmission-critical\u201d that this be resolved as soon as possible. We'll have the full story online shortly Some early snaps from Christine Lagarde's speech, in which she also warns that America was too eager this year to cut spending and raise taxes: 03-Oct-2013 15:00 - IMF'S LAGARDE SAYS U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH THIS YEAR WILL BE 'TOO LOW,' BELOW 2 PCT, DUE TO TOO MUCH FISCAL TIGHTENING 03-Oct-2013 15:00 - LAGARDE SAYS U.S. GROWTH WILL BE ABOUT 1 PERCENTAGE POINT HIGHER IN 2014 AS FISCAL STRAINS EASE - SPEECH TEXT 03-Oct-2013 15:00 - LAGARDE SAYS U.S. FAILURE TO RAISE DEBT CEILING COULD 'VERY SERIOUSLY' HURT U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMY, CRITICAL TO RESOLVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 03-Oct-2013 15:00 - LAGARDE SAYS MARKET TURBULENCE SINCE MAY OVER PERCEIVED END TO U.S. EASY MONEY POLICIES COULD REDUCE GDP IN MAJOR EMERGING MARKETS BY 0.5 TO 1 PCT Breaking: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, has urged politicians in Washington to act quickly to resolve the government shutdown before the global economy is hurt badly. Speaking in Washington right now, Lagarde is warning that a failure to raise the debt ceiling could \"very seriously hurt\" the US and global economy. It is critical to resolve the crisis soon, she said. More to follow The yield on America's one-month debt has risen to the highest level in 10 months, suggesting investors are getting worried about the looming debt ceiling and selling bonds which mature at the end of October. This has pushed the yield up to 0.129%, from just 0.028% a week ago. That's still a very 'safe' level, of course, but it's a sign that the US budget deadlock is starting to make traders more nervous, with the debt ceiling looming. The cost of insuring US bonds against default is also up: Some reaction to the Cyprus gas drilling results: Cyprus's hopes of receiving a huge windfall from offshore reserves of natural gas received a knock today, after new drilling results found there is less recoverable gas at one field than hoped. The Nicosia government announced the results of exploratory drilling off its coast a few minutes ago. Texas's Noble Energy, which did the drilling in the Cypriot Aphrodite concession, also updated its shareholders. And the news is that Noble Energy has estimated there is 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (or between 3.6trn and 6trn) to be recovered at that particular gas field south of the Mediterranean island. That's a disappointment, as earlier drilling in 2011 indicated there was 7 trillion cubic feet (or between 5trn and 8trn). The Cypriot government is still pushing on with its plans to exploit the reserves, though: Cypriot energy minister Yiorgos Lakkotrypis told reporters: It's important to state from the outset that, despite the lower quantities we announce today compared to those of 2011, the confirmed reserves affirm a particularly important reserve of natural gas. Keith Elliott, Noble Energy\u2019s senior vice president for Eastern Mediterranean, also remained upbeat: Results from the Cyprus A-2 well have confirmed substantial recoverable natural gas resources and high reservoir deliverability. Cyprus has talked about recovering 60 trillion cubit feet of gas from its reserves - although some analysts are skeptical. Separately, there are reports from Cyprus that the country is considering withdrawing from Eurovision as part of its financial plight. Can we come too? Here's a handy graph putting today's US jobs data into some context: The weekly US jobless claims data is out...and it shows a small rise in the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit last week. The initial jobless claims total rose by 1,000 last week to 308,000. That's close to the recent six-year low, and better than expected. The four-week average fell, to 305,000 - which is the lowest since May 2007. That won't include the effect of the US government shutdown (as this data runs to 28 September and the shutdown began at midnight on 1 October). Oil giant BP helped push the FTSE 100 higher this morning, after a US court ruled in its favour in a case about compensation payments following the Deepwater Horizon diasaster. BP share are up 1.5% in London, and are expected to rise a similar amount in New York. Last night, judges ruled that the company should not be forced to pay billions of dollars in compensation to those not directly affected by the environmental damage following the oil rig explosion in which 11 men died. Angela Monaghan explains: The British oil company welcomed a ruling by the US court of appeals which will force a rethink on how compensation claims related to the disaster will be assessed. The supreme court also ordered that payments must be stopped to people who did not suffer \"actual injury traceable to loss\" from the spill until cases have been properly heard and decided through the judicial process. More here: BP welcomes US court of appeal ruling on Gulf of Mexico oil spill payouts Here's the situation in Europe's stock markets this lunchtime: (I was incorrect to say the DAX was closed today for Germany's Unity Holiday -- but given it's down 0.02% it may as well be :) ) Plenty of chatter in the City today about whether America will raise its debt ceiling in time. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research reckons Washington DC will get its act together, before the US crashes into the $16.7bn borrowing limit, probably around 17 October. He writes; After all, would politicians really be so stupid as to go through a process in which the potential unintended consequences could be so harmful, where there is no precedent for their actions and where there is no clear plan of what exactly they are trying to achieve? (Unless it\u2019s to do with military action\u2026). Jenkins adds, though, that the US should be careful about appearing so blas\u00e9 about its priorities: If the US were a company and the shareholders were openly discussing whether or not they should pay their bills or not then I find it hard to believe that the agencies would be taking such a relaxed view of the matter. So, even if the politicians step back from the abyss, unless the debt ceiling dynamic is dealt with we could see a recurrence of current events. I do not know what the unintended consequences will be, but then again nor do the politicians. What I do know is that if I had the major economic and political advantage of having the world\u2019s reserve currency and most wanted debt instrument is that I wouldn\u2019t play around with it. There's talk in Washington of carving out a 'Grand Bargain' (a wide-ranging fiscal program designed to lower America's long-term borrowing needs). That's a tough task, though, especially when the two sides can't agree to reopen the government. Louise Cooper of Cooper City reckons any deal will just be a temporary patch-up job While Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, isn't 100% convinced Washington will manage a deal in time. The fact that US lawmakers are tied in a game of political brinkmanship over a fresh budget leaves traders not feeling too confident that lawmakers will be able to find common ground on raising the debt ceiling. Indeed, failure to do so could see a US default. President Obama warned Wall Street last night that a conservative faction of the Republicans is willing to allow the US to default on its debt, lifting fears in the market that such a scenario could be played out. The euro has risen around 0.2% against the US dollar to $1.360, while Europe's stock markets are pretty calm. Back to Greece, another Golden Dawn MP has arrived in court as the courtroom drama over the last two days continues to reverberate. Michaloliakos' right hand man, Christos Pappas, was also arrested on charges of overseeing a criminal organisation. His hearing was due to start at 1pm local time, or 11am BST. Earlier this week anti-terror units discovered \"a heap\" of Nazi paraphernalia in Pappas's home, including a book titled \"Hitler by my side\". Golden Dawn itself is furious that judges decided to jail its leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, ahead of a trial over charges that the party is a criminal gang. It issued a statement calling the move \"wretched plot\" and blaming it on \"foreign centres.\" From Athens, Helena Smith reports: In a move that has stunned Greeks, Ilias Kasidiaris, the party's spokesman who emerged from court yesterday kicking and shoving journalists, has now used the media to denounce the imprisonment of Michaloliakos. \"The detention of our general secretary is totally unjust, unconstitutional and has been dictated by foreign centres of power,\" he has told reporters gathered outside the court. Yesterday's courtroom drama (and the violence seen outside court afterwards) also gets plenty of coverage in today's newspapers. Reuters flags up: \"The leader's in, the gang's out!\" top-selling daily Ta Nea wrote on its front page. \"It is the state's duty to go to the end: The criminals need to be revealed, they need to be tried, and they need to pay,\" the newspaper said. Kathimerini makes an important point. This is a live criminal trial, Due process needs to be followed. The fact that certain Golden Dawn deputies were released from pretrial custody \u2013 conditionally \u2013 does not in any way represent evidence of their innocence, just as their being remanded to appear before a magistrate had not meant that they were guilty of the crimes being leveled against them. More good news for the European economy: retail sales were much stronger than expected in August. Eurostat reported that retail sales volumes rose by 0.7% in the euro area, and 0.4% across the wider European Union in August. July's data was also revised higher, showing consumers weren't as cautious about spending as first thought. Eurostat's data shows that non-food shopping was strong, rising by 0.6% in the eurozone. That covers items such as computers, clothing and medical products. The data also showed an increase in fuel purchases, suggesting a rise in motor journeys. Spending on \"automotive fuel in specialised stores\" (that's petrol stations to you and me) was up by 0.9% across euro members. Nice result for Spain in the bond markets this morning, suggesting the political tensions in the euro area have eased following yesterday's Italian confidence vote. Spain sold its maximum target of debt in a strong auction, in which borrowing costs hit their lowest level in three years. The auction saw the Spanish treasury shift \u20ac1.18bn of 10-year bonds at a yield (the rate of return on the debt) of 4.269%, a drop on the 4.5% paid last month. The UK's service sector has revival continues, with the strongest quarterly growth in 16 years - driven by the upswing in the housing market. The monthly PMI survey shows that September was another strong month -- with a reading of 60.3, close to August's seven-month high of 60.5 and deep into expansion territory. However, firms dependent on consumer spending aren't doing quite as well as financial firms, it appears.... Reuters handily provides more details: The sector saw jobs growth in September, something mirrored in surveys of manufacturing and construction earlier this week. Over the third quarter as a whole, the index - measuring the change in activity, including income and chargeable hours worked, from the previous month - averaged its highest level since the second quarter of 1997, Markit said. \"Growth is being led by financial services - linked in part to increased housing market activity - and the business sector,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit. \"Consumer-facing services continue to struggle, reflecting the ongoing squeeze on incomes due to weak pay growth and high inflation.\" Around half of firms surveyed in the service sector - which makes up more than three quarters of Britain's output - expected even brisker trade in a year's time, with the outlook index rising to 71.8. Service providers reported that a jump in new business last month placed strain on resources, with backlogs of work rising at the fastest pace in more than 13 years.The workload, along with firms' optimism about future business, led to a solid rise in employment and some pay rises. The eurozone recovery is gathering pace, with its private sector firms reporting the biggest leap in activity since June 2011 last month. Data firm Markit's monthly surveys of companies across the single currency showed a solid rise in activity. New business has picked up, and the rate of job cuts may finally be slowing to a halt. Markit's monthly survey of activity came in at 52.2, up from August's 51.5. Both service sector firms and manufacturers said conditions were better. Here's some key factoids from the report (online here) Ireland: 55.7 2-month low Germany: 53.2 2-month low Italy: 52.8 29-month high France: 50.5 20-month high Spain: 49.6 2-month low The news comes hours after China's service sector output hit a 6-month high. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the eurozone data showed Europe's recovery on track, despite Spain's private firms faltering after a better August. The final PMI confirms the message from the earlier flash reading that the eurozone enjoyed its strongest quarter of expansion for just over two years in the third quarter. With the rate of expansion picking up in September, the survey bodes well for ongoing growth in the final quarter of the year. Growth is being led by Germany, but France has also now returned to growth. Even more encouraging are the upbeat survey data for Ireland and Italy, both of which show signs of returning to robust growth, and Spain has also stabilised, as ongoing weakness in the domestic economy is offset by a strong upturn in exports. But don't get the bunting out yet -- this only suggests a weak recovery. Williamson explains: Growth remains only modest \u2013 the Eurozone PMI is consistent with GDP rising by just 0.2% on the third quarter, and the political instability that has reared up in Italy is a reminder that there remains plenty of scope for recoveries to be derailed. Good news from Italy this morning \u2013 its service sector has burst back into growth for the first time in 28 months. This may suggest the Italian economy has finally stopped shrinking, a new boost a day after prime minister Enrico Letta faced down Silvio Berlusconi's revolt. Data provider Markit says it's a welcome sign that the economic recovery could be underway, with the monthly PMI jumping to 52.7 in September, from 48.8 in August. It's not been over the 50-point mark (which separates contraction from expansion) since May 2011. Here's the key points: \u2022 Business activity lifted by increase in new work \u2022 Job shedding continues, but at slower rate \u2022 Future expectations highest in more than two years Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet is encouraged: Phil Smith, economist at Markit, said the data shows \"the first signs\" of recovery in the Italian economy after some grim months. But without political stability, he warned, it could quickly deteriorate. He explained: Should the data hold up, however, there may also be a return to growth in service sector employment, which showed its slowest fall for 16 months in September. A significant improvement in businesses\u2019 expectations for the year ahead will have no doubt also helped on this front. The data, alongside those for manufacturing, show Italian GDP at least stabilising in Q3 and perhaps even rising slightly for the first time in more than two years. Political stability is key to this forward momentum being sustained into the later stages of the year and beyond. Overnight in Greece, the head of the far-right Golden Dawn party was remanded in custody, hours after three of his MPs were released pending trial. Another MP, Yannis Lagos, was also detained, as was Giorgos Patelis, the head of Golden Dawn's local office in the area west of Athens where hip-hop star Pavlos Fyssas was stabbed two weeks ago.  All the men faces charges of running a criminal gang, which they deny. From Athens, Helena Smith reported: Armed police led Nikos Mihaloliakos away from the courthouse in handcuffs in the early hours of Thursday after testimony lasting more than six hours. His wife and daughter, also party members, and other Golden Dawn MPs, stood outside the building and shouted words of encouragement to him as he was led away. \"The ridiculous little men, they decided to jail the leader,\" said party MP Michalis Arvanitis. Golden Dawn leader jailed pending trial after Athens hearing Just in - Spain's service sector suffered a drop in activity in last month. Its PMI index has fallen into contraction territory again -- at 49.0 in September, down from 50.4 (showing slight growth) in August. Markit, which compiles the PMI data, also reported that new order growth slowed. On the upside, optimism hit a 41-month high. Spain's government ministers have been boldly declaring that the recession is over. This data doesn't suggest much of a recovery yet. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, commented: The Spanish service sector failed to show much sign of a recovery during September as activity fell back in response to weaker new order growth which itself had been supported by further sharp discounting. One bright spot from the latest survey was that companies were at their most optimistic about the future for nearly three-and-a-half years, suggesting that Spanish service providers are seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. Shares are edging a little higher in early trading -- suggesting China's strong service sector data is trumping US deadlock woes. Here's the early prices : (German's DAX is closed for a public holiday) FTSE 100: up 20 points at 6458, + 0.3% French CAC: up 7 points at 4,165, + 0.18% Italian FTSE MIB: up 98 points at 18,191, +0.5% Spanish IBEX: up 21 points at 9,371, +0.23% Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, reckons there's some \"cautious optimism\" in the City this morning, despite the lack of progress in Washington DC. He argues that, with America on track to smash into its debt ceiling on 17 October, there's little chance of the Federal Reserve turning down its bond-buying stimulus programme soon: Sentiment is still not quite ignoring, but nor is it pricing in the worst case scenario -- which is no agreement until debt ceiling deadline, and possible sovereign default. The possible assumption is that default won\u2019t be allowed, but the longer the budget takes to sort out, the longer the Fed is held off from tapering. Happy days for easy money policy lovers and risk appetite. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says traders will be hoping for encouraging data from Europe's service sector this morning: As we enter the third day of the shutdown of the US government the various positions seem as inextricably entrenched as ever. On the plus side at least we don\u2019t have to worry about the soap opera playing out in Italy as Silvio Berlusconi negotiated what could be politely called a tactical withdrawal and agreed to support Enrico Letta\u2019s government after it became apparent he didn\u2019t have his party\u2019s support with respect to the confidence vote. While he may have run into a brick wall on this occasion Berlusconi has never lacked the capacity to surprise, so I would doubt that we have heard the last of him in this regard. In any case while the political uncertainty in Italy may have subsided for now it still remains quite likely that any type of reform is still set to remain slow and problematic. As for the rest of Europe\u2019s markets while the FTSE may get a slight boost from a positive China services PMI, they continue to have one eye on events in the US, finishing lower yesterday along with US markets, though after yesterday\u2019s non event of an ECB press conference, todays focus is on the latest services PMI data for September for Italy, Spain, France and Germany. All are expected to show positive readings above 50, with the exception of Italy, which is expected to come in at 49.2, raising expectations of a continued recovery. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Looks like a mixed day ahead . Growing concern over the US government shutdown have taken the shine of some encouraging Chines economic data earlier today. While in Europe, Italy is waking up to front pages dominated by Silvio Berlusconi's humiliating defeat in the Senate yesterday, where prime minister Enrico Letta swept home in his confidence vote. More on this shortly. First the good news -- growth in China's service sector has surged to a six month high. Activity jumped to 55.4 in September, from 53.9 in August, as measured by the official Purchasing Managers Index (anything over 50 points = growth). That suggests that Beijing's efforts to pep up the Chinese economy is bearing fruit this autumn. Craig Erlam, analyst at Alpari, explained: This is just another sign that the government's targeted stimulus efforts, which were announced a few months ago in order to combat the slowing growth in the economy and achieve its minimum 7% growth target, are having the desired effect on the economy. That might normally give stock markets a boost, especially with more service sector data due from the eurozone and UK this morning. But now the bad news -- Wednesday was another day of deadlock in Washington, despite US bank chiefs urging politicians on Capitol Hill to get a grip before it's too late. Obama meets bank chiefs as economists warn of 'deep and dark recession' So it's probably going to be a nervy day in the markets....",

Analyst Alastair Johnston said much of Tesco's troubles were now priced into the shares:</p> <blockquote> There were very few points of light in Tesco's first half results. Like for like sales were poor. Trading profit was down. Cash from operations was up including working capital but down (quite heavily) excluding that factor and the fact the base included a lumpy \u00a3180m payment into the pension fund. Despite having refreshed 30% of the UK store estate, momentum is still absent. A genuine push on pricing in Central Europe has caused earnings to fall to a very low level. <br> So why upgrade now? Simply stated, we fail to see much misperception about the company today. For sure, we would consider market consensus earnings expectations to be too high. Our earnings per share [forecast] for 2014 is 10% below consensus and for 2015 15% below. But perhaps the low rating of the stock indicates the market's skepticism about the likelihood these numbers will be attained. Look at the reaction to the first half numbers themselves: Tesco 'missed' consensus by 6-7% but the share price has not budged relative to the market. Something is priced in.  Tesco's operating data remains grim. We do not expect any medium-term pick up. The big change is that these facts seem well established. Most investors are fully cognizant of the operational challenges facing the group we think. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> edged up 11.54 points to 6449.04 despite an opening tumble on Wall Street. Markets are still concerned about the US government shutdown and the country's debt ceiling, while there were mixed signals on the economic front. Service sector surveys from Europe and the UK were generally positive, but the US figures came in below expectations. Ronnie Chopra, head of strategy at Tradenext, said:</p> <blockquote> President Obama said [on Wednesday] after the Dow closed that Wall Street has so far not reacted to the US government shutdown and the deadline of October 17 but today Wall Street seems to have listened. <br> </blockquote> <p>Mining shares lost ground as base and precious metal prices fell. <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> lost 31p to \u00a310.59, <strong>Fresnillo</strong> fell 25p to 910p and <strong>Anglo American</strong> dropped 30p to 1472.5p.</p> <p>Mike Ashley's <strong>Sports Direct International</strong> was 10.5p lower at 698p after two senior directors cashed in \u00a313m worth of shares.</p> <p>Chief executive Dave Forsey and finance director Bob Mellors each exercised bonus scheme options to acquire 1m shares each, and immediately sold 950,000 each at 680p a share. They each raised almost \u00a36.5m, leaving them with just the 50,000 remaining as their stake in the company.</p> <p>Heading the risers in the leading index was <strong>Unilever</strong>, up 48p to \u00a323.67 after a buy note from Investec after recent falls in the wake of a warning about a slowdown in emerging markets. Analyst Martin Deboo said:</p> <blockquote> A third quarter warning has sent a shiver through the shares. But indicated growth is only slightly below our numbers and our core forecast scarcely changes at constant foreign exchange. The project to build an emerging market-led home and personal care business remains in place and Unilever report that they continue to outperform their markets.

      "bodyText": "Investors were checking out of Tesco shares following Wednesday's disappointing half year figures. But on Thursday the company recovered 7p to 365p despite a number of broker downgrades, with more attention paid to a Citigroup note which actually raised its rating from sell to neutral and its price target from 285p to 350p. Analyst Alastair Johnston said much of Tesco's troubles were now priced into the shares: There were very few points of light in Tesco's first half results. Like for like sales were poor. Trading profit was down. Cash from operations was up including working capital but down (quite heavily) excluding that factor and the fact the base included a lumpy \u00a3180m payment into the pension fund. Despite having refreshed 30% of the UK store estate, momentum is still absent. A genuine push on pricing in Central Europe has caused earnings to fall to a very low level. So why upgrade now? Simply stated, we fail to see much misperception about the company today. For sure, we would consider market consensus earnings expectations to be too high. Our earnings per share [forecast] for 2014 is 10% below consensus and for 2015 15% below. But perhaps the low rating of the stock indicates the market's skepticism about the likelihood these numbers will be attained. Look at the reaction to the first half numbers themselves: Tesco 'missed' consensus by 6-7% but the share price has not budged relative to the market. Something is priced in. Tesco's operating data remains grim. We do not expect any medium-term pick up. The big change is that these facts seem well established. Most investors are fully cognizant of the operational challenges facing the group we think. Overall the FTSE 100 edged up 11.54 points to 6449.04 despite an opening tumble on Wall Street. Markets are still concerned about the US government shutdown and the country's debt ceiling, while there were mixed signals on the economic front. Service sector surveys from Europe and the UK were generally positive, but the US figures came in below expectations. Ronnie Chopra, head of strategy at Tradenext, said: President Obama said [on Wednesday] after the Dow closed that Wall Street has so far not reacted to the US government shutdown and the deadline of October 17 but today Wall Street seems to have listened. Mining shares lost ground as base and precious metal prices fell. Vedanta Resources lost 31p to \u00a310.59, Fresnillo fell 25p to 910p and Anglo American dropped 30p to 1472.5p. Mike Ashley's Sports Direct International was 10.5p lower at 698p after two senior directors cashed in \u00a313m worth of shares. Chief executive Dave Forsey and finance director Bob Mellors each exercised bonus scheme options to acquire 1m shares each, and immediately sold 950,000 each at 680p a share. They each raised almost \u00a36.5m, leaving them with just the 50,000 remaining as their stake in the company. Heading the risers in the leading index was Unilever, up 48p to \u00a323.67 after a buy note from Investec after recent falls in the wake of a warning about a slowdown in emerging markets. Analyst Martin Deboo said: A third quarter warning has sent a shiver through the shares. But indicated growth is only slightly below our numbers and our core forecast scarcely changes at constant foreign exchange. The project to build an emerging market-led home and personal care business remains in place and Unilever report that they continue to outperform their markets. And surely there will now be an even sharper spur for the radical action on the portfolio that we have been advocating. Others might see black clouds, but we choose to focus on the silver linings\u2026and a portal of opportunity back into the story. Vodafone added 3.05p to 222p. The mobile phone company announced chief financial officer Andy Halford would leave the group next year after the completion of its $130bn deal to sell its US wireless business to joint venture partner Verizon. He will be replaced by Nick Read, chief executive of its Africa, Middle East and Asia-Pacific businesses. Aviva added 5.6p to 413.1p following news its US disposal has raised more than initially announced. The insurer said after the UK market closed on Wednesday that it had sold its US life and annuities business to Athene Holding for $2.6bn (\u00a31.7bn), more than the $1.8bn expected last December. The cash proceeds to Aviva are $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn) after the repayment of an external loan for the US business. Elsewhere BP was 4.85p better at 437.15p after it won a victory in its US battle to limit payouts over its 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. William Hill finished 1.7p higher at 413p, shrugging off news of a slowdown in business at its betting shops and football results going against the bookmaker. The company's unexpected trading update showed similar themes to Ladbrokes, albeit without the continuing problems the latter faces in its digital business: July's heatwave kept punters away from its shops while when they returned, they were winning their football bets. Ladbrokes had said there were 35% fewer draws - which are favourable to bookies - in the Premier League so far this year. All this meant third quarter operating profits at William Hill were \u00a320m lower than its expectations, Lower down the market Falklands Oil and Gas fell 0.75p to 27.75p after it agreed a \u00a361m all share deal to buy smaller rival Desire Petroleum, giving it access to the north of the islands where oil has been discovered at the Sea Lion prospect. FOG's licences are all in the south of the island were oil has yet to be found. Desire jumped 4p to 16.25p.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in New York fell sharply on Thursday after the US Treasury warned that the budget fight between Republicans and Democrats in Washington risked plunging the world's biggest economy into its worst slump since the Great Depression. President Barack Obama turned up the pressure on Republicans on Capitol Hill after the Treasury and the International Monetary Fund joined senior Wall Street figures in urging a deal well ahead of the deadline for raising America's debt ceiling on 17 October. \"A default would be unprecedented and has the potential to be catastrophic,\" the Treasury reported. \"Credit markets could freeze, the value of the dollar could plummet, US interest rates could skyrocket, the negative spillovers could reverberate around the world, and there might be a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse.\" The recession of five years ago was the most severe the US has suffered and the economy has recovered only slowly from the damage caused by the financial crash. A health check of the service sector showed a marked slowdown in activity even before large parts of the federal government were shut down as a result of the failure to agree a budget deal. Obama accused the Tea Party wing of the Republicans of being \"extremists\" who were \"demanding a ransom for doing their jobs\". The president added: \"Congress has to pass a budget that funds our government with no partisan strings attached.\" Heightened anxiety in the financial markets was reflected in an early 170 point fall in the Dow Jones industrial average and a rise in interest rates for one-month US Treasury bonds. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, urged America's politicians to settle their differences before the dispute harmed the entire global economy. Speaking ahead of the fund's annual meeting in Washington next week, Lagarde said it was \"mission critical\" that Democrats and Republicans raise the US debt ceiling before the 17 October deadline. Lagarde said the dispute was a fresh setback for a global economy that would take at least a decade to recover from the slump of 2008-09. \"I have said many times before that the US needs to \"slow down and hurry up\" \u2013 by that I mean less fiscal adjustment today and more tomorrow,\" Lagarde said. She added that the world's biggest economy needed to put its finances in order, but favoured back-loaded measures to raise revenues and limit entitlement spending such as medicare that did not jeopardise short-term growth. \"In the midst of this fiscal challenge, the ongoing political uncertainty over the budget and the debt ceiling does not help. The government shutdown is bad enough, but failure to raise the debt ceiling would be far worse, and could very seriously damage not only the US economy, but the entire global economy. \"So it is 'mission-critical' that this be resolved as soon as possible.\" Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has also warned of the risks from a protracted federal shutdown. Lagarde's speech followed an appeal by senior figures on Wall Street for a budget to be passed in Washington. The IMF managing director said America's recovery was being held back by over-hasty budget cuts. \"Households are in better shape, the housing sector is looking brighter, and the private sector engine is humming again. And yet, growth this year will still be too low \u2013 below 2% \u2013 due to too much fiscal adjustment. This should ease up next year, with growth about a percentage point higher.\" Lagarde said: \"We at the IMF are very familiar with the ebb and flow of economic cycles, with the shift from recession to recovery. Experience tells us that this process usually takes a year or two, or a bit longer if the situation is especially severe. The transitions I am talking about today are different. They will likely play out over the rest of the decade, if not longer.\"",

      "bodyText": "A long awaited consolidation among those companies exploring - contentiously - for oil in the Falkland Islands is underway. Falklands Oil and Gas has agreed a \u00a361m all share deal to buy smaller rival Desire Petroleum, giving it access to the north of the islands where oil has been discovered at the Sea Lion prospect. FOG's licences are all in the south of the island were oil has yet to be found. The deal will give the combined company - 60% owned by FOGL shareholders, 40% by Desire's investors - five exploration wells and \u00a3170m in cash. Desire had been looking for investment to fund further exploration. In a separate agreement the new company has agreed to farm out two licences to Premier Oil and Rockhopper. The activities in the area have aroused the ire of the Argentinian government and rekindled the row over the islands' sovereignty. So far this has not discouraged the oil explorers. News of the deal sent shares in Desire more than 30% higher to 16p, while FOGL has fallen 5% to 27p. Rockhopper meanwhile is up 5p at 133p and Premier Oil has slipped 0.3p to 331.8p.

National output increased by 0.7% in the second quarter and looks to have beaten that in the three months to September. The most pessimistic City forecast is for third-quarter output to be up 0.8% but there are some analysts who think it could be as high as 1.3%. The Office for National Statistics will have its first stab at estimating third-quarter GDP later this month but clearly there has been a marked acceleration since the start of the year. This week's reports on manufacturing, construction and now services suggest that the outlook for the rest of 2013 and beyond is for strong growth to continue. George Osborne might be keeping a wary eye on developments in the US but it would take a debt default rather than a temporary government shutdown to knock the UK economy off course now. Indeed, a more pertinent question is whether Britain has achieved what Mark Carney calls \"escape velocity\". Not quite, says the governor of the Bank of England. In normal times, the economy grows by around 2.5% a year and on that basis would be getting on for 15% bigger than it was when the recession began in early 2008. In reality, it is 3% smaller, which means there is plenty of unused capacity that can be used up before inflationary problems start to appear. Carney believes that policy can be left nice and loose for the time being. The Bank's reluctance to tighten policy at least until unemployment has come down to 7% means economic policy will remain highly stimulative. Consensus growth forecasts for 2014 are far too low and will be revised up. Growth of 3.5% in 2014 looks entirely plausible. Stronger expansion should be accompanied by rising real incomes. Inflation is on course to dip below 2% early next year and an increased demand for labour will lead to higher wages. The improvement in living standards will be small and it won't be enough to offset the real wage cuts seen in the rest of this parliament but it will allow ministers to say that a corner has been turned. As things stand, though, this will be a short boomlet rather than the sort of steady, sustained recovery the economy needs. Why? Because rising demand is the result of rising spending rather than investment. Because consumers are funding their spending by running down their savings. And because it is all too easy to envisage what two or three more quarters of strong growth will do to a bubble-prone housing market.

      "body": "<p>On 15 September, business leaders from Bridgeport, Connecticut \u2013 a down-at-heel port town on Long Island Sound - gathered just outside town in the <a href=\"http://friendshipstratford.org/aboutus.htm\">Friendship Baptist Church</a> to pray for divine intervention in a matter of business.</p> <p>The Reverend Johnny Gamble led the congregants in prayer for the 15 people who lost their jobs when the Community Bank of Bridgeport failed two days earlier. The Community Bank, chartered in 2001 as the only minority-owned bank in Connecticut, had lent Gamble enough money to found his church. It had made loans to the churchgoers and employed their children. </p> <p>The closing still stings Peter F Hurst, who was president of the failed bank, and who says he has been trying hard to find jobs for his former employees. \"We did more than just lending,\" Hurst says. \"We created jobs. We gave the community a sense of hope.\"</p> <p>Below the category of megabanks known as \"too big to fail\" there is a second class of banks deeply embedded within many American communities. Hurst calls these \"too small to survive\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"You have all the big banks and they have got all kind of government assistance. And our bank is too small to survive. Small banks don't get any help. And they get regulated just like the big banks, which doesn't make sense.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hurst fought for about three and a half years to keep his bank open, until the Community Bank was closed by regulators on 13 September. He applied for a bailout from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp) in late 2008, but was rejected in a short, formal phone call from someone from the FDIC. </p> <p>His choice of buyers were not favored by the regulators. As a result, the Community Bank was the only bank to truly fail in 2013, despite the persistent efforts of regulators, potential buyers, the congregation's prayers and Hurst himself. By the time the bank was forced to close, it only had $27m in assets and needed $2.3m in capital, which never materialized, to stay alive. Its closure <a href=\"http://www.tribtown.com/view/story/e947a8725099408e8b311ea0326f5889/CT--Bank-Closures-Connecticut\">cost the FDIC $7.8m</a>.</p> <p>Hurst's battle to save his bank, while unique and often strange, led him down risky paths and illuminates how hard survival is for the thousands of small banks in the US that don't have billion-dollar balance sheets, powerful shareholders or well-connected lobbyists. They don't have consultants to tell them how they should change their businesses to make money.</p> <p>The FDIC, which is responsible for insuring bank accounts, has shut down 489 of these banks since 2008, auctioning most off and letting only 26 vanish when buyers don't emerge. Those 26, including Hurst's bank, closed for good, with the FDIC picking up the bill. It's all part of the necessary cleanup after the financial crisis, but, as big banks dominate the landscape, it's also a part of the financial system that most people don't see unless it happens in their own communities.</p> <p>For the Community Bank, the trouble started in the March of 2010, when the FDIC noticed the bank's performance was below its standards and issued Hurst <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/enforcement/2010-02-10.pdf\">a set of instructions</a> describing what he had to do to stay in business.</p> <p>The FDIC said the Community Bank would have to do two things: get rid of many of its loans, and keep more money around to absorb potential losses.</p> <p>The Community Bank had concentrated its efforts in making real estate loans to local businesses. This was a risky proposition that depended on the good will of gentrifiers, who are famously fickle. Once a prosperous port town, Bridgeport's glory days often seem far in the past. Despite its location in affluent Fairfield County, Bridgeport's citizenry are not as well off as their neighbors. The town had a per capita income of just $18,354 in 2011, a fraction of the $90,700 per capita income of nearby Westport.</p> <p>For Hurst, making real estate loans to businesses was his plan to save his bank after the financial crisis. The FDIC, looking at the Community Bank's books and millions of dollars in potential losses, did not share his faith in this strategy.</p> <p>He still believes that having to reduce his bank's commercial estate loans, as ordered by FDIC, ultimately hurt the bank. \"By shrinking those loans, we were shrinking our earning power,\" Hurst says.</p> <p>His bank's fate came down to the long and unsuccessful attempt to find a buyer who wanted to have a branch in Bridgeport and potentially accept millions of dollars in losses. Over the years, Hurst says he approached number of investors of high net worth and close to 20 banks.

      "bodyText": "On 15 September, business leaders from Bridgeport, Connecticut \u2013 a down-at-heel port town on Long Island Sound - gathered just outside town in the Friendship Baptist Church to pray for divine intervention in a matter of business. The Reverend Johnny Gamble led the congregants in prayer for the 15 people who lost their jobs when the Community Bank of Bridgeport failed two days earlier. The Community Bank, chartered in 2001 as the only minority-owned bank in Connecticut, had lent Gamble enough money to found his church. It had made loans to the churchgoers and employed their children. The closing still stings Peter F Hurst, who was president of the failed bank, and who says he has been trying hard to find jobs for his former employees. \"We did more than just lending,\" Hurst says. \"We created jobs. We gave the community a sense of hope.\" Below the category of megabanks known as \"too big to fail\" there is a second class of banks deeply embedded within many American communities. Hurst calls these \"too small to survive\". \"You have all the big banks and they have got all kind of government assistance. And our bank is too small to survive. Small banks don't get any help. And they get regulated just like the big banks, which doesn't make sense.\" Hurst fought for about three and a half years to keep his bank open, until the Community Bank was closed by regulators on 13 September. He applied for a bailout from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp) in late 2008, but was rejected in a short, formal phone call from someone from the FDIC. His choice of buyers were not favored by the regulators. As a result, the Community Bank was the only bank to truly fail in 2013, despite the persistent efforts of regulators, potential buyers, the congregation's prayers and Hurst himself. By the time the bank was forced to close, it only had $27m in assets and needed $2.3m in capital, which never materialized, to stay alive. Its closure cost the FDIC $7.8m. Hurst's battle to save his bank, while unique and often strange, led him down risky paths and illuminates how hard survival is for the thousands of small banks in the US that don't have billion-dollar balance sheets, powerful shareholders or well-connected lobbyists. They don't have consultants to tell them how they should change their businesses to make money. The FDIC, which is responsible for insuring bank accounts, has shut down 489 of these banks since 2008, auctioning most off and letting only 26 vanish when buyers don't emerge. Those 26, including Hurst's bank, closed for good, with the FDIC picking up the bill. It's all part of the necessary cleanup after the financial crisis, but, as big banks dominate the landscape, it's also a part of the financial system that most people don't see unless it happens in their own communities. For the Community Bank, the trouble started in the March of 2010, when the FDIC noticed the bank's performance was below its standards and issued Hurst a set of instructions describing what he had to do to stay in business. The FDIC said the Community Bank would have to do two things: get rid of many of its loans, and keep more money around to absorb potential losses. The Community Bank had concentrated its efforts in making real estate loans to local businesses. This was a risky proposition that depended on the good will of gentrifiers, who are famously fickle. Once a prosperous port town, Bridgeport's glory days often seem far in the past. Despite its location in affluent Fairfield County, Bridgeport's citizenry are not as well off as their neighbors. The town had a per capita income of just $18,354 in 2011, a fraction of the $90,700 per capita income of nearby Westport. For Hurst, making real estate loans to businesses was his plan to save his bank after the financial crisis. The FDIC, looking at the Community Bank's books and millions of dollars in potential losses, did not share his faith in this strategy. He still believes that having to reduce his bank's commercial estate loans, as ordered by FDIC, ultimately hurt the bank. \"By shrinking those loans, we were shrinking our earning power,\" Hurst says. His bank's fate came down to the long and unsuccessful attempt to find a buyer who wanted to have a branch in Bridgeport and potentially accept millions of dollars in losses. Over the years, Hurst says he approached number of investors of high net worth and close to 20 banks. The FDIC reached out to a reliable list of about 500 financial institutions who usually have an appetite to take on small, troubled banks. Connecticut's state banking regulator also searched for buyers. None of them bit. Hurst's final option, arranged by a banking consultant acting as matchmaker, ended the Community Bank's days on a strange and hostile note. Donald Vaccaro, the co-founder of the ticket-reselling company the Ticket Network, was Hurst's choice. In 2012, Vaccaro noted his interest in investing in Bridgeport real estate. A banking consultant connected Hurst and Vaccaro, and, after some negotiations, Vaccaro agreed to invest $5m in the bank to make it \"the best capitalized bank in the state of Connecticut,\" Vaccaro says. Vaccaro saw himself not just as investor, but as one who would mete out a form of capitalist justice. He saw Hurst's battle as the classic David versus Goliath tale \u2013 where Goliath was not just big banks, but also regulators who, in his opinion, favor those big banks. Vaccaro believes banks like the Community have \"inherent value\". Vaccaro's ideals, however noble, paled next to a recent history that made regulators nervous. In 2012, he lost out on a crucial state contract because he got drunk and offended several high-ranking Connecticut officials, including the state's governor, at an Oscars party. Witnesses alleged that Vaccaro leveled a racial slur at a bouncer; Vaccaro denies that he did. Hurst, however, still believed in Vaccaro. So did the local branch of the NAACP, which, after meeting with Vaccaro, said he \"was trying to do the right thing,\" and supported his bid to invest in The Community Bank.

      "bodyText": "FirstGroup will pay \u00a332.5m in premiums to run the Great Western route for two more years \u2013 despite having earlier walked away from a contract to run the line until 2015 to avoid payments of up to \u00a3800m to the government. The government hailed the new franchise agreement, which has been reached days an extension to its current franchise was due to expire on 12 October, as \"part of the continued successful rollout of the new rail franchising schedule\". The contract, a 23-month franchise to run commuter and long-distance services from London Paddington, also commits First to \u00a3150m of works annually, which include building a new Reading rail depot and bearing some of the cost of implementing the new Inter City Express trains on the line. While the state-owned Directly Operated Railways has been theoretically on standby, First was effectively able to negotiate terms as the sole bidder as the government handed out direct awards to incumbent train operators in the wake of the west coast mainline franchising fiasco. First will negotiate a further 10-month contract before a long-term franchise is let in July 2016.

      "bodyText": "Britain's economy may have expanded at its fastest pace in 15 years over the past three months, analysts suggested on Thursday, after an upbeat survey of the key services sector suggested it is growing at a healthy clip. The monthly Purchasing Managers' Index for services declined slightly, to 60.3 in September, from 60.5 in August, but the average score over the quarter suggested the fastest growth in services output since mid-1997. Chris Williamson, chief economist of data provider Markit, which compiles the survey, said taken together with similarly strong readings for activity in the much smaller construction and manufacturing sectors, this latest survey signals even stronger growth in GDP than the 0.7% recorded between April and June. \"Historical comparisons of the PMI with official GDP data suggest that the economy grew by 1.2% in the three months to September. This was a marked gathering in the rate of expansion compared with the 0.7% increase seen in the second quarter.\" Michael Tinsley, of BNP Paribas, added that in the second quarter of 1997, the last time the combined PMI surveys were this strong, GDP growth was 1.2% \u2013 well above Britain's long-term average \u2013 and averaged 1% every quarter over the following year. \"It remains to be seen whether the UK can repeat anything like that feat, and we would prudently expect some cooling in the data in coming quarters. But for now there is no mistake the economy is growing jolly fast,\" he said. Firms reported that incoming new business had continued to be strong, they were hiring new staff, and expectations of future activity were also positive \u2013 a marked turnaround from the start of 2013, when many economists feared that the UK may have dipped into a renewed recession. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, described the latest survey as \"very good news\" \u2013 though he warned that it could force the Bank of England to take earlier action on interest rates than it currently expects. Under new governor Mark Carney's policy of \"forward guidance\", the Bank's monetary policy committee has pledged not to raise interest rates until the unemployment rate falls at least to 7%, provided inflation does not get out of control. The committee expects that not to happen for up to three years. But many City analysts are betting that borrowing costs will have to rise sooner, as the economic recovery gathers pace. The first estimate of GDP growth for the third quarter of 2013 will be published later this month. Earlier on Thursday, PMI surveys for the euro area suggested that the 17-member zone continued to clamber out of recession in the third quarter. The services index jumped to a 27-month high of 52.2 \u2013 above the 50 mark that divides expansion from contraction. German activity expanded for the fourth successive month; while the French survey suggested the country's services sector scored its first expansion in more than a year. The eurozone economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of the year, marking the end of a gruelling 18-month downturn; but several member-countries, including Spain and Italy, and bailed-out Greece and Cyprus, remain in recession.",

      "bodyText": "EasyJet raised its profit expectations for the full year after it attracted more business and leisure passengers and enjoyed a strong summer. The budget airline said in a trading update that pre-tax profit for the 12 months to 30 September is expected to have increased by at least 48% to between \u00a3470m and \u00a3480m. This compared with an earlier guidance in July of profit between \u00a3450m and \u00a3480m, and would be a sharp improvement on the \u00a3317m achieved in the previous year. It is also above analysts' forecasts of \u00a3465m profit. Revenue per seat is expected to rise by around 6% in the full year after strong demand in July and August and despite the political unrest in Egypt. The update came as the UK's Civil Aviation Authority said it was satisfied with plans submitted by Gatwick airport to raise average charges by 0.5% above retail price inflation for seven years. EasyJet's chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said she was \"disappointed\" with the increase. \"This is based on the airport's proposals and ignores those of the airlines who gave evidence to support a lowering in charges which would have led to a reduction in fares paid by passengers.\" Luton-based EasyJet has increased efforts to attract business users, now 18% of passengers, with the introduction of allocated seating, flexible tickets and more frequent flights on key routes. Total passenger numbers increased by 4% to 60.7 million over the airline's financial year. \"EasyJet has delivered a strong performance in the last 12 months due to management action to generate value to our customers and maintain a tight control of costs combined with an unusually benign capacity environment,\" McCall. EasyJet said its fuel bill in the first six months of the 2014 financial year was likely to be between \u00a320m and \u00a330m higher than the same period a year earlier.",

      "bodyText": "While Tesco has problems in almost every part of its empire, rival Sainsbury's unveiled a step up in sales growth over the summer. The UK's third largest supermarket said underlying sales \u2013 which exclude benefits from new store space \u2013 were up 2%, excluding fuel, in the 16 weeks to 28 September, as it successfully fought off competition from discounters and larger rivals Tesco and Asda. Enjoying his moment of glory over rival Tesco, chief executive Justin King said that Sainsbury's was out-performing the market because of \"great standards of service and availability in stores\" and its investment in high-quality own-label products. He conceded that virtually all of the supermarket's shoppers were likely to visit discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, which have been enjoying rapid growth in the past few years. But he said that some of Sainsbury's best-performing stores were situated close to Aldi outlets as the supermarket was able to offer prices that were \"pretty sharp\" on the same quality of goods. The retailer's in-house brands such as Taste the Difference and By Sainsbury's grew at twice the rate of third-party brands as shoppers looked to save money. Clothing sales were also strong, growing at twice the pace of food. Sales growth at convenience stores stepped up from 15% to 20%, which King attributed to the warm summer weather. However, online sales growth slipped back from 20% to 15% and King suggested that shoppers had preferred to be out in the sunshine rather than waiting at home for deliveries. Sainsbury's position in the fast-growing online and convenience-store sector as well as its emphasis on quality \u2013 which kept it out of the horse-meat scandal \u2013 has ensured that the chain is the only one of the UK's \"big four\" grocers to increase market share in the past year. Looking forward, King said he was encouraged by signs of economic recovery, but added: \"The reality is household budgets are under pressure. Inflation is 3% and wage rises are barely 1%. \"We know by listening to customers that they continue to find challenges in their weekly budget, and shopping habits they developed in the downturn are likely to persist.\" In that environment, Sainsbury's is expecting shoppers to switch to own-label and enjoy a \"stay at home\" Christmas as they continue to try and save money in a tough market.

Price competition between the supermarkets remains stiff and Sainsbury's is continuing to pursue a complaint about Tesco's Price Promise promotion, which claims to compare the cost of goods at rival chains, even own-label items. The advertising watchdog has ruled that it is not unfair for Tesco to compare its own-label bananas with Sainsbury's Fairtrade ones, but the ruling is being appealed. King said: \"We think there is an important principle here, that it should not be for any individual retailer to determine whether they consider what they sell to be comparable.

After being spooked by the US government shutdown and more eurozone turmoil, investors have been calmed by the survival of the Italian government after a confidence vote and reasonable service sector surveys. But with precious metals still under pressure, Randgold Resources is down 65p at \u00a343.31 and Fresnillo has fallen 10p to 925p. Tesco has recovered a little after Wednesday's disappointing trading update, up 3.25p to 361.25p.",

      "bodyText": "BP has secured a victory in its battle to limit payouts over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, in a move that could save the company billions of dollars. The British oil firm welcomed a ruling by the US court of appeals that will force a rethink on how compensation claims related to the disaster will be assessed. The supreme court also ordered that payments must be stopped to people who did not suffer \"actual injury traceable to loss\" from the spill until cases have been properly heard and decided through the judicial process. The rig explosion killed 11 people and caused damage to those earning a living from fishing and tourism-related businesses along the coast. But BP has persistently argued that the formula for judging claims was too generous, resulting in payments to people who had not actually suffered from the explosion, including businesses that were located far inland but still claiming economic loss. Circuit judge Edith Brown Clement said: \"There is no need to secure peace with those with whom one is not at war. The district court had no authority to approve the settlement of a class that included members that had not sustained losses at all, or had sustained losses unrelated to the oil spill, as BP alleges. If the administrator is interpreting the settlement to include such claimants, the settlement is unlawful.\" The company had set aside $7.8bn (\u00a34.8bn) for compensation claims but by July the figure had risen to $9.6bn and was set to rise significantly without court intervention. Claims administrator Patrick Juneau said that about $3.69bn had been paid out in compensation. BP has already incurred more than $42bn of charges for cleanup costs, fines and compensation related to the spill. BP said in a statement on Thursday: \"[The] ruling affirms what BP has been saying since the beginning: claimants should not be paid for fictitious or wholly non-existent losses. We are gratified that the systematic payment of such claims by the claims administrator must now come to an end.\" Stephen Herman, a lawyer representing a group of claimants, said the vast majority of claimants would still receive compensation despite the ruling. He said: \"We look forward to working with the claims administrator and the court to determine the best way to get the affected claims processed and paid as soon as possible.\" Meanwhile, the second phase of a separate trial over the spill began on 30 September. It focuses on how much oil was spilled and BP's effort to control the flow, which are crucial questions in determining the size of the fine that BP must pay for its role in the disaster. The justice department claims that 4.2m barrels of oil flowed from the Macondo well in the wake of the explosion, with BP claiming that the true figure was closer to 2.4m barrels. Under the Clean Water Act, the company and its partners face fines of up to $1,100 for each barrel of oil spilled if they are found to have been negligent. The fines could rise to $4,300 per barrel if the judge is persuaded that BP and its partners' action constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
