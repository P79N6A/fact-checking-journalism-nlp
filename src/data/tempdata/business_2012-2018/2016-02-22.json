      "bodyText": "Mark Mangano visits Starbucks every day, usually to pick up an iced tea or a lemonade. Because of his frequent visits, Mangano, 43, is a longtime member of the Starbucks rewards program. The popular loyalty program awards members with a star for each transaction, regardless of how much the customer spends. After earning 12 stars, a member receives a free drink or food item of their choice. In April, the Seattle-based coffee chain will implement sweeping changes to its loyalty program that will limit the number of freebies its most loyal customers receive. Soon, members will have to earn 125 stars to receive a free item. For each dollar spent, the member will receive two stars \u2013 meaning to receive a free item, members will have to spend $62.50. Under the current terms, loyalty program members can buy a $2 coffee 12 times \u2013 spending $24 \u2013 to receive a freebie. People who use the loyalty program to buy cheaper items such as a small coffee, tea or lemonade lose out. It\u2019s a change that will directly affect customers like Mangano. As a member, he generally buys cheaper drinks for his first 12 purchases and upgrades to a larger drink size on his free item. Despite the forthcoming changes, Mangano, who had just left a Starbucks in Manhattan with a friend, said he will continue the membership. \u201cI\u2019d be OK with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re buying a certain amount of drinks, you\u2019re spending the money anyway.\u201d His thought process seems to match Starbucks\u2019 logic. Matthew Ryan, the company\u2019s chief strategy officer, said on Monday that the vast majority of customers will earn rewards at an equal or better rate with the change. Out of the 75 million customers who patronize Starbucks locations every month, 11 million are a part of its rewards program. As he waited for an iced black tea at a Starbucks in Manhattan, Joe Cipolla, also a member of the rewards program, said he visits the coffee chain about three times per week. He said he understood why Starbucks was undertaking the change. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s to get us to spend more money,\u201d he said. Upon hearing about the rewards program term changes, Ali Kazmi said Starbucks probably implemented them to \u201ccontrol spending within their own limits\u201d. Kazmi used to be a rewards card member, but he lost his coffee perks when he and his girlfriend broke up and she took over the account. \u201cI think she\u2019s still using it,\u201d Kazmi, 26, said on a smoke break outside Starbucks. \u201cI need to get it back.\u201d Despite the changes in terms, Kazmi said he would sign up for the program again. \u201cIt won\u2019t change anything for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI like other small coffee shops, and I like to support them, but you can\u2019t get a blonde roast like this anywhere else.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "US factories have suffered their worst month for three years, heaping further pressure on the Federal Reserve to hold off from raising interest rates when it meets next month. A sharp decline in exports and plunging domestic orders were blamed for the fall in activity for February, making the month the lowest point for US manufacturing since the start of 2013 and joint lowest with October 2009. A survey of European businesses also disappointed investors and indicated that recent turmoil in global markets has dealt the eurozone economy a bigger blow than previously estimated. Fed chiefs meet in three weeks to consider how to react to the global slowdown and slump in oil prices that has hit exports and stalled the US recovery since it raised rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has already indicated it is likely to inject further funds into the eurozone when its governing council meets in a fortnight. Fed chair Janet Yellen is expected to push for a delay in the next rise to 0.75% after she highlighted the difficulties faced by the global economy following a decline in Chinese manufacturing output and the knock-on effects for factories in the Asia region, Europe and the US. But she could meet resistance from her deputy, Stanley Fischer, who is known to be more cautious about abandoning the previous expectation for four rate hikes this year. John Williams, the head of the San Francisco Fed, told the Los Angeles Times that he saw no reason to delay after an increase in inflation over recent months. \u201cThe basic approach we took, which is a gradual rate increase, is still right,\u201d he said. US and European stock markets fell back on Monday as data appeared to show the worsening global situation spreading to the US, following a slight improvement in January. But the prospect of a delay to US interest rate rises kept stock values from losing all their gains from earlier in the day and pushed the Dow Jones in New York 236 points higher (at 18:30 GMT) to 16,623. The Dax climbed almost 2% to 9570 while the FTSE 100 closed at 6041, up more than 1.5%. Brent crude jumped by 5% to $34.7 (\u00a324) a barrel, higher than the $27 a barrel it hit at the beginning of the year, but lower than the $36 a barrel seen earlier this month. The Markit flash purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) of US manufacturing businesses registered the third month of decline out of the past four. Firms said they were largely unaffected by bad weather and instead blamed the high dollar for a steep fall in exports and uncertainty about the general economic outlook, which encouraged customers to delay spending decisions. After a rise in the index to 52.4 in January, it fell back to 51.0. A figure greater than 50 indicates expansion. Some analysts speculated that a collapse in orders for equipment from the US and Canadian oil industries, and especially fracking firms crippled by the low oil price, had hit US manufacturing harder than previously understood. Bill Lee, chief US economist at Citi, said before the PMI figures appeared that his previously bullish expectations of a recovery in manufacturing had failed to spot a crisis for factories manufacturing kit for the fracking industry. He said the expected \u201coil dividend\u201d \u2013 where consumers had been saving money on fuel \u2013 had been banked rather than spent, delaying an expected upturn in demand for US goods. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, which conducted the manufacturing survey, said: \u201cUS factories are reporting the worst business conditions for over three years. Every indicator, from output, order books and exports to employment, inventories and prices, is flashing a warning light about the health of the manufacturing economy.\u201d Companies, especially in the services sector, have continued hiring workers, but other indicators have shown the US economy stalling. Williamson said manufacturers were likely to start laying off workers if the situation persisted. \u201cWith backlogs of work slumping to the greatest extent since the height of the recession in 2009 and inventories rising for the third successive month, it\u2019s likely that firms will come under increasing pressure to cut payroll numbers and production in coming months unless demand revives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one caveat is that the survey was conducted in a month in which parts of the US suffered extreme weather. However, few survey respondents reported that the weather had a material impact on business over the month, instead often simply observing a general slowdown in trade and the economy.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Sky-high stakes, yet HSBC is taking risks with US justice", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC\u2019s directors should have spent less time pondering a move to Hong Kong and more time ensuring the bank will still have a business in the US in a few years\u2019 time. It is astonishing that, four years after HSBC paid a thumping \u00a31.2bn fine for allowing Mexican drug lords, among others, to launder money, the bank still hasn\u2019t put its house in order. The official US monitor, who has spent two years policing the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that accompanied the financial penalty, has \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about the pace of reform and HSBC\u2019s ability to meet the five-year deadline to combat financial crime competently. That is shocking, given what is at stake. As HSBC\u2019s annual reports puts it, breach of the DPA could have \u201ca material adverse effect on our business\u201d. You bet. Sanctions could include loss of banking licences and restrictions on clearing dollar transactions, either of which would be brutal for an organisation that pitches itself as a facilitator of global trade. HSBC\u2019s chairman, Douglas Flint, looking on the bright side, says nobody should have expected an official thumbs-up after only two years, which is why the DPA extends over half a decade in the first place. And 2016 will be \u201ca very important year\u201d, he says, as HSBC installs new technology to identity suspicious transactions. Well, OK, half-time is only just approaching. But a dutiful parent receiving a school report detailing \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about progress in a core subject would be reading the riot act at this point. Shareholders should insist that future bonuses for the \u00a37m-a-year chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, depend on meeting the DPA targets. HSBC cannot afford another run-in with the US Department of Justice. In the circumstances, you can understand why HSBC\u2019s shares trade at a level first seen as long ago as 1997. Nine pages of a 37-page summary of \u201chighlights\u201d from 2015 were consumed by \u201clegal proceedings and regulatory matters\u201d. These now include a role in the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s investigation into banks\u2019 hiring of \u201cprincelings\u201d, or the offspring of Asian government officials. As for actual highlights, they were in short supply. Revenues were virtually flat. Underlying pre-tax profits fell 7% to $20.4bn (\u00a314.5bn). Impaired loans rose 17%. Return on equity was an unsatisfactory 7.2%. HSBC remains a global financial powerhouse and the balance sheet is strong, but the next worry is a dividend that was covered only 1.3 times by lower earnings. The 8% yield sends an unmistakable message: the market thinks HSBC\u2019s empire is covered in fog. Business backs out \u201cThe voice of business must be heard,\u201d said David Cameron a few weeks ago, when warming up for the referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union. And here it comes: a letter advocating the merits of staying in signed by a brigade chairmen and chief executives from FTSE 100 firms. The letter-writing ritual has been established in recent general election campaigns and, at the margin, it may influence debate. Certainly, a once-in-a-generation referendum on a matter of national importance is more fertile territory for \u201cthe voice of business\u201d (a loose concept, in truth) to express itself than a contest between political parties. All the same, such clunky set-piece letters feel a little presumptuous. Many of the bosses will say they are signing in a personal capacity. It\u2019s a veneer. Most voters wouldn\u2019t be able to name the top brass of BAE Systems, Shell, etc. The directors\u2019 opinions only carry weight in a joint-letter because the names of their employers are attached. Yet the privilege of co-opting the company\u2019s name is extended only to members of the boardroom. The self-importance jars. So, well done, the boards of Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Tesco for refusing to take part. Letter-signing enthusiasts may regard the supermarket chiefs as lily-livered washouts who can\u2019t see further than their next quarterly trading update. But, actually, declining to annoy a significant percentage of your staff and customers seems entirely reasonable. Sainsbury\u2019s local worries Over at Sainsbury\u2019s, they have local worries \u2013 like how to respond to a possible rival bid for Home Retail Group from Steinhoff, the South African-based retailer. The first bit is easy: play for time and see if Steinhoff puts 175p-a-share on the table, as opposed to making a non-binding proposal. Assuming Steinhoff steps up, the question is whether to join a bidding war. Sainsbury\u2019s cash-and-shares offer, currently worth 165p, would obviously lose without an improvement. How high could Sainsbury\u2019s go without shredding its promises about financial discipline? The limit is probably about 180p. That would allow most of Sainsbury\u2019s promises about enhancement to earnings via gobbling Argos to survive. Going closer to 200p for shares that were trading at 100p would be silly. It would also signal zero confidence in the original go-it-alone strategy for non-food. Sainsbury\u2019s must remember the basics: an opportunistic bid is one you don\u2019t have to do.",

It is astonishing that, four years after HSBC <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-bank-us-money-laundering\">paid a thumping \u00a31.2bn fine</a> for allowing Mexican drug lords, among others, to launder money, the bank still hasn\u2019t put its house in order.</p> <p>The official US monitor, who has spent two years policing the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that accompanied the financial penalty, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/22/hsbc-full-year-profits-edge-up-to-132bn-as-chief-stuart-gulliver-takes-pay-cut\">has \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about the pace of reform</a> and HSBC\u2019s ability to meet the five-year deadline to combat financial crime competently.</p> <p>That is shocking, given what is at stake. As HSBC\u2019s annual reports puts it, breach of the DPA could have \u201ca material adverse effect on our business\u201d. You bet. Sanctions could include loss of banking licences and restrictions on clearing dollar transactions, either of which would be brutal for an organisation that pitches itself as a facilitator of global trade.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/22/hsbc-full-year-profits-edge-up-to-132bn-as-chief-stuart-gulliver-takes-pay-cut\">HSBC 'taking too long to tackle financial crime'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>HSBC\u2019s chairman, Douglas Flint, looking on the bright side, says nobody should have expected an official thumbs-up after only two years, which is why the DPA extends over half a decade in the first place. And 2016 will be \u201ca very important year\u201d, he says, as HSBC installs new technology to identity suspicious transactions.</p> <p>Well, OK, half-time is only just approaching. But a dutiful parent receiving a school report detailing \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about progress in a core subject would be reading the riot act at this point. Shareholders should insist that future bonuses for the \u00a37m-a-year chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, depend on meeting the DPA targets. HSBC cannot afford another run-in with the US Department of Justice.</p> <p>In the circumstances, you can understand why HSBC\u2019s shares trade at a level first seen as long ago as 1997. Nine pages of a 37-page summary of \u201chighlights\u201d from 2015 were consumed by \u201clegal proceedings and regulatory matters\u201d. These now include a role in the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s investigation into banks\u2019 hiring of \u201cprincelings\u201d, or the offspring of Asian government officials.</p> <p>As for actual highlights, they were in short supply. Revenues were virtually flat. Underlying pre-tax profits fell 7% to $20.4bn (\u00a314.5bn). Impaired loans rose 17%. Return on equity was an unsatisfactory 7.2%. </p> <p>HSBC remains a global financial powerhouse and the balance sheet is strong, but the next worry is a dividend that was covered only 1.3 times by lower earnings. The 8% yield sends an unmistakable message: the market thinks HSBC\u2019s empire is covered in fog.</p> <h2>Business backs out</h2> <p>\u201cThe voice of business must be heard,\u201d said David Cameron a few weeks ago, when warming up for the referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union. And here it comes: a letter advocating the merits of staying in signed by a brigade chairmen and chief executives from FTSE 100 firms.</p> <p>The letter-writing ritual has been established in recent general election campaigns and, at the margin, it may influence debate. Certainly, a once-in-a-generation referendum on a matter of national importance is more fertile territory for \u201cthe voice of business\u201d (a loose concept, in truth) to express itself than a contest between political parties. All the same, such clunky set-piece letters feel a little presumptuous.</p> <p>Many of the bosses will say they are signing in a personal capacity. It\u2019s a veneer. Most voters wouldn\u2019t be able to name the top brass of BAE Systems, Shell, etc. The directors\u2019 opinions only carry weight in a joint-letter because the names of their employers are attached. Yet the privilege of co-opting the company\u2019s name is extended only to members of the boardroom. The self-importance jars.</p> <p>So, well done, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/22/brexit-eu-referendum-top-firms-sign-letter-times-pro-eu-shell-easyjet-bae-systems-supermarkets-sainsbury-morrisons-tesco\">the boards of Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Tesco for refusing to take part</a>. Letter-signing enthusiasts may regard the supermarket chiefs as lily-livered washouts who can\u2019t see further than their next quarterly trading update. But, actually, declining to annoy a significant percentage of your staff and customers seems entirely reasonable.</p> <h2>Sainsbury\u2019s local worries</h2> <p>Over at Sainsbury\u2019s, they have local worries \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/22/sainsburys-18-march-deadline-new-home-retail-group-bid\">like how to respond to a possible rival bid for Home Retail Group from Steinhoff</a>, the South African-based retailer. The first bit is easy: play for time and see if Steinhoff puts 175p-a-share on the table, as opposed to making a non-binding proposal.</p> <p>Assuming Steinhoff steps up, the question is whether to join a bidding war. Sainsbury\u2019s cash-and-shares offer, currently worth 165p, would obviously lose without an improvement. How high could Sainsbury\u2019s go without shredding its promises about financial discipline?</p> <p>The limit is probably about 180p. That would allow most of Sainsbury\u2019s promises about enhancement to earnings via gobbling Argos to survive. Going closer to 200p for shares that were trading at 100p would be silly. It would also signal zero confidence in the original go-it-alone strategy for non-food. Sainsbury\u2019s must remember the basics: an opportunistic bid is one you don\u2019t have to do.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The pound tumbled to a seven-year low and the UK was warned its credit rating was at risk on Monday as the effect of Boris Johnson\u2019s backing for the Brexit campaign was felt in financial markets. However, as traders and city economists wagered that the London mayor\u2019s intervention had raised the probability of a leave vote in June\u2019s EU referendum, high-profile business figures threw their support behind prime minister David Cameron\u2019s push to stay in the EU. The bosses of some of Britain\u2019s top companies, including easyJet, the defence contractor BAE Systems and Shell, signed a letter backing a vote to stay in Europe. The letter was signed by the heads of about a third of the businesses on the FTSE 100 index of Britain\u2019s largest stock-market-listed companies. There were also some notable absentees from the list, including Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s. Rival supermarket chain Morrisons, which dropped out of the FTSE last year, also declined to sign the letter, which was compiled by City PR boss Roland Rudd. The supermarket groups, whichdid not back either side before the Scottish referendum, said the choice over whether to stay within the EU was one for the British people. The letter reads: \u201cThe businesses we lead represent every sector and region of the United Kingdom. Together we employ more than one million people across the country. \u201cFollowing the Prime Minister\u2019s renegotiation, we believe that Britain is better off staying in a reformed European Union. He has secured a commitment from the EU to reduce the burden of regulation, deepen the single market and to sign off crucial international trade deals. \u201cBusiness needs unrestricted access to the European market of 500 million people in order to continue to grow, invest and create jobs. We believe that leaving the EU would deter investment and threaten jobs. It would put the economy at risk. \u201cBritain will be stronger, safer and better off remaining a member of the European Union.\u201d On the markets, sterling dropped to a seven-year low against the dollar at $1.4057, and currency experts forecast more sharp falls in the run-up to the public vote. Market jitters have been made worse by widespread mistrust of opinion polls after they failed to predict last year\u2019s clear electoral win for the Conservative party. \u201cThe next four months will be racked with uncertainty. Recent referendum polls have been neck and neck. And, in any case, as illustrated by last year\u2019s general election and the 2014 Scottish referendum, even if they do start to give a clearer picture of the likely outcome, the opinion polls cannot be trusted,\u201d said analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets. Investment banks renewed warnings of the economic risks from a Brexit, predicting exports and investment would be hit. Britain\u2019s biggest bank, HSBC, used its annual results update to warn of a \u201cheightened risk of uncertainty\u201d from a vote to leave the EU. Those fears were reflected in currency markets where the pound suffered its biggest one-day drop of Cameron\u2019s premiership. The credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s put the government on alert that a decision to leave the EU could lead to a downgrade of the UK\u2019s strong credit score, potentially pushing up the cost of government borrowing. Moody\u2019s said the outcome of the vote \u201cremains too close to call\u201d. In the event of a vote to leave the EU, the economic costs would outweigh the benefits, Moody\u2019s said. \u201cThe outcome of the referendum remains wide open. In our view, a decision to leave the EU would be credit-negative for the UK economy,\u201d said Kathrin Muehlbronner at Moody\u2019s. Moody\u2019s rates the UK Aa1, one notch below the coveted top triple-A score. The agency said if the British public voted to leave the EU, it would consider assigning a \u201cnegative outlook\u201d to that rating, compared with a \u201cstable\u201d outlook currently. Such an forecast would imply a greater chance of a downgrade of the Aa1 rating in the future. Rival ratings agency Fitch said a Brexit would bring short-term disruption and long-term risks for the UK. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, the only big ratings agency still giving Britain the top ranking, has previously flagged risks from the referendum to the UK\u2019s financial services sector, its exports, and the wider economy. Presenting the bank\u2019s results on Monday, HSBC chairmannoted that the UK was the site for a disproportionately large number of big company headquarters and that a \u201cperiod of uncertainty\u201d after a leave vote would be very damaging. \u201cEvery business in the UK would be reviewing its supply chain, legal agreements and its licences,\u201d Douglas Flint said. Supporters for the leave campaign have countered that in the long term the UK would be better off outside the EU. Explaining his backing for the Brexit camp, Johnson said he wanted \u201ca better deal for the people of this country, to save them money and to take control\u201d. Economists at Citi investment bank raised the probability of Brexit from 20-30% to 30-40% after Johnson and the justice secretary, Michael Gove, announced their support for the leave campaign. \u201cSo far, polls still suggest that the UK is more likely to vote to stay in the EU than to leave, and indeed \u2018remain\u2019 is still our base case scenario,\u201d Citi economists Tina Fordham and Michael Saunders said. \u201cHaving said that, following the decision of credible and popular leaders like Johnson and Gove to back the out campaign, we now increase the probability that the UK votes for Brexit.\u201d The UK\u2019s stock market largely shrugged off Brexit fears on Monday, with the FTSE 100 index rising 1.5% to 6,037.73. But there were some notable fallers. Shares in housebuilders dropped sharply on worries the run-up to the referendum, and a possible leave vote, could hurt the property market.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has been given until 18 March to consider whether it will return with a new bid for Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, after its takeover attempt was gatecrashed by South Africa\u2019s Steinhoff International. The supermarket sought an extension of the so-called \u201cput up or shut up\u201d deadline, previously set by City regulators for Tuesday 23 February, after Steinhoff tabled a surprise bid for Home Retail late on Friday. Shares in Home Retail Group soared 13% to 173.7p on Monday as several retail analysts said they expected Sainsbury\u2019s to at least match Steinhoff\u2019s \u00a31.42bn cash bid, worth 175p a share. The South Africans\u2019 potential offer, which is subject to due diligence, is only a 6% premium to the Sainsbury\u2019s putative cash and shares offer agreed earlier this month, which would be worth \u00a31.34bn at today\u2019s share price. Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s closed down 2.2% at 255p. The new deadline for Sainsbury\u2019s to decide on its offer is the same day as Steinhoff\u2019s put-up-or-shut-up deadline, potentially setting up an auction for Home Retail. Mike Dennis, a retail analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said he expected Sainsbury\u2019s to at least match Steinhoff\u2019s offer, which was currently more attractive to investors because it was all cash. But Dennis said it was likely Sainsbury\u2019s would have to have found more potential cost savings, benefits or assets sales after examining Home Retail\u2019s books over the past three weeks in order to justify raising its bid. The supermarket is under pressure from shareholders not to overpay for Argos, as some are sceptical about taking on a business that has struggled to increase sales and profits in recent years. It has a strong rival in Steinhoff, which owns furniture retailers Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK, plus Conforama in France as well as discount chains in Africa and Australasia. The bid for Home Retail marks the latest move into the UK by Christo Wiese, the South African entrepreneur who owns a 17% stake in Steinhoff and already controls New Look and grocery chain Iceland in the UK via his Brait investment vehicle. He is also backing former Asda boss Andy Bond\u2019s Pep &amp; Co cut-price fashion chain through Pepkor, which was acquired by Steinhoff late last year. With a market value of \u20ac18bn (\u00a314bn), Steinhoff is nearly three times the size of Sainsbury\u2019s (\u00a34.8bn) and so is likely to be able to achieve better benefits from merging buying with Argos, particularly on unbranded household goods. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s might have a more compelling, forward-thinking strategy for Argos ... but the risk for Sainsbury\u2019s is that Steinhoff will raise the bar to a level that Sainsbury\u2019s cannot match,\u201d said Scott Ransley, a retail analyst at Stifel. Dennis said: \u201cWe believe that losing out to Steinhoff may be a blessing in disguise for Sainsbury\u2019s.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s has had to work hard to convince shareholders and analysts of the logic of a potential takeover of Argos. The Qatari Investment Authority, Sainsbury\u2019s largest shareholder, has expressed unease about the retailer\u2019s bid. It is understood the fund does not want to see its stake in Sainsbury\u2019s diluted by the issue of new shares or to have to put in further investment to maintain its stake. Sainsbury\u2019s will also be aware that tabling a bid for Home Retail worth more than \u00a31.2bn, or a quarter of the supermarket\u2019s stock market value, will trigger a shareholder vote on the matter. Any opposition from the QIA could potentially block a deal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A growing risk of Britain leaving the European Union has sent the pound tumbling. Against the dollar the UK currency has suffered its biggest one day fall since prime minister David Cameron first came to power in 2010. It has fallen 1.72% to $1.4156, its worst daily performance since May 6 2010 - the day of the general election - when it fell 2.22%. It has also reached its lowest level against the US currency since March 2009. Against a basket of currencies the pound is at its weakest since April 2014. The fears of a Brexit grew as London mayor Boris Johnson said he backed the UK leaving the European Union, while Moody\u2019s added to the uncertainty by saying the country\u2019s credit rating could be affected. ETX Capital currency trader Richard Wiltshire told Reuters: Boris has upset the apple cart in going against his party leader. Everyone is now thinking it\u2019s going to be a much closer-run thing than we previously thought. On that note it\u2019s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A rebound in commodity prices has lifted European shares despite the uncertainty created by the prospect of the UK leaving the European Union. Hopes of further Chinese stimulus to boost its economy and thus increase demand for commodities lifted metal prices, while oil was also higher in the wake of last week\u2019s proposals to freeze supply levels and talk that US shale output was falling. The pound dropped sharply as London mayor Boris Johnson said he would campaign for a Brexit, but stock markets shrugged off the uncertainty. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 87.50 points or 1.47% at 6037.73 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.98% to 9573.59 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.79% to 4298.70 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 3.52% to 17,504.58 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 2.35% at 8387.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.55% to 487.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 213 points or 1.3%. Sterling is likely to continue falling even with the risk of Brexit, says Capital Economics, partly because the US is likely to continue raising interest rates while the Bank of England holds steady. The research group\u2019s analyst John Higgins said: Our forecast remains that sterling will fall further against the dollar this year, to $1.30 from around $1.41 now. Granted, the exchange rate has already fallen a long way in 2016, despite some stability in the gap between UK and US interest rate expectations. And if the recent experience of Scotland\u2019s referendum on membership of the UK is any guide, the exchange rate could rebound if it becomes clear to investors that the UK electorate will vote to stay in the EU. After all, sterling\u2019s slide on Monday was similar in scale to the one that took place on the 8th September 2014, when a YouGov poll suggested Scotland might vote to secede from the UK \u2013 that slide had been completed unwound by the time the referendum took place eleven days later. Yet a week is a long time in politics, let alone four months. So now, as then, there is ample opportunity for uncertainty about the result of the referendum to weigh on sterling, especially given the UK\u2019s reliance on foreign investors to plug its large current account deficit. Indeed, our forecast that sterling will fall to $1.30 is partly based on a view that a further decline in the UK\u2019s currency is needed in order to rebalance her economy... There is another key reason why we expect sterling to lose more ground against the dollar, which is the relative prospects for monetary policy in the UK and US... The risk of a Brexit could make the Bank of England disinclined to begin to tighten monetary policy before the referendum and we think it is likely to tread cautiously thereafter. Our end-2016 forecast for UK Bank Rate is therefore 0.75%. While this is more hawkish than the rate implied in the market, it represents just one 25 basis point increase from the current level. By contrast, our end-2016 forecast for the US federal funds rate is a range of 1.0-1.25%, the equivalent of a further three increases of 25 basis points each. We continue to expect the Fed to tighten monetary policy much more rapidly than expected by the average investor as a tightening labour market in the US puts upward pressure on wage inflation. Credit Suisse has taken a stab at what the UK could look like outside the EU: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: There is no doubt that the Brexit referendum is rapidly becoming one of the biggest risk events of 2016 for financial markets. Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to bolster the \u2018out\u2019 campaign with his support not only serves to undermine the fruits of David Cameron\u2019s labour in Brussels, but clearly damages UK economic confidence, with sterling pounded across the board today. With the referendum set to take place in June, when the migrant crisis will be back into full flow, anxiety and fear will certainly push some voters towards a more isolationist stance. David Cameron\u2019s statement to the Commons is being covered on our politics live blog. Sterling seems to be picking up slightly as he speaks, but the questioning once he finishes is likely to be key. As prime minister David Cameron stands up in the Commons to defend his EU deal, ING Bank suggests the pound could have further to fall. Strategist Viraj Patel said: We remain cautious in prematurely calling the end of the Brexit-induced GBP downside. The role of Brexit in steering recent sterling price action can be likened to a roller coaster warming up with some small twist and turns before an inevitable sharp drop. Our short-term financial models show that even after today\u2019s sharp move lower, only a 1.5-2.0% risk premium is priced into sterling/dollar. Moreover, other UK asset markets are yet to be trading with any meaningful discount, while UK activity data is also likely to show signs of a temporary slowdown over the coming months. Hence, there are still valid reasons why the UK\u2019s in-out referendum poses further downside risks to the pound. Sterling\u2019s recent immunity to opinion polls is a double-edged sword; while any under-estimation of Brexit risks by markets would limit near-term downside, the economic and political costs of a Brexit are likely to dawn on investors as we approach the June vote. As such, the pricing in of any Brexit risk premium could manifest itself swiftly and aggressively (while only fully showing up in the weeks or months leading up the vote). Expect sterling implied volatilities to stay very elevated, particularly those covering the referendum date. Today\u2019s price action in the pound risk reversals shows the \u201clongevity\u201d of Brexit risks (ie, the enduring nature of downside potential stemming from a UK exit). Everyone wants their say on Brexit and after Moody\u2019s, comes Fitch. The ratings agency says the impact of a vote for Britain to leave the EU is uncertain but could have significant risks, depending on the reaction of the remainder of the Union: Lengthy negotiations and uncertainty over UK firms\u2019 future access to EU markets following a vote to leave in the upcoming referendum on EU membership (Brexit) would weigh on confidence and delay investment decisions. This would have a short-term economic cost, although the precise impact would be highly uncertain... We believe that in the event of a Leave vote, the authorities on both sides would try to avoid disrupting the deep economic and financial integration between the UK and EU by establishing a clear new relationship, including a trade agreement that preserves UK attractiveness for investment. Some tightening of the freedom of EU citizens\u2019 to work in the UK would be likely. Avoiding large-scale, permanent disruption to trade relations, including services, could limit the long-term economic cost to the UK, with Brexit only moderately negative for the UK. But there would be significant risks, especially if the remaining EU members attempted to impose punitive conditions on the UK to deter other countries from leaving, or the UK sought very tough restrictions on EU citizens coming to work in the UK. Back with the pound, and the trade weighted index - its value against a basket of currencies - shows the UK currency is just above its 2014 lows but well above its lows of five years ago. Over to the US briefly and some weaker than expected manufacturing figures, adding to the idea that a rate rise from the Federal Reserve could be some way off. The Markit initial estimate for the manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 51 for February compared to forecasts of 52.3 and last month\u2019s figure of 52.4. This is the lowest reading since October 2012. The news has supported equity markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up 1.3% or 221 points. Here\u2019s our news story on Moody\u2019s EU referendum warning: World stock markets continue to be unbothered by the Brexit issue. Wall Street just opened, and the main US stock indices are up around 1%. In London, the FTSE 100 index of Britain\u2019s largest companies is romping ahead, up 99 points or 1.7%. Investors are in merry mood, because the oil price has rallied today -- calming fears of a worldwide economic downturn and a crude glut. The UK government\u2019s attempts to drum up support from Britain\u2019s top bosses has hit a snag. Three of the country\u2019s largest supermarket chains, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Tesco, are declining to sign a letter backing the Remain campaign. Here\u2019s the story: City firm IG has just launched a new referendum barometer, showing how investors expect June\u2019s vote to pan out. And it shows that the In campaign are expected to breeze home, although the odds have narrowed. According to IG: The data currently shows IG clients are still overwhelmingly predicting Britain is likely to remain in the EU at 67%. The likelihood of the UK leaving the EU has, however, risen 2% to 33%. The pound is also losing more ground against the euro. It has lost 1.25 eurocents so far today,or around 1%, to trade at \u20ac1.2774. That\u2019s only its lowest point since last week, though. German\u2019s Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t happy with Boris today. Their chief investment strategist, Dr Ulrich Stephan, has tweeted that Brexit would be bad for Britain. Deutsche Bank employs around 8,000 people in London, and another 1,500 in Birmingham. Breaking News: The pound has just hits its lowest point against the US dollar in almost seven years. Sterling has extended its losses, and just traded below $1.406 against the US dollar. That\u2019s the lowest level since March 2009. The pound has now lost over three cents today, tumbling by over 2.3%, as Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to back the Out campaign continues to cause shockwaves through the international currency markets. As this chart shows, the pound is its weakest since David Cameron came to power in May 2010. Today\u2019s selloff is still the worst since the 2010 general election (which delivered a hung parliament). Bill O\u2019Neill, head of the UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, has predicted that the Leave campaign will soon run out of steam, despite the Boris bounce. \u201cWe expect UK markets to be volatile over coming days as the campaigns step up a gear and investors adjust to the prospect of a referendum four months from now, but our base case remains that the UK population will decide to remain in the EU. Our Brexit probability remains at 30% as we monitor the public response to the agreement with other EU members.\u201d Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, has warned that there will be a \u201cheightened risk of uncertainty\u201d if Britain votes to leave the EU. Flint said: \u201cEvery business in the UK would be reviewing its supply chain, legal agreements and its licences\u201d. He said the UK had a disproportionately large number of companies headquartered here and \u201cthat period of uncertainty would be very damaging\u201d. The bank has already said that the referendum or any vote to leave would not make it revisit its decision to remain headquartered in London, where it has been based since 1992. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver said that the broad impact on the UK would come from the fact that the EU is the country\u2019s largest trading partner. But Gulliver said he did not expect London\u2019s predominance as a foreign exchange trading market to be damaged. Investment bank Citi has just hiked its prediction for Brexit to between 30% and 40%. They took the move after Boris Johnson and Michael Gove (another senior Conservative) both backed the Out campaign over the weekend. That\u2019s up from 20-30%, suggesting a greater chance that Britain leaves the EU.... ....or perhaps just greater uncertainty over the whole thing. The pound has now fallen to its lowest level in 22 months, when measured against a basket of other currencies (Reuters reports). World First\u2019s Jeremy Cook wins a small prize (a pound, perhaps?) for spotting that sterling isn\u2019t the worst-performing currency today. It\u2019s pretty close, though - only Liberia, the Seychelles and the small African island of Sao Tome &amp; Principe are having a bleaker day than Britain in the FX market. The sterling selloff is getting even worse, as the US financial markets shuffle into life after the weekend. The pound is now down by over 1.9% against the US dollar at $1.4122, a fall of 2.7 cents. Wall Street investors may be frantically catching up with events across the Pond. Despite Boris\u2019s backing the Out campaign still only have a 30% chance of victory, reckons Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group. Rahman point out that the In campaign has the support of many other senior Conservatives, including Home Secretary Theresa May. And he predicts that David Cameron will relentlessly push his view that the UK\u2019s new arrangement is \u201cthe best of both worlds.\u201d Here\u2019s the key points from Rahman\u2019s new research note: The loss of Boris Johnson is a significant blow to David Cameron given Johnson\u2019s potential to transform the \u201cout\u201d campaign and create broader contagion within the Tory party in favour of leaving the EU. However, the backing of most key cabinet figures, elder statesmen and big business for an in vote will soften the blow. As Downing Street now pivots away from the deal onto broader themes of security, trade and jobs, the out camp will still struggle to present a coherent vision for post-BREXIT Britain. Today\u2019s selloff could be the start of a significant slump in the value of the pound. So fears Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, who says the pound is \u201creeling\u201d from the London Mayor\u2019s move. He writes: \u201cSterling seems to have fallen off the Boris cliff this morning..... \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s cleverly staged endorsement of the campaign to leave the United Kingdom grabbed headlines, and regardless of the London Mayor\u2019s political motivations, this has had a sharp effect on sterling exchange rates. The implication is clear: while the Brexit referendum remains a live prospect, sterling is likely to be susceptible to these types of shocks, especially as the referendum date approaches. \u201cThis could just be the start of the great Brexit Selloff of 2016. As June 23rd approaches, polling is likely to narrow between the yes and no camps. In the run-up to the Scottish referendum some polls were even showing the independence vote on top. The prospect of such an event is pretty sobering for sterling, which would likely fall through even the multi-year lows seen earlier this year if this weekend\u2019s reaction is anything to go by.\u201d The business group CBI has some slightly brighter news for Britain\u2019s struggling manufacturing sector this month. Its latest poll of factory bosses found total order books remained steady after a fall in January, whilst export orders saw a very slight improvement from the previous month. Both now stand at around average levels. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, notes that a weaker pound is helping exporters. She comments: \u201cDemand and output have remained relatively unchanged from January\u2019s performance. The challenging outlook for the manufacturing sector has stabilised a little, with sterling having depreciated, but Britain\u2019s manufacturers are still facing a difficult global situation.\u201d Investors are anticipating many long weeks of drama around the EU referendum, which could shift the markets: Here\u2019s more reaction from the City to Boris\u2019s intervention: Rating agency Moody\u2019s has weighed in on the EU referendum - warning that it could cut Britain\u2019s credit rating if the Out Campaign win in June. It told clients this morning that the outcome of the referendum is \u201ctoo close to call\u201d, and that Brexit would harm the economy. Here\u2019s a flavour: In Moody\u2019s view the economic costs of a decision to leave the EU would outweigh the economic benefits. Unless the UK managed to negotiate a new trade arrangement with the EU that preserves at least some of the trade benefits of EU membership, the UK\u2019s exports would suffer. It would likely lead to a prolonged period of uncertainty, which would negatively affect investment, in Moody\u2019s view. It would also place a significant burden on policy-makers who would have to renegotiate the UK\u2019s trade relations with the EU and other countries and regions, as well as reconsider other areas such as regulatory and immigration policies.... Moody\u2019s added that it could cut the outlook on Britain\u2019s credit rating to \u2018negative\u2019 after the referendum. It says: Moody\u2019s would consider reflecting those threats to the UK\u2019s credit standing by assigning a negative outlook to the sovereign\u2019s Aa1 rating following a vote to exit, pending greater clarity on the longer-term impact on the UK\u2019s economic and financial strength. A negative outlook can be the first step towards a full-blown downgrade. More bad news. The pound has hit a 15-month low against a basket of other currencies, according to a Reuters newsflash. Sterling is only at a three-week low against the US dollar. But if it loses another cent, it will be its lowest in over six years. New economic surveys have shown that Europe\u2019s economy is slowing, potentially bolstering the Brexit case. Business growth across the eurozone is currently the weakest in over a year, data firm Markit reported this morning. Its eurozone PMI, which tracks thousands of service sector and manufacturing firms, has dropped to 52.7 this month, from 53.3, closer to the stagnation point (50.0). That suggests the eurozone economic recover, never the most vigorous of creatures, is running out of steam. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is up and running, covering all the drama in Westminster in his Politics Live blog. He\u2019s kicked off with the news that Boris\u2019s father, Stanley, has firmly denied that his son is scheming to become prime minister by supporting the Out campaign. Stanley told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that: I think he has done a really well-thought-out move. When I say move, it is a move in the sense it represents his deep conviction that at this moment this is what he needed to do. Honestly, I think to say this is a careerist sort of move would be a total travesty. I cannot think of any more career-ending move than to do what he did yesterday, in the sense that he is leaving the mayoralty in May. If he wanted to get a nice job in the cabinet on May 8 this is not the way to do it. The pound has fallen against all 31 of the other major currencies this morning, showing the scale of the rout: Ouch. The pound has now suffered its biggest one-day fall since the 2010 general election. This morning\u2019s 1.7% plunge hasn\u2019t been seen since May 2010, according to the data on our Reuters terminals. Bloomberg agrees, saying: The pound dropped 1.7% to $1.4163 as of 9:20 a.m. in London, set for the biggest decline since the the day of the U.K. General Election on May 6, 2010. While the currency is down 3.9% this year, it remains above an almost seven-year low of $1.4080 reached in January. Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Credit Agricole, confirms that the City is more worried about the June referendum: \u201cThe fact that prominent members of the Conservative Party announced they will campaign for Britain to leave the EU likely underscored investors\u2019 concerns that Brexit risks could increase from here despite the deal.\u201d Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, suggests Boris\u2019s popularity is fuelling today\u2019s sterling selloff: \u201cThe British Pound slumped at the start of the trading week after London Mayor Boris Johnson said he would campaign for the UK to leave the EU ahead of a referendum on membership in the regional bloc set for June 23. A recent poll showed Johnson is second only to Prime Minister David Cameron in influencing likely voters. (that\u2019s the IPSOS Mori poll I posted earlier) Sterling is plumbing new depths, as Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to defy David Cameron continues to reverberate around the trading floors. The pound has now dropped to $1.416 against the US dollar, a fall of 1.7% or 2.5 cents. That\u2019s the biggest fall in at least 11 months. This chart shows how sterling took an immediate dive last night when trading began in Asia, and then weakened further once European traders got to their desks: Jeremy Cook of currency firm World First reckons the City is over-reacting to Boris\u2019s move. This handy chart from Bloomberg shows how the pound has become much more volatile (white line) in recent weeks: Here\u2019s another sign of growing alarm in the City over the EU referendum. The cost of protecting against wild swings in the value of the pound has hit a 51-month high this morning. That suggests investors are more worried about Britain leaving the European Union, following Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to back the Out campaign Reuters has the details: The six-month implied volatility in sterling/dollar -- a gauge of how sharp currency moves will be -- rose to 12.2 percent its highest since late 2011, according toReuters charts. The contract captures the date of the referendum, scheduled for June 23. RBS Capital Markets analyst Sam Hill also blames the Out Campaign for weakening the pound: With both Michael Gove and Boris Johnson coming down on the \u201cLeave\u201d side of the debate, and almost half of the Conservative MPs, it is understandable that Sterling\u2019s initial move has been lower. Uncertainty is the only certainty where the economics of Brexit is concerned. So, with political reaction to Friday\u2019s deal looking more mixed than the Prime Minister would have hoped for, in the short term it is likely that the exchange rate will be sensitive to news which is seen to increase the probability of Brexit. Scotiabank analyst Alan Clarke agrees that Boris\u2019s intervention is significant. He told clients this morning that: Another key development over the weekend was that London Mayor, Boris Johnson MP came out in support of the \u2018leave\u2019 campaign. This is potentially crucial since he is the most popular politician in the country and connects with young and old voters alike. British government debt appears to be suffering from the swirling uncertainty over the EU referendum. The price of 10 year gilts (bonds issued by the UK) has fallen this morning. That pushed up the interest rate, or yield, on the debt to 1.44%, up from 1.41% on Friday. That isn\u2019t a huge move, and it still leaves Britain\u2019s borrowing costs at near-record lows. But it does indicate that investors are taking the Brexit threat more seriously. The pound is suffering from the fresh uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future, explains Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct: The \u201cBrexit\u201d conversation took another step forward over the weekend and this has the potential to dominate many a conversation over the next four months, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that some established fund managers have already come forward to say that in or out will have little impact on the financial outlook for UK Plc. What is significant however is that this introduces a new layer of uncertainty into the equation, and that\u2019s something broadly disliked by financial markets. Although the pound is suffering this morning, shares in London are doing well. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 77 points, or 1.3% this morning, putting the blue-chip index back over the six thousands point mark at 6027. That extends its recent recovery, following heavy losses in January and early February. Mining stocks are leading the rally, suggesting fears of a global recession have eased (just in time for investors to worry about Brexit instead). Bloomberg have confirmed that sterling is suffering its biggest selloff since last March: The pound is likely to keep falling in the run-up to June\u2019s vote, City experts fear. Currency expert Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, the French bank, warns: The EU \u2018Brexit\u2019 referendum is going to dominate media debate over the next 124 days. Opinon polls show a small lead for the \u2018out\u2019 camp, but a large body of \u2018undecideds\u2019 will decide the eventual outcome.... I think we are likely to see further sterling weakness ahead of the vote itself, as the debate rages and uncertainty undermines confidence. I can\u2019t imagine the opinion polls moving decisively enough in either direction for clarity to emerge before June 23. Sterling is also losing ground against the euro this morning. The pound has lost almost one eurocent, to \u20ac1.281, down from \u20ac1.29. That means one euro is worth 78.06p, up from 77.30p on Friday night - before David Cameron struck his EU deal. This poll shows why City investors are taking the London Mayor\u2019s move seriously: The pound has hit a three week low against the US dollar thanks to Boris\u2019s intervention. This makes sterling the worst performing major currency this morning. As things stand, the pound is on track for its biggest fall since March 19 2015, when it fell by 1.5% against the dollar. Boris Johnson\u2019s shock decision to back the Brexit campaign has sent the pound sliding, on track for its biggest fall in months. Asian traders were swift to react to the sight of the London Mayor telling a media scrum yesterday that he would be supporting the Out campaign in June\u2019s EU referendum And the selloff is accelerating right now -- wiping more than two cents off the pound. It has fallen from $1.44 to just $1.419, a drop of nearly 1.5%. That\u2019s a very chunky move for a currency, suggesting investors are scrambling to react to Boris\u2019s call for a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime chance to vote for real change in Britain\u2019s relations with Europe\u201d. Writing in the Telegraph, Johnson argues: This is the only opportunity we will ever have to show that we care about self-rule. A vote to Remain will be taken in Brussels as a green light for more federalism, and for the erosion of democracy. And here\u2019s the damage: Boris\u2019s move has raised the stakes in the referendum battle, and prompted bookmakers to narrow the odds. But the In Campaign are still the favourite. Chris Weston of City firm IG explains: Boris Johnson (BoJo) showing his hand does throw a spanner in the works, but the odds of a \u2018Brexit\u2019 are still around 35%. If the referendum can be won by the media then a scan of the headlines would say the odds of a \u2018Brexit\u2019 is modestly higher, but clearly the \u2018Leave\u2019 camp would certainly have liked a longer lead time. A weaker pound will be welcomed by British exporters, and the tourism industry. But it won\u2019t particularly please the big banks in the City, who like sterling to be strong. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today could be dominated by talk about Europe. With Britain\u2019s new arrangement with the EU agreed, but not yet approved by the people, the City is considering the implications of David Cameron\u2019s deal. Could the polls be right (for once), when they say the Remain side holds a healthy lead. Or could the London Mayor\u2019s decision to back the Out campaign reshape the whole campaign? Boris\u2019s bombshell has already put sterling under pressure in Asian trading, and we\u2019ll see today how the City digests his move. It could be a lively four months, with the referendum due on 23rd June. But how strong is the European economy anyway? We get fresh clues this morning, when purchasing manager index data (PMIs) from the eurozone are released. That will will show how fast, or slow, the euro economy is growing: 8am: French manufacturing and services PMI 8.30am: German manufacturing and services PMI 9am: Eurozone manufacturing and services PMI We\u2019re expecting a gentle start to trading in London, with the main indices tipped to rise a little. Here\u2019s IG\u2019s opening calls: In the corporate world, HSBC will be under scrutiny after reporting profits of \u00a313.2bn ($18.8bn) for the last year, and revealing its boss has taken a pay cut: And Associated British Foods, which owns discount clothing chain Primark, is announcing results this morning.

The research group\u2019s analyst John Higgins said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our forecast remains that sterling will fall further against the dollar this year, to $1.30 from around $1.41 now. Granted, the exchange rate has already fallen a long way in 2016, despite some stability in the gap between UK and US interest rate expectations.</p> <p> And if the recent experience of Scotland\u2019s referendum on membership of the UK is any guide, the exchange rate could rebound if it becomes clear to investors that the UK electorate will vote to stay in the EU. After all, sterling\u2019s slide on Monday was similar in scale to the one that took place on the 8th September 2014, when a YouGov poll suggested Scotland might vote to secede from the UK \u2013 that slide had been completed unwound by the time the referendum took place eleven days later.</p> <p> Yet a week is a long time in politics, let alone four months. So now, as then, there is ample opportunity for uncertainty about the result of the referendum to weigh on sterling, especially given the UK\u2019s reliance on foreign investors to plug its large current account deficit. Indeed, our forecast that sterling will fall to $1.30 is partly based on a view that a further decline in the UK\u2019s currency is needed in order to rebalance her economy...</p> <p>There is another key reason why we expect sterling to lose more ground against the dollar, which is the relative prospects for monetary policy in the UK and US...</p> <p>The risk of a Brexit could make the Bank of England disinclined to begin to tighten monetary policy before the referendum and we think it is likely to tread cautiously thereafter. Our end-2016 forecast for UK Bank Rate is therefore 0.75%. While this is more hawkish than the rate implied in the market, it represents just one 25 basis point increase from the current level.</p> <p>By contrast, our end-2016 forecast for the US federal funds rate is a range of 1.0-1.25%, the equivalent of a further three increases of 25 basis points each.

Strategist Viraj Patel said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We remain cautious in prematurely calling the end of the Brexit-induced GBP downside.</p> <p>The role of Brexit in steering recent sterling price action can be likened to a roller coaster warming up with some small twist and turns before an inevitable sharp drop.</p> <p>Our short-term financial models show that even after today\u2019s sharp move lower, only a 1.5-2.0% risk premium is priced into sterling/dollar. Moreover, other UK asset markets are yet to be trading with any meaningful discount, while UK activity data is also likely to show signs of a temporary slowdown over the coming months. Hence, there are still valid reasons why the UK\u2019s in-out referendum poses further downside risks to the pound.</p> <p>Sterling\u2019s recent immunity to opinion polls is a double-edged sword; while any under-estimation of Brexit risks by markets would limit near-term downside, the economic and political costs of a Brexit are likely to dawn on investors as we approach the June vote. As such, the pricing in of any Brexit risk premium could manifest itself swiftly and aggressively (while only fully showing up in the weeks or months leading up the vote).</p> <p>Expect sterling implied volatilities to stay very elevated, particularly those covering the referendum date. Today\u2019s price action in the pound risk reversals shows the \u201clongevity\u201d of Brexit risks (ie, the enduring nature of downside potential stemming from a UK exit).</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cb28a3e4b00221da78b16a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-22T15:30:25.472Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Everyone wants their say on Brexit and after <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/22/pound-falls-city-gets-brexit-jitters-business-live?page=with:block-56cb20c9e4b041c56e71d6ca#block-56cb20c9e4b041c56e71d6ca\">Moody\u2019s</a></strong>, comes Fitch.</p> <p>The ratings agency says the impact of a vote for Britain to leave the EU is uncertain but could have significant risks, depending on the reaction of the remainder of the Union:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lengthy negotiations and uncertainty over UK firms\u2019 future access to EU markets following a vote to leave in the upcoming referendum on EU membership (Brexit) would weigh on confidence and delay investment decisions.

Some tightening of the freedom of EU citizens\u2019 to work in the UK would be likely. Avoiding large-scale, permanent disruption to trade relations, including services, could limit the long-term economic cost to the UK, with Brexit only moderately negative for the UK. </p> <p>But there would be significant risks, especially if the remaining EU members attempted to impose punitive conditions on the UK to deter other countries from leaving, or the UK sought very tough restrictions on EU citizens coming to work in the UK.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-22T15:34:26.225Z\">at 3.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56cb2667e4b0f2fd18caff23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-22T15:19:36.809Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the pound, and the trade weighted index - its value against a basket of currencies - shows the UK currency is just above its 2014 lows but well above its lows of five years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfa6c025f00c827ae4f56cf881948beb22b29dc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa6c025f00c827ae4f56cf881948beb22b29dc9/0_0_577_345/500.jpg\" alt=\"Pound trade weighted index\" width=\"500\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pound trade weighted index</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cb21c8e4b00221da78b14f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-22T15:04:22.806Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US manufacturing weaker than forecast</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over to the US briefly and some weaker than expected manufacturing figures, adding to the idea that a rate rise from the Federal Reserve could be some way off.</p> <p>The Markit initial estimate for the manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 51 for February compared to forecasts of 52.3 and last month\u2019s figure of 52.4.

The disclosure was made on Monday as the bank reported a 1% rise in profits and a cut in the pay of its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, from \u00a37.6m to \u00a37.3m. Robin Hood Tax campaigners lobbying for what they argue is fairer taxation of the financial sector criticised the payouts. \u201cIt may have been a bumpy year for HSBC, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the flow of bumper payouts. Many more millionaires made and \u00a37.3m for the chief executive is hardly the picture of a reformed financial sector,\u201d the group said. \u201cThe banking sector is still completely out of sync with the rest of the economy. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest that the UK has a more level playing field. The chancellor should take note.\u201d The pay of non-executive directors \u2013 almost all of whom receive more than \u00a3100,000 \u2013 was disclosed. Rona Fairhead \u2013 who chaired HSBC\u2019s audit committee at the time of the tax scandal in its Swiss arm \u2013 is the highest paid non-executive, receiving \u00a3524,000, up from \u00a3513,000. Chair of the BBC Trust, Fairhead is leaving the HSBC board this year after chairing its US subsidiary. Jonathan Symonds, the former finance director of Novartis who chairs HSBC\u2019s European arm, received \u00a3521,000. Phillip Ameen, who chairs the audit committee and is member of the risk committee of the bank\u2019s US arm, received \u00a3416,000. A former director, Sandy Flockhart, who left in April 2012, also received \u00a3155,503 because of double taxation he incurred in Hong Kong and the UK. The bank is preparing to ask shareholders to approve a policy for its top management to incorporate a closer link to shareholder returns in the bonuses paid out through the three-year long-term incentive plan. Under new scheme rules, Gulliver\u2019s possible potential annual pay is being cut to \u00a39.9m from up to \u00a313m in the past. The minimum amount he can receive will be \u00a33.3m, down from \u00a33.5m, which includes a \u00a31.25m salary, \u00a31.7m fixed-pay allowance intended to shelter him from the EU cap on bonuses and a \u00a3625,000 pension contribution. That contribution is being cut from 50% of his salary to 30% in response to investor concerns. Gulliver also received \u00a3662,000 in benefits, largely to cover the cost of living in a property owned by the bank in Hong Kong. The bank said the introduction of UK rules that require bonuses to be deferred over seven years, rather than three, were more stringent than those in the EU, US and Asia-Pacific, \u201cmaking it challenging for UK banks to attract talent with transferable skills or from other industries\u201d. \u201cWe believe more regulator coordination is required to ensure there are more globally consistent remuneration standards and a level playing field,\u201d HSBC said.",

      "bodyText": "Brakes, the London-based food supplier that had been considering a flotation, has been sold to US company Sysco in a deal worth $3.1bn (\u00a32.2bn). Brakes is majority owned by the private equity group Bain Capital, which took the company private for about \u00a31.3bn in 2007. Bain postponed a meeting with investors considered most likely to participate in an initial public offering for Brakes in the latter part of January, leading to speculation that another option was being given top priority. The IPO market has made a difficult start in London in 2016, with fewer deals getting off the ground, and those companies that have succeeded, such as CMC Markets and Clydesdale, only doing so at modest prices. Ken McMeikan, the Brakes chief executive, denied the group had ever entirely ruled out a float. He said he had been talking to potential IPO investors as recently as last Monday and that then \u201ca fantastic offer came in\u201d. The deal, which is expected to add to earnings immediately, includes the repayment of about $2.3bn of Brakes\u2019 debt, Sysco said. Brakes \u2013 which has operations in the UK, Ireland, France, Sweden, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg \u2013 will operate as a standalone company within Sysco. The combined company is expected to generate annualised sales of about $55bn. The Brakes business will continue to be led by McMeikan. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming Brakes, its 15,000 employees, and Ken McMeikan and his highly respected leadership team to the Sysco family of companies,\u201d said Bill DeLaney, Sysco\u2019s chief executive.

      "bodyText": "HSBC has admitted that an official monitor installed at the bank after a money-laundering scandal four years ago has raised \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about the slow pace of change to its procedures to combat crime. As Britain\u2019s biggest bank reported profits of \u00a313.2bn ($18.8bn) for 2015 and a \u00a37.3m pay deal for its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, it also published a string of legal disclosures which included an investigation by US regulators over its hiring of individuals with links to government officials in Asia, known as \u201cprincelings\u201d. The bank said that in a report it received in January the monitor installed by the US Department of Justice had highlighted the slow pace of progress on changes required to avoid a rerun of the 2012 scandal, for which it was fined \u00a31.2bn. The bank said the monitor had \u201cexpressed significant concerns about the pace of that progress, instances of potential financial crime and systems and controls deficiencies, whether HSBC is on track to meet its goal to the monitor\u2019s satisfaction within the five-year period of the US deferred prosecution agreement and, pending further review and discussion with HSBC, did not certify as to HSBC\u2019s implementation of and adherence to remedial measures specified in the US DPA\u201d. Gulliver defended the bank by indicating the scale of the task of monitoring 47 million customers in 71 countries, and said the number of compliance staff had increased from 1,600 to 9,000 over five years. In its 502-page report detailing profits for 2015, the bank included a reference to an investigation by the securities and exchange commission in the US to hiring of the children or younger relatives of China\u2019s political leaders or of powerful executives at state-owned enterprises. Other banks are also being investigated over such concerns. Among the other matters were ongoing litigation involving the collapse of the investments by Bernard Madoff, litigation dating to the subprime mortgage crisis in the US, and investigations into the world football governing body, Fifa. The bank said it was continuing to cooperate with investigations into tax practices at its Swiss arm which were exposed by the Guardian and other publications and described by Gulliver at the time of last year\u2019s results as \u201ca source of shame\u201d. Kicking off the UK banking reporting season in one of the most febrile environments for the sector since the 2008 crisis, HSBC said its full-year profits were up just 1%. In the fourth quarter of 2015 it made an unexpected loss. The shares were down almost 2% in late London trading on Monday even though the bank raised its dividend to $0.51 from $0.50, a total payout of $10bn for shareholders. The 4% rise in the total dividend compared with a 2% fall in total employee pay of $20.3bn, the bank said. Gulliver said he was running the bank on the assumption that interest rates would not rise in 2016, making it harder to boost profits. Concerns about the impact of continued low or negative interest rates imposed by central banks have hammered confidence in bank shares since the start of the year. Chairman Douglas Flint said the bank had been operating amid \u201cseismic shifts in global economic conditions\u201d, pointing to sharp falls in prices for oil and other commodities, partly stemming from slowing growth in China. Plans to hire 4,000 staff in China over four years have been extended to five years, although Gulliver is pressing on with a plan to axe 25,000 jobs in other parts of the operation. In an attempt to quell lingering investor concerns about the impact of $30 a barrel oil on loans to oil and gas companies, HSBC revealed it had exposure of $29bn and had taken a charge of just $400m against losses. To put that into perspective, the bank said it had $106bn of subprime loans before the 2008 banking crisis. About $4.5bn (\u00a33.2bn) \u2013 up from $4bn a year ago \u2013 has been set aside to cover investigations into tax-related matters and foreign exchange manipulation, as well as a court case involving its US arm, and compensation for payment protection insurance (PPI). The provision for PPI misselling increased by $549m during the year. Other banks reporting in the coming days are also expected to increase their provisions. Last week, HSBC ended a nine-month review of whether it should remain headquartered in the UK, and concluded it would stay put. The UK government appears in recent months to have cut back on \u201cbashing\u201d bankers and reduced a bank levy calculated on the size of balance sheets, which cost HSBC $1.5bn last year and $1.1bn the year before. Flint said: \u201cIt is too early to say whether this amounts to a new understanding between the industry and the public, but it is encouraging that the industry is once again gaining a voice at a time of great economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A vote to leave the EU in June\u2019s referendum will threaten the UK\u2019s strong credit score, potentially pushing up the cost of government borrowing, the ratings agency Moody\u2019s has warned. On Monday the pound tumbled on growing fears of a Brexit, hitting a seven-year low against the US dollar and also weakened against other big currencies as investors pulled money out of UK assets. Currency experts said London mayor Boris Johnson coming out for the leave campaign intensified pressure on sterling. Moody\u2019s, which assigns scores to governments\u2019 creditworthiness, said a new EU deal reached by prime minister David Cameron would help to alleviate some uncertainty around Brexit but that the outcome of the 23 June referendum \u201cremains too close to call\u201d. In the event of a vote to leave the EU, the economic costs would outweigh the benefits, Moody\u2019s said. Exports would likely suffer, as would investment, and policymakers would get tied up in lengthy renegotiations of the UK\u2019s trade relations. \u201cWe consider it positive that the referendum will take place as soon as June, as a lengthy period of uncertainty on the part of firms and investors would damage the UK\u2019s economic growth prospects. That said, the outcome of the referendum remains wide open. In our view, a decision to leave the EU would be credit negative for the UK economy,\u201d said Kathrin Muehlbronner at Moody\u2019s. Moody\u2019s currently rates the UK Aa1, one notch below the top triple-A score. The agency said that if the public vote to leave the EU, it would consider assigning a \u201cnegative outlook\u201d to that rating, compared with a \u201cstable\u201d outlook now. Such an outlook would imply a greater chance of a downgrade to the Aa1 rating in the future. The warning follows comments in December from rival agency Fitch that a vote to leave could hurt the UK\u2019s credit score. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, the only big ratings agency still giving Britain the top ranking, has also flagged risks from the referendum to the UK\u2019s financial services sector, its exports, and the wider economy. Economists have said that even before the referendum outcome is known, the UK\u2019s growth prospects could be hit by the uncertainty. Such fears were reflected on financial markets, where sterling hit a seven-year low of $1.4067, down 2.3% on the day, putting it on track for its biggest one-day fall since early 2009. Economists at investment bank Citi raised the probability of Brexit from 20-30% to 30-40% after Johnson and the justice secretary, Michael Gove, announced their support for the leave campaign. \u201cSo far, polls still suggest that the UK is more likely to vote to stay in the EU than to leave, and indeed \u2018remain\u2019 is still our base case scenario. We expect the campaign between now and June to shift the debate from the nature of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU to the economic and political risks of Brexit,\u201d Citi economists Tina Fordham and Michael Saunders wrote in a research note. \u201cHaving said that, following the decision of credible and popular leaders like Johnson and Gove to back the out campaign, we now increase the probability that the UK votes for Brexit.\u201d With the referendum date now confirmed, traders warned that the pound is set for four months of volatile trading. Opinion polls are tight and financial markets are also wary of reading too much into a slim lead for the remain campaign after misleading signals from such polls in the run-up to last year\u2019s UK general election. \u201cMarkets are likely to become increasingly nervous on the issue, and lack confidence in polling data following the margin of failure to predict the UK general election 2015 outcome by a wide margin,\u201d said Fordham and Saunders. Bill O\u2019Neill, head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, also warned of choppy markets ahead. \u201cWe expect UK markets to be volatile over coming days as the campaigns step up a gear and investors adjust to the prospect of a referendum four months from now, but our base case remains that the UK population will decide to remain in the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cOur Brexit probability remains at 30% as we monitor the public response to the agreement with other EU members.\u201d The chairman of Britain\u2019s biggest bank, HSBC, also highlighted a \u201cheightened risk of uncertainty\u201d from a vote to leave the EU. Speaking as the bank reported a small rise in 2015 profits on Monday, Douglas Flint commented: \u201cEvery business in the UK would be reviewing its supply chain, legal agreements and its licences.\u201d He said the UK had a disproportionately large number of companies headquartered here and \u201cthat period of uncertainty would be very damaging\u201d. The bank has already said that the referendum or any vote to leave would not make it revisit its decision to remain headquartered in London, where it has been based since 1992. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver said that the broad impact on the UK would come from the fact that the EU is the country\u2019s largest trading partner. But Gulliver said he did not expect London\u2019s predominance as a foreign exchange trading market to be damaged.",

It is understood that more than half of Britain\u2019s leading companies have put their name to a letter to be published on Tuesday backing a referendum vote to remain in the EU. But the supermarket chains, which declined to back either side ahead of the Scottish referendum, said the choice over whether to continue belonging to the EU was one for the British people. The decision to write a joint letter in support of staying in the EU follows the announcement at the weekend by David Cameron that the government will set a 23 June date for a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. The prime minister said he named the date after concluding negotiations on a new settlement with the other 27 members of the bloc. Cameron said his focus on expanding the single market and stemming the tide of regulations would support jobs and growth. He also stressed that Britain could put a brake on plans for it to be part of an ever-closer union following his agreement with EU leaders. It is believed the boards of all three supermarket chains were unwilling to upset shoppers who will vote on whether to regain independence after more than 40 years of EU membership. This concern is not expected to stop others among the UK\u2019s top companies, including HSBC and Virgin, from supporting the campaign to maintain EU membership, alongside British multinationals Shell, BAE Systems, BT and mining firm Rio Tinto. Tesco said in a statement: \u201cThe referendum on EU membership is a decision for the people of Britain. Whatever that decision is, our focus will continue to be on serving customers.\u201d A spokeswoman for Sainsbury\u2019s said it was an \u201capolitical organisation\u201d and the vote on Europe was a \u201cmatter for the British people\u201d. This policy was broken by Sainsbury\u2019s former chief executive, Justin King, who was a few months from quitting the business in 2014 when he said an independent Scotland would pay more for its groceries. Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Tesco have all concluded that backing a vote to stay in the EU could deter customers, despite having built different retail operations. Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons only operate in the UK, while Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest retailer, has established itself as a leading business overseas. Tesco is one of the largest supermarket chains in Ireland and is heavily involved in eastern Europe. It has stores in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary \u2013 all of which are EU countries. It also has stores in Turkey, China and across east Asia.",

      "bodyText": "A revival at Primark helped Associated British Foods (ABF) report improved trading as the budget fashion chain recovered from falling pre-Christmas sales caused by warm weather. Primark was a surprise loser among UK retailers over Christmas as sales at core UK stores fell for the first time in nine years. The warmest December on record gave shoppers little incentive to buy winter coats and jumpers and stores were unusually quiet before Christmas. In a trading update, Primark\u2019s parent, ABF, said business had picked up at the chain in the new year and that it expected first-half sales to be level with a year earlier. Improved trading at ABF\u2019s sugar business and more favourable currency movements also contributed to a statement that the company said would increase confidence in its prospects. John Bason, ABF\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cI think people have found this [statement] very reassuring. With Primark we were talking about the weather back in the autumn. This now shows very clearly that trading has picked up in January and February.\u201d ABF\u2019s results have been affected by the falling price of sugar and the strength of the pound against the euro. Bason said the sugar business had reached a turning point after prices increased in the EU and China as a glut of stock eased. Sterling\u2019s recent weakness against the euro is good for ABF, which reduced its estimate of currency impact for this year to \u00a310m from \u00a325m, he added. ABF shares rose 1.4% to \u00a333.02 after the trading update. Bason declined to discuss the referendum on EU membership, announced by the prime minister for 23 June. He said the group, which has expansion plans in Europe, had kept out of the debate until now and was not going to change its policy. Bason said: \u201cAssociated British Foods is a very international group and we operate in 48 countries so we are very, very international and we are used to operating in lots of jurisdictions.\u201d The company, which also owns Kingsmill bread, Patak\u2019s pickles and other food brands, said it expected a marginal fall in earnings per share for the year that ends in August. It had previously said earnings would suffer a \u201cmodest\u201d decline and analysts took the change in wording as a good sign. Primark launched in the US in September by opening a store in Boston that it followed with another near Philadelphia. Bason said six more US shops would open this calendar year and that Primark would open a 70,000 sq ft store in the American Dream mall in New Jersey in 2017. He said at the Boston store, \u201clunchtime, evenings and weekends are very, very busy. People by and large in the eastern part of the US are wearing the same things that people wear in Europe. People love the breadth of the range and the pricing. That is the key because in the US market you have to stand out.\u201d He said Primark would keep working on its ranges while opening new stores in the east of the US before expanding to other regions.",

      "bodyText": "Fears that Britain may leave the EU may be knocking the pound lower but shares are shrugging off theses worries as commodity prices support the market. Oil continues its volatile way, up more than 2% at $33.72 in the wake of last week\u2019s attempts by producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia to limit output. Metal prices also moved higher, with copper hitting a two week high as the head of China\u2019s securities regulator resigned and positive signs from the country\u2019s steel industry. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: [Metal prices are] benefiting from bets that oversupply will begin to reduce as well as a return of risk-on appetite. There is also perhaps optimism that soft China Business sentiment will result in more stimulus from Beijing and that the nation\u2019s new securities regulator will grease the wheels of the IPO market and get Chinese equities further from their recent lows, recovering lost ground not just this year, but since last summer. So the FTSE 100, dominated as it is by global rather than domestic issues, is up 69.43 points at 6019.66. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: The pound has slumped as a result [of Brexit fears] and although this might be bad news for holiday markets, it should be good for exporters and will also serve to buoy London-listed equities in general as sterling denominated assets begin to look a little cheaper to overseas investors. Anglo American is leading the way higher, up 31.35p at 468p as analysts at both Macquarie and Jefferies raised their price targets, albeit with underperform ratings. Jefferies said there were risks to Anglo\u2019s share price after the recent rally and added: A successful transformation for Anglo depends on a combination of asset sales and cost cutting. We are concerned that demand for higher cost assets - especially in bulk commodities - will be weak, and buyers will only be interested if assets will be sold at low valuations. Anglo is therefore likely to struggle to complete its planned $3-4bn of divestments in 2016 and $7bn plus of divestments in the longer term. If management succeeds, the Anglo share price would likely have further upside, even after the recent rally. If we assume $2.5bn of core EBITDA at spot, an enterprise value/EBITDA multiple of 8 times (reasonable for world class mining assets at a very weak point in the cycle), and net debt of $6bn, Anglo\u2019s equity value would be 746p a share. It really comes down to whether these aggressive restructuring targets are met. In the near-term, we think Anglo\u2019s share price depends on whether management can convince investors these plans are credible. In the longer term, Anglo\u2019s share price depends on whether these plans are actually achieved. BHP Billiton is 42.9p better at 775.3p while Rio Tinto has risen 102.5p at \u00a319.94. But HSBC is the biggest faller, down 4% at 431.95p after its results. Among the mid-caps Home Retail has jumped 18.9p to 172.5p after South Africa\u2019s Steinhoff made a rival bid to Sainsbury\u2019s, down 5.1p at 256p on fears it could become involved in an auction. Bovis Homes is up 1.5p at 912p after its full year profits rose 20% to a record \u00a3160.1m. But it made some cautious comments on the outlook, and other housebuilders have slipped back, with Berkeley down 86p at \u00a332.77 and Barratt Developments 8.5p lower at 576p.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in Argos owner Home Retail group jumped 12% on Monday after the emergence of a \u00a31.4bn rival offer from South African retail group, Steinhoff. The increase took the shares to 172p, just below the 175p terms proposed by Steinhoff, announced after the stock market had closed on Friday. The Sainsbury\u2019s offer, worth 167p a share, values Home Retail at \u00a31.35bn. Sainsbury\u2019s is expected to ask for an extension of the Tuesday deadline to table a firm bid for the owner of Argos. The request for more time from the Takeover Panel would come from Sainsbury\u2019s with the agreement of Argos\u2019s parent, Home Retail Group (HRG), and would likely propose 18 March, the same date for Steinhoff to make a firm bid. If the Takeover Panel did not grant an extension then Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, will be forced to either raise his \u00a31.3bn cash and shares offer \u2013 which some analysts expect \u2013 or walk away. But the aggressive South African company is a serious rival for HRG because it already owns Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK plus Conforama in France as well as discount chains in Africa and Australasia. Sainsbury\u2019s is hemmed in by promises not to overpay for the owner of Argos but also because Coupe does not want to see a deal, which would bring together both of their small electrical businesses, slip through his hands. The grocer was unwilling to comment on what its next move would be, but one retail industry figure said he was convinced Sainsbury would push for an extension. \u201cIt is in the interests of (HRG) to allow Sainsbury\u2019s and Steinhoff to bid against each other so you have to think they will both agree to go and ask for that extension while due diligence continues.\u201d The process could be complicated for Sainsbury\u2019s amid speculation that a tie-up with Argos\u2019s owner would trigger a lengthy assessment by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). \u201cA prolonged inquiry always creates some jeopardy for listed transactions, in particular when the trading environment can change\u201d, Alec Burnside, a competition lawyer told the Sunday Telegraph. \u201cWhile the inquiry is running, there\u2019s the concern that the uncertainty will worry staff, suppliers, shareholders and customers\u201d. Some analysts have already predicted Sainsbury\u2019s will just increase its offer. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, has said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s might be keen to avoid a bidding war, but we would expect them to match the Steinhoff bid, and hope that the fact they are further down the line on due diligence will mean the board will accept their offer.\u201d",

Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, has said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s might be keen to avoid a bidding war, but we would expect them to match the Steinhoff bid, and hope that the fact they are further down the line on due diligence will mean the board will accept their offer.\u201d<br></p>",

In a report into the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) published on Monday, the Treasury select committee found that words such as \u201ctopslice\u201d to describe spending cuts were removed \u2013 although concluded that in the end this did not change the analysis of the economic situation. It also published emails showing that the office of the then-chief secretary (Danny Alexander) suggested non-factual changes to the economic and fiscal outlook in December 2014, although these were not adopted. The OBR was formally created after the May 2010 general election to provide independent economic forecasts and it is chaired by the economist Robert Chote. The Treasury is able to provide factual responses to the data being published but, according to a memorandum of understanding (MOU), is not allowed to influence the body in any other way. The report by the influential committee of MPs also questions whether a review into whether the OBR should assess tax and spending pledges made in manifestos issued in the run-up to elections was independent. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cIt is clear that the chief secretary made requests for non-factual changes to be made to the economic and fiscal outlook. This looks like a misjudgement. It gives the appearance of a minister trying to lean on the OBR. The OBR\u2019s independence is hard-earned and easily squandered\u201d. He said that while \u201clittle or no damage\u201d appears to have taken place, the MOU needed to be updated: \u201cThis should make crystal clear that early sight of the OBR\u2019s work is for fact-checking and quality assurance purposes only.\u201d Chote, who is in his second term at the OBR, had said he was capable of telling Treasury officials to \u201cbuzz off\u201d at a hearing of the Treasury committee which had raised questions about the correspondence after they were obtained by the Times through a freedom of information request. Chote had said at the time that the Treasury \u201cknow very well that we write what we like and if they want to offer views on that we are robust to it and will say what we want. I feel entirely relaxed about it\u201d. The OBR could not be reached for comment but the Treasury said: \u201cIn establishing the OBR in 2010, independence and transparency was introduced to economic and fiscal forecasting process for the first time ever, with clear safeguards established to make sure this is protected. Officials and ministers have acted entirely properly, respecting that independence, at all times. We will respond formally to this report in due course.\u201d\u200e According to the MPs\u2019 report a number of Treasury requests for non-factual changes appear to have been taken on board by the OBR, although emails published by the select committee do not show who sent these requests. \u201cThe removal of words such as \u2018topslice\u2019 to describe spending cuts, and \u2018complicated\u2019 to describe the then government\u2019s fiscal assumption, cannot be held to have improved the clarity of the economic and fiscal outlook, nor did they make it more factually accurate,\u201d the report said. \u201cNonetheless, the committee is satisfied that, on this occasion, the changes the OBR made in response to Treasury requests made no material difference to the analysis contained in the final document.

      "bodyText": "The controversial transatlantic trade deal set to be agreed this year would mean that privatisation of elements of the NHS could be made irreversible for future governments wanting to restore services to public hands, according to a new legal analysis. The legal advice was prepared by one of the UK\u2019s leading QCs on European law for the Unite trade union, which will reveal on Monday that it has been holding talks with the government about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal between Europe and the US. Unite believes the government has been keeping Britain in the dark over the impact of the deal and argues the NHS should be excluded from the trade deal. The government dismissed the idea that TTIP poses a threat as \u201cirresponsible and false\u201d. TTIP would give investors new legal rights, which extend beyond both UK and EU law as well as NHS contracts, according to Michael Bowsher QC, a former chair of the Bar Council\u2019s EU law committee who was tasked by Unite to prepare the advice. Bowsher said he had concluded that the deal poses \u201ca real and serious risk\u201d to future UK government decision making regarding the NHS. \u201cWe consider that the solution to the problems TTIP poses to the NHS \u2013 and which is likely to provide the greatest protection \u2013 is for the NHS to be excluded from the agreement by way of a blanket exception contained within the main text of TTIP,\u201d Bowsher said. In the most explicit warning from a figure of prominence about the potential threat to the NHS from the deal \u2013 which may yet prove a rallying point for leftwing out campaigners in the EU referendum \u2013 he also warned that it could allow private companies with links to NHS contracts to win higher levels of compensation through bypassing domestic courts. He also said that TTIP\u2019s procurement rules could force the NHS to contract out services it wants to keep in house or spin off them off as \u201cmutuals\u201d Unite, which has already held a series of high-level meetings with officials from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and with the minister for trade, Francis Maude, will present Bowsher\u2019s advice to the government on Tuesday. Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Gail Cartmail, said: \u201cThe UK government has no right to allow EU bureaucrats to negotiate away our ability to control the future of our NHS. David Cameron has the power to exclude the NHS from the trade deal \u2013 he must act and prevent the irreversible sale of our NHS. Campaigners have already accused the government of blocking access to legal advice showing its impact on the health service and the extent to which private health companies could sue the government using a secret tribunal system if a Whitehall policy change were to hit their profits. Unite said that Maude has admitted to having legal advice concerning the TTIP\u2019s potential impact on the NHS but has blocked a freedom of information request to obtain the advice, citing \u201clegal professional privilege\u201d. A BIS spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS is under no threat whatsoever from the TTIP deal or any other trade and investment agreement. It cannot force the UK to privatise public services or prevent it from regulating in the public interest and any suggestion to the contrary is both irresponsible and false. \u201cIt will remain up to the UK government and devolved administrations to decide how to run publicly funded health services, including whether private companies should be involved. Where a service has previously been provided by a private provider, this is not irreversible.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Claims about the economic effect of ending sand mining on Queensland\u2019s North Stradbroke Island are \u201cmisguided\u201d because the island has \u201cno economy of its own\u201d, a report from the Australia Institute has found. The Palaszczuk government\u2019s attempt to pass laws closing most operations by the Belgian miner Sibelco by 2019 hangs in the balance amid concerns by crossbench MPs about the impact of job losses. Among those who support the end of mining on the island, also known as Minjerribah, are the traditional owners the Quandamooka people, whose native title rights are suppressed while Sibelco\u2019s mining leases are in force. However, the Labor-aligned Australian Workers Union has swung its support behind an alternative bill by Katter\u2019s Australian party MPs to delay the mining end date to 2024 to allow more time for the island to \u201ctransition\u201d. Their concerns are shared by the independent MP Billy Gordon, whose support the government would need to have its bill passed. The chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council, Michael Roche, said in December it was \u201cdifficult to fathom\u201d the government\u2019s bid to \u201cbring to a premature end nearly 230 mining jobs on North Stradbroke Island and at the nearby processing plant\u201d given concerns about similar job losses at Clive Palmer\u2019s Townsville nickel plant. Roche accused the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of planning to \u201cwipe out these jobs to appease a noisy few\u201d. But the Australia Institute report argues those concerns are a \u201csandstorm in a teacup\u201d. Such claims were \u201cwildly exaggerated\u201d, the institute\u2019s director of research, Rod Campbell, said. In fact, he said, thsae end of mining would have \u201cminimal or positive impact\u201d on most island stakeholders \u2013 holiday home owners who do not live there. They would benefit if more of the island and its natural attractions became accessible \u2013 a point argued by the environment minister, Steven Miles, when last month Sibelco refused him access for a fifth time to travel through a mining lease area to visit a national park with media. The Quandamooka people also support the end of mining leases in 2019, having launched a high court challenge to the former Newman government\u2019s laws allowing Sibelco to extend its leases until 2035. After the election of the former premier Campbell Newman, it emerged that Sibelco had spent about $1m backing his campaign over his Labor predecessor, Anna Bligh, who moved to wind up most of its North Stradbroke mining by 2019. Notes to the Palaszczuk government bill to end North Stradbroke mining stated that the Quandamooka\u2019s relationship with the island \u201cdates back thousands of years and as such the island is rich in their traditional culture\u201d. \u201cArchaeological sites show evidence of generations of the Quandamooka people using the island and the rich surrounding waters for food, work and recreation,\u201d they said. Campbell said phasing out mining would affect about 100 Sibelco employees living on the island \u2013 about 5% of the population \u2013 but the government\u2019s proposed $20m transition strategy suggested about 50 jobs would be created in mine rehabilitation. He said claims by the federal government MP Andrew Laming that an end to mining would \u201cdecimate house prices\u201d did not stack up given 55% of houses were owned by non-residents who \u201cinvest substantial amounts of money on [the island] but work elsewhere\u201d. \u201cThese are mainly holiday homes taking advantage of the area\u2019s natural beauty, laid-back atmosphere and easy access from Brisbane,\u201d he said. Campbell said of those living on the island, 1,200 were \u201colder and are not in the workforce by choice\u201d. \u201cIn discussion of the end of mining on the island, it has often been claimed by mining advocates that the North Stradbroke Island (NSI) economy is \u2018dependent\u2019 on mining,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is misguided, as NSI has no economy of its own in the usual sense of the word \u2013 NSI is entirely integrated into the economy of south-east Queensland. \u201cMost important services are provided by the mainland, such as retail, health and education. \u201cSupermarkets deliver to the island, people go to the mainland for most health issues and all students commute to the mainland past year 7. \u201cWhile the phase out of mining may affect some mine workers, for the vast majority of NSI stakeholders there will be minimal or positive economic impact as larger parts of the island become accessible.\u201d Campbell questioned whether the government\u2019s proposal to spend $5m on a job transition strategy for 100 island-based Sibelco workers was appropriate given the relatively small number of jobs. Both the government bill and the Katter alternative remain under consideration by the Queensland parliamentary finance and administration committee before a report and likely votes on the floor of parliament.",

    "webTitle": "Scott Morrison's response to Labor's negative gearing plan is truly disturbing | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If nothing else, the release of Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy last week has seriously spooked the government. Gone is any sense of a rational adult debate of ideas. It took the prime minister less than a week to flick the hyperbole switch and declare the ALP plan will be virtual Armageddon for the housing market. Malcolm Turnbull didn\u2019t quite suggest that the residential housing market would be wiped off the map \u00e0 la the fate predicted for Whyalla under a carbon tax, but he went close. He told reporters on Friday that \u201cevery homeowner in Australia has a lot to fear from Bill Shorten\u201d. Clearly the government has done the maths and decided that as 66% of households either have a mortgage or own their house outright, that it is far better to scare them than try to appeal to the smaller numbers of prospective home owners. Turnbull\u2019s belief that removing negative gearing will \u201csmash the residential housing market\u201d is one echoed with glee by the treasurer, Scott Morrision. Both base their argument on the belief that removing negative gearing for established residences will mean \u2013 in Turnbull\u2019s words \u2013 taking out \u201call of the investors. So there will only be home buyers, people who are buying it as a residence\u201d. As a consequence Turnbull and Morrison argue that house prices will fall. It\u2019s a pretty silly argument that doesn\u2019t hold up under close examination. Even worse, it also suggests a pretty dismal assessment of the state of Australia\u2019s housing market. Are we to assume that the prime minister and the treasurer believe the value of Australian homes is reliant only on the ability of investors to use the system to avoid paying tax? If so, that\u2019s a pretty scary thought. It suggests that not only do the two top people in our government think the Australian housing market is some sort of tax-driven Ponzi scheme, but that they also want to make sure it stays that way. The position of Turnbull and Morrison is \u2013 in the words the PM used to attack Shorten \u2013 \u201cvery blunt, is very crude, it\u2019s totally political\u201d. For a start not all housing investors negative gear. Until John Howard introduced a 50% discount on capital gains tax in 1999 (which the ALP wants to reduce to 25%) about half of property investors negative geared, and half made profits from the rent they received. Now about two-thirds of investors negative gear: Turnbull suggests (correctly) that all investors account for about 30% of the market, but if we keep the third of current investors who don\u2019t negative gear, we\u2019re now down on his figures to only 20% of the market leaving. Turnbull notes that for those selling their house \u201cthere are homebuyers, there are young homebuyers, there are older homebuyers. And there\u2019s plenty of investors\u201d. But the \u201cplenty of investors\u201d is not the majority of buyers. You should not confuse reduced demand with no demand. And you should not confuse \u2013 or try to scare voters by suggesting it \u2013 that a lower growth of house prices means falling prices (let alone a smashing of them). But even if we accept Turnbull\u2019s story, it all gets a bit silly, because he only considers sellers and not buyers. He tells the sad tale of someone trying to sell their house, but what about the buyers in his story? And why are the people selling their house? Most people sell their home in order to buy bigger one \u2013 so they would in turn benefit from the lower prices as well. Turnbull\u2019s horror story works best if you only care about people who have bought a house purely to sell it for a profit. It would seem the government has gone from seeing only one side of the budget debate to now only observing one side of the housing market. But at least the Turnbull\u2019s argument was not as deluded as that put forward by his treasurer. Morrison told ABC\u2019s AM program last Thursday that the ALP\u2019s policy was so bad that it would turn houses into cars. He argued that, \u201cfor everyone else who owns property, the minute you put your key in the front door, your house turns from a new house to an old house, and it\u2019s a bit like driving the new car off the lot in terms of what it means for your assets. So, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve thought it through.\u201d Speaking of not thinking things through ... It\u2019s almost enough to make you ring up Joe Hockey and tell him to come home; all is forgiven. Morrison clearly thought it was a winning line because he used it again when talking to 3AW\u2019s Neil Mitchell on Friday. It is perhaps the most stupid line Morrison has uttered in his time as treasurer. In his eyes the real estate section will in the future contain \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cused\u201d homes for sale. Except houses are not at all like cars. A car declines in value once it is driven off the lot because there is an almost infinite supply of new cars and a strong competition from suppliers. If you want a new Toyota, you don\u2019t need to pray that some investor doesn\u2019t out bid you. All you have to do is go along to a dealer and buy it. The worst you will have to do is wait for them to bring in a car in the colour you want. Even so-called \u201climited editions\u201d are basically limited to as many as the dealer can sell. Cars\u2019 engines are finite \u2013 they don\u2019t run forever, thus a newer car has greater value \u2013 and each year a new model comes out with better fuel efficiency, better handling, and updated styling. And because of almost unlimited supply and strong competition, that new model will mostly be the same price as was the previous year\u2019s model. So if you want to sell a 2014 Camry, the only thing you have to offer someone who wants to buy a 2016 model Camry is a lower price. It\u2019s not like yours is the only Camry available to sell. And crucially it is not like yours is the only Camry for sale in the area. Yes houses do get old, but they can be repaired, repainted, remodelled, or the garden can be landscaped. Clearly, Morrison hasn\u2019t watched many episodes of The Block. Repainting a used car may improve its value over what you would have been able to sell it for, but it will never increase its value compared to what it was when you bought it. A mere look at house prices compared to cars over the past 10 years shows just how different a market we\u2019re talking: The average price of a residential property is 77% higher now than in 2005, whereas the price of a car is 9% lower than then. And crucially that is the price of a new car, not of a car you bought in 2003 and now wish to sell. And of course the overriding difference is when you buy a car, you don\u2019t own the land upon which the car drives. Yes the state of the house is important, but you don\u2019t need to have talked to too many real estate agents (or is that used-house sellers?) to know the importance of \u201clocation, location, location\u201d. Comparing the housing market to used cars is utterly stupid, and to do so repeatedly is almost enough to raise the question of whether Morrison is up to the job. It betrays an ignorance of supply and demand that would be laughable were it not coming from the man in charge of the nation\u2019s finances. Turnbull should leave the dopey fear campaigns to his predecessor, and Morrison should either learn the basics of economics or tell his boss to trade in his treasurer for a newer model.",

It took the prime minister less than a week to flick the hyperbole switch and declare the ALP plan will be virtual Armageddon for the housing market. Malcolm Turnbull didn\u2019t quite suggest that the residential housing market would be wiped off the map \u00e0 la <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jMHoEMwFNQ\">the fate predicted for Whyalla under a carbon tax</a>, but he went close.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jan/18/dont-get-too-excited-about-the-cooling-housing-market-the-cost-of-loans-is-skyrocketing\">Don't get too excited about the cooling housing market \u2013 the cost of loans is skyrocketing | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He <a href=\"http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2016-02-19/doortop\">told reporters</a> on Friday that \u201cevery homeowner in Australia has a lot to fear from Bill Shorten\u201d.</p> <p>Clearly the government has done the maths and decided that as 66% of households either have a mortgage or own their house outright, that it is far better to scare them than try to appeal to the smaller numbers of prospective home owners. </p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s belief that removing negative gearing will \u201csmash the residential housing market\u201d is one echoed with glee by the treasurer, Scott Morrision. </p> <p>Both base their argument on the belief that removing negative gearing for established residences will mean \u2013 in Turnbull\u2019s words \u2013 taking out \u201call of the investors. So there will only be home buyers, people who are buying it as a residence\u201d.</p> <p>As a consequence Turnbull and Morrison argue that house prices will fall. </p> <p>It\u2019s a pretty silly argument that doesn\u2019t hold up under close examination. Even worse, it also suggests a pretty dismal assessment of the state of Australia\u2019s housing market.</p> <p>Are we to assume that the prime minister and the treasurer believe the value of Australian homes is reliant only on the ability of investors to use the system to avoid paying tax?</p> <p>If so, that\u2019s a pretty scary thought. It suggests that not only do the two top people in our government think the Australian housing market is some sort of tax-driven Ponzi scheme, but that they also want to make sure it stays that way. </p> <p>The position of Turnbull and Morrison is \u2013 in the words the PM used to attack Shorten \u2013 \u201cvery blunt, is very crude, it\u2019s totally political\u201d.</p> <p>For a start not all housing investors negative gear. Until John Howard introduced a 50% discount on capital gains tax in 1999 (which the ALP wants to reduce to 25%) about half of property investors negative geared, and half made profits from the rent they received.</p> <p>Now about two-thirds of investors negative gear:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JYhyv/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Turnbull suggests (correctly) that all investors account for about 30% of the market, but if we keep the third of current investors who don\u2019t negative gear, we\u2019re now down on his figures to only 20% of the market leaving. </p> <p>Turnbull notes that for those selling their house \u201cthere are homebuyers, there are young homebuyers, there are older homebuyers. And there\u2019s plenty of investors\u201d.</p> <p>But the \u201cplenty of investors\u201d is not the majority of buyers. You should not confuse reduced demand with no demand. And you should not confuse \u2013 or try to scare voters by suggesting it \u2013 that a lower growth of house prices means falling prices (let alone a smashing of them). </p> <p>But even if we accept Turnbull\u2019s story, it all gets a bit silly, because he only considers sellers and not buyers. </p> <p>He tells the sad tale of someone trying to sell their house, but what about the buyers in his story? And why are the people selling their house? Most people sell their home in order to buy bigger one \u2013 so they would in turn benefit from the lower prices as well. </p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s horror story works best if you only care about people who have bought a house purely to sell it for a profit. </p> <p>It would seem the government has gone from seeing only one side of the budget debate to now only observing one side of the housing market. </p> <p>But at least the Turnbull\u2019s argument was not as deluded as that put forward by his treasurer. </p> <p>Morrison told ABC\u2019s AM program <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2016/s4408837.htm\">last Thursday</a> that the ALP\u2019s policy was so bad that it would turn houses into cars. </p> <p>He argued that, \u201cfor everyone else who owns property, the minute you put your key in the front door, your house turns from a new house to an old house, and it\u2019s a bit like driving the new car off the lot in terms of what it means for your assets. So, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve thought it through.\u201d </p> <p>Speaking of not thinking things through ... It\u2019s almost enough to make you ring up Joe Hockey and tell him to come home; all is forgiven.</p> <p>Morrison clearly thought it was a winning line because he used it again when talking to 3AW\u2019s Neil Mitchell <a href=\"http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/transcript/020-2016/\">on Friday</a>.</p> <p>It is perhaps the most stupid line Morrison has uttered in his time as treasurer. In his eyes the real estate section will in the future contain \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cused\u201d homes for sale.</p> <p>Except houses are not at all like cars. </p> <p>A car declines in value once it is driven off the lot because there is an almost infinite supply of new cars and a strong competition from suppliers. </p> <p>If you want a new Toyota, you don\u2019t need to pray that some investor doesn\u2019t out bid you. All you have to do is go along to a dealer and buy it. The worst you will have to do is wait for them to bring in a car in the colour you want. </p> <p>Even so-called \u201climited editions\u201d are basically limited to as many as the dealer can sell. </p> <p>Cars\u2019 engines are finite \u2013 they don\u2019t run forever, thus a newer car has greater value \u2013 and each year a new model comes out with better fuel efficiency, better handling, and updated styling. And because of almost unlimited supply and strong competition, that new model will mostly be the same price as was the previous year\u2019s model. </p> <p>So if you want to sell a 2014 Camry, the only thing you have to offer someone who wants to buy a 2016 model Camry is a lower price.
