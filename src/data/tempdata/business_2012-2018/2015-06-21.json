    "webTitle": "The innovators: the customised robotic hand you can print out at home", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As a teenage hobbyist building robots at home in Bristol, Joel Gibbard had a leftfield thought when pondering his next project. How would he continue to make models if he lost a hand? \u201cThe critical thing to me in continuing to play with robotics and tinker with making things was to use my hands. So I thought it would make sense to make a robotic hand so that in the event I ever lost one, I would continue to use that,\u201d he said. From that grim thought eight years ago, Gibbard has developed a robotic hand for amputees and people born without one - and he can produce the prosthesis for a fraction of the current market price for such a device by using a 3D printer. Once an image of the recipient\u2019s arm has been taken using a 3D scanning technique, the rigid \u201cbone\u201d structure of the hand \u2013 which is made of nylon \u2013 and the outer \u201cskin\u201d \u2013 which is made of a strong, rubbery plastic \u2013are printed together and can be run off overnight. The rest of the prosthesis is made up of steel cables that operate the fingers and react when sensors detect movements in the muscles on the arm. Gibbard, 25, first tinkered with the idea while studying robotics at Plymouth University, and he realised from the outset that price would be an impediment. \u201cYou had this technology which was really enabling and for many people incredibly life changing. But it was too expensive for anyone to afford, too expensive for the NHS to provide, and so people did not have access to it,\u201d he said. After leaving university, Gibbard mulled over the problem for a while and decided to try to solve it using a 3D printer, technology which by then becoming more affordable. After quitting his job, saving \u00a31,500 for a printer and moving back in with his parents, he started work on a prototype. When he shared the files for his initial models online, however, he realised it was not enough to give people blueprints because most people were not in a position to make their own. \u201cThe vision was the same in terms of providing amputees with low cost and accessible prosthetics, but the implementation changed a little bit because I wanted it to be a sustainable company where we could actually provide people with prosthetics and support them and keep developing the technology,\u201d he said. Last September saw the breakthrough for Open Bionics, the company Gibbard set up to commercialise his work, when an amputee fitted with a fully functional prototype was able to shake hands with his brother for the first time. The prosthesis, which weighs the same as a human hand, ais attached to muscles in the arm using medical electrodes. When the muscles in the arm are flexed, an electrical signal is given off which is picked up by the sensors that relay the movement to the robotic arm. The first movement Gibbard achieved was a simple clench. When the muscles are flexed, there is a slight delay before the hand reacts in order to avoid \u201cfalse positives\u201d in which it moves when it is not supposed to. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be holding a cup of tea and then it drops the tea, so you want to make sure you give it a certain amount of signal before it will respond,\u201d Gibbard said. The unit acts like a puppet, with solid fingers and flexible joints operated by pulleys that mirror the actions made by a hand. Each prosthesis is made up of two parts, the hand itself and the socket with which it is attached to the arm. A mirror image of the opposing hand is taken and then the prosthesis is shaped along the same lines. \u201cThat is quite important to amputees. They like it to be a part of them. It is not just a robotic hand, it\u2019s their robotic hand,\u201d Gibbard said. Open Bionics aims to have its first products on sale next year, becoming the latest entrant in the market for robotic or bionic hands.

      "body": "<p>As a teenage hobbyist building robots at home in Bristol, Joel Gibbard had a leftfield thought when pondering his next project. How would he continue to make models if he lost a hand?</p> <p>\u201cThe critical thing to me in continuing to play with robotics and tinker with making things was to use my hands. So I thought it would make sense to make a robotic hand so that in the event I ever lost one, I would continue to use that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>From that grim thought eight years ago, Gibbard has developed a robotic hand for amputees and people born without one - and he can produce the prosthesis for a fraction of the current market price for such a device by using a 3D printer.</p> <p>Once an image of the recipient\u2019s arm has been taken using a 3D scanning technique, the rigid \u201cbone\u201d structure of the hand \u2013 which is made of nylon \u2013 and the outer \u201cskin\u201d \u2013 which is made of a strong, rubbery plastic \u2013are printed together and can be run off overnight. </p> <p>The rest of the prosthesis is made up of steel cables that operate the fingers and react when sensors detect movements in the muscles on the arm.</p> <p>Gibbard, 25, first tinkered with the idea while studying robotics at Plymouth University, and he realised from the outset that price would be an impediment.</p> <p>\u201cYou had this technology which was really enabling and for many people incredibly life changing. But it was too expensive for anyone to afford, too expensive for the NHS to provide, and so people did not have access to it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>After leaving university, Gibbard mulled over the problem for a while and decided to try to solve it using a 3D printer, technology which by then becoming more affordable. After quitting his job, saving \u00a31,500 for a printer and moving back in with his parents, he started work on a prototype.</p> <p>When he shared the files for his initial models online, however, he realised it was not enough to give people blueprints because most people were not in a position to make their own.</p> <p>\u201cThe vision was the same in terms of providing amputees with low cost and accessible prosthetics, but the implementation changed a little bit because I wanted it to be a sustainable company where we could actually provide people with prosthetics and support them and keep developing the technology,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last September saw the breakthrough for Open Bionics, the company Gibbard set up to commercialise his work, when an amputee fitted with a fully functional prototype was able to shake hands with his brother for the first time. </p> <p>The prosthesis, which weighs the same as a human hand, ais attached to muscles in the arm using medical electrodes. When the muscles in the arm are flexed, an electrical signal is given off which is picked up by the sensors that relay the movement to the robotic arm. </p> <p>The first movement Gibbard achieved was a simple clench. When the muscles are flexed, there is a slight delay before the hand reacts in order to avoid \u201cfalse positives\u201d in which it moves when it is not supposed to.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be holding a cup of tea and then it drops the tea, so you want to make sure you give it a certain amount of signal before it will respond,\u201d Gibbard said. The unit acts like a puppet, with solid fingers and flexible joints operated by pulleys that mirror the actions made by a hand.</p> <p></p> <p> Each prosthesis is made up of two parts, the hand itself and the socket with which it is attached to the arm. A mirror image of the opposing hand is taken and then the prosthesis is shaped along the same lines.</p> <p>\u201cThat is quite important to amputees. They like it to be a part of them. It is not just <em>a</em> robotic hand, it\u2019s <em>their</em> robotic hand,\u201d Gibbard said.</p> <p>Open Bionics aims to have its first products on sale next year, becoming the latest entrant in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/16/uk-woman-ride-bike-first-time-worlds-most-lifelike-bionic-hand\">market for robotic or bionic hands</a>.

      "bodyText": "Christine Lagarde took time off last week from grappling with the Greek debt crisis to make a speech about inequality. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund chose a nautical metaphor first used by John F Kennedy. Back in the early 1960s, the then US president hailed economic growth as a rising tide that lifts all boats. That was no longer true, according to Lagarde. \u201cIn too many countries, economic growth has failed to lift these small boats, while the gorgeous yachts have been riding the waves and enjoying the wind in their sails,\u201d she said. \u201cIn too many cases, poor and middle-class households have come to realize that hard work and determination alone may not be enough to keep them afloat.\u201d This trend has been marked in the years since the Great Recession. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was some evidence that JFK\u2019s dictum still held true. Real wages for the poor and middle classes in the US and UK rose during a period of sustained economic growth, but the years since 2008 have been a lot tougher for everyone apart from those at the very top. This has accentuated the pattern in recent decades for the rich to get an ever bigger slice of the economic pie. Forty years ago, 8% of income went to the highest 1% of earners in the US. Today it is 20%. In the UK the figure has risen from 5% to 15%. IMF research released last week shows that there are economic downsides to inequality. Raising the income share of the poorest 20% of the population increases growth by as much as 0.38 percentage points over five years. By contrast, increasing the income share of the richest 20% by 1% decreases it by 0.08 percentage points. So much for trickle down. The IMF sketches out some of the reasons why inequality is bad for growth. Poor people tend to spend rather than save any additional income. If they see their incomes stagnate or fall, they have a tendency to borrow more, which can lead to a dangerous build-up in debt and eventually a financial crisis. The enhanced power of the elite could lead to under-investment in education, health and infrastructure, which boost productivity and disproportionately benefit the poor. Lagarde pointed to technological progress and globalisation as additional factors that were widening the earnings gap between higher and lower skilled workers, especially in the west. She added that these disparities were becoming baked in, with social mobility on the decrease. To get on in life, you had to live on the right side of the tracks, and according to Lagarde, that \u201cdidn\u2019t sound fair\u201d. The IMF\u2019s study of inequality contained a helpful chart showing that the Nordic countries tend to have the highest levels of equality and social mobility, while the US and the UK have the lowest. There is no trade off between the two. At this point, readers might be wondering whether this IMF has anything to do with the other IMF, the one that tells countries seeking financial help that they need to liberalise labour markets by cutting minimum wages and reducing the scope of collective bargaining; the one that demands cuts in public spending and insists that state assets should be privatised at every opportunity. They are indeed one and the same. The IMF that warns of the perils of inequality is the IMF that is demanding measures of Greece that will add to poverty and make inequality worse. One half of the fund \u2013 the economics team that comes up with the big-picture analysis \u2013 says one thing. It supports investment in education, an enhanced role for trade unions and higher taxes on the rich. The other half \u2013 the part that draws up the structural adjustment programmes \u2013 says something entirely different. But at least it has identified the problem. Its analysis is shared by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. Analysis, however, is only a start. Tackling inequality requires policies that will make a difference and the power to implement them. A new book by the economist Tony Atkinson gives the lie to the argument that in a global economy nothing can be done about inequality. He lists 15 separate proposals for the UK, including guaranteed public employment; a minimum wage set at the level of a living wage; a minimum inheritance when a child reaches adulthood; the creation of a sovereign wealth fund that would increase the net worth of the state by taking stakes in companies and property; a universal basic income; the replacement of council tax with a regularly updated and progressive property tax; a wealth tax; and a 65% top rate of income tax. Atkinson freely admits that his proposals are bold, but says boldness is required in order to return the UK to the levels of inequality that prevailed before 1980. It is not enough, he says, to tinker. \u201cMajor reforms are required, engaging all areas of economic and social policy\u201d. Labour\u2019s manifesto at the 2015 election fell well short of the boldness Atkinson demands. There was a pledge to raise the top rate of tax to 50%, but no wealth tax, no basic income, no reform of council tax, no national endowment for 18-year-olds, no sovereign wealth fund. Perhaps voters considered Ed Miliband to be tinkering, and would have looked more kindly on something stronger. Perhaps they liked the anti-inequality measures, but didn\u2019t trust Labour to run the economy in a way that would make them achievable. Maybe it is only Scottish voters who are up for a bit of boldness. Whatever the reason, Labour put inequality at the heart of its campaign and lost. That said, Miliband was asking the right sort of questions. Later this week, the government will release the 2013-14 poverty figures, the first to be affected by the full effects of the coalition\u2019s welfare reforms. They are unlikely to make pretty reading. Cuts to in-work benefits will form part of George Osborne\u2019s summer budget on 8 July. There is a vicious circle at work here. Inequality breeds instability, which leads to recession. Recession damages the public finances, which leads to government belt tightening. Austerity requires spending cuts that widen inequality, which in turn leads to slower growth and a greater reliance on debt. If not now then at some point, this vicious circle will have to be broken.",

      "bodyText": "When banking goes bad, everyone suffers: that is a lesson taxpayers up and down Britain have learned the hard way over the past seven years or so. But the latest evidence suggests that even when it\u2019s not collapsing into the arms of the state, a large finance sector is a debilitating drain on an economy. Catherine L Mann, twinkly-eyed chief economist for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, brought a harsh message to the heart of Europe\u2019s great financial centre last week: too much finance is bad for you. In 2009, Adair Turner, then chairman of the Financial Services Authority, caught the public mood in the aftermath of the crisis that had ripped through the world\u2019s financial markets when he called much of the activity carried out in the City of London and Canary Wharf \u201csocially useless\u201d. The OECD agrees. The thinktank has made a concerted effort to keep fomenting unorthodox economic debate in the wake of the crisis \u2013 despite secretary general Angel Gurr\u00eda\u2019s vocal enthusiasm for George Osborne\u2019s very orthodox austerity programme. Sifting through 50 years of data, its experts found that, in general, the larger a country\u2019s banking sector, the more slowly the economy grows and the worse inequality becomes. These findings echo recent research from the International Monetary Fund, which found that enlarging the financial sector is critically important for developing countries \u2013 if businesses can\u2019t get loans and households don\u2019t have bank accounts, economic progress is all but impossible. But beyond a certain point, too much \u201cfinancialisation\u201d, as the economists call it, can be counterproductive. The OECD\u2019s work \u2013 which would have seemed deeply heretical back in the days when Alan Greenspan was still a maestro and Gordon Brown was proudly opening Lehman Brothers\u2019 London headquarters \u2013 shows that even in the good times, finance is not just another sector of the economy, like car manufacturing or construction, whose growth should be celebrated. And neither is it just plumbing, allowing capital to flow to the most promising businesses. Large financial sectors, the OECD says, tend to create too much credit and direct too much of it to consumers, pumping up asset bubbles (in Britain\u2019s case, housing) instead of backing businesses and nurturing growth. So not only do its cadre of highly paid workers (who earn up to 40% more than those in comparable jobs in other sectors, the OECD found) widen inequality by their very existence, they also make investment decisions that exacerbate the imbalances that have long been a deep-seated problem for Britain\u2019s economy. So even when they\u2019re not trying to rig Libor, con customers or facilitate tax avoidance, it seems finance\u2019s finest minds are not all that great at what we might have hoped was their raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2013 putting capital to its best use. Mann proffered a range of specific policy solutions: tackling top pay by cracking down on bonuses; removing the tax advantages that can make risky leveraged takeovers more attractive than equity investments; and tougher measures to rein in the biggest banks, which despite regulators\u2019 efforts still benefit, she says, from an implicit state subsidy because they are too big to fail. But perhaps the most important insight in the OECD work is that \u2013 as Karel Williams and colleagues at Manchester\u2019s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change have long argued \u2013 the sheer size of Britain\u2019s banking sector fundamentally distorts its economic model, stoking what is now universally known as the \u201chousing crisis\u201d while failing to allocate sufficient capital to productive investment. As if on cue, the Bank of England published a mind-boggling \u201cmap\u201d of Britain\u2019s financial sector on Friday, pointing out that not only is the banking business extraordinarily concentrated, but \u201cthe UK financial system is bigger, relative to the size of the economy, than that of most other countries\u201d. UK GDP was \u00a31.8tn in 2014; the banks\u2019 balance sheets totalled \u00a320tn \u2013 more than 10 times as large. Yet as the OECD concluded: \u201cWhen the financial system is already well-developed, as has been the case in OECD economies for some time, further increases in its size usually slow long-term growth.\u201d When the Bank of England examined Britain\u2019s lamentably weak productivity record in its May inflation report, it suggested that low interest rates, which have prevented firms going bust in the wake of the crisis, may have temporarily \u201cimpaired the reallocation of resources to new or more dynamic companies with the potential to achieve higher productivity\u201d. But there may be a much longer-term and more fundamental misallocation of resources going on. Osborne will make boosting productivity a centrepiece of next month\u2019s budget, and we can expect a string of new announcements on infrastructure, skills and his cherished northern powerhouse. He\u2019s also likely to try to make good on manifesto promises to tackle the housing crisis. Yet these two deep-seated challenges could perhaps be traced back to the same source \u2013 the country\u2019s unwieldy financial sector. Since Osborne\u2019s party receives a large share of its funding from the City, however, don\u2019t expect to hear much about the Square Mile\u2019s baleful influence on Britain\u2019s economic life.",
