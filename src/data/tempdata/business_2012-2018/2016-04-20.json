      "bodyText": "Only 5% of Australian fashion companies know the origin of the raw materials used to manufacture their products and just 16% have fully traced their input supply chain, according to a new report. The report, released by Baptist World Aid Australia on Thursday, three days before the three-year anniversary of the Rana Plaza factory collapse that killed 1,137 garment workers in Bangladesh, assessed 87 companies on their manufacturing, supply, and workers\u2019 rights policies. It found that of the 87 companies, which represent more than 300 clothing brands, 78% had started tracing their input suppliers, a third could prove they were paying \u201csignificantly above\u201d minimum wage to a portion of workers in their final stage of production, and two-thirds were working to actively improve their relationships with suppliers. The companies were assessed on their policies, knowledge of suppliers, auditing practices and supplier relationships, and worker empowerment, and given a grade of between A and F. Seven companies received an A grade, led by fair trade companies Ekito and Audrey Blue, which were both graded A+. Inditex was given an A, followed by Adidas Group, Liminal Apparel, Patagonia and Rrepp, which all received an A-. Nine companies \u2013 Ally Fashion, Boohoo, Brand Collective, Factory X, General Pants, Pavement United Brands, Roger David, Seed Heritage and Voyager Distributing Co, were graded F. All were among the 22% of companies that the report\u2019s authors said did not engage with the assessment process. The average grade given was a C+. Gershon Nimbalker, one of the authors of the report and advocacy manager for Baptist World Age, said the results showed Australian companies had improved significantly since the non-profit\u2019s first annual report in 2013 but that the industry still had a long way to go. He said that was particularly the case in protecting workers who produce the raw materials used in garment manufacturing, which laboured under the worst conditions. \u201cOur biggest concerns is despite seeing substantial progress at the input factory worker level, at the fabric-mill level, they are the next-tier down and companies do not necessarily know about the conditions in those factories,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Nimbalker said he witnessed those conditions on a recent visit to an Indian fabric mill. \u201cWe watched girl after girl after girl that were working in horrible conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of them were in forced labour or bonded labour. Some of them had been working since they were 13 years old. Many of them were being paid below minimum wage.\u201d At the garment factory level, he said, international scrutiny since the Rana Plaza collapse had seen the minimum wage in Bangladesh increase by 87%, from just US$38 a month to US$71a month. \u201cCompanies are certainly concerned about their brand and their reputation and I think that is a big motivator,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening as fast as we would like it to happen but we are seeing some significant improvements now.\u201d David Giles-Kaye, chief executive of the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia, said the report showed an improvement, but said it was \u201cnever going to be a good result\u201d until all workers involved in the manufacture of clothes were paid a fair minimum wage \u2013 a change that he said required a concerted, combined effort on behalf of companies and governments alike. \u201cAt the grassroots, it\u2019s about making sure that the people making these clothes, whether they are at the first tier or second or third, are being paid a fair minimum wage,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Giles-Kaye said the industry also needed to do more to educate consumers so that they looked for \u2013 and if they couldn\u2019t find, demanded \u2013 transparent information from companies about where and how their clothes were manufactured. \u201cThen consumers will be demanding even more strongly that companies address these issues,\u201d he said. Nimbalker said the not infrequent occurrence of suppliers sub-contracting work for Australian companies to factories that do not meet the required standards, such as Rip Curl jackets being made from a North Korean factory, did not mitigate the company\u2019s responsibility. \u201cThis has been a well-known problem in the industry for a long time, that suppliers will sub-contract out, so you need to have strong systems in place,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "A Trump presidency would be \u201ccertain\u201d to cause substantial problems in relations with China and sink the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, Kim Beazley, the former Australian ambassador to the US has said. Beazley, also the former Australian Labor leader, made the comment at the Australian National University on Wednesday evening, appearing alongside US ambassador to Australia John Berry. Beazley warned that Donald Trump, if he won the Republican nomination and then the US presidency in November\u2019s election, would have to walk his policy positions back \u201c180 degrees if you\u2019re actually going to achieve the sort of outcomes that best suit American policy goals and standing in the world and provide the sort of assurances American allies would like\u201d. \u201cWere he to come back halfway, it would still be devastating. That\u2019s a serious matter, a matter of concern. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d necessarily be all that worried about it. He has no regard for [US] alliances at all,\u201d Beazley said. Trump had displayed hostility to sensible policy and relations in the Asian region, he said. America had provided a critical prop for Asian prosperity by being an importer of last resort, he said. \u201cTo walk away from that, the effect would be potentially quite devastating.\u201d Beazley, who tripped as he left the podium but quickly recovered, said the TPP would help lift millions out of poverty at no cost to US interests.. But Beazley warned if Trump won the presidency \u201cit is certain the TPP would not go through\u201d. \u201c[It is] certain there would be substantial problems in the relationship with China.\u201d Beazley said he had \u201cnever heard\u201d of Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisers despite the deep experience of many Republicans in that area. Berry suggested a successful presidential candidate could surround themselves with different advisers after an election. Beazley predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the presidential election, which he said would be a reassuring thought for Australians following the campaign. \u201cOf all candidates, should she win, she would be most likely to replicate in minds of friends and opponents of America what it has stood for traditionally\u201d, including a continued rebalance towards the Asian region. \u201cThat might be problematic were any of the other candidates to be elected.\u201d Beazley predicted Clinton would easily win support from voters who had preferred her opponent Bernie Sanders in the primary. \u201cIn the main they\u2019ll come out to support Clinton. For a Democrat, she\u2019s a very easy candidate to support, she\u2019s a centrist of the left understanding. She understands how left the left think \u2013 she thought once that way herself.\u201d Beazley said Sanders\u2019 campaign had dragged Clinton to the left but not so far as to inhibit her style of governing if she were elected. Berry warned that generalisations about the American polity could not be drawn from the primary race, in which Trump polled one third of the votes in Republican primaries which drew only 10 to 20% of the members of that party. \u201cTwo thirds of voters voted for one of the many other candidates on the Republican side,\u201d he said. \u201cBe careful not to judge the country on the [basis of] very polarised, ideological people with deep feelings on certain issues.\u201d Berry said if he could \u201cwave a magic wand\u201d and bring one element of the Australian electoral system to the US, it would be its mandatory voting system. \u201cWhy? Because the bulk of our population is smack in the middle. They believe the government does good work, and they want a government with integrity and honesty.\u201d He urged Australians not to form conclusions about the US polity until after the 8 November presidential election.",

    "webTitle": "Former Asic insider says Turnbull government's user-pays plan will backfire", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government\u2019s plans to shift the Australian Securities and Investments Commission onto a user-pays funding model will fail to fix the poor conduct plaguing the financial industry, a former Asic chief economist has warned. Economist Alex Erskine, who was Asic\u2019s chief economist between 2007 and 2013, has also warned the user-pays model will increase the likelihood that the regulator may be \u201ccaptured\u201d by the banks it is supposed to be regulating. The Turnbull government announced sweeping reforms to Asic on Wednesday, promising to boost the regulator\u2019s surveillance powers with a multimillion-dollar technological upgrade that will restore some of the funding stripped in Tony Abbott-era cuts. It also promised to appoint an extra commissioner to Asic with experience in the prosecution of financial crimes. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the reform package was a considered response to the problems plaguing the financial industry. He said it was better than the proposal from the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who has been calling for a royal commission following years of financial scandals inside Australia\u2019s banks. As part of the reform package, Morrison said funding for the regulator would shift to a \u201cuser-pays\u201d model \u2013 in which the institutions it regulates will be forced to pay for the ongoing cost of their regulation \u2013 so taxpayers don\u2019t have to fund its operations anymore. Steven Munchenberg, chief executive of the Australian Bankers Association, says he knows few details about the way the user-pays model will work. \u201cWe accept the model in principle, [but] obviously with these sorts of things the devil is in the detail,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been concerned about how it\u2019s going to apply, and it has always raised questions in our minds about well, if we\u2019re paying, how can we have a guarantee that the regulator will use those funds efficiently?\u201d He said was waiting, like everyone else, to hear more details from the government. And former Asic chief economist Alex Erskine said he was concerned the proposed model will increase the risk that the regulator may be \u2018captured\u2019 by the banks it is supposed to be regulating. \u201cIn the end you\u2019ll get deals between industry and Asic about where Asic\u2019s tolerance for regulatory enquiry is,\u201d Erskine said. \u201cI\u2019m not totally against the idea, in fact I can see some good reasons as to why you\u2019d want to do it, because at the moment some people who are causing regulatory problems are not being billed properly. \u201cBut if the government\u2019s [soon] going to be paying no part in Asic\u2019s costs then in the end the government\u2019s voice [over] Asic risks being reduced and industry\u2019s voice over Asic risks being increased,\u201d he said. Labor treasury spokesman Chris Bowen has criticised the government for its proposed changes to the regulator. \u201cThis is a plan to get Scott Morrison through an election, it\u2019s not a plan to make Australia\u2019s banks and financial system to work for every day consumers,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a plan to weed out bad practices and bad behaviour, it\u2019s a plan to hobble through an election.\u201d Bowen also criticised the plan to charge Australia\u2019s banks $121m to upgrade Asic\u2019s technological surveillance capabilities. \u201cWhen it comes to the levy that the government announced, Scott Morrison and the Liberals have always claimed that these levies will be passed onto consumers,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they said when Labor in government instituted a bank deposit levy, insisted that it will be passed onto consumers. \u201cScott Morrison said that he would get very, very cross with the banks if they passed it on.\u201d",

And has the commission, steeped in 12 years of conflict with Microsoft, got a problem with the entire US technology industry? In less exaggerated form, some US voices may make the argument. Vestager\u2019s latest inquiry, into alleged monopoly abuse of the Android operating system, is Brussels\u2019 second Google probe in 12 months. \u201cWe have no grudge against any company,\u201d says Vestager. \u201cWe have an obligation to look at whether behaviour is anti-competitive or an abuse of dominance.\u201d That\u2019s what you\u2019d expect her to say, of course. But she\u2019s surely correct: the complaint of anti-Americanism is a distraction, and it also seems plain wrong. Look at the ingredients of the latest inquiry. Google\u2019s Android operating system is installed on four out of five smartphones. The marketplace is enormous and important for consumers and businesses. We also know the power of pre-installed apps to reach into wallets \u2013 most of us are lazy and don\u2019t compare products. And we have learned that a search function that is \u201cfree\u201d to consumers can distort markets in ways that are not immediately obvious. Put those facts together and the potential for abuse clearly exists. Whether Google has in fact used devious or illegal tactics with Android will be settled by the evidence. All that can reasonably be guessed at the outset is that the investigation will roll on for years and generate lucrative employment for thousands of lawyers. But anti-American or anti-Google? No. It\u2019s just that the US is very good at producing large technology companies that rise to dominate important markets. It would be nice if there were more European rivals to complain about. Port Talbot is no place for a staff whip-round A word of advice to any Port Talbot steelworker who may be asked to contribute funds to a management buyout (MBO) attempt: make sure your head rules your heart. The idea that individuals could be asked to find up to \u00a310,000 to help fund a deal is alarming. The buyout plan was rejected by Tata on commercial grounds. Other potential backers may take a more optimistic view but any purchase would be high risk; it could hardly be otherwise. This is not suitable territory for a whip-round among non-management employees. In any case, such sums would be a pittance in the context of the required capital. If the financial backing exists, great; if it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t ask staff to risk any part of their savings. Let\u2019s hope Sir Terry Matthews, the Welsh billionaire helping the MBO consortium, appreciates the point. His hero status would evaporate in an instant if workers\u2019 cash were lost in a perilous adventure. If the government eventually ends up chipping in cash or loans to support an MBO \u2013 still a very big if \u2013 it should insist the \u00a310,000 idea is dropped immediately. A mixture of taxpayers\u2019 cash and steelworkers\u2019 life savings just isn\u2019t sensible. Shareholders are not holding back We\u2019ve seen shareholder rebellions over pay in the past \u2013 2012 was the last vintage crop \u2013 but one old-hand FTSE 100 chairman reports that something is different this time. First, fund managers are giving less feedback to pay committees on what they think. Second, unhappy institutional shareholders are no longer registering their disapproval with an abstention and are instead going straight to the \u201cagainst\u201d box. Both factors seemed to play a part at BP last Thursday. At the start of the week, the old company was braced for a 25% rebellion, not the 59% it got. And formal abstentions were few: just 464m votes versus 6.8bn against. The mining firm Anglo American holds its annual meeting on Thursday and the chief beef is the number of share options granted to executives at a price that may turn out to be the bottom of the commodities market. The whisper suggests a rebellion of about a third of Anglo shareholders. If the figure is higher, the mood has definitely changed. Fund managers\u2019 new behaviour \u2013 if that\u2019s what it is \u2013 makes life harder for boards but is very welcome. Companies\u2019 traditional pre-vote tactic of softening up fund managers behind the scenes was always an unedifying game of calling in favours. Better to get the decisions right at the outset. And, if fund managers have decided abstentions are a waste of time, it\u2019s about time. Votes like BP\u2019s last week are merely advisory. If you can\u2019t form a definite opinion in a poll that obliges a company to do precisely nothing, you don\u2019t deserve to be managing other people\u2019s money.",

He was born in 1943 at the Lydia Beynon maternity hospital \u2013 now on the site of Matthews\u2019 Celtic Manor resort, which hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010 and a Nato summit four years later. Matthews will always be the man who brought the Ryder Cup to Wales. He invested more than \u00a3150m to transform the site into one of the leading golf venues in Europe. When Celtic Manor hosted the biennial golf match between Europe and the US, it did not initially go to plan. Heavy rain in Wales disrupted proceedings, forcing the match to go into an unprecedented fourth day. However, a dramatic final day, when the Northern Irish golfer Graeme McDowell holed a late putt to win the cup for Europe, meant Matthews had no regrets. \u201cI had business colleagues from Canada and the United States and all over the world ringing me up to say how sorry they were about the weather,\u201d Matthews later recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018Are you kidding me? We got an extra day of global coverage for all the sponsors. Can you imagine signing up for an event as big as the Ryder Cup and getting 33% extra for free.\u2019\u201d Matthews is worth \u00a31.04bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List, making him the third-richest person in Wales and the 101st-richest in the UK. He made his fortune primarily through technology and telecoms. He has founded or funded more than 100 companies, making millions of pounds along the way by building them up and then selling them on. They include Mitel, which he sold to BT in the 1980s, and Newbridge Networks, which was bought by the French company Alcatel. Matthews trained as an apprentice at the Post Office research department in north London, which developed electronics and computers. He accepted a job offer to join Microsystems International in Canada, which has been his base ever since. Despite living in Canada, Matthews has regularly championed causes in south Wales, meaning his involvement in talks to rescue Port Talbot and Tata Steel UK is no surprise. The billionaire is chairman of the Swansea Bay City Region board, a partnership between local authorities and local business. In recent months Matthews has talked up the prospects of the controversial Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project and criticised the government for delays to the electrification of the rail line between Cardiff and Swansea. Matthews is therefore a powerful backer for the proposed management buyout of Tata Steel\u2019s UK business. Even if he decides not to put his own money into saving the steelworks, the businessman, who was knighted in 2001, has an enviable contact book of financiers on both sides of the Atlantic that could prove useful for Port Talbot.",

      "bodyText": "Harriet Tubman, the anti-slavery campaigner, is set to appear on the front of the $20 bill, becoming the first woman to be the face of a bill of US currency. The US Treasury Department announced the news on Wednesday after a long, public and sometimes heated consultation period. The Treasury had reportedly considered letting Tubman bump founding father Alexander Hamilton, who has been on the $10 bill since 1928. Instead, she will take Andrew Jackson\u2019s spot on the $20 bill. \u201cWhen I announced last June that a newly redesigned $10 note would feature a woman, I hoped to encourage a national conversation about women in our democracy. The response has been powerful,\u201d US Treasury secretary Jack Lew said in a statement. \u201cThe decision to put Harriet Tubman on the new $20 was driven by thousands of responses we received from Americans young and old.\u201d Details of the redesign of the three bills \u2013 $5, $10 and $20 \u2013 were announced in a Medium post written by Lew. The Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, said: \u201cThroughout American history, women have made important contributions to the free and democratic society we enjoy today. I welcome the decision by the Treasury Department to honor these achievements.\u201d Jackson is not disappearing from the $20 bill altogether. \u201cThe reverse of the new $20 will continue to feature the White House as well as an image of President Andrew Jackson,\u201d Lew added. Even before the US Treasury decided to put Tubman on the $20, she had won the people\u2019s vote. A year ago, the not-for-profit group Women on 20s held a vote to choose a woman who could replace Jackson. Tubman won with 118,328 votes, beating out a Native American tribe leader, Wilma Mankiller, the former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and the civil rights activist Rosa Parks. Tubman, who was born into slavery, is best known for her role on the Underground Railroad. Making 19 trips over the course of 10 years, she helped free more than 300 slaves. She died in 1913, seven years before US women won the right to vote. The $5 and $10 bills will also undergo some changes. \u201cWhen we started this conversation not quite a year ago, it wasn\u2019t clear to me that millions of Americans were going to weigh in with their ideas,\u201d Lew told CNBC. \u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about one bill. We\u2019re talking about the $5, the $10 and the $20. We\u2019re not just talking about one picture on one bill. We\u2019re talking about using the front and the back of the bill to tell an exciting set of stories.\u201d While the $5 bill will be changed to depict civil rights era leaders, the back of the $10 bill will now bear a mural-style depiction of the women\u2019s suffrage movement. Originally, Lew hoped to replace Hamilton with Susan B Anthony, according to a memo obtained by the Wall Street Journal. Anthony will now appear on the back of the bill instead. Anthony previously appeared on a $1 coin. First lady Martha Washington previously appeared on a special $1 certificate. The other woman to appear on a bill was Pocahontas, who appeared on the back of a $20 bill. Tubman will be the first woman to appear as the main figure on the front of a bill. The Treasury hopes to unveil the newly redesigned bill by 2020, a year that will mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment, which granted women the right to vote. All about the Hamiltons Lew changed his mind after the initial plan to take Hamilton off the $10 bill met with public resistance. Among those objecting the removal of the first US treasury secretary was Lin-Manuel Miranda, the author and star of the Broadway musical Hamilton. After Lew attended the show last summer, Miranda tweeted that he had made his case. The two met again in March. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be very happy,\u201d Miranda said Lew told him at the time. Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chair, also voiced his displeasure with the idea of replacing Hamilton. \u201cHamilton\u2019s demotion is intended to make room to honor a deserving woman on the face of our currency. That\u2019s a fine idea, but it shouldn\u2019t come at Hamilton\u2019s expense,\u201d he wrote last year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Terry Matthews, the first Welsh billionaire, is backing a proposed management buyout of Tata Steel UK, boosting hopes of a rescue deal for the Port Talbot steelworks and thousands of employees. Matthews is helping to put together a consortium of public and private sector figures from south Wales who can support the buyout. Other figures in the consortium include Simon Gibson, the chief executive of Matthews\u2019s investment vehicle Wesley Clover, and Steve Phillips, the chief executive of the Neath Port Talbot county borough council. Phillips said: \u201cWe are all like-minded people who believe that the UK steel industry has a future. The MBO [management buyout] deserves the opportunity to be heard. \u201cAt the moment, we are in the process of registering our interest. This is a serious option, but we are not saying we have all the answers and this is not without risk.\u2019 It is not yet clear whether Matthews is willing to fund a rescue of Port Talbot and Tata\u2019s UK business or is just helping to drum up support. Matthews is chairman of the Swansea Bay City Region, a partnership between businesses and local authorities. The entrepreneur, now based in Canada, is understood to be flying into the UK to holds talks. Phillips said work on the funding of the proposals was at an \u201cexploratory stage\u201d. The consortium held talks at the Celtic Manor resort in south Wales, which is owned by Matthews, earlier this week. Matthews is the third-richest man in Wales and made his fortune in technology and telecoms. He has founded or funded more than 100 companies, including comms business Mitel. Matthews is also credited with bringing the Ryder Cup to Wales after the golf tournament was held at Celtic Manor in 2010. The plan for a management buyout has been drawn up by Stuart Wilkie, the managing director of Tata\u2019s strip products business, which includes Port Talbot. The news that Matthews is backing Wilkie\u2019s proposals gives the management buyout plan greater credibility. It could be the best hope of securing the future of the Port Talbot steelworks. Sources close to Tata have warned there is a lack of interest in buying its entire UK business, which is losing \u00a31m a day. They have also played down the potential of Wilkie\u2019s turnaround plan, which was presented to the company\u2019s board last month in last-ditch attempt to stop it pulling out of the UK. One source said: \u201cIf it was credible then they [Tata] would have done it before.\u201d Wilkie is reported to have asked staff interested in his plans to contribute up to \u00a310,000 towards funding a deal. This offer could be extended to the 130,000 members of the British Steel Pension Scheme. The consortium also is thought to be pushing the government for support. It is keen for any management or employee buyout to enjoy tax breaks that it claims would be available for venture capitalists. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said the government was willing to co-invest with a potential buyer, meaning it could support a management buyout. Javid was in Mumbai on Tuesday holding private talks with Tata. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \u201cWe are doing everything we can to help the steel industry secure a long-term viable future and welcome any interest from potential bidders.\u201d Other potential bidders for Tata Steel UK include Liberty House, Sanjeev Gupta\u2019s metal company; Greybull, the investment firm that is buying Tata\u2019s steelworks in Scunthorpe; and ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial conglomerate. Trade unions welcomed news of the consortium\u2019s interest but said they had yet to be contacted. A spokesperson for Community, the steelworkers\u2019 union, said: \u201cWe welcome interest from all credible potential new owners. We are aware of reports that a management buyout is under consideration and would expect discussions with anyone considering leading such an initiative. \u201cWe are still in the very early stages of the sales process; however, it is clear that significant interest in the business exists from a number of different potential buyers. This is a sign that a long-term, profitable future for the industry is entirely possible.\u201d About 40,000 jobs are at risk after Tata announced last month that it would pull out of the UK steel industry. The figure includes 15,000 jobs at Tata and 25,000 in the supply chain. The management buyout would activate a turnaround plan for Port Talbot known as \u201cthe bridge\u201d. It involves \u00a3100m being injected into the business immediately. It would keep open the blast furnaces at Port Talbot, a key consideration for the government, and take 18 months to two years to get the business back into profit. Tata Steel has approached almost 200 parties about potentially bidding for the business. It has declined to reveal the identity of interested parties, as has the government. In a statement on Wednesday, Tata said: \u201cTata Steel Europe welcomes credible expressions of interest for Tata Steel\u2019s UK operations. It is our policy that we are not naming, confirming or commenting on any potentially interested investor or bidder at this point. \u201cAll expressions of interest, including any management buyout proposals, will be considered when received. In the interests of all stakeholders every credible expressions of interest will enter the same rigorous assessment process to ensure the best value and prospects of sustainability.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An opening rise on Wall Street and a revival in the oil price took some of the worry out of European markets, which shook off their early uncertainty. But the gains were hardly substantial and with oil producers unable to agree a cap on output, Greece back on the agenda, and the latest European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, investors remained cautious. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 4.91 points or 0.08% higher at 6410.26 after spending most of the day in negative territory Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.69% to 10,421.29 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.56% at 4591.92 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.14% to 18,658.36 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.96% at 9147.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.63% to 582.51 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 50 points or 0.3% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 1.5% at $44.7 a barrel. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over to Greece and there are some signs of optimism ahead of this week\u2019s eurogroup meeting and amid talk of a second get-together next week: Although: And here\u2019s that recent jump in the oil price: Oil is now in positive territory after its earlier falls, in the wake of the smaller than expected rise in US crude stocks. There is also unsubstantiated talk of another meeting of producers within weeks to discuss an output freeze again, despite the failure of the weekend\u2019s meeting to reach any agreement. Brent is now up 0.18% at $44.11 a barrel. David Morrison, market strategist at Spreadco, said: Oil bounced off its lows following the latest inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). This showed a smaller-than-expected build in stockpiles, and a reduction from the previous week. Crude was lower in early trade today on the news that a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers had come to an end. The strike began on Sunday, coinciding with the breakdown of talks between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to freeze output. There was additional downside pressure on prices due to data from the American Petroleum Institute which showed that US inventories rose by 3.1 million barrels on expectations of a 2.4 million barrel increase. There\u2019s a real tug-of-war going on now between bulls and bears with the line in the sand being $40 for front-month WTI. So far the bulls are winning as a pile of negative news has failed to derail a rally which took hold in mid-February. This has been driven by hopes of an output freeze, dollar weakness and a suggestion that the supplies may come back into line with demand sooner than previously anticipated. But efforts to push WTI much beyond $42.50 have failed so far and it could be that the upside momentum is fading. If so, then a retest of $36 looks possible, particularly if more signs appear of a slowdown in global growth. US crude oil stocks rose by 2.1m barrels last week to 538.61m, lower than the 2.4m increase expected by analysts. But gasoline stocks fell by 110,000 barrels compared to a forecast 1.2m decline. Gasoline demand over the past four weeks was up 3.9% from a year ago. Stockpiles of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.6m barrels compared to expectations of a 304,000 increase. After weak US housing starts data on Tuesday came signs that the market may not be that bad after all. Existing home sales jumped 5.1% in March to a better than expected 5.33m units. Analysts had expected an increase of 3.5%, and is a vast improvement on the 7.3% drop seen in February (itself revised down from the original 7.1% decline). The rise from March last year was 1.5%. Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors which released the figures, said: Closings came back in force last month as a greater number of buyers \u2013 mostly in the Northeast and Midwest \u2013 overcame depressed inventory levels and steady price growth to close on a home. Buyer demand remains sturdy in most areas this spring and the mid-priced market is doing quite well. However, sales are softer both at the very low and very high ends of the market because of supply limitations and affordability pressures. It\u2019s proving to be a bit of a mixed day on the markets. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 14 points in early trading, with Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 also marginally higher. German and French markets are also a few points better off but in the UK, the FTSE 100 has slipped 19 points or 0.3%. Meanwhile oil has come back from its worst levels, but Brent crude is still down 1.7i% at $43.28 a barrel as the Kuwait strike ended and attention turned back to the lack of agreement among oil producersat the weekend to cap output. Later come the latest US weekly crude inventories data. Back with the speech by MPC member Ian McCafferty, and a former member is not impressed: Thursday\u2019s meeting of the European Central Bank may not be as exciting as the March gathering, when interest rates were cut further and its bond buying programme was expanded. That is the view of Mads Koefoed of Saxo Bank, who says: [The] meeting of the governing council looks to be a sleepy affair with not much new coming to the surface. We may get some additional details on the corporate sector purchase programme (part of the \u20ac80bn monthly purchases), but otherwise the stage is set for Draghi to reiterate that the ECB stands ready to combat low inflation while expressing confidence in the measures announced last month. The ECB meeting always has the potential to be a market-mover, but this particular one looks destined to be a non-event. Will Draghi surprise? Again? On Brexit he said: Very recently there have been some signs that increased uncertainty linked to the outcome of the EU referendum to be held on 23 June may weigh on investment in coming months, such that we may see a slight softening in GDP growth through the summer, but our central projection for demand growth remains one of \u2018steady as she goes\u2019. Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty has said he will vote to raise rates again at some point, and there was no guarantee future rises would be gradual and limited. But he did not know when rates might rise due to the current uncertain economic outlook. In a speech at the Bank, he said: On the basis of our current central outlook for the UK economy, I still anticipate having to return to a vote to tighten monetary policy at some stage, although I cannot offer a firm date as to when that might occur \u2013 the uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the economy over the coming months is particularly acute at the moment. As a result, the long-standing guidance from the Monetary Policy Committee that we expect to raise interest rates in a gradual and limited fashion is not a promise \u2013 the actual path of monetary policy will, of course, depend on the performance of the economy. McCafferty voted to raise rates last August, and finally came round to the consensus view that they should be left unchanged in February. He warned that wage growth was being pushed down by low headline inflation, but could quickly begin rising once prices started going up again. Greece should not need extra measures to complete the bailout review with its lenders, according to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, although he admitted that the EU and IMF may have differing assessments about the state of the country\u2019s economy. Greece\u2019s Kathimerini reports: \u201cWe, as the Commission, are of the opinion that our figures are right and there is no need for contingency measures,\u201d Juncker said in an interview with euro2day.gr financial website made public Wednesday. \u201cMy impression is that the IMF does not believe in our figures,\u201d he added. The Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) is expected to announce on Thursday that the 2015 primary surplus was between 1.1 and 1.2 billion euros, or 0.6 to 0.7 percent of GDP. According to sources, the European Commission\u2019s statistical arm, Eurostat, has already rubber-stamped the data. IMF calculations, on the other hand, are based on the Fund\u2019s forecast that Greece produced a 0.5 percent of GDP deficit last year. \u201cWe have to wait for the figures to be published by Eurostat on Thursday,\u201d Juncker said. Asked about the implications of the differences between the EU and the IMF, Juncker said the two would have to \u201cbridge the gap.\u201d \u201cIf others are of the opinion that contingency measures are a way out of a situation and if these measures are proposed then we are ready to assess them,\u201d he said, adding that this would have to occur \u201cin close cooperation with the Greek government.\u201d In the same interview, the head of the Commission also criticized fresh speculation of a Greek exit from the eurozone. \u201cI don\u2019t think for one second that it would be wise and intelligent to restart this debate. Grexit did not happen and will not happen,\u201d Juncker said. Ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting on Thursday, something to cheer up president Mario Draghi. The ECB, Draghi in particular, has been criticised by a number of German bigwigs, notably finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble although he was later defended by the Bundesbank. Now another politician has come to his defence, reports Reuters: German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel leapt to the defense of the European Central Bank on Wednesday, saying it was time to stop bashing the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, and instead up to governments to agree on measures to boost growth. Members of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives have complained loudly in recent weeks that the low-interest rate policies of the ECB are creating a \u201cgaping hole\u201d in savers\u2019 finances as returns have dropped. Some conservatives have called for the next ECB president to come from Germany. \u201cThis game of ECB bad guy - this must come to an end,\u201d Gabriel told a news conference in Berlin, the main highlight of which became his defense of the ECB rather than the advertised focus on growth forecasts. Gabriel is leader of Germany\u2019s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior coalition partner of Merkel\u2019s conservatives. \u201cIf you engage in the debate, you quickly realise that the problem is not the ECB and Mr Draghi but rather the lack of willingness to give up a focus purely on austerity,\u201d he said. A quick recap. The European Union has opened a new front against Google, accusing the software giant of harming competition in the mobile sector. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said Google is harming innovation by forcing mobile operators to include its applications in return for access to its Play Store, and offering financial inducements. Google has denied the charge, insisting that Android is free and open source. Economists fear that Britain\u2019s jobs recovery is bottoming out, after the unemployment total jumped by 21,000. The claimant count also rose, while the jobless rate remains at 5.1%. Uncertainty over the EU Referendum outcome in June may be partly to blame, as firms cut back on investment. Financial markets have dipped, following recent solid gains. China led the way, with shares sliding on fears of a clampdown on credit. The oil price has fallen, after refinery workers in Kuwait ended a strike. Brent crude is down 1.5% at $43.38 per barrel, on fears that the oil glut will worsen. Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi has admitted manipulating test data to overstate the fuel efficiency of 625,000 cars. The EC\u2019s move has been welcomed by Fairsearch, a group of search services which brought the initial complaint against Google. Reuters has the details: FairSearch, the lead complainant, said Google had launched Android as an open source project, but was now hindering the development of versions that might lead to new operating systems able to compete with Android. This is the issue of \u2018forking\u2019, where a piece of software splits off into different versions. It\u2019s one of the reasons that open source software has been so successful over the last couple of decades, with developers creating new code which is then released back to the community. Today\u2019s complaint, though, claims that Google forces phone makers to enter into an \u201cAnti-Fragmentation Agreement\u201d that commits it not to sell devices running on Android forks. That prevents rival versions of Android springing up, critics argue. Google has swiftly responded to the European Commission\u2019s charges, insisting that Android is a \u201cfree and open-source operating system.\u201d It also denies forcing mobile phone makers to give its applications unfair treatment, as the EC claims today. Kent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, says: \u201cOur partner agreements are entirely voluntary,\u201d \u201cWe look forward to working with the European Commission to demonstrate the careful way we\u2019ve designed the Android model in a way that\u2019s good for competition and for consumers.\u201d Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 news story about the EC\u2019s latest clash with Google, which broke an hour ago. EU charges Google with abusing market dominance of Android Google found itself under fire again on Wednesday from EU antitrust regulators who say it abused the dominant position of its Android mobile operating system, a move which could hit a key money-spinner for the company. The charges by the European Commission open up a second battle with the world\u2019s most popular Internet search engine, putting it at risk of hefty fines and radical changes to its business practices. Google is already facing EU charges of promoting its own shopping service in Internet searches at the expense of rival products, a case which has dragged on since late 2010 and marked by three failed attempts to resolve the issues. The stakes are higher in the Android case for Google which made about $11 billion from ad sales on Android phones with Google apps such as Maps, Search and Gmail last year. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. \u201cA competitive mobile Internet sector is increasingly important for consumers and businesses in Europe. \u201cBased on our investigation thus far, we believe that Google\u2019s behavior denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stands in the way of innovation by other players.\u201d It said about 80 percent of smart mobile devices in Europe and in the world run on Android, the mobile operating system developed by Google. Google has breached EU antitrust rules, the Commision alleges, by requiring manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google\u2019s Chrome browser and preventing manufacturers from selling mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android open source code. It is also charged with giving financial incentives to manufacturers and network operators to pre-install exclusively Google search on devices. The Commission\u2019s case against Google is online, here: Antitrust: Commission sends Statement of Objections to Google on Android operating system and applications You cannot use Google\u2019s Play Store to buy another app store, Vestager points out. So it becomes quite tricky to find another shop to do your shopping. Google\u2019s success partly comes from making applications that are popular with many consumers, she continues, but it isn\u2019t allowed to abuse that position. Commissioner Vestager repeats that Google has hurt competition by forcing mobile phone makers to install its search applications and Chrome browser, in return for access to its Play Store. If you want innovation to happen, here should be an incentive to innovate, she says. One of the best motivations is to be able to present your innovations, your services to potential customers. That is what is at stake. Maybe it has become too difficult, or impossibe, for other search machines and other app stores to present themselves to the consumer Q: Why is the Commission not concerned about Apple\u2019s iPhone? Apple doesn\u2019t licence its operating system to other phone makers, Margrethe Vestager replies. Q: What remedy must Google provide? Could it just be a change of contract, or will Google need to make technical changes? The remedy is simple - to stop prices that are damaging innovation and competition, Vestager says. Yesterday, Canada closed an ant-trust investigation against Google, so why does Europe have a different view. asks Politico\u2019s Nicholas Hirst. Q: Is it targeting Google as part of its push to create a digital single market? Margrethe Vestager insists that the EU doesn\u2019t have a grudge against any particular company. We are responding to complaints. Q: How much damage has Google caused to the European economy? It\u2019s hard to say, Vestager replies, but the impact goes beyond simply the search area. It may be wide-ranging - stifling competition and hurting innovation in the wider tech space. We all want an innovative economy, she adds, but what\u2019s the point if companies don\u2019t have a level playing field? Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is briefing reporters in Brussels now. She says Google has played \u201cunjustified restrictions\u201d on mobile manufacturers, meaning some have chosen not to use applications from rival software makers. The European Commission claims that Google is breaking EU law by forcing mobile phone makers who use Android to give preferential treatment to Google applications. In today\u2019s Statement of Objections, the Commission alleges that Google is: requiring manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google\u2019s Chrome browser and requiring them to set Google Search as default search service on their devices, as a condition to license certain Google proprietary apps; preventing manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android open source code; giving financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices. Newsflash: The European Commission has formally charged Google with breaking competition rules over its Android mobile operating system. Competition chief Margrethe Vestager has tweeted the news (from an iPhone) Here\u2019s our economics correspondent, Phillip Inman, on today\u2019s jobs report: The number of people out of work in Britain increased for the first time in seven months in February. In a signal that the referendum vote in June is having an impact on the economy, the latest labour market report showed that the unemployment total rose by 21,000 in the three months to February to 1.7 million. This was the first increase since last August but left the headline unemployment rate unchanged at 5.1%. The claimant count, which measures people receiving out of work benefits, jumped by 6,700 in March. This is also the first increase since August 2015. In a further blow to the government\u2019s efforts to keep the economy growing strongly, wage growth including bonuses fell from 2.1% in January to 1.8% . The measure of wages excluding bonuses remained at 2.2%..... More here: John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the rise in unemployment shows that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU referendum are hurting the economy: \u201cThe UK economy has been a great job creating machine for most of the past three years, but the latest data suggest that this has levelled off over the past three months.... These latest data are consistent with other evidence that UK growth slowed somewhat during the first quarter of 2016, reflecting a more fragile global economy and uncertainty related to the EU Referendum outcome in June. Time will tell whether this proves to be a temporary blip or a more pronounced slowdown, although our main scenario is still that the UK will achieve GDP growth of around 2% this year with the unemployment rate remaining around 5%.\u201d Professor Geraint Johnes of Lancaster University Management School and The Work Foundation also believes Britain\u2019s labour market is slowing. He says: \u201cUnemployment is 21000 up on the quarter, but employment is also 20000 up, with a fall in labour market inactivity. Amongst employees in employment, there has been a fall in full-time numbers of 34000 and a rise in part-time of 11000 - suggesting something of a slowdown. The big news, though, is the fall in wage growth - which worsened in February. For total pay on the single month measure, this is down from 2.6% to 1.1%. The big slowdown here is in finance. Pay in construction is still steaming ahead, at 8.6% over the course of the year. This chart shows how average earnings growth has come off the boil recently: Today\u2019s report also shows the stark regional imbalances across Britain\u2019s jobs market: Mariano Mamertino, economist at job site Indeed, fears that the UK\u2019s referendum on European Union membership has pushed the unemployment total up: Mamertino says: \u201cModest though it is, the increase in unemployment is a deeply worrying sign that the UK economy\u2019s ability to create new jobs is running out of steam. \u201cUnemployment remains at a historically low level, but the lengthening dole queue is a warning of trouble ahead. \u201cThe combination of strengthening economic headwinds, and the political uncertainty triggered by the Brexit referendum, is having a dramatic cooling effect on employers\u2019 appetite to hire. \u201cAt the end of March, just a month on from the confirmation of the Brexit referendum, the number of live job postings by UK employers on our site had fallen across all 13 major sectors. \u201cThis is in sharp contrast to February, when job postings increased across the board. Stephen Crabb, the new Work and Pensions Secretary, has commented on today\u2019s jobs report (but not mentioned the jump in unemployment). \u201cWe remain in a position of strength, with a record employment rate, wages continuing to grow steadily and three-quarters of a million vacancies available in the labour market. \u201cWork is essential in transforming the lives of the most disadvantaged people in society and is at the heart of our welfare reforms. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that everyone across the country benefits from our strong economy and the opportunities this brings.\u201d The rise in unemployment in the last quarter may show that Britain\u2019s jobs recovery is bottoming out. Nick Palmer, statistician at the Office for National Statistics, says: \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to be certain but, with unemployment up for the first time since mid-2015, and employment seeing its slowest rise since that period, it\u2019s possible that recent improvements in the labour market may be easing off.\u201d The employment rate has strengthened pretty steadily for the last four years, but has been hovering around 74% since the last quarter of 2015: The UK labour market appears to be \u2018softening\u2019, warns Duncan Weldon, the head of research at Resolution Group. Marc Ostwald, analyst at ADM Investor Services, says today\u2019s data is \u201cvery poor\u201d The number of people in work across Britain has also gone up. The employment total rose by 20,000 in the last quarter, to 31.41m, and is 360,000 higher than a year ago. The number of people out of work in Britain has risen for the first time in seven months. The latest labour market report, just released, shows that the unemployment total rose by 21,000 in the December-February quarter to 1.70 million. It\u2019s the first rise since last May-July. That leaves the headline unemployment rate unchanged at 5.1%. The claimant count, which measures people receiving unemployment benefit, has jumped by 6,700 in March. This is also the first increase since August 2015. In another blow.... average wages including bonuses rose by just 1.8% during the quarter, down from 2.1% a month earlier. That may be due to a dropoff in City bonuses. Excluding bonuses, wage growth were unchanged at 2.2%. Reaction to follow..... Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi has just admitted that some employees have falsified data on emission tests to improve its vehicles\u2019 fuel economy. In an obvious echo of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, Mitsubishi says that the the false tests involves 625,000 cars, including some supplied to Nissan. Nissan discovered the issue and the two companies are discussing compensation, according to Bloomberg. The pound has dipped a little this morning, down 0.15% against the US dollar at $1.4370. This chart from Bloomberg\u2019s David Ingles, showing how sterling has already weakened against most major currencies this year, as the EU referendum casts a shadow of uncertainty. There\u2019s no escape from Brexit fears. Overnight, eight former US Treasury secretaries have warned that Britain would become a \u2018less relevant and less significant economy\u2019 if it leaves the European Union. European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is expected to announce new antitrust charges against Google at 10.30am BST (11.30am in Belgium). Brussels correspondents will be busy! Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, explains why ARM\u2019s shares are bucking the downturn: Arm is now shipping more than half of its chips to non-mobile markets, meaning the company\u2019s fortunes cannot simply be linked directly to the likes of Apple anymore. That\u2019s just as well for Arm, as it looks like shipments of Apple\u2019s iPhones nosedived in the first quarter. Slowing smartphone sales, particularly in China, don\u2019t seem to be as much as a problem as many would have thought. Arm seems well placed to ride out any relative decline in growth for Apple and other smartphone makers as it\u2019s good at innovating \u2013 vital within a fast-changing market.\u201d The car industry\u2019s test-rigging scandal may be deepening. Mitsubishi, the Japanese automaker, has found evidence of problems with its fuel economy test results. A spokesman says: \u201cOne of our models was found to have failed part of a fuel economy test.\u201d Further details are expected shortly.... Shares in Mitsubishi have tanked by 17%: Europe\u2019s main stock markets are all down this morning: Shares in ARM, the UK semiconductor maker, have jumped 2.6% after beating City expectations. ARM reported a 14% jump in profits this morning, as it continued to outperform despite concerns that demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone is falling. The London stock market has opened lower, with the FTSE 100 losing 26 points to 6377. Mining firms leading the fallers, with Anglo American shedding 2% and Glencore down 1.5%. They would suffer if China\u2019s central bank did crack down on credit, as Ma Jun hinted overnight. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets calls it a \u201cmild retreat\u201d from yesterday\u2019s first foray above 6400 points: Note renewed concern about China, with stocks sharply lower on suggestions the People\u2019s Bank of China has less stimulus appetite thanks to an improving outlook all the while worries grow about the country\u2019s mounting bad debts. The mood in China\u2019s stock markets has turned rather sour today. The main Shanghai share index has fallen by 3% in a worrying late selloff, with every sector losing ground. The selloff may have been triggered by one of China\u2019s top central bank economists, Ma Jun. He told the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s official newspaper that monetary policymakers will rein in excessive borrowing by companies and individuals. Or as he put it: \u201cAside from continuing to support steady economic growth, future monetary policy will focus on guarding against macroeconomic risks, especially avoiding rapid growth in companies\u2019 leverage, and will also consider the impact of increased loans on the cost of living and real estate prices.\u201d Reuters has more details: China may be more cautious with future policy easing - Financial News Chinese credit has exploded in recent years, helping avoid the economy slowing sharply. Any tightening could have a significant impact on growth The oil price is in retreat this morning after Kuwaiti workers ended a three day strike. Brent crude has slumped by 2.5% already, down over $1 to $42.95 per barrel, as traders anticipate more oil flowing from Kuwait again. Workers had walked out on Sunday, protesting against austerity cutbacks that will hit their wages and benefits. It\u2019s not clear what concessions they have been handed, though, in return for ending their display of labour power. Associated Press has the details: The state-run Kuwait News Agency reported that the unions ended the strike by praising the country\u2019s ruling emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, and saying their action showed their \u201cability to affect the production process.\u201d The unions \u201centrusted his highness, the emir, (with) the protection of rights of the employees in the oil sector,\u201d the unions said, according to KUNA. It said workers wouldn\u2019t be disciplined for taking part in the strike. Adel al-Fadhel, a spokesman for the Kuwait Oil Company Workers\u2019 Union, confirmed workers would go back to work Wednesday. He said Sheikh Sabah spoke to the head of one of the unions Tuesday by telephone to assure his support for the workers. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to announce that the strike has succeeded in preserving the rights of the workers in the oil sector,\u201d al-Fadhel told The Associated Press. \u201cHis highness, the emir, intervened and guaranteed to preserve the rights of the workers according to the law.\u201d Around half of Kuwait\u2019s usual oil production had been taken offline by the strike, which helped drive oil prices higher on Monday and Tuesday. Now, though, traders can return to worrying about supply gluts, and Opec\u2019s seeming inability to do anything about it..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. Coming up today..... At 9.30am, the latest UK unemployment figures are released. Economists expect the UK jobless claimant count to fall by another 10,000 people, while the unemployment rate remains at 5.1%. But today\u2019s report may also show that wage growth remains lacklustre. Average earnings growth (ex-bonuses) is tipped to slow to 2.1%, from 2.2% a month ago. There may be drama in Brussels this morning, if the European Commission hits Google with anti-competitive charges concerning its Android mobile phone operating system. Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner, is expected to make the announcement today: Closer to home, the bosses of the Port Talbot steel plant in South Wales may announce a buyout plan for the site.

The strike began on Sunday, coinciding with the breakdown of talks between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to freeze output. There was additional downside pressure on prices due to data from the American Petroleum Institute which showed that US inventories rose by 3.1 million barrels on expectations of a 2.4 million barrel increase.</p> <p>There\u2019s a real tug-of-war going on now between bulls and bears with the line in the sand being $40 for front-month WTI. So far the bulls are winning as a pile of negative news has failed to derail a rally which took hold in mid-February. This has been driven by hopes of an output freeze, dollar weakness and a suggestion that the supplies may come back into line with demand sooner than previously anticipated. But efforts to push WTI much beyond $42.50 have failed so far and it could be that the upside momentum is fading. If so, then a retest of $36 looks possible, particularly if more signs appear of a slowdown in global growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-571796d9e4b0b18037cf1ecc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-20T14:49:01.567Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/status/722798030353596417\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CrudeOil?src=hash\">#CrudeOil</a> pares earlier losses on slightly lower-than-expected US crude inventory build, despite end to Kuwaiti oil workers&#39; strike. ^JC</p>&mdash; FOREX.com (@FOREXcom) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/status/722798030353596417\">April 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-571792eee4b035ab5a57a8d3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-20T14:34:38.068Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US weekly crude stocks climb by less than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude oil stocks rose by 2.1m barrels last week to 538.61m, lower than the 2.4m increase expected by analysts.</p> <p>But gasoline stocks fell by 110,000 barrels compared to a forecast 1.2m decline.</p> <p>Gasoline demand over the past four weeks was up 3.9% from a year ago.</p> <p>Stockpiles of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.6m barrels compared to expectations of a 304,000 increase.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-20T14:44:15.593Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57178bcfe4b0570550fd119b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-20T14:14:36.260Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US home sale rebound</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After weak US housing starts data on Tuesday came signs that the market may not be that bad after all.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2016/04/existing-home-sales-spring-ahead-in-march\">Existing home sales</a></strong> jumped 5.1% in March to a better than expected 5.33m units.

      "bodyText": "A Bank of England policymaker has admitted he got it wrong when predicting a significant pickup in wages, prompting him to abandon his call for a rise in interest rates. Ian McCafferty, who sits on the Bank\u2019s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, started voting for rate hikes in August 2015. He was the only member of the nine-strong committee to do so. He continued to vote for a 0.25 percentage point hike at every monthly meeting until February 2016, when he joined his MPC colleagues in voting to hold rates at 0.5%, where they have been since March 2009. Giving a speech at Threadneedle Street, McCafferty said he had dropped his calls for a rise in borrowing costs because he said he had been surprised by the weak rate of pay growth. He added that he had expected wage growth to pick up against a backdrop of a growing economy and record employment. McCafferty was also surprised that weak headline inflation \u2013 with the consumer price index currently at 0.5% \u2013 appeared to be holding back pay. He said: \u201cLast summer, in voting for an increase in bank rate, I had expected that the narrowing of slack would drive up wages through 2016 as firms competed for increasingly scarce labour. But it now appears that opposing factors are acting to hold wage growth down, for rather longer than I had thought.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt has become increasingly clear to me that the current low level of headline inflation is also having a material impact on the pace of wage growth \u2013 and it is this factor that has been paramount in the evolution of my thinking about the balance of risks around domestic cost pressures, and the appropriate policy stance.\u201d The average UK worker suffered from six years of falling wages in real terms from 2008 as inflation outpaced pay growth. Pay growth has since picked up, but is still below pre-crisis levels and has remained sluggish despite other signs of improvement in the UK jobs market. The latest official data published on Wednesday showed wage growth excluding bonuses was unchanged in the three months to February at 2.2% compared with a year earlier. Pay including bonuses fell to 1.8% from 2.1% in January. McCafferty said: \u201cI continue to expect the ongoing process of normalisation to proceed and for the economy to continue to recover, as well as for consumer price inflation to revert to our 2% target. \u201cBut the time over which this is likely to occur has been delayed. This delay, combined with the current dynamic between current inflation and wage determination, has led me to suspend my call for an immediate increase in bank rate.\u201d Despite his decision to drop his call for rate rises, McCafferty said it was possible that his vote to keep rates on hold might prove \u201cshort-lived\u201d.",

But it now appears that opposing factors are acting to hold wage growth down, for rather longer than I had thought.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cIt has become increasingly clear to me that the current low level of headline inflation is also having a material impact on the pace of wage growth \u2013 and it is this factor that has been paramount in the evolution of my thinking about the balance of risks around domestic cost pressures, and the appropriate policy stance.\u201d <br></p> <p>The average UK worker suffered from six years of falling wages in real terms from 2008 as inflation outpaced pay growth. Pay growth has since picked up, but is still below pre-crisis levels and has remained sluggish despite other signs of improvement in the UK jobs market.<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/20/uk-unemployment-rises-and-pay-growth-falls\">The latest official data published on Wednesday showed wage growth excluding bonuses was unchanged in the three months to February</a> at 2.2% compared with a year earlier. Pay including bonuses fell to 1.8% from 2.1% in January.</p> <p>McCafferty said: \u201cI continue to expect the ongoing process of normalisation to proceed and for the economy to continue to recover, as well as for consumer price inflation to revert to our 2% target. <br></p> <p>\u201cBut the time over which this is likely to occur has been delayed. This delay, combined with the current dynamic between current inflation and wage determination, has led me to suspend my call for an immediate increase in bank rate.\u201d </p> <p>Despite his decision to drop his call for rate rises, McCafferty said it was possible that his vote to keep rates on hold might prove \u201cshort-lived\u201d.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Ikea has repeated safety warnings to customers about its Malm budget furniture range after a third child was crushed to death when a chest of drawers fell on him. The Swedish company was forced to issue advice about the range \u2013 available online and in stores across the world including the UK and US \u2013 in July last year after two children were killed in separate incidents in 2014. In the latest tragedy, 22-month-old Ted McGee managed to tip a wooden chest of drawers on to himself at his home in Minnesota in February. His mother said she put him down for a nap and was checking on him every 20 minutes until she found his bed empty and assumed he was hiding \u2013 only to find him under the chest. Ikea said the self-assembly chest was not fixed to the wall and issued another safety warning to parents. In the US, federal safety regulators have launched an investigation into the incident, which took place seven months after the retailer disclosed that millions of the chests were at risk of falling forward if not properly stabilised. In February 2014, a two-year-old boy from Pennsylvania died when a Malm chest fell on him and pinned him to a bed. Three months later, a 23-month-old child from Washington was killed when a three-drawer Malm chest tipped over. Although no deaths have been reported in the UK, parents here have been urged to use the wall restraints that come with the flat-pack furniture. Consumers in the UK worried about the furniture are urged to contact Ikea on 0203 645 0010 to request a free restraint kit if they no longer have the original. An Ikea spokesperson said: \u201cWe at Ikea offer our deepest condolences to the McGee family. At Ikea, we believe children are the most important people in the world and the safety of our products is our highest priority. Upon being informed of this incident Ikea US immediately reported it to the authorities and an investigation is taking place. Ikea US has been advised that the product was not attached to the wall, which is an integral part of the products\u2019 assembly instructions.\u201d It added: \u201cWe wish to emphasise that the best way to prevent tip-over of chests of drawers is to attach products to the wall with the included restraints and hardware per the assembly instructions. Ikea has included restraints with our chest of drawers for decades, and wall attachment is an integral part of the assembly instructions.\u201d The McGee family\u2019s lawyer has claimed they were not aware of the issue or the previous safety warning.",

As the boss at Port Talbot seeks backing for a management buyout to save the business, this is how the politically explosive crisis built over five years. May 2011 Tata Steel, Britain\u2019s biggest steelmaker, announces 1,500 job cuts at its sites in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, and on Teesside. The company, which owns the rump of the former British Steel, blames a post-financial-crisis construction slump and the cost of new climate change rules from the EU and in the UK.

Unions call on the government to spend on infrastructure projects and to support British industry in public procurement contracts. July 2013 Tata suffers a record \u00a31.2bn loss for the year to March 2013, triggering speculation that it is looking to sell some or all of the UK business it bought in 2007.

July 2014 Tata Steel cuts another 400 jobs at Port Talbot, warning that demand and prices will be under pressure for several years and criticising high UK business rates. September 2015 Thai-owned SSI mothballs operations at its plant at Redcar, Teesside, ending production after almost 100 years. Redcar enters liquidation the following month with the loss of 2,200 jobs. 16 October 2015 Tata Steel says it will mothball steel mills in Scunthorpe and Scotland and that 1,200 jobs will be lost as a result. The company highlights a flood of cheap Chinese steel into Europe as one of the main causes for the industry\u2019s plight. The government, previously reluctant to intervene, launches a flurry of activity, including a visit by Sajid Javid, the business secretary, to Brussels to press the case for action, particularly on cheap Chinese imports, and new procurement guidelines for government departments to buy UK steel where possible. 19 October 2015 The crisis in the industry mounts as Caparo, the steel business built by the Labour peer Lord Paul, enters administration, putting 1,700 jobs at risk. More than one in six of the steel industry\u2019s already depleted workforce are now in danger of losing their job. 20 October 2015 With the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Britain for a state visit, Labour MPs attack Javid and accuse the government of failing to press Xi on dumping by Chinese companies of cheap steel in Europe. Javid says there is little the government can do about the plunging steel price. 10 December 2015 Liberty House, run by the metals trader Sanjeev Gupta, buys Caparo\u2019s advanced engineering business, saving 600 jobs. Liberty had snapped up Caparo\u2019s tubes arm and and reopened a hot rolling mill in Newport, south Wales, in October. 22 December 2015 In a highly critical report, parliament\u2019s business, innovation and skills committee says the government reacted too slowly to the steel crisis, leaving the industry permanently damaged. 24 March 2016 Liberty House buys Tata Steel\u2019s two Lanarkshire steel mills, which were due to be mothballed, in a deal brokered by the Scottish government. 29 March 2016 Union leaders and Stephen Kinnock, MP for Aberavon, fly to Mumbai to meet Tata Steel\u2019s bosses as the Indian company considers the future of its UK steel business. Javid flies to Australia for a cybersecurity roundtable. 30 March 2016 Tata Steel announces plans to sell its entire UK business, which employs 15,000 people \u2013 4,000 of them at Port Talbot, Britain\u2019s biggest steelworks. Including jobs in the wider supply chain, about 40,000 workers are estimated to depend on the business for work. The business minister Anna Soubry says the government is looking at all options to save the business as unions accuse it of inaction. Javid flies back from Australia and David Cameron returns from a holiday in Lanzarote as Tata, expressing frustration with the government, warns that a buyer must be found within weeks. Kinnock accuses the government of being \u201cin hock to China\u201d. 31 March 2016 After Soubry leaves the door open for some form of nationalisation of Tata Steel, Cameron says public ownership is not the answer. 1 April 2016 The European Steel Association accuses the UK government of acting as a ringleader in blocking attempts to regulate cheap Chinese steel entering Europe. Javid visits Port Talbot for the first time and is confronted by hundreds of steel workers. The business secretary, under pressure for taking his daughter on his Australian trip, urges Tata to act responsibly and allow time for a buyer to be found. 5 April 2016 Gupta emerges as a potential buyer for Tata Steel but says Port Talbot\u2019s blast furnaces will need to be replaced by arc furnaces for recycling steel instead of making it from scratch. Gupta says Tata Steel\u2019s pension fund could be an obstacle to a deal and calls on the government to support a sale. 6 April 2016 After meeting Tata bosses in Mumbai, Javid says the company will allow time for a buyer to be found and has \u201cno set timeframe\u201d that could lead to a sudden closure. 11 April 2016 Tata Steel officially starts the process of looking for a buyer. Javid says the government will consider \u201cco-investing on commercial terms\u201d with a buyer in an apparent softening of his line against some form of nationalisation. Tata Steel agrees the sale of its UK long products business to the investment group Greybull Capital for \u00a31. The deal, discussed since late December, will revive the British Steel name and secure 4,400 jobs. 20 April 2016 Stuart Wilkie, the boss of the Port Talbot plant, seeks investors for a management buyout of the business.",

      "bodyText": "Rents in London\u2019s skyscrapers are soaring, rising much faster than those in other major cities around the world, due to booming demand for landmark buildings and a lack of new office space. The upmarket estate agent Knight Frank said the cost of renting in office towers such as the Shard, Walkie Talkie and Cheesegrater rose 9.7% to $126 (\u00a387.50) per square foot in the second half of 2015 from the previous six months and by 21.4% from a year earlier. The 21-city skyscraper index compared the rental performance of commercial buildings of more than 30 storeys across the world against the first half of 2015. The UK capital also topped the table between January and June 2015, with an 11% rise in rents. London rents rose twice as fast as those in San Francisco, at 4.76%, and three times quicker than in Hong Kong and Mumbai, where rents went up by 3%. Will Beardmore-Gray, Knight Frank\u2019s head of tenant representation and agency business, said rents in London were likely to head higher still due to \u201chuge demand for space in landmark, tall buildings\u201d. He said London had not provided the tower space international companies were looking for until recently. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more tower buildings in central London that you could put in any capital and be proud of.\u201d James Roberts, the chief economist at Knight Frank, said: \u201cLondon has held up relatively well through what was a slow patch for the global economy over the last year.\u201d He added that supply in the City office market was at its lowest since mid-2001. London was likely to be top of the rental growth table again this year, he said, barring a vote to leave the EU in the June referendum, which could lead to the market stalling. Roberts explained that firms that have been reluctant to relocate because of economic uncertainty would have to move to more modern premises at some point and that the \u201ciconic architecture\u201d of the new skyscrapers was a draw. \u201cThe buildings haven\u2019t been boring boxes,\u201d he said. Tenants in the Walkie Talkie and Cheesegrater, both relatively recent additions to the London skyline, paid the highest rents in the capital last year. They are in the EC3 post code, dominated by the insurance industry, which has fared much better than the banking sector in recent years. The towers are set to be overshadowed by 22 Bishopsgate \u2013 the reworked Pinnacle \u2013 which will be the largest office building built in London, after the City of London corporation backed its developers in a battle over the \u201cright to light\u201d with neighbouring buildings. The next skyscraper in the City, expected to be finished in late 2018, will be Brookfield\u2019s 100 Bishopsgate. There are 436 buildings above 20 storeys in the pipeline across London. The high-rise boom has provoked controversy over its impact on the skyline, while residents and businesses are concerned about wind tunnels and a lack of light. Until about 10 years ago, there were few skyscrapers in London. Between the NatWest tower in 1979 and the Gherkin in 2003, not a single one was built in the City. Bruce Dear, the head of London real estate at Eversheds, said: \u201cThere is a floating city above London in the Canary Wharf and City tower clusters. Space in these towers is scarce and high status, like high-rise white truffles. So the towers rental market obeys different laws to the rents of ground dwellers. Ultimately, scarcity is allowing these towers to defy the slowing global economy.\u201d The skyscraper index shows that Hong Kong remains the most expensive place to rent in the world \u2013 the average rent is more than twice as high as in London, at $263.25 per sq ft per year. New York remains in second place at $155, followed by Tokyo at $128.75 and London at $126. Singapore was the only city where rents saw a significant decline in the second half of 2015. The 4.75% drop was caused by oversupply of office space and a drop in business confidence as a result of the slowdown in the Chinese economy. In Beijing, skyscraper rents dropped by 0.71% to $62.75 per sq ft. Frankfurt posted a decline of 1.16%, to $51.75 per sq ft. Paris was flat at $55.75, while skyscraper rents in Toronto, Dubai and Madrid were also unchanged. In the US, the booming technology sector has underpinned rental growth for towers in cities like San Francisco and Boston. Rent growth in Mumbai\u2019s skyscrapers has also been driven by the tech industry, which overtook financial and business services as the top occupier of office space in the second half of 2015.",

    "webTitle": "UK unemployment rise: Crabb claims Brexit threat could be to blame", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The threat of a potential vote to leave the EU in June could be partly to blame for the first rise in unemployment in seven months, the work and pensions secretary has warned. Stephen Crabb said the latest labour report, which showed the unemployment total rose by 21,000 in the three months to February to 1.7 million, was a signal that the looming EU referendum vote was hitting the jobs market. Crabb, who took over following the resignation of Iain Duncan Smith last month, said the uncertainty over the UK\u2019s participation in the single market could be linked to the increase in joblessness. He told the BBC: \u201cMark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has also said that the question mark hanging over Britain\u2019s relationship with the European single market is having a real-terms impact on the British economy and impacting on sterling exchange rates, impacting on investment decisions.\u201d \u201cThere will be companies right now today who have been looking at major investments into the UK who are hanging back and considering whether that\u2019s the right thing to do. So of course that will have an impact. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying that the increase of 21,000 in unemployment is as a direct result of that, but it\u2019s an example of the kind of really gritty questions that those people who say Britain should leave the single market need to respond to and explain why their vision of coming out of the single market actually makes the picture better and enhances job opportunities for British workers.\u201d His comments sparked a row on the Conservative benches as Tory MPs accused Crabb of \u201ccynically\u201d linking Brexit to a rise in unemployment. Penny Mordaunt, the Armed Forces minister, said: \u201cThese unemployment figures are about people\u2019s lives. They are not just statistics to be cynically dragged into the referendum debate. She added: \u201cRemain campaigners should not do down the British economy, our entrepreneurs or our businesses. Our government has a strong record of creating jobs.\u201d The rise in the jobless rate was the first since last August but left the headline unemployment rate unchanged at 5.1%. The claimant count, which measures people receiving out of work benefits, jumped by 6,700 in March, also the first such increase since August. In a further blow to the government\u2019s efforts to keep the economy growing strongly, wage growth including bonuses fell from 2.1% in January to 1.8%. The measure of wages excluding bonuses remained at 2.2%. Analysts blamed a drop in City bonuses at the end of the financial year for much of the fall, but the economy has relied heavily on consumer spending to keep high street tills ringing and business services growing, so any fall is likely to hit GDP growth in the first quarter. Crabb received support from the UK economist Kallum Pickering, of Berenberg Bank, who said Brexit uncertainty may begin to feature more prominently in the coming months \u201cand temporarily reduce demand for new labour, as well as weigh on prospects for wage growth\u201d. \u201cThere is a modest risk that unemployment could increase slightly and wage gains stagnate. But that wouldn\u2019t be too much of a concern so long as the UK votes to stay in the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cLabour demand should begin to accelerate again after the vote. We expect unemployment to fall to 4.9% by the end of the year, further tightening in the labour market should begin to contribute to faster wage growth too.\u201d But most experts said the economic slowdown \u2013 dating back to last summer, and which has brought manufacturing and construction sector growth to a standstill \u2013 was more to blame for rising unemployment. Scott Bowman, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said the lack of inflationary wage rises would prevent the Bank of England from raising interest rates in the near future. \u201cWage growth remains fairly subdued considering how much the labour market has tightened recently. With a sustained rise in wage growth still needing to be seen before inflationary pressures start to build, a rate hike still looks to be some way in the distance,\u201d he said. Laura Gardiner, a senior analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said it was concerning that pay growth had stalled at a time when inflation was rising, squeezing real incomes. \u201cOne of the key routes to stronger pay growth is moving jobs, particularly for young people at the start of their careers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe current lack of job mobility \u2013 which may reflect a lack of confidence among both young people and employers \u2013 risks holding back their careers and earning potential.\u201d",

They are not just statistics to be cynically dragged into the referendum debate.</p> <p>She added: \u201cRemain campaigners should not do down the British economy, our entrepreneurs or our businesses. Our government has a strong record of creating jobs.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>The rise in the jobless rate was the first since last August but left the headline unemployment rate unchanged at 5.1%. The claimant count, which measures people receiving out of work benefits, jumped by 6,700 in March, also the first such increase since August.<br></p> <p>In a further blow to the government\u2019s efforts to keep the economy growing strongly, wage growth including bonuses fell from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/16/uk-unemployment-10-year-low-wage-growth-edges-up\">2.1% in January</a> to 1.8%. The measure of wages excluding bonuses remained at 2.2%.</p> <p>Analysts blamed a drop in City bonuses at the end of the financial year for much of the fall, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/feb/17/why-wages-arent-growing-in-line-with-jobs\">the economy has relied heavily on consumer spending</a> to keep high street tills ringing and business services growing, so any fall is likely to hit GDP growth in the first quarter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3c2e958cce7d6e1cca5c60e5e973d496e9e5857\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3c2e958cce7d6e1cca5c60e5e973d496e9e5857/0_51_2813_1687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A job centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unemployment total rose by 21,000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crabb received support from the UK economist Kallum Pickering, of Berenberg Bank, who said Brexit uncertainty may begin to feature more prominently in the coming months \u201cand temporarily reduce demand for new labour, as well as weigh on prospects for wage growth\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a modest risk that unemployment could increase slightly and wage gains stagnate.

The 684 staff are employed by British Gas services in call centre and back room office work supporting the company\u2019s engineers who attend call-outs and mend boilers. Claire Miles, managing director of customer operations at British Gas, said she recognised the latest announcement was difficult news for affected employees but said it was necessary to make the business more efficient. \u201cSince last summer British Gas has been implementing a strategy to improve service and reduce costs, to ensure we can price competitively. We must also respond to the changing needs of our customers, and they increasingly want to contact us online,\u201d she said. \u201cFor these reasons we are planning to consolidate our activity on fewer sites, and we have made the difficult decision to propose closing our Oldbury office and call centre.\u201d The work undertaken at the Oldbury office will be taken on by three existing sites, at Stockport, Leicester and Uddington, outside Glasgow. The chief executive, Iain Conn, announced last summer that he planned to cut 6,000 positions across the group, with 5,000 in Britain. The latest cuts announcement comes two days after the parent company, Centrica, admitted it had lost 220,000 British Gas domestic customers in the first three months of the year. The admission came at the company\u2019s annual general meeting where there was criticism of Conn\u2019s \u00a33m annual remuneration package awarded in 2015. All of the big six energy suppliers are under pressure as a result of falling power prices and increasing competition from a new generation of small independent companies such as First Utility, Ovo Energy and Ecotricity. Last year the residential gas business increased its profits but Centrica as a whole reported adjusted operating profits down 12% to \u00a31.5bn. Unions expressed deep concern at the latest cutbacks. Matt Lay, the national energy officer at Unison, said: \u201cThis is terrible news for the company\u2019s Birmingham-based employees, who will be devastated at the prospect of losing their jobs. British Gas might be losing customers, but it\u2019s still a very profitable business.\u201d Fuel Poverty Action, a campaign group for those struggling to pay their energy bills, claimed annual figures released in February showed the company was profiteering at the expense of hard-pressed consumers. The company has always denied this, although the Competition and Markets Authority has called for a series of changes in the way companies operate after concluding that energy bills were much higher than they need be.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The merger of Paddy Power and Betfair has seen the combined company join the FTSE 100, but analysts at Credit Suisse believe its share price performance has been overdone. Two months after the merger, which was completed at the start of February, Paddy Power Betfair announced 650 job cuts, but Credit Suisse says cost cutting is not the best reason for combining the two businesses. Analyst Ed Birkin said: We feel that cost synergies alone are a poor rationale for M&amp;A in a growth industry such as online gaming. Furthermore, we believe that scale is not as important as many believe, and is no indication of potential market share gains. With regards to Paddy Power and Betfair, as both companies already had strong brands, high quality management teams and good product/technology offerings, we question the extent of the benefits from a merger. We think the post-merger share price reaction has been overdone and, given the integration risk and limited revenue synergies, we initiate with an underperform rating and 8,650p target price (c.9% downside potential). The valuation looks expensive versus peers, with only 15% of the current enterprise value of Paddy Power Betfair being generated by cash flows over the next five years, compared to 29% for William Hill and 28% for Ladbrokes, on our numbers. The negative comments have helped send the company\u2019s shares down 250p to \u00a390.80. Birkin said there was potential for increased earnings from the the merger but said: The consensus view on Paddy Power Betfair is that its scale will allow it to make significant market share gains and achieve strong operational gearing.

      "bodyText": "The boss of the Port Talbot steelworks is working on a proposal to rescue Tata Steel\u2019s UK business through a management buyout. Stuart Wilkie, managing director of Tata\u2019s strip products business, which includes Port Talbot, is understood to have outlined his plans to staff and is now trying to raise the funds to launch a bid. A management buyout could be the best hope of securing the future of the Port Talbot steelworks. Sources close to Tata have warned there is a lack of interest in buying its entire UK business, which is losing \u00a31m a day. However, a management buyout is fraught with difficulties. Wilkie needs to raise substantial financial backing for his plan, either from private investors or the government. Wilkie is reported to have asked staff interested in his plans to contribute up to \u00a310,000 towards funding a deal. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said the government was willing to co-invest with a potential buyer, meaning it could support a management buyout. Other potential bidders for Tata Steel UK include Liberty House, Sanjeev Gupta\u2019s metal company; Greybull, the investment firm buying Tata\u2019s steelworks in Scunthorpe; and ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial conglomerate. Trade unions welcomed the news of Wilkie\u2019s interest but said they were yet to be contacted. A spokesperson for Community, the steelworkers\u2019 union said: \u201cWe welcome interest from all credible potential new owners. We are aware of reports that a management buyout is under consideration and would expect discussions with anyone considering leading such an initiative. \u201cWe are still in the very early stages of the sales process; however it is clear that significant interest in the business exists from a number of different potential buyers. This is a sign that a long\u2013term, profitable future for the industry is entirely possible.\u201d Around 40,000 jobs are at risk after Tata announced last month that it would pull out of the UK steel industry. This includes 15,000 jobs at Tata and 25,000 in the supply chain. The management buyout would activate a turnaround plan for Port Talbot, which was presented to Tata\u2019s board last month in a last-ditch attempt to persuade the Indian company to stick with the UK business. This plan \u2013 know as \u201cthe bridge\u201d \u2013 involves \u00a3100m being injected into the business immediately. It would keep the blast furnaces at Port Talbot \u2013 a key consideration for the government \u2013 and take two years to get the business back into profit. However, Tata rejected the plan as too risky, and any financial backer for the management buyout would need to support the proposals. Tata has approached almost 200 parties about potentially bidding for the business. It has declined to reveal the identity of interested parties, as has the government. The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes the Port Talbot plant, said he had always felt that management buyout was the right option in principle, but said it needed the right team and financial backing to work in practice. He said: \u201cThat is why the due diligence phase of the sale process will be so important, and why I am very concerned about the tight timeline that Tata Steel has set out. It is vital that Tata Steel delivers on its promise to be a responsible seller and that the government ensures that this is the case. \u201cThere are a number of credible buyers in the market, but sustainable success will only be achieved if the government starts to deliver something tangible on dumping, energy, procurement and business rates. Labour MPs have raised these issues 208 times in parliament since the general election, so there can be no more excuses . It is time for the government to act.\u201d",

Manufacturing is in recession, the housing market has been kept going by buy to let, the forward-looking surveys of business activity have been weakening. During this period, the unemployment figures have been one bright spot. The number of people in work has steadily increased and the jobless rate has slipped to 5.1%. It was, though, only a matter of time before the labour market caught up with the rest of the economy. That moment seems to have arrived. Without question, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics were poor. Unemployment rose on both measures used by the government \u2013 the internationally used labour force survey and the more narrowly focused claimant count. The 21,000 increase in the LFS measure was the first since July 2015. What\u2019s more, wage growth remains muted. Less generous City bonuses \u2013 down by more than 12% year on year \u2013 were the reason the headline annual increase in average earnings dropped from 2.1% to 1.8%. But even excluding bonuses there was no pick-up in the rate of pay growth in the three months ending in February. This remained at 2.2%, and with inflation starting to tick up, living standards are once again beginning to be squeezed. It would be easy, but wrong, to blame rising unemployment on the looming EU referendum. The period covered by the latest data \u2013 November 2015 to February 2016 \u2013 predates the decision by the government to hold an in-out vote. More likely explanations for the softening of the labour market are the easing off in global activity, the impact of tighter fiscal policy, and a waning in the sugar-rush boost to the economy provided in 2014 and early 2015 from the housing market. It is likely, however, that the referendum will have an impact over the coming months. Employers clearly became a bit more cautious about hiring staff at the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, and are likely to become even more so until the June 23 vote is out of the way. As far as interest rate decisions from the Bank of England are concerned, the message from the ONS data is plain: rising unemployment plus stagnant wage growth equals borrowing costs remaining where they are for many months to come.",

      "bodyText": "Mitsubishi Motors has admitted manipulating test data to overstate the fuel efficiency of 625,000 cars. The Japanese carmaker said the inaccurate tests covered four of its mini-cars, two of which it manufactured for Nissan. The number of Nissan cars affected was 468,000, while 157,000 were sold under the Mitsubishi brand. When Nissan tested the cars supplied by Mitsubishi Motors, it found differences between its figures and Mitsubishi\u2019s results. Nissan asked Mitsubishi Motors to investigate and this led the company to discover \u201cimproper conduct\u201d and tests that did not meet Japanese law. The company released the information in a statement as its president, Tetsuro Aikawa, held a news conference. He and other company officials bowed deeply at the start of the briefing. Mitsubishi Motors said: \u201cWe found that with respect to the fuel consumption testing data \u2026 MMC conducted testing improperly to present better fuel consumption rates than the actual rates and that the testing method was also different from the one required by Japanese law. We express deep apologies to all of our customers and stakeholders for this issue.\u201d Japan\u2019s sixth-biggest carmaker by market value said it and Nissan had stopped production of the cars and that it would discuss compensation with Nissan. Shares in Mitsubishi Motors, which is controlled by Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi conglomerate, dropped 15% in Tokyo \u2013 their biggest fall in almost 12 years. The incorrect testing method was used for other cars manufactured for the Japanese market and Mitsubishi Motors will now look at products made for overseas markets. The company will set up an investigation committee of outside experts, it said. Mitsubishi Motors joins Hyundai, Kia and Ford on the list of carmakers that have mishandled testing or reporting of their models\u2019 fuel economy. Hyundai and its Kia affiliate agreed to pay $350m (\u00a3244m) in 2014 to the US government for overstating vehicles\u2019 fuel economy ratings. Carmakers are under intense scrutiny about the claims they make for their vehicles after Volkswagen admitted last year that it rigged emissions tests. VW has set aside \u20ac6.7bn (\u00a34.8bn) to pay for the crisis and its shares are down about 30% since the scandal was revealed in September.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have slipped back after hitting new four month highs on Tuesday, hit by a drop in crude prices now the Kuwait oil strike is over, prompting renewed fears of oversupply amid falling demand. A slump in the Chinese market on fears of a clampdown by the authorities on excessive borrowing has not helped sentiment. But chip designer Arm is bucking the trend after better than expected first quarter figures, despite news overnight that semiconductor group Intel planned to slash 12,000 jobs worldwide and reported lower than expected earnings. Arm has reported a 14% rise in profits to \u00a3137.5m, and it said it expected full year results to be in line with expectations. The iPhone supplier, which has been hit recently by concerns of a slowdown in smartphone sales, said royalties had risen 15% year on year but down 2% quarter on quarter. It has moved into servers to boost growth, and should also benefit from the move to the Internet of Things. The positive results have seen Arm shares jump 2.8% to 990.5p. Analysts at Investec said: The outlook is intact, underpinned by a strong licences pipeline and continued shift to a higher royalty rate mix, yet valuation remains at the lower end of the historic range. This we believe supports our positive investment view based on the long-term attraction of Arm\u2019s business model and underpinned cash generation in the many years ahead. We retain our buy and a 1200p 2020 royalty driven target price. Liberum, a consistent seller of the shares, said: Don\u2019t expect much change to consensus estimates for 2016 - sterling revenue may nudge up (weaker pound) and operating expenditure is also likely to increase broadly offsetting each other. Hard to call the stock today. Typically sentiment towards Arm has been driven by royalty momentum which is soft. However the stock has been weak into results. Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 18.28 points to 6387.07, although mining shares have recovered some of their earlier losses in the wake of the fall in the Chinese stock market despite a 2% fall in Brent crude. Rio Tinto has risen 84.5p to 2417.5p, helped by positive comments from RBC, Investec and JP Morgan. A wave of upgrades from Investec has also given some support to other mining shares, including Antofagasta, up 17.2p to 510p and Anglo American, ahead 22.4p at 774.9p. Investec said: The rally during the first quarter of 2016 caught many observers off-guard, ourselves included. Fundamentals in China have mildly improved, but not to the extent that equity price moves can be fully justified. The rally can largely be explained by dollar weakness and improved sentiment on the China growth outlook - hence we expect commodity prices to be primarily driven by these factors in the near term... [We have] a mild positive bias toward the sector, although we caution that the industry still faces some serious challenges: primarily on-going balance sheet concerns. Our recommendation is to buy whenever prices dip below value points. The bottom of the market appears to have been tested and found, but we do not see this as the beginning of a renewed bull market. Among the fallers, BT is down 10.05p at 441.05p as Jefferies cut from buy to hold. It said: BT\u2019s outlook appears increasingly uncertain, with more elements outside management control. The positive view we established in 2010 was founded on benign regulation (helping BT regain consumer retail momentum) and substantial cost-cutting. With neither support looking so reliable now and valuation no longer cheap, we downgrade to hold. Lower down the market home shopping group N. Brown has dropped 40.6p to 27i5p following a 2% drop in full year profits to \u00a384.5m and a cautious outlook for the current year, with margins hit by exchange rates and the clearance of old inventory. Peel Hunt analysts said: N Brown\u2019s transformation programme is now two years in and our forecast pretax profit for next year sits 20% below where we started from. The scale of investment and change required has been significant, arguably greater than management or the market realised two years ago. However, as we downgrade forecasts again, we have little confidence that the business will show meaningful traction and we cut to reduce [from hold] noting better recovery opportunities elsewhere. Meanwhile Stifel said: Full year results are in line, but trading weakened significantly in the tail end of the year and has remained weak, with sales declines to date in the new financial year. While management is confident that some of the trading weakness can normalise, it is clear that market conditions are tough. This is further reflected in guidance of a significant product gross margin decline for 2017, impacted by foreign exchange and the need to invest in price to gain share. Systems investments are on track but will see big changes this year and management warns of potential \u201cbumps in the road\u201d. While the shares are not expensive and could well fall in line with earnings downgrades today, we think they fairly reflect the balance of risks and hence we retain a hold recommendation.",

      "bodyText": "Senior staff from Tata Steel\u2019s Port Talbot factory are expected to announce a management buyout plan for the plant. Stuart Wilkie, the managing director of Tata Strip Products UK, was named as the leader of a group of managers who are looking for private investors and government support for their plan, which they are tipped to unveil on Wednesday. The proposal is based on a \u201cturnaround plan\u201d presented to but rejected by the board of Tata, according to ITV News, which said that the bid would require funding of \u00a3100m. Tata employees could be asked to invest as much as \u00a310,000 each. The government said that it welcomed any interest in Tata Steel UK\u2019s assets. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \u201cWe are doing everything we can to help the steel industry secure a long-term viable future and welcome any interest from potential bidders, as we have outlined.\u201d Tata said last month that it was selling its UK steel businesses, leaving thousands of jobs in the balance at plants across the country. More than 190 potential investors have been approached about purchasing the business, the Indian company has said. The option of a management buyout has a strong degree of support among some workers and others campaigning to keep the steelworks open. The only bidder to publicly express an interest is Sanjeev Gupta, the owner of commodity trader Liberty House. He has sought state backing to help rescue Tata Steel\u2019s UK assets and has lobbied for political support to reject any plans for a management buyout of the Port Talbot plant. An investment firm, Greybull, is buying Tata\u2019s long products business in a move that will revive the British Steel brand and could save up to 4,400 jobs. However, the deal does not include the Port Talbot steelworks or the rest of Tata\u2019s UK business, which employs about 15,000 people. Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes the Port Talbot plant, said he had always felt that management buyout was the right option in principle, but said it needed the right team and financial backing to work in practice. \u201cThat is why the due diligence phase of the sale process will be so important, and why I am very concerned about the tight timeline that Tata Steel has set out. It is vital that Tata Steel delivers on its promise to be a responsible seller and that the government ensures that this is the case.\u201d He said the employees were ready to work with any potential investors and urged the government to be prepared to offer the necessary support. \u201cThere are a number of credible buyers in the market, but sustainable success will only be achieved if the government starts to deliver something tangible on dumping, energy, procurement and business rates. Labour MPs have raised these issues 208 times in parliament since the general election, so there can be no more excuses, it is time for the government to act.\u201d",

He has sought state backing to help rescue Tata Steel\u2019s UK assets and has lobbied for political support to reject any plans for a management buyout of the Port Talbot plant.</p> <p>An investment firm, Greybull, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/11/tata-steel-deal-saves-4400-uk-jobs\">buying Tata\u2019s long products business</a> in a move that will revive the British Steel brand and could save up to 4,400 jobs.</p> <p>However, the deal does not include the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/port-talbot-steel-plant-tata-meeting-mumbai\">Port Talbot steelworks</a> or the rest of Tata\u2019s UK business, which employs about 15,000 people.</p> <p>Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes the Port Talbot plant, said he had always felt that management buyout was the right option in principle, but said it needed the right team and financial backing to work in practice. <br></p> <p>\u201cThat is why the due diligence phase of the sale process will be so important, and why I am very concerned about the tight timeline that Tata Steel has set out. It is vital that Tata Steel delivers on its promise to be a responsible seller and that the government ensures that this is the case.\u201d</p> <p>He said the employees were ready to work with any potential investors and urged the government to be prepared to offer the necessary support. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere are a number of credible buyers in the market, but sustainable success will only be achieved if the government starts to deliver something tangible on dumping, energy, procurement and business rates. Labour MPs have raised these issues 208 times in parliament since the general election, so there can be no more excuses, it is time for the government to act.\u201d</p>",
