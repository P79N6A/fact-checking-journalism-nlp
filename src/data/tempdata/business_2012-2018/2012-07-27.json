      "bodyText": "\"Made in China\" is usually what it says on clothing labels, but ambitious Chinese retailers are now looking to make their own brands household names in the UK. The high street is the latest target of the deep-pocketed Chinese, who are on a buying spree in Britain and have already taken stakes in companies as diverse as Thames Water, Weetabix and Savile Row tailor Gieves &amp; Hawkes. Chinese fashion giant Bosideng opened its first store in the UK in the West End of London this week to cash in on the influx of visitors for the Olympics, while Chinese fashion label Eve said it wanted to become \"the Chinese McQueen\" and is heading to London next year. Bosideng, with sales of more than \u00a3800m last year and more than 8,000 stores, is as well known in China as Marks &amp; Spencer is here, and is best known for its colourful down-filled \"puffa\" jackets. It has ploughed \u00a335m into the six-storey store and plans to use the upper floors as the headquarters for its burgeoning European operation. With most British high street retailers reliant on Chinese factories to produce low cost clothing, Bosideng is swimming against the tide with only 10% of the UK clothing range made in China. Bosideng UK chief executive Wayne Zhu said it had been studying the European market for some time and predicted other Chinese groups would follow. \"I know of other Chinese retailers doing feasibility studies\", he said. Unlike its vast domestic operation, which also sells womenswear and childrenswear, Bosideng's UK offering is upmarket menswear aimed at the customers of brands such as Paul Smith and Hugo Boss. Zhu said the brand wanted to win over Europeans rather than target wealthy Chinese shoppers already familiar with the brand. \"We are a Chinese brand, designed in the UK and made for Europe,\" he said. To get its product right Bosideng worked with designers Nick Holland and Ash Gangotra who recently collaborated with ex-Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher on his label Pretty Green. \"The brand draws on Chinese history and inspiration but also has a UK feel to it,\" added its retail director Jason Denmark. \"We have to make a collection that's right for the European market if we are to succeed. International retailers have sometimes misfired on entering the UK. It took Uniqlo two attempts to get its ranges and store locations right, while chains such as the Inditex owned Zara had to tweak its sizing after they failed to take account of different body shapes in new markets. Bosideng's debut in London came as the government courted Chinese entrepreneurs at a conference in the capital \u2013 one of 17 summits scheduled over the next fortnight to attract investment and promote British business. The centrepiece of the event was a catwalk show by fashion label Eve which became the first Chinese men's clothing brand to show at London fashion week. Run by Xia Hua, a former politics professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, the brand intends to invest \u00a310m in a London head office next year. \"We would like to be the Chinese McQueen,\" said Hua, who added the retailer was in talks with Harrods and Selfridges. \"There are a lot of western brands that go to China and achieve business success but not that many Chinese brands that have succeeded in western markets. I would like to see high quality Chinese products on the [British] high street. Not just made in China but designed in China.\"",

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on Friday pledged a joint determination to save the euro as they sought to quash fears in the world's financial markets that the deepening economic woes of Spain would put the single currency at risk. The show of support from the German chancellor and the French president helped extend the rally on Europe's financial markets into a second day and was enough to divert attention from dismal Spanish unemployment figures and a warning from the International Monetary Fund that Spain's deepening crisis posed a threat to monetary union. Spain's borrowing costs for its 10-year bonds dropped to 6.76% \u2013 a percentage point drop on the levels seen earlier in the week \u2013 while the Ibex index of shares in Madrid closed more than 3% higher. In Rome, where the Italian government extended its ban on the short selling of shares \u2013 the process whereby investors sell stocks they do not own in the hope of buying them back more cheaply later, the FTSE MIB rose by 3%. On the foreign exchanges the euro climbed to almost \u20ac1.24 against the US dollar. Share prices in London and New York also gained ground. \"France and Germany are fundamentally tied to the integrity of the euro area,\" Merkel and Hollande said in their statement after a telephone call between the two leaders. \"They are determined to do everything to protect it. Member states and European institutions must fulfil their obligations to this end, according to their prerogatives.\" With the German Bundesbank again warning the European Central Bank against exceeding its mandate in an attempt to help beleaguered eurozone countries, there was confusion in the markets as to when and how the verbal show of support for Spain would be put into action. The government in Madrid strongly denied a report from Reuters that a meeting in Berlin on Tuesday between the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and his Spanish counterpart, Luis de Guindos, had discussed a \u20ac300bn (\u00a3236bn) package of financial support. Spain's unprecedented double dip recession will last for at least a further 18 months and poses a threat to the rest of Europe, the IMF said. Predicting a lost decade of growth for the eurozone's fourth biggest economy, the Washington-based fund said the outlook was \"very difficult\" and the fresh austerity measures announced by the government of the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, would have \"a significant impact on growth\". In its annual Article 4 health check, the IMF predicted it would take until 2017 for national output to return to its 2007 level, before the global financial crisis hit. It said: \"Spain is facing mounting market pressure and costly market access, with possibly negative repercussions for the rest of Europe, amid the longer term challenge of unwinding imbalances that built up during several years of excess private sector spending.\" Official figures released in Madrid on Friday showed that Spain's unemployment rate hit record levels in the second quarter of this year, leaving one in four of the working population without a job as austerity continued to bite and fears of a national bailout grew. Figures released by the country's national statistics institute revealed that the second quarter, traditionally a time when employment picks up for the tourism season, saw joblessness rise to 24.6% as 53,000 more people joined dole queues. That broke a record set during Spain's last major recession 18 years ago. More than 5.7 million Spaniards are unemployed. The under-25s are suffering most, with 53% of jobseekers unable to find work.

      "bodyText": "Barclays was engulfed by a fresh crisis on Friday when it admitted that its finance director, Chris Lucas, is under investigation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in relation to funds raised in 2008. The latest potential run-in with the regulators comes as the bank scrambles to pick up the pieces over the Libor rate-fixing scandal, which has already led to the resignations of four top directors at the bank. As it announced \u00a3759m in pre-tax profits, down 71% from \u00a32.6bn last year, the bank suggested that the FSA was investigating whether all the fees had been disclosed in two fundraisings that took place to help the bank avoid a bailout by the taxpayer. Barclays sources insisted that it did not involve payments to any current or former staff. The FSA had \"commenced an investigation involving Barclays and four current and former senior employees, including Chris Lucas\", the bank said. \"The FSA is investigating the sufficiency of disclosure in relation to fees payable under certain commercial agreements and whether these may have related to Barclays capital raisings in June and November 2008.

Another paragraph says: \"Barclays and Qatar Holding have entered into an agreement for the provision of advisory services by Qatar Holding to Barclays in the Middle East.\" The total fees disclosed were about \u00a3100m. In the separate November 2008 fundraising, it provided five separate disclosures of fees that amounted in total to around \u00a3300m. Agius resigned in the wake of the Libor scandal, but was temporarily reinstated when chief executive Bob Diamond was forced out by regulators. Agius had been expected to appoint the new chief executive, but said that his successor would be named before Diamond's replacement. Agius refused to let Lucas respond to questions about whether he had offered to resign over the Libor scandal. \"We are sorry for the issues that have emerged over recent weeks and recognise that we have disappointed our customers and shareholders.

      "bodyText": "BP must pay its joint venture TNK-BP $3bn (\u00a31.8bn) in damages over an aborted deal to partner Russia's state oil firm Rosneft in an Arctic exploration, a Siberian court has ruled. The ruling against the oil giant, which it will appeal against, led to the company's lawyer saying the reputation of the Russian judiciary was severely damaged. The company is desperately trying to leave Russia and has put its 50% stake in TNK-BP up for sale, with Rosneft the only company to confirm it is interested in buying the entire stake, worth up to $30bn. The Siberian case was bought by minority shareholder, Andrey Prokhorov, who has claimed a linkup between Rosneft and BP damaged the value of TNK-BP, which is a 50:50 partnership with the London-based firm and a group of Russian oligarchs, Alfa Access-Renova (AAR). The fine was announced as TNK-BP reported net profits in the last three months had fallen by over 60% to $808m, from $2.2bn a year ago. It is the fourth court case brought by Prokhorov, after his first case where he claimed $16bn damages was thrown out last year. He twice appealed to higher courts in Russia and eventually had the case referred back to the original Tyumen arbitration court, which has now ruled that $3bn damages be paid to TNK-BP. The decision comes less than a month after AAR said it would be interested in buying half of BP's stake in the venture for $10bn, made up of $7bn cash and $3bn from an agreement to waive a lawsuit over the Rosneft partnership. A spokesman for BP said: \"We consider the court decision as unjustified. Today's ruling will be challenged in the court of appeal.

We consider this claim as an attempted corporate attack and believe that today's ruling should be cancelled.\" BP's lawyer, Konstantin Lukoyanov, added: \"The court award seriously damages the reputation of the Russian legal system and its ability to protect the rights of bona fide investors from illegal corporate attacks.\" Animosities between BP and AAR over TNK-BP started last year when Rosneft and BP announced a joint venture to start Arctic exploration. Rosneft was to receive 5% of BP's shares, worth $7.8bn, and BP 9.5% of Rosneft's shares. However, AAR secured an injunction stopping the deal after arguing that it breached the TNK-BP shareholder agreement that said future Russian opportunities must be pursued together. BP tried to buy out AAR last year for $32bn, with Rosneft as its partner, but the deal fell apart at the last minute. It is currently in a 90-day buyout period where it will hold negotiations with both AAR and Rosneft to agree a deal. Earlier this week Russian news agency Interfax reported one AAR shareholder saying: \"I don't see any big problem if BP takes the decision to sell its stake in TNK-BP to Rosneft.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European Central Bank president Mario Draghi prompted a strong rally in Europe's financial markets when he pledged to do \"whatever it takes\" to safeguard the future of the single currency. Shares, bonds and the euro all rose sharply after the ECB president dropped the strongest of hints that the bank was preparing to intervene to bring down the crippling borrowing costs affecting the Spanish and Italian governments. In what was seen as the start of a power struggle with Germany's Bundesbank, Draghi told a UK government-backed pre-Olympics business conference in London that the ECB had the legal right to act if the high bond yields caused by Europe's sovereign debt crisis were making its interest rate policy less effective. Germany has argued that the ECB has no legal right to copy the aggressively interventionist policies adopted by the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England, but Draghi said: \"Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro \u2026 And believe me, it will be enough.\" He added: \"To the extent that the size of these sovereign premia [high bond yields] hamper the functioning of the monetary policy transmission channel, they come within our mandate \u2026 we have to cope with the financial fragmentation and address these issues.\" Financial markets rallied instantly on Draghi's comments. Interest rates on Spanish 10-year bonds, which had peaked at 7.75% this week, dropped below 7%, while Italy's 10-year bond yield slipped below 6%. Financial markets believe long-term borrowing costs of more than 7% are unsustainable and will eventually require a country to seek financial help. On the currency markets, the euro gained almost two cents against the dollar at just under $1.23, while the Madrid and Milan stock markets rose 6%. Hopes of ECB action to tackle the sovereign debt crisis also boosted sentiment in London, where the FTSE 100 climbed 75 points; in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 212 points (1.7%) at 12,888. \"These are potentially very significant remarks from the ECB president,\" said Nick Parsons, analyst at National Australia Bank. \"Until now we've had a none too subtle public row between the inflationary hardliners in the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank. \"Draghi has been heavily criticised by Buba [Bundesbank] chief Jens Weidmann but appears now to be publicly fighting back in defence of his vision of how monetary policy can \u2013 and will \u2013 operate in this era of sovereign debt crisis.\" Parsons said he expected the ECB to massively increase bond purchases in the financial markets, adding that it was possible Draghi was also preparing to buy bonds directly from governments, a course of action fiercely opposed by Germany. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, said the timing of Draghi's comments were significant. \"My suspicion is that he knows something we don't.\" Christian Schulz, senior economist at the German bank Berenberg, said the announcement could boost sentiment, but immediate action was unlikely. \"The ECB is the only institution that can credibly arrest any market panic, because it can act swiftly and has potentially unlimited pockets. The ECB might still wait for the decisions eurozone leaders may take on Greece and Spain in September after the permanent rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, has been established. The uncertainty may continue for some time.\" Nick Spiro, from Spiro Sovereign Strategy, expressed scepticism about the ECB's capacity to deliver. \"Markets love to hear 'do whatever it takes' utterances from Europe's leaders whenever the eurozone crisis takes a turn for the worse. But they are particularly fond of hints from the ECB that it is looking at ways to overcome legal and political constraints to shoring up the bond markets of Spain and Italy \u2013 the issue which has concerned investors the most over the past year.\" The IMF welcome Draghi's remarks but its managing director, Christine Lagarde, said the eurozone needed to deliver on commitments to deeper integration agreed at the summit in June. \"The eurozone needs a coherent fiscal, monetary and banking union if it is to overcome the sovereign debt crisis,\" she said. \"This coagulation of member states does not translate into one single economic fiscal union. What happened on the 28 and 29 of June was welcome but it was step number one and it needs to be delivered upon.\" Lagarde also seemed to push for greater political integration, but recognised the difficulties politicians faced in selling that to their voters. \"It takes more than courage to go forward and say: 'I'm surrendering part of my sovereignty; decisions on defence, decisions on budget and decisions on raising tax will be compounded by 16 other states; our banks will be supervised by the ECB.' That is a tough call.\" IMF officials were involved in talks in Athens with the Greek government over new austerity measures being demanded in return for financial help. Cuts in pensions and healthcare were under discussion when the so-called troika of the IMF, ECB and EU began negotiations. Manuel Barroso, the EU president, also attended, in an attempt to defuse speculation that Greece may be forced out of monetary union. Government officials said they saw the massed forces as an endorsement of the new Greek administration's determination to enforce unpopular changes on an economy that has lost close to 20% of GDP since its first bailout in May 2010. The EU president urged Athens to push ahead with the reforms, emphasising that while the will exists to keep Greece in the bloc, it also had to show willing if patience is not to run out with the debt-choked country. Media reports suggest Barroso will press the government to expedite the privatisation of loss-making state-owned utilities \u2013 a programme that has barely got off the ground despite it being a cornerstone of Athens's loan agreement with international creditors. Although lenders have pledged to tide Greece over with a bridging loan if necessary to cover refinancing needs in August, further cash handouts will depend on the progress Athens is perceived to have made in enacting reforms. Aides close to Antonis Samaras say the Greek prime minister will use the occasion to extract a message of \"solidarity and support\" from Barroso that the government, barely four weeks old, is intent on meeting the commitments it has made to creditors. \"We are very tired of constantly being portrayed as the problem child of Europe,\" said one insider. \"Remarks questioning our ability to stay the course are very unuseful.\" This week, Samaras chastised \"certain EU countries\" for what he described as the \"constant undermining\" of Greece when it was trying to extract itself from an economic mire.",

Customers of the building society \u2013 which has about four million current account holders \u2013 who had used their debit cards to make payments on Tuesday, found that their accounts had been debited a second time the following day.
