      "bodyText": "The UK housing market is continuing to slow down, with falling property sales, \u201cstagnant\u201d buyer demand and general election uncertainty all adding up to one of the most downbeat reports issued by surveyors since the financial crash. In its latest monthly snapshot of the market, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said momentum was \u201ccontinuing to ebb,\u201d with no sign of change in the near future. Its report is the latest in a series of recent surveys suggesting that the slowdown is getting worse as household budgets continue to be squeezed and affordability pressures bite. It comes days after the Halifax said house prices fell by 0.1% in April, which meant they were nearly \u00a33,000 below their December 2016 peak. Nationwide reported a bigger decline in April \u2013 it said prices fell by 0.4%, following a 0.3% drop in March. Some parts of London appear to have been hit particularly hard, with estate agents and developers resorting to offering free cars and other incentives to try to tempt buyers. Rics said its members had reported that sales were slipping slightly following months of flat transactions. A lack of choice for would-be buyers across the UK appears to be one of the major factors putting a dampener on sales: the latest report said there was \u201can acute shortage of stock,\u201d with the typical number of properties on estate agents\u2019 books hovering close to record lows. New instructions continue to drop, which could make the situation worse: the flow of fresh listings to agents remained negative for the 14th month in a row at a national level, said Rics, though it added that the situation had apparently improved slightly in London. At the same time, enquiries from new buyers remained flat in April and had failed to see any meaningful growth since November 2016. Despite the subdued backdrop, the Rics report said house prices were continuing to rise nationally, with the pace of growth steady over the last five months, though there were regional variations, with central London having been in \u201cnegative territory\u201d for 13 months in a row. This finding follows a recent claim from a leading property-finding firm that the once super-heated central London market had turned into a \u201cburnt-out core\u201d. The Rics members surveyed predicted that UK property price inflation would slow during the next three months, but despite this, they were anticipating that all parts of the country would see some growth in prices during the next 12 months. \u201cAnecdotal evidence cites a lack of choice, uncertainty due to the calling of an early election, and the ramifications of stamp duty changes as factors hampering activity,\u201d said the organisation. Simon Rubinsohn, Rics chief economist, added that its data pointed to \u201ca fairly flat summer for both activity and prices. Lack of stock on the market remains a key challenge for the sector\u201d. Separate research issued on Wednesday showed that despite the gloom, homeowners were continuing to keep the faith when it came to property prices in their area. The data from property website Zoopla showed that 87% of British homeowners believed that homes in their region would grow in value over the next six months. It also found there had been a fall in the number of those planning to buy or sell a property. Lawrence Hall, a spokesman for the website, said: \u201cWith the upcoming general election, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that people may be holding out to make a purchase or sale decision until after 8 June.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays under fire for his attempts to unmask a whistleblower, has admitted to hundreds of shareholders that he made a mistake and has issued a personal apology for his behaviour. The American banker told 460 investors at Barclays\u2019 AGM that he had made an error in trying to reveal the identity of the individual making allegations about the previous conduct of a newly hired executive in the US. Staley said: \u201cI feel it is important that I acknowledge to you \u2013 our shareholders \u2013 that I made a mistake in becoming involved in an issue which I should have left to the business to deal with. I apologised to the board, and I would today like to apologise to you as well for that error.\u201d However, about 17% of investors failed to back his re-election to the board, after ISS, an influential adviser to institutional investors, issued an \u201cabstain\u201d recommendation on the vote. The protest was largely through deliberate abstentions: only 3% voted against his continued boardroom role at the bank he joined in December 2015. Even so, the abstentions are an embarrassment to Staley, who was hired in 2015 after John McFarlane, the bank\u2019s chairman, ousted the previous chief executive, Antony Jenkins. Chief executives usually aim for resounding endorsements of their boardroom roles. At the AGM in the Royal Festival Hall, London, one private investor called on Staley to quit over the events, which were revealed last month when Barclays admitted that its chief executive had twice attempted to unmask a whistleblower. The whistleblower\u2019s allegations concerned Tim Main, who worked with Staley at JP Morgan and who was recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June. Another private investor asked what action Staley intended to take if he had uncovered the whistleblower. \u201cWhat was he going to do? Presumably not put him into a suitcase [and put] him into the river,\u201d the shareholder asked, saying McFarlane must feel as if he had \u201cwandered on to the stage of a Carry On film\u201d. McFarlane \u2013 who has a reputation for firing chief executives \u2013 has repeatedly backed Staley. \u201cYou know me,\u201d McFarlane said, \u201cif I believe the CEO should go \u2026 [he would].\u201d The chairman likened the matter to a driving offence. McFarlane said the chief executive \u201cthought he had a green light. He went through the light and actually it was red\u201d. \u201cThe action for going through a red light ... is you don\u2019t lose your licence.\u201d Providing more details about the situation, McFarlane said the bank thought the allegations had been raised in a external letter from the US, rather than from an employee. Even so, he said, the bank had treated the matter as a whistleblowing incident \u2013 although McFarlane said many issues raised by whistleblowers are not found to be valid. Both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority are investigating the matter. Barclays has formally reprimanded Staley and insisted that his bonus, which was \u00a31.4m last year, will be cut. The incident took place around July last year when the rules covered only internal whistleblowing incidents, not external ones, McFarlane said. The rules changed three months later to cover external whistleblowing, too. At an annual meeting that also heard concerns about climate change and the automation of banking sevices, McFarlane admitted that executive pay was too high. Asked about remarks by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn describing bankers as \u201cgreedy\u201d, McFarlane retorted that it \u201cwas well known that politicians have impeccable judgment on all matters\u201d. Two votes on the bank\u2019s remuneration report and policy were easily passed, although changes to the long-term incentive plan failed to secure the support of 15% of investors. There was also a protest against the election of Sir Ian Cheshire, former boss of Kingfisher, which owns B&amp;Q. About 12% of investors voted against his appointment because of concerns about his time commitment. Cheshire also chairs retailer Debenhams, French furniture company Maisons du Monde and investment company Menhaden Capital, and is senior independent director at Costa Coffee owner Whitbread.",

      "bodyText": "The chairman of arms manufacturer BAE Systems repeatedly declined to say whether the company\u2019s employees are loading bombs on to Saudi Tornado jets involved in the conflict in Yemen. Sir Roger Carr was confronted by activists at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on Wednesday over BAE Systems\u2019 operations in Saudi Arabia and its recently announced \u00a3100m jet deal with Turkey. \u201cWe supply equipment and we maintain equipment, but we are not involved in any military action,\u201d he said. BAE Systems staff in the country are \u201clooking after the aircraft to make sure they can perform to the specification\u201d. The activists, from Campaign Against the Arms Trade, cited a job ad posted by BAE Systems in Saudi Arabia for a weapons loading technician for the Tornado jets the company maintains for the Saudi air force. Carr said all war is \u201cterrible\u201d and quoted Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s maxim about diplomacy: \u201cIt\u2019s best to speak softly but talk with a big stick,\u201d he said. \u201cWe provide the stick, but we hope that these talks succeed and the politics resolve the crisis [in Yemen] ... war helps no one. The sooner it stops, the better.\u201d For the past two years, Saudi Arabia has led a coalition of nations carrying out thousands of airstrikes in Yemen aimed at suppressing an insurgency by Houthi rebels. The campaign has been criticised by organisations including the United Nations for repeatedly targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. The Saudi air force, which has carried out the bulk of the attacks, relies substantially on technical support and maintenance provided by BAE Systems under a government-to-government contract with the UK. A judgment is expected soon in a court case challenging the British government\u2019s decision to keep granting export licences to Saudi Arabia despite mounting concerns about the toll of the strikes. The Saudi-led campaign is an act of self-defence against terrorism, Carr said. \u201cThis is not an aggressor: this is a defender ... They are protecting themselves.\u201d The company relies on the British government\u2019s judgments about whether weapons it manufactures will be used to breach human rights, Carr said: \u201cWe are not arbiters: we are suppliers of equipment under a contract.\u201d Asked whether BAE Systems is concerned by Turkey\u2019s recent moves towards authoritarianism and by its cooling relationship with Nato, he said: \u201cWe have to deal with things as they are today and not speculate too much on what they may or may not be tomorrow.\u201d It is the British government\u2019s responsibility to keep a \u201cweather eye\u201d on Turkey\u2019s relationship with Nato, he said: \u201cIf the government recognises or believes that things are changing ... I\u2019m sure they will respond and react.\u201d BAE Systems saw a \u00a31.1bn rise in its sales last year to \u00a319bn, which the company attributed to the fall in sterling following the EU referendum.",

If the EU insists that certain types of financial business take place within its jurisdiction, more jobs will plainly have to go.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Noel Edmonds has demanded \u00a373m in compensation from Lloyds Banking Group for what he claims was the destruction of his business empire together with public humiliation and damage to his reputation caused by the fraudulent activities of the bank\u2019s HBOS Reading arm. In a letter to the Lloyds chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, lawyers for the TV presenter allege that he \u201csuffered immense economic loss as well as (to put it very mildly) \u2018distress and inconvenience\u2019 at the hands of your bank as a direct result of the actions\u201d of the individuals involved in the fraud at the Berkshire branch. Six people were jailed in February after a jury heard they spent the proceeds of their fraudulent activities on superyachts and sex parties, while destroying businesses they had lent money to. Among them was the former HBOS banker Mark Dobson, who was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison and is referred to in the letter sent to Horta-Os\u00f3rio by Edmonds\u2019 lawyer Jonathan Coad at Keystone Law. The letter said: \u201cThese individuals were fraudsters whose corrupt activities also resulted in losses to my client of tens of millions of pounds, along with his suffering deep distress and public humiliation.\u201d Lloyds has set aside \u00a3100m to compensate 64 victims of the HBOS Reading fraud, although this sum may need to be increased if Edmonds is successful in his claim against the bank for fraudulent activities that took place between 2003 and 2007. Former DJ and children\u2019s TV presenter Edmonds, who presented Deal or No Deal from 2005 to 2016, said: \u201cI confirm my lawyers have sent a detailed claim letter seeking compensation from Lloyds for the losses that I suffered as a result of fraud committed against me by one of its managers. The biggest part of the claim is \u00a350m to cover the losses he incurred when his business, Unique Group, collapsed. Edmonds says the bankers\u2019 actions destroyed the entertainment firm and robbed him of future growth. He is also claiming \u00a312m for loss of speaking fees, \u00a3100,000 for \u201cpain, suffering and damage\u201d to his reputation and \u00a3750,000 in legal fees. \u201cI am now trusting that Mr Horta-Os\u00f3rio is true to his word and ensures that I am \u2018fairly, swiftly and appropriately\u2019 compensated for both the destruction of my businesses and the significant damage to my reputation. If he is not, then I will pursue my claim against Lloyds via the courts.\u201d Dobson worked for Lynden Scourfield, a former HBOS banker who pleaded guilty to charges relating to his role in the fraud and was jailed along with his business associate David Mills. The court heard that Scourfield gave inappropriate loans to businesses, which allowed Mills and his associates to profit from high consultancy fees, while the banker was rewarded with foreign cruises and sex parties. Edmonds\u2019 move comes as Horta-Os\u00f3rio prepares for Lloyds\u2019 annual general meeting on Thursday, days before the government will be able to claim that the 43% shareholding bought by taxpayers to rescue the bank in 2008 has been entirely sold off. The HBOS fraud predates the rescue by Lloyds during the financial crisis, but an investigation is under way into whether Lloyds looked into the problems in Reading and reported them to authorities when it took over HBOS. Edmonds claims that Dobson effectively became a shadow director of one his businesses, Unique, which was involved in a wide range of activities including Proms in the Park. The former Noel\u2019s House Party host claims HBOS prevented him from selling shares in another business, UBC, which would have helped repay a loan to HBOS. \u201cHad the sale of shares in UBC not been blocked, then the Unique bank accounts would have been in the black to the tune of about \u00a31m,\u201d Edmonds\u2019 lawyer said. \u201cThis figure is substantially more than the sum then claimed by HBOS, which in turn led to our client being the subject of legal proceedings based on the personal guarantee that had been demanded of him by HBOS, including the substantial \u2018exit fee\u2019 that was wrongly levied against Unique.\u201d The aim was to force Unique into the Quayside business run by Mills, the letter said. Coad, representing Edmonds, said: \u201cNoel has waited 10 years to see justice done after his business empire was brought down by Mr Dobson\u2019s fraud, and if the Lloyds review process does not provide the recompense due to Noel, then all the necessary ordinance, including litigation funding, is in place to start legal proceedings.\u201d Lloyds said the \u00a3100m compensation pot could be increased if necessary. \u201cAs stated when we announced the provision, this is what is currently anticipated as compensation for the 64 customers in the review,\u201d it said. \u201cIf the review determines that the level of compensation due requires us to increase the provision, then we will absolutely do so.\u201d Lloyds did not confirm receipt of the letter. Edmonds is thought to be one of the 64 customers in the review.",

      "bodyText": "The talking point in the dealing rooms was Donald Trump\u2019s sudden sacking of FBI director James Comey, but the actual effect on the market was rather more limited. In Europe shares moved higher, and there was a similar story in the UK, while the decline in the US was fairly muted. An initial drop in the dollar did not last, and the pound\u2019s move higher towards $1.30 was soon nipped in the bud as dealers looked forward to the Bank of England meeting on Thursday, expected to be fairly dovish. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 43.03 points or 0.59% at 7385.24 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.07% to 12,757.46 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.05% higher at 5400.46 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended 0.31% better at 21,552.81 But Spain\u2019s Ibex dipped 0.13% to 11,034.8 In Greece, the Athens market closed higher for the twelfth day in a row, up 1.75% at 791.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 20 points or 0.1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Brent crude is now above $50 a barrel and on course for its best day since 1 December. It has jumped more than 3% to $50.27 in the wake of the bigger than expected drop in US crude stocks. West Texas Intermediate is currently up 3.44% at $47.46 a barrel. Still with oil, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: On a day largely devoid of major economic announcements, US crude inventories have grabbed the headlines late into the session. The EIA posted the largest drawdown of 2017 to date. Yesterday\u2019s API figure once more provided us with a useful guide to where we could see today\u2019s EIA number. Despite recent fears that OPEC\u2019s output cuts may not be having an effect on inventories, it is clear that despite the odd outlier, the trend since the early February high has been towards reductions in stocks. Oil prices are moving higher following news of a bigger than expected decline in US crude stocks last week. They fell by 5.25m barrels to 522.53m, according to the Energy Information Administration, much higher than the forecast 1.8m decline. However gasoline stocks slipped by less than expected. But signs of increasing demand at a time when producers are struggling to contain supplies - Opec\u2019s cutbacks are being countered by rising US shale production - have lifted crude prices. Brent is up 2.2% at $49.81 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate has added a similar amount to $46.89. The EIA figures followed a report from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showing a bigger than expected fall of 5.8m barrels last week compared to forecasts of a 2m barrel reduction. The news saw crude prices rally initially. However, gains were capped due to news of a large build in gasoline stockpiles. Wall Street\u2019s reaction to the Comey sacking can hardly be described as dramatic (unlike the circumstances of the event itself). The US market falls are limited, and the dollar has recovered ground. The pound, for example, having looked as if it was going to breach the $1.3 level for the first time since September, is now down 0.02% at $1.2931. Investors are of course keeping Thursday\u2019s Bank of England meeting in mind, with the expectation that rates will remain unchanged and fading talk of a hawkish outlook. Meanwhile in Europe, markets are moving higher, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.17% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 0.06%. The FTSe 100 is currently up 0.67%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Comey controversy continued to be the main topic of discussion this Wednesday, though its impact on the market faded as the afternoon went on. The Dow Jones kicked off the US session 50 points lower, an improvement on the 80 point drop promised by the futures at points during the morning. The dollar also recovered the majority of its losses... That means Trump\u2019s dismissal of the FBI director has transitioned from pressing concern to mild annoyance in the eyes of investors, if not for the health of American democracy. The shrinking of sterling\u2019s growth was a boost to the FTSE, which surged 40 points higher this Wednesday, nearing 7400 for the first time in a month. The thrust of the index\u2019s momentum stems from the commodity sector; with Brent Crude tickling $49.50 per barrel BP and Shell both leapt 1% higher, while the mining stocks ignored copper\u2019s stagnation to instead focus on gold\u2019s gains. Tomorrow will push the pound back into the spotlight, however, as the Bank of England both votes on interest rates and reveals its latest inflation report. In the eurozone the DAX and CAC eventually shook off their early losses...And though Mario Draghi\u2019s address to the Dutch House of Representatives didn\u2019t necessarily go down well \u2013 the ECB chief was handed a solar-powered tulip to remind him of the world\u2019s first financial crisis \u2013 it didn\u2019t make much difference to investors. As expected following the news that FBI director James Comey had been \u201cterminated\u201d by President Trump, US stock markets have slipped back a little. But the falls are not dramatic, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 50 points or 0.24%, the Nasdaq Composite just 0.03% lower and the S&amp;P 500 off 0.06%. US markets are about to open, following Donald Trump\u2019s sacking of FBI director James Comey: Meanwhile the Greek stock market continues to be lifted by the recent agreements between the country and its creditors. It is currently up just over 1%, meaning it is on track for a twelfth consecutive rise and is at a fresh 21 month high. Indeed, it is close to erasing all the losses since the Athens exchange was closed in June and July 2015 at the height of the crisis when banks were shut and capital controls imposed. Over in Greece, it appears that the International Monetary fund will finally sign up to the economic adjustment programme keeping debt-striken Greece afloat. Helena Smith reports from Athens: As financial rows go, it was one of the longest, most ill-kept secrets of all times. But now it seems the spat between the EU and IMF over how to deal with debt-stricken Greece finally has been put to rest with the latter agreeing to participate in the country\u2019s latest bailout programme. Attending the EBRD\u2019s annual meeting in Nicosia, Slovakia\u2019s ever-loquacious finance minister Peter Kazimir said that, thanks to the Washington-based organisation\u2019s managing director Christine Lagarde, the IMF board had decided to join the programme. \u201cIt seems to me that yes, finally (the IMF will provide funding to Greece),\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to congratulate Christine Lagarde that she managed to convince the IMF. This amount is not important, (but) it is really symbolic. Technically the IMF must be on board.\u201d Germany had argued that without the IMF actively monitoring the programme, it would have trouble convincing the Bundestag to approve of further disbursement of loans. The IMF had countered that it would not sign up to the \u20ac86bn programme \u2013 the third since Greece\u2019s near-economic implosion in late 2009 \u2013 until Athens\u2019 staggering debt load was made sustainable. At 180% of GDP, the debt pile is by far the highest in the EU with the IMF saying that longer grace periods and maturity extensions are only likely to throw the problem into the long grass. But analysts now believe there are signs euro area finance ministers will revise Greece\u2019s post-programme primary surplus in its debt sustainability analysis which would pay the way to minimal debt relief in 2018 \u2013 allowing the IMF to come on board either at the next May 22 eurogroup meeting or by mid June at the latest. That, in turn, would allow emergency loans to be drawn down from the programme so that a fresh Greek crisis is avoided in July when Athens must honour debt repayments of over \u20ac7bn mostly to the ECB. In a genius touch, Dutch MPs ended Mario Draghi\u2019s session by handing him a solar-powered tulip! It\u2019s meant to remind the ECB president of the danger of asset bubbles, such as the Tulip bulb mania of the 17th century in which bulbs changed hands for huge sums of money. Deliciously, the tulip was handed over by Pieter Duisenberg MP, son of the first president of the ECB, Wim Duisenberg. Back in the Netherlands, Mario Draghi is taking a terse line with MPs who are criticising his stimulus programme, insisting that it got millions of people back to work. Draghi is also being quizzed about whether the Netherlands could leave the single currency. He says the euro is \u2018irreversible\u2019 (a stock answer). Wall Street is expected to open cautiously in an hour\u2019s time, as the Comey sacking continues to dominate the US news. Mario Draghi\u2019s breezy defence of the EBC\u2019s stimulus programme didn\u2019t convince all Dutch MPs; one has just told the ECB president that he\u2019s no hero in Holland. Draghi seems unperturbed: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is addressing the Dutch parliament now, and dismissing criticism of his actions as Europe\u2019s top central banker. He starts by explaining how the ECB took \u201cdecisive policy action\u201d when the eurozone debt crisis struck, by slashing interest rates to zero, imposing negative rates on banks, and buying tens of billions of euros of bonds each month. It worked, Draghi says, because: Since the start of 2013, inflation had drifted consistently away from the ECB\u2019s target rate of below but close to 2% over the medium term, reaching levels below 1%. Without counteracting measures, this low inflation could have turned into a deflationary spiral which would have deepened our economies\u2019 woes considerably. Instead, we now see rising growth and inflation heading towards target: But...what about Europe\u2019s savers, who have seen returns collapse? Draghi sweeps these worries aside... An accommodative monetary policy means households accrue fewer nominal returns on their savings. However, an accommodative policy supports the economic recovery, which in turn bolsters employment, income, returns on investment and tax revenues. It therefore benefits households in their capacity as workers, entrepreneurs, investors, borrowers and taxpayers. Draghi also argues that banks shouldn\u2019t grumble; OK, their profitability may suffer from low rates, but they\u2019re also spared rising delinquencies and defaults. And no Draghi speech is complete without a warning to Eurozone politicians to implement \u201cambitious, country-specific, structural reforms\u201d. Most European stock markets are in the red now, as James Comey\u2019s sacking helped to dampen the mood. Chris Beauchamp of IG say the lack of other news isn\u2019t helping: It\u2019s not every day that the US president fires the head of the FBI, so some of what we are seeing could be concerns about the political situation in the US, but overall a lack of macro catalysts and general exhaustion in equities is the main cause of the current drift in European stocks. Barclays\u2019 chairman, John McFarlane, is now backing Jes Staley, arguing that trying to uncover a whistleblower wasn\u2019t all that bad..... Here\u2019s the full quote from Barclays CEO Jes Staley about the impact of Brexit on its operations, from today\u2019s AGM meeting: While on the subject of the Investment Bank, I want to briefly touch on the question of \u2018passporting\u2019 and how the Brexit vote might affect our European operations, because I know that is of interest to shareholders. The first thing to say is that we see this as a wholly manageable challenge. Our investment banking activities in Europe are certainly important to Barclays, and to our strategy, and we are committed to remaining a strong participant in that marketplace. To be clear, we believe the development of a single market for financial services in Europe, with the full participation of banks based in the UK, remains the best option for the UK economy and the best option for the European Union economy. Nevertheless, we recognise that there are a range of possible outcomes of the negotiations in the next 23 months, and we have looked closely at our options as to what we would do in various scenarios. We are confident that we have multiple choices for how we might continue to serve our customers and clients regardless of the outcome. But I have to say that compared to the complexity of standing up our US Intermediate Holding Company, as we did on July 1st of last year, let alone establishing a ring-fenced bank in the UK from scratch, as we are currently doing, any of the options we might need to pursue are by comparison straightforward, and significantly less costly. Finally, we do not currently see a need in our options to shift British jobs or significant operations elsewhere. If we require a build-up of capability in another European Union jurisdiction as part of our plans then we can do so, and we will. Looking away from the markets briefly, Barclay\u2019s under-fire CEO has apologised to shareholders for trying to unmask a whistleblower. Jes Staley held his hands up (metaphorically) at Barclay\u2019s AGM in London this morning, saying he shouldn\u2019t have got involved. Last month, it emerged that Staley had tried to use Barclay\u2019s internal security team to find whoever had sent anonymous letters criticising a senior employer he\u2019d brought to the bank. Staley also played down the idea that Barclays might move jobs overseas because Britain is leaving the European Union. My colleague Jill Treanor is tweeting from the shareholder meeting: The FT\u2019s Edward Luce has written a snappy outline of James Comey\u2019s sacking: Like any US federal scandal, the details mount but the basics remain simple. Having fired the head of the only Russia investigation taking place within the executive branch, Mr Trump will now conduct a search for Mr Comey\u2019s replacement. What are the chances he selects an independent figure who will pick up the Russia investigation where Mr Comey left off? What are the odds Mr Trump\u2019s FBI nominee gets the necessary fifty votes for Senate confirmation? Mr Trump will be aided in his search by Jeff Sessions, the attorney-general, who was forced to recuse himself from overseeing Mr Comey\u2019s investigation because of his undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador. This was the same ambassador with whom Michael Flynn, Mr Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, held conversations secretly recorded by the FBI. The leaked contents of those, in turn, led to Mr Flynn\u2019s firing. Like any US federal scandal, the details mount but the basics remain simple. These are just the outlines. The key point is that Mr Trump has fired the man investigating him. Nixon\u2019s \u201cSaturday night massacre\u201d in which he fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor, is the only precedent. More here: Comey falls victim to Trump\u2019s Tuesday night massacre James Comey\u2019s sacking isn\u2019t entirely without precedent; Bill Clinton fired FBI director William Sessions in 1993 following a critical report into Sessions\u2019 performance and conduct. But Comey\u2019s abrupt exit may remind older readers of another incident - the notorious Saturday Night Massacre of October 1973. That was the moment Richard Nixon had special prosecutor Archibald Cox fired, rather than hand over Oval Office recordings to the inquiry into the Watergate burglary. Cox\u2019s dismissal only occurred after the attorney general and his deputy resigned rather than obey Nixon, and is a textbook example of elected politicians interfering in the judicial process (Nixon\u2019s subsequent resignation is a reminder that it doesn\u2019t always work out either....) My colleague Julian Borger has written about the comparisons with Watergate here: Jasper Lawler of London Capital Markets says memories of the Saturday Night Massacre are weighing on investors today, as they digest the news that Trump has fired the man investigating his advisor\u2019s ties with Russia. He told Sky News that: Markets don\u2019t want Donald Trump to have his own Watergate scandal. This very much reminds us of Nixon firing Cox.... Anything that can upset the reflation trade, the infrastructure spending, the tax cut that Trump is trying to get through is not good for markets Having a big political scandal would be one thing that could disrupt that. The British pound is close to hitting $1.30 for the first time since last September. Bloomberg shows how sterling is leading the charge against the US dollar today: The FT\u2019s John Gapper mischievously tweets that the US president had warned that the dollar was too strong... Naeem Aslam of Think Markets is also concerned that Comey\u2019s sacking will seriously undermine Trump\u2019s ability to get things done: For investors, this news matters, because President Trump needs to make alliance with both parties in order to have a swifter path for his tax reform bill to pass. Any unnecessary escalation of tension doesn\u2019t provide much aid to bolster investor sentiment. The last thing they want to see is the tax bill to drag on its heel forever and the nightmare of repealing the Obamacare returns. This chart shows how the dollar reacted to Comey\u2019s dismissal: Comey\u2019s shock sacking is the main topic of conversation in the City\u2019s trading rooms, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: There wasn\u2019t much for investors to work with this morning, the main news being Donald Trump going all Apprentice on FBI director James Comey. While Comey\u2019s shock dismissal doesn\u2019t technically have any immediate consequences for the market, it is another reminder of the unpredictable and irresponsible nature of Trump\u2019s governance. The news has weighed on the dollar, which fell by 0.4% against the pound \u2013 with cable continuing to tease 1.30 \u2013 and 0.2% against both the euro and the Japanese yen. The Dow futures are also down, shedding another 50 points as the index heads back towards 20900. Here\u2019s what New York traders will wake up to: James Comey\u2019s sudden dismissal last night has stunned US politicians from across both parties, with some calling for a special prosecutor to investigate links between Donald Trump\u2019s allies and Russia. This means it is a serious issue for investors too, as UBS analyst Paul Donovan explains: Ordinarily the dismissal would not matter to markets, but the move might be regarded as further evidence of presidential unpredictability (which markets dislike). It may impact relations with Congress, and relations with Russia; both have market relevance. Without Congress\u2019s support, Trump will struggle to deliver his promised infrastructure spending boost, or push through his controversial tax reforms. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the US president has \u201cthrown another spanner into the works\u201d. This could impact approval of the stimulus policy markets are hankering after. Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo, says Asian traders were unnerved by the news: \u201cThe Comey news is being treated as a risk-off event, and the headlines were sparking the dollar\u2019s move down.\u201d The US dollar is coming under pressure this morning after Donald Trump shocked America, and beyond, by firing the director of the FBI. The sudden dismissal of James Comey has given the markets a jolt, with some analysts citing it as an example of Trump\u2019s erratic approach. The dollar is down against the pound, sending sterling up to $1.298. The selloff has also sent the euro back towards $1.09. Emerging market currencies, such as the South African rand, are also benefitting. Trump told Comey yesterday that he was fired over his handling over Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, and that the FBI needed new leadership. But as we reported last night, the move has also intensified the focus on Russia\u2019s activities around the US election: The move came as CNN reported that a grand jury had begun issuing subpoenas to associates of Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser at the centre of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year\u2019s presidential election. If confirmed, the report suggests that the FBI\u2019s investigation into the Trump camp\u2019s links with Moscow has entered a significant new phase. Comey\u2019s sacking, which was condemned by one Senate Democrat as \u201cNixonian\u201d, raised concerns over the independence of the investigation and prompted vociferous demands for a special prosecutor to be appointed. RBC Capital Market believes the move will weigh on Wall Street when trading begins later today. Donald Trump \u201cterminated\u201d FBI Director James Comey, calling for a \u201cnew beginning\u201d. US stock futures slipped as a result. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are hovering around record highs today, as traders continue to take comfort from the French election result But what will Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory mean for Europe\u2019s economy? We\u2019ll find out what Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, thinks when he testifies to the Dutch parliament around noon today. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities believes Draghi could push the euro higher. In the past Mario Draghi has been overly optimistic about the growth prospects of the Euro area but today improvements in the data may support his view. From Sunday the European currency has dropped from its 1.1000 heights to trade as low as 1.0870, so his speech may be a trigger for some of these losses to be recovered. Investors are also wondering whether the market rally can keep going. Last night, tech giant Apple became the first company to ever be worth $800bn - putting it on track for a $1 trillion market cap before the year is out. And earlier today, the Hong Kong Hang Seng index broke through the 25,000-point mark on Wednesday for the first time in nearly two years. European markets are expected to be calm this morning: Market volatility has fallen to its lowest levels since 1993, a sign of optimism \u2013 and possibly complacency \u2013 seeping across the trading floors. Last night\u2019s shock sacking of FBI director James Comey has served as as reminder that shocks are always around the corner... We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

In Europe shares moved higher, and there was a similar story in the UK, while the decline in the US was fairly muted. An initial drop in the dollar did not last, and the pound\u2019s move higher towards $1.30 was soon nipped in the bud as dealers looked forward to the Bank of England meeting on Thursday, expected to be fairly dovish.

The pound, for example, having looked as if it was going to breach the $1.3 level for the first time since September, is now down 0.02% at $1.2931. Investors are of course keeping Thursday\u2019s Bank of England meeting in mind, with the expectation that rates will remain unchanged and fading talk of a hawkish outlook.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Europe, markets are moving higher, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.17% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 0.06%. The FTSe 100 is currently up 0.67%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Comey controversy continued to be the main topic of discussion this Wednesday, though its impact on the market faded as the afternoon went on.</p> <p>The Dow Jones kicked off the US session 50 points lower, an improvement on the 80 point drop promised by the futures at points during the morning. The dollar also recovered the majority of its losses... That means Trump\u2019s dismissal of the FBI director has transitioned from pressing concern to mild annoyance in the eyes of investors, if not for the health of American democracy.</p> <p>The shrinking of sterling\u2019s growth was a boost to the FTSE, which surged 40 points higher this Wednesday, nearing 7400 for the first time in a month. The thrust of the index\u2019s momentum stems from the commodity sector; with Brent Crude tickling $49.50 per barrel BP and Shell both leapt 1% higher, while the mining stocks ignored copper\u2019s stagnation to instead focus on gold\u2019s gains.

Attending the EBRD\u2019s annual meeting in Nicosia, Slovakia\u2019s ever-loquacious finance minister Peter Kazimir said that, thanks to the Washington-based organisation\u2019s managing director Christine Lagarde, the IMF board had decided to join the programme.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me that yes, finally (the IMF will provide funding to Greece),\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to congratulate Christine Lagarde that she managed to convince the IMF.

      "bodyText": "The owner of Pret a Manger is reportedly exploring a listing on the New York stock exchange, as it eyes up expansion in the $41bn (\u00a332bn) a year US coffee shop market. Bridgepoint, the UK-based private equity firm, is thought to be considering a flotation with JP Morgan and Jefferies as lead advisers. Barclays, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Piper Jaffray are also advising on the plans. Pret is headquartered in London where it was founded in 1986, and 329 of its 444 outlets are in the UK. Pret opened 50 shops last year, including 31 in the UK and nine in the US, taking its total to 74 in its second biggest market. The company has revealed attempts to woo more British workers as it prepares for potential staff shortages after Brexit and seeks to expand in the US and internationally. Listing in New York rather than London would allow Pret to raise its profile in one of its key growth markets. The US coffee shop market, where leading brands include Starbucks and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, was worth $41bn last year, according to a survey by the Allegra World Coffee Portal, and is forecast to reach $85bn by 2025. By contrast, UK coffee shop sales were \u00a33.1bn in 2016 and are forecast to hit \u00a33.7bn by 2020, according to Mintel. Bridgepoint bought Pret in 2008 and is expected to retain a stake if the initial public offering goes ahead. Pret was founded by the entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe and his friend Sinclair Beecham, who retain a small stake. Metcalfe went on to create the Itsu restaurant chain and Metcalfe\u2019s Skinny popcorn. \u201cAs a committed shareholder in Pret we are always exploring appropriate opportunities to ensure the future growth of the company,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said. \u201cIf such opportunities materialise, we will update the market.\u201d Its chief executive, Clive Schlee, described New York as a \u201cwonderful Pret market\u201d, adding the company could easily have as many stores there as it has in London. In the UK, about 65% of its workforce is drawn from EU countries other than Britain. The company has traditionally relied on its website to fill vacancies, with applicants directed to a recruitment centre in London, but it has started advertising roles in job centres and on social media to try to attract British workers. Last month Andrea Wareham, Pret\u2019s director of human resources, told MPs the chain would struggle to hire workers in sufficient numbers if it could no longer easily recruit from within the EU after Brexit. It came under fire this year when the Guardian revealed it was offering 500 British teenagers a week of unpaid work experience. The 16- to 18-year-olds were only being offered free food. However, the company relented after a backlash on social media and Schlee said the company would pay them all Pret\u2019s hourly starting rate. Pret prides itself on the freshness of its food and its ability to spot the latest trends, such as avocado, quinoa and chakalaka beans. The group posted a record set of results in 2016, with global sales rising 15% to \u00a3776m and like-for-like sales up 4.8%.It also has 19 shops in France, 19 in Hong Kong, two in China and one in Dubai.",

Metcalfe went on to create the Itsu restaurant chain and Metcalfe\u2019s Skinny popcorn.</p> <p>\u201cAs a committed shareholder in Pret we are always exploring appropriate opportunities to ensure the future growth of the company,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said. \u201cIf such opportunities materialise, we will update the market.\u201d</p> <p>Its chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/new-yorkers-queuing-up-pret-a-manger\">Clive Schlee, described New York as a \u201cwonderful Pret market\u201d</a>, adding the company could easily have as many stores there as it has in London.</p> <p>In the UK, about 65% of its workforce is drawn from EU countries other than Britain. The company has traditionally relied on its website to fill vacancies, with applicants directed to a recruitment centre in London, but it has started advertising roles in job centres and on social media to try to attract British workers.</p> <p>Last month Andrea Wareham, Pret\u2019s director of human resources, told MPs the chain would struggle to hire workers in sufficient numbers if it could no longer easily recruit from within the EU after Brexit.</p> <p>It came under fire this year when the Guardian revealed it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/25/pret-a-manger-looks-to-uks-teenagers-to-tackle-looming-staff-crisis\">offering 500 British teenagers a week of unpaid work experience</a>. The 16- to 18-year-olds were only being offered free food. However, the company relented after a backlash on social media and Schlee said the company would pay them all Pret\u2019s hourly starting rate.</p> <p>Pret prides itself on the freshness of its food and its ability to spot the latest trends, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/may/10/avocado-hand-why-the-fruit-has-become-a-health-hazard\">avocado</a>, quinoa and chakalaka beans.</p> <p>The group posted a record set of results in 2016, with global sales rising 15% to \u00a3776m and like-for-like sales up 4.8%.It also has 19 shops in France, 19 in Hong Kong, two in China and one in Dubai.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Whitbread, Alison Brittain, has said it is important for businesses to set diversity targets, as she scooped the Veuve Clicquot businesswoman of the year award. \u201cI\u2019m not a great fan of quotas but I am a great fan of targets and there\u2019s a subtle difference,\u201d said Brittain, who is one of just seven female FTSE 100 chief executives. \u201cFor everything we do running a business we set goals and targets ... if you don\u2019t measure it there\u2019s a sense that it\u2019s not important. Setting a target [to improve diversity] is sending a really important signal that the issue is being taken seriously.\u201d The accolade means Brittain, who has been running the Costa and Premier Inn owner since September 2015, joins a select group of winners that includes the late Dame Anita Roddick, the founder of The Body Shop, and Dame Marjorie Scardino, who as boss of the publishing group Pearson became the first female FTSE 100 chief executive. The judges said Brittain was a role model for women striving to reach the top of big organisations and had succeeded in what were traditionally male-dominated sectors. They also pointed to her championing of the need for more women in executive-level positions and commitment to Whitbread initiatives designed to improve skills and career development at the company. Brittain had demonstrated \u201cstrong leadership\u201d and shown the \u201csame courage, enterprising determination and commitment to social responsibility\u201d as Madame Clicquot herself, said Mo\u00ebt Hennessy UK\u2019s Julie Nollet. Brought up in Derbyshire, Brittain has a degree in business studies from Stirling University and an MBA from Cambridge University\u2019s Judge institute. She started her career as a graduate trainee at Barclays and over the next two decades worked her way up to become head of retail banking at Lloyds, where she was labelled the most powerful woman in British banking. Brittain, 52, said she was honoured to win the award but also daunted to be ranked alongside the previous winners. She joked that her celebrations would involve drinking \u201ccopious amounts of champagne\u201d. After climbing to the top of the male-dominated banking industry, Brittain switched sectors to lead Whitbread, which also owns the Beefeater Grill and Brewers Fayre restaurant brands, and employs about 50,000 people. It banked underlying pre-tax profits of \u00a3562.2m on sales of \u00a33.1bn in the year to 2 March. The ranks of FTSE 100 female bosses were bolstered by last year\u2019s appointment of Emma Walmsey as the chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, Britain\u2019s biggest drugs company. Alongside Brittain at Whitbread, the others are Kingfisher\u2019s V\u00e9ronique Laury, Severn Trent\u2019s Liv Garfield, Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco, EasyJet\u2019s Carolyn McCall \u2013 a former businesswoman of the year winner \u2013 and Moya Greene of Royal Mail. But while women\u2019s presence in the boardroom has grown over the past four years, according to research by the Directory of Social Change, their positions tend to be non-executive and it is still rare for companies to have a female chair or chief executive. Its analysis of company corporate social responsibility policies and annual reports put the overall percentage of women on boards at about 22%. In March the government wrote to the chief executives of all FTSE 350 companies urging them to improve diversity and echoing a call to publish a breakdown of their workforce by race and pay. The business minister, Margot James, said companies should take up key recommendations from a recent government-backed review into race in the workplace by the businesswoman Ruby McGregor-Smith.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Barclays has said he sees no reason to shift British jobs to Europe as a result of Brexit and described the restructuring required as straightforward compared with other challenges faced by the bank. Jes Staley said Brexit would be \u201ca wholly manageable challenge\u201d and \u201csignificantly less costly\u201d than other problems the bank had encountered. Preparing for Brexit, Staley said, was not as complex as setting up a US holding company, as required by the US authorities last year, or preparing to ring-fence Barclays\u2019 high street bank from its risky investment banking arm by 2019. His remarks contrast with those of rivals such as Deutsche Bank which has warned 4,000 roles could go from London, while US bank JP Morgan is preparing to move up to 1,000 bankers out of the City to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg. Goldman Sachs, despite continuing to build a new headquarters in London, has said it will need more people in Madrid, Milan, Paris and other cities in the EU. Speaking at Barclays\u2019 annual shareholder meeting in London, Staley said retaining the single market for financial services that currently exists within the EU remained the best option for the UK and EU economy. He said the bank was prepared for any outcome, and that the bank had \u201cmultiple choices\u201d on how it would continue to serve its customers and clients, regardless of the final deal. He added: \u201cI have to say that compared to the complexity of standing up our US intermediate holding company, as we did on 1 July last year, let alone establishing a ringfenced bank in the UK from scratch, as we are currently doing, any of the options we might need to pursue are by comparison straightforward, and significantly less costly.\u201d Staley continued: \u201cFinally, we do not currently see a need in our options to shift British jobs or significant operations elsewhere. If we require a buildup of capability in another European Union jurisdiction as part of our plans then we can do so, and we will.\u201d Barclays has previously suggested its Dublin office could become more important after Brexit and it is thought that the bank will hire more staff in Ireland. At the meeting shareholders raised questions about an investigation into Staley\u2019s attempts to unmask a whistleblower and one investor called on the American banker to resign. Another asked what he had intended to do if had been successful in his attempts to uncover the identity of the individual who made allegations about the previous conduct of Tim Main, who worked with Staley at JP Morgan and who Staley recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June. Staley made two attempts to discover the identity of the individual making the allegations and began the meeting by apologising to shareholders for his actions, which he now says were a mistake. Both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority are investigating the matter. Barclays has formally reprimanded Staley and insisted that there will be a significant reduction in his bonus, which was \u00a31.4m last year. John McFarlane, the Barclays chairman, repeatedly defended the chief executive who he hired in 2015 after forcing out previous chief executive Antony Jenkins. McFarlane said Staley did not need to go. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that was the just action for what actually happened,\u201d the chairman said. On the second occasion that Staley tried to discover the whistleblower\u2019s identity, McFarlane said \u201che thought he had a green light. He went through the light and it actually it was red. \u201cThe action for going through red light wrongly is you don\u2019t lose your licence.\u201d McFarlane told the shareholder concerned about Staley\u2019s intentions if he had found the whistleblower: \u201cAll he wanted to do and stop them sending the letters.\u201d Shareholders have being advised to abstain from the annual vote to re-elect Staley to the board by ISS, an influential adviser to major investors.",

      "bodyText": "Whichever party wins on 8 June, Dermot Nolan will become one of the most powerful regulators in Britain. As head of the energy regulator Ofgem, the 51-year-old will control the price that millions of people pay for their electricity and gas after the general election. A Conservative victory would see Nolan tasked with setting a cap on how high default energy tariffs can go, in relation to the wholesale prices that suppliers have to pay. A surprise Labour win would require him to go further, imposing limits not just on those standard variable tariffs, but cheaper fixed deals as well. The fact that rising energy bills have climbed so far up the political agenda means the civil servant\u2019s decisions will be scrutinised much more closely than when he joined Ofgem in 2014. Back then, the incoming chief executive was accused of flip-flopping at his debut in front of MPs, when he criticised energy companies\u2019 profit margins for being too high, before later apologising and saying firms did need to earn a profit. Fast forward to February this year and Nolan was far more polished and implacable under a grilling from MPs, when he criticised the industry for what he saw as unjustified price rises over the winter and said he could impose a price cap if he was ordered to do so by politicians. Nolan\u2019s big move so far has been to refer the energy market to the competition watchdog in 2014 to \u201cclear the air\u201d over accusations the big six suppliers \u2013 British Gas, E.ON, EDF, Npower, SSE and Scottish Power \u2013 had been profiteering at consumers\u2019 expense. But Theresa May decided that the results of that Competitions and Market Authority review \u2013 which favoured measures to increase switching, rather than a price cap \u2013 did not go far enough. Energy prices are just the most high profile of several challenges facing Nolan. His in-tray has included how power grids cope with the transition to cleaner but more variable power such as wind and solar, and stopping diesel generators scooping up too many financial benefits for providing backup power. Nolan is well-liked by those who have worked with him, with one energy industry source describing him as having a \u201cconsensual\u201d approach to tackling issues. \u201cThere\u2019s a good amount of access, and open and honest conversation,\u201d the source said. A second senior industry figure called him a \u201cdecent man\u201d who is keen to listen and engage but said there was a \u201cquestion mark over whether Ofgem under Nolan\u2019s stewardship has the teeth to do what is right for the consumer if it flies in the face of what No 10 wants\u201d. Another said he was very committed, and not just because of salary of up to \u00a3195,000 he received in 2015/16. \u201cHe\u2019s passionate about energy. I know that might sound nerdy but it\u2019s an important industry: it\u2019s an essential service, it\u2019s not like regulating widgets,\u201d the source said. The chief executive\u2019s CV should see him well-equipped to deal with the challenges ahead. Before he crossed the Irish Sea to head Ofgem, Nolan worked for the independent Irish energy regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation. Ironically, as chair there between 2011 and 2014, he oversaw the deregulation of the domestic energy market, ending the regulation of prices for householders. Earlier roles saw Nolan work as chief economist at the Irish communications regulator and manager of the mergers division at the country\u2019s competition watchdog. Born in Ireland, he studied economics at Trinity College Dublin, and after graduating gained a PhD in economics at Yale, before lecturing at the University of London on market structures. A 22-year-old Nolan also penned an undergraduate essay that foresaw the problems he would face decades later. \u201cI think that market failure is a major problem that cannot just be ignored, and thus for economics to be a useful discipline it will always need to be able to explain, and hopefully correct, market failure,\u201d he wrote in a paper on Keynesian economics. Will he be able to correct an energy market that May has derided as broken? Nolan is seen as having been more successful than Alistair Buchanan, his predecessor, partly because of the action he took with the CMA review. He has also been the beneficiary of luckier timing. Wholesale prices slumped between 2014 and 2016, taking some of the political heat out of the public\u2019s concerns over energy bills, before they began to creep up last winter. In January, Nolan reinstated an index to make the costs facing suppliers more transparent. While admitting their wholesale costs had edged up, he warned energy companies off hiking prices, saying: \u201cAt this point in time it is not obvious to us that there should be price rises.\u201d His advice went unheeded. Five of the big six suppliers and dozens of smaller ones all cranked up their tariffs in the following months. But come June, whoever wins the election, Nolan should be bestowed with the power to disprove the old jibe that Ofgem is a \u201ctoothless tiger\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "UK will face pay squeeze this year as inflation spikes, warns thinktank", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British workers will see their disposable incomes shrinking this year as a result of rising inflation that will peak at 3.4%, a leading economic thinktank has warned. The National Institute of Economic &amp; Social Research said that wage rises would be capped at only 2.7% on average, leaving workers to face the largest real-terms cut in their takehome pay since early 2014. The warning follows the controversy over rising energy bills and inflation-busting increases in council tax that have already hit household budgets ahead of the general election. Recent surveys have shown consumers devoting a bigger slice of their weekly shopping budget to essential items in response to increasing prices by a wide range of retailers. Theresa May has pledged to cap energy costs to boost disposable incomes, while Jeremy Corbyn wants to intervene in the housing market to reduce the escalating cost of buying a home and monthly rental costs. The prediction for a spike in inflation of 3.4% is well above the level forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, which said earlier this year inflation would reach 2.4% by the end of 2017. Inflation has already begun to rise steeply. It jumped markedly in February to 2.3% to overtake regular wage rises, which only inched ahead by 1.9% month on month. NIESR said wage growth was likely to pick up over the rest of the year, but remain well below inflation, denying the average worker a real terms rise. Simon Kirby, NIESR\u2019s UK economic forecaster, said that with inflation already hitting 2.3%, the OBR would be forced to revise its forecast upwards. He said: \u201cGDP growth over the next couple of years will be subdued, growing at less than the economy\u2019s long-run potential rate of 2% per annum, but households will feel the pinch from rising consumer price inflation.\u201d He added: \u201cThe rate of inflation is expected to rise from 2.3% per annum in March to almost 3.5% by the end of 2017. By 2018 we expect consumer spending growth to have effectively stalled.\u201d Kirby said a previous forecast that predicted inflation would hit 3.7% had been revised lower in response to reports showing that the impact of the falling pound would be spread over a longer period. NIESR said that despite the squeeze on disposable incomes the GDP growth rate would pick up from 1.7% this year to 1.9% in 2018. It said moves towards Brexit since the vote to quit the EU last June had made little impact on its forecasts. It said the triggering of article 50 had only a short term impact on financial markets, leaving the economy to move ahead, albeit at a slower pace than before the vote. Kirby said the labour market remained \u201crobust\u201d with an unemployment rate of 4.7% and an employment rate hitting a record high in the three months to February of 74.6%. But he said surveys continued to show that millions of workers want an increase in the number of hours they work, showing that firms could increase output without taking on new staff or increasing hourly rates. \u201cDespite the strong performance of the labour market, real wages growth remains subdued, perhaps indicating some slack remains,\u201d he said. Bank of England officials are expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25% when they meet on Thursday to offer continued support to the economy and the jobs market. Economists forecast that just one policymaker, Kristin Forbes, will vote for a rate rise to quell inflation, while the other seven members will consider the increase in prices to be temporary. Kirby said he expected the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee to keep rates on hold until after the UK has quit the EU in 2019 when it will start to rise towards 2% in the latter half of 2022. A report by NIESR on the global economy said increasing activity in the developing countries would push GDP growth higher following a four year low point in 2016. Risks to the forecast came from the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal and US president Donald Trump introducing protectionist policies, but without these threats, the outlook was for an improving global growth rate.",

The bank is expected to update investors as soon as this week about its attempts to find a buyer, amid speculation that it is struggling to attract an offer and that bondholders will be forced to step in. Even if a bidder is found, bondholders still face losses as part of the Co-op bank\u2019s requirement to meet the Bank of England\u2019s requests for more capital. The Co-op Bank has warned bondholders that potential bidders have sought \u201csome form of liability management exercise\u201d \u2013 which could see investors take losses in return for equity stakes. The LME could boost the bank\u2019s capital by \u00a3450m, which would leave another \u00a3300m to be raised in fresh funds. This would require Co-op Bank to convince existing investors to stump up more cash or seek more backers. Among those flagged as potential new investors are Virgin Money, TSB and buyout houses JC Flowers and Cerberus. The Bank of England is reported to have Co-op under \u201cintensive supervision\u201d. The Manchester-based bank has endured five consecutive years of losses since its problems started to emerge in 2013, which have sapped its ability to rebuild its capital. But the Co-op Bank\u2019s management hopes to attract a buyer because of its 4 million customers who are attracted by its ethical approach to doing business. Co-op Bank, which refused to comment on Tuesday, insisted last month that it had \u201creceived a number of non-binding proposals from strategic and financial parties\u201d and \u201cselected several parties to enter a further phase\u201d of talks. The bank put itself up for sale in February, four years after its near-collapse which sparked its rescue by hedge funds. The hedge funds have been left owning 80% of the bank, which until then had been 100% owned by the Co-operative Group of supermarkets and funeral homes. But the mutual is unlikely to be ready to put more cash into the bank after writing down the value of its 20% stake to nil last month. At the time, the Co-op Group finance director, Ian Ellis expressed hope that the bank\u2019s sale would be successful and that the group expected \u201cto get some value from the sale\u201d. However, the Co-op Group may also demand a solution to pension scheme it shares with the bank, which is due for revaluation in July, and could be a potential barrier to any buyer. An institution that once had bold ambitions to merge with TSB, the Co-op Bank has been dramatically scaled back over the past years, from nearly 300 branches to just 95.",
