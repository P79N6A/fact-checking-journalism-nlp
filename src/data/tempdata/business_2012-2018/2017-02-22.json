The chief executive, Paul Polman, after his unpleasant encounter with Kraft Heinz, appears to have drawn two correct conclusions. First, it was embarrassing that a company of Unilever\u2019s size and standing could even be viewed as prey by Kraft\u2019s cast of job-slashing billionaires. Second, the best way to improve matters is for Unilever to get its share price higher. Wednesday\u2019s statement \u2013 \u201cThe events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever\u201d \u2013 was woolly but significant. Unilever is conceding, in effect, that it cannot take its shareholders\u2019 loyalty for granted. Polman was probably told as much by a few powerful fund managers who do not share his love of long-term perspectives. But what does \u201caccelerating delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders\u201d mean? In Kraft Heinz\u2019s mouth, translation would be easier. It could imply thousands of job losses, cuts in investment and less time spent fretting about sustainable models of capitalism. Polman, one suspects, will do none of those things. He could hardly do so with credibility given his many admirable statements about reducing Unilever\u2019s environmental footprint and being a force for social good. But there are actions Unilever could take without trampling on its heritage. Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood set out five this week: sell the perennially underperforming Flora spreads business; demand higher profit margins; be tighter on capital expenditure; use the strong balance sheet to buy more small businesses or to return cash to shareholders; communicate with investors better. None of those sound too painful. The last merely exhorts Polman to stop the pretence that he does not give guidance when he does, just in unnecessarily vague terms. Indeed, the company has already discovered that its profit margins in 2017 will be at the top end of the intended range when the lower end was expected only a month ago. A proper long-range target for margins \u2013 18.5% by 2020, suggests Wood, versus 15.3% last year \u2013 could be a useful discipline. Such a self-help plan sounds more credible than wacky notions like bidding for Colgate or splitting Unilever into two pieces, food and personal care. On day one, the fightback went well and the share price rose 6%. Jolly good. Now let\u2019s see the Kraft shock translate into action. Long-term horizons are terrific \u2013 but, if you\u2019re a public company, you have to be able to protect your independence. Lloyds shrugs off Brexit vote In the days after the UK voted to leave the EU, Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s shares fell from 70p to 48p. The theory was simple: Lloyds, as the UK\u2019s biggest lender, is a proxy for the state of the UK economy, and the outlook was about to turn bleak. Now the shares, up 4% on Wednesday, have regained all the ground lost. It is too soon to sound the all-clear, of course, and the Lloyds chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, in his overview of 2016, felt obliged to include the standard warnings about the \u201cunclear\u201d nature of the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU and the \u201cuncertain\u201d economic outlook. All the same, it is hard to discern any impact on Lloyds\u2019 business from the Brexit vote. There are few signs of strain on the default front. Impaired loans have not soared, as the City feared, and are only 1.8% of the book, versus 2.1% at the end of 2015. Nor did Lloyds feel a need to alter well-signalled plans to pay bigger dividends. Not every lender will look so solid and, yes, the dial can turn again when the moment of Brexit approaches. But, in retrospect, the panic over banks was wildly overdone. Takeover rules will need critical definition In encouraging news, Greg Clark, the business secretary, says he will set out proposals on the government\u2019s stance towards foreign takeovers of British firms, or at least as it will apply to \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d. Task one: define what you mean by critical. Nuclear power and car manufacturers will clearly be inside the tent. But where do you stand on pharmaceutical firms, or even Unilever? Spell it out, and then describe how intervention will be enforced.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government will offer extra help for small firms affected by an imminent change to business rates, the communities secretary has announced, saying that more should be done \u201cto level the playing field\u201d. Following increasing concern from some businesses and Conservative MPs about the impact of the first business rate revaluation in seven years, Sajid Javid said the chancellor, Philip Hammond, would announce new measures in the budget on 8 March. This would form part of a wider and longer-term re-examination of the business rates system, he added. The announcement follows a pledge from Theresa May at prime minister\u2019s questions that small businesses left with the highest rate increases would be helped. Javid\u2019s department said it would be revealed at the budget whether the current \u00a33.6bn fund for transitional relief would be increased. Speaking during a wider Commons debate on local government finance, Javid said the rates revaluation would see three-quarters of all businesses pay the same amount or less than before. \u201cI am also acutely aware of the impact on the quarter that will see increases,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf your rates are going up, it\u2019s no consolation to hear that others\u2019 will be going down. I\u2019ve long recognised the need to provide support.\u201d The transitional relief fund would help more than 140,000 smaller businesses, Javid said, adding: \u201cBut as colleagues and the media have highlighted in recent days, there are clearly some individual businesses facing particular difficulties.\u201d Javid said a particular problem was faced by smaller shops in areas that have seen high increases in rent \u2013 the rates are based on rentable values \u2013 and by firms facing \u201can alarming cliff edge\u201d after losing their entitlement to rate relief. \u201cI have always listened to businesses, and this situation is no exception,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that more needs to be done to level the playing field and to make the system fairer. \u201cI\u2019m working closely with my right honourable friend the chancellor to determine how best to provide further support for businesses facing the biggest increases. We expect to be in a position to make an announcement at the time of the budget in just two weeks\u2019 time.\u201d Asked whether there was scope for a more fundamental review, Javid said there was \u201cclearly some room for improvement\u201d, for example in helping smaller shops thrive in a world of online retail. \u201cNobody would argue that the current system is perfect, and it is right to ask whether the time has come for some kind of reform,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking closely at all possible steps for making it fairer and more sustainable in both the short term and the long term.\u201d The announcement follows a letter sent to Hammond by Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chair of the Treasury committee, seeking clarification on some parts of the revaluation, particularly whether out-of-town businesses were benefiting at the expense of smaller, urban firms. The letter asks Hammond to give figures on the proportion of small, medium and large businesses facing rises or falls in business rates. The delay since rates were last reassessed \u201cwas bound to store up trouble\u201d, Tyrie said. \u201cFor businesses whose properties have increased disproportionately in value over the last seven years, the increases may be painful.\u201d At prime minister\u2019s questions, May said she had asked Hammond and Javid to make sure relief was targeted at those businesses most in need. The overhaul of the business rates system will see the biggest rises in places such as London and other areas in the south-east, where rents have risen sharply in recent years. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, asked May whether she would review the rates upheaval, pointing out that some small businesses in her constituency would face increases of up to 400%. May defended the overall aim of the process, adding: \u201cI recognise that there has been particular concern that there will be some small businesses that are particularly adversely affected by the result of this revaluation \u2026 That\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked the chancellor and communities secretary to make sure there is appropriate relief in those hardest cases.\u201d May\u2019s spokesman clarified that she had not been promising any extra money. In talking to Hammond and Javid, the prime minister was seeking \u201cto make sure that once we go forward during this process that this transitional fund goes to the areas where it is most in need,\u201d he said. Asked later about a comment from Lucas that government policy on business rates was in confusion, the spokesman said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is chaos. We have set out our plans to provide a fund, a transitional relief fund, to make sure that those who are affected by the rise in business rates have a smoother transition to the new system.\u201d When it emerged that Javid had announced the policy as the spokesman was briefing journalists, he said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that he was going to make an announcement. I don\u2019t know what he has said.\u201d",

The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 27.42 points or 0.38% at 7302.25 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.26% to 11,998.59 having earlier breached the 12,000 barrier for the first time since April 2015 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.15% to 4895.88 italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.83% to 18,884.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex slipped 0.88% to 9477.2 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered from its early falls and has hit a new peak of 20,766, up 23 points. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Unilever shares have ended as the day\u2019s biggest riser in the FTSE 100, following news of their plans to boost shareholder value in the wake of the rejected bid from Kraft Heinz. The shares ended up 5.7% at \u00a337/91, just shy of the record close of \u00a337.97 on Friday when the Kraft bid emerged. Inflationary pressures are building in the economy, and here are more signs of that. Ada, Vaughan reports: Britain\u2019s big six energy suppliers are under pressure to pass on more price hikes to consumers\u2019 energy bills, the industry trade body has warned. Npower, EDF and Scottish Power have already announced price rises for millions of customers, blaming a mix of rising wholesale costs, installation of smart meters and government policies paid for through bills. British Gas has frozen prices until August, while SSE and E.ON have yet to declare their intentions. The chief executive of Energy UK, which represents most of the 40-plus energy suppliers, told MPs on Wednesday that the rises were justified. \u201cIt is plain that we have seen increases in wholesale prices over the last 12 months or so, and we can see going out into the future there are continuing pressures there,\u201d said Lawrence Slade. He said month-ahead wholesale gas prices for March were 100% higher than last year, and electricity was up 69%. The full story is here: Meawhile British Gas owner Centrica is due to report results on Thursday, and here\u2019s a quick preview: Back with Unilever, and the company\u2019s shares are now up 5.5%, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100. The rise follows its announcement it is acting to boost shareholder value following the rejected bid from Kraft Heinz. Rob Davies writes: Unilever has upgraded profit margin expectations and announced a \u201ccomprehensive review of options\u201d to improve value for shareholders in an apparent effort to shore itself up against a renewed bid from the US food group Kraft Heinz. The Anglo-Dutch company knocked back a \u00a3115bn bid from Kraft on Friday, and 48 hours later its US rival withdrew its bid, with both sides saying talks had ended \u201camicably\u201d. Kraft is now blocked from renewing its interest for six months under the UK\u2019s takeover code, while Unilever has expressed confidence in the support it has from long-term investors. But management, led by the chief executive, Paul Polman, is thought to have been surprised that Unilever could be seen as an acquisition target and released two statements outlining plans to ensure shareholders wouldn\u2019t be tempted by further takeover bids. In a statement to the stock market, the company said it was \u201cconducting a comprehensive review of options available to accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders\u201d. \u201cThe events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever. We expect the review to be completed by early April, after which we will communicate further.\u201d The announcement is likely to revive suggestions that Unilever could look to sell its struggling standalone spreads business. The company could also examine ways to boost the company\u2019s share price by stepping up efforts to squeeze costs, a strategy that would make a renewed tilt by Kraft Heinz more expensive if successful. The full story is here: Some strong housing figures from the US will increase expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before too long. Existing home sales climbed by 3.3% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.69m units, a ten year high and well above the 5.54m expected by economists. The December figure was revised up from 5.49m to 5.51m. Demand for housing is being supported by a strong employment market, with buyers undeterred by higher prices and mortgage rates. Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors which released the figures, said: Much of the country saw robust sales activity last month as strong hiring and improved consumer confidence at the end of last year appear to have sparked considerable interest in buying a home. Market challenges remain, but the housing market is off to a prosperous start as homebuyers staved off inventory levels that are far from adequate and deteriorating affordability conditions. After consistently hitting new peaks in recent days, US markets have slipped back as investors pause for breath. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 44 points or 0.21% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened slightly lower. A dip in oil prices sent energy stocks lower, while there was some profit taking ahead of the latest Federal Reserve minutes. Alasdair Pal of Reuters is tweeting about the Unilever news: A second announcement from Unilever just hit the City -- saying it is on track to hit the higher end of its profitability guidance The company say: The management of Unilever now expects Core Operating Margin improvement for 2017 to be at the upper end of its 40-80 basis points guidance. Unilever\u2019s shares have jumped by 3%, following its pledge to unlock more value.... Hello.... consumer good firm Unilever has just issued an intriguing statement to the City. It says: Unilever is conducting a comprehensive review of options available to accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders. The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever. We expect the review to be completed by early April, after which we will communicate further. What does this mean? Almost certainly, the Anglo-Dutch giant is planning to cut costs, and possibly selloff non-core divisions (maybe the spreads arm?), before Kraft Heinz can come back with a better takeover offer in six month\u2019s time. Even though Unilever managed to defy Kraft Heinz\u2019s first takeover approach last week, the company\u2019s management must be disconcerted by the whole affair. And although Unilever\u2019s major shareholders remained loyal to CEO Paul Polman, some must be wondering if their investment should be sweated a little... Newsflash: Britain\u2019s government is drawing up proposals for how it could intervene when a foreign company tries to buy a UK firm. It\u2019s a timely move, with Unilever having just told Kraft Heinz where it can stick its \u00a3114bn takeover offer. Business secretary Greg Clark made the pledge during a speech at the EEF\u2019s annual conference in London today, telling delegates that: \u201cWe will be setting out some proposals in the weeks ahead.\u201d Clark was also quizzed on Brexit, but didn\u2019t shed much new light on the government\u2019s strategy: Business investment in the UK fell by 1.5% during 2016, a decline of \u00a32.7bn, according to new ONS figures. That\u2019s the first annual decrease in business investment since 2009, after the financial crisis. The ONS says firms cut their investment in buildings, machinery, and information and communication technology. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady fears the knock-on impact on productivity, employment and wages. \u201cIt\u2019s very worrying to see that business investment is already falling with the challenges of Brexit ahead. If this trend continues, working people will pay the price through weaker wages and fewer jobs. \u201cDespite a modest boost to public investment last year, UK investment still lags behind the world\u2019s leading industrial nations. With private sector investment in retreat, the Chancellor must focus on closing the gap with our competitors in next month\u2019s budget. This would help protect jobs and wages, and it would give a much needed boost to business confidence.\u201d This chart shows how business investment has been lacklustre recently. The momentum in the UK economy at the turn of the year continues to surprise to the upside, says Sam Hill of Royal Bank of Canada. But he expects growth to slow in the current quarter, to around +0.4%, because: ...higher inflation and Brexit uncertainty present on-going headwinds to consumer spending and business investment, which the erratic contribution from the external sector is unlikely to compensate for. Ben Chu of the Independent has created a handy graph, showing how business investment has tailed off: The weak pound helped to cushion Britain from the Brexit vote shock, says Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset management. \u201cThe improved GDP revision for the final quarter of 2016 confirms that it was business as usual for the UK economy, despite the UK\u2019s momentous vote to leave the EU. The lower pound appears to have acted as shock absorber and continues to aid industrial activity and exports. The UK is also in a fortunate position of capitalising on any pick up in global growth given that 70% of its market is international. Britain\u2019s economic growth was less impressive when you adjust for population changes. GDP rose by 0.5% on a per-head basis in the last quarter, and is now 1.8% above its pre-crisis peak in 2008. Overall, Britain\u2019s economy is 8.6% larger than before the financial crisis struck - making it one of the better-performing G7 economies. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, has a good take on today\u2019s GDP report: \u201cToday\u2019s revised GDP data were a mixed bag of good and bad news, but this doesn\u2019t change the big picture that the UK continued to grow steadily during the six months following the Brexit vote. \u201cEstimated fourth quarter GDP growth was marked up slightly from 0.6% to 0.7% due primarily to stronger estimated growth in manufacturing. This was linked also to a combination of stronger export growth on the back of a more competitive pound and a gradually strengthening world economy. \u201cConsumer spending growth also remained solid in the fourth quarter as a whole, although the latest retail sales figures suggest that this has shown signs of tailing off in December and January. \u201cLess positively, estimated annual GDP growth in 2016 was revised down from 2% to 1.8%, pushing the UK slightly below Germany (1.9%) in the G7 growth league, though the difference is well within the margin of error on any such early GDP estimates. \u201cThe main reason for the downward revision seems to have been weaker North Sea oil and gas production during the first half of 2016; however, this is a sector-specific trend that does not really reflect the underlying strength of the UK economy. Excluding oil and gas output, estimated UK GDP growth might actually have been revised up in 2016. Reuters have also spotted that Britain has lost its crown as the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy: Today\u2019s growth report shows that fears of an immediate recession if Britain voted to leave the EU were misplaced. But...the fall in business investment is a concern, says Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cFar from slowing down after the vote to leave the EU, GDP growth actually picked up in the second half of the year. However, there were some signs that Brexit uncertainty is starting to have some impact on the corporate sector, with business investment down during the last three months, combined with slower growth in consumer spending. Britain appears to have lost its claim to be the fastest-growing major economy. Despite the strong expansion in Q4, growth for 2016 as a whole has been revised down to 1.8%, from 2%. That\u2019s slower than Germany, which grew by 1.9% last year, but still ahead of the US which only managed 1.6% growth. Now, all those numbers could also be revised in the future. But right now, chancellor Philip Hammond won\u2019t be able to boast about the fastest growth in the G7 when he gives next month\u2019s budget speech. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS, has warned that consumer spending has tailed off in recent months. Overall, the dominant services sector continued to grow steadily, due in part to continued growth in consumer spending, although retail showed some signs of weakness in the last couple of months of 2016, which has continued into January 2017. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics is concerned that Britons are spending beyond their means.... The City has given today\u2019s growth report a rather muted reception. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, says that last year\u2019s growth figures are rather ancient history. \u201cUK GDP may have gained some momentum into the end of 2016 but recent news from UK seems to have shown that that momentum has been lost in the early weeks of 2017. Services growth is set to slow, buffeted by rising inflation and slowing real wage gains and a consumer that is not waving but drowning, business investment remains poor given uncertainty over the negotiations between the UK and the EU following the Brexit vote last summer and while trade was stronger on the quarter this is purely a function of the devaluation of the pound Several economists are concerned by the fall in UK business spending (or \u2018gross fixed capital formation\u2019) in the last quarter. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group explains why it might be a problem: Jo Michell, economist lecturer at Bristol Business School, is also concerned by the 1% drop in business spending: Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that Britain\u2019s pharmaceuticals sector had a good quarter: Overall, manufacturing output surged by 1.2% during the quarter. Here\u2019s Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation: \u201cThe UK economy performed more strongly that first estimated at the end of 2016, aided by a particularly solid quarter for manufacturing growth. The resilience of the UK economy, particularly in the latter part of 2016 has been supported by a robust support from net trade and a rapid post-referendum recovery on consumer\u2019s confidence to keep spending. But... \u201cThe UK economy is rarely without its weak points and at the end of 2016 it was business investment. Capital expenditure by businesses saw a contraction in the final months of last year contributing the first year-on-year contraction in business investment since 2009. It\u2019s too soon to declare this an worrying omen for 2017, especially as more recent survey indicators have been signalling a more positive trend. But..in a worrying signal, UK business investment fell by 1% in the last quarter. The ONS reports that there was \u201ca slowdown within business investment\u201d in the last three months of 2016. This was driven by subdued growth within the \u201cICT equipment and other machinery and equipment\u201d assets. As this chart shows, Britain\u2019s economy has just posted its fastest quarterly growth in a year. Today\u2019s report shows that net trade helped to drive Britain\u2019s economic growth in the last quarter 0f 2016. Net trade added 1.3 percentage points to the UK growth rate in October to December, says the ONS. That reverses a 1.2% decline in the third quarter. Breaking! Britain economy grew faster than expected in the final three months of 2016! GDP expanded by 0.7% in the October-December quarter, according to new estimates from the Office for National Statistics, up from 0.6%. That\u2019s because industrial output was stronger than expected -- growing by 0.3%, not flat as first thought. Construction output has been revised up to 0.2%, from 0.1%. The figures also show that the service sector drove the recovery, by expanding by 0.8% (in line with initial forecasts) But it\u2019s not all good news.... Q4 year-on-year growth has been revised down to 2.0%, from 2.2%. More to follow... It\u2019s possible, although unlikely, that Britain\u2019s growth rate for the last quarter could be revised higher in a few minutes, from 0.6% to 0.7%. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say: The first estimate of Q4 GDP growth was 0.6% q/q in real terms. Since then we have learnt that favourable revisions to industrial production added 0.04ppts to headline GDP growth with marginally positive news in the construction sector too. This clearly means the prospect of an upward revision to GDP needs to be considered. However, as a central case our forecast is that Q4 GDP is confirmed at 0.6% q/q, as the preliminary estimate had an index level which translated into 0.56% to two decimal places. So, even with the known upward revisions it still isn\u2019t sufficient to turn into an upgrade to 0.7% q/q. Economist Shaun Richards agrees that an upgrade is possible: Newsflash: German business confidence has risen this month, according to the IFO thinktank. IFO\u2019s business confidence index index has unexpected come in at 111.0, beating forecasts, and ahead of 109.9 in January. The euro has now fallen its lowest level against a basket of currencies since last november, says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale. He says: Political risk is beginning to the Euro in earnest, reflected by the Euro\u2019s trade-weighted value reaching the lowest levels since the US Presidential election, and the OAT/Bund spread reaching the widest levels since then as well. Looking further back, we last had an OAT/Bund spread this wide in November 2012. OAT/Bund spread = the difference between France and Germany\u2019s borrowing costs. Kit also predicts further weakness as the French election approaches. Bloomberg have now been tracking the implied probability of the main candidates winning from Oddschecker for just over a month and Marine le Pen\u2019s odds have risen steadily over that period while Emmanuel Macron and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon\u2019s have varied more. The net result is that all three are virtually level-pegging now. So much uncertainty with 9 weeks to go until the first round of the election means we will probably see nervousness persist, and undermine the Euro across the board. Housebuilder Barratt is also having a good morning, after it reported a 9% jump in profits for the last year. London\u2019s stock market is rising in early trading, led by Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds shares have gained almost 4% after it reported profits had more than doubled to \u00a34.2bn over the last year. Lloyds told the City that: \u201cOur performance is inextricably linked to the health of theUK economy which has been more resilient than the market expected post referendum.\u201d Lloyds army of small shareholders will share a payout of over \u00a32bn; the bank will pay a special 0.5p dividend per share, on top of a 2.55p ordinary dividend. Boom! The German DAX share index has hit 12,000 points for the first time since April 2015. Shares in German exporters are up, thanks to the weak euro (which makes them more competitive). Industrial giant Thyssenkrupp is leading the charge, up 4.6% after agreeing to sell its Brazilian steel business. Worries over the French election are also driving investors into the safety of German debt. This has pushed the interest rate on two-year bonds to a fresh record low of -0.87% this morning. That means investors are paying more than the face value of the bonds, so they\u2019ll make a loss if they hold them to maturity (although they can sell them to the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus programme instead) The pound has his a two-month high against the euro, as European political worries weigh on the single currency. Sterling has gained half a eurocent to \u20ac1.188 for the first time since 21 December, meaning one euro now only buys 84.17p. The euro is also losing ground against the US dollar; down 0.25% at $1.0507. The euro\u2019s weakness shows that mounting concern that Marine Le Pen could become the next president of France, and potentially trigger the country\u2019s exit from the single currency. Kathleen Brooks of City Index believes that as Le Pen victory could be curtains for the euro. No one seems optimistic about the political future. Marine Le Pen in France is now the front-runner to win the first round of the French Presidential election, and her prospects are also improving for the second round. This has caused the spread between French and German yields to surge, and we expect this to continue. Political risk also weighed on the EUR/USD, which managed to hold above key 1.0500 support but still looks vulnerable as victory for Eurosceptic Le Pen could spell the end for the single currency. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re about to get a more detailed look at how Britain\u2019s economy performed in the last quarter. Updated GDP figures, due at 9.30am, will probably confirm that the economy expanded by a robust 0.6% in October to December - driven by the service sector. This second-estimate of GDP will also outline outline how government spending, household consumption, business investment and trade fared over the quarter - so it\u2019s rather more comprehensive than the preliminary report issued a month ago. Overall, it will show whether Britain\u2019s economy is really taking the Brexit vote in its stride, or if consumers and businesses are starting to trim back. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The weakness of the pound is expected to help exports contribute 2%, while imports are expected to fall from 1.4% to 0.5%. Services are still expected to provide the majority of the expansion at 0.8%, though a little worryingly business investment is expected to stall. Also coming up today At 9am, the latest IFO survey of German confidence is released - showing how firms in Europe\u2019s largest economy feel about current conditions, and future prospects. A \u2018flash\u2019 estimate of eurozone inflation for February is published at 10am GMT. Economists predict at consumer prices rose by 1.8% annually, matching January\u2019s figure. We\u2019re getting financial results from Lloyds Banking Group, recruitment firm Hays, housebuilder Barratt Homes, outsourcing group Serco, and high-end confectioner Hotel Chocolat. The good news for Lloyds shareholders is that the bank has posted its biggest profits in a decade, as it finally puts the trauma of the financial crisis behind it. There\u2019s a special dividend in the offing too.... America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, will release the minutes of its last meeting at 7pm GMT (2pm East Coast). They may contain hints on how close the Fed is to raising interest rates next month. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s profits have more than doubled as the bailed-out bank shrugged off the Brexit vote and avoided further hefty charges for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI). Lloyds\u2019 profits of \u00a34.2bn are the highest for a decade and the bank\u2019s shares rose 4% after it promised a dividend of 3.05p a share \u2013 including a 0.5p one-off special payout. The government was expected to cut its holding in the bank, which stood at 43% after the 2008 bailout and is on course to fall below 4% in the coming days. The bonus pool increased by 11% while Lloyds\u2019 chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, was paid \u00a35.5m for 2016. His basic salary is increasing to \u00a31.2m, the second stage of pay rise from \u00a31m two years ago. A total of 58 Lloyds\u2019 bankers were paid more than \u00a31m. The Portuguese banker has rattled off the changes since he took the helm in March 2011 that have allowed the government to cut its stake. Horta-Os\u00f3rio insisted he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to stay at the bank and promised a new strategy \u2013 his third three-year plan \u2013 later in 2017, with a focus on costs. \u201cThe job is never done,\u201d he said. The bank\u2019s chairman, Lord Blackwell, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of complacency here ... There is a still a lot to do. Our objective is to make Lloyds into a great British institution.\u201d As well as owning Halifax and Bank of Scotland (HBOS), the group owns 200,000 cars through its leasing business, provides financing for car deals through Black Horse \u2013 where lending increased 20% during the year \u2013 and is in the process of buying the MBNA credit card business. Profits, which were just \u00a31.6bn a year ago, have been weighed down in recent years by the \u00a350bn cost of bad lending at HBOS \u2013 the bank Lloyds took over during the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 and \u00a317bn of charges to cover PPI compensation. Last year the PPI charge was \u00a31bn, down from \u00a34bn a year ago. However, the bank set aside a further \u00a31bn during the year for other compensation payouts, including a new \u00a3475m bill for mis-selling packaged bank accounts and to compensate mortgage customers whose arrears were miscalculated. There was no provision for about 100 customers affected by the HBOS Reading fraud \u2013 for which two former HBOS bankers were jailed. The provisions meant the bank sliced 19% off its bonus pool \u2013 taking it to \u00a3393m, still 11% higher than last year. With the provisions and other one-off items stripped out, underlying profits were down as revenue slipped and bad debts rose 14%. Even so Horta-Os\u00f3rio was pleased with the performance. \u201cGiven our UK focus, our performance is inextricably linked to the health of the UK economy, which has been more resilient than the market expected post-referendum, with GDP growth of 2% in 2016. The UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union means the exact nature of our relationship with Europe going forward remains unclear and the economic outlook is uncertain,\u201d he said. His pay fell from \u00a38.7m a year ago, because of a reduced value of a three-year pay deal. His annual bonus rose from \u00a3850,000 to \u00a31.2m and he could be handed shares worth about \u00a33.5m under a new three-year scheme. Lloyds\u2019 shares plunged to 48p after the referendum result in July and have since risen 40%, but they remain below the 73.6p average price during the \u00a320bn bailout. Their 4% rise after the 2016 results were announced took the price to 69p. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said the bank was increasing its guidance for profits \u2013 measured by net interest margin \u2013 for this year. \u201cGuidance for 2017 would appear to be better than implied by consensus market estimates, notably in respect of the net interest margin but also on the impairment ratio and capital generation,\u201d he said. But there was some scepticism about the bank\u2019s ability to achieve these goals. Sandy Chen at the brokers Cenkos said: \u201cWe don\u2019t see much to revise our long-held scepticism about Lloyds\u2019 ability to achieve its lofty long-term targets.\u201d It is not clear what impact any new strategy will have on jobs: more than 50,000 job losses have been announced since the HBOS rescue.",

Our objective is to make Lloyds into a great British institution.\u201d</p> <p>As well as owning Halifax and Bank of Scotland (HBOS), the group owns 200,000 cars through its leasing business, provides financing for car deals through Black Horse \u2013 where lending increased 20% during the year \u2013 and is in the process of buying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/20/lloyds-snaps-up-mbna-for-19bn\">the MBNA credit card business</a>.</p> <p>Profits, which were just \u00a31.6bn a year ago, have been weighed down in recent years by the \u00a350bn cost of bad lending at HBOS \u2013 the bank Lloyds took over during the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 and \u00a317bn of charges to cover PPI compensation.</p> <p>Last year the PPI charge was \u00a31bn, down from \u00a34bn a year ago. </p> <p>However, the bank set aside a further \u00a31bn during the year for other compensation payouts, including a new \u00a3475m bill for mis-selling packaged bank accounts and to compensate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/19/borrowers-mortgage-arrears-compensation-fca\">mortgage customers whose arrears were miscalculated</a>. There was no provision for about 100 customers affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/07/lloyds-hbos-loan-scam-lynden-scourfield-compensation\">the HBOS Reading</a> fraud \u2013 for which two former HBOS bankers were jailed.</p> <p>The provisions meant the bank sliced 19% off its bonus pool \u2013 taking it to \u00a3393m, still 11% higher than last year.</p> <p>With the provisions and other one-off items stripped out, underlying profits were down as revenue slipped and bad debts rose 14%. </p> <p>Even so Horta-Os\u00f3rio was pleased with the performance. \u201cGiven our UK focus, our performance is inextricably linked to the health of the UK economy, which has been more resilient than the market expected post-referendum, with GDP growth of 2% in 2016. The UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union means the exact nature of our relationship with Europe going forward remains unclear and the economic outlook is uncertain,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His pay fell from \u00a38.7m a year ago, because of a reduced value of a three-year pay deal. His annual bonus rose from \u00a3850,000 to \u00a31.2m and he could be handed shares worth about \u00a33.5m under a new three-year scheme.</p> <p>Lloyds\u2019 shares plunged to 48p after the referendum result in July and have since risen 40%, but they remain below the 73.6p average price during the \u00a320bn bailout. Their 4% rise after the 2016 results were announced took the price to 69p.</p> <p>Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said the bank was increasing its guidance for profits \u2013 measured by net interest margin \u2013 for this year. \u201cGuidance for 2017 would appear to be better than implied by consensus market estimates, notably in respect of the net interest margin but also on the impairment ratio and capital generation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But there was some scepticism about the bank\u2019s ability to achieve these goals. Sandy Chen at the brokers Cenkos said: \u201cWe don\u2019t see much to revise our long-held scepticism about Lloyds\u2019 ability to achieve its lofty long-term targets.\u201d</p> <p>It is not clear what impact any new strategy will have on jobs: more than 50,000 job losses have been announced since the HBOS rescue.</p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "The business secretary, Greg Clark, has pledged to outline how the government should respond to foreign takeovers of crucial UK firms in the wake of Kraft Heinz\u2019s failed \u00a3115bn bid for Unilever. Speaking at a conference in London, Clark said he would draft proposals in the coming weeks to show how ministers should handle controversial takeover bids, including bids for infrastructure projects by foreign corporations. The move comes amid growing concerns that the Brexit vote and steep fall in the value of the pound could trigger a wave of predatory takeovers of big British firms. Clark said: \u201cWe have taken the opportunity to look at our arrangements to make sure they are kept up to date. We have said we would do that in the context of mergers, particularly if it relates to critical infrastructure, as outlined by the Hinkley Point C decision. So we will be setting out some proposals in the weeks ahead.\u201d Theresa May finally gave the go-ahead for the new power plant in Somerset in September, after alarming the French and Chinese partnership that will deliver the project by putting the whole scheme under review. At the same time as giving the green light to Hinkley, the government announced a review of its approach to the ownership and control of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d. \u201cThis will allow the UK government to introduce a consistent approach to considering the national security implications of all significant investments in critical infrastructure, including nuclear energy, in the future,\u201d it said at the time. \u201cThe changes mean that, while the UK will remain one of the most open economies in the world, the public can be confident that foreign direct investment works in the country\u2019s best interests.\u201d Clark\u2019s remarks on Wednesday followed his pledge about the government\u2019s \u201cunbounded commitment\u201d to protecting jobs at the carmaker Vauxhall. Fears are growing about plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton as the French owner of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn, PSA Group, presses ahead with talks to buy General Motors\u2019 European business, which includes Opel in Germany and Vauxhall in the UK. Clark said on Wednesday that Peugeot recognised the contribution of the two UK plants. \u201cThere was a recognition, which I emphasised, of the contribution to the performance of Vauxhall of the two plants and indeed the other operations that they have in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are efficient, they are successful and there was a clear recognition of that by PSA.\u201d His comments also follow last week\u2019s \u00a3115bn takeover bid for Unilever by Kraft Heinz. The US company walked away after the Anglo-Dutch maker of brands such as Persil, Marmite and PG Tips said the offer had \u201cno merit, strategic or financial\u201d. Last year the Japanese investment corporation Softbank bought one of the UK\u2019s most prestigious technology companies, ARM Holdings, for \u00a324bn, sparking fears that the fall in the currency made UK firms more vulnerable. May\u2019s government welcomed the ARM deal. However, a week earlier in her campaign speech shortly before she became prime minister, May signalled a willingness to take a more interventionist role in foreign takeovers. She highlighted Kraft\u2019s takeover of Cadbury\u2019s, and Pfizer\u2019s failed bid for AstraZeneca, as examples of deals that could have benefited from closer government scrutiny. \u201cA proper industrial strategy wouldn\u2019t automatically stop the sale of British firms to foreign ones, but it should be capable of stepping in to defend a sector that is as important as pharmaceuticals is to Britain,\u201d May said. Stephen Martin, director general at the Institute of Directors, said the government was right to make sure there were checks and balances on foreign direct investment and takeovers. \u201cHowever, the combination of shareholders, the Takeover Panel and the Competition and Markets Authority seems to us a good framework and government must be clear what the goal of any additional powers should be. \u201cIn a world increasingly enticed by isolationism, Britain has to do more to demonstrate that it is keen to play a part on the global stage. During the referendum campaign, we were promised that Britain will be the loudest voice for free trade and free markets on the global stage; let\u2019s ensure that voice remains strong.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s big six energy suppliers are under pressure to pass on more price hikes to consumers\u2019 energy bills, the industry trade body has warned. Npower, EDF and Scottish Power have already announced price rises for millions of customers, blaming a mix of rising wholesale costs, installation of smart meters and government policies paid for through bills. British Gas has frozen prices until August, while SSE and E.ON have yet to declare their intentions. The chief executive of Energy UK, which represents most of the 40-plus energy suppliers, told MPs on Wednesday that the rises were justified. \u201cIt is plain that we have seen increases in wholesale prices over the last 12 months or so, and we can see going out into the future there are continuing pressures there,\u201d said Lawrence Slade. He said month-ahead wholesale gas prices for March were 100% higher than last year, and electricity was up 69%. In addition, the cost of government policies, such as subsidies added to bills to support renewable power, \u201cshould not be underplayed\u201d, he said. Such costs would make up \u00a3120 to \u00a3140 of the average annual household energy bill next year, Energy UK said. Slade refused to say whether he thought Npower\u2019s recent electricity price increase of 15% was acceptable and said he had no knowledge of individual companies\u2019 future pricing plans. But the head of the energy regulator, Ofgem, dismissed the idea that government policies or smart meters were adding significantly to suppliers\u2019 costs, and said increasing fossil fuel prices were the main pressure. Dermot Nolan told MPs on the Commons business, energy and industrial committee said: \u201cThere were comments by a number of firms saying it was government policy or smart metering [driving hikes]. I don\u2019t think the government policy is particularly valid on this point. I don\u2019t think smart metering by itself will be driving significant increases.\u201d He argued it was \u201chard for me to judge\u201d whether Npower had justified the increase in its standard variable tariff. When pushed by the committee chairman, the Labour MP Iain Wright, on whether the regulator could cap such tariffs and if he was failing consumers by not doing so, the Ofgem chief executive said he did have such powers but the decision was one for policymakers, not him. Despite acknowledging that the big six still had an 84% share of the market, Nolan told the MPs that the energy market was becoming more competitive. In a reference to the challenger companies First Utility and Ovo, he said the UK was moving towards having a big eight rather than big six. Calls for a price cap, as proposed by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are likely to be repeated in coming days. On Wednesday, ScottishPower\u2019s parent company, Iberdrola, announced net profit was up 11.7% to \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.3bn) in 2016, and on Thursday the parent company of British Gas, Centrica, is expected to report that full-year earnings rose from \u00a3891m to \u00a3950m for its UK energy business. It is also anticipated that one of the medium-sized energy suppliers would announce a price rise on Thursday. John Penrose, a Conservative MP, has written to the business secretary, Greg Clark, urging him to impose a relative price cap, so standard variable tariffs were not more than 6% above the company\u2019s best deal.",

      "bodyText": "Unilever has upgraded profit margin expectations and announced a \u201ccomprehensive review of options\u201d to improve value for shareholders in an apparent effort to shore itself up against a renewed bid from the US food group Kraft Heinz. The Anglo-Dutch company knocked back a \u00a3115bn bid from Kraft on Friday, and 48 hours later its US rival withdrew its bid, with both sides saying talks had ended \u201camicably\u201d. Kraft is now blocked from renewing its interest for six months under the UK\u2019s takeover code, while Unilever has expressed confidence in the support it has from long-term investors. But management, led by the chief executive, Paul Polman, is thought to have been surprised that Unilever could be seen as an acquisition target and released two statements outlining plans to ensure shareholders wouldn\u2019t be tempted by further takeover bids. In a statement to the stock market, the company said it was \u201cconducting a comprehensive review of options available to accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders\u201d. \u201cThe events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever. We expect the review to be completed by early April, after which we will communicate further.\u201d The announcement is likely to revive suggestions that Unilever could look to sell its struggling standalone spreads business. The company could also examine ways to boost the company\u2019s share price by stepping up efforts to squeeze costs, a strategy that would make a renewed tilt by Kraft Heinz more expensive if successful. Unilever issued a second statement saying its forecast profit margins were already improving after it moved to cut costs last year. \u201cThe management of Unilever now expects core operating margin improvement for 2017 to be at the upper end of its 40-80 basis points guidance,\u201d the company said. Shares in the company climbed 3% following the statement, having soared 13% to a record high when Kraft\u2019s interest was revealed on Friday and fallen back 8% on Monday. Unilever\u2019s decision to take action immediately after becoming a bid target suggests management believes Kraft could renew its interest after its billionaire backers tasted a rare defeat. Warren Buffett\u2019s investment group Berkshire Hathaway and buyout house 3G, backed by the Brazilian billionaire Jorge Lemann, own 51% of Kraft Heinz between them. The duo are famed for their deal-making prowess, founded on a strategy of driving profits by slashing costs.",

    "webTitle": "Amazon, Deliveroo and Uber 'still viable' with no gig economy workers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Amazon, Deliveroo and Uber have admitted their businesses would remain viable if they were no longer allowed to rely on self-employed workers who do not receive sick pay, pensions or a guaranteed minimum wage. Senior executives working for the three firms, as well as the delivery company Hermes, told MPs that a change in the law being considered by the government to give more workers in the so-called gig economy basic employment protections would not force their businesses to close. The admission was made to the House of Commons work and pensions committee, which is chaired by the Labour MP Frank Field, during a 90-minute hearing in which senior MPs strongly criticised the companies for using self-employed workers to avoid significant costs including national insurance and pensions contributions. The Conservative MP Heidi Allen demanded to know: \u201cWhen are you going to start paying people properly?\u201d And Field told the bosses: \u201cYou are asking people to commit to your companies but you are not committing to them in terms of sick pay, and other things. You are pushing the boundary here.\u201d The Tory MP James Cartlidge said that given the cost of pensions and benefits to the taxpayer, \u201cthe more that people are in this pseudo-employment, the more we all feel that the state is picking up the bill\u201d. Dan Warne, the managing director of Deliveroo, which uses 15,000 riders to deliver from restaurants and takeaways, defended the practice. \u201cWe adopt a highly flexible model with all those riders, which is the reason why we have self-employment,\u201d he said. \u201cWith our fee-per-delivery model, riders are paid for each delivery they do, and they are allowed to log in whenever they like, for whatever duration they like while at the same time working for other companies.\u201d But the exchequer is facing a \u00a36bn shortfall in national insurance revenue by the beginning of the next decade as a result of the rapid growth of self-employment in the UK \u2013 up by about 1 million people since 2009, the Resolution Foundation thinktank said earlier this week. Theresa May has ordered a review of the trend, which is expected to lead to recommendations for the law to be changed. Several employment tribunal cases have ruled that gig economy workers, including for Uber, should not be classed as self-employed contractors. The Resolution Foundation calculated that 40% of the growth in UK self-employment since 2009 was in more \u201cprecarious\u201d sectors, such as construction and cleaning, and earnings from self-employment had fallen from more than \u00a3300 to below \u00a3250 a week during the last decade. By contrast, the percentage of self-employed in the workforces of the US, Germany, Japan and Italy is falling. The four giant gig-economy companies together use tens of thousands of self-employed staff, many in effect working full-time, but told MPs that self-employment gave workers flexibility they valued highly. However, when asked by the Labour MP Steve McCabe if they would have to shut if they could not use so many self-employed workers, Warne said Deliveroo \u201cwould not close down\u201d. \u201cWe would continue to operate as a business,\u201d said Carole Woodhead, the chief executive of Hermes, which uses 10,000 self-employed couriers. She said the company would probably begin using a smaller number of full-time workers. Lesley Smith, Amazon\u2019s director of public policy in the UK and Ireland, and Andrew Byrne, Uber\u2019s head of public policy in the UK and Ireland, also confirmed their businesses would remain viable. The MPs\u2019 cross-examination came amid growing pressure on the gig economy companies. Woodhead revealed that officials from Revenue &amp; Customs gathered evidence from Hermes in December about its employment model and pay, which is part of an investigation triggered by a Guardian expos\u00e9 last July that earnings among some Hermes couriers were below the national minimum wage. Uber lost an employment tribunal case that ruled that self-employed drivers should be considered workers and so receive the guaranteed minimum wage. Deliveroo was revealed to have included a clause in its contracts with riders that prohibits them from challenging their self-employed status in the courts. Pressed on this by Allen, Warne said this would be removed from contracts in the coming weeks. \u201cThere is no need to have it there,\u201d Warne said.",

    "webTitle": "Barratt to pay out more to shareholders despite London sales slump", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders has surprised shareholders with an enhanced cash payout, despite its decision to cut prices on some of its most expensive homes in London amid waning demand. Brushing aside any uncertainty over the Brexit vote, Barratt Developments said it was sufficiently confident in the outlook for the housing market to extend its capital return plan, including special dividend payments of \u00a3175m in November 2017 and November 2018. Pre-tax profit in the first half rose almost by 9% to \u00a3321m, beating analysts\u2019 expectations and helping to drive shares 2% higher, making Barratt one of the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 on Wednesday. The company also increased the interim dividend by more than a fifth to 7.3p a share for the six months to 31 December. Clyde Lewis, an analyst at Peel Hunt, described the improved payout as \u201ca nice surprise\u201d. Late last year Barratt cut prices on some of its most expensive homes in central London. It said demand for its \u00a31m-plus properties had increased since it lowered their prices. The company has reached a build and sale agreement with an undisclosed institutional investor on 118 apartments at a development close to Vauxhall tube station in south London, where units cost on average \u00a3800,000 to \u00a3900,000. It leaves Barratt with a further 300 homes to sell on the site. Under a build and sale arrangement, a housebuilder usually sells at a reduced price but avoids the cost and uncertainty of running show homes and offices from the new development. \u201cWe believe it de-risks the Nine Elms site for us,\u201d said David Thomas, Barratt\u2019s chief executive. He said demand was good for properties under \u00a3600,000, both in the capital and across the UK. Thomas pointed out that London accounts for about 10% of Barratt\u2019s business in terms of completions.

      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from June 2006 to May 2009 The big economic stories this month were about prices, wages and spending and a decline in the number of workers in the UK from the EU. Inflation continued to rise in January, with the consumer prices index hitting 1.8%, the highest since June 2014 as fuel prices surged and the food price deflation enjoyed by shoppers in recent years continued to disappear. The weak pound continued to raise manufacturers\u2019 fuel and material costs which rose at the fastest pace for more than eight years. But more importantly the retail prices index measure of inflation, which is used in wage settlements, rose by 2.6%. This matters when the latest data on wage growth of total earnings showed a dramatic slowing from 2.9% in November to 1.9% in December. So prices are rising faster than wages. As a consequence, this month real earnings, measured in constant 2000 prices, fell from \u00a3343 to \u00a3341 a week. The buying power of a pay packet is down more than 4% from its pre-recession peak of \u00a3356 a week in April 2008. Hurt is returning for workers who inevitably will have to cut their spending. It surprised me, as it did the monetary policy committee, how much people were using up their savings to buy stuff, but this seems now to be coming to an end. It was not surprising then to see the worst bit of economic news this month, the fall in retail sales. Sales volumes fell for the third month running in January, dropping by 0.3%. Taking the latest three months together it was the weakest underlying sales performance for three years. This was the biggest story and may well be the start of something big. Prices rising, real wages and retail sales falling is not a good start to 2017. Of note also this month is the decline in the most recent quarter compared with the previous one of about 50,000 workers from the EU, who are apparently beginning to be frightened away by Brexit. The big question is whether this trend will continue. The UK is a less attractive place to work with the decline in the pound. The economy looks set to be slowing again. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 The pattern of economic data for the last two quarters of last year was quite clear \u2013 stronger than expected growth driven by consumer spending and a resilient global economy. The relatively good figures for public finances reflect that picture as tax receipts are generally a lagging economic indicator. But the evidence from the data for the first month of this year is more uncertain. Retail sales growth is now clearly being squeezed by rising inflation. So far, a general rise in global inflation is the main reason for this. At 1.8%, UK headline inflation is in line with the eurozone and lower than in the US. But as we move thorough this year we should expect to see more imported inflation following the decline in sterling since late 2015. This is already showing up in the fact that manufacturing input costs are up more than 20% on a year ago. So UK inflation could quite soon move up towards 3% and possibly higher as these price rises come through to retailers and consumers. Meanwhile, the labour market data continues to point to slowing employment growth, even though unemployment remains historically very low. Manufacturing industry continues to record respectable growth, according to business surveys, but it is the services sector that dominates the pattern of employment growth in the UK. All this suggests the consumer will be much less supportive of growth this year than last, and this will add to the impact of increased uncertainty on investment spending. We could well see the first clear signs of this slowdown in the GDP figures for the first quarter of this year when they are available in a few months.",

      "bodyText": "Rising fuel and food prices are eating into household budgets as the impact of the Brexit vote on the value of the pound pushes up inflation, according to a Guardian analysis that casts doubt over how much longer consumers can continue to shore up the UK economy. Cracks are starting to show in the picture of economic resilience seen since last summer\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Wage growth is slowing just as people\u2019s living costs start taking off. Businesses are also feeling the pressures of the weak pound more intensely as it ramps up the cost of imported raw materials and energy while failing to provide the anticipated boon for exporters. Eight months on from the referendum, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows business activity across a broad range of sectors has lost momentum, retail sales have fallen for three straight months and pay growth has slipped back despite the lowest unemployment rate for more than a decade. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for February shows a worse than expected performance in three of the eight categories. Two were better than expected and unemployment was as expected. The public finances undershot economists\u2019 forecasts in January, but mainly because of a change in a way the Office for National Statistics (ONS) accounts for tax revenues. Inflation continued to rise but by less than economists had forecast. At 1.8% inflation was the highest since mid-2014 and is expected to rise further this year thanks to higher crude oil prices and rising import costs. The latest official snapshot of living costs showed fuel cost 17% more this January than a year ago, the steepest price rise for more than five years. Consumers also had to pay more for many groceries as a long period of food price deflation appeared to be petering out. Fish, cooking fats, fruit and sugary foods were all more expensive compared with January 2016. But meat, dairy products and vegetables were still cheaper. Data published alongside the inflation figures showed manufacturers\u2019 fuel and material costs were rising at the fastest pace for more than eight years in January, jumping more than 20% on the year, and companies passed some of that on to customers. Fanning concerns about household budgets, wage growth missed expectations in the final quarter of 2016. The 2.6% year-on-year rise in average weekly earnings was still ahead of inflation but as the gap narrows there are warnings that incomes could soon be falling again in real terms. For December alone, wage growth slowed dramatically to 1.9%. Writing in the Guardian, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), David Blanchflower, said it was no surprise to see a tighter squeeze on households translate into falling sales in the shops. \u201cHurt is returning for workers who inevitably will have to cut their spending,\u201d said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US. \u201cPrices rising, real wages and retail sales falling is not a good start to 2017.\u201d The pressure on household finances bodes ill for the wider economy where consumer spending has been the main driver of relatively robust growth, helping the UK outperform all the other Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies last year. Figures today confirmed that the economy finished 2016 on a strong note, with the GDP growth rate for the fourth quarter nudged up to 0.7% from 0.6% as manufacturers and construction firms enjoyed a a December bounce. More timely indicators suggest rising labour, material and transport costs took their toll in companies in January, and growth slowed in the manufacturing, construction and services sectors. There was bad news for retailers in January as sales volumes dropped amid evidence higher prices made shoppers cut back. Economic forecasters are cautious, however, about predicting anything more than a modest slowdown in 2017 after consistently being proved wrong in the months after the referendum. The Bank surprised markets this month by raising its forecast for growth this year to 2% from 1.4% as it was again forced to concede it had been overly gloomy following the Brexit vote. It still sees higher prices weighing on consumer spending and expects economic growth to slow to just 1.6% in 2018. Those worries are seen pushing policymakers to keen interest rates at the record low of 0.25% well into next year. There was some upbeat news in the latest batch of economic indicators. Britain\u2019s trade position improved in the final quarter of the year, helped by a rise in exports to non-EU countries. But the ONS said there was little evidence so far of a boost to exports from a weaker pound, which in theory makes UK goods more competitive in overseas markets. The weak pound, which has dipped again this month, does appear to be helping tourism, however, with a record number of overseas visitors to the UK in 2016. House prices also beat economists\u2019 expectations in January, as growth rebounded following a December slowdown. Finally, in a boost to Philip Hammond ahead of his first budget as chancellor next month strong tax receipts helped improve the public finances in January and left him on track to bring the deficit down more than previously hoped over the full financial year. Andrew Sentance, also a former member of the MPC, said those relatively strong tax receipt figures reflected the picture in the second half of last year of stronger than expected growth driven by consumer spending and a resilient world economy. \u201cBut the evidence from the data for the first month of this year is more uncertain,\u201d added Sentance, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC. The labour market was showing signs of slowing and inflation would continue to rise, he said. \u201cAll this suggests that the consumer will be much less supportive of growth this year than last, and this will add to the impact of increased uncertainty on investment spending.\u201d",

Two were better than expected and unemployment was as expected. The public finances undershot economists\u2019 forecasts in January, but mainly because of a change in a way the Office for National Statistics (ONS) accounts for tax revenues. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/14/uk-inflation-rises-to-18-spurred-by-weak-pound-and-rising-fuel-costs\">Inflation continued to rise</a> but by less than economists had forecast. </p> <p>At 1.8% inflation was the highest since mid-2014 and is expected to rise further this year thanks to higher crude oil prices and rising import costs. The latest official snapshot of living costs showed fuel cost 17% more this January than a year ago, the steepest price rise for more than five years. <br></p> <p>Consumers also had to pay more for many groceries as a long period of food price deflation appeared to be petering out. Fish, cooking fats, fruit and sugary foods were all more expensive compared with January 2016. But meat, dairy products and vegetables were still cheaper.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/producerpriceinflation/jan2017\">Data published alongside the inflation figures</a> showed manufacturers\u2019 fuel and material costs were rising at the fastest pace for more than eight years in January, jumping more than 20% on the year, and companies passed some of that on to customers.</p> <p>Fanning concerns about household budgets, wage growth missed expectations in the final quarter of 2016. The 2.6% year-on-year rise in average weekly earnings was still ahead of inflation but as the gap narrows there are warnings that incomes could soon be falling again in real terms. For December alone, wage growth slowed dramatically to 1.9%.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2017/feb/22/how-has-the-brexit-vote-affected-the-uk-economy-february-verdict\">How has the Brexit vote affected the UK economy?

There was bad news for retailers in January as sales volumes dropped amid evidence higher prices made shoppers cut back.</p> <p>Economic forecasters are cautious, however, about predicting anything more than a modest slowdown in 2017 after consistently being proved wrong in the months after the referendum. </p> <p>The Bank surprised markets this month by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/02/bank-of-england-uk-growth-forecast-economy-brexit\">raising its forecast for growth this year to 2%</a> from 1.4% as it was again forced to concede it had been overly gloomy following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>It still sees higher prices weighing on consumer spending and expects economic growth to slow to just 1.6% in 2018. Those worries are seen pushing policymakers to keen interest rates at the record low of 0.25% well into next year.<br></p> <p>There was some upbeat news in the latest batch of economic indicators. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/10/uk-manufacturing-construction-ended-2016-strong-ons\">Britain\u2019s trade position improved in the final quarter of the year</a>, helped by a rise in exports to non-EU countries. But the ONS said there was little evidence so far of a boost to exports from a weaker pound, which in theory makes UK goods more competitive in overseas markets.</p> <p>The weak pound, which has dipped again this month, does appear to be helping tourism, however, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/17/fall-in-pound-after-brexit-vote-uk-break-overseas-visitors-record-ons-north-american-tourists\">a record number of overseas visitors to the UK in 2016</a>.</p> <p>House prices also beat economists\u2019 expectations in January, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/09/uk-rents-rise-faster-house-prices-next-five-years-rics-survey\">growth rebounded following a December slowdown</a>. </p> <p>Finally, in a boost to Philip Hammond ahead of his first budget as chancellor next month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/21/bumper-tax-receipts-swell-public-finances-in-january\">strong tax receipts helped improve the public finances in January</a> and left him on track to bring the deficit down more than previously hoped over the full financial year. </p> <p>Andrew Sentance, also a former member of the MPC, said those relatively strong tax receipt figures reflected the picture in the second half of last year of stronger than expected growth driven by consumer spending and a resilient world economy. <br></p> <p>\u201cBut the evidence from the data for the first month of this year is more uncertain,\u201d added Sentance, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC.</p> <p>The labour market was showing signs of slowing and inflation would continue to rise, he said.</p> <p>\u201cAll this suggests that the consumer will be much less supportive of growth this year than last, and this will add to the impact of increased uncertainty on investment spending.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Knocked off the front pages by Brexit and Donald Trump, Greece is back on the agenda. The country\u2019s two most important creditors will meet in Berlin on Wednesday when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, hosts the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. It could be a fateful meeting. Europe and the IMF have been at loggerheads for months over whether Greece will ever be able to repay its debts \u2013 a disagreement that has stopped the Washington-based fund from signing up to a \u20ac86bn-bailout programme crafted by EU leaders in July 2015. Merkel and other European leaders, who face elections, are anxious to bring the IMF on board, to persuade sceptical voters the bailout is credible. Now signs of a compromise are emerging. This week eurozone leaders echoed the IMF in talking of the end of austerity, increasing the chances the fund will join the Greek bailout. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic affairs, reported that 19 finance ministers of the single currency agreed that the Greek people needed to see \u201clight at the end of the tunnel of austerity\u201d. But while the bailout chiefs are poised to agree on a route map, the journey for the Greek people seems no less long and arduous. The crux of the dispute between the IMF and EU is a European demand for Greece to maintain a budget surplus of 3.5% for a decade from 2018, a feat few governments in the world have managed, much less one in a country with a 23% unemployment rate. The IMF has been arguing for months that Greece cannot meet this target. \u201cGreece does not need more austerity at this time,\u201d two senior IMF officials wrote in a recent blog post, adding that the target for a primary budget surplus \u2013 the gap between government income and spending, excluding interest payments and national debt \u2013 would generate \u201ca degree of austerity that could prevent the nascent recovery from taking hold\u201d. The EU maintains that the 3.5% target is achievable. But after a meeting of eurozone ministers on Monday, European creditors edged closer to the IMF view that more focus is needed on economic reforms, less on austerity. To deliver these \u201cdeep reforms\u201d, all sides agreed that EU and IMF bailout inspectors will return to Athens soon to discuss an overhaul of Greece\u2019s tax and pension systems, as well as labour market reforms. In Athens commentators have been desperately trying to decode the Eurogroup agreement. It was not lost on many that what was being billed as an \u201cagreement to agree\u201d \u2013 the key to allowing bailout auditors to finally return to Greece and resume stalled talks \u2013 had been struck exactly two years to the day after a similar accord by the country\u2019s leftist-led government. Then, the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, had signed up to a temporary deal that allowed \u201cfiscal breathing space\u201d before embarking on six months of nail-biting negotiations that eventually led to Athens accepting the harshest terms attached to a bailout since the crisis began. Despite the change in tone \u2013 and talk of a new policy mix \u2013 the consensus was that Monday\u2019s agreement of \u201ccommon understanding\u201d amounted to much of the same with reforms becoming the new byword for further cuts. After vowing not to undertake more austerity, Tsipras\u2019 fragile two-party coalition found itself on the back foot, accused across the board of crossing its own red lines. \u201cThe government is trying to save its image claiming that the policy mix is supposedly changing,\u201d the Greek daily Ta Nea proclaimed from its front page. \u201cBut the only thing it has achieved is the pre-legislation of harsh measures that the troika [European commission, European Central Bank and IMF] will approve when it returns.\u201d \u201cWhat we are seeing is a war of propaganda, a lot of doublespeak,\u201d Dimitris Tsiodras, spokesman of the centrist Potami party told the Guardian. \u201cThe only thing that has been attained, in reality, is the return of the troika.\u201d How Tsipras will sell the concessions to his compatriots, including increasingly disillusioned members of his own Syriza party, will play a central role in whether Greece now plunges into renewed political turmoil. Addressing reporters, the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos ratcheted up the rhetoric, calling on Germany to see sense now that all sides had made concessions. \u201cWe expect the German finance ministry to take back its unreasonable demand for [Greece to achieve] primary surpluses of 3.5% for a decade and to adopt a more constructive stance so that a reduction of the Greek debt over the medium term can be agreed.\u201d Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform, a thinktank, said he believed the IMF and eurozone would find a compromise, whereby the fund signed up to the 3.5% target for a limited period of time, as the price of stabilising the eurozone in an election year. \u201cMy feeling is they will largely settle for a fig leaf. It will be made to look as if the pace of austerity has been eased, ie that the eurozone will agree that the size of the primary budget surplus will be reassessed at some specified point in the future.\u201d \u201cAll we are going to see us another round of extend and pretend.\u201d He added that this would not do anything \u201csignificant to alleviate the pressure we see on Greece\u201d. He pointed out that even a primary budget surplus of 1.5% (favoured by the IMF) \u201cwould still mean ongoing austerity in Greece\u201d. The IMF\u2019s reforms may also prove politically difficult to sell to a population reeling from nearly eight years in the EU\u2019s bailout regime. One of the IMF\u2019s key demands is an overhaul of the Greek tax system to ensure more middle-class professionals pay their dues. More than 50% of Greek wage earners do not pay income tax, compared with 8% in the rest of the eurozone. But the low tax take partly reflects the economic collapse that has pushed down wages and squeezed people out of regular work. Reforming pensions, another IMF priority, may also run into trouble. The fund wants to rein in \u201cextremely generous\u201d Greek pensions that absorb 11% of national income. But Greek pensions have already been slashed since 2010, with 43% of pensioners living on \u20ac660 a month, compared with an average annual income of \u20ac20,000 for over-65s in other eurozone countries, according to government figures. Many Greek pensioners are also supporting unemployed children and grandchildren, as other benefits have been cut. With these politically tough reforms ahead, the light at the end of tunnel looks dim and distant. \u201cGreeks are facing ongoing austerity into the foreseeable future,\u201d Tilford says.",

The country\u2019s two most important creditors will meet in Berlin on Wednesday when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, hosts the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. </p> <p>It could be a fateful meeting. Europe and the IMF have been at loggerheads for months over whether Greece will ever be able to repay its debts \u2013 a disagreement that has stopped the Washington-based fund from signing up to a \u20ac86bn-bailout programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/13/greece-bailout-agreement-key-points-grexit\">crafted by EU leaders in July 2015</a>. Merkel and other European leaders, who face elections, are anxious to bring the IMF on board, to persuade sceptical voters the bailout is credible.</p> <p>Now signs of a compromise are emerging. This week eurozone leaders echoed the IMF in talking of the end of austerity, increasing the chances the fund will join the Greek bailout. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic affairs, reported that 19 finance ministers of the single currency agreed that the Greek people needed to see \u201clight at the end of the tunnel of austerity\u201d. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/20/greece-stand-off-over-86bn-bailout-eases-as-inspectors-return-to-athens\">Greece standoff over \u20ac86bn bailout eases after Brussels deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while the bailout chiefs are poised to agree on a route map, the journey for the Greek people seems no less long and arduous. <br></p> <p>The crux of the dispute between the IMF and EU is a European demand for Greece to maintain a budget surplus of 3.5% for a decade from 2018, a feat few governments in the world have managed, much less one in a country with a 23% unemployment rate.</p> <p>The IMF has been arguing for months that Greece cannot meet this target. \u201cGreece does not need more austerity at this time,\u201d two senior IMF officials <a href=\"https://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2016/12/12/the-imf-is-not-asking-greece-for-more-austerity/\">wrote in a recent blog post</a>, adding that the target for a primary budget surplus \u2013 the gap between government income and spending, excluding interest payments and national debt \u2013 would generate \u201ca degree of austerity that could prevent the nascent recovery from taking hold\u201d.</p> <p>The EU maintains that the 3.5% target is achievable. But after a meeting of eurozone ministers on Monday, European creditors edged closer to the IMF view that more focus is needed on economic reforms, less on austerity. To deliver these \u201cdeep reforms\u201d, all sides agreed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/20/greece-stand-off-over-86bn-bailout-eases-as-inspectors-return-to-athens\">EU and IMF bailout inspectors will return to Athens</a> soon to discuss an overhaul of Greece\u2019s tax and pension systems, as well as labour market reforms.<br></p> <p>In Athens commentators have been desperately trying to decode the Eurogroup agreement.<br></p> <p>It was not lost on many that what was being billed as an \u201cagreement to agree\u201d \u2013 the key to allowing bailout auditors to finally return to Greece and resume stalled talks \u2013 had been struck exactly two years to the day after a similar accord by the country\u2019s leftist-led government. Then, the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, had signed up to a temporary deal that allowed \u201cfiscal breathing space\u201d before embarking on six months of nail-biting negotiations that eventually led to Athens accepting the harshest terms attached to a bailout since the crisis began.</p> <p>Despite the change in tone \u2013 and talk of a new policy mix \u2013 the consensus was that Monday\u2019s agreement of \u201ccommon understanding\u201d amounted to much of the same with reforms becoming the new byword for further cuts. </p> <p>After vowing not to undertake more austerity, Tsipras\u2019 fragile two-party coalition found itself on the back foot, accused across the board of crossing its own red lines. \u201cThe government is trying to save its image claiming that the policy mix is supposedly changing,\u201d the Greek daily Ta Nea proclaimed from its front page. \u201cBut the only thing it has achieved is the pre-legislation of harsh measures that the troika [European commission, European Central Bank and IMF] will approve when it returns.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are seeing is a war of propaganda, a lot of doublespeak,\u201d Dimitris Tsiodras, spokesman of the centrist Potami party told the Guardian. \u201cThe only thing that has been attained, in reality, is the return of the troika.\u201d</p> <p>How Tsipras will sell the concessions to his compatriots, including increasingly disillusioned members of his own Syriza party, will play a central role in whether Greece now plunges into renewed political turmoil.

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Reserve Bank says it is difficult to ignore the risk of rising household indebtedness in Australia, warning record-high household debt levels have started to affect spending. Dr Phil Lowe has said further increases in indebtedness could make household balance sheets more fragile, and if households soon decide they have borrowed too much, they may cut back consumption \u201csharply\u201d, hurting the economy and employment. \u201cIt is difficult to quantify this risk, but it is one that is difficult to ignore,\u201d he said. Speaking at the Australia-Canada Economic Leadership Forum in Sydney on Wednesday, Lowe said the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy seemed relatively positive, with growth expected to pick up to 3% over the next two years, inflation tipped to rise above 2%, and the unemployment rate likely to remain steady. Australia\u2019s historically low wages growth may also have bottomed, he said, though a pick-up in wages growth did not seem imminent. But Lowe said the ratio of household debt to income was at a record high \u2013 at 189.6% \u2013 and there were signs it was starting to affect spending. \u201cHouseholds are carrying more debt than they have before and, at the same time, they are experiencing slower growth in their nominal incomes than they have for some decades,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many, this is a sobering combination. Reflecting this, our latest forecasts were prepared on the basis that growth in consumption was unlikely to run ahead of growth in household income over the next couple of years. \u201cThis interaction between consumption, saving and borrowing for housing is a significant issue. \u201cWe are still learning how households respond to higher debt levels and lower nominal income growth,\u201d he said. Lowe also defended the rules-based open international trading system, saying Australia had benefited greatly from it. \u201cToo often these days, a commitment to open international trade, integration into global capital markets, a strong role for markets and a dynamic financial sector are seen as liabilities, not as assets,\u201d he said. But he acknowledged that the benefits from the international trading system could fall unevenly across the community. \u201cWe recognise that while openness makes the size of the pie bigger, it can also affect the distribution of the pie in a way that our societies feel uncomfortable with,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that we have both tried to address and have had more success on this front than some other countries.\u201d He also weighed into the house price debate, saying part of the reason house prices were so high in some capital cities was poor planning. He said Canada and Australia were both experiencing challenges on the supply-side, at a time of strong demand from both residents and non-residents. \u201cIn some parts of Australia, there has also been underinvestment in transport infrastructure, which has limited the supply of well-located land at a time when demand for such land has been growing quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is higher prices.\u201d",
