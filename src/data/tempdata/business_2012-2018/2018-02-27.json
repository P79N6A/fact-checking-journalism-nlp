      "bodyText": "More than 5,500 retail jobs are at risk as two of the high street\u2019s best known names teeter on the edge of collapse. Toys R Us, with more than 3,000 staff, is set to go into administration in the next 24 hours, and 11th-hour rescue talks designed to shore up Maplin are also said to have broken down, meaning that the 200-store electronics chain also faces imminent bankruptcy. The loss-making Toys R Us retailer has been hunting for a buyer for several weeks, but the formal appointment of administrators is now imminent. The 105-store chain is a subsidiary of the eponymous US company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada last year after amassing $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debt. The brand, which runs large out-of-town stores, has struggled to keep pace with shifts in shopping habits as Britons increasingly buy toys online or in supermarket aisles. Maplin, which is owned by the private equity investor Rutland Partners, has been struggling to find new funding since last autumn when it lost its credit insurers, which means that suppliers demand cash payment for stock upfront rather than one to three months after delivery. Maplin sales fell by 7% over the Christmas period, partly because the shops were short of stock as a result of its credit insurance problem. Maplin\u2019s problems have reached a critical point because the stores faces a \u00a315m VAT bill, which is due for payment by 1 March. The chain has been in talks with Philip Day, a billionaire retailer whose business interests span Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Peacocks, Jaeger and Austin Reed, but the talks are understood to have broken down on Tuesday afternoon. Many high street names are finding trade tough. House of Fraser is asking its landlords to cut its rent bills, and Debenhams and New Look are trying to cut costs by shutting stores. The major supermarkets have recently announced thousands of job cuts. Large volumes of trade have switched online \u2013 20% of fashion is now bought on the internet \u2013 and a huge shift is under way in the way households spend their time and money. Leisure, travel, eating out, eating in and technology are all taking time and cash that would once have gone to shops. The specialist beds retailer Warren Evans went into administration earlier this month and the fashion chain East collapsed at the end of January. The furniture chain Multiyork and the shoe retailer Shoon both folded in the weeks before Christmas. Retail experts said Toys R Us\u2019s problems were down to a lack of investment in its stores and website. \u201cIt would be easy to blame Amazon, but the reality is that Toys R Us has been a victim of complacency,\u201d said Natalie Berg, an analyst at NBK Retail . \u201cAs a specialist retailer, the Toys R Us experience should have been a magical one with in-store events, dedicated play areas and product demonstrations. The reality was a soulless shed.\u201d The company\u2019s UK chain won a stay of execution in December when landlords agreed to take back the keys to a quarter of its shops and accepted less rent for those that stayed open, but after weak trading in the new year its US owner cut it adrift. The retailer had been trying to drum up a buyer before the end of February when several payments were due. \u201cThe combination of rising prices and subdued demand is putting considerable pressure on retailers and particularly exposing those with underlying issues,\u201d said Berg. \u201cBurdened by debt, Toys R Us has simply been unable to adapt to a changing retail environment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Poor old Rupert Murdoch. A media titan can\u2019t even break up his own empire these days without gatecrashers turning up to spoil the show. Comcast\u2019s \u00a322bn bid for Sky is bold, aggressive and cutely timed \u2013 qualities associated with Murdoch in his pomp \u2013 and, very probably, marks the start of a shootout for the UK satellite broadcaster. The open question is who will to go head to head with Comcast. Should it be Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox, whose current \u00a310.75-a-share cash offer for Sky has been trumped by 16% by Comcast? Or should Disney, in the process of trying to buy the bulk of Fox via a deal that includes the 39% stake in Sky, take matters into its own hands and make a direct counter-offer? Therein lies the cleverness of Comcast\u2019s timing. Brian Roberts, the chairman and chief executive, has a decent chance of exploiting the confusion in the opposition camps. Does Fox, given the importance of the Disney deal, have a completely free hand to raise debt and get into a bidding war for Sky? And does Disney, whatever it says about Sky being a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d, really regard the UK TV company as fundamental to its wider purchase of Fox assets in the US? The very worst outcome for Murdoch would be to lose to Comcast in the battle for Sky and then see his Disney deal scuppered by US regulators, which is still a possibility. In that case, as Jefferies analysts put it, Fox would be left as \u201ca subscale collection of mainly US assets with India as the only material international exposure\u201d. Put another way, in that scenario Murdoch would have been outmanoeuvred in the current frenzy of deal-making in the international media industry. It is why he is highly unlikely to shrug his shoulders and just accept Comcast\u2019s cash for Fox\u2019s current 39% stake in Sky. He will want to stay in this fight. For Sky\u2019s non-Murdoch shareholders, life is working out splendidly. Comcast, as a $184bn US cable giant, is plainly a serious bidder with little regulatory baggage. Critically, it would even be prepared to have majority control of Sky with Fox or Disney as a co-traveller \u2013 it has set the threshold for acceptances at just 50.1%. In the stock market, Sky\u2019s shares shot up to \u00a313.30 on Tuesday morning, anticipating that the bidding will go higher than Comcast\u2019s \u00a312.50 offer. Wind the clock back and shares in Sky, amid worries about competition from Netflix, had slumped to 750p before Fox pounced in December 2016. The long, winding and still-unresolved UK regulatory process has not helped Murdoch\u2019s cause, but he knew the risks. Events happen. Perceptions of Sky\u2019s value have also been boosted by a successful renewal of Premier League rights at a lower price than last time. Everything now points to an almighty two- or three-way scrap for Sky. This cannot be the ending Murdoch expected. He assumed Fox\u2019s 39% stake in Sky meant he was the only possible bidder. He was wrong. Provident taken to the cleaners The directors of Provident Financial, a high-interest-rate lender to \u201cnon-standard\u201d borrowers, now know how it feels to be taken to the cleaners. Their company is paying \u00a331m in underwriting and advisers\u2019 fees to get a \u00a3331m rights issue out of the blocks. Given that the new shares will be issued at 315p, versus a share price that shot up 70% to \u00a310, the underwriting risk is negligible. Investment bankers win again. Provident can have no complaints, however, about the \u00a3169m it will pay in compensation to credit card borrowers in cases where the full price of an add-on product, called a repayment option plan, was not disclosed. For official purposes, the bulk of the sum is being returned voluntarily since it relates to events before 2014, which is when the Financial Conduct Authority took over regulation of consumer credit. In practice, the company had little choice. It was in a hole and the FCA could dictate the price of extraction: full redress for customers, a stronger balance sheet, and a board spouting lines about the need \u201cto rebuild trust with our customers, regulators, shareholders and employees\u201d. The last reference is to Provident\u2019s botched shakeup of its doorstep lending division, the other factor behind profit warnings that have seen the shares crash from \u00a332 last spring. If the new management can avoid similar calamities, which shouldn\u2019t be too hard, Provident clearly has a future. And the FCA is right to let it have a go. Some of the interest rates Provident charges aren\u2019t pretty \u2013 but there are uglier operators out there, not of all of whom respond to a regulatory whip.",

The move comes after a challenging year for the company, which included the company suspending production at its West Bromwich plant for five weeks following a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation that raised questions over the firm\u2019s food standards. The company said that Boparan would become president of 2 Sisters\u2019 holding company, Boparan Holdings, and that it would begin the search for a new head of the food group. Boparan said: \u201cI am fully committed to building a better, more transparent business, modernising our company and simplifying our operations. I want to take a broader industry leadership role and concentrate more on the issues and challenges that affect not only our business, but also the food sector in general such as Brexit, social responsibility and sustainability.\u201d There was no mention of last year\u2019s food standards scandal. Boparan was hauled in front of a parliamentary select committee, in a direct response to Guardian and ITV undercover filming showing workers altering slaughter dates on crates of chickens and reintroducing to the production line poultry which had been dropped on the floor. The Commons\u2019 environment, food and rural affairs committee concluded that the problems identified at the West Bromwich site were \u201cnot a one-off\u201d and said they were \u201cconcerned at the apparent laxity of the oversight\u201d at the plant considering the history of the food processor. The 2 Sisters Food Group said there was an innocent explanation for changing the date labels. Following the hearing in October, the sector has had a series of similar scandals, including the collapse of the meat producer Russell Hume, which slumped into administration this month after meat was prevented from leaving the group\u2019s factories following problems with \u201cmislabelling\u201d at its Birmingham premises. The company\u2019s demise followed the pork firm Fairfax Meadow voluntarily recalling meat products this month after issues with use-by date labelling. Products from DB Foods were also recalled in February after the Food Standards Agency found that \u201cuse-by dates on some products were not compliant with legal requirements\u201d. In February 2 Sisters revealed that 900 jobs were under threat at three of its poultry plants, although it has pledged to create an additional 1,000 roles elsewhere in its business. Following Boparan\u2019s move to the role of president, the chief operating officer at 2 Sisters, Martyn Fletcher, is to run the business in the interim.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A late update: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox have - finally - responded to Comcast\u2019s offer. Fox says: New York, NY, February 27, 2018 - 21st Century Fox (\u201c21CF\u201d) notes the possible offer announcement made by Comcast Corporation (\u201cComcast\u201d) for Sky plc (\u201cSky\u201d). 21CF remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky announced on 15th December 2016. We note that no firm offer has been made by Comcast at this point. A further statement will be made if appropriate. Hints from new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell that there could be four rather than three US rate rises this year have pushed up the dollar and left stock markets flagging. Despite Sky closing 20% higher at \u00a313.31 - above the bid price from US group Comcast - the FTSE 100 ended in negative territory. European markets also ended the day marginally lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 7.13 points or 0.1% lower at 7282.45 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.29% to 12,490.73 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.01% at 5343.93 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB bucked the trend, up 0.08% at 22,724.46 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.02% at 9900.2 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.09%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Republican Claudia Tenney asks about more transparency during the blackout period around meetings. Powell says, I would have to look at what you\u2019re proposing. The blackout gives us a chance to do our thinking and come out and make an announcement, then after a day or two people can make speeches. Generally it\u2019s been seen as a good thing to step away for a period. Democrat Denny Heck asks when America will get a raise, saying 2.9% wage growth is well below historic averages. Powell says, in time wages should grow, but we really need to have more productivity. Republican Barry Loudermilk asks about what the Fed is doing on cyber security to protect its data. Powell says I\u2019m going to put a high priority on it. We\u2019ve done a good job but we can do better. Democrat Joyce Beatty asks if the stock market is an indicator for the economy. Powell says we don\u2019t manage the stock market, it enters into our thinking, it\u2019s not the economy but it plays a factor. Democrat Ruben Kihuen asks what Fed or congress can do to combat wage inequality? Powell says our part is to try and achieve maximum employment, which we are doing. The only way for wages to go up is for productivity to go up, which needs investment. Those are things congress and the administration would be well advised to focus on. Democrat Gwen Moore asks if inflation target should be say 2.5%. Powell says we are committed with a 2% goal, equally concerned about undershoots and overshoots. Moore asks about inequality in the US and brings up the tax reforms again. What concerns does the Fed have about income inequality. Powell says there has been a stagnation of middle class median incomes. We need to have a better trained workforce. Moore asks if we will have this tremendous GDP growth after tax cuts, or will it be under 1%. Powell says the tax bill and budget agreement came after the December meeting. There will be a meaningful increment in demand over next couple of years from these things. I expect wages to increase this year. Rothfus asked why is the inflation target 2%. Powell says it gives us more room for manoeuvre, in terms of cutting interest rates if necessary. It oils the wheels of the economy and gives us more ammunition. It has become the global standard and it would not be difficult for a central bank to move from it. Back on safer ground (probably) Republican Keith Rothfus says, there are four vacancies on Fed, can it fulfill its duties under those circumstances? Powell says he would like vacancies filled, We don\u2019t need all seven [Fed members] immediately but would be good to have more faces on the hall. Here\u2019s a tricky one for Powell. Democrat David Scott says Trump\u2019s tax cuts help just 1%, budget cuts hit the Afro-American poor, there are changes to food stamp system. The Fed should get on our side. Trump is not on side of the American people. Powell hesitates. He says, these are very important issues, i take it to heart, but they are not issues we have authority over. Scott says he was waiting for that. He says, there is no one better suitied. When you sneeze, Wall street tumbles. I know you have a deep compassion for people. You should say, hold on Mr President, this isn\u2019t right. Scotts time runs out before Powell can respond again. Democrat Stephen Lynch asks about whether the Fed is concerned about the risks of exchange traded funds [in the wake of recent market volatility] Powell says, the markets were generally orderly through the volatility, I don\u2019t think etfs were at the heart of what went on. We are talking to other agencies, it\u2019s a question to be looked into. Republican Frank Lucas asks about the outlook for the economy. Powell sayd, it does feel to me the next couple of years will be quite strong, should be good years for the economy and I would think should create a good environment. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: The new Fed chairman appears to have his feet firmly under the desk. Not only has he managed to send the dollar flying higher, unseating GBPUSD and EURUSD in impressive fashion, but he has added to this by boldly stating that QE remains a tool that will firmly remain in the Fed\u2019s armoury. At a time when QE is coming under criticism again, his defence will be taken as a sign that the Fed has not abandoned this powerful weapon, tightening cycle or no tightening cycle. While equities wobbled as the Q&amp;A session developed, investors seem to have warmed to his tone and careful approach. This first date appears to be going well, with markets apparently content that Powell is firmly in the Bernanke/Yellen mould that they know so well, and isn\u2019t about to rock the boat. Democrat Michael Capuano talks about the British ruling on the gender pay gap, and says there was a call for something similar in the US but the Trump administration stopped it. He says that is horrendous and for a fair economy, you need the numbers and the information for getting towards pay equity. Is the Fed interesting in pursuing some degree of investigation of how the financial institutions it oversees pay their employees. Powell says he is not familiar with these rules, this is for Congress. We have a job and we want to stick to that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question for the Fed, it\u2019s for others. Democrat Gregory Meeks asks how much of the corporate tax cuts will go to wages rather than stock buybacks or dividends? Powell says there are estimates out there but we don\u2019t have a Fed estimate of that kind of thing. With the dollar rising and bond yields moving higher, equity markets are heading in the other direction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 78 points or 0.27%. Powell\u2019s comments about the strengthening economy etc suggest he may be thinking of more than three rate rises this year, and the foreign exchange market thinks so, with the dollar gaining ground as he speaks. US bond yields are also rising, on the expectation of further interest rate rises. Carolyn Maloney asks, what would cause you to raise rates more than three times this year? Powell says at the December meeting, the median projection was three rises. There will be another projection in three weeks at the next meeting, but since [December] we have seen an increasing strengthening of the economy, inflation is moving to target, there is growth around the globe and fiscal policy has been more accommodative. He says, We will be reviewing our projections, [for the next meeting] and I would not want to prejudge it. Maloney asks, has the outlook changed in light of the tax reforms and the budget agreement? Powell says, my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December, we\u2019ll be taking into account everything that\u2019s happened since December. Republican Andy Barr says we have seen a wave of bonuses since tax cuts were announced, and will this increase wages? Powell says it is hard to trace through the effects of tax cuts on wages. Lower taxes should lead to higher investment, which should lead to higher productivity, which should lead to higher wages over time. Asked about risks of the unconventional monetary policy, Powell plays this down. He says the financial sector shows modest risk. There are some high asset prices, but no buildup of leverage among households. Following the testimony, the committee chair Hennsarling asks about the 2% inflation target and whether the Fed will move from it or replace the target with a range. Powell says the committee would be concerned about concerted deviation above or below the target. The market understands this. The congress meeting has begun, and a number of senators are having their say before Fed chair Jerome Powell gets to read his testimony. The Republican chair of the financial services committee Jeb Hensarling says there should be a sustainable path to a more normal policy and says the Fed should \u201cstay in its lane.\u201d Democrat Maxine Waters attacks the government\u2019s policies and says it is trying to undermine the Fed. After a few more partisan comments, Powell is up. Following its move on Sky, Comcast shares have lost around 6% in early trading. 21st Century Fox is down 1% while Disney, which is bidding for Fox, has lost 1.9%. Following Jerome Powell\u2019s comments on interest rates and the strength of the US economy, US markets are struggling for direction in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.09%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up just 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite fell by a similar amount. ING Bank however expects four rate rises this year, with the first next month. Economist James Knightley says: Jay Powell\u2019s first testimony before Congress as Fed Chair emphasises continuity from Chair Yellen with a repeat of the policy of gradual rate hikes. Ahead of his testimony there was some speculation that he could adopt a slightly more dovish stance, but the written submission doesn\u2019t back this up. Instead, Powell suggests the economic outlook \u201cremains strong\u201d while stating \u201dsome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds\u201d, namely fiscal policy and foreign demand. He also hints that inflation is likely to rise, repeating Janet Yellen\u2019s position that some of the \u201cshortfall\u201d in inflation likely reflects \u201ctransitory influences that we do not expect will repeat\u201d. He also sounds fairly relaxed about the recent market volatility, saying that despite this, \u201cfinancial conditions remain accommodative\u201d. Moreover, financial conditions are not \u201cweighing heavily\u201d on the economy... As such, the tone of Powell\u2019s written testimony suggests that the Fed position hasn\u2019t really changed under its new leadership with gradual hikes remaining the theme. However, his hints at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response. At the moment the Fed are projecting three rate hikes this year while financial markets are currently pricing in around 80bp of rate hikes. Given our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for 2018 and the potential for inflation to rise more quickly than many in the market anticipate (wages, dollar weakness, medical care costs, cell phone data distortions, commodity prices), we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter \u2013 starting with the March 21 FOMC meeting. Danske Bank reckons three US rate hikes are still on the cards this year: The full text of Powell\u2019s testimony is here. More detail from Powell\u2019s comments, including the expectation of further gradual interest rate rises. But he is not specific about whether that means three or four rises in the rest of the year, something which has been exercising investors: While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory. Despite the recent volatility, financial conditions remain accommodative. At the same time, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. In the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of ... our objectives. As always, the path of monetary policy will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Breaking: The world\u2019s newest and most powerful central bank chief has declared that America\u2019s economic outlook remains strong. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has told the US House Banking Committee that the Fed will \u201cstrike a balance\u201d between the risk of an overheating economy and the need to keep growth on track. Powell\u2019s testimony has been released ahead of his appearance at Congress in under 90 minutes time. Skimming it quickly, I can\u2019t see any major shocks. Powell seem to be sticking to the same position as his predecessor, Janet Yellen; namely, that the recovery is robust, and borrowing costs should rise - in a careful fashion - to keep inflation under control. For example, Powell says: Against this backdrop of solid growth and a strong labor market, inflation has been low and stable. In fact, inflation has continued to run below the 2% that the FOMC judges to be most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate. Insisting that the economic outlook is strong, Powell adds: The robust job market should continue to support growth in household incomes and consumer spending, solid economic growth among our trading partners should lead to further gains in U.S. exports, and upbeat business sentiment and strong sales growth will likely continue to boost business investment. Moreover, fiscal policy is becoming more stimulative. In this environment, we anticipate that inflation on a 12-month basis will move up this year and stabilize around the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective over the medium term. Wages should increase at a faster pace as well. The Committee views the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but will continue to monitor inflation developments closely. You don\u2019t hear the words \u2018poor old Rupert Murdoch\u2019 very often (not since he almost got a pie in the face in 2011, maybe). But our financial editor, Nils Pratley, has summoned up a smidgen of sympathy.... Nils writes: Poor old Rupert Murdoch. A media titan can\u2019t even break up his own empire these days without gate-crashers turning up to spoil the show. Comcast\u2019s \u00a322bn bid for Sky is bold, aggressive and cutely-timed \u2013 qualities associated with Murdoch in his pomp \u2013 and, very probably, marks the start of a shoot-out for the UK satellite broadcaster. The open question is who will to go head-to-head with Comcast. Should it be Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox, whose current \u00a310.75-a-share cash offer for Sky has been trumped by 16% by Comcast? Or should Disney, in the process of trying to buy the bulk of Fox via a deal that includes the 39% stake in Sky, take matters in its own hands and make a direct counter-offer? Therein lies the cleverness of Comcast\u2019s timing. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive, has a decent chance of exploiting confusion in the opposition camps. Does Fox, given the importance of the Disney deal, have a completely free hand to raise debt and get into a bidding war for Sky? And does Disney, whatever it says about Sky being a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d, really regard the UK TV company as fundamental to its wider purchase of Fox assets in the US?. The very worst outcome for Murdoch would be to lose to Comcast in the battle for Sky and then see his Disney deal scuppered by US regulators, which is still a possibility...... More here: Shares in Comcast are down 2% in pre-market trading in New York, following its proposal to acquire Sky in an all-cash deal. Disney shares are also down, around 1%. Wall Street trading begins in 90 minutes.... Newsflash: Sky has issued a statement to the City, urging investors not to take any action following Comcast\u2019s offer to pay \u00a312.50 per share for the broadcaster. Here\u2019s the full statement: The Independent Committee of Sky notes today\u2019s announcement from Comcast regarding a possible all cash offer for Sky at \u00a312.50 per share (the \u201cPossible Offer\u201d). The Independent Directors of Sky are mindful of their fiduciary duties and their obligations under the UK Takeover Code. Since no firm offer has been made at this point, shareholders are advised to take no action. A further announcement will be made as and when appropriate. Another hedge fund, Polygon Global Partners, has predicted a bidding war for Sky - echoing Crispin Odey\u2019s forecast. Polygon portfolio manager Bechara Nasr has told Reuters that Sky could eventually fetch an offer of more than \u00a315 per share (it\u2019s still hovering around \u00a313.30). These hedgies aren\u2019t impartial, of course. Odey Asset Management own 0.9% of Sky\u2019s shares, and Polygon has also held a small stake. It\u2019s not even noon yet, but here\u2019s the Evening Standard\u2019s take on Comcast\u2019s dramatic entry into the Sky takeover story: Here\u2019s my colleague Mark Sweney on today\u2019s Comcast bid: Comcast is attempting to gatecrash Rupert Murdoch\u2019s takeover of Sky, submitting a rival offer to the UK broadcaster\u2019s shareholders worth about \u00a322bn. The media and telecoms company, which owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US, said its all-cash offer of \u00a312.50 per share offered Sky shareholders a 16% premium on the offer from Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox. Fox owns 39% of Sky and submitted its bid to take full control in December 2016, but the deal has been held up by regulatory issues. Comcast has reportedly been exploring a bid for 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets, which include Sky and the 20th Century Fox film studio, since the company agreed a $66bn (\u00a347bn) sale to US rival Disney. The company, which has 1,300 employees in the UK in broadcasting and film and TV production including the firm behind Downton Abbey, promised that Sky\u2019s headquarters would remain at Osterley in south-west London. \u201cComcast intends to use Sky as a platform for growth in Europe. We already have a strong presence in London through our NBC Universal international operations, and we intend to maintain Sky\u2019s UK headquarters,\u201d said the Comcast chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts. \u201cAdding Sky to the Comcast family of businesses will increase our international revenues from 9% to 25% of company revenues. More here: Analysts at investment bank Jefferies have predicted that Disney could actually launch its own bid for Sky soon. That, they say, would resolve the danger that Disney complete its agreement to buy Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox -- but finds that Comcast snaffle Sky first. In a note to clients, Jefferies say that Disney is very keen to acquire Sky - so could offer shareholders a higher price than Comcast: FOX could in principle elect to accept Comcast\u2019s offer. In that event, Comcast has reserved the right to switch from a simple takeover offer (requiring 50% plus 1 share acceptance) to a Scheme of Arrangement (requiring 75% approval of all Sky shareholders, including Murdoch Family Trust as they are not setting up this Scheme). More likely is that FOX will raise its offer well above \u00a312.50, in our view. This would give unaffiliated Sky shareholders an incentive to hold out and see if CMA approval of FOX-Sky is forthcoming. The problem for FOX of merely cashing in its Sky stake is not that this derails DIS-FOX (we understand that there is no exit route for DIS, or no impact on offer value, if Sky assets are sold before DIS takes charge). Instead, the issue for FOX would be that if it sold out of Sky only then to find that DIS-FOX were blocked, FOX would be left as a sub-scale collection of mainly US assets with India as the only material international exposure. Likely DIS [Disney] response, in our view, will be to table a direct offer to Sky shareholders. DIS CEO has described Sky as the \u2018crown jewel\u2019 asset among the FOX operations he is seeking to acquire. Just as with Comcast, adding more international distribution (direct to consumer) and content production is strategic to countering Netflix, Amazon, etc. A counter-bid from DIS would avoid the regulatory complexities/delays in much the same way as the Comcast approach. Rupert Murdoch will be furious that Comcast has gatecrashed his takeover bid for Sky, according to hedge fund chief Crispin Odey. Odey (who was once married to Murdoch\u2019s eldest child, Prudence), told Bloomberg: \u201cThis is tanks on their lawn\u201d. Odey, I imagine, will be cock-a-hoop this morning. He\u2019s been pushing for a higher bid for Sky, arguing that 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid was too low. Sky\u2019s share price is climbing higher, as City traders lick their lips at the prospect of a bidding war. After two hours of trading, Sky\u2019s shares are now up 22% at \u00a313.50, the highest since 2000 - and \u00a31 or 8% above Comcast\u2019s bid. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, says the market \u201cclearly smells the scent of some more action before this saga draws to a close\u201d. \u2018Comcast has gazumped 21st Century Fox with a better takeover offer for Sky shareholders. The successful conclusion of the Premiership football rights auction has moved the dial for Sky, which secured more games at a lower cost than last time around. Indeed the fact that Sky shares were already trading at 30p above Fox\u2019s offer price tells us the market was expecting an improved offer from somewhere. As it is, Comcast has thrown its hat into the ring and is now seeking to meet with the Sky directors to flesh out the deal. There may well be some reaction from 21st Century Fox. However, since the bid for Sky was launched, 21st Century Fox has agreed to sell many of its assets, including Sky, to Disney. It remains to be seen therefore what appetite Rupert Murdoch has to pursue Sky any further. Reuters\u2019 Ben Martin agrees: European-based readers may not be totally au fait with Comcast, but it is undoubtedly a massive player. Valued at around $184bn (or six times more than Sky), Comcast owns the NBC TV network, the Universal Pictures film studio (owner of DreamWorks, and cable firms MSNBC and CNBC, the XFINITY telecoms service, plus several theme parks. It can trace its history back to 1963, when it began as a \u201csingle-system cable operator\u201d in Tupelo, Mississippi. It was founded by Ralph J. Roberts, the father of current chairman and CEO Brian. My colleague Mark Sweney has more info: NBC Universal division has spent more than $1bn on TV and film productions in the UK over the last three years. It owns Carnival Films, the UK production company behind Downton Abbey and The Last Kingdom; Made in Chelsea producer Monkey; and Working Title, the British film producer responsible for Four Weddings and Funeral, Baby Driver and Darkest Hour. NBC Universal also owns cable channels including Syfy and E!. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, has just commented on Comcast\u2019s bid for Sky. He argues that Comcast must pledge to fund Sky News for at least 10 years (as Rupert Murdoch pledged last week). Watson says: \u201cThe UK\u2019s media plurality and Sky\u2019s high broadcasting standards are at stake in this bidding process. All bids including this new one from Comcast must be very carefully scrutinised. \u201cComcast must demonstrate its commitment to plurality by guaranteeing a properly funded Sky News for at least a decade as a key condition of the sale.\u201d As flagged up earlier, Comcast have already promised to \u201cmaintain Sky News\u2019 existing brand and culture\u201d and its track record of excellence and impartiality. There\u2019s no time-scale on that commitment, though.... In a fantastic twist, Comcast\u2019s chief Brian Roberts says a London taxi driver played a key role in triggering today\u2019s bid: Readers are split over the merits of Comcast\u2019s offer for Sky. Here\u2019s some reaction from below the line... Oh... and if Comcast could send an engineer round to Cobberthedog\u2019s patch, we\u2019d be most grateful.... Neil Campling of Mirabaud Securities says it makes a lot of sense for Comcast to acquire Sky: There is the attraction of diversifying away from the U.S. because of pressures on the cable industry there. The regular annuity stream that you have from the subscription business of Sky will be of primary appeal to Comcast. \u201cThe strategic fit of Sky for Comcast makes sense. Comcast has grown to become the number 1 cable company in the US so the company has a strong background in Pay-TV. Also Comcast has a large international operation through content of its NBCU assets and has previously stated interest in expanding the non-US asset base. Comcast EV (enterprise value) is $247bn so this is an easily absorbed deal. He also believes that Comcast is acting now, because Sky has just retained rights to show Premier League football, and before the UK regulators give their approval to Fox\u2019s bid. Sky\u2019s shares have hit their highest levels in almost 18 years, dating back to the end of the dot-com boom: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here are the key points from Comcast\u2019s surprise $31bn offer for Sky: Possible all-cash offer of \u00a312.50 per share, premium of 16% to the current 21 Century Fox offer Minimum acceptance condition of 50 per cent. plus one share Confident in receiving all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner Strategic opportunity to acquire a leading content and distribution business in the UK and Europe Specific intentions to maintain a strong presence in the UK for the combined business: Continued investment in creative industries in the UK Support for high broadcasting standards and news impartiality in the UK The combined business will have the resources and capabilities across content, technology and service to compete and grow in a rapidly changing market Accretive to Comcast\u2019s free cash flow per share in year one Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says that Comcast\u2019s proposed offer for Sky is a \u201cfascinating development\u201d, on many levels. The deal would have attractions on a number of fronts, not least of which would be the removal of complexity from the current tripartite discussions between Fox, Disney and Sky. In a land where, increasingly, content is king, there would be synergies from a creative programming perspective, whilst the potential showstopper of media plurality concerns would probably not apply to the Comcast bid. Meanwhile, the combined group would have a stable of media, production and technology outlets which would position it strongly in any number of countries. Hunter also points out that Murdoch\u2019s 39% stake in Sky is an added complication: In a normal takeover situation, the potential acquirer would be extremely keen to have the support of the largest shareholder in an effort to ease the deal through. Unlikely though it seems, this could yet happen, but it is equally plausible that Fox will need to return with an improved bid, which the market was beginning to anticipate in any event. Indeed, the initial share price reaction suggests that this story has further to run, with Sky\u2019s price leaping above the level of the already increased Comcast offer. Whatever the outcome, Comcast has put the cat amongst the pigeons with a move which should make for compulsive viewing.\u201d Here\u2019s more reaction to the Comcast deal, first from journalist Robin Powell: City veteran David Buik says the ball is firmly in 21st Century Fox\u2019s court - will Murdoch boost his own bid, or accept Comcast\u2019s offer? CNBC\u2019s Geoff Cutmore flags up that we could get a full-blown bidding war for Sky Boom! Shares in Sky have jumped by 18% at the start of trading. They have surged to \u00a313.10, up from \u00a311.05 last night. That actually values Sky at more than Comcast\u2019s new proposal (\u00a312.50 per share), suggesting that the City believes Murdoch may have to increase his own offer (\u00a310.75). Some quotes from Comcast are flashing up on my Reuters terminal now. Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts are saying that there are \u201cstrong strategic benefits\u201d in combining its assets with Sky. The company didn\u2019t speak to Sky until this morning, and hasn\u2019t had any contact with the Murdoch family since Fox announced its deal to sell assets to Disney. Roberts also says Comcast is prepared to be co-owners of Sky with either 21st Century Fox, or Disney. [That could happen, if Comcast buy the 61% of Sky which 21C Fox doesn\u2019t own, and Disney completes the existing deal to buy Fox]. Sky\u2019s shares are likely to surge when trading begins on the London stock market in 10 minutes. They closed at \u00a311.05 last night - ahead of 21st Century Fox\u2019s offer (\u00a310.75), but well short of Comcast\u2019s offer of \u00a312.50. The news that Comcast could take control of Sky is sending shockwaves through the media sector. The FT\u2019s Arash Massoudi agrees that it could disrupt Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bid, and even scupper his grand plan to sell much of his Fox empire to Disney: City analyst Louise Cooper says the deal has been triggered by pressure from new media. She suspects Comcast will have to fight hard to get the deal over the line. Comcast says it doesn\u2019t expect to run into any of the \u2018media plurality\u2019 concerns that have dogged Rupert Murdoch\u2019s attempts to buy Sky. Today\u2019s statement includes a section called \u201cSupporting high broadcasting standards and news impartiality in the UK\u201d, which states: Comcast recognises that Sky News is an invaluable part of the UK news landscape and the Company intends to maintain Sky News\u2019 existing brand and culture, as well as its strong track record for high-quality impartial news and adherence to broadcasting standards. While Comcast does own a substantial international operation in the UK, with more than 1,300 employees, the Company has only a minimal presence in the UK media market. Comcast therefore does not believe that this Superior Cash Proposal should create any media plurality concerns in the UK. Comcast is also pledging to use keep Sky\u2019s headquarters in the UK, if its takeover bid succeeds. Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts says: \u201cComcast intends to use Sky as a platform for growth in Europe. We already have a strong presence in London through our NBCUniversal international operations, and we intend to maintain Sky\u2019s UK headquarters. Adding Sky to the Comcast family of businesses will increase our international revenues from 9% to 25% of Company revenues.\u201d NEWSFLASH: Comcast, the US cable company, has launched a takeover offer for Sky, in a challenge to Rupert Murdoch. Comcast is offering to pay \u00a312.50 per share in cash for the British broadcaster, valuing it at $31bn, or \u00a322.1bn. This is a 16% premium to the existing takeover bid from 21st Century Fox (\u00a310.75 per share). Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, says \u201cWe think Sky is an outstanding company\u201d, adding: \u201cIt has 23m customers, leading positions in the UK, Italy and Germany, and is a consistent innovator in its use of technology to deliver its customers a great experience.\u201d That bid has been caught up in regulatory concerns -- last month, the Competition and Markets Authority ruled that it was not in the public interest for Fox to buy the 61% of Sky it doesn\u2019t own, due to media plurality concerns. There\u2019s an additional complication -- since bidding for Sky, Murdoch has agreed a deal to sell much of Fox\u2019s assets to Disney. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Jerome Powell\u2019s big day. The world\u2019s most powerful central banker testifies to Congress, for the first time since replacing Janet Yellen as head of the Federal Reserve. Investors around the world will be watching closely, for hints about how quickly the Fed might raise interest rates if inflation picks up. Worries about rising borrowing costs caused the markets to plunge at the start of this month; traders will be worried about a repeat. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Although yields have fallen away from their recent 4 year high, there is still a level of caution among investors over the future of the US economy and monetary policy, which is keeping the market on edge. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the most relevant event today will be new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s appearance before Congress, in the Semi-annual Monetary Policy Report. This is his first official testimony in a highly anticipated event. However, given the backdrop of interest rate expectation sensitivity, which caused significant market disruption, Powell is unlikely to want to rock the boat. We also get new economic data from the eurozone, including the first estimate of inflation in Germany. The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer confidence figures 1pm GMT: German inflation figures 1.30pm GMT: Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony to the House Banking Committee is released 3pm GMT: Powell\u2019s session before the House Banking Committee begins",

Economist James Knightley says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Jay Powell\u2019s first testimony before Congress as Fed Chair emphasises continuity from Chair Yellen with a repeat of the policy of gradual rate hikes. Ahead of his testimony there was some speculation that he could adopt a slightly more dovish stance, but the written submission doesn\u2019t back this up. Instead, Powell suggests the economic outlook \u201cremains strong\u201d while stating \u201dsome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds\u201d, namely fiscal policy and foreign demand.</p> <p>He also hints that inflation is likely to rise, repeating Janet Yellen\u2019s position that some of the \u201cshortfall\u201d in inflation likely reflects \u201ctransitory influences that we do not expect will repeat\u201d. He also sounds fairly relaxed about the recent market volatility, saying that despite this, \u201cfinancial conditions remain accommodative\u201d. Moreover, financial conditions are not \u201cweighing heavily\u201d on the economy...</p> <p>As such, the tone of Powell\u2019s written testimony suggests that the Fed position hasn\u2019t really changed under its new leadership with gradual hikes remaining the theme. However, his hints at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response. At the moment the Fed are projecting three rate hikes this year while financial markets are currently pricing in around 80bp of rate hikes. Given our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for 2018 and the potential for inflation to rise more quickly than many in the market anticipate (wages, dollar weakness, medical care costs, cell phone data distortions, commodity prices), we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter \u2013 starting with the March 21 FOMC meeting. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a956679e4b038071a9b32cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-27T14:09:01.963Z\">2.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hamrickisms/status/968487595394072576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell very consistent with what predecessor Janet Yellen might have delivered.

In this environment, we anticipate that inflation on a 12-month basis will move up this year and stabilize around the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective over the medium term.

The problem for FOX of merely cashing in its Sky stake is not that this derails DIS-FOX (we understand that there is no exit route for DIS, or no impact on offer value, if Sky assets are sold before DIS takes charge). Instead, the issue for FOX would be that if it sold out of Sky only then to find that DIS-FOX were blocked, FOX would be left as a sub-scale collection of mainly US assets with India as the only material international exposure.</p> <p><strong>Likely DIS [Disney] response, in our view, will be to table a direct offer to Sky shareholders.</strong> DIS CEO has described Sky as the \u2018crown jewel\u2019 asset among the FOX operations he is seeking to acquire. Just as with Comcast, adding more international distribution (direct to consumer) and content production is strategic to countering Netflix, Amazon, etc. A counter-bid from DIS would avoid the regulatory complexities/delays in much the same way as the Comcast approach.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a9531c0e4b038071a9b307d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-27T10:31:40.150Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rupert Murdoch will be furious that Comcast has gatecrashed his takeover bid for Sky, according to hedge fund chief Crispin Odey.</strong></p> <p>Odey (who was once married to Murdoch\u2019s eldest child, Prudence), told Bloomberg:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThis is tanks on their lawn\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>Odey, I imagine, will be cock-a-hoop this morning. <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-sky-m-a-fox-odey/odey-adds-to-sky-disquiet-following-disneys-deal-with-fox-idUKKBN1EC1QZ\">He\u2019s been pushing for a higher bid for Sky, arguing that 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid was too low</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a952ddae4b08e3dd30f5874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-27T10:18:06.347Z\">10.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sky\u2019s share price is climbing higher, as City traders lick their lips at the prospect of a bidding war.</strong></p> <p>After two hours of trading, Sky\u2019s shares are now up 22% at \u00a313.50, the highest since 2000 - and \u00a31 or 8% above Comcast\u2019s bid.<br></p> <p><strong>Laith Khalaf, </strong>senior analyst at financial services group<strong> Hargreaves Lansdown</strong>, says the market \u201cclearly smells the scent of some more action before this saga draws to a close\u201d. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2018Comcast has gazumped 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox with a better takeover offer for Sky shareholders. </p> <p>The successful conclusion of the Premiership football rights auction has moved the dial for Sky, which secured more games at a lower cost than last time around.

In a land where, increasingly, content is king, there would be synergies from a creative programming perspective, whilst the potential showstopper of media plurality concerns would probably not apply to the Comcast bid. Meanwhile, the combined group would have a stable of media, production and technology outlets which would position it strongly in any number of countries.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hunter also points out that Murdoch\u2019s 39% stake in Sky is an added complication: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a normal takeover situation, the potential acquirer would be extremely keen to have the support of the largest shareholder in an effort to ease the deal through. Unlikely though it seems, this could yet happen, but it is equally plausible that Fox will need to return with an improved bid, which the market was beginning to anticipate in any event. Indeed, the initial share price reaction suggests that this story has further to run, with Sky\u2019s price leaping above the level of the already increased Comcast offer.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, Comcast has put the cat amongst the pigeons with a move which should make for compulsive viewing.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a951360e4b05fe61cc6d48e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-27T08:20:12.035Z\">8.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s more reaction to the Comcast deal, first from journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobinJPowell\">Robin Powell</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobinJPowell/status/968398471475511296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My former colleagues at Sky News will be relieved to hear that Comcast is committed to keeping it.

      "bodyText": "Consumers have been warned to brace for a new round of energy price rises within weeks because suppliers are under pressure to pass on increases in wholesale costs. Bulb, one of the fastest-growing small suppliers, said on Tuesday it would be putting up its dual fuel electricity and gas tariff by \u00a324 a year to \u00a3879 for a typical annual bill. The increase would have been \u00a363 if not for measures the firm had implemented. Hayden Wood, the company\u2019s co-founder, said it had seen wholesale costs rise by 11% since last July. \u201cWhen wholesale energy costs move, so does our tariff,\u201d he said. The move will affect 300,000 customers. Industry sources and analysts said they expect bigger players to break ranks shortly and announce price rises for millions of households. An energy executive said they expected rivals could increase prices by up to 9%, which would add about \u00a3100 to the average big six standard variable tariff of \u00a31,135. Others expect the figure to be more like \u00a350. Energy regulator Ofgem will publish an update on the costs facing energy suppliers on Wednesday. An industry source said they expected it to show a 5% to 6.5% increase based on rising wholesale prices and other costs, including clean energy subsidies paid through bills. Announcing the decision last month, the regulator said wholesale costs of gas and electricity this summer would be up \u00a317 to \u00a3378 compared with last year, while government environmental and social policy costs would be up \u00a310 to \u00a3135. Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Bernstein bank, said: \u201cI think people will use the pre-payment meter cap [increase] as the reason [for hiking other tariffs]. I don\u2019t see why people would not raise their prices.\u201d She said she would be surprised if British Gas was first to break cover, saying it was more likely to be EDF, E.ON, npower or ScottishPower. Robert Buckley, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s very hard for them to suck up prices of this magnitude for a long period of time.\u201d He said that with the government introducing legislation in parliament this week for a price cap for 11m households by next winter, the political stakes were very high for companies considering an increase. \u201cIf you do move, you\u2019re not going to get a very good reaction,\u201d he said. Freezing temperatures this week have driven up within-day wholesale gas prices by more than a quarter to 82.50p per therm as millions of people fire up their boilers. That will be felt more keenly by small suppliers, unlike the big players who hedge far ahead. Several industry sources said it was possible the weather had delayed announcements, because no one wants to be seen putting up tariffs while it was so cold. The previous round of price rises started with EDF in December 2016, followed by npower in February 2017 and three of the other big six suppliers shortly after. A senior energy figure said firms were in a \u201cMexican stand-off\u201d, watching each other to see who would go first this time. Industry watchers said the move by Ofgem to hike the price cap for vulnerable people would provide some cover for firms, who could point to the regulator\u2019s decision. Utilita has also sent out letters this week warning of a price rise from 1 April. The price rise is \u00a341 a year for Utilita\u2019s 620,000 customers, 99% of whom are covered by the Ofgem cap for vulnerable customers. New figures have also revealed the big six\u2019s dominance of the energy market is weakening. According to Ofgem, small and medium challenger suppliers now supply 21% of electricity customers and 22% of gas customers, up from 16% for gas and electricity at the end of 2016. Dermot Nolan, the regulator\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe largest suppliers are under pressure as more consumers switch away to small- and medium-sized suppliers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US economy \u201cremains strong\u201d, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, told Congress on Tuesday as he signaled the central bank is on course to carry on gradually increasing interest rates in the coming months. In his first congressional testimony since his appointment, Powell painted an upbeat picture of the country\u2019s economic health and dismissed recent wobbles in the stock market. \u201cSome of the headwinds the US economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,\u201d said Powell. He told Congress his \u201cpersonal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December\u201d. Powell managed to avoid controversy \u2013 one of the key aims of the Fed chair \u2013 ably deflecting politically charged questions about the US\u2019s huge debts, the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s recently announced $1.5tn tax cuts and income inequality. US stock markets barely moved during his testimony. The Fed is expected to raise rates three times this year. \u201cFurther gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment\u201d of the Fed\u2019s objectives of achieving full employment and controlling inflation, said Powell. The rebound in the US jobs market which has continued uninterrupted for a record seven years finally seems to be lifting wages in the US after a long period of stagnation. That news led to sharp sells-offs in stock markets that have broken records since Donald Trump\u2019s election as investors bet the Fed would hike interest rates more quickly in order to dampen fears of rising inflation. Powell said that while assets were \u201chigh\u201d he had no real concerns about systemic risks in the US economy at present. The Fed \u201cwill continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy\u201d and allowing inflation to rise to the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2%, Powell said. Powell\u2019s testimony is the first from a Fed chairman since the passage of Trump\u2019s tax cuts programme. The cuts have been cited as the impetus for bonuses at companies including American Airlines, AT&amp;T and Disney. But critics have pointed out that bonuses are not the same as wage rises and that the tax benefits to corporations dwarf the size of the benefits to individuals. Asked if the tax cuts had led to wage rises Powell said it was \u201cvery hard to trace through\u201d the effects of tax policy. Asked how much of the tax cuts would go to share buybacks and dividends as against onetime bonuses and raises, he replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t have estimates of that kind of thing.\u201d Powell, a former investment banker for the Carlyle Group and longtime member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors under his predecessor Janet Yellen, was sworn in on 5 February as the Federal Reserve\u2019s 16th chair.",

He told Congress his \u201cpersonal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December\u201d.</p> <p>Powell managed to avoid controversy \u2013 one of the key aims of the Fed chair \u2013 ably deflecting politically charged questions about the US\u2019s huge debts, the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s recently announced $1.5tn tax cuts and income inequality. US stock markets barely moved during his testimony.<br></p> <p>The Fed is expected to raise rates three times this year. \u201cFurther gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment\u201d of the Fed\u2019s objectives of achieving full employment and controlling inflation, said Powell.</p> <p>The rebound in the US jobs market which has continued uninterrupted for a record seven years finally seems to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-job-numbers-and-wage-growth-are-up-but-inequality-is-also-on-the-rise\">lifting wages</a> in the US after a long period of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/08/us-jobs-market-economy-not-so-rosy\">stagnation. </a></p> <p>That news led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/07/donald-trump-says-stock-market-is-making-a-big-mistake-after-drop\">sharp sells-offs</a> in stock markets that have broken records since Donald Trump\u2019s election as investors bet the Fed would hike interest rates more quickly in order to dampen fears of rising inflation.</p> <p>Powell said that while assets were \u201chigh\u201d he had no real concerns about systemic risks in the US economy at present. </p> <p>The Fed \u201cwill continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy\u201d and allowing inflation to rise to the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2%, Powell said.</p> <p>Powell\u2019s testimony is the first from a Fed chairman since the passage of Trump\u2019s tax cuts programme. The cuts have been cited as the impetus for bonuses at companies including American Airlines, AT&amp;T and Disney.</p> <p>But critics have pointed out that bonuses are not the same as wage rises and that the tax benefits to corporations dwarf the size of the benefits to individuals.<br></p> <p>Asked if the tax cuts had led to wage rises Powell said it was \u201cvery hard to trace through\u201d the effects of tax policy. Asked how much of the tax cuts would go to share buybacks and dividends as against onetime bonuses and raises, he replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t have estimates of that kind of thing.\u201d</p> <p>Powell, a former investment banker for the Carlyle Group and longtime member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors under his predecessor Janet Yellen, was sworn in on 5 February as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/02/jay-powell-federal-reserve-janet-yellen\">Federal Reserve\u2019s 16th chair.</a></p>",

It is also one of the reasons why the sector has so few women in top jobs today, because of a lack of candidates rising from the middle ranks, the Treasury select committee heard on Tuesday. Anne Richards, the chief executive of M&amp;G Investments, said part of the problem ahead of the financial crisis was that key decisions were made by one homogeneous group. \u201cIf you look back at the crisis, it\u2019s because those teams all looked exactly like each other, they were all alpha male, and as a result groupthink took hold and bad stuff happened. \u201cIt\u2019s not about saying one particular group are bad or evil, it\u2019s about how you get the blend of skills so you get balance in decision-making and problem-solving.\u201d Richards said there was a fall in the number of women wanting to join the financial industry in the wake of the crisis, with female applicants for graduate jobs dropping to one in 10. \u201cThe perverse consequence of 2008 is I believe we did see first of all a drop off in female applicants to the industry. \u201cWe did appear across financial services to lose a disproportionate number of women immediately post crisis at a middle management layer, which is one of the reasons now at the more senior levels we\u2019re all finding it difficult to find enough women to get us to parity in our leadership teams.\u201d Richards said M&amp;G had worked to encourage more female graduate applicants and had raised the proportion to about a third. She appeared before the committee alongside Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of Axa UK, and Susan Allen, the head of retail distribution at Santander UK, as part of the inquiry into women in finance, launched last October to try to identify the barriers to women entering and progressing in the financial services industry. Blanc said that although there was a will across the industry to improve female representation in top roles, she was nervous that it would take too long. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of energy. The danger is that it doesn\u2019t actually achieve what we want it to achieve,\u201d she said. The three executives conceded the gender pay gap within the financial services industry was unacceptably high but said the reason for this was the dominance of men in senior roles. The median pay gap for full-time roles in the sector was 31% in the year to April 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics.",

Researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research think they might have found a new way to spot recessions early, based on a long-running truism that birthrates fall during recessions. They have gone one step earlier and looked at conception rates instead, and found these drop several months before any other signs of a recession \u2013 meaning we might have a new way to see them coming. However, as a sign no indicator is perfect, the US conception rate appeared to drop sharply late in 2014, with no corresponding recession having followed \u2013 yet. It\u2019s not the first attempt to find a nontraditional way to spot recessions \u2013 here are a few others. The hemline index This disputed measure was first proposed in 1926, and suggests that the hemline of women\u2019s skirts inch their way up (into miniskirts) during economic boom times, and become longer during recessions. More recent evidence has suggested that while there is an effect here, skirt length only changes a few years after the economic cycle \u2013 making it pretty useless for prediction. The skyscraper index Proposed \u2013 tongue firmly in cheek \u2013 by Barclays, this index posits that the construction of a new world\u2019s tallest building heralds the coming of a recession; a pleasing theory to those who think recessions follow periods of irrational excitement with too much money flowing to grand projects. In its favour, this index has the completion of the Chrysler building and Empire State Building during the great depression, but more scientific analysis has not been so supportive. The \u201cR-word\u201d index This unusual win for media accuracy comes courtesy of the Economist, which checked the simple observation that when financial newspapers start talking about recessions \u2013 the \u201cr-word\u201d \u2013 one usually follows. They\u2019re not usually very well ahead of the curve, but if you spot that spike, bad times may be ahead. The coupon index This one is quite neat: sites tracking the redemption rate of online coupons might help to show the start of a recession \u2013 as it\u2019s a good sign that consumers are starting to watch the pennies, which doesn\u2019t bode well for confidence. That said, there was a big spike in coupon redemption late in 2012, which wasn\u2019t followed by a downturn. The divorce index There are two competing arguments about what recessions do to divorce rates: one is that because they make us miserable, we split up more. The other is that because divorces are expensive, people delay them during recessions. The evidence is on the side of the latter: during the last recession, divorces fell in both the US and the UK\u2013 so if couples start staying together, even that could be bad news.

      "bodyText": "The big six energy suppliers would be wise to heed the advice of business secretary Greg Clark on Monday: accept that a price cap has support in parliament, so don\u2019t do anything silly like launch a judicial review. Better to implement the cap in time for next winter without further complaint. Yet, if Clark is dishing out advice, the person who could use some guidance is Dermot Nolan, chief executive of regulator Ofgem, who has the unenviable job of setting the level of the cap. At best, he is being sent mixed messages by government. At worst, he is be asked to deliver contradictory goals. The big idea is to abolish \u201crip-off\u201d default tariffs, as the prime minister puts it, but Nolan is also being told to preserve competition between suppliers and maintain incentives for customers to switch. If he opts for a cap on the high side, incentives to switch would remain intact but \u201crip off\u201d prices would be only be curbed at the edges. If Nolan goes low, suppliers might respond by setting all their tariffs at the cap, or thereabouts, which wouldn\u2019t meet anybody\u2019s definition of a competitive market; all tariffs would be more or less the same, with active switchers penalised. Two further demands complicate Ofgem\u2019s task. Creating \u201cincentives for suppliers to improve efficiency\u201d might suggest a low cap, to force companies to cut costs and shed staff, as British Gas announced last week. On the other hand, \u201cthe need to ensure that efficient suppliers are able to finance their supply activities\u201d could be an argument for leaving fat in the system to ensure money flows into new generating capacity. The City \u2013 understandably \u2013 expects a grand fudge. Analysts guess that the cap to be set at about \u00a31,050 for an average dual-fuel household, or about \u00a3100 below the current highest standard variable tariffs (SVT). That would allow Theresa May to boast about delivering a saving she has mentioned in the past. But the figure would apply only to a minority of the 11m households on SVTs, those currently paying top whack. If so, the price cap won\u2019t end the debate. The next row will be about whether the companies have been left off the hook. The big energy suppliers, to be clear, have brought this position on themselves by gouging their inattentive customers for years. But the price cap policy is still messy: ministers haven\u2019t defined success in terms that can be understood easily. Heaven help Ofgem when, come 2020, it must decide whether it is safe to remove the cap and revert to today\u2019s system. The basis on which the regulator is supposed to make its recommendation is as clear as mud. Online rises could force Hammerson to lower rents \u201cNot all retail is equal and not all locations are well placed to support the future needs of brands,\u201d says David Atkins, chief executive of Hammerson, before unleashing a relentlessly upbeat assessment of why his group\u2019s shopping centres are in the winners\u2019 camp. Occupancy stands at a 17-year high of 98.3% and earnings per share improved 6.5% last year. Fine, so why do shares in Hammerson, owner of the Brent Cross and Birmingham Bullring centres among many others, stand at a discount of 40% to net asset value? The answer emerges when only you look beyond Atkins\u2019 cheerful take and see what\u2019s happening of the ground. Retail sales at UK centres declined 2.7% in 2017, more than twice the rate of the previous year. The rise and rise of internet shopping is biting. Even in France, where Hammerson says online shopping is less advanced, sales were merely flat. Hammerson is still squeezing out rental increases, but you wonder for how much longer. Atkins\u2019 idea that large shopping centres \u201cinteract seamlessly with digital\u201d sounds like wishful thinking. Yes, there is interaction in that traditional retailers still want stores to display products, even to customers who end up by buying online. But the process probably won\u2019t be seamless. If in-store sales are falling, retailers will eventually demand lower rents. That is why one reason why Hammerson\u2019s shares have fallen by a third in three years. It is also why the group\u2019s proposed \u00a33bn takeover of Intu, owner of Lakeside in Essex and the Metrocentre in Gateshead, is best viewed as a deeply defensive deal \u2013 a case of two retail property specialists huddling together in search of safety. There has been little protection so far: Hammerson\u2019s shares are down 13% since the deal was unveiled in December and exit from the FTSE 100 index looms. Funnily enough, Atkins didn\u2019t mention that.",

The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: \u201cMr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. \u201cThe discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. \u201cI have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week\u2019s] report.\u201d The bank has so far paid \u00a31m in claims to GRG\u2019s victims, and expects that to rise to \u00a35m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: \u201cThere remains a substantial sum of money \u2013 up to \u00a3280m \u2013 within RBS\u2019s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. \u201cMr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn\u2019t be marking its own homework.\u201d Last week\u2019s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was \u201cendemic\u201d and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses.

      "bodyText": "A senior Carillion \u201cwhistleblower\u201d, who later became the group\u2019s finance boss, struggled to get her concerns about accounting irregularities within the company taken seriously in the run-up to its demise, it has emerged. Emma Mercer raised questions last spring over the company\u2019s accounting practices to the group\u2019s human resources department six weeks into her new role as finance chief of Carillion\u2019s construction services. Carillion folded in January with just \u00a329m in cash on its balance sheet. Mercer approached the HR unit after she was dissatisfied with explanations given to her by the then chief executive, Richard Howson, or the then finance director, Zafar Khan, on problems with the accounting on major Carillion projects. Those projects included the redevelopment of Battersea power station in London and the construction of the new Royal Liverpool hospital. When directors discussed Mercer\u2019s concerns at a board meeting in May 2017, the Carillion non-executive director Alison Horner noted that \u201cMrs Mercer appeared to be a whistleblower who did not feel she was listened to\u201d. In September 2017 Mercer became the Carillion finance director after replacing Khan, who had only been in post for just over a year. The board also said it would launch a part-independent investigation into why the errors had not been picked up by the auditors KPMG but later opted to exclude any independent oversight. The latest revelations are contained in copies of Carillion\u2019s board minutes from May last year, which were released on Monday by the the joint parliamentary select committee investigating the construction group\u2019s collapse. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the work and pensions select committee, said: \u201cEmma Mercer took just six weeks to spot and pull the thread that began the entire company unravelling. That the next chief financial officer had to go through whistleblowing procedures to get her concerns about accounting irregularities taken seriously by the Carillion board is extraordinary. So too is that the board\u2019s response was to reject an independent review and get KPMG ... to mark their own homework.\u201d Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, added: \u201cCarillion directors say they couldn\u2019t foresee what investors and company staff could \u2013 that spiralling debt problems and failing contracts were destined to sink the company. These board minutes point to a very different scenario \u2013 Emma Mercer was sounding the alarm but none of the Carillion directors were willing to wake up and listen.\u201d The issues Mercer identified revolved around Carillion allegedly using refunds it expected to receive from subcontractors to lower the amount it reported owing other firms in its annual accounts. After investigating the errors, the KPMG partner Peter Meehan is quoted in the minutes as concluding that the company\u2019s financial results did not need to be restated and that \u201che did not believe that there was an intent to deceive, but rather [it] was due to incompetence, negligence or sloppy accounting\u201d. In testimony before MPs on two select committees this month, Howson had said the company\u2019s problems crystallised after KPMG reviewed its contracts in spring 2017, leading to write downs of \u00a3845m and a profit warning that began the company\u2019s death spiral. However, one former Carillion executive who has spent most of his career with the company told the Guardian last week that major problems were apparent long before that but were kept \u201con the back burner\u201d. The board minutes added: \u201c[Finance chief Khan\u2019s] view was that there had been incompetence and laziness in the accounting review of the contract and in recognising the position.\u201d A spokesman for KPMG, who said the accountants had not seen the board minutes released by the joint committees, said: \u201cAs we have already commented, we believe that we conducted our role as Carillion\u2019s auditor appropriately and responsibly.\u201d",

The board also said it would launch a part-independent investigation into why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/29/kpmg-carillion-frc\">errors had not been picked up by the auditors KPMG</a> but later opted to exclude any independent oversight.</p> \n<p>The latest revelations are contained in copies of Carillion\u2019s board minutes from May last year, which were released on Monday by the the joint parliamentary select committee investigating the construction group\u2019s collapse. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a978a7bbe1c7af650e068d5035830b967d56cd68\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a978a7bbe1c7af650e068d5035830b967d56cd68/1013_192_1740_1045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Mercer and Zafar Khan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Mercer had been dissatisfied with explanations given to her by Carillion\u2019s then-finance director Zafar Khan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the work and pensions select committee, said: \u201cEmma Mercer took just six weeks to spot and pull the thread that began the entire company unravelling. That the next chief financial officer had to go through whistleblowing procedures to get her concerns about accounting irregularities taken seriously by the Carillion board is extraordinary. So too is that the board\u2019s response was to reject an independent review and get KPMG ... to mark their own homework.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, added: \u201cCarillion directors say they couldn\u2019t foresee what investors and company staff could \u2013 that spiralling debt problems and failing contracts were destined to sink the company. These board minutes point to a very different scenario \u2013 Emma Mercer was sounding the alarm but none of the Carillion directors were willing to wake up and listen.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>The issues Mercer identified revolved around Carillion allegedly using refunds it expected to receive from subcontractors to lower the amount it reported owing other firms in its annual accounts.<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d5e7f303-db04-4283-b095-c2f490e251f5\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Carillion relied on major contracts, some of which proved much less lucrative than it thought.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year it slashed the value of them by \u00a3845m, of which \u00a3375m related to major public-private partnerships (PPPs) such as Royal Liverpool University hospital.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>As its contracts underperformed, its debts soared to \u00a3900m.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The company needed a \u00a3300m cash injection, but the banks that lent it money refused to put more in.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The government also refused to step in and bail the firm out.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>That left the company unable to continue trading and forced it to go into liquidation.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After investigating the errors, the KPMG partner Peter Meehan is quoted in the minutes as concluding that the company\u2019s financial results did not need to be restated and that \u201che did not believe that there was an intent to deceive, but rather [it] was due to incompetence, negligence or sloppy accounting\u201d.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/carillion-director-mp-executives-collapse\">testimony before MPs on two select committees</a> this month, Howson had said the company\u2019s problems crystallised after KPMG reviewed its contracts in spring 2017, leading to write downs of \u00a3845m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/10/carillion-boss-richard-howson-steps-down-shares-crash\">and a profit warning</a> that began the company\u2019s death spiral.</p> \n<p>However, one former Carillion executive who has spent most of his career with the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/21/carillion-was-in-trouble-by-mid-2016-says-whistleblower\">told the Guardian last week</a> that major problems were apparent long before that but were kept \u201con the back burner\u201d.</p> \n<p>The board minutes added: \u201c[Finance chief Khan\u2019s] view was that there had been incompetence and laziness in the accounting review of the contract and in recognising the position.\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokesman for KPMG, who said the accountants had not seen the board minutes released by the joint committees, said: \u201cAs we have already commented, we believe that we conducted our role as Carillion\u2019s auditor appropriately and responsibly.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "CO2 emissions from the average new car sold in the UK rose last year for the first time since 2000, according to an industry report, raising fears that the country will fail to meet its climate change targets as consumers buy bigger vehicles and turn against diesel. Although motor manufacturers said new models coming on to the market were on average about 12% more fuel-efficient than their older versions, campaigners said a higher proportion of gas-guzzling vehicles leaving the forecourt had led to a 0.8% increase in the average amount of C02 generated per new car. Falling consumer confidence has affected the lower end of the car market, with sales of the smallest, cheapest vehicle down by more than 10%. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said an \u201canti-diesel agenda\u201d was contributing to the rise in CO2 emissions. Diesel registrations fell by 17% last year after the emissions scandals. Diesel engines have tended to have greater fuel efficiency than petrol engines, but have been responsible for a rapid rise in NOx emissions and severe air pollution in urban areas. The SMMT said the decline in diesel would make it harder for the UK to hit its CO2 reduction targets. Its report acknowledged that cheaper running costs may have encouraged committed diesel drivers to buy bigger models, noting: \u201cConsumers appear to have often used the improved efficiency of the products to enable them to move into larger and higher value vehicles.\u201d Greg Archer, of the cleaner transport campaign group Transport &amp; Environment, said: \u201cThe principal reason CO2 emissions are rising is that carmakers are selling more gas-guzzling SUVs. Blaming the slump in diesel sales is a smokescreen that hide their failure to fit fuel efficiency technologies to the new cars they are selling.\u201d The SMMT said sales of electric cars were disappointing and thatlong-term incentives would be needed to achieve cuts in CO2 emissions of almost 6% a year until 2021 under EU requirements. The industry said confusion over government policy was causing buyers to hold back, particularly tax changes that took effect last April and more announced in the autumn budget. Despite long-term hopes for electric and hybrid vehicles, 95% of the UK\u2019s 2.5m new cars sold were still either petrol or diesel. Average emissions for a new car rose to 121.0g of CO2 per kilometre, which was the same as 2015 levels. However, the levels were 33% lower than those in 2000. Estimates of CO2 emissions of the average new car are likely to be 20% higher from September 2018, when tests designed to better reflect normal driving comes into force. Total CO2 emissions from all cars in use on UK roads are down just 7% since 2000, according to the SMMT report. This is despite the gradual replacement of vehicles with more efficient models. Emissions have risen over the last three years owing to increased traffic on UK roads. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: \u201cThe industry shares government\u2019s vision of a low-carbon future and is investing to get us there \u2013 but we can\u2019t do it overnight; nor can we do it alone. The anti-diesel agenda has set back progress on climate change, while electric vehicle demand remains disappointingly low amid consumer concerns around charging infrastructure availability and affordability. \u201cTo accelerate fleet renewal, motorists must have the confidence to invest in the cleanest cars for their needs \u2013 however they are powered. A consistent approach to incentives and tax, and greater investment in charging infrastructure will be critical.\u201d Sales of new cars declined by 5.7% last year after five years of growth, with plunging diesel sales after the government signalled tax changes on company cars and cities considered punitive measures to tackle air quality after the VW diesel test-rigging scandal.",
