      "bodyText": "The federal government has ignored warnings that a regulatory void is allowing so-called \u201cdebt vultures\u201d to operate unchecked, consumer advocates say. It has been 18 months since the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) warned that debt management firms were engaging in misleading or, in some cases, predatory conduct. The firms offer to help often-vulnerable individuals manage their debts, usually by stopping calls from creditors or \u201ccleaning up\u201d their credit reports. But Asic found they often charged hidden fees and costs, used high-pressure sales techniques and had a poor understanding of their legal requirements. Australia, unlike Britain, lacked a proper regulatory regime to govern the behaviour of debt management services, Asic warned. Shortly after the Asic report, consumer advocates and others sent a communique to the Coalition, calling for the regulation of the sector. Consumer Action Law Centre policy officer, Cat Newton, said they had yet to receive a response. \u201cWe are still waiting for state and federal consumer affairs ministers to implement a new regulatory framework for debt management firms,\u201d Newton said. \u201cIn the meantime, the 2 million Australians experiencing high financial stress continue to be easy pickings for these debt vultures.\u201d The opposition is also urging the government to properly regulate the sector. On Friday the shadow financial services minister, Katy Gallagher, said the lack of consumer protections was \u201cleaving people exposed to financial abuse\u201d. \u201cAt the moment these firms are largely unregulated, despite them selling services to some of the most vulnerable people in the community,\u201d Gallagher said in a speech in Melbourne. \u201cDebt management firms currently live in a regulatory void \u2013 they\u2019re not regulated as financial advisers nor are they regulated under the consumer credit framework.\u201d \u201cIn a sense they operate in the financial services equivalent of no-man\u2019s land and it\u2019s time this changed.\u201d The UK has a licensing regime for debt management firms, which includes conduct and disclosure obligations. In the US, they are subject to regulation of their conduct, including prohibitions against unfair or deceptive conduct. Some US states enforce rules against the telemarketing of debt relief services. Australian debt management companies are only subject to the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act and general consumer law. \u201cThese predatory companies are flourishing in a regulatory void,\u201d Newton said. \u201cFinancial counsellors and community legal centres have been cleaning up the mess left by these debt vultures for years.\u201d Consumer affairs ministers are meeting late next month and Newton wants to see a commitment to reforms made at the meeting. Labor wants the sector subject to the oversight of a planned new financial services ombudsman scheme. It also wants laws compelling companies to inform consumers of free alternatives to their products. \u201cFailure to respond here will leave vulnerable customers open to financial abuse,\u201d Gallagher said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three months before the start of the biggest financial crisis since the Wall Street Crash, the International Monetary Fund confidently predicted that the world economy looked \u201cwell set\u201d for robust growth in 2007 and 2008. Sure, there were risks, said the IMF, but these seemed less threatening in April 2007 than six months previously. The IMF was not, of course, the only organisation that failed to spot economic armageddon coming \u2013 merely the one with the highest number of PhDs on the books. But if the fund\u2019s patchy past record means all its forecasts should be treated with caution, its growth downgrade for the UK looks perfectly reasonable. Official data for the state of the British economy in the first three months of this year were not available in April when the fund produced its half-yearly World Economic Outlook, but it assumed something stronger than the 0.2% expansion that was eventually announced. Even if the second, third and fourth quarters live up to the IMF\u2019s expectations, the weaker first quarter arithmetically feeds through into growth for 2017 as a whole of 1.7% rather than 2%. Although Wednesday\u2019s first estimate of second-quarter growth will show an improvement on the first quarter, it is clear that the UK economy was not going gangbusters in spring either. It looks likely that the UK posted growth of 0.3% or 0.4%, suggesting that the economy expanded at an annualised rate of 1% in the first half of 2017. A further IMF downgrade to about 1.5% in the autumn looks probable unless the stronger growth the IMF sees in the eurozone and the bigger emerging markets is sustained and leads to higher demand for UK exports. The IMF thinks the global economy is on the up, but is still hedging its bets. It is concerned that China is sustaining growth through a credit bubble. It is worried about Donald Trump launching a trade war. It fears that overvalued financial markets could be heading for a fall. Such caution is perhaps a decade too late, but understandable. The IMF has no desire to be caught with its trousers down a second time. LE EasyJet and Ryanair brought down to earth So much for the idea that easyJet and Ryanair, after a tricky 2016, were about to enjoy sunny trading conditions this year. That theory has been running for months, which is why the loss of altitude in share prices since last Thursday has been severe. EasyJet\u2019s shares have lost a 10th of their value and Ryanair\u2019s 5%. Monday\u2019s culprit was the Irish carrier\u2019s warning that the market remains \u201cvery competitive\u201d and fares are still falling. A similar tale was heard at easyJet last week. The group upgraded its profit forecast for the year after a strong Easter, but reported \u201ccontinuing high market growth\u201d in capacity, especially in Spain and Portugal, putting pressure on prices. In one sense, this development is not surprising. It is easier for smaller rivals to buy new aircraft and add new routes when fuel prices are low. Nor does this year\u2019s experience dent the wisdom of easyJet and Ryanair adding capacity themselves; they\u2019re market leaders and, if they see a long-term opportunity on a new route, they should chase it. But both easyJet and Ryanair may have been guilty of over-hyping the thought that rivals can\u2019t live with the pace they\u2019re setting. All that talk about rivals that struggle with \u201chigh cost bases\u201d and \u201cinadequate financial resources\u201d \u2013 two lines from easyJet\u2019s full-year results last autumn \u2013 now ring a little hollow. Thankfully for flyers, those rivals are still capable of being irritating by surviving. NP AstraZeneca chief should have scotched speculation \u201cNothing can break the momentum you have established, and certainly not rumours,\u201d said AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot in a \u201cDear all\u201d email to staff at the end of last week. No doubt the dispatch improved spirits, as well as the share price, but it pointedly avoided the central question of whether Soriot held discussions about joining Israeli outfit Teva Pharmaceuticals. He\u2019s clearly staying at AstraZeneca, but the quickest way to kill the gossip outright would be state that the Teva tale was 100% nonsense. Soriot will get another chance on Thursday, when he fields questions on AstraZeneca\u2019s half-year results. A clear answer would be preferable to the elaborate argument that commenting on speculation can create \u201cdownstream consquences that may be difficult to manage\u201d. Not commenting also has consequences: staff assume the boss\u2019s head was turned, even if only briefly. NP",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England warns of complacency over big rise in personal debt", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has told banks, credit card companies and car loan providers that they risk fresh action against reckless lending as it warned of a looming \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d about mounting consumer debt. In its toughest warning yet about the possibility of a rerun of the financial crisis that devastated the economy 10 years ago, Threadneedle Street admitted it was alarmed about the increase in the amount of money being borrowed on easy terms over the past year. \u201cHousehold debt \u2013 like most things that are good in moderation \u2013 can be dangerous in excess\u201d, Alex Brazier, the Bank director for financial stability, said in a speech in Liverpool. \u201cDangerous to borrowers, lenders and, most importantly from our perspective, everyone else in the economy.\u201d Brazier\u2019s said there were \u201cclassic signs\u201d of lenders thinking the risks were lower following a prolonged period of good economic performance and low losses on loans. The first signs of the Bank\u2019s anxiety about consumer debt came from its governor, Mark Carney, a month ago, but Brazier\u2019s comments marked a ratcheting up of Threadneedle Street\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cLenders have been the lucky beneficiaries of the benign way the economy has evolved. In expanding the supply of credit, they may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of credit cards and loans in benign conditions,\u201d Brazier said. The willingness of consumers to take on more debt to fund their spending helped the economy grow strongly in the six months after the EU referendum, a period when the Bank expected growth to fall sharply. Over the past year, Brazier said, household incomes had grown by just 1.5% but outstanding car loans, credit card balances and personal loans had risen by 10%. He added that terms and conditions on credit cards and personal loans had become easier. The average advertised length of 0% credit card balance transfers had doubled to close to 30 months, while advertised interest rates on \u00a310,000 personal loans had fallen from 8% to around 3.8%, even though official interest rates had barely changed. The past decade has seen the number of cars bought with a personal contract purchase (PCP) plan \u2013 under which the car is effectively leased \u2013 increase from one in five to four in five. Companies risk losing money if used car prices fall and Brazier said banks involved and the shareholders of car companies would \u201cwant to think very carefully about the risks\u201d. He added that developments in mortgage debt had been much less striking than those in consumer debt and car finance, with lending for home loans up by just 3% over the past year. \u201cBut even here there are some tentative signs of boundaries being pushed,\u201d he said. Strong competition for business was resulting in more lending at higher loan-to-income (LTI) multiples, with the share at an LTI above 4 increasing from 19% to 26% over the past two years. \u201cLenders have not entered, but they may be dicing with the spiral of complacency,\u201d Brazier said, noting that as credit became cheaper it was taken up more widely and was serviced more easily. \u201cThe spiral continues, and borrowers rack up more and more debt. Lending standards can go from responsible to reckless very quickly. The sorry fact is that as lenders think the risks they face are falling, the risks they \u2013 and the wider economy \u2013 face are actually growing,\u201d Brazier said. The Bank director said banks and building societies were being supervised and had to prove to the regulator that they had safeguards in place against entering the spiral of complacency. Lenders were also being regularly stress tested to ensure that they could deal with very severe recessions without cutting back on their lending. In addition, the Bank had forced lenders to hold more capital in order to make them more resilient to losses on their loans. \u201cBy September we will have assessed whether the rapid growth has created any gap in the line. If it has, we\u2019ll plug it,\u201d Brazier said.

Lending standards can go from responsible to reckless very quickly.

      "bodyText": "Batteries and renewable power sources are on the verge of bringing about an \u201cepochal transformation\u201d of the UK that could make energy clean, abundant and very cheap, according to a cabinet minister. As the government unveiled plans for a more flexible energy system and \u00a3246m of funding for battery research, Greg Clark told the Guardian that a smarter grid would \u201cradically\u201d bring down bills. \u201cEnergy, for the last 100 years, for good reasons, we\u2019ve rationed the consumption of [because] it\u2019s been very expensive and environmentally-damaging to consume fossil fuels. [But] given the possibilities we are on the cusp of at the moment, we might move to a world where energy is clean and abundant,\u201d said the business secretary. Storing intermittent renewable power in batteries so it was ready when the grid needed it would bring down costs for everyone, including vulnerable and low income energy consumers, he said. \u201cIf only we can capture it [power from the sun and wind] then we can go from energy being a worrying cost to people, to being, if not free, then very cheap,\u201d Clark said, speaking in Birmingham on Monday as he put energy at the centre of the government\u2019s industrial strategy. Renewables have grown from almost nothing a decade ago to supplying more than a quarter of the UK\u2019s power today, and are expected to increase their share further as costs fall and reach subsidy-free levels. But the variable nature of wind and solar power generation means that local energy networks and the National Grid need more flexibility to cope with those fluctuations. Batteries, and the ability for energy firms to automatically reduce electricity demand from willing businesses and households, are at the heart of a plan published by government and Ofgem. Ofgem said using technology to flatten out peak demand and avoiding the cost for reinforcements to energy networks would save consumers \u00a317bn-\u00a340bn by 2050. The regulator said that the 29 changes to energy regulation announced on Monday, which will come in over the next 18 months, would also encourage new, tech-savvy entrants into the energy market. Andrew Burgess, an associate partner at Ofgem, pointed to emerging smart appliances that could automatically turn down electricity use at peak times, and make it possible for companies to aggregate the solar power from householders\u2019 rooftops and sell it to local power grids when needed. The changes should also make it easier for companies to aggregate and trade services from people who have fitted solar panels or batteries at home \u2013 selling households\u2019 electricity to power grids at times of need. \u201cFor individual consumers, I think the opportunities are for businesses coming in, for the Amazons and Netflixes of the world coming into a traditional sector and offering different ways for consumers to engage,\u201d Burgess said. The smart grid plans came as ministers launched the Faraday Challenge, pledging \u00a3246m of funding for battery research, \u00a345m of which will be used to create a national battery institute,which will be a virtual grouping of universities across the UK. \u201cIts work will quite literally power the automotive and energy revolution, where the UK is already leading the world,\u201d said Clark. He added that the national battery centre would be a fitting way to mark the 150th anniversary of the death of Michael Faraday, the scientist who undertook groundbreaking work on electricity. The energy industry, carmarkers and green groups welcomed the push on smart grids and batteries. Phil Sheppard, National Grid\u2019s head of network strategy, which already runs schemes where businesses are paid to turn down electricity consumption when demand peaks, said: \u201cToday\u2019s report provides clear direction on how we move to a secure, low carbon, flexible energy system, using efficiency and innovation to help keep costs down for bill payers.\u201d WWF said the moves would accelerate the rollout of renewables and electric cars. Gareth Redmond-King, the group\u2019s head of energy, said: \u201cBattery storage is a clear game-changer in our ability to produce clean power from renewables.\u201d Nissan, which makes the batteries for its leaf electric car in Sunderland, said the government plans, combined with having more cars plugged into the grid, would have \u201ca fundamental impact on the shift from fossil fuels to renewables\u201d. But some industry watchers said that while the changes were necessary, they risked creating a two-tier energy system of haves and have-nots, if adequate protections were not put in place. Jon Ferris of Utilitywise said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcements will be transformational for the energy sector, but are not a panacea for the challenges of maximising energy productivity and accommodating increasing renewable generation. \u201cSome domestic consumers may save money, but there is a risk that only consumers able to afford new appliances, solar photovoltaics and storage will benefit.\u201d However, Clark was adamant that the plans would reduce rather than increase inequality in the energy market. \u201c[There] should not be a class of people who are excluded from these possibilities on the way to a big, abundant future,\u201d he said, adding he would make it clear to energy suppliers that they had an obligation to help vulnerable customers access new technology.",

      "bodyText": "Another day of thrills and spills is over in the City, and 1% has been wiped off the value of the biggest firms lister in London: Greek bonds rallied today after news of the new debt sale and buyback hit the wires. This has been welcomed by politicians in Athens, as our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Senior members in the governing Syriza expressed satisfaction at reaction of markets to the news of Athens\u2019 prospective foray. Marking the 43rd anniversary of the restoration of democracy to Greece following the collapse of military rule, prime minister Alexis Tsipras highlighted the optimism saying: \u201c[it] coincides with the decisive restitution of economic stability and the recovery of the country. Now it is the responsibility of all of us to not repeat the mistakes of the past but to build a new Greece.\u201d It\u2019s not been a great day in the City for shares. The FTSE 100 index is down 86 points, or 1.1% at 7365 points, with most stocks losing ground. The news that the International Monetary Fund had downgraded Britain\u2019s growth forecast this morning weighed on the market. Consumer-focused companies, such as Next, were among the fallers. Exporters also suffered from the recent recovery in the pound, which gained 0.25% to $1.3026 today. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE was consistently the market\u2019s worse performer this Monday, dropping nearly 90 points to plunge back below 7400. There were multiple reasons for the index\u2019s decline, from the IMF cutting the UK\u2019s 2017 growth forecasts, to sterling\u2019s rebound and notable losses from the likes of easyJet, Next and Reckitt Benckiser. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story about Greece\u2019s plan to issue fresh bonds for the first time in three years. Here\u2019s the latest from Athens: Another newsflash from America, but this one is less encouraging. The number of home sales slumped by 1.8% in June, suggesting the housing market may be cooling. The annual rate of existing home sales dropped to 5.52m, down from 5.62m in June, and lower than Wall Street expected. Newsflash! America\u2019s private sector is growing at its fastest pace since January US companies are expanding in July, thanks to a boom in new orders that is driving employment up. That\u2019s according to Markit\u2019s latest healthcheck on US manufacturing and service sector companies, just released. Markit\u2019s flash US composite output index has hit 54.2 in July, up from 53.9 in June. That\u2019s a six-month high; any reading over 50 shows growth. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the figures show America\u2019s economy is gaining momentum, but it\u2019s not exactly racing. \u201cThe overall rate of expansion remains modest rather than impressive. The surveys are historically consistent with annualized GDP growth of approximately 2%, but the signs are that growth could accelerate further in coming months. \u201cMost encouraging was an upturn in new order inflows to the second-highest seen over the past two years, which helped push the rate of job creation to the highest so far this year, indicative of non-farm payrolls growing at a rate of around 200,000. \u201cThe principal weak spot in the economy remained exports, with foreign goods orders dropping \u2013 albeit only marginally \u2013 for the first time since last September, often blamed on the strength of th Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence believes this bond sale is meant to give Alexis Tsipras some respite from political pressures back home. He writes: The government of Prime Minister Alexi Tsipras is pushing ahead with a bond issue. This is part of an attempt to gain some breathing space amid domestic political problems. The government would like to raise around \u20ac4bn; the bond is a switch and tender offer for a \u20ac3bn euro-bond issued by the Samaras government in 2014, which matures in April 2019. Athens will also issue new euro-denominated fixed rate notes due in 2022 for cash. The related tender process will take place on 25 July. Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party have fallen behind in the polls, with the right-leaning New Democracy opening up a substantial lead.... Greece\u2019s new foray back into the financial markets will play a big role in setting the mood ahead of its expiry of its \u20ac86bn bailout next year. If it attracts strong interest from investors it will play a crucial role in quashing suggestions that the debt-stricken country requires a new credit line, or fourth bailout, at that time to keep default at bay. Instead, those who think a clean exit possible will be strengthened. That was quick! Yanis Varoufakis has hit back at Alexis Tsipras\u2019s criticism over his tenure as finance minister. In a letter to the Guardian, Varoufakis says: Either I was the right choice to spearhead the \u201ccollision\u201d with the troika of Greece\u2019s lenders because my plans were convincing, or my plans were not convincing and, thus, I was the wrong choice as his first finance minister. Arguing, as Mr Tsipras does, that I was both the right choice for the initial confrontation and that my plan B was so vague it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble of even talking about is disingenuous, albeit insightful, for it reveals the impossibility of maintaining a radical critique of his predecessors while adopting the Tina (There Is No Alternative) doctrine. More here: Greece\u2019s prime minister set the scene for this week\u2019s debt sale by telling the Guardian that the worst of the debt crisis was now over. In an interview with my colleague Helena Smith published today, Alexis Tsipras declared that: \u201cWe can now say with certainty that the economy is on the up \u2026 Slowly, slowly, what nobody believed could happen, will happen. We will extract the country from the crisis \u2026 and in the end that will be judged.\u201d This interview has caused waves in Greece, where almost the entire media have reproducing excerpts -- including Tsipras\u2019s concession that he made \u201cbig mistakes\u201d since wining power in January 2015. Other highlights include the leftist leader\u2019s dismissal of his former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 Plan B, the contingency programme the self-declared \u201cerratic Marxist\u201d had prepared in the event of debt-stricken Greece being ejected from the euro. Tsipras broke his silence about Varoufakis\u2019s scheme, labelling it \u201cweak and ineffective.\u201d \u201cPerhaps the moment will come when certain truths are told ... when we got to the point of reading what he presented as his plan B it was so vague, it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble of even talking about,.... It was simply weak and ineffective.\u201d In terms of reaction watch this space! This chart shows how Greek bond yields have receded from their crisis-era heights, as confidence has slowly returned. Greece\u2019s offer to buy back some of its existing five-year bonds is good news for investors. Anyone who bought the debt last year, when they traded below their face value, can now sell them back for a profit: The Greek finance ministry has set a goal of a 4.2% interest rate on the bond, reports Helena Smith in Athens. But banking sources believe that will be hard to achieve and say an interest rate of between 4.3% to 4.5% is much more likely. Valuation will take place Tuesday 25th July, our sources add. The test exit is crucial to Greece not only testing markets, from which it has been essentially exiled since the start of its great economic crisis, but weaning itself off borrowed bailout funds. Why is Greece launching a new bond sale now? One reason is that Greek bonds have been strengthening in recent weeks, showing that investors believe the risk of default has fallen. Reuters\u2019 Alice Gledhill explains: The \u20ac4bn 4.75% 2019 bonds have been trading at a record low yield, bid below 3.5% according to Thomson Reuters prices, making it an opportune time for the country to issue its first deal since 2014.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: As well as issuing new bonds, Greece is inviting investors who hold its existing five-year bonds to redeem them. Those bonds expire in 2019, but Athens is prepared to swap them for cash now. Here\u2019s the details: The full official announcement is online here. Breaking news from Athens! Greece\u2019s government is returning to the financial markets for the first time since 2014. Six banks have been hired to bring new five-year bonds to the markets, two years after Greece nearly plunged out of the eurozone altogether. Reuters has the details: The Hellenic Republic, rated Caa2/B-/CCC/CCCH, has mandated BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and HSBC as joint lead managers for a five-year euro bond, according to a lead. The issue is subject to market conditions and the results of a concurrent switch and tender offer. Greece will be speaking to investors this afternoon, so we should get more details about how much it hopes to borrow, and on what terms. If the sale it successful, it could help Greece to exit its long cycle of austerity and rescue packages. Late last Friday, S&amp;P upgraded its outlook on Greek government debt from stable to \u201cpositive\u201d, partly thanks to hopes that Greece\u2019s creditors could finally grant it debt relief. Today\u2019s move comes two weeks after we reported in this blog that the Greek government was planning to return to the markets this summer. The interest rates on Greek bonds has fallen away from their levels at the height of the crisis, fuelling hopes that it could fund itself without the help of painful bailouts. The IMF\u2019s downgrade growth forecasts have caused a stir in Westminster this morning. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has just issued a statement, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s report from the IMF is yet another blow for the Government and its continued austerity agenda that is holding our country back. \u201cIt further reveals that this government has no real plan for Brexit and no real plan to deal with the problem of earnings not keeping up with prices, which is undermining growth and risking living standards. \u201cOnly a Labour government will end austerity and provide the vital programme of investment to boost growth in our economy, underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule, which our country desperately needs. And this is from Heidi Alexander MP, leading supporter of Open Britain: \u201cThese figures underline how the uncertainty and loss of confidence caused by the Brexit vote is hampering our economy. If the Government persists with its plan for a hard and destructive Brexit, our growth figures are likely to get even worse. \u201cLeaving the largest trading bloc in the world for an inferior deal will not be offset by the illusory promise of quick new trade deals with other countries around the world. The result will be less trade that leaves us all poorer. \u201cTo support our economy and protect jobs, the best deal for Britain will be for us to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union, thus continuing to enjoy totally free trade with the world\u2019s biggest market on our doorstep.\u201d Have you ever popped a new bag of crisps open, only to find it contains more air than deliciously fried potato? Or found yourself curiously peckish after wolfing down your favourite chocolate bar? If so, you\u2019ve fallen victim to shrinkflation - the practice where manufacturers quietly cut their product sizes without changing the price. In a new report, the Office for National Statistics shows that more than 2,500 products have shrunk in size over the past five years but prices have stayed the same. Food and drink are particularly vulnerable, perhaps because they are vulnerable to fluctuating commodity costs. The ONS says we can\u2019t blame it on Brexit, though; this phenomenon has existed for a long time. Today\u2019s report explains: Weight changes occur most often in food products rather than any other item category. There are also consistently more reductions across both the food category and non-food items. However, despite some media speculation, there has not been a change in trend since the EU referendum \u2013 our data shows that shrinkflation has been used in practice consistently across the past 5 years. Consumer journalist Harry Wallop has been tweeting some particularly egregious examples: However, the ONS reckons shrinkflation doesn\u2019t actually undermine its inflation data, as it tracks these changes and adjusts its data accordingly. The IMF\u2019s new forecasts highlight the dangers posed by the Brexit talks, says Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments. He writes: \u201cWith the IMF\u2019s growth forecast for the UK cut from 2% to 1.7% for the year, this means there is again a focus on the debate about the effect of Brexit on the country\u2019s business. While the IMF\u2019s downgrade has been based on \u2018tepid performance\u2019, the ultimate impact of Brexit continues to remain unclear. The key factor which threatens to derail the economy and significantly reduce market confidence is the potential for either the Brexit talks collapsing or reaching stalemate. At the moment, there appears to be negligible progress on the talks and the IMF certainly would have factored the risk of talks stalling in reducing their economic growth forecast.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy reminder of today\u2019s IMF forecast changes: A wave of anxiety is sweeping through Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 index has shed 64 points or 0.9% to 7388. EasyJet is one of the big fallers, down 3%, after rival budget airline Ryanair announced plans for price cuts this summer. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: The FTSE has suffered a rude awakening to the new week, with the gains of last week clearly left in the rear-view mirror. One of the biggest drags we have seen has come from the airline sector, with Ryanair\u2019s warning of a potential air fare war in the coming months leading to sharp falls for easyJet and IAG, the owner of airlines including British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus. This morning the IMF cut its growth forecast for the UK for the first time since the EU referendum over a year ago. Chief amongst its concerns is the tepid economic performance seen in the first quarter of 2017, with the enactment of Article 50 coinciding with a deterioration in both business and consumer confidence. European markets are also in the red. Germany\u2019s DAX has shed 0.5%, dragged by car companies such as Volkswagen and Daimler. That follows reports that the German auto industry colluded in a \u201csecret technology cartel\u201d for the past 20 years. UK businesses should heed the IMF\u2019s warning that Britain\u2019s economy is weakening, says Markus Kuger, Senior Economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet: \u201cThe IMF\u2019s downgrade reflects the undercurrent of political and economic uncertainty in the UK, as the impact of Brexit on the economy remains unclear. The first quarter of the year saw a mediocre economic performance and Dun &amp; Bradstreet rates the level of risk in the UK as \u2018deteriorating\u2019. The slow progress of Brexit negotiations is creating considerable unpredictability for businesses operating in and with the UK. This has only been intensified by the results of the general election in June, as the government\u2019s narrow parliamentary majority is further complicating the process of leaving the EU. \u201cThe best advice for businesses is to closely monitor the economic climate and the progress of EU negotiations, and use the latest data and analytics to assess risk and identify potential opportunities. As Brexit negotiations progress organisations should get a clearer picture of the future, but until then careful management of relationships with suppliers, customers, prospects and partners will be key to navigating through these uncertain times.\u201d The International Monetary Fund\u2019s new growth forecasts are getting plenty of coverage this morning. The Financial Times reports that the Fund expects the \u201cbroadest synchronised upswing\u201d in a decade. Better growth in China, the euro zone and Japan is making up for a slower-than-expected US economy and Donald Trump\u2019s stalled economic promises as well as a faltering UK, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday. In its latest update, the IMF left its April forecasts for 3.5 per cent global growth this year and 3.6 per cent next year unchanged. But the lack of change in the world\u2019s headline growth masked what the IMF said was a rotation in the sources of growth. Sky News flag up that the UK has been downgraded, while Europe\u2019s recovery looks to be gathering pace: The International Monetary Fund has lowered its growth forecast for the UK to 1.7% for 2017. The organisation said a weaker than expected performance meant it was revising expectations from the 2% it predicted in April. The US also had its economic forecast downgraded to 2.1% from 2.3%. It comes in contrast to major European countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, where growth exceeded expectations. Germany has been revised up by 0.2 points to 1.8%, France by 0.1 points to 1.5%, while Italy and Spain have both been revised up by 0.5 points to 1.3% and 3.1% respectively. Reuters sums up the global picture: The International Monetary Fund kept its growth forecasts for the world economy unchanged for this year and next, although it revised up growth expectations for the eurozone and China. In an updated World Economic Outlook published on Monday, the IMF said global gross domestic product would grow 3.5 percent in 2017 and 3.6 percent in 2018, unchanged from estimates issued in April. \u201cWhile risks around the global growth forecast appear broadly balanced in the near term, they remain skewed to the downside over the medium term,\u201d the IMF said in updated forecasts released in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. But...forecasts are made to be missed. Steve Hawkes of The Sun reminds us that the IMF predicted Britain would plunge into recession if it voted to leave the EU..... Ranko Berich of Monex Europe is refreshingly sceptical about the IMF\u2019s crystal ball..... Here\u2019s Julien Lafargue, European Equities Strategist at JP Morgan, on today\u2019s eurozone PMI reports: Following one of the best quarters in the past six years, a slowdown in the Eurozone\u2019s pace of expansion was to be expected. Yet, economies in the region continue to grow strongly, and the details of today\u2019s survey point to a continuation of this trend in the coming months. Encouragingly, the recent strength of the Euro does not appear to be cited as a concern at this point with new export order growth in Germany\u2019s goods producing sector accelerating slightly in July. If sustained, the Euro\u2019s appreciation may represent a headwind. However, at this stage, we believe it is not enough to derail the recovery in the region and we would expect the ECB to prevent further appreciation if it comes to a point where it jeopardizes the region\u2019s economic momentum. That appreciation has continued this morning, with the euro hitting a two-year high. Breaking: Companies across the eurozone are continuing to expand robustly, although growth has dipped to a six-month low. That\u2019s according to Markit\u2019s latest healthcheck on the euro area, including this morning\u2019s figures from France and Germany. Manufacturing firms led the way, with strong order book growth, rising backlogs and healthy job creation during this month. However... the figures are a little weaker than in the spring. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the data suggests Europe is still growing strongly (echoing the IMF\u2019s upbeat comments this morning). \u201cThe July fall in the PMI indicates that the eurozone\u2019s recent growth spurt lost momentum for a second successive month, but still remained impressive. \u201cThe survey data are historically consistent with GDP rising at a quarterly rate of 0.6%, cooling slightly from a pace of over 0.7% signalled for the second quarter. \u201cThe slowing pace of economic growth signalled by the surveys and the accompanying easing of price pressures adds to the belief that ECB policymakers will be in no rush to taper policy, and will leave all options open until the central bank sees a clearer picture of the sustainability of the upturn. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to know for sure whether the economy has merely hit a speed bump or whether the upturn is already starting to fade. The evidence so far points to the former, with the economy hitting bottlenecks due to the speed of the recent upturn. \u201cForward-looking indicators such as new order inflows remain elevated, suggesting robust growth will be sustained in coming months. Job creation is consequently booming as companies seek to expand capacity in line with growing demand. Germany\u2019s \u2018flash PMIs\u2019 have just been released, and they suggest private sector growth has hit a six-month low. Manufacturing and service sector companies in Europe\u2019s largest economy reported that activity rose at a slower rate this month. This pulled the \u2018Flash Germany Composite Output Index\u2019 down to 55.1 in July, down from 56.4 in June. That suggests Germany\u2019s private sector is growing that the slowest rate since January, after a very strong start to 2017. So what changed this month? Well, Germany companies report that growth in manufacturing output and total new orders slowed this month, even though there is still \u201chigh demand\u201d from customers in both Europe and Asia. Trevor Balchin, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, believes Germany is still enjoying \u201cstrong underlying growth\u201d. The easing seen in July follows the strongest quarter in six years, and manufacturing continued to expand at a historically sharp rate. New export order growth in the goods- producing sector accelerated slightly and suppliers remained under substantial pressure. Boom! France\u2019s factories are enjoying their best month since 2011, thanks to a surge in new orders. That\u2019s according to the latest French PMI report from Markit, just released. Markit found that manufacturing output accelerated to its fastest rate in 75 months, jumping to 55.4 in July from 54.8 in June. Service sector growth slowed a little, sending the services PMI down to 55.9 from 56.9. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this indicates that the French economy is still growing strongly. French companies reported that new business picked up strongly this month, creating larger backlogs of work and encouraging them to take on more staff. Annabel Fiddes, Economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cSteep increases in output and employment were key takeaways from the latest release, with manufacturing firms noting the quickest rise in staff numbers for nearly 17 years. \u201cFurther increases in total new orders and backlogs suggest that companies will continue to ramp up output and add to payrolls going forward, and marks a solid start to the second half of the year.\u201d Despite cutting its UK and US growth forecasts, the IMF still thinks the global recovery is \u2018firming\u2019. That\u2019s because it revised up its growth expectations for the eurozone to 1.9% this year, up from 1.7% in April. For China, the IMF expects stronger growth of 6.7% in 2017, up 0.1 percentage point. Japan\u2019s growth forecast this year has also been raised, from 1.2% to 1.3%. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the Fund says: Growth has been revised up for Japan and especially the euro area, where positive surprises to activity in late 2016 and early 2017 point to solid momentum. China\u2019s growth projections have also been revised up, reflecting a strong first quarter of 2017 and expectations of continued fiscal support. Inflation in advanced economies remains subdued and generally below targets; it has also been declining in several emerging economies, such as Brazil, India, and Russia.... Growth projections for 2017 have been revised up for many euro area countries, including France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, where growth for the first quarter of 2017 was generally above expectations. This, together with positive growth revisions for the last quarter of 2016 and high-frequency indicators for the second quarter of 2017, indicate stronger momentum in domestic demand than previously anticipated. This infographic has more details: The IMF has also cut its growth forecast for the US, having concluded that Donald Trump will struggle to deliver the infrastructure plan he promised. Growth this year has been cut from 2.3% to 2.1%, while 2018\u2019s forecast has been slashed from 2.5% to 2.1%. It says: While the markdown in the 2017 forecast reflects in part the weak growth outturn in the first quarter of the year, the major factor behind the growth revision, especially for 2018, is the assumption that fiscal policy will be less expansionary than previously assumed, given the uncertainty about the timing and nature of U.S. fiscal policy changes. Market expectations of fiscal stimulus have also receded. Britain\u2019s finance ministry has responded to the news that the International Monetary Fund have cut their UK growth forecasts this year. A Treasury spokesperson insisted \u201cthe fundamentals of our economy are strong\u201d, adding that the ongoing Brexit talks are crucial: \u201cThis forecast underscores exactly why our plans to increase productivity and ensure we get the very best deal with the EU are vitally important.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A new week brings new concerns over Britain\u2019s economy. The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecasts for UK growth this year, citing recent evidence that the economy is weakening. The IMF now expects Britain\u2019s GDP to only expand by 1.7% this year, down from 2% growth forecast in April. If they\u2019re right, it suggests that Brexit uncertainty may be hurting the UK. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, pointed to a marked change in early 2017. He said the UK\u2019s growth forecast had been lowered based on its \u201ctepid performance\u201d so far this year, adding: \u201cThe ultimate impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom remains unclear.\u201d The IMF still expect the UK to grow by 1.5% in 2018, but said one key risk facing the global economy was that the Brexit talks would end in failure. But the Fund is rather more optimistic about Europe. Germany\u2019s growth has been revised up by 0.2 points to 1.8%, France by 0.1 points to 1.5%, while Italy and Spain have both been revised up by 0.5 points to 1.3% and 3.1% respectively. Here\u2019s our full take: Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on the eurozone economy this morning, with the latest \u2018flash PMI\u2019 surveys from data firm Markit. They are expected to show that private sector companies in Germany and France continued to grow strongly this month, after posting their fastest growth since 2011 earlier this year. Royal Bank of Canada say: The day\u2019s main data release are \u2018flash\u2019 PMIs for the euro area, France and Germany. These are the readings for July so will provide an important indication of how the euro area economy has begun Q3. The June readings pointed to a slight loss of momentum at the end of the second quarter but that was coming off their highest level in six years in April and May and, at 56.4, the average composite reading for the quarter was still pointing to activity picking up from Q1. The fall between May and June was attributable to the service sector; by contrast the manufacturing PMI remained comfortably above its long-run average. With other indicators of domestic activity remaining robust we see some scope for the services PMI to recover a little this month and expect it to rise to 55.6 with the manufacturing reading remaining unchanged from its recent elevated level at 57.4.

A grand total of 2,529 products tracked by the Office for National Statistics have decreased in size over the past five years. In an analysis of the phenomenon known as \u201cshrinkflation\u201d, the ONS explored whether these dwindling portions are making life more expensive. The theory goes: if a chocolate bar gets smaller but the price stays the same, that is a form of inflation because you are paying more for each bite. The issue has regularly made headlines over the last year following the decline in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote. Food manufacturers have blamed the slump in sterling for increasing the price of imported ingredients and looked for ways to recover their extra costs. Toblerone, owned by Mondelez, spaced out its signature triangles so that there was less chocolate in each bar. Mars has shrunk its sharing bags of Maltesers by 15%. Doritos have downsized from 200g a packet to 180g, Peperamis have lost 2.5g and are now 22.5g and a big box of Coco Pops has been reduced from 800g to 720g. Of the total number of products that have got smaller, 2,006 were food items. Items that particularly stood out as having shrunk over recent years were bags of sweets, soft drinks, disposable nappies and toilet rolls. Only 614 products increased in size, including crisps and hand-rolling tobacco, following a change in the law requiring pouches to contain a minimum of 30g of tobacco. The ONS assures the public it catches this form of inflation because its hundreds of price collectors around the country always check the size of an item as well as the price when they are gathering information for each month\u2019s inflation figures. Using its data, the ONS has now summed up recent size changes, highlighting food as particularly prone to shrinkage. But it is only in the very sweetest sub-category of \u201csugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery\u201d that downsizing is having a noticeable effect on the official inflation figures. James Brown, a partner at the firm Simon-Kucher, which advises companies on pricing strategies, said the downsizing made sense. \u201cYou don\u2019t say: \u2018I want to consume 120g of chocolate.\u2019 We say: \u2018I want a chocolate bar that costs 75p or less\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cShrinkflation is actually quite a successful tactic because a lot of shoppers are more sensitive to a price change than to a weight change.\u201d With manufacturers facing higher costs for energy, ingredients, transport and packaging costs, he predicted more shrinkflation to come. Summing up its findings, the ONS said: \u201cNo, you\u2019re not imagining it \u2013 some of your favourite sweets really are shrinking. In November 2016, Toblerone chocolate bars reduced in size by about 10%, provoking outrage online. And Maltesers, M&amp;Ms and Minstrels have gone the same way. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just chocolate bars. Over the last few years, journalists have found examples of loo roll, coffee, fruit juice, sausages, beer and chips getting smaller without getting any cheaper.\u201d When the ONS looked at the data from the last five years, it found that \u201clots of the items we recorded had reduced in size or weight \u2013 mostly in the \u2018food and drink\u2019 category\u201d. But it said there was \u201cno discernable effect\u201d on inflation because food and drink was a relatively small part of the basket of goods and services that is tracked to gauge overall changes in the cost of living. But the ONS said that so far there was no evidence that the Brexit vote was to blame for size changes, and pointed out that shrinkflation pre-dated the EU referendum. The statisticians said most chocolate makers had blamed the need to downsize their products on rising raw material costs. But it pointed out that the European import price of sugar had been slowly falling since the middle of 2014. In March 2017 it reached its lowest level since records began in 1991. Similarly, the statisticians said the price of cocoa had reached a five-year high in December 2015 as a result of droughts in the three biggest cocoa-exporting countries, but it had fallen sharply over the last year. The ONS added: \u201cOur analysis doesn\u2019t show a noticeable change following the referendum that would point towards a Brexit effect.\u201d The figure of 2,529 shrinking products was taken from all the quotes recorded by collectors and the ONS said there could be some double counting if the same item was tracked by several people. Mark Jones, a food and drink solicitor at Gordons law firm, warned shrinkflation could intensify in the years ahead. \u201cWe will probably see a \u2018double whammy\u2019 after Brexit as inflation, labour shortages and tariffs could all mean pack sizes decrease and prices rise,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brexit is set to push up the price of the British banger, as wholesale pork and beef prices soared over the last year as a result of the weak pound and a surge in export demand. The cost of beef has rocketed to an all-time high \u2013 with prices up almost 40p per kg compared with July 2016 and an 11% increase year on year \u2013 according to an analysis by Beacon, a purchasing consortium which buys food for restaurants and hotels. But while beef prices are set to soften in the longer term, the report predicts, the price of pork is set to remain at high levels. The price of pork has risen by a third over the last year, and is currently 20% higher than in 2015. Imported pork commodity prices are also rising because of ongoing demand from China in the face of domestic shortages caused by flooding. \u201cThe cost of British, Irish and imported beef has risen and continues to rise dramatically, with current prices at an all-time high,\u201d said Paul Connelly, managing director of Beacon. \u201cPrime beef is in huge demand from both the UK retail and food service sectors but also more critically from abroad.\u201d Connelly said the latest inflation figures for the food service industry showed overall costs had risen by 9%, \u201cthe highest they have been in nine years and ... only a matter of time before suppliers and food service outlets will not be able to swallow up these increases and they\u2019ll begin to be passed on to the consumer\u201d. Beef prices would recover over the next 18 months, he predicted. \u201cHowever, the same cannot be said for pork production, which looks likely to struggle to remain competitive against international exporters and adverse exchange rates \u2013 so your sausages may be set to stay pricey.\u201d The scale of the wholesale price rises were confirmed by both the National Farmers\u2019 Union and the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), which represents the UK\u2019s major abattoirs and meat processors \u2013 including the ABP Food Group, Karro and Tulip \u2013 which supply supermarkets and other retailers. \u201cThe commodity price of both pigs and cattle has risen sharply this year, primarily driven by the weakness of the pound and how this is keeping the export markets buoyant,\u201d added Michael Fletcher, commercial director of the Co-op.",

    "webTitle": "Greece plans return to bond market as Athens sees end in sight to austerity", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Athens has outlined plans to return to the financial markets for the first time since 2014, with a plan to sell new five-year bonds to investors. Existing Greek five-year bonds were trading at 3.6% on Monday morning compared with 63% at the height of the Greek financial crisis in 2012 when the finance ministry was unable to pay public sector wages and there were riots in the streets. Following the announcement that Athens would be returning to the market, the yield fell to 3.4%. The Greek finance ministry has set a goal of a 4.2% interest rate on the new bond. But banking sources believe that level will be hard to achieve and say an interest rate of between 4.3% to 4.5% is much more likely. Government sources say valuation will take place on Tuesday 25 July. The market test is crucial to Greece for not only judging sentiment of the market, from which it has been essentially exiled since the start of its economic crisis, but also for weaning itself off borrowed bailout funds. Speaking after the bond issue was announced, the EU\u2019s economy commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, described the public spending cuts imposed on Greece since it almost went bust as \u201ctoo tough\u201d but \u201cnecessary\u201d, adding there was now \u201clight at the end of austerity\u201d. Reuters reported that Greece had employed six banks \u2013 BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and HSBC \u2013 to act as joint lead managers for a five-year euro bond \u201csubject to market conditions\u201d. Greek ministers will provide more details on Monday afternoon about how much it hopes to borrow, and on what terms. If the issue is successful, it could help Greece, which is still coping with a debt to GDP ratio of 180%, to exit its long cycle of austerity and rescue packages. Late on Friday, S&amp;P upgraded its outlook on Greek government debt from stable to \u201cpositive\u201d, thanks partly to renewed hopes that the country\u2019s creditors could finally grant it debt relief. The interest rates on Greek bonds have fallen away from their sky-high levels at the height of the crisis following a broad recovery across the 19-member eurozone and Athens\u2019 bigger than expected public sector surplus, fuelling hopes that the country could fund itself without the help of bailouts. Statements by the European Central Bank boss, Mario Draghi, have also appeared more supportive of southern European states, which remain highly indebted and are emerging only gradually from the after-effects of the financial crisis. \u201cSentiment is still very positive after the ECB sounded dovish at last week\u2019s meeting,\u201d said Benjamin Schroeder, a rates strategist at ING. Moscovici told France Inter radio before a visit to Athens for talks with Alexis Tsipras on debt relief that \u201cGreece was caught up in an incredible economic and financial storm\u201d. He said: \u201cToday, things are much, much better. We had to create the conditions for [investor] confidence, which was done. Was it too tough? Probably. Was it also necessary? Likewise,\u201d Moscovici said. The debt-ridden country went to the brink of collapse in 2010. It had to be repeatedly bailed out by its eurozone partners to prevent it bringing down the single currency bloc. In a sign that the country is turning a corner the economy is projected to grow by 2.1% this year \u2013 after no growth at all in 2016. Unemployment has fallen 1.9 percentage points in a year but was still stuck at 21.7% in April. The International Monetary Fund last week approved a one-year, $1.8bn loan programme for Greece. However, the IMF said it would not release any funds until the eurozone agreed on a deal to cut Greece\u2019s \u20ac314bn debt burden. Moscovici said the \u201c140 extremely courageous reforms\u201d undertaken by Athens meant there was now hope of \u201cfinally finding a solution to the debt problem\u201d.",

Ryanair\u2019s chief financial officer, Neil Sorahan, said the airline could review its second bag allowance, introduced in late 2013, as passengers were starting to \u201ctake the piss\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen two-year-olds wheeling a bag up to the plane as people try to take advantage.\u201d Fewer than one passenger in six now pays to check in luggage on Ryanair.

      "bodyText": "The bankers running JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs saw their shareholdings rocket in value by $314m last year due to the stock market surge following Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president. The JPMorgan boss, Jamie Dimon, and the Goldman Sachs chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, enjoyed rises of more than $150m (\u00a3115m) each in the value of their stock and options in the banks they run, according to an annual review of bank CEO pay by Equilar for the Financial Times (paywall). The other 18 best-paid bank chief executives in the world fared less well, with average gains of $4m in their stock-related holdings last year. Dimon was also the best-paid banking boss in the world for the second year running, raking in $28.2m of pay, bonus and pension contributions last year. The Morgan Stanley chief executive, James Gorman, came second at $22.5m, followed by Blankfein at $22.3m. Blankfein was the world\u2019s best-paid banker in 2013 and 2014. However, the average remuneration for the top 20 chief executives fell last year, the review found, to $12.5m, from $14.2m in 2015. The Bank of America boss, Brian Moynihan, registered a big increase, of 23% to $20m. Shares in US banks soared after Trump\u2019s victory in the 9 November election, with Goldman\u2019s share price rising 24% in the last seven weeks of 2016. In Europe, bank bosses earned $8.5m on average, less than half of what their US peers made. HSBC\u2019s Stuart Gulliver enjoyed the biggest rise among European banking chief executives, up 32% in constant currency terms.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair made \u00a311.40 profit from every passenger it carried in the three months to June \u2013 up more than \u00a33 a head on the same time a year ago. However the airline remained cautious, issuing another warning about the disruption that could be caused by Brexit to UK flights in 2019. The Irish budget airline expects fares to fall by 5% this summer. The average fare rose by 1% to just over \u20ac40 (\u00a335.80) between April and June, its first quarter. Ryanair\u2019s profits over the last three months soared 55% to \u20ac443.7m, up from \u20ac286.5m a year earlier. The airline carried 35 million passengers, up 12% from last year. This means it made a profit per passenger of \u20ac12.70 (\u00a311.40), up from \u20ac9.20 (\u00a38.20). The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said the profits were boosted by the timing of Easter, but this was partly offset by the weaker pound and less revenue from checked bags as more customers took advantage of the airline\u2019s two free carry-on bags policy. However, only the first 90 passengers with wheelie bags are guaranteed space in the cabin. The airline cut costs by 6% as its fuel bill fell, despite the increase in passenger numbers. Keeping plane purchase, maintenance and staff costs low has allowed Ryanair to undercut rivals while raising profits. The fare cuts appear to have spooked investors, with Ryanair shares falling more than 5% in early trading. Rival EasyJet was also down, by more than 3%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at City firm ETX Capital, said: \u201cA huge jump in quarterly profits for Ryanair was not enough to assuage investor fears that the company is at the mercy of the pricing pressures felt across the sector. The push for more bums on seats means fares are coming down.\u201d Ryanair also confirmed it had made a bid for the struggling Alitalia, the Italian flag carrier which was put in special administration in May. Ryanair said it had put in a non-binding bid on Friday, the deadline, along with a number of other interested parties. The Irish airline is already the biggest player in Italy, with a near 30% market share. O\u2019Leary said that any takeover of Alitalia would be dependent on the airline being restructured and the removal of Italian government influence. Ryanair expects to carry 131 million passengers in the 12 months to March 2018, 1 million more than previously estimated, but stuck to its full-year forecast of post-tax profit of \u20ac1.4bn to \u20ac1.45bn. Ryanair continues to expand, ordering a further 10 \u201cGame Changer\u201d aircraft in June. It also agreed extensions of 10 operating leases. The Dublin-based company reiterated that it may be forced to cancel flights and move some, or all, of its UK-based aircraft to continental Europe from April 2019 depending on the terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU in March 2019. It continues to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU \u201copen-skies\u201d agreement, but is worried that \u201cshould the UK leave, there may not be sufficient time, or goodwill on both sides, to negotiate a timely replacement bilateral\u201d. The open-skies regulation allows all EU airlines and others in the \u201ccommon travel area\u201d including Morocco, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland to fly in and out of any country signed up to the pact. It binds EU members to regulatory oversight by the European court of justice and to freedom of movement, two red lines for the current UK government in Brexit talks. Ryanair had previously warned it would have to halt flights from the UK \u201cfor weeks or months\u201d if the UK government did not strike a bilateral aviation deal. \u201cThose trips down to Portugal and Spain, unless you can swim, aren\u2019t really going to happen,\u201d its finance chief told the Guardian in April.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "O2 has renewed its sponsorship of music venues across Britain, including the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, Brixton Academy and Manchester Apollo, in a deal thought to be worth about \u00a370m over the next decade. The agreement sees the mobile phone operator retain the O2 Academy naming rights to the music venues in 13 cities including Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne, Oxford, Sheffield and Leeds. The 10-year deal, struck with Live Nation and Academy Music Group which own the venues, is thought to be worth about \u00a37m a year, significantly more than the \u00a34.5m it paid under the previous deal. In February, the telecoms firm splashed out \u00a3125m to keep the naming rights to the London venue The 02, formerly known as the Millennium Dome, until at least 2027. Nina Bibby, chief marketing officer at O2, said the latest deal was a shot in the arm for the live music industry which has seen a huge number of smaller venues close across the country in the last decade. \u201cThe Academy venues are local venues, part of the communities in which they are located,\u201d she said. \u201cThey support grass roots music communities. It is amazing to me when you look at how the music industry has evolved over the last decade, live music is now so important to artists, the venues are to their communities and to music fans. This isn\u2019t just some badging exercise paying some money to be a naming partner. It is so much more than a sponsorship.\u201d Overall, attendance figures for live music \u2013 from bars and clubs to festivals and stadium tours \u2013 in the UK rose 12% to 30.9 million. Under the terms of O2\u2019s previous deal, which was originally struck in 2008 for five years and then extended for a further five, the company paid about \u00a34.5m a year to sponsor 11 venues. The bump up in price is partly owing to there now being 19 venues and also a significant increase in perks O2 can offer its customers. This will include a doubling of the number of tickets available for customers through its priority tickets service, which makes them available 48 hours before they go on general sale. The extra allotment of tickets will also extend to other Live Nation-promoted showswhich O2 says give it access to venues \u201cfrom the smallest of rooms to stadia\u201d. O2 will also give the venues a digital upgrade three years on from introducing free wifi across the 19 venues. The company, which is owned by Spanish telecoms company Telefonica, is expected to be an aggressive bidder in broadcasting regulator Ofcom\u2019s upcoming multi-billion pound auction for mobile spectrum that will enable 5G services in the next decade. O2 is seeking to return to the stock market with an \u00a311bn initial public offering potentially later this year.",

      "bodyText": "Pound edges up against the dollar on rate hike speculation The pound slumped to three-decade lows against the US dollar after the Brexit vote over worries about the UK economy\u2019s long-term prospects outside the EU. Over the past month, sterling has edged up slightly against the US currency. This is partly because some investors have brought forward expectations of when the Bank of England will raise interest rates from an all-time low of 0.25%, but it is also because the dollar has weakened against a range of currencies. Compared with the night of the referendum in June last year, the pound is still down about 13% against the dollar and around 14% down against the euro. Stock markets keep climbing The FTSE 100 index of shares in big companies plunged the day after the referendum but quickly recovered and ended 2016 at a record high. That rise was driven in part by the pound\u2019s weakness which helps the many companies in the index that report in dollars and those blue chip companies with a large proportion of foreign earnings. While the FTSE 100 has not surpassed the record high achieved in early June, the index is up over the last month and is now around 18% above its level on the night of the Brexit vote. The FTSE 250 index of midcaps is up about 14% from its level on 23 June 2016. Lower than forecast Inflation falls for the first time in nine months Inflation has risen rapidly since the EU referendum as the sharp drop in the value of the pound pushes up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Last month, however, inflation fell unexpectedly and for the first time in nine months to 2.6%, down from a four-year high of 2.9% in May. The fall was mainly driven by lower fuel prices, reflecting weaker oil prices and providing some respite for cash-strapped consumers. But household budgets are still under pressure from falling real pay, as inflation outpaces wage growth of 1.8%. Worse than forecast UK\u2019s trade performance worsens Policymakers are hoping that stronger exports and business investment will help to offset a downturn in consumer spending. The latest official trade figures showed that exports did rise in May, by 2.5%, but imports rose by an even bigger 4.8%. That meant the deficit in trade in goods with the rest of the world widened more than expected, to \u00a311.86bn in May from \u00a310.6bn in April. When services such as banking and legal work were included, the deficit widened by \u00a31bn to \u00a33.1bn, reflecting an increase in imports. Worse than forecast Growth in business activity slows across key sectors UK firms had a tougher time in June than was expected, with business activity growing at its weakest pace for four months. Growth slowed in all three key areas of manufacturing, construction and services according to the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs). Growth in services, Britain\u2019s biggest sector, was particularly weak, as consumer-facing businesses including hotels and restaurants were hit by the squeeze on household incomes. The PMIs are tracked for early clues on official GDP figures, and the authors of the reports said that despite weakness in June, the second quarter overall was on track to beat 0.2% growth in the first quarter. Public finances are in worse shape A slowing economy, rising inflation and a decline in corporation tax receipts meant the UK borrowed more than expected in June, with the country\u2019s budget deficit rising to \u00a36.9bn \u2013 almost 50% higher than in the same month last year. Higher inflation, which followed sterling\u2019s slump after the Brexit vote, pushed up the cost of financing the portion of government debt linked to rising prices. Lower GDP growth in the first quarter put pressure on tax receipts while a bigger than expected contribution to the EU budget added to the \u00a32bn of extra borrowing. After the first three months of the financial year, borrowing was up almost 9% compared with the first quarter of last year. Unemployment better than forecast, wages as expected Real pay falls despite surprise drop in jobless rate Household budgets have come under pressure from a fall in real pay, as prices rise faster than wages. That trend continued, according to the latest data, which showed average earnings including bonuses (shown above) rose 1.8% in the three months to May, year on year. That was in line with expectations, but a slowdown compared with 2.1% growth in the three months to April. Adjusting for inflation, pay fell by 0.7% over the period, the biggest drop since the summer of 2014. Real pay fell despite a surprise drop in the unemployment rate from 4.6% to 4.5%, which was the lowest since 1975. Better than forecast Retail sales bounce back in the warm weather Retail sales rebounded in June as the warm weather encouraged consumers to splash out on summer clothing. Sales volumes rose by 0.6% over the month, beating the 0.4% increase forecast by economists. The rise followed a sharp 1.1% drop in May. A better-than-expected June pushed up retail sales by 1.5% in the second quarter overall, following a 1.4% first-quarter fall. Worse than expected House price growth slows The latest monthly snapshot of the housing market from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) showed house prices rose at the slowest rate in 11 months in June. A net balance of 7% of surveyors saw prices rise rather than fall in June, down from 17% in May. It was the weakest since July 2016, a month after the Brexit vote, as political uncertainty weighed on the property market. The picture differed regionally, with London being the weakest market, followed by the south-east. And another thing ... productivity has fallen UK productivity has dropped back to where it was at the end of 2007 just before the economy was plunged into recession. Official figures from the ONS showed output per worker fell 0.5% in the first three months of 2017, damaging living standards and ending a run of positive quarterly growth in 2016 which had pulled productivity just above the 2007 peak. The ONS said that had productivity in the UK returned to its pre-recession trend, it would be 20% higher than its current level, meaning Britain would be one-fifth better off.

      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from June 2006 to May 2009 I keep waiting for the good news that the Brexiters told us would come once the vote to leave the EU was in. The vote was an unexpected shock to the markets that was always going to take a while to work its way into the main economic data. A year on, Britain is the slowest-growing country in both the G7 and the EU28. In the first quarter of 2017, the UK grew 0.2%, whereas the eurozone grew by 0.6%. As a result of the Brexit vote and the economic uncertainty it unleashed, Britain is fast becoming the sick man of Europe. That seems unlikely to change soon. Once again this month, there is only thin economic gruel in the data. The UK economy is continuing to be impacted by the fall in the pound post-Brexit, which has raised import prices, resulting in a temporary rise in inflation. The consumer prices index came in at 2.6% for June which was below what most commentators had expected. But the latest estimate for nominal wage growth, that is not adjusted for price changes, for May fell to 1.8% down from 2.1% in April. Real wage growth started falling in April at -0.3% and the rate of decline accelerated in May to -0.7%. UK productivity performance continues to be disastrous, dropping back to where it was at the end of 2007. Output per worker fell 0.5% in the first three months of 2017. The French continue to produce in four days what Britain produces in five. The major consequence of this is likely to be a fall in demand going forward. The latest retail sales numbers suggested a pickup in June with decent weather after a disastrous May. But, on the year, sales are broadly flat and going nowhere. The rise in unsecured borrowing is likely coming to an end. The savings rate, which is at historically low levels, is inevitably going to pick up as people start saving for a rainy day driven by Brexit uncertainty. Industrial production is falling. There is no floor in sight. The concern is that the monetary policy committee has little firepower to help if things get worse with rates so close to zero, and the chancellor seems to be awol. Here\u2019s hoping. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 The evidence from business surveys and other economic indicators is consistent with continued slow growth in the UK economy in the second quarter. PwC\u2019s \u201cnowcast\u201d of GDP growth points to a 0.3% increase in Q2, after 0.2% in Q1. That is equivalent to annualised growth of just 1% in the first half of this year, less than half the average growth rate of around 2.5% which the UK economy enjoyed from 2013 until 2016. The squeeze on consumer spending from higher inflation is one of the key drivers of the slowdown. Even though retail sales picked up in June, this was only a partial recovery from the drop in May. The average level of retail sales volumes in the first half of this year is almost identical to the second half of 2016. In other words, the underlying trend is flat, after three years (2014 to 2016) when average retail sales growth was nearly 4.5% a year. It is not hard to explain why the momentum of consumer spending has stalled so badly. Real wages are now falling, even though inflation fell back to 2.6% in June. The main reason for the fall in inflation was the drop in the oil price, but it is still reasonable to expect inflation to rise above 3% later this year as the weakness of sterling continues to feed through to the prices paid by consumers. The employment figures paint a more positive picture, with the jobless rate dropping to 4.5% \u2013 the lowest we have seen for more than 40 years. But if slow growth continues through this year, as seems likely, unemployment is likely to start edging up. The jobs market is normally a lagging indicator of the economy, so the weakness in GDP growth in the first half of this year is likely to put a dampener on job creation in the remainder of 2017.",

The vote was an unexpected shock to the markets that was always going to take a while to work its way into the main economic data. A year on, Britain is the slowest-growing country in both the G7 and the EU28. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/08/uk-economy-falls-to-bottom-of-eu-growth-league\">In the first quarter of 2017, the UK grew 0.2%, whereas the eurozone grew by 0.6%.</a> As a result of the Brexit vote and the economic uncertainty it unleashed, Britain is fast becoming the sick man of Europe.

The UK economy is continuing to be impacted by the fall in the pound post-Brexit, which has raised import prices, resulting in a temporary rise in inflation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/18/uk-inflation-falls-first-time-9-months-fuel-prices\">The consumer prices index came in at 2.6% for June</a> which was below what most commentators had expected. But the latest estimate for nominal wage growth, that is not adjusted for price changes, for May fell to 1.8% down from 2.1% in April. Real wage growth started falling in April at -0.3% and the rate of decline accelerated in May to -0.7%. UK productivity performance continues to be disastrous, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/05/productivity-usually-bounces-back-after-a-recession-britain-economy\">dropping back to where it was at the end of 2007</a>. Output per worker fell 0.5% in the first three months of 2017. The French continue to produce in four days what Britain produces in five. </p> <p>The major consequence of this is likely to be a fall in demand going forward. The latest retail sales numbers suggested a pickup in June with decent weather after a disastrous May. But, on the year, sales are broadly flat and going nowhere. The rise in unsecured borrowing is likely coming to an end. The savings rate, which is at historically low levels, is inevitably going to pick up as people start saving for a rainy day driven by Brexit uncertainty. Industrial production is falling. There is no floor in sight.</p> <p>The concern is that the monetary policy committee has little firepower to help if things get worse with rates so close to zero, and the chancellor seems to be awol. Here\u2019s hoping. </p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <h2><strong>Andrew Sentance</strong></h2> <p><strong>Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011</strong></p> <p>The evidence from business surveys and other economic indicators is consistent with continued slow growth in the UK economy in the second quarter. PwC\u2019s \u201cnowcast\u201d of GDP growth points to a 0.3% increase in Q2, after 0.2% in Q1. That is equivalent to annualised growth of just 1% in the first half of this year, less than half the average growth rate of around 2.5% which the UK economy enjoyed from 2013 until 2016.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/24/brexit-economy-sterling-fall-hits-public-finances-and-fails-to-boost-trade\">Brexit economy: sterling fall hits public finances and fails to boost trade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The squeeze on consumer spending from higher inflation is one of the key drivers of the slowdown.

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecast for the UK economy this year after a weak performance in the first three months of 2017. In its first downgrade for the UK since the EU referendum in June last year, the IMF said it expected the British economy to expand by 1.7% this year, 0.3 points lower than when it last made predictions in April. The Fund raised its forecasts for the UK after the Brexit vote as a result of the much stronger than envisaged activity in the second half of 2016. In October 2016, it pencilled in growth of 1.1% for 2017, raising this forecast to 1.5% in January this year and to 2% in April. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, pointed to a marked change in early 2017. He said the UK\u2019s growth forecast had been lowered based on its \u201ctepid performance\u201d so far this year, adding: \u201cThe ultimate impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom remains unclear.\u201d The IMF left its growth forecast for the UK in 2018 unchanged at 1.5% but said one key risk facing the global economy was that the Brexit talks would end in failure. It contrasted its gloomier outlook for the UK with a rosier forecast for the rest of the EU, with 2017 growth upgrades for the four biggest eurozone countries \u2013 Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Germany has been revised up by 0.2 points to 1.8%, France by 0.1 points to 1.5%, while Italy and Spain have both been revised up by 0.5 points to 1.3% and 3.1% respectively. The Fund produces a world economic outlook in April and October to coincide with its spring and annual meetings, but provides updates in January and July. Launching the report in Kuala Lumpur, Obstfeld said the IMF had left its global growth forecasts unchanged at 3.5% in 2017 and 3.6% for next year, noting that the stronger performance by the eurozone, China and Japan had been offset by weaker performances elsewhere. \u201cThe recovery in global growth that we projected in April is on a firmer footing; there is now no question mark over the world economy\u2019s gain in momentum,\u201d Obstfeld said. He added that Donald Trump\u2019s failure so far to push through his promised package of tax cuts had dampened US growth prospects. \u201cFrom a global growth perspective, the most important downgrade is the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the next two years, US growth should remain above its longer-run potential growth rate. But we have reduced our forecasts for both 2017 and 2018 to 2.1% because near-term US fiscal policy looks less likely to be expansionary than we believed in April.\u201d Three months ago, the IMF said it expected growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy to be 2.3% this year and 2.5% next. The Fund said that while the risk of a repeat of the electoral shocks of 2016 \u2013 Brexit and Trump\u2019s presidential victory \u2013 had declined, policy uncertainty remained at a high level and could rise further. It singled out \u201cdifficult-to-predict US regulatory and fiscal policies, negotiations of post-Brexit arrangements, or geopolitical risks\u201d, all of which it said could harm confidence, deter private investment, and weaken growth.",
