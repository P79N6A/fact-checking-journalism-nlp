      "bodyText": "Wall Street has staged a sharp recovery after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, promised economic reforms and lower import tariffs, soothing fears over the country\u2019s simmering trade standoff with the US. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained by more than 500 points in early trading on Tuesday in New York, and ended the day 429 points up at 24,408. The biggest gains were tech stocks and companies such as Boeing and Caterpillar, which were seen to be among the biggest potential losers from a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. European shares also rallied amid renewed hope for a solution in the trade showdown triggered by Donald Trump, with the FTSE 100 ending the day 1% higher at 7,266. The pound rose on international exchanges after Bank of England rate-setter Ian McCafferty said Threadneedle Street \u201cshouldn\u2019t dally\u201d when it comes to raising the cost of borrowing \u2013 expected by investors from as early as next month. In his first public comments since the trade dispute started with Trump, Xi used a speech in Beijing to promise to open up the country\u2019s economy. He also said China would raise the foreign ownership limit for companies operating in the nation\u2019s aircraft, shipbuilding and motor industries. \u201cThis year, we will considerably reduce auto import tariffs and at the same time reduce import tariffs on some other products,\u201d he said. The better news for investors comes after warmer words from both Beijing and Washington in the latest signs of a climbdown from the brink of a potentially damaging trade war. Writing in the Guardian, the Chinese ambassador to the UK said such an economic conflict \u201cshould and can be avoided\u201d. While warning China had no choice but to take firm counter-actions in the face of Trump using the \u201claw of the jungle\u201d for trade disputes, Liu Xiaoming wrote: \u201cChina has not, however, closed the door to negotiations and consultations. On the contrary, we will continue to deepen reform and open up on all fronts with a view to building closer trade and economic partnerships with the world.\u201d Seeking to solve the standoff through established international channels, China filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation challenging Trump\u2019s tariff plans for steel and aluminium imports, with the country asking for 60 days of consultations with the US. If those talks should fail, the next step would be for a panel of trade experts to make a ruling. In Britain, the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 included mining companies such as Anglo American and Glencore, which gained because of investors\u2019 hopes that a resolution to the US-Sino trade dispute would reduce the likelihood of US punitive tariffs on commodities. The Trump administration has outlined $50bn of import tariffs on Chinese goods arriving in America, which China then said it would match for US imports. Trump then said he would consider an additional $100bn on Chinese products, raising the stakes and rattling financial markets last week. However, the US president said on Sunday that Beijing would ease trade barriers \u201cbecause it is the right thing to do\u201d, in a move that was seen as easing fears over the brewing trade war. Joshua Mahony of financial spreadbetting firm IG said: \u201cTalk of China easing their import restrictions are helping drive global market sentiment higher.\u201d",

UK consumers will next week be the first in Europe able to buy Nestl\u00e9\u2019s four-finger KitKat, made with so-called ruby chocolate from specially selected cocoa beans. KitKat is the first major brand in the UK to feature this innovative but \u201cnaturally coloured\u201d new chocolate, made from ruby cocoa beans grown in the Ivory Coast, Ecuador and Brazil. It was created by Swiss chocolatier Barry Callebaut - the world\u2019s largest cocoa processor - which spent more than a decade unlocking and experimenting with the beans\u2019 colours and flavours. The flavour is described by the company as \u201ca tension between berry-fruitiness and luscious smoothness\u201d but no extra colours or flavours are added to create the pinky hue, which instead comes from a powder extracted during the processing. It is not as sweet as milk chocolate, according to its creators, with a lighter flavour instead. Ruby chocolate \u2013 a fourth chocolate after traditional dark, milk and white \u2013 has been attracting huge interest from chocolate connoisseurs throughout the world since it was first revealed in September last year. It is claimed to be the first new natural colour for chocolate since Nestl\u00e9 unveiled white chocolate more than 80 years ago. The new KitKat was introduced earlier this year in Japan and Korea, where consumers are no strangers to unusual variations of the popular confectionery. In Japan the varieties on sale at any given time stretch to dozens, including purple sweet potato, edamame bean and wasabi. In the UK it will go on sale in branches of Tesco on 16 April. \u201cWe know that a new type of KitKat is a really big deal and we are very excited to be able to offer a different type of chocolate for fans to try\u201d said Alex Gonnella, marketing director for Nestl\u00e9\u2019s UK confectionery business. \u201cRuby chocolate is a big innovation in confectionery and we are very proud that KitKat is the first major brand in the UK to feature this exciting new chocolate.\u201d Pablo Perversi, chief innovation, quality and sustainability officer at Barry Callebaut, said: \u201cI am very pleased to see the result of our partnership with Nestl\u00e9 \u2013 the iconic four-finger KitKat made with our ruby chocolate. Consumers across the world will be intrigued by the unique taste of this crispy delight.\u201d Following the UK launch, the product will go on sale across Europe and the US.",

      "bodyText": "EDF Energy has warned that a flagship nuclear power station it is building in France could run further behind schedule and over budget, after it detected faults at the \u20ac10.5bn ( \u00a39.2bn) plant. The French state-owned firm said inspections last month had uncovered problems with welding on pipes at the Flamanville plant in north-west France. Flamanville\u2019s reactor design is the same as the one being used at a delayed plant in Finland and at Hinkley Point in Somerset, where EDF is building the UK\u2019s first new nuclear power station in decades. The company said that it had discovered \u201cquality deviations\u201d on 150 welds in a system used to transport steam to turbines used for electricity generation. EDF said it was performing further checks to see what works would be needed to satisfy the safety requirements of the French nuclear regulator, ASN, and would report back in May. In a statement, the firm said: \u201cFollowing the current checks and the licensing process by the ASN, EDF will be able to specify whether the project requires an adjustment to its timetable and its costs.\u201d The plant is already three times over its original estimates and several years late. Nuclear industry experts said the announcement cast doubt over whether Flamanville unit three would be operational by the end of 2019, as planned. Stephen Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich said: \u201cIf remedial work is needed, this puts in further doubt whether Flamanville can be in commercial operation [as previously planned].\u201d ASN warned earlier this year that the start-up schedule for Flamanville was tight. Paul Dorfman, of the Energy Institute at University College London, said the problems did not bode well for Hinkley Point C, which is due to come online in 2025. \u201cIf they can\u2019t build their own reactor in France, where can they build it? This seems counter to their claims that they are learning from their mistakes and Hinkley won\u2019t be a repeat.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets are moving higher after a speech by China\u2019s president Xi at the Boao Forum defused some of the fears of a trade war between Beijing and the US. Xi said China would take measures to widen market access for foreign investors and would lower import tariffs on products including cars. However China is reported to have filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over the proposed US tariffs on steel and aluminium. And investors still face a number of other uncertainties, not least the US sanctions on Russia which has hit the rouble hard. Elsewhere, Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty said the monetary policy committee should not dally over raising UK interest rates given wage growth and the strength of the global economy. The comments gave a lift to the pound. Meanwhile European Central Bank member Ewald Nowotny said it was time to \u201cnormalise\u201d its monetary policy. And in the US, producer prices rose by more than expected in March, giving more ammunition to the Federal Reserve to increase borrowing costs. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. With trade war fears easing after the overnight speech from Chinese president Xi, US markets have opened sharply higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 390 points or 1.63% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.36% and the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 1.65%. Commenting on the Xi speech to Reuters, strategist Art Hogan at Wunderlich Securities in New York said: The expectation was [the Xi speech] could have gone one of two ways: he could have been aggressive about US tariffs or been conciliatory, and it feels like he\u2019s more conciliatory. Back with the Boao Forum in China, and the managing director of the International Monetary Fund has also had talks with president Xi: Stronger than forecast US producer price figures for March give more ammunition for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again later this year. The Fed has indicated it could increased borrowing costs another two times in 2018 but some expect another rise on top of that if the economic data merits it. So a 0.3% rise in the producer price index last month adds fuel to those expectations. That is an increase from the 0.2% rise in February, and higher than analyst forecasts of 0.1%. The year on year increase in March was 3%, up from 2.8% in the previous month and ahead of the 2.9% expected. The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures index, rose to 1.6% after being at 1.5% for four months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which released the data, said: A major factor in the March advance in prices for final demand services was the index for outpatient care (partial), which climbed 0.4 percent. The indexes for machinery, equipment, parts, and supplies wholesaling; cable and satellite subscriber services; airline passenger services; food and alcohol wholesaling; and hospital inpatient care also moved higher. In contrast, margins for automotive fuels and lubricants retailing fell 10.4 percent. The indexes for apparel, footwear, and accessories retailing and wireless telecommunications services also decreased. As a sign things are a little calmer on the stock markets at the moment, the VIX volatility index - which had been rising in recent days - is currently down 5% at 20.61. That is not to say there are not a number of uncertainties for investors, from the US/China trade dispute, the situation in Syria, Russian sanctions and the latest on the Mueller investigation in the US. European stock markets are holding on to their gains, and Wall Street is still expected to open sharplyhigher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Dow Jones is all set to leap 320 points after the bell, a chunky jump that would take the beleaguered index to 24300, pushing it towards the top end of its recent trading bracket. However, it is important to note that the US open and close can often operate in completely different universes, especially if Trump gives into his urge to cause a bit of Twitter chaos. Brexit is getting real: The pound has hit a day\u2019s high of $1.4179, up 0.38% on the talk of further interest rate rises. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: Sterling has moved higher after some hawkish comments from BoE member McCafferty in which he cautioned fellow rate-setters against dallying when it comes to further tightening monetary policy. McCafferty was one of two dissenters who called for higher rates at the last meeting when the bank decided to keep its policy unchanged and his recent comments have pushed the pound/dollar rate to its highest level in more than a fortnight. With the bank expected to raise rates next month, remarks from the voting members will take on a greater importance in the coming weeks with the previous hike in November - the first such increase in more than a decade - being widely telegraphed in advance. Despite the slump in the rouble, Russia\u2019s central bank has no plans to introduce any measures to reduce volatility. The bank\u2019s first deputy chairman Sergei Shvetsov said the situation with the rouble was \u201cadequate\u201d, according to Reuters. And back with the effects of the US sanctions on Russian companies: At the time London stock exchange chief executive Xavier Rolet said: We warmly congratulate Mr Sokov and his management team on their successful IPO today. Welcoming En+ Group to London Stock Exchange is a significant milestone which underlines the City\u2019s position as the leading global listing venue for international companies and investors\u2019 appetite for Russian issuers. With 100 Russian and CIS businesses listed and traded on London\u2019s markets, with a total capitalisation of over $550 billion, London is a strong partner to Russian companies seeking access to global investor capital, as well as an open and dynamic place to do business. And the company was invited to open trading on the day it listed in November: The average British household benefited from the Bank of England\u2019s emergency interest rate cut in the financial crisis to the tune of almost \u00a39,000 in pay and \u00a390,000 in household wealth, according to its chief economist. Speaking in Australia, Andy Haldane is defending some of the benefits from low interest rates just before Threadneedle Street looks to increase them to levels unseen since the 2008 crash began. According to him, the impact of low rates and quantitative easing has been to keep more people in work - helping them with their earnings - and to keep borrowing costs cheap to help cut mortgage costs. Asset prices have also been inflated, helping those who held them - even if they got less on their cash savings held in bank accounts. The significance of the loose monetary policy from the Bank is so significant, he says, that GDP in the UK would have been around 8% lower, unemployment 4 percentage points higher and the level of consumer prices 20% lower without its package to cut rates to 0.5% and inject \u00a3435bn into the economy through QE. Just 4% of households were made \u00a3500 or more worse off when taking income and wealth effects together, he says. And here is the dramatic movement in the rouble - it shows the rise in the number of roubles needed to buy one dollar: Meanwhile the Russian rouble continues to come under pressure following the US sanctions against a number of its companies. The currency is down around 4% against the dollar to 63.28, its second day of heavy losses and its lowest level since December 2016. And there is another twist in the trade dispute between the US and China. Associated Press reports: China is filing a complaint with the World Trade Organisation against U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminium products. The Geneva-based trade body said on Tuesday that China has requested 60 days of consultations with the United States to resolve the dispute. If the two sides can\u2019t agree on a solution, the next step could be for Beijing to request a ruling from a panel of trade experts. China claims the duties of 25 percent on imports of steel and 10 percent on imports of aluminum products breach international trade rules. The Bank of England is not the only central bank to be considering reigning in the financial stimulus - low interest rates and quantitative easing - that have supported stock markets since the financial crisis. Speaking in London, European Central Bank policymaker and Bank of Austria governor Ewald Nowotny said it was now time to \u201cstart the gradual normalisation of monetary policy.\u201d He said: We are at an important turning point in monetary policy. We must normalise policy not too soon but not too late. He said there was the risk of stifling the recovery if the ECB tightened monetary policy too soon, but also a risk of an asset boom if it tightened too late. Sterling has edged to a two week high after the comments from Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty that there should be no delay in raising interest rates. The pound hit $1.4168 against the dollar in the wake of the remarks, up 0.28%. Against the euro sterling is 0.13% better at \u20ac1.1485. UK interest rates should be raised again without delay, a leading Bank of England policymaker has said. After its meeting last month the Bank hinted at an increase in May, and in an interview with Reuters, Ian McCafferty said the prospect of faster pay rises and a strong pick-up in the global economy emphasised the need for dearer borrowing costs before long. McCafferty said that wage growth, which has lagged inflation for much of the past decade, could prove to be stronger than many of his colleagues on the monetary policy committee believed. He told Reuters: We shouldn\u2019t dally when it comes to tightening policy modestly,. Reuters adds: McCafferty said he could not be certain about whether to vote again for a rate rise until May\u2019s policy meeting, but there had been no data or Brexit developments so far to make him think he was wrong in March to vote to raise rates to 0.75 percent. The former chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry has been in the minority of BoE policymakers pushing for a rate hike previously in the past four years. Speaking in his office in the BoE on Monday... McCafferty said that as well as the boost from the world economy\u2019s strong recovery, he thought there was now no slack left in Britain\u2019s labour market. Unemployment at its lowest rate since 1975, skill shortages and signs that employers were resorting to higher wage offers to lure staff from rival firms or stop them from leaving would also create inflation pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s not wages suddenly bursting away, but it gives you a modest upside risk,\u201d said McCafferty, whose term at the central bank ends in August. And the \u201cjury is still out\u201d on whether the inflationary hit from the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote in 2016 would fade as quickly as expected, he said. \u201cOn balance, those three arguments give me some potential modest upside risks to the (inflation) forecasts,\u201d McCafferty said. While the BoE had been wrong in the past about wages finally gaining momentum, labour market surveys so far this year showed that the recent recovery in the headline rate of growth of pay to nearly 3 percent looked more sustainable this time, he said. Often called one of the BoE\u2019s most hawkish policymakers, McCafferty said there had been a case for following up November\u2019s rate move with another hike as early as February. But he held off to avoid surprising households who had been told by the BoE that it plans to raise rates only gradually... On Brexit, McCafferty said British exporters remained in \u201ca sweet spot\u201d, helped by the weakness of the pound while concerns that they might lose business with supply chain customers elsewhere in the EU had so far proven overdone. But there were signs that British companies were wary about making long-term investments, and potential Brexit stumbling blocks would remain, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a permanent feature of the landscape,\u201d McCafferty said. Mining shares are leading the way in London, while news that US regulators have approved Bayer\u2019s takeover of Monsanto and a positive update from LVMH have also helped sentiment. But ahead of the start of the US reporting season, the main support for the market in early trading is Chinese president Xi\u2019s speech at Boao. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: What President Xi didn\u2019t say at the Boao Forum matters more than what he did. There are plenty of reforms to come, including reduced auto tariffs, but no details. But the lack of any ramping-up of the US/Chinese trade-war-by-rhetoric was the key for equities to rally. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor said: President Xi\u2019s speech overnight appears to have struck the right tone, providing some relief for investors who have been buffeted by the recent war of words between Trump and China over trade. While there was already an overwhelming sense that Chinese officials were keen to achieve a negotiated settlement before the proposed tariffs do any lasting damage to either the Chinese or US economies, today\u2019s speech was the clearest indication yet that China is prepared to take concrete steps to address some of Trump\u2019s chief criticisms. The big question is whether President Trump will now take the olive branch offered by Xi\u2019s conciliatory approach and dial down the rhetoric from his side too. Corporate profits have taken a back seat to trade tensions and increased volatility over the past few weeks, but as the US earnings season starts in earnest this week, they will take on huge significance. Equities received a huge boost when the US tax reform bill was signed into law in December and investors will want to see that this is feeding through to the bottom line to justify their continued faith. A good earnings season would do a lot to regain some equilibrium and provide some much-needed relief and calm for beleaguered investors. As fears of a trade war between China and the US ease - for the moment - after president Xi\u2019s speech overnight, European markets have opened in a positive mood. The FTSE 100 is up 0.5% or 41 points, while Germany\u2019s Dax has added just over 1%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.8% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.6% better. And the US futures are predicting the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which added just 0.19% in the end on Monday - will open around 360 points higher or 1.5%. More fallout from the US imposition of sanctions on various Russian companies. Glencore, which has various contracts with Russia\u2019s Rusal for the purchase of aluminium, says it is now evaluating these contracts. Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg has resigned from the Rusal board, and a deal for Glencore to swap its shares in Rusal for global depository receipts in EN+ - which manages the assets of Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska - will not now go ahead. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A keynote speech by Chinese president Xi Jinping at the Boao Asian forum overnight has eased some of the concerns about a possible trade war with the US. America had proposed slapping tariffs on $50bn - or even $100bn - worth of Chinese products which prompted a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. Weekend comments from Donald Trump seemed to suggest the two sides might be able to reach a compromise, but on Monday, in typical fashion, the US president came out fighting again: So Xi\u2019s comments at Boao were awaited with some trepidation. Investors were hoping to hear some positive news on China opening up its markets but were also wary of what he might say about Trump\u2019s threats. In the event Xi seemed to make some veiled criticisms of the US but also said China would take measures to widen market access for foreign investors and would lower import tariffs on products including, yes, cars. Here is our report on the speech: The news made for a positive performance on Asian stock markets, with the Nikkei 225 up 0.74%, and this is likely to translate into an opening rise in Europe: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Once again it is the background noise that is driving short term sentiment with big swings intraday making the price action difficult to predict. [Xi\u2019s] pledges to open up China\u2019s economy and lower import tariffs, while nothing particularly new, sent Asia markets higher and are likely to translate into a positive European open this morning. Whether they translate into anything other than words is another story but for now they appear to signal a willingness for China to move forward the discussions on trade with the US. But things are likely to remain volatile. For a start, as we know, Trump is nothing if not unpredictable, so his response to Xi\u2019s comments will be interesting. Plus there are wider issues to unsettle investors. The imposition of sanctions by the US on a number of Russian companies sent the country\u2019s market sharply lower on Monday, while growing tensions over Syria are also causing concern. The recent appointment of the hawkish John Bolton as the US national security advisor may not help matters. There is also the continuing dispute between the UK and Russia over the Salisbury poisoning. In the US itself, there are more uncertainties. The country faces a $1trn deficit, while Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen had his office raided by the FBI. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The raid was in connection with payments to adult star Stormy Daniels and conducted by the Justice Department with help from a referral from the Mueller investigation. The escalation that people are watching out for is that Trump responds by firing Robert Mueller. Political fireworks at home would put extra pressure on delicate trade negotiations. Elsewhere it is another fairly quiet day on the economic and corporate front, ahead of the start of the big US earnings season later this week.

While there was already an overwhelming sense that Chinese officials were keen to achieve a negotiated settlement before the proposed tariffs do any lasting damage to either the Chinese or US economies, today\u2019s speech was the clearest indication yet that China is prepared to take concrete steps to address some of Trump\u2019s chief criticisms.

Weekend comments from Donald Trump seemed to suggest the two sides might be able to reach a compromise, but on Monday, in typical fashion, the US president came out fighting again:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/983284198046826496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade.  No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE -  going on for years!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/983284198046826496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>So Xi\u2019s comments at Boao were awaited with some trepidation. Investors were hoping to hear some positive news on China opening up its markets but were also wary of what he might say about Trump\u2019s threats.</p> <p>In the event Xi seemed to make some veiled criticisms of the US but also said China would take measures to widen market access for foreign investors and would lower import tariffs on products including, yes, cars.</p> <p>Here is our report on the speech:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/xi-jinping-warns-against-arrogance-amid-threat-of-trade-war-with-us\">Xi Jinping warns against 'arrogance' amid threat of trade war with US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The news made for a positive performance on Asian stock markets, with the Nikkei 225 up 0.74%, and this is likely to translate into an opening rise in Europe:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/983578031540203520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTSE</a> 7235 +0.56%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DAX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DAX</a> 12373 +0.91%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CAC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CAC</a> 5314 +0.95%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIB</a> 23253 +0.86%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBEX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IBEX</a> 9819 +0.79%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/983578031540203520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 10, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once again it is the background noise that is driving short term sentiment with big swings intraday making the price action difficult to predict. [Xi\u2019s] pledges to open up China\u2019s economy and lower import tariffs, while nothing particularly new, sent Asia markets higher and are likely to translate into a positive European open this morning. Whether they translate into anything other than words is another story but for now they appear to signal a willingness for China to move forward the discussions on trade with the US.</p> </blockquote> <p>But things are likely to remain volatile. For a start, as we know, Trump is nothing if not unpredictable, so his response to Xi\u2019s comments will be interesting.</p> <p>Plus there are wider issues to unsettle investors. The imposition of sanctions by the US on a number of Russian companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/09/russian-firms-and-rouble-hit-heavily-by-trump-sanctions\">sent the country\u2019s market sharply lower on Monday</a>, while growing tensions over Syria are also causing concern. The recent appointment of the hawkish John Bolton as the US national security advisor may not help matters. There is also the continuing dispute between the UK and Russia over the Salisbury poisoning. </p> <p>In the US itself, there are more uncertainties. The country faces a $1trn deficit, while Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen had his office raided by the FBI. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The raid was in connection with payments to adult star Stormy Daniels and conducted by the Justice Department with help from a referral from the Mueller investigation. The escalation that people are watching out for is that Trump responds by firing Robert Mueller. Political fireworks at home would put extra pressure on delicate trade negotiations. </p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere it is another fairly quiet day on the economic and corporate front, ahead of the start of the big US earnings season later this week.</p> <p><strong>Agenda</strong>:</p> <p>8.30 BST: Bank of England\u2019s Ian McCafferty interview with Thomson Reuters</p> <p>10.30 BST: Speech by Bank of England\u2019s Andy Haldane in Melbourne</p> <p>13.30 BST: US producer prices index</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-10T06:58:01.487Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Glencore, the world\u2019s largest commodities trader, has begun cutting its ties with the Russian aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska after new US sanctions against his business empire. Glencore said it had cancelled the planned swap of its 8.75% stake in the Russian aluminium maker Rusal, which is controlled by Deripaska, for shares in the London-listed En+ Group, another of the oligarch\u2019s companies. Glencore\u2019s chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, has also resigned from the Rusal board. The Swiss-based commodities trader said it was evaluating other contracts with Rusal. It bought $2.4bn (\u00a31.7bn) of aluminium from Rusal in 2017 under a multi-year deal that is due to be renegotiated this year. \u201cGlencore is committed to complying with all applicable sanctions in its business and is taking all necessary measures in order to mitigate any risks to Glencore\u2019s business,\u201d it said. \u201cGlencore is still evaluating the position under its contracts with Rusal, but notes that these contracts are not financially material to Glencore.\u201d The rouble has lost about 4% against the dollar, its second day of heavy losses, falling to its lowest level since December 2016. The plunge came even though the Russian central bank chief, Elvira Nabiullina, said the country\u2019s economy could withstand the latest US sanctions. \u201cThe central bank has a broad spectrum of instruments in order to act in such situations, if risks arise to financial stability. In our view, there are not such risks now,\u201d Nabiullina told a conference in Moscow. \u201cThere is no need to take some kind of systemic measures. Of course we will follow the situation and possibly introduce some revisions if necessary.\u201d Russia\u2019s 50 richest men lost more than $16bn in value on Monday according to Bloomberg, with the biggest loser, Vladimir Potanin, not even on the sanctions list. A senior Russian official on Tuesday said the government was ready to step in if necessary to prevent bankruptcies or mass layoffs in some of the business empires targeted by the sanctions. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important now is to minimise uncertainty, above all by providing for the stable, calm operations of enterprises which employ hundreds of thousands of people \u2026 if necessary, we will facilitate the preservation of these enterprises\u2019 stable operations,\u201d said Arkady Dvorkovich, a deputy prime minister whose portfolio includes the economy, at a session of the Moscow Exchange Forum on Monday. The US sanctions have thrown Russian markets into some of its worst turmoil since 2014, threatening to derail the country\u2019s shaky economic recovery. How the government will protect those targeted is still unclear. The Russian business daily Vedomosti reported that the government is discussing plans to set up offshore zones inside the country to relieve financial burdens on sanctioned companies. And the government has threatened to punish companies that refuse to do business with those targeted by sanctions. In the past, the Russian government has offered means for sanctioned companies blocked out of markets to refinance their debt. More likely, sanctioned oligarchs will begin to cut formal ties with their companies. Shares in Glencore fell 2% on Friday when US sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 17 top government officials were announced, and a further 3.4% on Monday, with investors fretting over the impact on the company\u2019s aluminium business. On Tuesday, the shares rallied as much as 4.6% after some analysts said there would be little impact. Glencore\u2019s involvement in Rusal dates back to 2007, when Deripaska and fellow Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, who has also been sanctioned, merged their companies with Glencore\u2019s aluminium plants. Last October, when Deripaska wanted to float his holding company En+ Group in London, Glencore stepped in as a cornerstone investor, pledging to swap its 8.75% stake in Rusal for En+ shares. The sanctions announced last Friday ban US individuals and companies from doing business with Deripaska and his firms. While Glencore is not a US company, the penalties make it harder for anyone to work with the oligarch. Deripaska has called the sanctions \u201cgroundless, ridiculous and absurd\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Customers face above-inflation price hike as British Gas raises bills by 5.5%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Millions of British Gas customers will see their energy bills rise by 5.5% to an average \u00a31,161 a year, sparking criticism from the government and consumer groups. Ministers called the hike unjustified and said they were disappointed by the move. The UK\u2019s biggest energy supplier blamed the hike on rising wholesale gas and electricity prices, and government policies such as renewable energy subsidies, which are paid through energy bills. E.ON announced a stealth hike on energy bills of up to \u00a350 for some customers in March, but British Gas is the first large supplier this year to raise its standard variable tariff, the poor value tariffs that most households are on. The rise will hit 4.1 million of the firm\u2019s 7.8 million customers, who will pay \u00a360 extra a year from the end of May. The company confirmed it had also removed its cheapest deal, an online-only tariff. Claire Perry, energy minister, said the rise showed why the government was imposing a price cap. \u201cWe are disappointed by British Gas\u2019s announcement of an unjustified price rise in its default tariff when customers are already paying more than they need to,\u201d she said. Consumer group Citizen\u2019s Advice said there were \u201cserious question marks\u201d over whether the rise was really justified. Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com said customers would \u201crightly be furious\u201d but should also ask themselves why they had not switched to a cheaper supplier. The move comes days after energy regulator Ofgem raised a price cap on 5m vulnerable households, and ahead of the government\u2019s wider price cap for 11m households on standard variable tariffs. That ceiling is due to take effect before the end of the year. British Gas blamed higher energy costs, government policies to reduce carbon emissions and the \u00a311bn smart meter programme for the rise. Mark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica Consumer, part of the British Gas parent company, said: \u201cWe fully understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers\u2019 household bills. This increase we are announcing today is reflective of the costs we are seeing which are beyond our control.\u201d The firm repeated its suggestion that the government should shift green policy costs off energy bills and on to general taxation. Between August 2017 and February 2018, costs facing energy suppliers rose 7.9% primarily because of higher wholesale costs, according to Ofgem. British Gas stopped signing up customers to its standard variable tariff at the end of March, arguing it discouraged consumers from engaging in the market. But last week Ofgem approved the firm\u2019s request for an exemption allowing existing customers to stay on the tariff until mid-2019. Comparison sites said the increase would be a \u201cbolt from the blue\u201d for millions, and other large suppliers could follow with their own rises. \u201cThe danger now is that the rest of the big six may be tempted to follow suit. Customers can send the clearest message that they won\u2019t tolerate being taken for a ride by switching supplier to a cheaper tariff, with savings of up to \u00a3491 on offer,\u201d said Claire Osborne, energy expert at uSwitch.com. The Guardian reported in February that a new round of price increases was on the way, after smaller energy suppliers began raising tariffs. British Gas announced recently it would cut 4,000 jobs due to tough competition and the prospect of a government price cap. The company was the last of the big six to put up prices last year, when it raised dual fuel bills by 7.3% on 15 September. Separately on Tuesday, Co-operative energy said it had agreed a \u00a39.25m deal to buy Flow Energy, one of the smaller energy suppliers, adding 130,000 customers to its base of 320,000.",

The company confirmed it had also removed its cheapest deal, an online-only tariff.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Claire Perry, energy minister, said the rise showed why the government was imposing a price cap. \u201cWe are disappointed by British Gas\u2019s announcement of an unjustified price rise in its default tariff when customers are already paying more than they need to,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Consumer group Citizen\u2019s Advice said there were \u201cserious question marks\u201d over whether the rise was really justified.</p> <p>Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com said customers would \u201crightly be furious\u201d but should also ask themselves why they had not switched to a cheaper supplier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The move comes days after energy regulator Ofgem raised a price cap on 5m vulnerable households, and ahead of the government\u2019s wider price cap for 11m households on standard variable tariffs. That ceiling is due to take effect before the end of the year.<br></p> <p>British Gas blamed higher energy costs, government policies to reduce carbon emissions and the \u00a311bn smart meter programme for the rise.<br></p> <p>Mark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica Consumer, part of the British Gas parent company, said: \u201cWe fully understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers\u2019 household bills. This increase we are announcing today is reflective of the costs we are seeing which are beyond our control.\u201d<br></p> <p>The firm repeated its suggestion that the government should shift green policy costs off energy bills and on to general taxation. Between August 2017 and February 2018, costs facing energy suppliers rose 7.9% primarily because of higher wholesale costs, <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/data-portal/supplier-cost-index-fuel-type-gb\">according to Ofgem</a>. </p> <p>British Gas stopped signing up customers to its standard variable tariff at the end of March, arguing it discouraged consumers from engaging in the market. But last week <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/decision-grant-british-gas-trading-limited-temporary-and-limited-derogation-aspects-standard-licence-condition-22d-electricity-and-gas-supply-licences\">Ofgem approved the firm\u2019s request for an exemption</a> allowing existing customers to stay on the tariff until mid-2019.</p> <p>Comparison sites said the increase would be a \u201cbolt from the blue\u201d for millions, and other large suppliers could follow with their own rises.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe danger now is that the rest of the big six may be tempted to follow suit. Customers can send the clearest message that they won\u2019t tolerate being taken for a ride by switching supplier to a cheaper tariff, with savings of up to \u00a3491 on offer,\u201d said Claire Osborne, energy expert at uSwitch.com.</p> <p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/27/get-ready-for-a-new-round-of-energy-price-rises-industry-analysts\">reported</a> in February that a new round of price increases was on the way, after smaller energy suppliers began raising tariffs. </p> <p>British Gas announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/22/british-gas-cuts-4000-jobs-blaming-price-cap-and-tough-competition\">recently</a> it would cut 4,000 jobs due to tough competition and the prospect of a government price cap. The company was the last of the big six to put up prices last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/01/british-gas-hikes-electricity-prices-centrica-energy-bills\">when it raised dual fuel bills by 7.3% on 15 September</a>.</p> <p>Separately on Tuesday, Co-operative energy said it had agreed a \u00a39.25m deal to buy Flow Energy, one of the smaller energy suppliers, adding 130,000 customers to its base of 320,000.</p>",
