      "bodyText": "The Italian government is laying the groundwork for a potential \u20ac20bn rescue of the country\u2019s most troubled banks, including Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS). A government statement issued late on Monday night said that the prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, had convened a cabinet meeting to request the funds from parliament. The statement said: \u201c[It] could be necessary to adopt measures with the aim of protecting savers if there were risks in the financial sector\u201d. The vote in parliament could happen as soon as Wednesday, according to the Italian news agency Ansa. The news signals that a multi-billion euro refinancing of MPS could occur within days. Seven other banks that are struggling under the weight of bad loans amounting to billions of euros may also require government recapitalisation. The cabinet meeting was convened just hours after MPS, the world\u2019s oldest bank, formally launched a desperate attempt to stave off government rescue and raise \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.2bn) from private investors. It has less than 10 days to secure private funding before the government intervenes. The bank\u2019s shares fell 8.5% on Monday as it launched a share offering to institutional and retail investors. This measure runs alongside a plan to ask bondholders to swap their investments for shares, and a restructuring of \u20ac28bn of bad loans to clean up its balance sheet. However, with the clock ticking on wooing private-sector investors to support the fundraising, one of the key backers of the bank\u2019s planexpressed doubts. MPS announced that Quaestio, which manages the government-orchestrated bailout fund Altante, is concerned about the terms of a loan to support the parcelling-off of bad debts. The move could jeopardise the entire capital-bolstering exercise, which must be completed by the end of the year because of a deadline imposed by the European Central Bank after MPS was found to be the weakest performing of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests \u2013 a financial health check \u2013 in results published in July. MPS said: \u201cIf it is not possible for the bank to reach an agreement with Quaestio to resolve the issues that it has raised, the transaction would not be able to be completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the authorisation of the European Central Bank which provides for the transaction to be completed by 31 December 2016.\u201d The bank has become the focus of fears about the Italian banking system, which is saddled with \u20ac360bn of bad debts amassed in recent years during a period of economic weakness. UniCredit, Italy\u2019s biggest bank, last week announced plans to raise \u20ac13bn in a record-breaking share issue and axe 11% of the workforce. Those concerns have mounted after Italy\u2019s referendum on constitutional reform earlier this month led to the resignation of the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, creating fresh political turmoil in the midst of MPS\u2019s attempts to attract major investors to its fundraising. This fuelled fears that the Italian government would have to step in to help save the country\u2019s third biggest bank in a move that could force thousands of private investors, who hold \u20ac2.1bn worth of bonds, to take losses. New EU rules intended to protect taxpayers from bailing out banks mean that bondholders must take a hit before government money can be used. The Italian government has made clear it is ready to act as backstop to MPS, although last week Rome insisted the bank would be able to raise the funds through the markets. The announcement that Quaestio had concerns came just hours after the cash call on shareholders was announced. MPS said the body had, on 17 December, \u201cexpressed strong reservations in relation to the term sheet\u201d of the loan. MPS said it was in talks with Quaestio \u2013 which runs the \u20ac4.25bn Atlante backstop fund named after the Titan in Greek mythology who was condemned to hold up the sky \u2013 to try to resolve the matter. Atlante is backed by the Italian banking system: Unicredit pumped in \u20ac1bn to the fund, as did Intesa Sanpaola. Carlo Messina, chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, was quoted as saying that the MPS deal should go ahead and that a decision would be reached by Tuesday at the latest. In the meantime, the share offer for institutional investors closes on Thursday, while retail investors have to decide whether to buy shares by Wednesday. The Thursday deadline has sparked speculation that the Italian government might step in before the end of the week if it emerges that investors have failed to buy shares. If the Italian government had to stump up cash it would constitute a \u201cprecautionary recapitalisation\u201d because the bank holds enough capital to meet current regulatory minimums.",

      "bodyText": "Ratings agencies will not be reassured by a \u201cwafer thin\u201d projected surplus in 2021 based on budget cuts that can\u2019t pass parliament, the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has said after Monday\u2019s mid-year budget update. Warnings about Australia\u2019s triple A credit rating from the ratings agency Standard and Poors (S&amp;P) showed the need to raise more revenue as well as cut spending, Bowen said. But the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said he refused to give Labor and others a \u201cleave pass\u201d on the $13.2bn of unlegislated \u201czombie\u201d savings that have not passed parliament, some of which date back to the 2014 budget. Asked whether Australia could afford the government\u2019s $48bn 10-year company tax cut plan, Morrison told ABC radio there were \u201ctwin challenges\u201d: reducing the deficit and growing the economy. \u201cYou don\u2019t grow the economy by taxing it more and you don\u2019t grow the economy by increasing the deficit by your own decisions,\u201d he said. Morrison said Labor would have increased the deficit by $16.5bn over four years, even after scrapping the company tax cut plan. On Radio National, Bowen said Labor would have built in structural changes, including limiting negative gearing tax concessions, increasing capital gains tax and reforming the vocational loan system. Asked if the deficit would have been worse in the short term, Bowen agreed the structural measures would not have had a major impact in the 2016-17 fiscal year, but revenue and savings would \u201cbuild over time\u201d. Bowen said Labor had a realistic path to surplus because it was \u201cnot relying on things that won\u2019t pass the parliament\u201d. He said the purported $16bn gap between Labor and the government\u2019s plan was built on assumptions that job seekers would be forced to wait for Newstart and people would be forced to wait until they were 70 to get the pension, two measures blocked by parliament. Ratings agencies would look at both the four-year and 10-year plan and he was \u201cvery confident\u201d they would accept Labor\u2019s path to surplus was more believable. \u201cThey\u2019ve made it very clear the projected return to surplus in 2020-21 is key to them,\u201d he said. The government\u2019s projected surplus in 2021 projected in the mid-year economic and fiscal update was \u201cwafer thin and would be blown over in a breeze.\u201d Bowen said S&amp;P was pessimistic about Australia\u2019s triple A rating and required not just the successful passage of measures already announced but new revenue measures in particular. Morrison said the government had passed $22bn of budget savings in seven parliamentary sitting weeks and would \u201ccontinue to look for partners\u201d to pass the remaining $13.2bn of savings. He would not let parliament and Labor \u201coff the hook\u201d or give them a \u201cleave pass\u201d. \u201cThese are important changes ... I\u2019m very persistent and very determined to get budget back into balance,\u201d he said. Asked about further savings in next year\u2019s budget, Morrison said it would \u201caddress many issues\u201d and \u201cthat work has already begun\u201d. Labor had \u201cmade an art form\u201d of predicting surpluses that could blow over in the breeze, referring to the former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan\u2019s prediction of a slim $1bn surplus in 2013 that was knocked over not by a breeze but \u201ca hurricane\u201d. Morrison said $7.8bn savings booked in the Myefo for lower childcare costs was due to better modelling of growth in costs and shutting down \u201crorts\u201d causing massive growth in family daycare rebates. Morrison said extending the tax cut, particularly to companies with up to $10m turnover, would give them more head room to increase workers\u2019 hours or invest in equipment to expand their businesses. Labor supports a company tax cut only for companies with turnover less than $2m. Bowen said treasury modelling showed the $48bn tax cut package would boost the economy by only 1% over 20 years.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been ages \u2013 actually only three years \u2013 since the last parliamentary inquiry into the banking industry, but here comes the tireless Andrew Tyrie with another. The Treasury select committee is to ask whether the revamped capital rules, supported by arrangements to wind down failing banks, are up to the job. Taxpayers are supposed to be protected in another 2008-style crisis. Would they be? A collective groan, one suspects, will have passed across the banking sector at news of this inquiry. The so-called capital and resolution regime, after years of debate and fine-tuning, is supposed to be set in stone. The regulators perform stress tests on the big institutions every year; and the banks\u2019 role is to get on with the job of reorganising their operations to fit the new ringfenced model while reordering their capital structures to contain the correct portion of instruments capable of absorbing losses. Yet there are at least three reasons why Tyrie is right to have a prod. First, Sir John Vickers, one of the architects of ringfencing, is not convinced that the banks yet hold enough capital. The Bank of England disagrees, pointing out that the UK brigade has raised \u00a3130bn of new equity since the 2008, about twice the level of losses experience in the crisis. But that debate needs to be settled once and for all, preferably before the next crisis arrives. Second, the current crisis in the Italian banking industry is a reminder that talk of state-funded bailouts has not been banished forever, at least in the eurozone. The Italian banks may, in the end, get all their capital from the private sector, but it is not reassuring that there is even room for doubt. UK taxpayers deserve to hear, in detail, how it could never happen again here. Third, Royal Bank of Scotland is still 73% owned by taxpayers. To what degree is the state still on the hook should calamity strike? The select committee, let\u2019s hope, will be reassured. But this is the right moment to ask hard questions. Here\u2019s one for Tyrie to add to his list: given that the ringfencing rules don\u2019t come fully into force until 2019, how would the too-big-to-fail question be addressed before that date? Regulators tend to mutter and obfuscate when the question is put directly. Tyrie could do us all a favour by insisting on clarity. Drax fired up after EU nod It is only a slight exaggeration to say that Drax Group had bet the farm on winning EU state-aid approval to convert a third coal-burning unit to run on wood pellets. Without a thumbs-up, Drax would not have been able to afford its planned corporate reinvention via the \u00a3340m purchase of Opus Energy, a supply business serving small and medium-sized businesses. That deal, unveiled earlier this month, was conditional on Brussels coming good. There was relief all round, then, that EU approval arrived, just as the long-serving chief executive, Dorothy Thompson, predicted. The handout may only be a last hurrah for biomass subsidies since the last UK government made clear its preference for offshore wind in the renewables stakes. But there\u2019s nothing like the sight of guaranteed income \u2013 Drax will get \u00a3100 a megawatt hour at the converted unit \u2013 to lift an energy generator\u2019s spirits. Drax\u2019s shares rose 8% and have now improved by a quarter since the Opus announcement. Justified? Yes, probably. A month ago, Drax, the UK\u2019s largest power station, seemed destined to become an exercise in managed decline. Now \u201cretooling for a post-coal future\u201d \u2013 the clunky corporate slogan \u2013 may mean something tangible. Aside from coal and biomass, Drax will have a beefed-up supply business plus development sites to get into gas-fired stations one day. It is an odd collection of assets that one probably wouldn\u2019t design from scratch. But, yes, given Drax\u2019s turbulent history, one can call it a sensible diversification of risk. Apple\u2019s rotten jibe at Vestager The great EU versus Apple and Ireland tax battle will be fought on facts, in particular the right of Brussels\u2019 competition commissioner to intervene in the tax affairs of an EU member state. The legal scrap will take years. In the meantime, though, note Apple\u2019s petulant line about why it thinks it found itself in the sights of Margrethe Vestager. The Danish EU commissioner wanted a target that \u201cgenerates lots of headlines\u201d, claims the US technology company. This is self-regarding nonsense. When the sum at stake is \u20ac13bn (\u00a310.8bn) in allegedly unpaid taxes, Vestager would be failing in her job if she didn\u2019t act.",

      "bodyText": "Ticket resale websites and the touts who use them could be fined after the competition watchdog launched an investigation into how the best seats are harvested and then sold on at huge mark-ups before fans can buy them at face value. The Competition and Market Authority said it was examining suspected breaches of consumer law after reviewing the four secondary ticket companies \u2013 Viagogo, StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave \u2013 that sell on previously purchased tickets. It will examine several areas of concern in the secondary ticketing market, including whether touts use \u201cconnections\u201d at resale websites to gain an advantage over fans, such as information that helps them decide which tickets to market aggressively. The probe follows increasing scrutiny of the sector by MPs concerned about the inflated prices at which tickets are being sold. Earlier this month hundreds of tickets to see Adele next summer appeared on resale websites for up to \u00a39,000, the latest in a string of in-demand events seized on by the UK\u2019s most successful touts. Andrea Coscelli, acting chief executive of the CMA, said: \u201cA night out at a concert or a trip to a big match is something that millions of people look forward to. So it\u2019s important they know who they are buying from and whether there are any restrictions that could stop them using the ticket.\u201d \u201cIf we find breaches of consumer law, we will take enforcement action,\u201d he added. Rules introduced in 2015 require ticket resellers to provide details of the block, row and seat number, as well as the face value and information about any restrictions. Last year, the CMA secured pledges from the main websites that they would improve the information provided to buyers. The CMA said one site failed to comply with the demand to provide such information. GetMeIn, Seatwave and StubHub said they were not the site in question. Switzerland-based Viagogo did not return a request for comment. The watchdog has powers to force firms which breach the law to provide undertakings to improve their behaviour, while the courts can impose fines on those who do not. The CMA\u2019s investigation will also turn the spotlight on the touts, who are already facing the prospect of a tax investigation by HMRC. Those found to be concealing their identities or ticket details could face court-imposed fines. A CMA presentation given recently to the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers, seen by the Guardian, states that even the very act of bulk-buying tickets for resale is illegal. This is because anyone masquerading as a consumer for the purpose of business is in breach of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. The CMA\u2019s probe will also examine whether major touts, some of whom were named in an investigation by the Observer, are exploiting \u201cconnections\u201d at ticket websites. A whistleblower from one resale site said touts are sometimes handed inside information to help them grab the best seats at must-have concerts. Consumer body Which? urged the CMA to stake strong action. Vickie Sheriff, director of campaigns and communications at the consumer body, said: \u201cOn numerous occasions we have found tickets being sold unlawfully, so we welcome the competition authorities taking action to tackle this.\u201d Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Ticket Abuse, said it was \u201cparamount that enforcement action is taken seriously and swiftly\u201d. She also called on the government to tackle \u201cbulk purchasing\u201d by touts, amid calls to criminalise the use of \u2018bots\u2019, automated software sometimes used to buy large numbers of tickets. Despite the CMA\u2019s probe, some ticketing experts expressed disappointment. Music industry group FanFairAlliance said: \u201cUK audiences will continue to be frustrated that measures to genuinely fix ticket resale are not being taken sooner \u2013 and while other countries take swift and decisive actions, British fans continue to be ripped off by touts operating under cover on the Big Four resale sites. \u201cWe call on the government to respond to recommendations made in the Waterson review on secondary ticketing, and welcome the potential of a full inquiry by the select committee in the new year.\u201d A government-commissioned review by Prof Michael Waterson concluded this year that ticket resellers that do not comply with last year\u2019s rule changes should be taken to court. The government has yet to respond to the review. Security consultant Reg Walker, who recently testified to MPs about \u201cticket abuse\u201d, cast doubt on the CMA\u2019s assertion that most ticket sites are now complying with consumer protection laws. \u201cGiven the information in the public domain about all four websites, I fail to see how any are fully complying with the Consumer Rights Act, let alone just one.\u201d Walker called on the CMA to demand firms hand over records of the touts who use them, to establish whether they are breaking the law.",

      "bodyText": "The current \u201cinefficient and confusing\u201d system of government-backed financial help for consumers is to be replaced with a new one-stop-shop organisation that will advise consumers about debt, pensions and scams. This new body will replace three existing publicly-funded organisations, one of which came under fire for spending more than \u00a3100m on marketing and advertising in an attempt to increase brand awareness. The Treasury said the new system would make it easier for consumers to get the financial help they needed at a time when demand for debt advice was increasing and millions of people had more choices about what to do with their retirement cash. This new body, which is yet to be named, will replace the Money Advice Service (MAS), the Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS) and the government\u2019s Pension Wise service, which all provide free and impartial financial guidance. In his March 2016 budget, the then chancellor George Osborne said the plan was to create two new organisations, one of which would focus purely on pensions. However, the government said that, following a consultation, it now intended to set up a single body. It will provide debt advice and help with pensions, advise people on how to avoid falling victim to scams and coordinate financial education programmes for children and young people. However, this new organisation will not come into being until autumn 2018 at the earliest and the three bodies will continue to operate until then.

This demonstrated that untargeted advertising was ineffective in raising brand awareness and helping people access services, so it was vital that the new organisation had a website that was well optimised for search engines.

The three existing services are funded by levies on the financial services and pensions industries and it is planned that this will continue.

      "bodyText": "It is no surprise that the Irish government is kicking back hard against a Brussels finding that it gave Apple up to \u20ac13bn (\u00a310.8bn) in illegal state aid via a secret, sweetheart tax deal spanning many years. These are the kind of deals, after all, that have become the lifeblood of Ireland\u2019s economy over the past three decades. Inward investment has flowed as the country set out its stall as the go-to place for multinationals looking for loopholes that allow them to spirit their taxable profits off to tax havens in the Caribbean and elsewhere. In August, however, the party abruptly stalled. The European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, announced a record-breaking state aid decision in relation to Apple. It must now pay an enormous bill for back taxes. Some in Ireland had initially suggested a massive, unexpected windfall was nothing to complain about. But the finance minister, Michael Noonan, was quick to put them straight. \u201cTo do anything [other than appeal against the Brussels decision] would be like eating the seed potatoes and destroying the future for people for short-term advantage now,\u201d he said. On Monday he unveiled details of Ireland\u2019s appeal, sent to the EU courts in Luxembourg last month. In a nutshell, Noonan simply refuses to accept that Apple\u2019s corporate arrangements in Cork, which have regularly generated two-thirds of the global profits for the US company, have been in any way exceptional. Nor is it at all odd that these handful of Cork-registered companies have been able to claim \u201cstateless\u201d income \u2013 that is, their profits are beyond the jurisdiction of any state to tax. Apple is expected to take a similar line when it lodges its own appeal: that no rules have been broken, and that the company is the victim of a political attack that retrospectively and unreasonably unpicks tax treatments which have endured for decades without objection. Having come so far, and with so much at stake, it is hard to imagine Apple and Ireland throwing in the towel and conceding in the EU courts. That said, with each fresh round of public disclosures about the iPhone maker\u2019s tax structure, it looks more and more indefensible on any measure. At this rate, US critics of Vestager\u2019s meddling may well have cause to reassess. Instead of calling the commissioner out for overreaching her powers, they may instead question the inaction of the Inland Revenue Service. Why is it, after all that the IRS is pursuing Amazon and Facebook through the US courts over their European tax structures, but have never challenged Apple?",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ireland may never see the full \u20ac13bn (\u00a310.8bn) in unpaid taxes owed by Apple, the European commission has said, if other EU countries go after the American tech giant for a share. The EU executive also said Apple could reduce its multibillion-euro tax bill to Ireland if it increased payments to its US parent company, as it revealed the full text of its landmark ruling against the US tech giant for the first time. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, suggested Ireland may not see the full \u20ac13bn in back taxes if Apple chose to pay larger amounts to its US headquarters to fund research and development. Speaking to the Irish Independent, she said the total paid to Ireland could be reduced because other EU member states may demand more tax from Apple if they concluded that the US tech firm had underpaid them, because it had been routing profits to Apple\u2019s Irish headquarters in Cork. The full text of the EU\u2019s decision, published on Monday, sets the stage for a titanic legal battle, which pits the European commission against Apple and Dublin, with implications for hundreds of companies. In August, the commission said a sweetheart deal devised by the Irish government had allowed Apple to pay tax of just 0.005% in 2014 and an average rate of 1% over many years. Speaking on Monday, Vestager said the full amount may not be payable to Ireland. Apple created two companies in Ireland, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, as it went on a journey to become the biggest profit-making firm in the world. \u201cThe amount to be paid back to Ireland would also be reduced if the two companies were required to pay larger amounts of money to their US parent company to fund the research and development efforts,\u201d Vestager said. However, she also suggested other EU member states may want a slice. \u201cOther countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation. If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland,\u201d she said. Earlier in the year, the Danish politician said Ireland had given Apple a sweetheart deal worth \u20ac13bn. But the full 130-page ruling was only published on Monday, to allow lawyers to ensure confidential commercial information was kept out of the final report. Hours ahead of publication, Dublin and Apple stepped up their war of words, vowing to fight the commission in court. As it announced plans to lodge its appeal this week, Apple accused European regulators of a political crusade against a successful American company. In a personal attack on the Danish competition commissioner, a senior company executive said Apple was a convenient target for an official chasing headlines. The company\u2019s chief general counsel, Bruce Sewell, told Reuters: \u201cApple is not an outlier in any sense that matters to the law. Apple is a convenient target because it generates lots of headlines. It allows the commissioner to become Dane of the year for 2016,\u201d he said, referring to the title accorded by Danish newspaper Berlingske last month. Under Vestager, the commission has also taken on McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks and Italy\u2019s Fiat over tax, and launched investigations into overcharging by Gazprom, one of Russia\u2019s most powerful companies. In a submission to Europe\u2019s second-highest court, Apple also accused the commission of ignoring Ireland\u2019s tax experts. \u201cThe Irish have put in an expert opinion from an incredibly well-respected Irish tax lawyer,\u201d Sewell said. \u201cThe commission not only didn\u2019t attack that \u2013 didn\u2019t argue with it, as far as we know \u2013 they probably didn\u2019t even read it. Because there is no reference [in the EU decision] whatsoever.\u201d Apple\u2019s combatative stance comes as no surprise \u2013 earlier in the year, the Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, dismissed the case as \u201ctotal political crap\u201d. Apple has already agreed to pay \u20ac318m to the Italian authorities to settle a case of suspected fraud, where it failed to declare its earnings between 2008 and 2013. Ireland is expected to create a \u20ac13bn escrow account to store the money, pending potential claims by other member states. Only national tax authorities can decide whether they wish to pursue Apple for taxes on profits booked in Ireland. While Brussels is confident it will win its case, the Irish government accused the commission of riding roughshod over Ireland\u2019s sovereignty, by trying to rewrite the country\u2019s corporation tax rules. Unveiling its formal legal submission on Monday, the finance department described how low taxes are the point of its sales pitch to foreign investors, arguing it was perfectly legal to levy far less tax on profits than imposed by competitors. Under EU rules, governments have powers to set their own corporate tax rates, but are forbidden from giving an unfair competitive advantage to firms on their territory. Ireland levies a tax rate of 12.5%, one of the lowest in the EU, nearly a third of the US rate of 35%. Irish ministers have stressed its low corporate tax rate is non-negotiable, viewing it as the linchpin of the economy. The low headline rate, combined with complex use of shell companies, has helped Ireland to draw in scores of tech and pharmaceutical firms. Apple employs 6,000 people in Cork, Ireland\u2019s second city, and has pledged to remain loyal to the city it chose as its European base more than 30 years ago. Ireland\u2019s finance ministry contended that the commission had misunderstood EU competition rules, which are intended to ensure a level-playing field across the union. \u201cThe state aid rules by their nature cannot remedy mismatches between tax systems on a global level,\u201d it said, contesting the EU\u2019s argument that Apple got benefits denied to other companies based in Ireland. Vestager made clear the commission was standing its ground: \u201cThis decision sends a clear message: member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies. No matter if they are European or foreign, large or small, part of a group or not.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The banking sector is to face fresh scrutiny from MPs, who are embarking on a new inquiry to examine rules put in place after the financial crisis in 2008 to prevent further billion-pound taxpayer bailouts. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said the public had a right to know if they were protected from a repeat of the financial crisis, when \u00a365bn was pumped into Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. \u201cThe public was forced to foot the bill \u2013 and a large one \u2013 when the banks got into trouble during the crisis. They are still footing the bill now, with the profitable disposal of RBS looking like an ever more distant prospect,\u201d said Tyrie. Last month, RBS failed the Bank of England\u2019s stress test \u2013 an annual health check of the sector introduced after the crisis \u2013 in a move exacerbating the problems facing Philip Hammond in reducing the taxpayer stake below 73%. The chancellor said in October that a sale of any more shares in RBS was not practical after his predecessor George Osborne sold off a 5% stake at a \u00a31bn loss in August 2015. As he launched a call for evidence by 5 March, Tyrie said: \u201cEight years on from the crisis, a great deal of effort has gone into ending \u2018too big to fail\u2019.\u201d Among regulator efforts to make banks safer were new rules to force them to hold more capital, to outline how they could be broken up in the event of collapse, and the ringfencing requirement devised by Sir John Vickers to protect high street operations from investment banking businesses. The financial crisis showed that banks were not holding enough capital to cushion them against the risks they were running. When they needed more funds, it was taxpayers, not investors, who footed the bill. \u201cThe public have a right to know whether they are now adequately protected,\u201d said Tyrie. \u201cRingfencing and resolution regimes are intended to ensure that the failure of large banks can be managed in an orderly way, without relying on public support. It is vital to establish how robust they are.\u201d Tyrie also chaired the parliamentary commission on banking standards, which was instigated after the Libor-rigging scandal and looked at the way taxpayers stepped into rescue ailing banks. \u201cAs the parliamentary commission on banking standards concluded, the assumption that failing banks would receive public support was part of a toxic cocktail of misaligned incentives which contributed to the financial crisis,\u201d he said. The EU has also implemented rules that require bondholders to take losses in collapsing banks before taxpayers can pump in funds. Among the questions posed by the Treasury select committee in its terms of reference, is the impact of Brexit, if any, on the UK\u2019s regime for handling troubled banks and how far advanced are UK banks in meeting current rules. The Vickers rules, for instance, need to be implemented by the start of 2019. The British Bankers\u2019 Association backed the latest inquiry. \u201cThe UK taxpayer should never again have to foot the bill when a financial institution finds itself in difficulty. The BBA therefore welcomes the Treasury committee\u2019s inquiry into capital and resolution and looks forward to contributing to it,\u201d a spokesperson for the lobby group said.",

      "bodyText": "Over in Greece the government is once again denying any suggestion that elections are on the horizon despite mounting speculation that a national ballot may soon be inevitable. Helena Smith reports: Greece\u2019s latest standoff with creditors has sparked widespread conjecture that early elections are not far off. Lenders\u2019 demands for additional austerity beyond 2018, when the country\u2019s current bailout programme ends, has put Athens\u2019 leftist-led government increasingly on the defensive. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 surprise announcement of fiscal support for vulnerable groups appears only to have toughened the hard line approach with the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone\u2019s financing arm abruptly freezing short-term debt relief measures last week. Senior cadres in the ruling Syriza party say they are now being told that unless \u20ac4.5 bn worth of extra measures in the form of pension and tax reforms are legislated, a crucial second review of the economy will be delayed. That could once again raise the spectre of Greece\u2019s ejection from the eurozone. Earlier today the credit ratings agency, Moody\u2019s, said it would increase the risk of Greece defaulting on bond payments in July. \u201cWe are being blackmailed,\u201d said one. \u201cWe have accepted reforms that ideologically have been very difficult to swallow. Asking us to vote through more is democratically unacceptable.\u201d With the two-party government\u2019s wafer thin majority of 153 in the 300-seat house it was far from sure that further belt-tightening could be endorsed. Approval ratings of Syriza and Tsipras have plummeted precipitously on the back of fury over unpopular reforms. \u201cEarly elections are not part of our plans,\u201d the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said. \u201cIn 2018 Greece will exit the memoranda and [international] supervision,\u201d he said referring to the latest bailout programme. \u201cEven if the review is delayed we will not have elections. The country does not need elections.\u201d On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The US economy continues to perform reasonably despite signs of a slowdown between November and December. The initial Markit services purchasing managers index for December came in at 53.4, down from a final figure of 54.6 in November. The composite index came in at 53.5 in December compared to 54.9 the previous month. Here\u2019s our report on the Christine Lagarde guilty verdict. Kim Willsher reports: Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has been found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayers\u2019 money to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie, but avoided a jail sentence. A French court convicted the former government minister, who had faced a \u20ac15,000 fine and up to a year in jail, but decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. The verdict came as a surprise as even the public prosecutor had admitted the evidence against Lagarde was \u201cweak\u201d during a five day trial last week. Jean-Claude Marin told the court Lagarde\u2019s actions fell into the category of politics and not criminality and called for her to be acquitted. Lagarde, who has always argued she did nothing wrong and acted \u201cin the public interest\u201d, was not present for the judgment. Her lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said she had flown back to Washington DC, where the IMF is based. Lagarde had appeared before the Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique, a special tribunal set up to judge ministers and public officials for alleged crimes committed while in office. It is made up of three judges and 12 politicians from the French houses of parliament. It was only the fifth time the court had sat and its judgements cannot be appealed against. The full story is here: The prospect of 20,000 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged a little closer after it moved higher at the start of trading. The index is currently up 36 points at 19,880, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are both marginally higher. Elsewhere: Reports that the German bank would have to pay that much spooked investors back in September. The IMF board is meeting shortly to discuss the Christine Lagarde situation. Gerry Rice, the fund\u2019s director of communications, said: The Executive Board has met on previous occasions to consider developments related to the legal proceedings in France. It is expected that the Board will meet again shortly to consider the most recent developments. Here\u2019s AP on the Lagarde news: A special French court has declared International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde guilty of criminal negligence in a long-running arbitration case. But the court decided not to punish her or give her a criminal record. The Court of Justice of the Republic ruled that her negligence while servicing as finance minister allowed for the misappropriation of funds by other people. The others, in a separate case, haven\u2019t yet been tried. International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde has been convicted on one count of negligence by a French court, Bloomberg is reporting. Lagarde was accused of failing to prevent a government payout to businessman Bernard Tapie when she was French finance minister eight years ago. Uh oh. There could be a spanner in the works of the Monte dei Paschi fundraising. Reuters reports: Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena is trying to resolve differences with a key investor over its 5 billion euro ($5.2 billion) rescue plan to allow the deal to go ahead and avoid a state bailout. Italy\u2019s third-largest bank has until the end of December to raise capital and offload 28 billion euros in gross bad loans as requested by European Central Bank supervisors. Monte dei Paschi has failed to find buyers for its shares so far. On Monday, it shook the market again with a warning that Italian bank industry bailout fund Atlante was rethinking its 1.5 billion euro purchase of bad loans from the lender. Atlante had expressed \u201cdeep reservations\u201d in a Dec. 17 letter over the terms of a bridge loan that Monte dei Paschi had secured as part of the sale of bad loans, the bank said. Monte dei Paschi shares extended losses on the news, erasing a week\u2019s gains to trade down 7.7 percent at 19.3 euros each. \u201cIf issues raised by (Atlante\u2019s manager) Quaestio cannot be solved, the operation could not be concluded by Dec. 31, 2016 as requested by the European Central Bank,\u201d the bank said in a statement. However, Carlo Messina, chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Atlante\u2019s top contributors, said he believed the investment fund should go ahead with the deal and that it would reach a decision by Tuesday at the latest. Italy is ready to bail out Monte dei Paschi, the world\u2019s oldest bank,to prevent it being wound down and destabilising the euro zone\u2019s fourth-largest banking sector. Time for an update on the markets, and it\u2019s an uncertain pattern. Most European markets are still marginally lower, although off their worst levels, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.3% despite the fall in Monte dei Paschi as the bank starts its \u20ac5bn refinancing. The FTSE 100 has also edged higher - just - up 0.09%. But France\u2019s Cac is 0.26% lower, Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.03% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is down 0.66% Meanwhile with the strength of the dollar continuing in the wake of last week\u2019s rate rise from the US Federal Reserve, the pound fell around 1% to its lowest level for a month, although it has recovered a little ground and is now down 0.75% at \u00a31.2394. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.5% at \u20ac1.1882. Tomorrow could see more developments in the row between Greek and its lenders over the government\u2019s plan to pay pensioners a Christmas bonus, something which was not approved by the lenders. Greece\u2019s Kathimerini reports: The Euro Working Group (EWG) is to meet Tuesday to discuss the impact on the Greek program of the SYRIZA-led government\u2019s decision to grant a one-off supplement to pensioners. The European Stability Mechanism reacted to the measure by suspending for the time being the implementation of the short-term debt relief measures that were only rubber stamped by eurozone finance ministers on December 5. EWG is expected to discuss a report by representatives of the institutions on the actual cost of the handout. The report was requested by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. Clemens Fuest, the president of Germany\u2019s IFO institute, has told Bloomberg that current interest rates may be too low for the eurozone. He presumably then welcomes signs of inflationary pressures in the latest wages data. The International Monetary Fund is positive about the actions taken by Ukraine over its biggest lender, PrivatBank. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, who also has other things on her mind at the moment, said: Today\u2019s decision of Ukrainian authorities to nationalize PrivatBank is an important step in their efforts to safeguard financial stability. This decision was taken to ensure the smooth operations of the bank given its systemic role in Ukraine\u2019s financial system, and in view of insufficient efforts to strengthen its capital adequacy in recent months... It is now important that the process of nationalisation be followed by firm efforts to maximise the repayment of related-party loans, and the appointment of an independent management team to restore the bank\u2019s viability, minimising the cost to the state and taxpayers in line with existing legislation and international best practice. The IMF will continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to build strong institutions, enhance transparency, and advance structural reforms which are critical to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth. And in Italy: The details of the European Union\u2019s decision against Apple in a dispute over the tax it pays to Ireland have been released. Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels: Apple could reduce its \u20ac13bn (\u00a310.8bn) tax bill to Ireland if it increased payments to its US parent company or paid back taxes to other EU countries, the European commission has said, as it revealed the full text of its landmark ruling against the US tech giant for the first time. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, suggested Ireland may not see the full \u20ac13bn in back taxes, if Apple chose to pay larger amounts to its US headquarters to fund research and development. Speaking to the Irish Independent, she also said the total paid to Ireland could be reduced because other EU member states may demand more tax from Apple if they concluded that the US tech firm had underpaid them, because it had been routing profits to Apple\u2019s Irish headquarters in Cork. The full text of the EU\u2019s decision, published on Monday, sets the stage for a titanic legal battle, which pits the European commission against Apple and Dublin, with implications for hundreds of companies. In August, the commission said a sweetheart deal devised by the Irish government had allowed Apple to pay tax of just 0.005% in 2014 and an average rate of 1% over many years. The UK Competition and Markets Authority will investigate the secondary ticketing market. It said: The CMA has today launched an enforcement investigation into suspected breaches of consumer protection law in the online secondary tickets market. This follows concerns that people are not getting the full range of information required by law when buying tickets put up for resale. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will specifically look at if information is provided on who the seller is and any connections the seller may have with the platform or event organisers; whether there are any restrictions on the use of resold tickets which could result in the person being denied access to the event; and where a seat is located in the venue. Andrea Coscelli, CMA Acting Chief Executive, said: \u201cA night out at a concert or a trip to a big match is something that millions of people look forward to. So it\u2019s important they know who they are buying from and whether there are any restrictions that could stop them using the ticket. \u201cWe have heard concerns about a lack of transparency over who is buying up tickets from the primary market. We also think that it is essential that those consumers who buy tickets from the secondary market are made aware if there is a risk that they will be turned away at the door.\u201d Meanwhile eurozone construction activity was also on the rise: Annual growth in hourly eurozone wages rose 1.6% in the third quarter, compared to an increase of just 0.9% in the previous three months and 1.7% in the first quarter. Hourly labour costs - which include wages and non-wage costs - rose by 1.5% in the eurozone and by 1.9% in the wider 28 member European Union in the third quarter of 2016, compared with the same quarter of the previous year. Report compiler Eurostat said: The two main components of labour costs are wages &amp; salaries and non-wage costs. In the euro area, wages &amp; salaries per hour worked grew by 1.6% and the non-wage component by 1.2% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the same quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, the annual changes were +0.9% and +1.5% respectively. In the EU28, hourly wages &amp; salaries rose by 2.0% and the non-wage component by 1.5% in the third quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, annual changes were +1.4% and +1.7% respectively. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit, said the data could be encouraging for the European Central Bank: A rise in Eurozone wage costs and total labour costs in the third quarter of 2016 may fuel hope within the ECB that underlying Eurozone inflationary pressures may just be starting to pick up. The ECB has been frustrated and disappointed by the lack of a pick-up in underlying Eurozone in recent months, even though the headline consumer price inflation rate has picked up... However, while the ECB may well take some comfort from the third-quarter Eurozone labour costs and wage data, the Governing Council will still be wary about the current weakness of underlying price pressures \u2013 the ECB will likely note that while annual growth in Eurozone total labour costs and wages both picked up in the third quarter, this followed a sharp relapse in the second quarter and both were still just below the levels seen in the first quarter. Over to Greece, and this: If the festive mood in the German economy is not enough for you, then head over to our Christmas quiz for a bit more seasonal cheer. 44 out of 50 is the score to beat in my case (which is less impressive than it sounds given I wrote four of the questions.....) Economists have mixed views on what the December German IFO index portends for 2017: But economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank is less sanguine: Germany\u2019s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, closes the year with another improvement. The Ifo index increased to 110.0 in December, from 110.4 in November. The increase was mainly driven by a better current assessment component (116.6, from 115.6). The expectations component remained almost unchanged. The December increase suggests that German businesses are not (yet) afraid of negative economic implications from the new president in the US. Today\u2019s Ifo was the last important macro indicator for the German economy this year. As always, the upcoming Christmas break is a good occasion for a reflective moment. A look at the German economy through the rear mirror. A look which shows an impressive, though slightly slowing growth performance. The German economy has continued its recovery and defied many external risks and turmoil, like Chinese stock market turbulences and economic slowdown, low oil prices, Brexit and continued weakness in many Eurozone countries. The key for economic success has been domestic demand. Strong domestic demand on the back of a strong labour market, low inflation, low interest rates and higher wages, partly fueled by the ECB and refugees. Unfortunately, as with so many good things, the current positive growth cycle is also coming to an end. Gradually, not abruptly. Looking into 2017, the upside for the German economy is that the main growth drivers of 2016 should still be the main growth drivers of 2017, only weaker. Construction, the best-performing sector currently, should continue to benefit from low interest rates and excess demand for housing in urban areas. Consumption should continue to thrive on the back of the strong labour market, higher real wages and low interest rates. Finally, government consumption should remain high as the influx of refugees requires continued expenditure. However, these three drivers are unlikely to gain momentum as interest rates are unlikely to drop further, inflation is gradually moving upwards and the labour market has reached its natural rate of unemployment. Real risks to the German outlook mainly seem to stem from the outside. The still unknown impact from president-elect Trump on trade and economic policies, the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and renewed political tensions in Europe due to several elections or a new flaring up of the Greek crisis are in our view the biggest risks for 2017. On top of everything, national elections in Germany do not pose a risk in itself but should clearly absorb time that could be used to implement new reforms and investments. All in all, it very much looks as if 2017 could be the slimmed down version of 2016. The growth ingredients should remain the same but it will be a bit less of everything. A good recipe to lose some weight after the holidays but not the best recipe for more economic growth. The German economy is in a festive mood, according to Clemens Fuest the president of the IFO institute. He said: The German economy is making a strong finish to the year. In the manufacturing sector, the index rose. Assessments of both the current business situation and expectations improved. Demand picked up significantly and the order back log grew. More companies plan to ramp up production in the months ahead as a result. In wholesaling, the business climate index rose to its highest level in almost three years. This was primarily due to more favourable assessments of the business situation. Wholesalers, however, scaled back their optimistic expectations slightly. In retailing the index remained unchanged at a high level. While retailers assessed their current business situation slightly less favourably, their business expectations improved. Electrical goods retailers reported brisk Christmas business. The construction sector continues to break records. Since Germany\u2019s reunification business has never been better for contractors. Improved business expectations indicate that the boom will continue in the months ahead. But it was not so joyous in the service sector: In the service sector the mood deteriorated in the run-up to Christmas. The indicator fell to 31.7 balance points in December from 35.0 balance points in November. Service providers assessed their current business situation less favourably. They also scaled back their business expectations slightly. Both indices, however, are significantly above their long-term average. Service providers remain keen to recruit additional staff. German business confidence improved in December, with the IFO index rising to 111 much as expected: Ukraine\u2019s largest lender has been declared insolvent, with the country\u2019s central bank saying that nationalisation was the best way forward. Reuters reports: Ukraine declared the country\u2019s largest lender PrivatBank insolvent on Monday and said bringing it under state ownership was the only way to protect the money of 20 million Ukrainian clients and stave off threats to the financial system. The central bank said in a statement that PrivatBank had not fulfilled its recapitalisation programme and 97 percent of its corporate loans had gone to companies linked to the bank\u2019s shareholders. As of Dec. 1, the bank\u2019s capital shortfall stood at 148 billion hryvnia ($5.65 billion). \u201cWe are sure that moving the bank into state ownership is the only possible way to save the money of the bank\u2019s clients and to save the financial system,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. The central bank said that Ukraine was ready to support PrivatBank with liquidity if needed, adding that it did not see the nationalisation process as significantly impacting the currency market or inflation levels. PrivatBank\u2019s former shareholders had agreed to restructure loans paid to insiders by July 1 next year, the central bank said, while the finance minister said the bank would be sold once it was back on its feet. Under Western-backed banking reforms, Ukraine is meant to shut lenders that cannot meet capitalisation targets, but PrivatBank is considered too big to fail. The nationalisation comes just days before parliament has to vote on next year\u2019s budget, which must stick to a shortfall of 3 percent of economic output, as agreed with Ukraine\u2019s international backers. Meanwhile the Ukrainian president said the state assured PrivatBank\u2019s clients that their money was safe, and called for people to remain calm. Over in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi have opened and are down 8.5%, triggering another suspension. The Santa rally in markets that we have seen since the start of December appears to be running out of steam a little. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It may be the start of the final week before Christmas, but so far the European markets are looking rather Santa-less this Monday. To be fair, the FTSE has actually had a rather impressive December already, finally climbing back above 7000 last Friday, so it can be forgiven for not drastically building on that level this morning. The index is still flirting with that landmark level, though currently it lacks the kind of momentum that could lead it to a fresh all-time high later in the day. As for the pound, it\u2019s still struggling below 1.25 against the dollar, while against the dollar it has shed 0.2%. Over in the Eurozone the situation was similar, with the DAX and CAC both dipping after the bell. Like the FTSE the German and French indices have had a very strong December; the DAX, for example, has risen around 800 points since the start of the month, in part thanks to the ECB\u2019s (sort of) QE boost in its most recent meeting. Defying expectations, stock markets have started the last trading week before Christmas on the back foot. The FTSE 100 has fallen around12 points or 0.18% while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac have lost 0.2%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has opened down 0.3%. Mining and financial stocks are proving a drag in early trading, with Italy\u2019s Monte de Paschi failing to open but called lower on news of its plans to launch a \u20ac5bn cash call in a last ditch effort to avoid a state bailout. The bank said on Sunday its offer to institutional investors, who account for 65% of the total, would be open until 1pm GMT on Thursday. The offer to retail investors would close a day earlier. Here\u2019s Unicredit\u2019s forecast for the German IFO business confidence index, due in an hour or so: \u201cWe expect the Ifo climate index to improve to 111.0 in December after the stabilization at 110.4 in November.\u201d And Mike van Dulken and Henry Croft at Accendo Markets said: On a quiet day for macro data, in focus today will be German December IFO Surveys, all expected to show slight improvement since November with the Business Climate figure attempting to post a fresh 2016 high (albeit by a very slim margin). These figures have obvious importance for the Eurozone given Germany\u2019s position as the powerhouse for the European economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the last trading week before Christmas, and many investors are already winding down for the festive season. But with thin trading volumes in the markets, there might be some volatile moves to look out for. Will the FTSE 100 hit a new peak, beating the closing high of 7103 reached in April 2015 or the record intra-day level of 7129 in October this year? Will the Dow pass the key 20,000 barrier. On the agenda come German confidence figures and US services and composite PMI numbers, and ahead of that European markets are expected to open higher: We\u2019ll also be keeping an eye on struggling Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which is attempting to refinance its huge debts, and could affect the general direction of the markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: As we head into the final full trading week of 2016, having come off a decent December so far for European stocks which have seen a number of significant breakouts, the key question as we head into year-end is whether these gains of the past two weeks are likely to be sustained. Initial impressions look positive, however the elephant in the room remains the Italian banking sector after last week\u2019s announcement by Italy\u2019s largest bank Unicredit to draw a line under its recent problems by announcing a significant recapitalisation plan. This week all eyes will return to Monte dei Paschi di Siena who are expected to launch their plans to sell \u20ac5bn of stock in the days leading up to Christmas to institutions and retail investors, in the hope that over \u20ac25bn of bad loans can then be sold on, and the bank rescued without having to bail in retail bondholders. While the political picture at the top of Italian government has become a little clearer there is no reason that this particular attempted restructuring package is likely to be any more successful than the previous three, given the continued weakness of the Italian economy, which is probably why so far there has been so little investor interest. There may also be developments in the Greek crisis, after lenders objected to the government\u2019s plans to give Christmas bonuses to pensioners.",

Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Greece\u2019s latest standoff with creditors has sparked widespread conjecture that early elections are not far off. Lenders\u2019 demands for additional austerity beyond 2018, when the country\u2019s current bailout programme ends, has put Athens\u2019 leftist-led government increasingly on the defensive. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 surprise announcement of fiscal support for vulnerable groups appears only to have toughened the hard line approach with the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone\u2019s financing arm abruptly freezing short-term debt relief measures last week.</p> <p>Senior cadres in the ruling Syriza party say they are now being told that unless \u20ac4.5 bn worth of extra measures in the form of pension and tax reforms are legislated, a crucial second review of the economy will be delayed. That could once again raise the spectre of Greece\u2019s ejection from the eurozone. Earlier today the credit ratings agency, Moody\u2019s, said it would increase the risk of Greece defaulting on bond payments in July. </p> <p>\u201cWe are being blackmailed,\u201d said one. \u201cWe have accepted reforms that ideologically have been very difficult to swallow. Asking us to vote through more is democratically unacceptable.\u201d </p> <p>With the two-party government\u2019s wafer thin majority of 153 in the 300-seat house it was far from sure that further belt-tightening could be endorsed. Approval ratings of Syriza and Tsipras have plummeted precipitously on the back of fury over unpopular reforms. </p> <p>\u201cEarly elections are not part of our plans,\u201d the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said. \u201cIn 2018 Greece will exit the memoranda and [international] supervision,\u201d he said referring to the latest bailout programme. \u201cEven if the review is delayed we will not have elections.

The Ifo index increased to 110.0 in December, from 110.4 in November. The increase was mainly driven by a better current assessment component (116.6, from 115.6). The expectations component remained almost unchanged. The December increase suggests that German businesses are not (yet) afraid of negative economic implications from the new president in the US.</p> <p>Today\u2019s Ifo was the last important macro indicator for the German economy this year. As always, the upcoming Christmas break is a good occasion for a reflective moment. A look at the German economy through the rear mirror. A look which shows an impressive, though slightly slowing growth performance. The German economy has continued its recovery and defied many external risks and turmoil, like Chinese stock market turbulences and economic slowdown, low oil prices, Brexit and continued weakness in many Eurozone countries. The key for economic success has been domestic demand. Strong domestic demand on the back of a strong labour market, low inflation, low interest rates and higher wages, partly fueled by the ECB and refugees.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as with so many good things, the current positive growth cycle is also coming to an end. Gradually, not abruptly. Looking into 2017, the upside for the German economy is that the main growth drivers of 2016 should still be the main growth drivers of 2017, only weaker. Construction, the best-performing sector currently, should continue to benefit from low interest rates and excess demand for housing in urban areas. Consumption should continue to thrive on the back of the strong labour market, higher real wages and low interest rates. Finally, government consumption should remain high as the influx of refugees requires continued expenditure. However, these three drivers are unlikely to gain momentum as interest rates are unlikely to drop further, inflation is gradually moving upwards and the labour market has reached its natural rate of unemployment.</p> <p>Real risks to the German outlook mainly seem to stem from the outside. The still unknown impact from president-elect Trump on trade and economic policies, the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and renewed political tensions in Europe due to several elections or a new flaring up of the Greek crisis are in our view the biggest risks for 2017. On top of everything, national elections in Germany do not pose a risk in itself but should clearly absorb time that could be used to implement new reforms and investments.</p> <p>All in all, it very much looks as if 2017 could be the slimmed down version of 2016. The growth ingredients should remain the same but it will be a bit less of everything. A good recipe to lose some weight after the holidays but not the best recipe for more economic growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5857a9a5e4b0525ea8569da1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-19T09:42:03.404Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/Survey-Results/Business-Climate/Geschaeftsklima-Archiv/2016/Geschaeftsklima-20161219.html\">The German economy is in a festive mood</a></strong>, according to Clemens Fuest the president of the IFO institute. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The German economy is making a strong finish to the year.</p> <p>In the manufacturing sector, the index rose. Assessments of both the current business situation and expectations improved. Demand picked up significantly and the order back log grew. More companies plan to ramp up production in the months ahead as a result. </p> <p>In wholesaling, the business climate index rose to its highest level in almost three years. This was primarily due to more favourable assessments of the business situation. Wholesalers, however, scaled back their optimistic expectations slightly. In retailing the index remained unchanged at a high level. While retailers assessed their current business situation slightly less favourably, their business expectations improved. Electrical goods retailers reported brisk Christmas business. </p> <p>The construction sector continues to break records. Since Germany\u2019s reunification business has never been better for contractors. Improved business expectations indicate that the boom will continue in the months ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it was not so joyous in the service sector:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the service sector the mood deteriorated in the run-up to Christmas. The indicator fell to 31.7 balance points in December from 35.0 balance points in November. Service providers assessed their current business situation less favourably. They also scaled back their business expectations slightly. Both indices, however, are significantly above their long-term average. Service providers remain keen to recruit additional staff. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72db10ea0f1335391e4e10c2c16c2c387a19dd42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72db10ea0f1335391e4e10c2c16c2c387a19dd42/0_0_1092_729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"IFO business survey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">IFO business survey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFO business survey</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-19T10:06:19.887Z\">at 10.06am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5857a27ce4b0010b9dd832a2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-19T09:04:53.229Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German business confidence rises</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>German business confidence improved in December, with the IFO index rising to 111 much as expected:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/810771834484428800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Germany?src=hash\">#Germany</a> Ifo Business Climate at 111  <a href=\"https://t.co/B5HWHFBYiu\">https://t.co/B5HWHFBYiu</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sKuq73z2By\">pic.twitter.com/sKuq73z2By</a></p>&mdash; Trading Economics (@tEconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/810771834484428800\">December 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconEurope/status/810773075574816768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">German Ifo a touch strong than expected in December and is consistent with a pick up in annual GDP growth from Q3&#39;s 1.7% to around 2.5% <a href=\"https://t.co/6zklDAUiuK\">pic.twitter.com/6zklDAUiuK</a></p>&mdash; Capital Economics (@CapEconEurope) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconEurope/status/810773075574816768\">December 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-19T09:09:41.276Z\">at 9.09am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58579a62e4b0010b9dd8327f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-19T08:42:24.833Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ukraine's largest bank set to be nationalised</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ukraine\u2019s largest lender has been declared insolvent, with the country\u2019s central bank saying that nationalisation was the best way forward.

The savings are part of a list unveiled on Monday in the latest midyear economic forecast, which, as expected, axed another Abbott-era initiative, the \u201cgreen army\u201d program, and also the \u201casset recycling\u201d initiative, which was a major economic program unveiled in the Abbott government\u2019s first budget to encourage the states to privatise assets. The new economic statement also reveals the government is planning to save more than $7bn in payments relating to childcare benefits and rebates over the next four years compared with previous projections \u2013 although the number of children accessing subsidised childcare is forecast to grow. The government in its explanation of the marriage equality plebiscite saving has moved to reassure conservatives that the idea has only been shelved, not canned. The midyear economic forecast says the government will book the marriage equality plebiscite as a saving but \u201cif the parliament passes legislation for a plebiscite on same-sex marriage in the future, the government will allocate the necessary funding at that point\u201d. Abbott\u2019s nannies pilot program \u2013 which was a key part of his political pitch on childcare in opposition and in government \u2013 has been canned effective 30 June 2018 on the basis take-up was \u201cmuch lower\u201d than expected. The pilot will be closed to new applicants from 1 January 2017 and families already participating in the scheme will have their care subsidised until June 2018. The government also used the update forecast to dump a controversial plan to sell the Australian Securities and Investments Commission corporate registry to a private company. The Australian Council of Social Service, the Tax Justice Network, the Uniting church and GetUp, among other groups, had urged the government to desist from the sale. On Monday the government said it decided not to proceed with the sale because the final bids received \u201cdid not deliver a net financial benefit for the commonwealth\u201d. Not proceeding with the initiative will return $4.5m to the budget. The government has also nipped the youth internship program it unveiled in May, taking $5.7m out of the Youth Jobs PaTH program \u2013 at the same time setting aside $20m over four years for an \u201cawareness strategy\u201d for that and other youth employment programs.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deficits have increased over the forward estimates by $10.3bn in the latest midyear economic forecast (Myefo) as weaker wages growth and profits growth have hit revenue collections. In news which has not entirely reassured the ratings agencies currently considering cutting Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating, the deficit position has deteriorated over the four-year forward estimates when compared with the May budget projections, with revenue collections down by more than $30bn. S&amp;P Global Ratings said the new economic forecast prompted no \u201cimmediate effect\u201d on Australia\u2019s prized AAA rating, but it said the new mid-year outlook confirmed a worsening fiscal position which \u201cfurther pressures the rating.\u201d \u201cWe remain pessimistic about the government\u2019s ability to close existing budget deficits and return a balanced budget by the year ending June 30, 2021,\u201d S&amp;P said. \u201cOver the coming months, we will continue to monitor the government\u2019s willingness and ability to enact new budget savings or revenue measures to reduce fiscal deficits materially over the next few years.\u201d Moody\u2019s issued hedged guidance, on the one hand giving a tick to the government\u2019s actions, and saying the fiscal metrics were in line with other AAA-rated \u201csovereigns\u201d \u2013 but the agency, like S&amp;P, put a question mark over the validity of the new projections. Moody\u2019s said it expected budget deficits \u201cwill be somewhat wider for longer than currently projected\u201d and it would be \u201cchallenging\u201d to achieve the revenue collections and expenditure restraint outlined on Monday. It also noted the ongoing difficulty the government faced in the parliament by observing \u201clegislating fiscal consolidation measures remains challenging.\u201d Fitch for its part was unequivocal, saying the latest budget outlook was consistent with AAA ratings. The latest economic update from the Treasury shows the deficit is expected to narrow from $36.5bn in 2016-17 to $10bn by 2019-20. The projected return to surplus was outside the four-year estimates period, but the trajectory outlined in Monday\u2019s statement was consistent with previous Treasury forecasts. Net debt was projected to peak at 19% of gross domestic product by 2018-19. Treasury said a recent rebound in commodity prices was not sufficient to offset weaker growth in aggregate wages and non-mining profits over the four-year budget cycle. The government has for the last couple of weeks been attempting to inoculate itself politically against a potential downgrade, which would be the first since 1986, and the first downgrade delivered on a Liberal treasurer\u2019s watch. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, moved to reassure the financial markets and the ratings agencies on Monday, telling reporters the latest midyear economic forecast confirmed \u201cthe government\u2019s plan to restore the budget to balance remains on track.\u201d Morrison said the government had managed to put the budget on an improving trajectory despite it being an election year. He said the net impact of policy decisions made by the government since the last budget update, \u201cincluding fully funding all election commitments\u201d, had improved the budget bottom line by $2.5bn over the forward estimates. The treasurer said Australia\u2019s economic performance remained strong and there were reasons to be \u201cpositive and optimistic\u201d. \u201cWhen we look at particularly the issues of Australia\u2019s international standing on debt and our performance vis-a-vis other countries, with growth rates at 2%, at the top end of the scale for advanced and AAA-rated economies and an improving global outlook, as the statement sets out, and continuing evidence that the Australian economy is successfully transitioning from the mining investment boom, \u2013 there is reason to be positive and optimistic. \u201cAustralia continues to be well supported and rated by international debt markets reinforcing our global reputation and standing as a secure place to invest. The statement provides a responsible, conservative and transparent update of the Australian government\u2019s fiscal position and an optimistic but very realistic outlook on our future economic performance.\u201d Asked by reporters whether he expected a downgrade as a consequence of the new figures, and whether a downgrade would be unfair given the new forecast contained conservative projections on commodity prices, Morrison said that decision was ultimately for others, but he suggested the government believed it had done enough to produce credible and conservative economic forecasts. He said when assessing the behaviour of institutions \u201cwho actually make the purchases on Australia\u2019s debt \u2013 hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, the central banks of other countries and others \u2013 when they are making their own independent assessments of Australia, they are buying\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re buying.\u201d As expected, the new economic update confirms the government will cut Tony Abbott\u2019s \u201cgreen army\u201d program, saving the budget $224.7m over four years, although the cut is offset by spending, including the $100m for Landcare agreed with the Greens to pass the backpackers tax. The statement also pockets a substantial improvement to the debt position by closing off the asset recycling initiative \u2013 which was a program introduced in the Coalition\u2019s first budget encouraging the states to privatise government-owned assets. Shutting that program down will reduce gross debt by more than $10bn by 2019-20. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the latest economic update lacked credibility because it contained \u201czombie\u201d savings measures that had no hope of passing the parliament. Bowen said the government had declined to take up budget-improving policy proposals, such as changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax, and was persisting with tax cuts for big business that would cost the budget close to $50bn. The shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, said: \u201cScott Morrison had a choice today \u2013 he could cling to his big business tax cut, or he could cling to Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating \u2013 and not for the first time Scott Morrison made the wrong choice.\u201d",

optimistic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we look at particularly the issues of Australia\u2019s international standing on debt and our performance vis-a-vis other countries, with growth rates at 2%, at the top end of the scale for advanced and AAA-rated economies and an improving global outlook, as the statement sets out, and continuing evidence that the Australian economy is successfully transitioning from the mining investment boom, \u2013 there is reason to be positive and optimistic.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia continues to be well supported and rated by international debt markets reinforcing our global reputation and standing as a secure place to invest. The statement provides a responsible, conservative and transparent update of the Australian government\u2019s fiscal position and an optimistic but very realistic outlook on our future economic performance.\u201d</p> <p>Asked by reporters whether he expected a downgrade as a consequence of the new figures, and whether a downgrade would be unfair given the new forecast contained conservative projections on commodity prices, Morrison said that decision was ultimately for others, but he suggested the government believed it had done enough to produce credible and conservative economic forecasts.</p> <p>He said when assessing the behaviour of institutions \u201cwho actually make the purchases on Australia\u2019s debt \u2013 hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, the central banks of other countries and others \u2013 when they are making their own independent assessments of Australia, they are buying\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re buying.\u201d</p> <p>As expected, the new economic update confirms the government will cut Tony Abbott\u2019s \u201cgreen army\u201d program, saving the budget $224.7m over four years, although the cut is offset by spending, including the $100m for Landcare agreed with the Greens to pass the backpackers tax.</p> <p>The statement also pockets a substantial improvement to the debt position by closing off the asset recycling initiative \u2013 which was a program introduced in the Coalition\u2019s first budget encouraging the states to privatise government-owned assets.</p> <p>Shutting that program down will reduce gross debt by more than $10bn by 2019-20.</p> <p>The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the latest economic update lacked credibility because it contained \u201czombie\u201d savings measures that had no hope of passing the parliament.</p> <p>Bowen said the government had declined to take up budget-improving policy proposals, such as changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/17/malcolm-turnbull-interview-trump-can-boost-case-for-business-tax-cuts-in-australia\">and was persisting with tax cuts for big business</a> that would cost the budget close to $50bn.</p> <p>The shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, said: \u201cScott Morrison had a choice today \u2013 he could cling to his big business tax cut, or he could cling to Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating \u2013 and not for the first time Scott Morrison made the wrong choice.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Joe Hockey, as treasurer, delivered the Coalition\u2019s first budget in May 2014, he framed the government\u2019s policy agenda around budget deficits of $10.6bn in 2016-17 and just $2.8bn in 2017-18. The budget was to swing into surplus in 2018-19 and every year beyond that. With two-and-a-half years of Liberal\u2013National party economic policy settings since that Hockey budget, today\u2019s treasurer, Scott Morrison, has outlined the results of that plan, plus the impact of new policies and economic changes in today\u2019s midyear economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo). Morrison has confirmed that the current projections are for budget deficits of $36.5bn in 2016-17 and $28.7bn in 2017-18, meaning the 2017-18 deficit alone is some six times larger than projected by Hockey. The Hockey framework meant that Australia\u2019s sovereign triple-A credit rating was assured with all three major ratings agencies noting the fiscal trajectory and underpinnings of solid economic growth as reasons for this favourable assessment. Helping also was the projection that net government debt would peak at low level of 14.6% of GDP under the Hockey 2014 budget scenario. Alas, the strategy outlined in 2014 is in tatters. In addition to blowing the budget deficits out by tens of billions of dollars a year, Morrison has pushed out the return to surplus to 2020-21, some two years later than Hockey and is now forecasting net government debt to reach a 60-year high of 19% of GDP. Recall that 1% of GDP on 2020 dollar terms is about $20bn. The question now is not whether the ratings agencies will downgrade Australia but whether there will be numerous downgrades over the next few years. The curious thing about the debt and deficit widening of the last few years is that it has been driven by a rise in government spending together with a shortfall in revenue. Government spending as a share of GDP under the Morrison Myefo forecasts is projected to be 25.2% of GDP in both 2016-17 and 2017-18, respectively, compared with the Hockey 2014 estimates of 24.7% and 24.8%, respectively. Accordingly, government spending is an average 0.5% of GDP higher each year than projected by Hockey. At the time of the 2014 budget, government revenue as a proportion of GDP was forecast to be 24.4% in 2016-17 and 24.9% in 2017-18. The Morrison Myefo forecasts are for revenue to be 23.3% and 23.8%, respectively, a shortfall of an average 1.1% of GDP in each year. Morrison has failed to address either spending, which is significantly higher than in the 2014 budget, nor revenue, which is clearly lower. There is one other big picture issue on the economic management credentials of the Coalition government. One critical lesson from the 2008 to 2011 financial crisis is that fiscal policy can be used to manage the economic cycle \u2013 running budget deficits to support economic growth has virtues, as does tightening fiscal policy to lower the deficit, move to surplus and preserve the credit rating. It is a simple trade-off. The Coalition has neither supported growth nor repaired the budget. When Labor \u201cblew the budget deficit\u201d to above 4% of GDP during the financial crisis, they could gain comfort in the knowledge that their policy choices meant Australia avoided recession and the unemployment rate peaked at 5.9%. There were significant benefits from that particular budget deficit blowout. It should be noted that it was after these budget measures were taken that, in 2011, Australia achieved the coveted triple-A rating, with a stable outlook, from all three major ratings agencies. Now, as 2016 draws to a close, GDP growth is stalling, the unemployment rate is stuck nearer 6% than 5%, underemployment is near record highs and wages growth has fallen to a record low. These are the core reasons for the likely credit rating downgrade. Had fiscal policy been used to support growth, the ratings agencies would have seen the pro-growth strategy. Had the budget been repaired, albeit it at the cost of growth, the rating agencies would have rewarded that strategy. Blowing out the budget with falling GDP is a mark of policy ineptitude.",

Andrew Tyrie MP wrote to Ciaran Martin, head of the new cybersecurity centre of UK surveillance agency GCHQ, saying the lines of responsibility and accountability for reducing cyber-threats are opaque. Tyrie\u2019s letter to Martin, who is leading the Cheltenham-based National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), uses last month\u2019s incident at Tesco Bank to illustrate the vulnerabilities of the financial system. In November, the banking arm of supermarket chain Tesco admitted that \u00a32.5m had been stolen from 9,000 accounts in an incident which raised fresh concerns about the methods used by financial services firms to detect cyber-attacks. Two-thirds of all major UK companies \u2013 not just financial services firms \u2013 have reported security breaches in the last year. The Bank of England has also listed the threat of cyber-attacks as one of the major risks facing the financial services industry. In his letter Tyrie, a Conservative MP, outlines the responsibility for cyber-threats as being shared between the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the Financial Conduct Authority and GCHQ. In turn, the regulatory arms are responsible to the Treasury, while GCHQ reports through the foreign secretary. In light of this, Tyrie said: \u201cIt is for consideration whether a single point of responsibility for cyber risk in the financial services sector, with full ownership of \u2013 and accountability for \u2013 financial cyber-threats is now required. It may be necessary to create a line of accountability to the Treasury for financial cybercrime.\u201d Tyrie also asks Martin for clarity on the objectives of NCSC, which was set up two months ago to take charge of the UK\u2019s defences against cyber-offences. \u201cLegacy systems, human error and deliberate attack have resulted in unacceptable interruptions to vital banking services and weakened the public\u2019s confidence in the banking system as a whole. The recent attack on Tesco Bank is only the latest example of criminals exploiting vulnerabilities in the banking industry\u2019s IT systems,\u201d said Tyrie. A spokesman for the NCSC said: \u201cWe have received this letter and there will be a government response in the New Year.\u201d The parliamentary committee has been asking questions about the need for a clearer command structure to tackle cyber-attacks during its evidence sessions. Last week, Sam Woods, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor who runs PRA, was asked his views on the need for a single point of contact. Woods replied it was important to know which body was in charge of each incident rather than have the same point of contact. \u201cIt is essential that the intelligence community gives the regulators the technical and practical support they need to do their job. This means making sure that financial cybercrime has a high priority, and is not subordinate to other work,\u201d said Tyrie. \u201cCertainly, as millions of customers are exposed to the risks of cybercrime, a higher level of scrutiny and accountability for existing arrangements is needed,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s largest businesses plan to expand recruitment next year despite continuing worries over a shortage of skilled workers and the impact of Brexit. Two out of five firms will recruit more staff in 2017, according to research that also found growth in permanent jobs will outstrip temporary recruitment for the fourth year in a row. But the survey by the CBI, which covers 350 mostly large businesses, revealed that uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the European Union has shaken business confidence in the labour market. Skills shortages were said to be the biggest threat to competitiveness, with over half of those polled concerned about future access to skilled migrant workers. The survey follows a steep fall in employment growth in recent months according to official figures and concerns among economists and ministers that a squeeze on workers\u2019 incomes next year will undermine the UK\u2019s recovery. The Office for National Statistics will publish its third estimate of GDP growth in the three months to the end of September later this week, which is expected to confirm the previous figure of 0.5%, but indicate a weakening in the months ahead. Inflation has already jumped from zero to 1.2% this year and is forecast to move up to 3% or 4% by the end of 2017, while wages growth remains stuck at around 2.5%. Josh Hardie, the CBI\u2019s deputy director general, said many employers would be expanding their workforce, but with trepidation as economic uncertainty remained high. \u201cThis year\u2019s survey does show a greater sense of concern about the UK\u2019s long-term attractiveness as a place to create jobs. \u201cGetting our industrial strategy right and understanding what the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU will be will help ensure that this worry does not negatively impact the future performance of the labour market,\u201d he said. He said it was clear businesses wanted more certainty about the Brexit negotiations and what it would mean for EU staff in the UK and those they might want to attract in the future. \u201cThe government should build on the positive moves it has already made to dispel uncertainty by drawing up plans for a smooth transition, giving firms both the time to adapt to new regulations and the confidence to invest beyond 2019,\u201d he added. Carmen Watson, chairman of employment group Pertemps, which helped with the annual employment trends survey, added: \u201c2016 may have been a year of uncertainty for businesses but what we are seeing, looking ahead to 2017, is renewed optimism with employers continuing to invest in their workforces, leading to jobs growth across the UK. \u201cHowever, skills gaps remain a concern for employers as having the right people with the right skills is crucial for any organisation\u2019s performance.\u201d Almost a third of firms said they expected to create apprenticeships, while most reported positive employee relations.",
