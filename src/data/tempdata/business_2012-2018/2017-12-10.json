      "bodyText": "The EU\u2019s bank has come under fire for moves towards approving a \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.3bn) loan for a gas pipeline from Azerbaijan to western Europe as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, prepared to hosted a climate change summit in Paris. Campaigners said the European Investment Bank, which is expected to support the transadriatic pipeline (TAP) with one of its largest ever loans on Tuesday, was acting against the EU\u2019s climate change commitments. The bank has been privately urged by the EU\u2019s climate and energy chiefs to approve the loan because the project\u2019s backers \u201cneed to urgently secure adequate funding\u201d as they enter a capital-intensive construction phase. But opponents of the plan said that approving the loan on the second anniversary of the Paris climate deal being agreed would be an affront to Europe\u2019s efforts to curb carbon emissions. \u201cThe EU, which considers itself a climate action champion, simply cannot afford its financial arm, the EIB, supporting any component of the southern gas corridor,\u201d said Xavier Sol, the director of Counter Balance, an alliance of European NGOs. The timing is sensitive for Macron, who has convened a special summit in Paris on Tuesday to explore ways of financing projects to tackle climate change. The TAP is the westernmost section of the southern gas corridor, a series of pipelines transporting gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe. The Brussels-backed the project nearly a decade ago as a way of reducing the bloc\u2019s reliance on Russia, which is the biggest supplier of the EU\u2019s gas imports. The names of the energy firms behind the project have changed over the years as companies bought and sold their stakes. Today the pipeline consortium consists of BP, Azerbaijan gas firm Socar, Italy\u2019s Snam, Belgium\u2019 Fluxys, Spain\u2019s Enag\u00e1s and Switzerland\u2019s Axpo. Hundreds of miles of land have been cleared in Greece and Albania for the pipeline, and about 2,000 olive trees in Italy are due to be temporarily moved for construction. The project is described as 60% complete, and the hope is for first gas supplies to pass through it in 2020. While the size of the EIB loan means it is significant for the project, industry sources claimed that the pipeline\u2019s completion does not hinge on the finance. Critics have focused not just on the environmental impact of the pipeline, but human rights issues in Azerbaijan, which is producing the gas. \u201cGranting such loan, especially after Azerbaijan\u2019s membership in the extractive industries transparency initiative had been suspended in March over its government\u2019s continued crackdown on media and civil society, means the EIB is turning a blind eye to gross human rights violations,\u201d said Sol. One energy expert said that while the criticisms were valid, on balance the project should be supported, because it would bring more competition to Europe\u2019s gas supplies, be a significant job creator and squeeze out dirtier energy sources. \u201cThere is actually room for gas demand growth in south-east Europe, albeit to back out coal and at times fuel oil from power generation, but also in other parts of the energy economy, notably space heating, and industry,\u201d said Dr Tim Boersma, an expert on global natural gas markets at Columbia University. Boersma said the benefits did not negate human rights issues, but the shared interests that Europe and Azerbaijan would have over gas trade could help dialogue about concerns. He also pointed out that some reports have suggested Russian gas could end up being delivered through the pipeline, which would undermine the effort to diversify supply. A spokesperson for the TAP said: \u201cThere is a strong market rationale for our project. Europe needs new sources of natural gas to meet its long-term demand, fuel economic recovery and diversify energy supply. \u201cGas \u2013 as the cleanest fossil fuels \u2013 will continue to play a key, strategic role in the energy mix for decades to come. Therefore, we remain confident that TAP will secure external funding for the project.\u201d The EIB said it could not comment before its board meeting on Tuesday.",

    "webTitle": "Urgent talks over future of Four Seasons care homes in UK", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The care homes operator Four Seasons Health Care is on course for a stay of execution before a crunch debt deadline, after its major creditor offered to drop demands rejected by directors. Last-ditch talks aimed at staving off the worst care homes collapse since Southern Cross were continuing on Sunday. Four Seasons\u2019 largest creditor, US investment firm H/2 Capital Partners, is understood to have made concessions amid pressure from the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, to dispel anxiety around the firm\u2019s future. Loss-making Four Seasons, owned by multimillionaire Guy Hands\u2019 Guernsey-based private equity group Terra Firma, has said it may not be able to honour a \u00a326m debt interest payment due on Friday, raising the prospect of the company falling into administration. Terra Firma has offered to resolve the crisis by handing over the keys to Four Seasons to H/2, led by former Lehman Brothers banker Spencer Haber, which owns the majority of Four Seasons\u2019 \u00a3525m debt. H/2 has so far rejected Terra Firma\u2019s proposals and instead offered a \u201cstandstill\u201d agreement that would defer the debt deadline, but only if conditions are met that sources close to the negotiations said last week were \u201cunsignable\u201d. One of these was that any detailed discussion of Four Seasons\u2019 finances should be followed by a \u201ccleansing statement\u201d, where confidential information is released. This would prevent H/2 finding itself in possession of non-public information, a scenario that would narrow its options by legally precluding it from selling its bonds. H/2 also wanted Four Seasons\u2019 directors replaced by an entirely independent board, but is understood to be ready to withdraw or water down the demand. Efforts to find a compromise are understood to have been boosted by the intervention of the CQC, which has the power to stop care homes accepting new residents. A deal under which debt payments are deferred for up to six months could be announced as soon as Monday. However, Terra Firma has been excluded from the talks, leaving the likelihood of a three-way deal, not to mention a more permanent agreement, in some doubt. One major bone of contention is the ownership of 24 care homes that are profitable, unlike a sizeable chunk of the 343 homes that make up Four Seasons. These homes, says Terra Firma, were accidentally added to the assets over which H/2 has security due to a slip of the pen by the law firm Allen &amp; Overy. Postponing the debt deadline will allow time for the matter to be settled in court, removing one element of uncertainty from near-term talks over the company\u2019s future. An agreement would also stave off the immediate threat that Four Seasons could be placed into administration, either by its creditors or its directors. Sources familiar with the talks have suggested that H/2 would have the least to lose from an administration process. The firm owns the majority of Four Seasons\u2019 \u00a3525m high-interest bonds, which it bought at a discount for an estimated \u00a3260m and which have already yielded \u00a350m in interest. If administrators are appointed, they would be obliged to secure the best result for creditors, led by H/2. According to some estimates, H/2 could end up sitting on a profit, either on paper or in cash terms, of more than \u00a3200m. As one source familiar with the situation put it: \u201cIt\u2019s heads they win, tails they win.\u201d Some observers have warned that an administration could see loss-making homes closed, causing anxiety and disruption for residents and forcing local authorities to fund their continued care. Labour\u2019s shadow social care minister, Barbara Keeley, called on the government to explain how this would be possible in a worst-case scenario given tight budgets. She said: \u201cHow will councils be able to meet extra demand when they are already struggling under the weight of Tory funding cuts, which will have led to \u00a36.3bn being taken from social care budgets by March 2018?\u201d \u201cTory ministers need to come forward with an immediate funding solution, which was called for by the House of Commons recently, and meet the funding gap both for this year and the rest of this parliament. Administration now looks a more distant prospect but it remains unclear how Terra Firma and H/2 can agree a mutually acceptable permanent solution for the business. H/2 said it was \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to secure a deal and that Four Seasons\u2019 residents and employees were its main priority. Concern about Four Seasons could reawaken debate about the role of high finance in social care, with the wounds of the 2012 collapse of Southern Cross still fresh. Four Seasons, which is responsible for the care of 17,000 elderly and vulnerable people, has passed through the hands of a succession of owners, including the Qatar Investment Authority and RBS, all operating a heavily leveraged model. While Terra Firma cut the group\u2019s debts, the high interest rate on Four Seasons\u2019 remaining bonds \u2013 yielding as much as 12.5% \u2013 has become unsustainable. This is partly because spending on social care by austerity-hit local authorities has fallen in real terms, while costs have risen. Since the Brexit vote, 96% fewer nurses have arrived in the UK from the European Union, forcing Four Seasons to use agency workers who cost up to three times as much.",

However, Terra Firma has been excluded from the talks, leaving the likelihood of a three-way deal, not to mention a more permanent agreement, in some doubt.</p> <p>One major bone of contention is the ownership of 24 care homes that are profitable, unlike a sizeable chunk of the 343 homes that make up Four Seasons.</p> <p>These homes, says Terra Firma, were accidentally added to the assets over which H/2 has security due to a slip of the pen by the law firm Allen &amp; Overy. </p> <p>Postponing the debt deadline will allow time for the matter to be settled in court, removing one element of uncertainty from near-term talks over the company\u2019s future.</p> <p>An agreement would also stave off the immediate threat that Four Seasons could be placed into administration, either by its creditors or its directors.</p> <p>Sources familiar with the talks have suggested that H/2 would have the least to lose from an administration process. The firm owns the majority of Four Seasons\u2019 \u00a3525m high-interest bonds, which it bought at a discount for an estimated \u00a3260m and which have already yielded \u00a350m in interest.</p> <p>If administrators are appointed, they would be obliged to secure the best result for creditors, led by H/2. According to some estimates, H/2 could end up sitting on a profit, either on paper or in cash terms, of more than \u00a3200m. As one source familiar with the situation put it: \u201cIt\u2019s heads they win, tails they win.\u201d</p> <p>Some observers have warned that an administration could see loss-making homes closed, causing anxiety and disruption for residents and forcing local authorities to fund their continued care.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow social care minister, Barbara Keeley, called on the government to explain how this would be possible in a worst-case scenario given tight budgets.</p> <p>She said: \u201cHow will councils be able to meet extra demand when they are already struggling under the weight of Tory funding cuts, which will have led to \u00a36.3bn being taken from social care budgets by March 2018?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cTory ministers need to come forward with an immediate funding solution, which was called for by the House of Commons recently, and meet the funding gap both for this year and the rest of this parliament.</p> <p>Administration now looks a more distant prospect but it remains unclear how Terra Firma and H/2 can agree a mutually acceptable permanent solution for the business.</p> <p>H/2 said it was \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to secure a deal and that Four Seasons\u2019 residents and employees were its main priority.</p> <p>Concern about Four Seasons could reawaken debate about the role of high finance in social care, with the wounds of the 2012 collapse of Southern Cross still fresh.</p> <p>Four Seasons, which is responsible for the care of 17,000 elderly and vulnerable people, has passed through the hands of a succession of owners, including the Qatar Investment Authority and RBS, all operating a heavily leveraged model.</p> <p>While Terra Firma cut the group\u2019s debts, the high interest rate on Four Seasons\u2019 remaining bonds \u2013 yielding as much as 12.5% \u2013 has become unsustainable.</p> <p>This is partly because spending on social care by austerity-hit local authorities has fallen in real terms, while costs have risen.</p> <p>Since the Brexit vote, 96% fewer nurses have arrived in the UK from the European Union, forcing Four Seasons to use agency workers who cost up to three times as much.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rarely has a chancellor had to publish economic forecasts as downbeat as those in last month\u2019s budget, but so far the political fallout has been minimal. Philip Hammond has had a good couple of weeks. That is partly explained by the focus on other matters, such as the investigation into Damian Green and, of course, Brexit. An added bonus for Hammond is that the post-budget attention has not been on him but on John McDonnell, his Labour shadow. McDonnell\u2019s problems began on budget day when Andrew Neil asked him how much Britain was paying each year in debt interest. The shadow chancellor clearly did not know the answer - \u00a348bn - and tried to wing it. In a subsequent interview, he bridled when questioned about how much Labour\u2019s spending plans would add to the national debt - impossible to say - replying that was why his advisers had iPads. That was the cue for a concerted attack on McDonnell and his plan to borrow an additional \u00a3250bn over the next decade for investment in Britain\u2019s infrastructure. There was much talk about leaving future generations with an intolerable debt burden, with the political subtext being that a man who could not give a straightforward answer to simple questions could not be trusted with the nation\u2019s money. This was not the shadow chancellor\u2019s finest hour. He came across as overconfident and underprepared. It is hard to imagine Gordon Brown not knowing how much the Major government was paying in debt interest back in the mid-1990s. That said though, McDonnell was right. Extra borrowing certainly means an increase in the national debt and higher debt interest payments in the short term, but that is not the real issue. Imagine the chief executive of a FTSE 100 company going on TV to announce that the company was planning to go to the City to finance a new plant. The interview would not centre on what the investment meant for the company\u2019s debt interest payments. The chief executive would be asked about what it meant for jobs, earnings and profits. In the event that the chief executive was asked about the cost of the investment, they would give the same answer as McDonnell did, that at current rates of interest the investment would more than pay for itself, because otherwise we would not be doing it. Our debt interest payments will depend on what happens to interest rates and inflation, but our best judgment is that the investment will wash itself. Instead of obsessing about the red herring of debt interest payments, more attention should be paid to the things that do matter. Labour is planning to borrow to invest, not to cover day-to-day government spending, and that makes sense if the return on the investment is higher than the cost of financing the extra debt. Governments do not go bust, which means that they can borrow more cheaply than companies. Since the financial crisis of a decade ago, interest rates have been historically low and if he chose to do so, Hammond could borrow money at a cost of little more than 2%, below the current rate of inflation. All very well, McDonnell\u2019s critics may say, but what happens if a chancellor\u2019s public investment plans spook the markets and force up interest rates? In those circumstances, higher public investment will make private investment more expensive and so less attractive. This would certainly be a plausible argument were Britain at the height of a raging boom, but the chances of that any time soon look pretty remote. The financial markets currently think that 10-year bond yields - how much it costs the government to borrow for 10 year- will still only be just over 2% in 2027. As Michael Burke noted in Socialist Economic Bulletin, the returns on commercial investment are on average around 12%. \u201cAny government, or business, which can borrow at such low interest rates for such high investment returns would be foolish to pass up this opportunity. It is reckless and extreme that the Tories have passed up this opportunity,\u201d the Irish economist wrote. This raises a second issue, namely whether a future Labour government would get a commercial rate of return on its investment. That means choosing the right projects, which Labour says it would do after consultation with industry and expert bodies. The \u00a310bn cost of a Crossrail for the north would unlock \u00a385bn of additional economic growth, the party says, while electrification of the Great Western Railway would cost \u00a3750m but generate economic benefits two and a half times as big. Debt levels were high \u2013 albeit declining as a share of GDP \u2013 in the 1950s and 60s when governments borrowed money to build houses and the motorway network. They were right to do so. There were equally some real turkeys, most notably Concorde and nuclear power stations, and Whitehall is still a sucker for a vanity project. Witness HS2. The highest rates of return are often on unglamorous local projects, but they are available. The criticism aimed at McDonnell in the past couple of weeks is a sign that the government and its media allies are worried, as they should be because the last seven years are littered with mistakes, spurned opportunities and missed targets, all of which have resulted in austerity lasting for 15 years rather than five. It was reckless of George Osborne as chancellor to cut capital investment so deeply in 2010 in the belief that there would be a fillip to private-sector confidence from his tough approach to deficit reduction. The private sector investment boom never happened, growth slowed and the government missed all its deficit and debt targets. When the newly formed Office for Budget Responsibility made its first forecasts in the summer of 2010, it predicted that debt as a share of national income would peak in 2013-14 at just over 70% of GDP. With a bit of creative accounting, Hammond says the peak will now be in the current financial year, 2017-18, but at 86.5% of GDP. Interest payments on the debt are expected to run at just over \u00a350bn a year for the next five years. As Lord Robert Skidelsky said in a recent House of Lords debate, since 2010 the government had made \u201cliquidating the deficit and reducing the share of the national debt in GDP their top priority. No matter that they keep missing their targets, they return to them every year, but each time with a longer timeline.\u201d Skidelsky added that it was the government\u2019s obsession with deficit reduction that left them with no money to finance its new industrial strategy. \u201cWe could put it technically. What they have done is concentrated on reducing the numerator \u2013 the deficit \u2013 without considering its harmful effects on the denominator, which is the economy.\u201d McDonnell is suggesting the opposite approach.

      "bodyText": "All the talk is about back pay in the Shirebrook offices of Sports Direct at the moment. This week, the independent shareholders of the Derbyshire-based company will vote on whether to pay the older brother of founder Mike Ashley \u00a311m in back pay. The vote at the general meeting will come a few days after another group of Sports Direct workers were found to have been underpaid. The company and its employment agencies Best Connection and Transline were last week named and shamed by the government for paying warehouse workers less than the legal minimum wage, underpaying them by nearly \u00a31m in total. Sports Direct and the two agencies made up three of the top four underpayers in the latest list from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. At the other end of the pay scale, Wednesday\u2019s meeting will see whether John Ashley should get his multimillion-pound back pay after an internal report found that he had missed out owing to PR concerns over the mammoth sum. Not that Mike Ashley thinks the vote to pay him will go through. He said last month he expected shareholders to vote against it, because of the passage of time, but believes it should be paid. \u201cTechnically, the money is still owed,\u201d he said. Awkward call coming up for Dixons Carphone There are not expected to be any early Christmas presents for shareholders in Dixons Carphone this week when the retailer announces its half-year results. Analysts have been sounding the warning bells amid concerns about a tough smartphone market. Last month broker Stifel Nicolaus downgraded it from a buy to a hold. Not that this will be the first time shareholders have been made aware of the problems: last August, the company warned of a steep fall in profits as it emerged customers were holding on to their phones for longer as the weak pound pushed up the price of handsets. The company \u2013 which trades as Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse \u2013 said that smartphone prices had risen in the aftermath of the Brexit vote and that people were now holding on to them for an average of 29 months instead of 24. In addition, the scrapping of EU roaming charges also took a toll on the lifetime value of phone contracts. There was one glimpse of light for the retailer (but not necessarily the consumer): chief exec Seb James said in the summer there had been no change in how people use phones, and so worsening battery life might force them to upgrade eventually. \u2018Expected inflation\u2019 is on the rise too The economic squeeze is expected to continue for beleaguered British households. The Office for National Statistics will release figures on inflation for November on Tuesday, with economists polled by Reuters expecting that the consumer prices index rise will hold at 3% \u2013 the highest rate in the past five years. In October, inflation hit its highest level since 2012 as higher transport and food costs lifted prices. Last month, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 0.5%, in line with expectations, and cited the inflation rise as partial justification for the move. Wage growth has been lagging behind as prices increase, meaning that households are being increasingly squeezed in their monthly budgets. A Bank of England survey of public perceptions of where inflation is likely to go in future shows that people expect it to be at 2.9% in two years\u2019 time, up from a previous prediction of 2.7%. The central bank has said that it expects to raise interest rates gradually over the coming years and that the rate of inflation will fall to 2.2% by late 2019. How the public see the rate of inflation changing in future is monitored closely by policymakers.",

      "body": "<p>All the talk is about back pay in the Shirebrook offices of Sports Direct at the moment. This week, the independent shareholders of the Derbyshire-based company will vote on whether to pay the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/24/sports-direct-mike-ashley-brother-shareholder\" title=\"\">older brother of founder Mike Ashley</a> \u00a311m in back pay.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/24/sports-direct-mike-ashley-brother-shareholder\">Sports Direct criticised over plan to pay \u00a311m to Mike Ashley\u2019s brother</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The vote at the general meeting will come a few days after another group of Sports Direct workers were found to have been underpaid. The company and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/08/sports-direct-and-its-staffing-agencies-paid-workers-1m-too-little\" title=\"\">employment agencies</a> Best Connection and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/26/sports-direct-transline-shirebrook-warehouse-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">Transline</a> were last week named and shamed by the government for paying warehouse workers less than the legal minimum wage, underpaying them by nearly&#xa0;\u00a31m in total.</p> <p>Sports Direct and the two agencies made up three of the top four underpayers in the latest list from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. At the other end of the pay scale, Wednesday\u2019s meeting will see whether John Ashley should get his multimillion-pound back pay after an internal report found that he had missed out owing to PR concerns over the mammoth sum.</p> <p>Not that Mike Ashley thinks the vote to pay him will go through. He said last month he expected shareholders to vote against it, because of the passage of time, but believes it should be paid. \u201cTechnically, the money is still owed,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Awkward call coming up for Dixons Carphone</h2> <p>There are not expected to be any early Christmas presents for shareholders in Dixons Carphone this week when the retailer announces its half-year results. Analysts have been sounding the warning bells amid concerns about a tough smartphone market.</p> <p>Last month broker Stifel Nicolaus downgraded it from a buy to a hold. Not that this will be the first time shareholders have been made aware of the problems: last August, the company warned of a steep fall in profits as it emerged customers were holding on to their phones for longer as the weak pound pushed up the price of handsets.</p> <p>The company \u2013 which trades as Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse \u2013 said that smartphone prices had risen in the aftermath of the Brexit vote and that people were now holding on to them for an average of 29 months instead of 24.</p> <p>In addition, the scrapping of EU roaming charges also took a toll on the lifetime value of phone contracts. There was one glimpse of light for the retailer (but not necessarily the consumer): chief exec Seb James said in the summer there had been no change in how people use phones, and so worsening battery life might force them to upgrade eventually.</p> <h2>\u2018Expected inflation\u2019 is on the rise too</h2> <p>The economic squeeze is expected to continue for beleaguered British households. The Office for National Statistics will release figures on inflation for November on Tuesday, with economists polled by Reuters expecting that the consumer prices index rise will hold at 3% \u2013 the highest rate in the past five years.</p> <p>In October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/05/uk-consumers-face-sharpest-price-rise-services-uk-brexit\" title=\"\">inflation</a> hit its highest level since 2012 as higher transport and food costs lifted prices. Last month, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/02/bank-of-england-raises-uk-interest-rates-brexit-inflation\" title=\"\">Bank of England increased interest rates</a> to 0.5%, in line with expectations, and cited the inflation rise as partial justification for the&#xa0;move.</p> <p>Wage growth has been lagging behind as prices increase, meaning that households are being increasingly squeezed in their monthly budgets. A&#xa0;Bank of England survey of public perceptions of where inflation is likely to go in future shows that people expect it to be at 2.9% in two years\u2019 time, up from a previous prediction of&#xa0;2.7%.</p> <p>The central bank has said that it expects to raise interest rates gradually&#xa0;over the coming years and that the&#xa0;rate of inflation will fall to 2.2% by late 2019.</p> <p>How the public see the rate of inflation changing in future is monitored closely by policymakers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade secretary, Liam Fox, will be a star of this week\u2019s meeting in Buenos Aires of the World Trade Organisation. This won\u2019t be for anything he has to say so much as for being the representative of the UK as it nears the European Union\u2019s exit door. Most economists expect that a hard Brexit \u2013 which Fox prefers to a deal that keeps the UK entwined with EU institutions \u2013 would damage global trade. A soft Brexit is expected to be a modest blow. This might not matter had global trade not been going through a rough patch over the past couple of years. In 2014 and 2015 it slumped as foreign investment slowed, developed nations rowed back on outsourcing, sanctions on Russia bit and Brazil\u2019s corruption scandals hit some of the country\u2019s biggest businesses. This year is proving to be much better with the International Monetary Fund forecasting growth of 3.7% and the investment bank ING saying it will be more like 4.2%, up from its measure of below 2% last year. Next year, though, is likely to see a slowing again as China seeks to source more services internally, offsetting a return to more buoyant trade figures from Russia, Brazil and the US. Fox, though, says he is in the Argentinian capital to talk about rules governing the export of digital services and information without costly customs duties and to make domestic regulations in other countries more transparent for the UK\u2019s small and medium-sized businesses. On these points he is considered by anti-poverty campaigners and developing world nations to be just another mouthpiece for big corporations. Google, Amazon and Facebook are desperate to open the doors of nervous developing world countries and gain access to the information held on their citizens. Fox and his colleagues in the G7, believing they have lost the race for domination in the trade of goods, want to make sure the digital services revolution remains firmly in their hands. Global Justice Now, the charity previously known as the World Development Movement, says digital services are \u201cthe new oil\u201d of the global economy and that developed countries \u201cwant rules to ensure they can use and abuse this data as they wish \u2013 moving it around the world without restriction or responsibility\u201d. It adds: \u201cThis stops countries being able to adequately tax and regulate these companies so that all can benefit from new technology.\u201d The charity wanted to be in Buenos Aires to protest at moves to write into the WTO\u2019s rules the digital dominance of western businesses, but Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, banned it and 62 other activist organisations from entering the country. The Norwegian activist organisation Attac Norway has already seen its representative deported in a show of strength by Argentinian authorities. All the non-governmental organisations were accredited by the WTO before Macri stepped in to crush any potential dissent. As a way of stopping another Seattle, where anti-globalisation activists rioted for two days in 1999, the president\u2019s actions have cut off protest at the source. But as an advert for the benefits of global trade and globalisation, it reveals a nervousness that appears to make protest more than justified. The debate about e-commerce, in the view of many charities hoping to attend the event, was a distraction from discussing farm subsidies, fishing rights and the development agenda that is supposed to promote the efforts of poorer countries to grow in a more sustainable way than their rich counterparts. The US, among others, wants to limit India\u2019s protections for its farmers and consumers. Rich countries want to lay down blanket rules on subsidies for fishing that ignore local concerns. It\u2019s a focus on artisan fishing in poor countries that ignores the industrial-scale scouring of the ocean floors. Roberto Azev\u00eado, WTO director general, is concerned about tackling government support for \u201cunfair and unsustainable fishing practices\u201d. But his support for helping smaller businesses \u201cto participate more fully in international trade\u201d is seen as a distraction when most trade is conducted and controlled by the biggest companies. Bitcoin\u2019s hardly our first bubble. But where are the regulators? Fear of missing out \u2013 or Fomo, as chroniclers of investment bubbles call it \u2013 is the lust for unearned and easy money that drives even conservative types to speculate wildly, although they know the music could stop at any moment. Bitcoin is at the full-blown Fomo stage. The digital currency is the talk of offices, pubs and newspaper front pages \u2013 and that\u2019s just the UK. The mania is said to be most frenzied in Asia, especially China. Few people, one suspects, could explain how bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology works or describe what a bitcoin \u201cminer\u201d does. But everyone knows punters are sitting on stunning profits. One unit of the currency cost $750 a year ago, fetched $10,000 10 days ago and hit $16,000 at the end of last week. A 60% return in 10 days? It\u2019s a speculator\u2019s dream. Should the rest of us \u2013 those shaking our heads and muttering about how it can\u2019t last \u2013 care? Before now, no. When the bubble burst, the losers would have only had themselves to blame. Yet we\u2019ve now reached a point where regulators cannot simply sit on their hands. The theoretical value of bitcoins in circulation is \u00a3200bn and the mainstream financial world is moving in. Two Chicago exchanges want to offer trading in bitcoin futures, or derivatives of the digital currency. That changes the game, and potentially makes it seriously messy. Derivatives allow the opportunity to bet with leverage and borrowed money, and thus create the possibility of losses rebounding through the system. Should trading in bitcoin futures even be allowed? Perhaps: but regulators should insist that any firm speculating with other people\u2019s money has the approval of end investors and can show it can absorb heavy losses. Regulators should also tell us what they are doing to protect the integrity of the financial system. If bitcoin is only directly useful for fraudsters and money launderers, as bankers keep telling us, who is looking out for society\u2019s interests? We don\u2019t mind speculators getting burned \u2013 but we expect zero tolerance of tax evasion. It\u2019s time officials showed they\u2019re on the job. Their current silence is alarming. Could walkouts at Ryanair spell the end for O\u2019Leary? Could the unthinkable be happening at Ryanair? In a decade marked by grassroots uprisings against established order, from the Arab spring through to Brexit to Trump, the Irish airline\u2019s leader has, so far, blithely faced down all dissent from the ranks. Michael O\u2019Leary, who refuses to recognise trade unions, said complaints aired by pilots and crew were concocted by unnamed \u201ccompetitor\u201d airlines, and has been dismissive of any threatened staff action. However, a shortage of pilots left the chief executive unusually contrite this year over outspoken comments about his staff \u2013 and some believe this is the time for a showdown. Ryanair pilots are due to walk out in Portugal and Italy this week, and colleagues elsewhere may join, despite the risk of sanctions. Ryanair pre-emptively cancelled thousands of flights this winter because of a lack of pilots on the roster \u2013 a decision which, according to some analysts, O\u2019Leary preferred to the risk of leaving the airline stretched and exposed to industrial action. Don\u2019t expect to see the statues of O\u2019Leary toppled in Ryanair\u2019s Dublin HQ soon.",
