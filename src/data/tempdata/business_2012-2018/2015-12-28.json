Short stays in cities around the world are planned by 27% of UK adults, followed by beach holidays (13%), walking expeditions (10%) and spa/retreat holidays (8%), research from Sainsbury\u2019s Travel Insurance has found. Prospective holidaymakers expect to spend \u00a3846 per person on the cost of their holiday alone, before add-ons and extras such as spending money, according to the research. One in seven (14%) say they have saved all year to get the holiday they want, while one in 12 (8%) will pay for their holiday with a credit card to spread the cost. One in five UK holidaymakers aim to book their 2016 getaways by the end of this year, Sainsbury\u2019s found. The 8.7 million early bookers are among the 34 million-plus people in the UK planning overseas holidays in 2016, while more than 38 million are also arranging a main or separate break in the UK. The forward planners included 12% who had already booked by the end of October and a further 9% who plan to book by the end of 2015. Another 12% intend to book during January 2016. Tom Thomson, of Sainsbury\u2019s Bank Travel Insurance, said: \u201cA good proportion of holidaymakers are early bookers, who plan ahead and like to have something to look forward to.\u201d Twice as many holidaymakers are confident they will book independently, going direct to their chosen airline and accommodation providers, compared with those who say they will book through a travel agent (26% against 13%), with the remainder still unsure. The research was based on a survey of 2,003 UK adults between 27-30 October. A separate travel trends report 2016 from the Association of British Travel Agents suggests that almost a quarter (23%) of the population expect to spend more on their holidays, up slightly from 20% last year. Almost one in five people (18%) said they were prepared to be adventurous and travel to a country they have never visited before, compared with 9% who said this last year. Nearly a quarter (23%) will try a new resort or city, compared with 10% who said the same last year.",

      "bodyText": "Lidl is to sell English wine for the first time, in a major commercial boost for the burgeoning industry. As part of its latest push to attract well-heeled shoppers, the German discount supermarket will stock three Broadwood\u2019s Folly wines made by the award-winning producer Denbies, based in Surrey. The wines, which will go on sale in early March as part of Lidl\u2019s Easter offering, will retail at \u00a37.99 for the ros\u00e9 and white and \u00a314.99 for the sparkling variety. In July 2014 the supermarket unveiled a \u00a312m push into the premier wine market, dubbed the \u201cBordeaux offensive\u201d and its biggest UK product launch, in a bid to woo middle-class shoppers and pitting it against the likes of Waitrose, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Morrisons. The bargain fine wine range, which includes Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape and Ch\u00e2teau La Tour, has fuelled a 40% increase in Lidl\u2019s wine sales over the last year. The company has used its European clout to buy wine in large volumes and pass on price savings to customers, and aims to make products seen as exclusive more accessible. Denbies is the UK\u2019s largest vineyard and currently produces around 10% of the country\u2019s wine. Ben Hulme, the head of beers, wines and spirits at Lidl, said: \u201cWe are delighted to be offering a range of English wines as part of our Easter Wine Cellar range. The English wine industry is growing and is something we as a retailer are keen to support, therefore we are excited to have partnered with the Denbies Wine Estate to stock three delicious English wines; a white, ros\u00e9 and a sparkling wine.\u201d \u201cIt is a great time for English wines,\u201d said Julia Trustram Eve of the English Wine Producers trade body. \u201cWith the ever-growing consumer interest in, and demand for English wines, this is an exciting move within the multiple sector to make English wines even more accessible.\u201d The growing popularity of English wine has fuelled a rush to develop UK vineyards, with applications rising by more than 40% in the past year, new figures reveal. Miles Beale, the chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: \u201cThe production of English wine has seen record vintages in the last two years with 4.5m bottles in 2013 and 6.3m bottles in 2014. Based on the latest growth figures, this is set to double, with a staggering 12m bottles of English wine per year expected by 2020.\u201d Marks &amp; Spencer recently launched its first Welsh wine, the Tintern Parva bacchus from Parva Farm Vineyards in Monmouthshire, and for Christmas it offered its first magnum of English sparkling wine, the 2010 Ridgeview Blanc de Blancs. Waitrose, which stocks more than 100 English and Welsh wines, reported a 95% increase in sales of its range in 2014, and in October it stocked its first English dessert wine, again from Denbies. The growing popularity of English wine has been helped by a renaissance in English food. Chefs want local wine to go with their locally sourced food, and English wine is now on the menus of high-end restaurants owned by Gordon Ramsay, Heston Blumenthal and Jamie Oliver.",

      "bodyText": "It was the year Cadbury\u2019s caused outrage among chocolate lovers by changing the recipe for its beloved Creme Egg, and fizzy drinks giant Coca-Cola was tricked into tweeting out large chunks of Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. But 2015 was mainly about Greece: Greece\u2019s debt crisis, Greece\u2019s referendum, Greece\u2019s bailout, Greece\u2019s election, Greece\u2019s second election. At one point it really seemed that the battered country, which has been through so much, would finally crash out of the eurozone. Of our 10 most popular stories during the year, seven were about Greece. Our coverage was dominated by our live business blog, in which Graeme Wearden tirelessly documented the extraordinary events as they happened. Five of the blogs had more than 1m page views; two had more than 2m. Based on the number of page views, here\u2019s the full list of the 10 most popular stories from Guardian business in 2015. 1. Greece bailout deal agreed In a marathon Brussels summit lasting more than 16 hours - the longest in EU history - an agreement was finally reached that would lead to a third bailout for Greece and keep the country in the eurozone. It was also a marathon Guardian live blog, running for more than 26 hours, as we detailed the nail biting progress of the talks and prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s eventual agreement to a further swathe of austerity measures and economic reforms. (12-13 July) 2. Greece rejects troika proposals In a move that stunned the eurozone, Greek voters delivered a resounding No to the nation\u2019s creditors, overwhelmingly rejecting the troika\u2019s proposals in an historic referendum. It was a sensational result, with the No campaign securing 61.31% of the vote. In a television address, Tsipras said the outcome showed that democracy could not be blackmailed. Just a week later, however, he would be forced to accept bailout terms even more onerous that those the nation had so dramatically rejected. (6 July) 3. Coca-Cola tweets Mein Kampf Coca-Cola was forced to withdraw a Twitter advertising campaign after a counter-campaign by Gawker tricked it into tweeting large chunks of the introduction to Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. Coke tweeted the words \u201cMy father was a civil servant who fulfilled his duty very conscientiously\u201d in the shape of a pirate ship with a face on its sails \u2013 wearing an eyepatch \u2013 before the account was suspended. (5 February) 4. China\u2019s Black Monday So much for the August lull. Growing fears over the Chinese economy culminated in a dire day for global markets on 29 August, dubbed \u201cChina\u2019s Black Monday\u201d. Hundreds of billions were wiped off markets around the world as shares plunged in one of the worst day\u2019s trading in many years. 5. Greece misses IMF payment Greece failed to make a \u20ac1.5bn payment to the International Monetary Fund, leaving it alone, insolvent and almost bankrupt after five years of \u20ac240bn (\u00a3170bn) in European bailouts dried up. It was the first advanced economy ever to fall in arrears to the IMF. The long-running debt debacle left Greece without a financial lifeline after years of wrenching austerity, and represented a historic blow to a Europe committed to the irreversibility of its 16-year-old single currency. (1 July) 6. End of an era for Cadbury Creme Eggs Monday 12 January was a bad day for chocolate lovers, as it was revealed that the shell of Cadbury Creme Eggs would no longer be made from Cadbury\u2019s Dairy Milk chocolate but from \u201cstandard cocoa mix chocolate\u201d. Defending the move, a spokesman said: \u201cThe Creme Egg had never been called Cadbury\u2019s Dairy Milk Creme Egg. We have never played on the fact that Dairy Milk was used.\u201d (12 January) 7. Stock markets slide as Greek banks close Amid shockwaves from the closure of Greek banks and the imposition of capital controls, stock markets tumbled around the world. On the eve of the expiry of Greece\u2019s second bailout, Tsipras used a TV address to ask the shell-shocked Greek public to back his resistance to a new round of tough tax increases and spending cuts demanded by the troika. Europe\u2019s big guns lined up one after another to tell the Greeks unequivocally that voting No in Sunday\u2019s referendum would mean saying goodbye to the euro. (30 June) 8. Greek cash withdrawals restricted Another dramatic Sunday, in which Tsipras announced the imposition of capital controls, meaning banks would not reopen after the weekend. Greeks were limited to taking out just \u20ac60 a day at cash machines. The move came after the European central bank froze the emergency support offered to the Greek banking sector - two days after the Greek prime minister shocked Europe by calling a referendum. (29 June) 9. Joseph Stiglitz votes Oxi Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz captured the imagination with his column on how he would vote in the Greek referendum. Neither alternative \u2013 approval or rejection of the troika\u2019s terms \u2013 would be easy, he said, and both carried huge risks. \u201cBut a yes vote would mean depression almost without end ... By contrast, a no vote would at least open the possibility that Greece, with its strong democratic tradition, might grasp its destiny in its own hands.\u201d (29 June) 10. Greece\u2019s third bailout agreed The Greek parliament took a crucial step towards a third bailout by approving the economic measures required by its lenders, even though the prime minister himself admitted many of the \u201charsh\u201d measures would hurt the Greek economy.
