      "bodyText": "London\u2019s luxury home market has collapsed over the past six months as tax changes and uncertainty around Brexit have deterred buyers from both the UK and overseas, a property investment firm has claimed. The number of new-build properties sold for more than \u00a35m in the six months to the end of October was down 83% on the same period of 2015, according to LCP. The number of transactions fell from 52 to just nine. Large falls were also recorded across England and Wales on other high-end properties, with sales of homes costing more than \u00a310m down by 75%, from 61 to 15. Transactions for all UK properties costing between \u00a35m and \u00a310m were down by 51%, from 201 to just 99. LCP said the figures, which are taken from Land Registry data, showed that the market had been hit hard by a new higher rate of stamp duty on second homes which came into effect at the start of April. The higher rate, which is three percentage points above the normal cost, added \u00a3150,000 to the upfront cost of buying a \u00a35m property. Naomi Heaton, LCP\u2019s chief executive, said that the introduction of a higher tax on second homes \u201cagainst a backdrop of uncertainty around Brexit and the direction of travel of the UK\u2019s economy \u2026 has been one step too far for both domestic and international buyers\u201d. Developers have reported a slowdown in sales at the top end of the market, with Berkeley Homes recently reporting a 20% fall in demand as a result of the new stamp duty rate and concerns over the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Heaton said that the slump in demand for luxury new-builds was likely to have an impact further down the market. \u201cWith these top-end sales typically offsetting the cost of providing more modest housing and essential cashflow to reinvest into new development, the chancellor may well struggle to deliver upon his new affordable housing targets as developers begin to face losses,\u201d she said. LCP\u2019s analysis, which will not include all sales completed over the summer because some buyers do not register their deals immediately, found a downturn in all \u00a31m-plus price bands. Between \u00a31m and \u00a32m sales were down by a third year on year, while between \u00a32m and \u00a35m they fell by 36%. The firm said the reduction in sales would have a significant impact on the government\u2019s stamp duty tax take, and estimated that receipts would be down by \u00a3500m over the last six months. It said changes that bring properties owned by non-doms into inheritance tax could take that figure to \u00a31bn by the end of the tax year. Figures for the 2015/16 tax year showed stamp duty receipts for properties costing between \u00a31.5m and \u00a32m were up by 26% on the previous year\u2019s figure. Heaton said: \u201cPolitical posturing that has made foreign investment the scapegoat for our UK housing crisis is having an entirely negative impact. A contraction of the luxury market will not miraculously provide new homes for the domestic market. It will simply reduce tax take and damage the wider economy as affluent investors spend their money elsewhere.\u201d On Monday, property firm Knight Frank said prices in prime London postcodes had fallen by 4.8% in the year to November, and were set to end the year 6% down. In Chelsea, prices have dropped by 12.6% over the past year, it said, while around Hyde Park values are down by 11.2%. It forecast that across the market prices will remain flat in 2017.",

    "webTitle": "The day the Australian economy ran out of luck (if only temporarily) | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The September GDP figures released yesterday marked the point that the Australian economy ran out of luck, and while that misfortune might only be temporary, it highlights how fragile the economy has been for some time, even as it outgrew most of the developed world. While there was a general consensus among economists that the Australian economy went backwards in the September quarter, it was still a shock when the ABS announced that in seasonally adjusted terms it shrunk 0.5% \u2013 the second biggest drop in a quarter of a century: The annual growth picture is not much better \u2013 a drop in seasonally adjusted terms from 3.1% to 1.8%. It\u2019s the biggest drop in over 15 years, and gives us the worst annual growth this century outside the GFC period. Even the trend figures offer little solace. The quarterly trend growth of 0.2% is as bad as the worst experienced during the GFC, and the annual growth of 2.2% is a full percentage point below the 20 year average of 3.2%: It therefore wasn\u2019t surprising that the treasurer Scott Morrison chose to focus on comparison with overseas than with the past. In his press conference he suggested that Australia\u2019s \u201cannual real growth is still higher than six out of the world\u2019s G7 economies\u201d, was \u201csecond only to the United Kingdom\u201d, and was higher than \u201cthe US, Canada, Japan, Germany, and higher than the OECD average.\u201d That is all true, although when comparing us to the whole of the OECD rather than just the G7 we are rather more middle of the pack, and when you look at this latest quarter, we are now second last: So what happened? Well it is more the case of what did not happen. In much of the past year, our economy has been teetering on the edge of going backwards, but there has always been one thing to keep us in positive territory. Last quarter it was an abnormal and mostly coincidental surge of public investment in a couple states, in the March quarter it was a surge in net exports, as it was this time last year. The problem with being reliant upon exports and public investment is that those two measures are notoriously erratic. In the September quarter, because imports grew by more than our exports, net exports (exports minus imports) detracted 0.2% from GDP growth. But just two quarters ago net exports added 1% to growth, three quarter ago they added nothing, and this time last year, they contributed 1.2%. In short, not the type of thing you want to rely on for steady growth: Public investment is much the same. In the June quarter, public investment contributed 0.7% towards GDP \u2013 that is more than the actual 0.6% GDP growth of that quarter. Take that away, and our economy would have shrunk. This quarter it was taken away \u2013 rather than adding to GDP growth, this quarter public investment detracted 0.5% pts: But while it would be easy to say it was just a confluence of bad timing that led to our economy shrinking, the reality is given the fragility of the economy it is more a confluence of good timing that has kept us going, and this quarter without such luck, it all went bad. GDP growth is essentially a combination of five things \u2013 government and household consumption, private and public investment (which make up \u201cfinal demand\u201d), and net exports. For the first time this century, four of those five aspects detracted from GDP growth. Only household consumption added to growth: The drop in public investment was across the nation \u2013 only Northern Territory had an increase in the September quarter: And while it is no surprise that private investment continues to fall, the bad news for the government in this quarter was that private dwelling construction also fell. There are certainly signs that the housing construction boom is coming slightly off the boil. The annual growth of the construction of dwelling is the lowest is has been for two year in trend terms \u2013 something that would have many wishing the Reserve Bank board met today rather than on Tuesday before these figures were released: The only segment of the economy this quarter that was really driving growth rather than holding it back was household consumption. But even here things are not all that rosy. In the past 12 months households increased their consumption by 2.6% \u2013 down from 2.9% in the June quarter. And the level of household consumption is among the most marked change in the economy since the GFC. Australia has always relied upon household consumption to drive growth. In the eight years prior to the GFC consumption grew on average by 3.95%; since then it has been just 2.5%: And this weakness of consumption and investment means a weakness in what has traditionally been Australia\u2019s driver of GDP growth \u2013 demand. Despite our position as a mining nation, net exports have not traditionally been a bigger driver of growth than demand. Demand is much more stable \u2013 household consumption and private investment are less subject to spot prices and one-off occurrences \u2013 such as a large purchase of mining equipment that causes a bounce in imports. But now net exports contribute as much as do consumption and investment combined: That makes for a generally lower and also more unstable type of growth. In the 30 years prior to the GFC, demand contributed on average 3.6% to annual GDP growth \u2013 a level net exports has never reached. The reliance upon a number of small aspects means it doesn\u2019t need too many things to have a bad quarter, for the entire economy to take a hit. That hit occurred in the September quarter, and the only shock really is that it hadn\u2019t happened before.",

But just two quarters ago net exports added 1% to growth, three quarter ago they added nothing, and this time last year, they contributed 1.2%.</p> <p>In short, not the type of thing you want to rely on for steady growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of net exports to quarterly GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mEbND/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Public investment is much the same. </p> <p>In the June quarter, public investment contributed 0.7% towards GDP \u2013 that is more than the actual 0.6% GDP growth of that quarter.

Only household consumption added to growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contributions to GDP growth - seasonally adjusted\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JGxZq/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The drop in public investment was across the nation \u2013 only Northern Territory had an increase in the September quarter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Public investment growth (seasonally adjusted)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eyIRw/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And while it is no surprise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/dec/06/are-workers-right-to-be-sceptical-about-productivity-improvements\">private investment continues</a> to fall, the bad news for the government in this quarter was that private dwelling construction also fell. There are certainly signs that the housing construction boom is coming slightly off the boil. </p> <p>The annual growth of the construction of dwelling is the lowest is has been for two year in trend terms \u2013 something that would have many wishing the Reserve Bank board met today rather than on Tuesday before these figures were released:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of dwelling construction (new and used)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BENYy/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption>Annual growth of dwelling construction (new and used)</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only segment of the economy this quarter that was really driving growth rather than holding it back was household consumption. But even here things are not all that rosy.</p> <p>In the past 12 months households increased their consumption by 2.6% \u2013 down from 2.9% in the June quarter. </p> <p>And the level of household consumption is among the most marked change in the economy since the GFC. </p> <p>Australia has always relied upon household consumption to drive growth. In the eight years prior to the GFC consumption grew on average by 3.95%; since then it has been just 2.5%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Households consumption - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ypiV3/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And this weakness of consumption and investment means a weakness in what has traditionally been Australia\u2019s driver of GDP growth \u2013 demand.</p> <p>Despite our position as a mining nation, net exports have not traditionally been a bigger driver of growth than demand. Demand is much more stable \u2013 household consumption and private investment are less subject to spot prices and one-off occurrences \u2013 such as a large purchase of mining equipment that causes a bounce in imports.</p> <p>But now net exports contribute as much as do consumption and investment combined: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contributions of demand and net exports to annual GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XLpO8/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That makes for a generally lower and also more unstable type of growth. </p> <p>In the 30 years prior to the GFC, demand contributed on average 3.6% to annual GDP growth \u2013 a level net exports has never reached. </p> <p>The reliance upon a number of small aspects means it doesn\u2019t need too many things to have a bad quarter, for the entire economy to take a hit. That hit occurred in the September quarter, and the only shock really is that it hadn\u2019t happened before.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe are part of the NHS team,\u201d boasts Pfizer in a fuzzy claim on its UK website. But it\u2019s not. On the evidence presented by the Competition and Markets Authority, which whacked the US company with a record \u00a384m fine for breaking competition law, Pfizer is a company that thinks it OK to raise the price of an ancient drug by 2,600% by exploiting a loophole. The annual bill for the NHS jumped from \u00a32m to \u00a350m. The price-hiking wheeze was artful. Pfizer sold the distribution rights to an anti-epilespsy drug called Epanutin to Hertfordshire-based Flynn Phama in September 2012. As a branded medicine, Epanutin was covered by price regulation. But Flynn immediately de-branded, or genericised, the medicine. Pfizer continued to manufacture and supply the drug but, critically, in generic form both parties could charge what they wished. The result was a jump in the price of a 100mg pack from \u00a32.83 to \u00a367.50, later reduced to \u00a354. In a normal market, other generic manufacturers would rush to produce their own copycat versions and competition would erode prices the CMA called \u201cexcessive and unfair\u201d. But, as the regulator explains, this market was different. Medical advice says epilepsy patients already taking the medicine \u2013 phenytoin sodium \u2013 can\u2019t be switched to another manufacturer\u2019s generic version. \u201cAs a result, the NHS had no alternative to paying the increased prices for the drug,\u201d says the CMA. Pfizer\u2019s attempts to justify its action are horribly weak. First, it says Epanutin was loss-making at the old price. But the solution was surely to approach the NHS for a fairer price; nobody expects pharmaceutical companies to supply at a loss. According to the CMA, Pfizer recouped all its losses within two months of the hike. The company\u2019s second argument is that, even at the higher price, the capsules were still cheaper than an unspecified \u201cequivalent medicine\u201d supplied to the NHS by another company under the regulated regime. But that argument ignores the CMA\u2019s point that there wasn\u2019t an equivalent medicine for the 48,000 patients taking Pfizer\u2019s drug. The company intends to appeal against the CMA\u2019s findings, describing them as \u201cwrong in fact and law\u201d. We\u2019ll see where that leads, but Pfizer\u2019s legalistic tone is ugly and will infuriate patients, NHS managers and government. There is an unspoken bargain between wealthy countries and pharma companies: we are happy to pay good money for genuinely novel and innovative medicines, but we don\u2019t expect to be ripped off on drugs that have been around for decades. In this case, phenytoin sodium dates to 1908. The US has seen several high-profile attempts at price-gouging on obscure old medicines. Perpetrators like Martin Shkreli of Turing Pharmaceuticals have been denounced as cynical greed merchants by politicians on all sides. There are differences in the UK saga addressed by the CMA \u2013 but as many similarities. Pfizer is keeping unpleasant company and cannot be surprised if there is a backlash. It\u2019s simple: you cannot describe yourself as a \u201cpartner\u201d of the NHS and then behave this way. Port Talbot\u2019s steely resolve It was as long ago as March that Sajid Javi, then business secretary, had to rush back from a trip to Australia to mutter ineffectually about doing whatever he could to save the Port Talbot steelworks. The months have rolled by and now a likely solution has emerged \u2013 but no thanks to the government. Instead, the forces behind an agreement that would see owner Tata Steel keep the twin blast furnaces running for at least five years are these: the improvement in global steel prices; the fall in sterling that has made the south Wales plant more competitive; dogged pressure from the trade unions; and Tata patriarch Ratan Tata\u2019s wish for his company to be seen as a genuinely long-term investor and employer. Wednesday\u2019s agreement hinges on a proposal to close the \u00a315bn pension scheme to future accruals and offer workers a \u201ccompetitive\u201d defined contribution scheme instead. It is impossible to judge the details until they emerge and, note, Tata said it iwas still working on \u201ca necessary structural solution\u201d to the \u00a315bn scheme. There is potential for eleventh-hour slip-ups. But, if the agreement succeeds, Tata should be applauded for its willingness to rethink and negotiate on Port Talbot. It is also fair for Tata to appeal \u201cto other stakeholders such as the UK government\u201d to lend a hand on energy costs for heavy users like the steel industry. A business select committee report last year concluded the government could have done more, and earlier, to support UK steel. Greg Clark, new business secretary in a new government that says it believes in having an industrial strategy, should make himself useful.",

The London-listed commodities trader will invest alongside Qatar as part of a Kremlin strategy of selling assets to raise funds needed to fill a hole in its budget left by low oil prices. A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, described the deal as the largest in the global energy industry this year. He added that Vladimir Putin had congratulated Igor Sechin, Rosneft\u2019s chief executive, but also told the close ally to work with the ministry of finance and central bank to prevent the deal disrupting Russian currency markets. Glencore and Qatar\u2019s investment means they join BP on the Rosneft share register. The British oil company was handed an 18.5% stake in landmark tie-up in 2011. It is unclear how much of the latest deal will be funded by Glencore, which has wrestled with a burdensome debt pile that reached $30bn (\u00a323.7bn) at one stage, amid stubbornly low commodity prices. But the Switzerland-based company indicated this month that it had dealt with the debt problem, as it announced plans to resume dividend payments next year aftersuspending them in September 2015 to conserve cash. The dividend freeze was part of a $10bn debt reduction plan that also included asset sales. Glencore\u2019s investment in Rosneft came as a surprise to markets, despite its chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, saying earlier this month that the cost-cutting drive was complete. The deal was yet to be officially announced by the time stock markets closed on Wednesday, but industry sources indicated it was on the verge of being announced.",

      "bodyText": "Hopes that Italy\u2019s banks can be bailed out one way or another - private investors, state aid or the European bailout fund - continue to support stock markets. And the expectation that the European Central Bank may extend its bond buying programme for a few more months is also providing some support. On Wall Street the global surge in banking stocks helped push both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 to new intra-day peaks, although pharmaceutical shares were under pressure after president-elect Donald Trump said he would look at cutting drug prices. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 1.81% or 122.39 points at 6902.23 Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 1.96% to 10,986.69 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.36% at 4694.72 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.1% to 18,130.66 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.75% at 8960.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.82% to 640.07 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 92 points or 0.48% at 19344, close to the day\u2019s highs. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In Greece tensions over reforms are once again mounting with creditors \u2013 this time over an IMF demand that shops remain open for business on Sundays. Helena Smith reports: Most EU member states would relish overhauling a relic of old times like the ban on Sunday shopping. In Greece, though, it is the sort of measure that makes for front-page splashes, conspiracy theory and cries of protest. But the International Monetary Fund, in the spirit of further opening up one of the continent\u2019s most sclerotic economies, is not letting go. Instead the Washington-based body, which is still negotiating its participation in Greece\u2019s latest bailout, has stepped up demands for trade to be liberalised saying shops should remain open on Sundays. Moreover, it argues, the reform will give people work in a nation hobbled by record levels of unemployment. In its splash today, the daily Ethnos newspaper, citing a leaked email from the IMF, reports that closure of an ongoing review of the economy by creditors \u2013 the second since Athens received its third bailout last summer \u2013 is now contingent on shops opening up for commerce on Sundays. The organisation wants the measure to be signed and sealed this month. So far the response has been negative. Ministry of finance officials told the paper that, instead, they will push through an amendment that will allow shops in specially defined tourist areas to stay open. That\u2019s unlikely to pass muster with lenders who have signalled they are going to rachet up the pressure on Greece to enforce the sort of reforms that will make it more competitive. Ideologically, the governing leftwing Syriza party is said to be against the move on the grounds that it will not only benefit bigger stores but is an infringement of basic workers\u2019 rights. The Greek Orthodox Church has already likened the step to a sin and shop employees, who have already taken to the streets, are girding for further battle. And here\u2019s our full story on Matteo Renzi planning to resign later as Italian prime minister: One of the factors supporting the market rally is the expectation that the European Central Bank could announce an extension of its bond buying programme following its latest meeting on Thursday: [APP is the asset purchase programme] That hope, and optimism that Italy\u2019s struggling banks can somehow be recapitalised, have combined to send European markets higher, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.8%, France\u2019s Cac 1.1%, the FTSE 100 1.6% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB 1.5%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intra-day record of 19,276, despite concerns about healthcare companies after Donald Trump said he would look at drug pricing. Back in the UK and some good news for steel workers at Port Talbot: Markets continue to be buoyed by hopes of a resolution to Italy\u2019s banking problems. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the Italian government passing its 2017 budget, and Mario Renzi confirming he will resign this evening, the European markets maintained their banking-boosted growth this Wednesday. The continued lack of fuss following the Italian referendum result, combined with the prospect of a Monte dei Paschi bailout (potentially as soon as this week), has led the European indices to a bevy of highs this afternoon. The CAC is still at an 11 month peak, while the DAX, following a near 200 point rise, is at its best price in exactly a year. The highs hit by the FTSE were a bit less impressive, though its 110 point increase does leave the UK index just 10 points away from 6900, a level it hasn\u2019t seen since November 10th. While most of the pan-European growth has been inspired by the rallying banking sector, the FTSE has also benefited from a commodity stock rebound and the latest pound-plunge, with sterling shedding 0.8% against the dollar and 1.1% against the euro. But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, warned markets could be getting ahead of themselves: Talk that the Italian banking system could be on the verge of a \u20ac15bn bailout from the European Stability Mechanism has pushed equity markets in Europe to their highest levels in several months... While the reports of a bailout request have been denied the usual rule of thumb when these sorts of reports do the rounds is that there is usually an element of truth to them, even if we don\u2019t know the exact mechanics, and markets are responding to that. As with most things the devil is likely to be in the detail, and the likely strings that are likely to be attached to any aid request, if and when it comes. It is here that markets could be getting ahead of themselves. Well it seems Matteo Renzi will not be staying on as Italian prime minister after all and plans to resign this evening now the budget has been passed. He tweeted: AP reports: Italian Premier Matteo Renzi says he\u2019ll resign now that Parliament has completed approval of the 2017 national budget. Renzi had offered his resignation two days earlier to President Sergio Mattarella following his humiliating defeat in a government-backed voter referendum on reforms. But Mattarella told him to stay in office until passage of the budget law, which was done Wednesday afternoon. Renzi tweeted that he plans to go to the president to resign at 7 p.m. (1800 GMT). Following the poor UK manufacturing figures earlier, comes news that the economy\u2019s growth has flattened in the last few weeks, according to a leading think tank. The National Institute of Economic and Social Reseach has estimated that UK output grew by 0.4% in the three months to the end of November, the same as in the three months to October. But it warned a slowdown was ahead. The think tank said the economy was being supported by the service sector, which was borne out by the earlier weak manufacturing figures. Rebecca Piggott, research fellow at NIESR, said: Recent economic growth has been driven almost entirely by the UK\u2019s broad service sector, supported by robust consumer spending. In stark contrast, the official figures suggest that the production and construction sectors of the economy have declined over recent months. Looking ahead, we do not expect such buoyant consumer spending growth to persist. Sterling\u2019s pronounced depreciation this year is expected to pass through to the consumer prices throughout the course of 2017 and 2018, eroding the purchasing power of households substantially. NIESR\u2019s latest quarterly forecast published just over a month ago forecast GDP growth of 2% per annum in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017. CPI inflation was expected to reach 3.8% at the end of 2017. Another area likely to be hit by the uncertainty of the UK leaving the EU is the Irish banking sector, according to ratings agency Fitch. It said: Fitch Ratings has revised the 2017 sector outlook for Irish banks to stable from positive, as the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU increases uncertainty for the operating environment. Ireland\u2019s economic recovery should remain strong in the short term, underpinning the stable sector outlook. The rating outlook on Irish banks is positive, reflecting our expectation that improving bank credit fundamentals should outweigh these challenges. Brexit is negative for Ireland\u2019s long-term economic and political prospects, putting pressure on GDP growth and creating uncertainty around relations with Northern Ireland. The extent of any weakening of the bank operating environment, triggered by a slowdown of GDP growth in the UK, sterling depreciation, or potential trade barriers, will become clear only as EU-UK negotiations develop. A deterioration in the operating environment could slow any improvements in the asset quality and capitalisation of Irish banks... Capitalisation, although improving, remains vulnerable. We expect capital ratios to strengthen in 2017, despite pressure from volatility in pension fund deficits and foreign-exchange markets. Fully-loaded regulatory capital ratios remain weaker than international peers, primarily due to large amounts of deferred tax assets; these assets are reducing slowly because of Ireland\u2019s low corporate tax rate and relatively low levels of profitability compared to the size of the balance sheet. Large, albeit reducing, stocks of unreserved problem assets also leave Irish banks\u2019 capitalisation more exposed if the operating environment deteriorates. Further improvements in asset quality and capitalisation would improve the banks\u2019 risk profiles and may result in ratings upgrades; this is why the ratings outlook for Irish banks is positive. Although uncertainty as regards the operating environment has increased, we believe credit fundamentals will improve in 2017, as the sector continues to work through its backlog of impaired loans. But... Bloomberg is reporting that Renzi might be having second thoughts about stepping down. They say: Matteo Renzi is wavering on whether to stay on as Italian prime minister despite his resignation offer after Sunday\u2019s referendum defeat, according to a senior state official. President Sergio Mattarella wants Renzi to reconsider his decision in order to provide political and economic stability, said the official, who asked not to be named because the issue is confidential. Here\u2019s the full story. Newsflash! After a debate today. the Italian Senate just approved the country\u2019s 2017 budget. That\u2019s the last order of business before Matteo Renzi can formally step down as prime minister. Renzi now also expected to meet with senior members of his Democratic Party this afternoon, to discuss the next steps - including whether he remains as party leader. Back in the markets, European stocks are hitting multi-month highs on continued optimism that Italy\u2019s banking sector will receive much-needed fresh capital soon. Every index is sharply higher today, with some traders speculating that the fabled \u201cSanta Rally\u201d might be kicking off (stock markets often rally in the run-up to Christmas). Over in Milan, Monte dei Paschi is still having a good day, up 8%, following the reports that the Italian government could take a \u20ac2bn stake in the bank. And the suggestions that Rome could turn to the ESM for a \u20ac15bn bank bailout continues to calm fears of an imminent financial crisis. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: Even the prospect of a nationalisation [of Monte dei Paschi], potentially as early as this weekend, isn\u2019t spooking the markets as it may avoid retail bondholders having to take any losses. The FTSE 100 index is now up by 100 points, or 1.5% at 6880 -- a chunky rise. However, that\u2019s partly because the pound fell at 9.30am when October\u2019s weak UK manufacturing data were released. The German Dax is still at a one-year high, the French CAC is at its highest level since January, and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB it at its highest level since June. EC antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager declined to comment directly on the Monte dei Paschi rescue talks. But she did point out that the commission is keen to support citizens who have been missold financial products. That could be significant, as the small retail investors who own Italian bank bonds may argue that they were deceived about the risk of being possibly \u2018bailed into\u2019 a rescue. And some analysts reckon the Italian government could circumvent those new bail-in rules by compensating these small investors. Vestager told reporters in Brussels that: \u201cOne of the things that we are working with is tools to enable governments to compensate for mis-selling of different kinds. \u201cIt is something we have set up before. We will work with governments again if they want to set up schemes that can allow citizens to be compensated if mis-selling has been taking place.\u201d The European Commission have got a fight on their hands over today\u2019s Euribor fines. JP Morgan and HSBC have both announced that reject the EC\u2019s conclusions that they breached antitrust laws, and will fight on to try to prove it. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan (fined \u20ac337m today) says the bank could launch an appeal: \u201cWe have cooperated fully with the European Commission throughout its five year investigation. We did not engage in any wrongdoing with respect to the EURIBOR benchmark. We will continue to vigorously defend our position against these allegations, including through possible appeals to the European courts.\u201d HSBC (fined \u20ac33m) is also adamant that it didn\u2019t take part in a cartel: The European Commission\u2019s decision relates to allegations of Euribor manipulation and related purported conduct during the course of one month in early 2007. We believe we did not participate in an anti-competitive cartel. We are reviewing the European Commission\u2019s decision and considering our legal options. French bank Credit Agricole is refusing to accept that it breached antitrust rules! In a short, sharp statement, it says: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole takes note of today\u2019s decision of the European Commission in the Euribor case. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole firmly believes that it did not infringe competition law. Accordingly, it will appeal the Commission\u2019s decision before the European courts. Payment of the fine will not affect the 2016 financial statements given the provisions set aside previously. Today\u2019s fines mark the end of the euribor scandal, hopefully, Vestager continues. But.... The Commission will not hesitate to investigate and sanction any other cartel it may uncover in the future in the financial industry. Commissioner Vestager is outlining the euribor ruling now. You can watch it live here. She says JP Morgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole all breached antitrust rules by conspiring to rig the euribor rate. The euribor market is means to provide protection from market volatility in euro-denominated securities, Vestager says. If this market is rigged, it will benefit only a few. Traders used IM services and corporate chatrooms to exchange confidential information to distort the euribor rate to serve their own interests, she adds. Euribor was calculated from submissions from individual banks, which created the ability to rig it. Vestager cites one example, from 19th March 2007, in which the cartel members decided they would benefit from a lower euribor rate. So, weeks earlier, they conspired to submit low numbers to the committee which calculated the daily figure. (this will sound depressingly familiar to anyone who\u2019s read about the Libor scandal). Here\u2019s the details of the euribor-rigging fines just announced by the EC. JPMorgan: \u20ac337.2m HSBC: \u20ac33.6m Credit Agricole: \u20ac114.7m Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s antitrust commissioner, says: \u201cBanks have to respect EU competition rules just like any other company operating in the single market.\u201d These fines come three years after four other banks were fined over Euribor rigging, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Societe Generale. Newsflash! The European commission has fined Cr\u00b4dit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan a combined total of \u20ac485m for their role in the Euribor fixing scandal. This is the case in which traders were accused of conspiring to rig the official rates at which banks would lend to each other in various currencies (euros, in this case) More to follow.... City experts are pretty unimpressed by the slide in UK manufacturing in October: That disappointing UK manufacturing report has hit the pound, sending it down 0.5% against the US dollar: The Office for National Statistics reports that most areas of manufacturing struggled in October, led by pharmaceuticals, where output shrank by 3.6%. This chart shows how Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector weakened in October, after two months of gains: Breaking: Britain\u2019s industrial sector has suffered its biggest fall in output sine 2012. UK industrial production shrank by 1.3% in October, dashing hopes of a 0.2% rise. It\u2019s partly due to the temporary shutdown of the Buzzard oil field in the North Sea. But... manufacturing certainly had a poor month too. Output across manufacturing firms fell by 0.9% in October. That\u2019s the weakest performance since February, and will raise fears that the economy is weakening. Economist Mark Astley says the figures are much weaker than expected. Investec\u2019s Philip Shaw hopes that the underlying picture is better. Every single Italian bank share has risen this morning, led by Monte dei Paschi which is currently 7.7% higher. Europe\u2019s bailout fund has just said that it hasn\u2019t received a request for help from Italy, and hasn\u2019t had any discussions about a possible programme. Asked about reports that Rome is planning a \u20ac15bn bailout request for its banks, a spokesman for the European Stability Mechanism says: \u201cThere is no request and there are no discussions with theItalian authorities on an ESM loan.\u201d However...this denial doesn\u2019t mean that Italy isn\u2019t preparing a request for help from the ESM, of course.... Looking away from Italy, the big news this morning is that drugs giant Pfizer has been hit with a record fine after the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug was hiked by up to 2,600%. Boom! Germany\u2019s DAX stock market has hit its highest level in a year, while France\u2019s CAC is at an 11-month high. Optimism is rife in the City that a recapitalisation solution for troubled Italian bank Monte dei Paschi is in the pipeline, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets However, this could be via Italy applying for a \u20ac15bn loan from Europe\u2019s ESM to help recapitalise several troubled banks and not just MPS which would avoid the issue of illegal state aid/bailout. Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet says investors are hopeful that Rome will get a grip on the crisis: \u201cDespite the fact that the probability of early elections has risen, the market is focusing on the banking sector and the fact the government seems to be showing more urgency in dealing with that problem.\u201d However.... financial analyst Dan Davies (who actually owns some MPS shares, bold lad) isn\u2019t convinced that a bailout will benefit shareholders. European stock markets are all rallying this morning, with banking stocks boosted by Italian bailout hopes. The main indices are up around 1%, pushing the FTSE 100 up by almost 60 points to 6837. La Stampa\u2019s report that Italy may seek European help for its banks is cheering the City: In London, mining stocks are also gaining ground, with Rio Tinto and Antofagasta both up 4%. Shares in Monte Dei Paschi have jumped by 9% at the start of trading in Milan, on hopes that Italy can pull off a rescue package. Other Italian banks are rallying too, driving the whole sector up 3%. Traders are reacting to La Stampa\u2019s claim that Italy could seek a \u20ac15bn bailout (even though it\u2019s just been denied) They\u2019re also comforted by Reuters\u2019 overnight report that Italy could take a \u20ac2bn stake in Monte dei Paschi, in a bid to: a) encourage private investors to back the \u20ac5bn cash call b) avoid inflicting losses on small retail investors who hold MPS bonds. One source told Reuters that: \u201cIt\u2019s a de-facto nationalisation with a strong presence by the state that can attract other investors and allow the transaction to be completed. Italian government debt is rallying this morning, pushing the yield (interest rate) on its 10-year debt down to 1.91%, from 1.97%. That has narrowed the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs - a key measure of stress in the eurozone. Italy\u2019s La Stampa newspaper is reporting that Rome is considering seeking a \u20ac15bn loan from European authorities, to recapitalise its banking sector. According to the report, Italy would use the funds to shore up several banks, not just Monte dei Paschi. In return, Rome would have to commit to tightening its 2017 budget (which might be tricky, given the political void at present). It\u2019s an intriguing idea, with one problem....it\u2019s just been denied by Italy\u2019s Treasury department. But how could it happen? These funds would come from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which is Europe\u2019s bailout fund. Spain took a similar loan a few years ago, which helped it avoid falling into a financial crisis. The attraction for Italy would that such a loan would come with fewer strings attached than a full-scale bailout. But there would still be some conditions, and monitoring of its banks by Brussels. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Three days on from Italy\u2019s constitutional referendum, the future of the country\u2019s weaker banks still hangs in the balance. Monte de Paschi di Siena (MPS), the oldest and most troubled of the Italian banks, is making a final push to persuade investors to back its \u20ac5bn cash call. But prime minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s resignation may force Monte dei Paschi into seeking some form of help from the state, as investors have been spooked by the uncertainty gripping the Italian political system. Reuters reported last night that the Italian government could take a \u20ac2bn controlling stake in MPS, which would lift the government\u2019s stake up to 40%. That could also provide compensation for the small retail investors who hold some of its bonds. And there is still talk that a public rescue plan could be cobbled together by the weekend, possibly even with some fund from Europe? All may become clearer today... #NoPromises Also coming up today: The European Commission could hit HSBC, JPMorgan and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole with multimillion-euro fines later today for rigging the Euribor interest rate benchmark. Australia has sent a shiver through the global economy by reporting that its economy shrank by 0.5% in the last quarter; only the fourth such decline in 25 years. Here\u2019s how the story unfolded: On the economic front, we get: German industrial production for October (just released, more on that shortly) UK industrial production for October. at 9.30am GMT The NIESR think tank estimates UK GDP for September-November, at 3pm GMT",

Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most EU member states would relish overhauling a relic of old times like the ban on Sunday shopping. In Greece, though, it is the sort of measure that makes for front-page splashes, conspiracy theory and cries of protest. </p> <p>But the International Monetary Fund, in the spirit of further opening up one of the continent\u2019s most sclerotic economies, is not letting go. Instead the Washington-based body, which is still negotiating its participation in Greece\u2019s latest bailout, has stepped up demands for trade to be liberalised saying shops should remain open on Sundays. Moreover, it argues, the reform will give people work in a nation hobbled by record levels of unemployment. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee0ef26b8d2e15ff056b047891469ac5449d2090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee0ef26b8d2e15ff056b047891469ac5449d2090/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"IMF wants Greek shops to open on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">IMF wants Greek shops to open on Sunday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In its splash today, the daily Ethnos newspaper, citing a leaked email from the IMF, reports that closure of an ongoing review of the economy by creditors \u2013 the second since Athens received its third bailout last summer \u2013 is now contingent on shops opening up for commerce on Sundays. The organisation wants the measure to be signed and sealed this month. So far the response has been negative. Ministry of finance officials told the paper that, instead, they will push through an amendment that will allow shops in specially defined tourist areas to stay open. That\u2019s unlikely to pass muster with lenders who have signalled they are going to rachet up the pressure on Greece to enforce the sort of reforms that will make it more competitive. Ideologically, the governing leftwing Syriza party is said to be against the move on the grounds that it will not only benefit bigger stores but is an infringement of basic workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>The Greek Orthodox Church has already likened the step to a sin and shop employees, who have already taken to the streets, are girding for further battle.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584839aee4b06a0d55b18805\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-07T16:33:15.178Z\">4.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s our full story on Matteo Renzi planning to resign later as Italian prime minister:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/07/matteo-renzi-to-resubmit-resignation-as-italys-prime-minister\">'Thanks to all and long live Italy' \u2013 PM Matteo Renzi tenders resignation again</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5848345ce4b04a74f27810dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-07T16:13:41.222Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the factors supporting the market rally is the expectation that the European Central Bank could announce an extension of its bond buying programme following its latest meeting on Thursday:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/806530987979141124\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Goldman expects ECB to deliver dovish message at Thur&#39;s meeting by extending APP until Dec2017 at curr pace of \u20ac80bn as real rates has risen <a href=\"https://t.co/QrIaSdUGYB\">pic.twitter.com/QrIaSdUGYB</a></p>&mdash; Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/806530987979141124\">December 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><em>[APP is the asset purchase programme]</em></p> <p>That hope, and optimism that Italy\u2019s struggling banks can somehow be recapitalised, have combined to send European markets higher, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.8%, France\u2019s Cac 1.1%, the FTSE 100 1.6% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB 1.5%.</p> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intra-day record of 19,276, despite concerns about healthcare companies after Donald Trump said he would look at drug pricing.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58482d82e4b06a0d55b187b7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-07T15:42:16.061Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tata Steel commits to Port Talbot</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the UK and some good news for steel workers at Port Talbot:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GrahamtRuddick/status/806522797203791872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Steel unions say Tata Steel has committed to blast furnaces at Port Talbot and will invest \u00a31bn into business, saving thousands of jobs</p>&mdash; Graham Ruddick (@GrahamtRuddick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrahamtRuddick/status/806522797203791872\">December 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GrahamtRuddick/status/806523150985023488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Unions also say Tata has committed to no compulsory redundancies for at least five years in UK business</p>&mdash; Graham Ruddick (@GrahamtRuddick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrahamtRuddick/status/806523150985023488\">December 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GrahamtRuddick/status/806523381432647680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tata Steel will close the British Steel pension scheme and launch new a defined contribution scheme</p>&mdash; Graham Ruddick (@GrahamtRuddick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrahamtRuddick/status/806523381432647680\">December 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584828b5e4b08659393b9cd5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-07T15:21:42.048Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets continue to be buoyed by hopes of a resolution to Italy\u2019s banking problems.

But it warned a slowdown was ahead.<br></p> <p>The think tank said the economy was being supported by the service sector, which was borne out by the earlier weak manufacturing figures. Rebecca Piggott, research fellow at NIESR, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recent economic growth has been driven almost entirely by the UK\u2019s broad service sector, supported by robust consumer spending. In stark contrast, the official figures suggest that the production and construction sectors of the economy have declined over recent months.</p> <p>Looking ahead, we do not expect such buoyant consumer spending growth to persist. Sterling\u2019s pronounced depreciation this year is expected to pass through to the consumer prices throughout the course of 2017 and 2018, eroding the purchasing power of households substantially.</p> </blockquote> <p>NIESR\u2019s latest quarterly forecast published just over a month ago forecast GDP growth of 2% per annum in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017.

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Fitch Ratings has revised the 2017 sector outlook for Irish banks to stable from positive, as the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU increases uncertainty for the operating environment. Ireland\u2019s economic recovery should remain strong in the short term, underpinning the stable sector outlook. The rating outlook on Irish banks is positive, reflecting our expectation that improving bank credit fundamentals should outweigh these challenges.</p> <p> Brexit is negative for Ireland\u2019s long-term economic and political prospects, putting pressure on GDP growth and creating uncertainty around relations with Northern Ireland. The extent of any weakening of the bank operating environment, triggered by a slowdown of GDP growth in the UK, sterling depreciation, or potential trade barriers, will become clear only as EU-UK negotiations develop. A deterioration in the operating environment could slow any improvements in the asset quality and capitalisation of Irish banks...</p> <p>Capitalisation, although improving, remains vulnerable. We expect capital ratios to strengthen in 2017, despite pressure from volatility in pension fund deficits and foreign-exchange markets. Fully-loaded regulatory capital ratios remain weaker than international peers, primarily due to large amounts of deferred tax assets; these assets are reducing slowly because of Ireland\u2019s low corporate tax rate and relatively low levels of profitability compared to the size of the balance sheet. Large, albeit reducing, stocks of unreserved problem assets also leave Irish banks\u2019 capitalisation more exposed if the operating environment deteriorates.</p> <p> Further improvements in asset quality and capitalisation would improve the banks\u2019 risk profiles and may result in ratings upgrades; this is why the ratings outlook for Irish banks is positive. Although uncertainty as regards the operating environment has increased, we believe credit fundamentals will improve in 2017, as the sector continues to work through its backlog of impaired loans. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58480e3fe4b08659393b9c28\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-07T14:24:10.255Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But...

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A 500-year-old brewery is selling off its vats, pumps and bottling lines at auction as its billionaire Singaporean owner prepares to turn the site into luxury flats. The Mortlake brewery in south-west London began brewing beer for the local monastery in 1487 and is thought to be among the oldest continuously operating businesses in Britain. The site, including millions of pounds of brewing equipment, was sold for \u00a3158m last year by global drinks firm ABInBev to developer Reselton, part of the property empire of Kwek Leng Beng. It is to be turned into a luxury riverside residential development stretching along 200 metres of the Thames at Richmond. Auctioneer Eddisons, which is managing the sale, said it expects a number of global brewing firms to compete for equipment including 2,000-litre brewing vats, malt blowers and bottling lines. The equipment was usedto produce brands such as Budweiser and Michelob at a rate of 60,000 bottles an hour until it halted production last year. ABInBev had first earmarked the brewery for closure in 2009 as it sought savings after its creation via the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch. Before its modern incarnation churning out beers for the mass market, the Mortlake brewery boasted a long and colourful history at the heart of the development of British brewing. From its 15th-century monastic beginnings, the brewery did not grow into a commercial business until the 18th century with the advent of steam-driven machinery. In the 19th century, it brewed beer to be delivered to British troops in India and the Crimea, before being bought at the end of the century by the Watney family. The Watney brewery that grew out of this acquisition went on to produce Red Barrel, one of the best known beers of the 1960s and 70s, with the site renamed the Stag brewery. Watneys briefly rebranded its famous beer \u201cRed\u201d in an attempt to appeal to young leftwing protesters against the Vietnam war. The rebrand, which ultimately failed, was backed by advertising campaigns featuring lookalikes of Fidel Castro, Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev quaffing ale. In its modern incarnation, under the ownership of ABInBev since 1991, the brewery operated using modern brewing equipment manufactured by firms such as Steinecker and Siemens. Eddisons said it was accepting bids for individual pieces of equipment or for all of the brewery\u2019s assets, which ABInBev left behind when it sold the site. The auction will take place in January, wiping away the last traces of Mortlake\u2019s association with beer. Because Mortlake\u2019s did not start commercial operations until 200 years after it came into existence, it is not considered the UK\u2019s oldest brewery. That honour goes to Shepherd Neame, founded in 1698 in Kent, although the 318-year-old brewery is still a spring chicken compared with the Weihenstephan brewery in Germany, which began making beer in 1040.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata Steel and trade union leaders have agreed a deal to save 8,000 jobs in the steel industry and the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. The jobs have been at risk since March when Tata Steel announced it was putting its UK business up for sale amid losses of more than \u00a31m a day. The decision sparked a political crisis as the government scrambled to secure the future of the plant. Port Talbot is one of only two sites in Britain that makes steel in blast furnaces. There are 4,000 steelworkers at Port Talbot and thousands more at other Tata Steel sites across the country. However, the rescue plan could still fall apart if the UK workers reject changes to their pension arrangements. The Indian company is yet to confirm how it will fund their existing benefits \u2013 with the scheme at risk of entering the Pension Protection Fund, which would result in a 10% cut to members\u2019 benefits. The British Steel pension scheme (BSPS) has liabilities of more than \u00a315bn and 130,000 members. Tata Steel wants to shut the final salary pension scheme and replace it with a less generous defined contribution scheme. Steel workers will vote on the plan in the new year, although union leaders and trustees for the pension scheme have given it their backing. In exchange for overhauling the pensions, Tata Steel has committed to production at Port Talbot and its other sites. This includes a guarantee that two blast furnaces at Port Talbot will remain in operation for at least five years, \u00a31bn will be invested into the business, and the company will try to avoid compulsory redundancies for five years. The company has agreed the package with the Community, GMB and Unite unions after months of negotiations. Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of Community, said: \u201cThe past year has been incredibly difficult for steelworkers and their families. When Tata announced in March that they planned to sell the steelworks, no one knew if they would have a job by Christmas. This proposal would secure jobs for years to come and bring serious investment not just to Port Talbot but to steelworks across the UK.\u201d Tata Steel warned that the industry was still under pressure and the UK business faced a battle to become sustainable. The company remains in talks with German rival ThyssenKrupp about merging their European steel operations. Koushik Chatterjee, group executive director, said: \u201cThese are unprecedented times for the steel industry globally with multiple risks including global economic uncertainty, slow manufacturing growth and currency volatility which continues to present significant challenges to the business. \u201cThere is much more work to be done to make Tata Steel UK more financially sustainable, but I am confident that all stakeholders will do all they can to try to ensure that the company will be able to achieve its plan in the coming months and years. \u201cThe proposed changes to future pension provision and other employment terms are necessary to derisk the company and help achieve long-term sustainability. We are also working separately on a necessary structural solution for the British Steel pension scheme fund.\u201d The announcement was welcomed by politicians, including the local MPs who have led the campaign to secure the future of Tata Steel UK. Stephen Kinnock, MP for Aberavon, which includes Port Talbot, said: \u201cThe production, jobs and investment elements of this deal represent a historic victory for pragmatic trade unionism, and for the power of united and concerted campaigning by steelworkers, steel communities, and steel MPs. \u201cBut let\u2019s be clear: this deal has been struck in spite of, not because of, the government. The government only began to engage with the steel industry when it became a public relations disaster for them.\u201d However, he warned there were serious questions and concerns about the pension scheme. The government is understood to be cautious about celebrating the announcement until the pension changes are approved by workers. It has U-turned on plans to change the law so that Tata Steel can restructure the scheme by moving it into a new vehicle and shifting the annual inflation-linked increase in benefits to a lower CPI measure rather than RPI. Instead the government will now not interfere in the restructuring and will leave it to Tata, pension trustees and the Pensions Regulator. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said: \u201cThis is an important step forward in achieving a sustainable long term future for steel making at Port Talbot. The government will continue to work with all parties in achieving this shared goal.\u201d Pensions experts warned that Tata Steel had done little to tackle the deficit and existing liabilities already in the scheme. John Ralfe, a pension consultant, said: \u201cTata Steel is making annual cash contributions for new defined-benefit pension promises of 11.5% of salary versus 10% for the replacement defined-contribution scheme, so closing the defined-benefit scheme saves virtually nothing for the company. \u201cBecause major disposals have reduced Tata Steel\u2019s creditworthiness, the pension trustees should demand higher deficit contributions, so the total annual cash contribution could easily go up. Closing the defined-benefit scheme does nothing to address the existing \u00a315bn of liabilities.\u201d The trustees said the scheme was very likely to enter the PPF unless the deficit was reduced. The deficit was measured at as much as \u00a3700m earlier this year but has reduced to around \u00a350m owing to movements in government bond yields and the fall in the value of sterling. Allan Johnston, chairman of the trustee board, said: \u201cOptions for separating BSPS [the pension scheme] from Tata Steel were outlined in the Government\u2019s consultation document in May. All of these options required closure of the BSPS to future accrual. \u201cThe trustee is in constructive discussions with Tata Steel, HM government and the Pensions Regulator about the options in the consultation. \u201cAlthough the trustee was not involved in the negotiations between Tata Steel and the trade unions about closure of the BSPS, today\u2019s announcement is an important step towards achieving the best possible outcome for the scheme and its members. \u201cThe trustee remains confident that the assets it holds are more than enough to pay the proposed modified benefits, which would be a better outcome than PPF compensation for the vast majority of members.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ikea has pledged to invest \u20ac1bn (\u00a3850m) in recycling companies and forests after netting \u20ac5.2bn from the sale of its product development and supply chain business. The deal between the retailer and Inter Ikea, a group set up by Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of Ikea, which controls the brand and design trademarks behind his empire, was revealed as the furniture retailer reported a 7.4% rise in annual global sales to \u20ac35.1bn, boosted by 29% growth online to \u20ac1.4bn. Net profit rose nearly 20% to \u20ac4.2bn as Ikea said it saw growth in 27 of its 28 markets, with China one of the fastest growing. Last week Ikea said sales in the UK were up 8.9% year on year to \u00a31.7bn for the 12 months to the end of August. The company, which has 340 stores, 22 pick-up and order points and 41 shopping centres around the world, said it would pay a dividend of \u20ac840m to its owner, the Stichting Ingka Foundation, a Netherlands-based trust, in the next year. Ikea did not pay a dividend last year. The group\u2019s 163,600 staff will also share \u20ac443m in bonuses and loyalty payments including a \u00a31,200 loyalty bonus paid into the pension pot of British staff who have worked for the company for five years or longer. Ikea Group\u2019s cash pile was boosted by nearly 40% to \u20ac23.1bn by the \u20ac5.2bn deal with Inter Ikea. The company said: \u201cOur strong financial position enables us to continue investments in co-workers, our stores, digital technology, the distribution network, as well as shopping centres and renewable energy.\u201d Ikea opened its first new store in the UK in seven years in 2016 \u2013 in Reading \u2013 and is currently planning outlets in Sheffield, Greenwich and Exeter. It also plans to open its first store in India \u2013 in Hyderabad \u2013 next year and is also planning a move into Serbia. As part of a series of sustainability pledges, Ikea said it would also be investing \u20ac1bn in buying forests as well as companies active in recycling, renewable energy development and biomaterials. It already owns 74,700 hectares of forest in Romania and the Baltic countries and has phased out the use of polystyrene packaging in favour of recyclable alternatives, except for around kitchen appliances. The investment comes on top of \u20ac600m pledged last year for investment in renewable energy as Ikea works towards energy independence by 2020. By the end of this year, the company has committed to own and operate 327 wind turbines and to install 730,000 solar panels on its buildings worldwide. It produced the equivalent to 71% of energy used in its operations. But the latest deal with Inter Ikea is likely to prompt further scrutiny of Ikea\u2019s already controversial tax structure. Under a complex international structure partly designed to save taxes, the furniture retailer pays Inter Ikea, the Liechtenstein-based group set up by Kamprad to secure the long-term future of his business, an annual franchise fee worth 3% of sales. Inter Ikea now controls the group\u2019s manufacturing facilities, its product design, advertising and distribution network so that Ikea Group is purely focused on stores. The deal comes as a raft of changes designed to block multinationals from aggressive tax structures come into force. Many companies are unwinding complex corporate arrangements that have saved them large amounts of tax for many years. Research commissioned by the Green/EFA group in the European parliament claims to show that Ikea \u201cstructured itself to dodge \u20ac1bn in taxes over the last six years using onshore European tax havens\u201d. Ikea has said it was \u201cfully committed to manage its operations in a responsible and sustainable way and we pay our taxes in full compliance with national and international tax rules and regulations\u201d.",

The TV advert \u2013 which will debut on 16 December \u2013 follows more than six decades of campaigns by the company including recent ads featuring Simon the Ogre and Miles the Bear. The group helped drive the popularity of cheap \u201csun and sangria\u201d package holidays to Spain in the 1970s, offering breaks to Benidorm for as little as \u00a337. \u201cThe campaign forms part of an important brand migration programme as Thomson establishes itself as a global travel leader in the UK before transitioning to Tui later next year,\u201d said the marketing director, Jeremy Ellis. \u201cWhile the 2016 film may be the final Thomson sign-off, we remain committed to bringing our customers with us on this journey while we continue to offer quality, modern and more personalised getaways you would expect from a holiday company with over 60 years of heritage in the industry.\u201d The theme of the final campaign underlines the importance of enjoying important holiday moments with loved ones. The advert features a little girl walking from the beach towards her father in a swimming pool \u2013 with \u201cmoments\u201d frozen around her \u2013 before finally jumping into his arms. In July Thomson and its sister brand First Choice (a brand name which will survive the restructure) announced plans to ditch their traditional holiday brochures by 2020, as customers demand increasingly sophisticated interactive digital experiences to help them choose and book their breaks.

The new advertising campaign is gearing up for so-called \u201cSunshine Saturday\u201d \u2013 the second Saturday in January \u2013 which typically attracts large numbers of holiday bookings from consumers wanting to cheer themselves up with a break. With UK customers\u2019 spending money squeezed due to exchange rate volatility, the group expects all-inclusive holidays \u2013 which account for 60% of First Choice\u2019s business \u2013 to continue to be popular next year.",

      "bodyText": "Upheaval in Whitehall departments after the Brexit vote and change of government has caused a slowdown in orders for Carillion, the building support services company. In a trading update, Carillion said it expected the value of orders and probable orders for the second half of 2016 to be lower than the \u00a32.5bn achieved in the first half. Carillion, which maintains roads, railways and military bases, said government business slowed after the vote to leave the EU on 23 June and the change of government. The result triggered a reorganisation of Whitehall departments and a spending hiatus before the new chancellor\u2019s autumn statement last month. Carillion is the latest support services company to blame Brexit-related uncertainty for a slowdown in business. Mitie and Capita have issued profit warnings after customers delayed spending because of post-referendum jitters. Carillion said: \u201cThe pace of new order intake has slowed in the second half. We believe this is due in part to the changes within UK government departments following the EU referendum result, as they reassessed their spending priorities.\u201d The company\u2019s shares fell as much as 6% in early trading on Wednesday after the announcement and were down 4% to 245p by late morning. Carillion said it expected projects to pick up again and that the slowdown was similar to conditions around the 2015 general election when projects were put on hold until departments had more certainty about policy. The company\u2019s work ranges from the completed expansion of Liverpool FC\u2019s main stand at Anfield to building the 670-bed Midlands Metropolitan hospital, which is scheduled for completion in 2018. UK public sector revenue of \u00a31.75bn last year was 38% of a total \u00a34.59bn. Carillion said it had also been affected by a slower pace of contract awards from the Middle East, particularly in Oman, as governments in the region cut spending in response to low oil prices. The Wolverhampton-based company said it expected results for the year to be in line with its forecasts despite the second-half slowdown in orders. But it said the outlook for revenue next year was less clear than at the same time in 2015. Revenue \u201cvisibility\u201d for 2017 is 70% compared with 84% a year ago, and Carillion\u2019s order book will be about \u00a316bn at the end of 2016, down from \u00a317.4bn a year earlier. The company said its order book did not include \u00a31.5bn of expected revenue from framework contracts, where it has an overall supply agreement with clients and takes on projects as they come up. It also suggested Philip Hammond\u2019s announcement of extra spending on road, rail and digital infrastructure could bring in more business. The company said: \u201cGiven the strength of our order book, framework contracts and pipeline of contract opportunities, we believe we are well positioned to make further progress in 2017.\u201d",

We believe this is due in part to the changes within UK government departments following the EU referendum result, as they reassessed their spending priorities.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s shares fell as much as 6% in early trading on Wednesday after the announcement and were down 4% to 245p by late morning.</p> <p>Carillion said it expected projects to pick up again and that the slowdown was similar to conditions around the 2015 general election when projects were put on hold until departments had more certainty about policy. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/dec/07/ftse-boosted-by-banks-and-miners-but-carillion-falls-on-brexit-order-delays\">FTSE boosted by banks and miners but Carillion falls on Brexit order delays</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company\u2019s work ranges from the completed expansion of Liverpool FC\u2019s main stand at Anfield to building the 670-bed Midlands Metropolitan hospital, which is scheduled for completion in 2018.

To put it mildly, this came as a shock to economic forecasters. Strong consumer demand, the fall in the value of sterling and, especially, strong survey evidence, had all pointed to rising factory production. It didn\u2019t happen. The weak performance of manufacturing was compounded by North Sea oil output falling as a result of routine maintenance. It meant that industrial production, which includes the offshore and onshore energy sectors and mining and quarrying as well as the output from factories, was down by 1.3% between September and October. That represented the biggest one-month decline since September 2012, a period when the eurozone was going through a particularly acute crisis. The Office for National Statistics always warns against reading too much into the data for a single month and it seems highly probable that North Sea oil production will have bounced back in November.

Firstly, they mean that it will take a very strong performance in November and December to prevent a second successive quarterly fall in industrial production. Even a 1% increase in both months would result in a 0.1% decline in the fourth quarter. That would leave the sector, which accounts for 15% of economic output, in a technical recession. Secondly, the weakness seen in October cannot be dismissed as a one-off. Even if City economists are right in their belief that the outlook for UK manufacturing is brighter than the latest figures suggest, there is a lot of ground to make up. Manufacturing output in the three months to October was 5.7% below its level when the economy nosedived into recession in the first quarter of 2008.

      "bodyText": "A five-year investigation by competition authorities in Brussels into rigging of interest rates drew to a close on Wednesday when three major banks \u2013 including HSBC \u2013 were fined \u20ac485m (\u00a3412m) for colluding to manipulate a crucial benchmark rate. The three banks, which also included JP Morgan Chase and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, did not agree to an earlier settlement involving a seven-bank cartel over the setting of the interest rate known as Euribor. All three deny wrongdoing. JP Morgan was fined \u20ac337m, HSBC \u20ac33m and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole \u20ac114m. The levels were based on the time they participated in the cartel and the value of products involved. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, said: \u201cA sound and competitive financial sector is essential for investment and growth. Banks have to respect EU competition rules just like any other company operating in the single market.\u201d Four other banks \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 settled with the commission in 2013 for \u20ac820m. Those penalties came at a time when the industry was reeling from the rate-rigging scandal and the announcement on Wednesday served as a reminder of the misconduct matters that continue to plague the industry. The three banks fined on Wednesday had not participated in the 2013 settlement and JP Morgan said it was considering a possible appeal to the European court. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole said it would appeal. HSBC said it was considering its legal options. Vestager said the commission had found \u201cchats\u201d between traders congratulating themselves on setting the rate to levels that suited their means in a cartel which operated between September 2005 and May 2008. She described it as \u201ca closed community with a very free language\u201d. Financial regulators have previously published electronic correspondence with traders using colourful language as they encouraged each other to move interest rates. Euribor is the eurozone\u2019s version of Libor \u2013 the London interbank offered rate, which is ultimately used to value a range of financial products ranging from interest rates swaps between companies to mortgage products for households. \u201cThe traders\u2019 aim was to distort the normal course of pricing components for euro interest rate derivatives. They did this by telling each other their desired or intended Euribor submissions and by exchanging sensitive information on their trading positions or on their trading or pricing strategies,\u201d the commission said. \u201cThis means that the seven banks colluded instead of competing with each other on the euro derivatives market. This market is very important not only to banks but also to many companies in the single market, which use euro interest rate derivatives to hedge their financing risk,\u201d the commission added. The rate-rigging scandal erupted in June 2012 when Barclays was fined \u00a3290m by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, unleashing a wave of public anger about banks and sparking the parliamentary commissions into banking standards. It also led to a wave of other fines on banks and prompted the Treasury to change the rules so that the fines went to the exchequer rather than back to the regulator. The way the benchmarks are set has also been overhauled while criminal investigations have been launched. A spokesperson for JP Morgan said: \u201cWe have cooperated fully with the European commission throughout its five-year investigation. We did not engage in any wrongdoing with respect to the Euribor benchmark. We will continue to vigorously defend our position against these allegations, including through possible appeals to the European courts.\u201d HSBC said the decision related to \u201cpurported conduct\u201d during one month in early 2007. \u201cWe believe we did not participate in an anti-competitive cartel. We are reviewing the European commission\u2019s decision and considering our legal options,\u201dit said. \u201cCr\u00e9dit Agricole firmly believes that it did not infringe competition law,\u201d the French bank said. Just months after fines for Libor rigging were slapped on banks, it emerged that other markets were being manipulated. Vestager said an investigation into the manipulation of foreign exchange markets was continuing and was \u201ca very large complex case with many participants\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has been fined a record \u00a384.2m by the UK\u2019s competition regulator after the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug was increased by up to 2,600%. The Competition and Markets Authority, issuing its biggest fine, said the \u201cextraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds\u201d. The CMA also fined the drugs distributor Flynn Pharma \u00a35.2m for charging excessive and unfair prices in the UK for phenytoin sodium capsules, which are used by an estimated 48,000 epilepsy patients in the UK to prevent and control seizures. The watchdog has ordered both companies to drop their prices. US-based Pfizer rejected the CMA\u2019s findings. Both companies said they would appeal against the decision. The CMA has four other ongoing investigations into the pharmaceutical industry, with at least one of those focused on excessive pricing. The fines follow an overnight price increase for the drug of up to 2,600%, after it was deliberately debranded, the CMA said. Pfizer makes the drug and sells it to Flynn, which in turn sells it to the NHS. Before September 2012, Pfizer manufactured and sold phenytoin sodium capsules to UK wholesalers and pharmacies under the brand name Epanutin, and the price was regulated. In September 2012, Pfizer sold the UK distribution rights to Flynn Pharma, debranding the drug and making it generic. The drug was no longer subject to price regulation, leaving Pfizer free to sharply increase the price it charged Flynn, which in turn further raised the price it charged the NHS. Generic drugs are generally available to customers at cheaper prices than branded products because they can be manufactured by any company, not just the developer of the original drug. However, the CMA said that because epilepsy patients who are already taking phenytoin sodium capsules would not usually be switched to other products, including another manufacturer\u2019s version of the product, the NHS had no alternative but to pay the increased prices for the drug. The amount the NHS was charged for 100mg packs of the drug was increased from \u00a32.83 to \u00a367.50 before being reduced to \u00a354 from May 2014. As a result, the amount the NHS spent on phenytoin sodium capsules rocketed from about \u00a32m a year in 2012 to \u00a350m in 2013. The CMA also found that Pfizer, best known for its mass-market drugs such as Viagra, was charging a far higher price for the anti-epilepsy drug in the UK than in any other European country. Its fining of Pfizer is the highest imposed in UK competition law, reflecting the seriousness of the case, the watchdog said. The previous record was a \u00a358.5m fine handed to British Airways in 2012 for colluding with Virgin Atlantic on fuel surcharges. Philip Marsden, who led the investigation for the CMA, accused the Pfizer and Flynn Pharma of exploitation and said there was no justification for such price rises. Phenytoin sodium capsules are an old drug and there had been no recent innovation or significant investment, he said. Marsden added: \u201cThe companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients. These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds. \u201cThis is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behaviour and to protect customers.\u201d Pfizer defended its actions, saying the drugs were loss-making before they were debranded and distributed through Flynn Pharma. It also argued that the price was less than that of the equivalent medicine from another supplier to the NHS. A spokesman for the CMA said Pfizer recouped its losses on the medication within two months, adding that the price of other drugs did not permit the companies fined to charge \u201cexcessive and unfair prices\u201d. Pfizer said in a statement: \u201cPfizer refutes the findings set out in the Competition and Markets Authority decision. In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law. \u201cPhenytoin capsules were a loss-making product for Pfizer and the Flynn transaction represented an opportunity to secure ongoing supply of an important medicine for patients with epilepsy, while maintaining continuity of manufacture. \u201cPfizer believes the CMA\u2019s findings are wrong in fact and law and will be appealing all aspects of the decision.\u201d David Fakes, Flynn Pharma\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe believe that, left unchallenged, the CMA\u2019s decision today would stunt investment in generics, eventually leading to a reduction in supply and less choice for doctors and patients. It is a matter of common interest for us to appeal and see this decision overturned.\u201d Duncan Liddell, competition partner at the law firm Ashurst, said the CMA had decided to make a point by handing out a record fine. \u201cAmidst the manifold uncertainties of Brexit, there\u2019s a clear message here that boards should be including competition law compliance in their priorities for 2017.\u201d",

The watchdog has ordered both companies to drop their prices.<br></p> <p>US-based Pfizer rejected the CMA\u2019s findings.

Pfizer makes the drug and sells it to Flynn, which in turn sells it to the NHS. </p> <p>Before September 2012, Pfizer manufactured and sold phenytoin sodium capsules to UK wholesalers and pharmacies under the brand name Epanutin, and the price was regulated. In September 2012, Pfizer sold the UK distribution rights to Flynn Pharma, debranding the drug and making it generic.</p> <p>The drug was no longer subject to price regulation, leaving Pfizer free to sharply increase the price it charged Flynn, which in turn further raised the price it charged the NHS.</p> <p>Generic drugs are generally available to customers at cheaper prices than branded products because they can be manufactured by any company, not just the developer of the original drug.</p> <p>However, the CMA said that because epilepsy patients who are already taking phenytoin sodium capsules would not usually be switched to other products, including another manufacturer\u2019s version of the product, the NHS had no alternative but to pay the increased prices for the drug.</p> <p>The amount the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> was charged for 100mg packs of the drug was increased from \u00a32.83 to \u00a367.50 before being reduced to \u00a354 from May 2014. As a result, the amount the NHS spent on phenytoin sodium capsules rocketed from about \u00a32m a year in 2012 to \u00a350m in 2013.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The CMA also found that Pfizer, best known for its mass-market drugs such as Viagra, was charging a far higher price for the anti-epilepsy drug in the UK than in any other European country.</p> <p>Its fining of Pfizer is the highest imposed in UK competition law, reflecting the seriousness of the case, the watchdog said. The previous record was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/19/ba-fuel-surcharge-fine-oft\">a \u00a358.5m fine handed to British Airways in 2012</a> for colluding with Virgin Atlantic on fuel surcharges.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Philip Marsden, who led the investigation for the CMA, accused the Pfizer and Flynn Pharma of exploitation and said there was no justification for such price rises. Phenytoin sodium capsules are an old drug and there had been no recent innovation or significant investment, he said.</p> <p>Marsden added: \u201cThe companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients. These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThis is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behaviour and to protect customers.\u201d</p> <p>Pfizer defended its actions, saying the drugs were loss-making before they were debranded and distributed through Flynn Pharma. It also argued that the price was less than that of the equivalent medicine from another supplier to the NHS.</p> <p>A spokesman for the CMA said Pfizer recouped its losses on the medication within two months, adding that the price of other drugs did not permit the companies fined to charge \u201cexcessive and unfair prices\u201d.</p> <p>Pfizer said in a statement: \u201cPfizer refutes the findings set out in the Competition and Markets Authority decision.

Joyce used Wednesday\u2019s worse-than-expected GDP figures to urge Queenslanders to \u201cshow the same spunk you had when you developed the coalfields in the past, built international airports at Cairns, built the Wivenhoe dam, sealed the roads out west, built the Gold Coast\u201d. His enthusiastic backing for the contentious project contrasted with more obvious caution expressed by the treasurer, Scott Morrison, on Wednesday. Morrison told reporters in Canberra he did not intend to join commentary about whether the project should win support from the government\u2019s Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund. He said the independent advisory board of the fund needed to be left alone to do its job. \u201cI agree that it was set up to make independent assessments about the proposals. \u201cThey are the people to make those calls and I don\u2019t intend to join in in any commentary about what they should or shouldn\u2019t do, that would compromise the fundamental purpose of those people who have to make those assessments,\u201d the treasurer said. During the federal election, the government\u2019s position on the Adani project was that it should proceed, or not, on a commercial basis. But since the election, senior Nationals have pushed to have the project allocated $1bn from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund to bankroll a 388km railway line associated with the Carmichael mine. On Monday, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, met the Adani Group chairman, Gautam Adani, in Melbourne to discuss the project. Joyce used a speech in Brisbane on Wednesday to sing the praises of the controversial project, declaring Queensland needed to return to its pioneering spirit. The deputy prime minister seized on news that Australia\u2019s economy slipped backwards in the September quarter by a greater than expected 0.5%, to argue Australia needed development. \u201cWhen I hear people standing up against the development of central Queensland coalfields, the Adani mine, where is your alternate source of income going to come from?\u201d Joyce said. \u201cWe have had in this quarter negative growth. People say that\u2019s terrible. Let\u2019s talk about the solution. If you don\u2019t want that wealth, where is your alternate form of wealth going to come from?

      "bodyText": "Online shoppers will typically spend two-and-a-half hours sorting out a delivery problem this Christmas - because an item is late, turns up broken or doesn\u2019t arrive at all \u2013 Citizens Advice has warned. With the busiest shopping period of the year now under way, the national charity\u2019s latest consumer advice trends report reveals people experienced 4.8m delivery problems last year \u2013and spent 11.8m hours trying to sort them out. That is the equivalent of just under two-and-a-half hours per adult. Those who were subsequently not compensated were left \u00a3148m out of pocket \u2013 \u00a330 a parcel \u2013 because of damaged or lost goods, hours wasted and time away from work, the charity said. It is advising shoppers that it is retailers\u2019 responsibility to sort out delivery problems, not that of \u201cthird party\u201d parcel companies. Analysis of the more than 2,000 calls to Citizens Advice about deliveries in the past 12 months showed difficulty getting through to the delivery company was the most common problem, followed by confusion about responsibility and compensation and unexpected handling fees on parcels sent from outside the EU. As many as 390m parcels will be handled by private companies and Royal Mail between November and December this year. Citizens Advice is preparing for a rise in people seeking help for problems with deliveries. There was a 32% increase in calls about this issue between October and December 2015. And there was a 60% spike in people getting online help closer to Christmas on 18 December last year \u2013 as they try to track down missing gifts before the holiday. \u201cShopping online should make people\u2019s lives easier \u2013 but not if their items turn up damaged or don\u2019t arrive at all\u201d said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting more people to seek our help over the festive season as consumers try to track down gifts or look to get compensation for items that are broken or never arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s really important people know that if an item they\u2019ve ordered doesn\u2019t turn up \u2013 or if there is a problem with it \u2013 it is for the retailer to sort out. Businesses also need to make sure they are upholding people\u2019s rights by looking into delivery problems themselves instead of passing customers onto the parcel companies.\u201d Consumers are advised that if they are posting a gift, they should keep hold of the receipt so they can claim compensation for the item if anything goes wrong. They also also need proof of sending which can be obtained from the Post Office or postal delivery company. If valuables are being sent, Citizens Advice also recommends using an insured service such as Royal Mail\u2019s Special Delivery or shopping around for another postal service. Their terms and conditions will explain what is and isn\u2019t covered.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll be closing the blog shortly but here\u2019s a summary of the main points of the day: Australia\u2019s GDP shrank by 0.5% in the September quarter \u2013 only the fourth such decline in 25 years The slump was thanks partly to weak construction output and public spending, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Most analysts think GDP will be positive in the fourth quarter and for the country to avoid a technical recession But some still expect the Reserve Bank to cut the cash rate in 2017 to 1% The Aussie dollar has sunk 0.5%, buying US74.30c, while the ASX200 shrugged off the news \u2013 possibly because investors hope for more monetary stimulus Treasurer Scott Morrison says the GDP figures \u2018demand support for his policies of jobs and growth\u2019 Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen says the figures are \u2018deeply disappointing\u2019 Thanks for reading and for all your comments. Time for a market update. The dollar is still down around 0.5% at US74.30c as investors weigh up the increased possibility that the RBA will cut interest rates next year. Perhaps even twice, some think. The share market meanwhile, is much more positive and the ASX/S&amp;P200 has put on 0.8% today to sit at 5476.3 points. Stock markets across the region were mostly positive thanks to the Dow Jones average closing at another record high on Tuesday night. The Nikkei was up 0.6%, the Hang Seng 0.35% but the Kospi in Korea is down slightly. Steven Knight of the brokerage Blackwell Global has a broader analysis of the outlook for Australia, which he decribes as \u201cvulnerable\u201d because of the 12th successive quarterly drop in private investment. He thinks the pick up in oil, coal and iron ore prices in the past six months will cushion any continued lack of investment but the question is what happens when, if seems likely, demand for the big commodities levels off again: This highlights the lack of GDP diversity in the Australian economy and the fact that transition of capital to the services and retail industry has been sluggish at best. Australian growth needs to come from spending, investment and increased employment and it\u2019s difficult to see where that is likely to come from with expectations at the currently low level. Subsequently, today\u2019s GDP release is likely to be seen as a wake-up call to both the markets and the Reserve Bank of Australia. Although the RBA recently elected to keep the cash rate on hold at 1.50% the reality is that the latest round of data all but assures near term rate cuts. My view is that we are likely to see 50bps shaved from interest rates over the next six months in an attempt to provide some much-needed stimulus. The Guardian columnist Stephen Koukoulas agrees with the folk at Capital. He\u2019s just filed his thoughts on the GDP figures and points the finger at policy failures by the Coalition and the Reserve Bank \u2013 the former for cutting spending into a downturn in the economy and the latter for failing to spot the threat from deflation quickly enough and leaving rates too high. He writes: Quite obviously, the RBA should have cut interest rates earlier and harder, not least to free up cash flow for the business sector and indebted households but also to take some air out of the Australian dollar, which has been strong against most global currencies. It should and probably will cut interest rates again but will likely wait until its next meeting in February to do so. Better late than never. Staying with rates, and the number crunchers at Capital Economics reckon that the RBA will be forced to cut the cash rate to 1% next year and the dollar will drop below US70c. Although they think the economy will get back to growth in the fourth quarter \u2013 in line with most expectations \u2013 they see borrowing costs coming down again. This is only the fourth fall in GDP in 25 years, which highlights that the economic backdrop is not consistent with a big rise in underlying inflation. This supports our view that interest rates may fall from 1.5% to 1% next year, which could drag the Australian dollar below US$0.70. The question of where interest rates will go from here is likely to be much debated from now until the next Reserve Bank meeting in February. Craig James of CommSec said earlier that the GDP print meant that the recent talk of a possible rates hike was off the table. This what he said in his note: The Reserve Bank warned [on Tuesday] that annual economic growth would slow before it picked up in 2017. That is our expectation also. The economy should grow near its \u2018potential\u2019 rate of 3% in 2017. We continue to believe that interest rates will remain on hold in coming months. But no one will be thinking of rate hikes any time soon. The Coalition will be desperate to avoid Australia entering a slump with another negative print for the fourth quarter. The country\u2019s prized triple-AAA credit rating is already under threat and Scott Morrison will do his bext with his midyear fiscal and economic outlook on 19 December to persuade the rating agencies and the markets that he has the situation under control. Most analysts, including Shane Oliver from AMP and Craig James from CommSec, agree that today\u2019s number is likely to a one-off and that Australia will bounce back into positive territory next time. Ben Jarman at JP Morgan in Sydney is a little more circumspect. While he agrees that the weather-hit building industry should bounce back in the fourth quarter, household spending is weak and could drag on the overall figure. Consumer spending growth is 2% annualised over the last six months. This is occurring at a time where the business surveys have already soured somewhat and retail spending momentum has been fading. The breadth of the contraction in construction activity does indeed seem consistent with weather effects. At the least this makes a quarterly GDP growth outcome of 1% for 4Q17 achievable. And there is precedent for output consistently surging back after weather-related disruptions over several quarters: after a slight 0.2% contraction during the 2011 Queensland floods, which badly disrupted coal export output, GDP growth averaged 1.1% for four straight quarters. However, the level of weather disruption did not appear to be anywhere near that scale on this occasion, and the underlying trend in domestic demand back then was much stronger, as mining capex was in full flight. So much as the RBA governor yesterday positioned for a temporary lull in growth, with inflation very weak the rebound needs to be fast, and convincing. On the early tracking, the bounce-back in 4Q GDP is unlikely to be sufficient to avoid downward revisions in the RBA\u2019s February statement of monetary policy. Great chart courtesy of our friends at Business Insider showing the quarterly dips of the past 25 years. The trade minister, Steve Ciobo, has been speaking about the figures from Jakarta where he is on government business. He admits the numbers are disappointing but the government is focusing on policies to boost economic growth. This is what he told Bloomberg: Trade export deals are a key part of that and that\u2019s why as a Coalition we\u2019ve focused on locking into place very high-quality trade deals between Australia, South Korea, China and Japan. So the number is down and it\u2019s not what we would expect as ideal but our annualised growth rate still sits above the OECD average. Looking on the bright side, there are good reasons to think that the decline in GDP won\u2019t be repeated in the December quarter and that Australia will avoid slipping into recession. The main reason is that the terms of trade improved by 4.5% in the third quarter thanks to rising commodity prices. That trend has continued in recent weeks and should benefit the bottom line when the next round of GDP figures come out in the new year. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, said: I see this as a one-off because some of the factors which dragged down growth were reversed in the current quarter. Housing and public investment will bounce back, retail spending has recently picked up pace and the boom in resource exports will resume. Australia\u2019s GDP has shrunk by 0.5% in the September quarter thanks to a slump in construction output and weak public spending It\u2019s only the fourth such decline in the past 25 years The Aussie dollar has sunk 0.5%, buying US74.26c, while the ASX200 shrugs off the news on the hope of more stimulus Treasurer Scott Morrison says the figures \u2018demand support for his policies of jobs and growth\u2019 Commsec chief economist Craig James says it\u2019s a \u201cperfect storm\u201d The ASX/S&amp;P 200 has taken the poor GDP reading in its stride with miners and banks driving the benchmark index higher today. It\u2019s currently up 32.9 points at 5,461.60, a rise of 0.61%. That\u2019s a result of the \u201cbad news is good news\u201d paradox that has gripped the financial markets since the end of the world\u2019s central banks started their various money-printing schemes in 2008 ie, the worse the news is from the real world, the more stocks bounce in the hope that the bad news will force central banks to kickstart the economy. Reuters quotes Tony Farnham, an economist with Patersons Securities: The poor GDP data has people expecting more accommodating policy. The accommodation can be either through friendlier monetary policy or alternatively it could be increased fiscal policy, by that I mean increased government expenditure ideally in the capex side and infrastructure side. For more on the bad news/good news conundrum, here\u2019s some analysis from our economics editor Larry Elliott from earlier in the year. The GDP contraction has taken a chunk out of the Aussie dollar. It has fallen 0.46% against the US dollar to US74.26c. It\u2019s also fallen against other currencies, including a drop of 0.31% against the pound. It\u2019s buying 58.65p at the moment. My colleague Gareth Hutchens has written our main news story on the GDP figures which you can read here. He\u2019s got lots of reaction, including this from James Pearson, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who has called for corporate tax cuts. Australia must not be like the frog in the pot of water that is slowly brought to boil. To regain our competitiveness, and therefore create and sustain jobs, we must encourage our businesses, which employ most Australian workers, to invest and grow. That includes by cutting the burden of company tax to stimulate investment. The 0.5% contraction has surprised a lot of people because the consensus forecast among economists was 0.2%, according to those surveyed by Australian Associated press. TD Securities chief Asia-Pacific macro strategist Annette Beacher told AAP that the Reserve Bank would now be trying to work out whether Australia was halfway to a recession, which is defined by two quarters of economic contraction. I think they\u2019ll be spending the afternoon figuring out to what extent are these one-offs, and can we get rebound in [the fourth quarter]. Will private consumption rebound, will the dwelling sector rebound, will the public sector rebound? They\u2019ll be spending more time looking at that.\u201d However, Beacher said she thought the dips across the different sectors such as construction and federal capital spending, were more likely an unfortunate coincidence that makes a Christmas recession unlikely. Commsec\u2019s chief economist Craig James says the figures will turn out to be a blip, \u201cbut a very important blip\u201d. Australians of all stripes have become complacent, he says, and have stopped spending and investing. Infrastructure spending will have to take its place to provide \u201cmomentum\u201d for the economy in the coming months. But overall he blamed the uncertainty generated by Brexit and Trump for the decline in GDP. In the September quarter the economy was hit by a perfect storm. Not only was there the reaction to the UK \u2018Brexit\u2019 vote, there was also the federal election and then there was the uncertainty about the US elections. And clearly, when there is a lot of uncertainty around, consumers and businesses tend to delay decisions to spend, invest and employ. A big fall in public investment also accounted for the bulk of the contraction of activity in the quarter. While spending measures of the economy were weak in the September quarter, income measures were actually quite strong. And the farm sector was also strong in the quarter and should also be a key contributor to growth in coming quarters. We don\u2019t believe there are grounds for another quarter of contraction. The shadow treasurer is speaking in Canberra now and he\u2019s talking about the \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d figures that Scott Morrison \u201ccould hardly bring himself to mention\u201d. After a fair bit of qualification he calls it the \u201csecond worst economic performance for 25 years\u201d and calls on Morrison to take responsibility for the problem. The fact of the matter is that this is just the fourth negative quarter in 100 quarters in Australia. Just the fourth negative quarter since 1991. And in fact, the only other occasions that this has occurred over the last 25 years, there have been very good and clear reasons for it. For example, in 2011 Australia was dealing with Cyclone Yasi. In 2009, the greatest economic downturn since the great depression internationally. And of course the aftermath of the Sydney Olympics. Now, in other words, this is the second worst economic growth result in the last 25 years. Morrison says the figures aren\u2019t just a wake up call, but rather serve as a \u201cdemand\u201d for everyone else to support his policies for jobs and growth. Here\u2019s more from his opening remarks to the press conference which has just ended: The Turnbull government will never take economic growth for granted, ever. In the 12 months to the end of September our economy grew by 1.8%. That\u2019s down from 3.1% achieved at the end of June. Our growth is still higher than six out of seven G7 economies, second only to the United Kingdom, higher than the US, Canada, Japan, Germany and higher than the OECD average. The contraction recorded in real GDP in the September quarter is not just a reminder, not just a wake up call or a warning about being complacent when it comes to economic growth. It is a demand to support economic policies that drive the investment needed for job security, the hours and wages that hard-working Australians need to cope with the rising cost of living, especially on electricity costs, and that businesses need to survive in a tough and competieve environment. Today\u2019s nationals accounts data demmands the support in the national interest for the government\u2019s economic plan for jobs and growth that we outlined this year. It demands it in the national interest. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has fronted the media in Canberra to try to explain the dire figures which show the annual growth rate down to 1.8 per cent. The figures are not just a reminder or a wake-up call about being complacent, but rather a \u201cdemand to support economic policies that drive the investment needed to support job security\u201d, Morrison said. The ABS is fairly clear about the reasons for the shrinking of the economy. In its press release on the figures, it says the 3.6% decline in output of the construction industry \u201cwas the largest contributor to the fall in GDP growth\u201d on an industry basis. It said other industries such as financial and insurance services, professional scientific and technical services, rental hiring and real estate services and administrative support services also contributed to the overall decline. Here\u2019s the full statement: The volume of activity in the Australian economy decreased 0.5% in the September quarter 2016, the first quarter of negative growth since the Queensland flood affected March quarter 2011. Through the year growth remains positive at 1.8%, reflecting the three previous quarters of growth. Economic activity contracted in a number of areas this quarter. Private investment in new buildings detracted 0.3 percentage points from GDP growth, while new engineering and new and used dwellings detracted 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points respectively. Public capital expenditure detracted 0.5 percentage points from growth as it declined from elevated levels in the June quarter. Net exports detracted an additional 0.2 percentage points from growth. Australia\u2019s terms of trade rose 4.5% through the September quarter. The reduced building activity is reflected in the output of the construction industry which fell 3.6% for the quarter and was the largest contributor to the fall in GDP growth on an industry basis. A number of other industries also recorded below trend growth, or declined, this quarter, including financial and insurance services, professional scientific and technical services, rental hiring and real estate services and administrative support services. The largest offset to these falls was agriculture which grew 7.5 per cent. Mining production contributed no growth, but maintained its historically high levels of production. Subdued activity in the building industry contributed to a decline in the income of small businesses, with gross mixed income down 5.8%. Private non-financial corporation\u2019s gross operating surplus increased 1.2%, supported by stronger mining commodity prices. Compensation of employees increased 1.3%, and real gross national income increased 0.9% for the quarter to be 3.2% higher through the year. The ABS bad news for the Aussie dollar which fell sharply on the news and is currently trading at US74.24c. Stock market investors were more sanguine, however, with the ASX/S&amp;P 200 index up 0.5% on the morning. Good morning and welcome to the live blog on reaction to the surprisingly poor GDP figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics today. They showed that the economy shrank by 0.5% in the three months to the end of September, the first negative quarter for five years and only the fourth for more than two decades. I\u2019ll be bringing you reaction from Canberra and the rest of the country, plus everything from the markets. Here\u2019s our first news story from Gareth Hutchens in Canberra.",

At the least this makes a quarterly GDP growth outcome of 1% for 4Q17 achievable. And there is precedent for output consistently surging back after weather-related disruptions over several quarters: after a slight 0.2% contraction during the 2011 Queensland floods, which badly disrupted coal export output, GDP growth averaged 1.1% for four straight quarters.</p> <p>However, the level of weather disruption did not appear to be anywhere near that scale on this occasion, and the underlying trend in domestic demand back then was much stronger, as mining capex was in full flight. So much as the RBA governor yesterday positioned for a temporary lull in growth, with inflation very weak <strong>the rebound needs to be fast, and convincing</strong>.

      "bodyText": "When gross domestic product and employment fall, it is usually the result of a policy error or an external shock to the economy. An external shock can be ruled out as global GDP growth and financial markets have performed well during 2015 and 2016. This means that the economic weakness now being seen is the result of a policy error. Today\u2019s September quarter national accounts confirmed a quite stunning 0.5% fall in GDP, which, with hindsight, dovetails with the recent labour force data that shows employment having fallen 25,700 since July. Something has gone wrong. While the Reserve Bank did cut interest rates in May and August this year, at 1.5% Australian interest rates are among the highest in the industrialised world. The RBA was reluctant to cut because it did not believe the rapid deceleration in inflation to be anything other than a temporary phenomenon and it looked at the growth side of the economy, including wages growth, with rose-coloured glasses, which meant it was generally expecting GDP and employment growth to \u201ceventually\u201d pick up. For the same reason, it also placed little weight on the run of unexpectedly low inflation results. Quite obviously, the RBA should have cut interest rates earlier and harder, not least to free up cash flow for the business sector and indebted households but also to take some air out of the Australian dollar, which has been strong against most global currencies. It should and probably will cut interest rates again but will likely wait until its next meeting in February to do so. Better late than never. For the Turnbull government, the quest to cut public spending and rake in growing tax receipts as it strives for a return to budget surplus might need to be recalibrated. When private-sector demand is weak, as the national accounts clearly show, good policy is to have government step in and fill the void, preferably with targeted infrastructure spending. Indeed, it could now be argued that the efforts to cut spending and hike various taxes has been the wrong policy at the wrong time. It is a basic rule of prudent economic policy to have the government sector provide the shock absorber for the economy by having stimulatory economic policy when growth in private-sector demand is soft or downright weak and then tighten policy when activity on the private sector is strong. Alas, for the Coalition, it seems keen to move the budget to surplus with scant regard to the state of the business cycle. Importantly, all is not lost for the economy. The RBA can (and probably will) cut interest rates in the new year. The government is lucky that it cannot get many of its growth-sapping measures through the Senate as success would take money out of the economy just when a cash injection is needed. In addition, the global economy is looking sound with growth in the major countries being sustained and financial market conditions being supportive of future strength. Commodity prices are also strong, a factor that should help to underpin incomes and export revenues through 2016. For that the government should be grateful. The lessons of the rapid deterioration in economic conditions in Australia over the past few months are that policymakers need to err on the side of growth-promoting policies and to have more faith in hard economic news than the model-based forecasts. If the RBA had reacted more full to the inflation results, the cash rate now would likely be somewhere around 0.5 to 0.75%, the Australian dollar would be materially weaker and growth noticeably higher. It is to be hoped the lesson is learned.",

Something has gone wrong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/07/australian-economy-dollar-tumbles-after-worse-than-expected-gdp-figures-live\">Australian economy: 'perfect storm' produces worse than expected GDP figures \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2016/aug/02/reserve-bank-of-australia-rba-meets-to-decide-on-cash-rate-live\">While the Reserve Bank did cut interest rates in May and August this year</a>, at 1.5% Australian interest rates are among the highest in the industrialised world. The RBA was reluctant to cut because it did not believe the rapid deceleration in inflation to be anything other than a temporary phenomenon and it looked at the growth side of the economy, including wages growth, with rose-coloured glasses, which meant it was generally expecting GDP and employment growth to \u201ceventually\u201d pick up. For the same reason, it also placed little weight on the run of unexpectedly low inflation results.</p> <p>Quite obviously, the RBA should have cut interest rates earlier and harder, not least to free up cash flow for the business sector and indebted households but also to take some air out of the Australian dollar, which has been strong against most global currencies.</p> <p>It should and probably will cut interest rates again but will likely wait until its next meeting in February to do so. Better late than never.</p> <p>For the Turnbull government, the quest to cut public spending and rake in growing tax receipts as it strives for a return to budget surplus might need to be recalibrated. When private-sector demand is weak, as the national accounts clearly show, good policy is to have government step in and fill the void, preferably with targeted infrastructure spending.</p> <p>Indeed, it could now be argued that the efforts to cut spending and hike various taxes has been the wrong policy at the wrong time. It is a basic rule of prudent economic policy to have the government sector provide the shock absorber for the economy by having stimulatory economic policy when growth in private-sector demand is soft or downright weak and then tighten policy when activity on the private sector is strong.</p> <p>Alas, for the Coalition, it seems keen to move the budget to surplus with scant regard to the state of the business cycle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/07/australian-economy-shrinks-by-05-in-september-quarter\">Australian GDP: economy shrinks by 0.5% in September quarter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Importantly, all is not lost for the economy. The RBA can (and probably will) cut interest rates in the new year. The government is lucky that it cannot get many of its growth-sapping measures through the Senate as success would take money out of the economy just when a cash injection is needed.</p> <p>In addition, the global economy is looking sound with growth in the major countries being sustained and financial market conditions being supportive of future strength. Commodity prices are also strong, a factor that should help to underpin incomes and export revenues through 2016. For that the government should be grateful. </p> <p>The lessons of the rapid deterioration in economic conditions in Australia over the past few months are that policymakers need to err on the side of growth-promoting policies and to have more faith in hard economic news than the model-based forecasts. </p> <p>If the RBA had reacted more full to the inflation results, the cash rate now would likely be somewhere around 0.5 to 0.75%, the Australian dollar would be materially weaker and growth noticeably higher. </p> <p>It is to be hoped the lesson is learned.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s economy slipped backwards in the September quarter, by a greater than expected 0.5%. It is the first time in five years the economy has recorded three months of negative growth. When the economy previously contracted in a single quarter, in March 2011 (by 0.2%), it had suffered from the Queensland flood. If it contracts again in the December quarter, Australia will be in a technical recession \u2013 ending 25 years of economic growth. Australia\u2019s annual economic growth rate has now dropped from 3.3% to just 1.8%. Economists say it is now more consistent with the softening in the labour market that has occurred since the start of the year. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, in a hastily convened media conference, said Labor must now support the government\u2019s $48bn tax cut plan because the economy needed it. \u201cThis is the ticket to the next 25 years of growth,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cBut we cannot achieve that if we cannot get the partners in this parliament that will engage with us in the national interest, that won\u2019t be engaging in party political games, that won\u2019t engage in negative politics and wrecking and destroying, but will engage to lift the burden on business so they can invest and employ more people.\u201d James Pearson, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also called for corporate tax cuts. \u201cAustralia must not be like the frog in the pot of water that is slowly brought to boil,\u201d he said. \u201cTo regain our competitiveness, and therefore create and sustain jobs, we must encourage our businesses, which employ most Australian workers, to invest and grow. That includes by cutting the burden of company tax to stimulate investment.\u201d But the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, criticised Morrison\u2019s management of the economy. \u201cThis is the second-worst economic growth result in the last 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is true that quarterly figures do bounce around, and we would hope and trust that next quarter\u2019s figures are much stronger after this very low base, but the fact of the matter is that this is a deeply concerning result.\u201d \u201cThe treasurer a few moments ago, in what I thought was a rather pathetic press conference, spent the whole time blaming the Labor party. Scott Morrison must take responsibility,\u201d he said. The Bureau of Statistics data showed economic activity contracted in a range of areas in the last quarter, highlighting the ongoing fragility of the economy. Falls in public expenditure, net exports, private investment in new buildings, new engineering, and new and used dwellings all detracted significantly from growth. Mining investment fell for the 12th consecutive quarter (down 10.6%), while non-mining investment rose by 4.8%. Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said one of the wettest winters on record caused disruptions, contributing to the unexpected decline in home building activity \u2013 including a 9% fall in new home building activity in Victoria. He said lending conditions were tightened in the second half of 2015, with housing finance contracting over the half year to March 2016, and that had negative spill-over effects. He said global growth and trade had also been lacklustre this year, while the labour market had been weaker than last year. Michael Blythe, the chief economist of the Commonwealth Bank, said growth was also affected by the election campaign in June and July, when measures of economic and political uncertainty spiked to near-record highs. \u201cThis uncertainty had a real economic impact on consumer and business activity,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIt is not surprising that some economic drivers weakened at the time. Both Blythe and Hanlan believe economic growth should pick up again in the December quarter. \u201cIn a sense it should be easier for the economy to grow from here,\u201d Blythe said. \u201cThe income drag from falling commodity prices has ended in spectacular fashion with the surge in key bulk commodity prices. The spending drag from falling mining capital expenditure will soon be complete. What lies ahead are the benefits of rising mining production and resource exports.\u201d Philip Lowe, the Reserve Bank governor, acknowledged after Tuesday\u2019s board meeting that \u201csome slowing\u201d in economic growth rate was likely, before it picked up again in the new year. The RBA left the cash rate on hold this week, at 1.5%, where it will stay until February at least when the Bank returns from its summer recess.",
