      "bodyText": "The water company Severn Trent has confirmed that it has received a bid approach that could value it at about \u00a35bn. The news drove shares in the FTSE 100 company \u2013 which supplies water and sewerage services to 4.2m businesses and households in the Midlands and mid-Wales \u2013 almost 14% higher to close at \u00a320.77. The potential takeover comes from a consortium of the state of Kuwait's investment arm, a Canadian infrastructure investor and one of the UK's largest pension funds. The company, formed in 1989 as part of the process to privatise the UK water authorities, said there was no guarantee of a firm offer from the group, comprising the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), Borealis Infrastructure Management and the Universities Superannuation Scheme. \"This approach is at a very early stage, no proposal has been made and there can be no certainty that an offer will be made or as to the terms of any such offer, should one be forthcoming,\" it said in a brief statement. The consortium faces a put-up-or-shut-up deadline of 11 June to make a firm offer. KIO is the London branch of the Kuwait Investment Authority, which manages the state's vast oil revenues. Canada's Borealis has other investments in the UK, including High Speed 1, Associated British Ports, and Scotia Gas Networks. Analysts said water companies made attractive takeover targets because of their large customer bases, guaranteed income streams, and cash generation. Howard Wheeldon, an independent analyst, said water companies were considered \"mini safe havens\". Ronnie Chopra, head of strategy at Tradenext, said the bid for Severn Trent \"highlights the value among other utilities especially United Utilities which has been touted as a bid target for many years. \"United has constantly generated very strong cash flow and is backed by one of the highest dividend yields in the FTSE 100.\" United Utilities shares rose 2.8% to 760.5p yesterday. Tina Cook, analyst at Charles Stanley, said despite the appeal of UK listed water companies to overseas investors and infrastructure funds, the timing of the approach for Severn Trent was \"surprising\". \"The timing of the potential deal is somewhat surprising in that it comes just ahead of the UK water sector's next regulatory price review 2015-20, which is currently underway and due to be finalised next year. This inevitably creates some mid-term risk across the sector,\" she said. Last month Severn Trent announced that its chief executive, Tony Wray, had told the board of his intention to step down in Spring 2014 after seven years in the role and nine at the company. The company said it was announcing his retirement to allow the necessary time to a search for his successor, as well as an \"orderly handover\". If a deal does materialise, it would make Severn Trent the latest UK water company to be bought by foreign investors. Thames Water was bought in 2006 by a consortium led by Australian investment group Macquarie for \u00a38bn. A year later the owner of Yorkshire Water, Kelda Group, was sold to a group of buyers including Citigroup, HSBC, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, and Infracapital Partners. Severn Trent was originally formed in 1974 as a regional, state-owned water authority based in Birmingham and providing services around two of Britain's largest rivers - the Severn and the Trent. Severn Trent Water operates from the Bristol Channel to the Humber and from mid-Wales to the East Midlands, while Severn Trent Services \u2013 a supplier of water and waste water treatment solutions - operates in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and Asia Pacific. Wealth of resources The Kuwait Investment Office, the London branch of Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund, has investments worth more than \u00a315bn in 100 UK listed companies and holds a stake in Gatwick airport via private equity funds. Through its property company St Martins, the Kuwaiti state invests its oil wealth in upmarket offices in the City of London and Canary Wharf. Borealis Infrastructure has interests in Associated British Ports, the UK's largest ports company with 21 ports, as well as HS1, the UK's only high-speed railway line, linking London to Brussels and Paris. The Canadian group also holds a 25% stake in Scotia Gas, which provides fuel to 5.7 million people in Scotland and the south of England. The Universities Superannuation Scheme has invested UK higher education workers' pensions in bonds in the UK's Affinity Water and South East Water, and infrastructure projects in continental Europe and Australia.",

A discussion paper written by six IMF staff members said policymakers in the UK, the US and the European Union should consider tailoring their solutions to the riskiness of individual banks rather than imposing blanket solutions. While accepting that the reforms reflected a deep sense of unease with the risk culture in evidence before the crisis of 2007, the study \u2013 a discussion paper and not official IMF policy \u2013 called for a global cost-benefit analysis that would show whether the reforms were worthwhile. The authors said: \"The structural measures to reform banks such as the US Volcker rule, the UK's Vickers ring-fence, and the EU's Liikanen proposal, which would create functional separation of businesses, all reflect a deep sense of unease with the risk culture engendered by the assumption of trading and speculative investments by deposit-taking banks.\" But they added that the proposed reforms would not have prevented the crisis at Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the event that brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse. \"Looking back, however, restrictions on proprietary trading or investments in private equity alone would not have prevented major bank failures such as Lehman Brothers. Nor would reorganising the bank into separate subsidiaries in each host and home country have facilitated its global, group-wide resolution.\" The study said Britain, the US and the EU were important financial centres and that they could bring benefits to the global economy if the structural reforms led to greater stability. \"Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that these policies will also have potentially significant global costs given that they will be imposed on internationally active and systemic financial institutions. \"Our assessment points to the need for a global cost-benefit exercise encompassing the extraterritorial implications of structural measures. This is necessary to confirm whether the benefits of structural measures match or exceed costs at a global level as it would be difficult to justify them otherwise.\" The study raised three possible objections to the reforms: the challenge of implementing them successfully; the possibility that risk would migrate to other parts of the financial system, such as \"shadow banks\"; and that there would be costs in making banks less diverse.",

      "bodyText": "The most significant detail on the first womenswear range overseen by Belinda Earl, the new style director at Marks &amp; Spencer, isn't the nod-to-Celine sorbet pink of the \u00a385 coat that will hit stores in August, or the very-Victoria-Beckham just-below-the-knee-length dresses, or the on-trend kilt-styling of a tartan skirt. In fact, it isn't visible at all, until you look at the inside of the clothes, and find that the overlocked seams usual on mass-produced clothing, and used by M&amp;S until now, have been replaced by French seams in which the raw edges have been fully enclosed. The bold fashion message on which Belinda Earl is pinning her hopes of turning around the fortunes of Britain's biggest clothing retailer is about quality, not trend. Earl's decision to pursue higher standards rather than high fashion is a big moment for M&amp;S. While rivals Next and Primark are growing their sales, M&amp;S is struggling \u2013 and its chief executive, Marc Bolland, hired three years ago with a \u00a315m golden hello, is on the ropes. M&amp;S's clothing sales have been in decline for almost two years and if these new ranges don't fly off the rails his job will be on the line. Shareholders have given him until this winter to show his turnaround plan can work. There have even been rumours that an overseas buyer, possibly from the Middle East, will move in on the business. Last night, the retailer revealed the collections to City analysts. Their reaction was just as important as that of the fashion press, which was given an early view. \"We spent months in focus groups talking to customers,\" said Earl, \"and the message was very clear. Women want quality, and they are encouraging us to reassert our leadership in bringing that to the high street. Often with focus groups you have to spend a long time unpicking the findings to work out what people are trying to say, but what was remarkable was how consistent the message was. Of course they want style, they want to look modern and relevant \u2013 we all do these days. But they still care about quality.\" Earl, the former head of Debenhams and Jaeger hired to breathe new life into the ailing M&amp;S clothing business, selects as her personal favourite from the collection an off-white single-breasted cashmere coat. At \u00a3229 it is far from cheap, but with the quality of fabric, fit and finish bearing up well in comparison with designer coats priced in five figures, it represents value for money for a customer prepared to invest. The premium Autograph range, which had shuffled confusingly close to the main collection out of fear of higher price points, will now be premium once again: \"Three-quarters of the fabrics in Autograph have been upgraded,\" says Earl. Cashmere in the main collection has been upweighted by 9% \u2013 but the price will be lowered by an average of \u00a34 an item by ordering more and selling cashmere in more stores. Bolland's future is now in Earl's hands \u2013 and those of the former head of the M&amp;S food business, John Dixon. The store's upmarket food range, unlike its fashion, has been performing well. In January, Bolland also hired a new head of lingerie \u2013 Janie Schaffer from US chain Victoria's Secret \u2013 but she quit last month after falling out with Bolland. In an industry driven by a constant desire for newness and a dizzying merry-go-round of trends, relying on relatively under-the-hood tinkering to turn around a crisis of the scale of the one facing M&amp;S \u2013 which has reported a fall in clothing sales for seven consecutive seasons and is set to unveil a second consecutive year of declining annual profits next week \u2013 is a brave move. But Earl insists the strategy \"plays to the strengths of M&amp;S. The quality of the shopping experience \u2013 from the shopfloor to how the clothes last \u2013 is what our heritage is all about. It's our DNA.\" At ground level, the way the clothes are displayed is being updated to reflect how women now shop. There will be more outfits on mannequins, showing outfit ideas, and fewer crowded racks. \"Three weeks ago we launched a 'Fashion Academy' so that the fashion messaging behind the collections is explained to the sales assistants, so that they can help customers.\" Behind the scenes, M&amp;S is trying to update its out-of-date distribution systems, which still rely on shop assistants counting clothes on the shop rails to assess stock levels. Three giant new clothing warehouses are being built so that online orders don't have to be gathered from 50 warehouses around the country before they can be sent. But the new behind-the-scenes systems won't help M&amp;S if shoppers don't like the clothes. Earl has overseen a leaner edit of catwalk trends. There are fewer pieces directly inspired by catwalk standouts, and more items designed with \"wardrobe-building\" in mind. \"Our prints had become a little garish,\" admits Frances Russell, trading director for M&amp;S womenswear, \"so we have toned them down a little this season. We are thinking in a holistic way about what the customer already has in her wardrobe \u2013 monochrome pieces from last winter, for instance \u2013 and building on those.\" Functionality and fit are as central to the notion of quality as fabric. \"High heel tights\" with a gel pad in the ball of the foot are a genuine lightbulb moment, while a \"no-peep\" white blouse with added buttons is a no-brainer. A washable silk blouse for \u00a360, from the Autograph range, is a sound investment. Success in womenswear is vital for M&amp;S, because giving women a shopping buzz has a \"halo effect\" on homewares, childrenswear, food and menswear. Earl aims not only to shore up the traditionally strong categories of trousers, knitwear and underwear but to extend reach into coats and dresses, both of which are strong in this collection. It remains to be seen whether customers deliver on their promise to prioritise quality over a fast fashion fix. But if they do \u2013 and it's a big if \u2013 this collection could be a high street gamechanger.",

Second, in a previous posting he was the well-remunerated chief executive of Anglian Water, under private equity and pension fund ownership, so he's an unlikely regulatory revolutionary.

    "webTitle": "EU agrees to protect small savers, but divided over tax evasion - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With the Ecofin meeting over, that's all from me today. Here's a closing summary. \u2022 EU finance ministers have agreed that upcoming new rules on how to resolve a failed bank should include guaranteed protection for savers with under \u20ac100,000. The decision, taken at today's Ecofin meeting, is meant to reassure European bank customers that their money is safe, following the Cypriot bailout farrago, under the upcoming bank recovery and resolution directive that will outline how failing banks are handled. See 6.09pm for the story, and 5.03pm onwards for highlights of tonight's press conference. \u2022 But there was only limited progress on other issues in Brussels. Ministers failed to reach a full agreement on how other creditors would be 'bailed in' under the new bank restructuring rules (see 12.25pm onwards for the key quotes) and the WSJ's early take is here. \u2022 Hopes that ministers would agree a new directive to clamp down on tax evasion were also dashed. Austria and Luxembourg refused to sign up for the directive, to the clear annoyance of the EU tax commissioner (see 5.16pm). Instead, the EC has agreed a mandate for fresh negotiations with the likes of Monaco and San Marino (see 4.50pm for details) \u2022 The big news of the morning was a new survey which found a sharp drop in support for the European Union across Europe. Pew said rising unhappiness and anger over the debt crisis was turning the EU into 'the sick man of Europe' (see 8.17am for full details) \u2022 Ian Traynor, our Europe editor, said the survey showed the relationship between Germany and France is deteriorating (see 11.30am) \u2022 Greece's credit rating was raised by Fitch. It which said the chances of the country leaving the eurozone had receded (see 6.02pm) \u2022 And the latest ZEW survey of economic sentiment in Germany was a disappointment. (see 10.23am onwards). Thanks, as ever, for reading and for the many excellent comments. See you in the morning... Goodnight! It was another bullish day in Europe's stock markets, with the FTSE 100 finishing up almost 1% at its highest level since October 2007 up 54 points at 6686. As my colleague Nick Fletcher points out, it's the ninth daily rise in a row, and the best run since July 2009. A takeover bid for Severn Trent (up 13% today) helped push the Footsie higher. Another factor was the sight of a bullish hedge fund manager, David Tepper, on CNBC today: David Madden, market analyst at IG, explains: David Tepper may not be the sole reason for this rally, but investors seem to have responded positively to the sight of a major hedge-fund manager making positive noises about the US economy Here's Reuters take on the EU's decision to protect small savers, but the lack of concrete agreement on other issues (as we've covered through the day). Depositors keeping less than 100,000 euros in a bank that is being closed down will get all their money back, European Union finance ministers agreed on Tuesday, and most supported the idea that bigger depositors would get privileged status. \"There was general agreement that deposits below 100,000 euros in any resolution will be sacrosanct,\" Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan, who chaired the talks, told a news conference. The ministers were discussing rules of closing down banks and the hierarchy of losses imposed on the banks' owners and creditors in such an event. EU Internal Market Commissioner Michel Barnier said that most ministers supported the view that large depositors above 100,000 euros should enjoy a privileged status, and be the last to lose any funds, after senior bondholders. The ministers are to conclude the discussions in June. Back to Fitch's decision this evening to upgrade Greece's credit rating to B- / stable. The agency said it took the move after concluding that Athens had made real progress in addressing its debt crisis: The Greek economy is rebalancing: clear progress has been made towards eliminating twin fiscal and current account deficits and 'internal devaluation' has at last begun to take hold. The price has been high in terms of lost output and rising unemployment and the capacity for recovery is still in doubt. Nonetheless, sovereign debt relief and an easing of fiscal targets have lifted Central Bank measures of economic sentiment to a three-year high and the risk of eurozone exit has receded. The full statement is online here. End of press conference... Michael Noonan was also forced to defend Ireland's tax system, including its low corporation tax rates. It's not 'aggressive' he insists, merely transparent*. Noonan adds that corporation tax levels are being lowered in other countries too, such as Britain. * - doesn't that mean we can see right through them, as Pratchett once put it?... So, small depositors are safe, but we're not hearing a lot about those with more than \u20ac100,000 in a bank that fails. That's because ministers couldn't reached a deal about creditor protection limits. And this could cause jitters in the European banking sector, if corporations, organisations and wealthier individuals fear that they are near the front of the line when the bail-in bucket comes round.... The next question points out that the original Cyprus bailout managed to impose losses on small savers by declaring a tax, rather than a bail-in. Why can't it happen again? Noonan replies that the Cyprus situation was unusual, and that everyone now realises that the levy was a very bad idea. The public reaction to what happened in Cyprus has nailed it down \"harder than ever\" that deposits under \u20ac100,000 are sacrosanct, he adds. So that's a firm commitment from the EU ministers that small savers, with up to \u20ac100,000 in the bank, will be absolutely protected in the event of a bank failure. The Q&amp;A session begins, and the press pack are chasing Noonan over his comments that 'almost everyone' in the Ecofin meeting believes guarenteeing savings below \u20ac100,000 are sacrosant. Noonan explains that some finance ministers pointed out that their juristictions have a limit below \u20ac100,000 [he doesn't say who]. But the broad agreement, he insists, is that such small savers' protection is sacrosant. Michel Barnier explains the details of today's discussions on banking resolution mechanisms: Just in: Fitch has upgraded Greece's credit rating to 'B-', with a stable outlook. EU tax commissioner Algirdas Semeta is being politely scathing about Austria and Luxembourg after they blocked the Ecofin from adopting the new tax evasion directive today. Semeta says that expectations were high going into the meeting: I cannot say that high expectations were fully met..... and he added: It saw with great disappointment that I saw a deal on the new savings directive blocked today..... Semeta does hail the new mangate on tax deals as a step forwards, but hopes that EU leaders can do better when they meet nextr week. In the battle of tax evasion, what we achieved today was undoubedly a step forward. Let's hope that what our leaders agree next week is more like a giant leap. Noonan confirms that EU ministers couldn't reach agreement on the new tax evasion directive, but points to the agreement on a new mandate on negotiations with other countries (see 4.50pm) Curious... Noonan tells the press conference that \"almost everyone\" agreed that deposits under \u20ac100k should be protected under the new bank resolution mechanisms. Who doesn't?... He adds that there was general agreement for a broad scope for a bail-in procedure with \"a limited number of exclusions\". (However, as we covered at lunchtime, no agreement on the depositor preference details) And we're off! Michael Noonan begins by saying that Ecofin made 'concrete progress' on three issues -- bank resolution mechanisms, the EU budget, and tax evasion. (remember, it's being streamed here) The European Council has issued a statement, confirming that EU ministers agreed to give the commission a mandate to negotiate amendments to the EU's agreements with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino on the taxation of savings income (tax evasion, basically) It's online here: Savings taxation: Council go-ahead to negotiate with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino. Here's a flavour: The decision represents an important step in the EU's efforts to clamp down on tax evasion and tax fraud. The aim is to ensure that the five countries continue to apply measures that are equivalent to the EU's directive on the taxation of savings income, which is being updated. The Commission will negotiate on the basis of a draft directive amending the savings directive (2003/48/EC), aimed at improving its effectiveness and closing certain loopholes so as to prevent its circumvention. You can follow the Ecofin press conference live, here. (not actually underway yet...) The Ecofin press conference is about to start. It's 20 minutes earlier than expected, too. A rarity for the EU.... The Wall Street Journal has summed up the lack of progress over bank resolution mechanisms today (as covered in the blog from 12.11pm onwards) EU Ministers Split on Protection for Depositors (paywall). Here's a flavour: German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, along with his Dutch and Danish counterparts, backed a tough approach in which uninsured depositors would contribute on the same level as senior bondholders when problems arose. While that would help limit the losses borne by other classes of creditors, some worry it could jeopardize financial stability and scare off savers. At the other end of the spectrum, France's Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said uninsured depositors should be excluded from sharing losses as a general rule, with a resolution authority able to question that in individual cases. Other ministers backed a mixed approach under which uninsured depositors would be tapped, but only after all other creditors had been bailed in. Such \"depositor preference\" is supported by the European Commission and European Central Bank, and is already status quo in countries such as the U.S. Back in Brussels the finance ministers of Luxembourg and Austria have been holding their own press conference, to explain why they didn't support the EU directive on tax evasion. Luc Frieden defended the countries' line, saying they are committed to the issue: Here's some other highlights: Oh, and it's still being streamed here RadioBubble, the Greek citizens media group, has written up yesterday's marches in support of Greek teachers who are being 'mobilised' by Greek authorities to prevent them holding strike action. Update on the teachers' strike and civil mobilization - 14 May 2013 It reports that Greek police have been distributing mobilization orders widely today, which are designed to stop teachers holding industrial action at the start of the Greek exam season. There's also a photo of a mobilization order which shows that the measure is \"open-ended\": In other words, the teachers' right to strike has been revoked until further notice. Word from Brussels that the Eurogroup meeting is almost over... Britain's permanent representative to the EU confirms that EU ministers failed to reach an agreement on the Savings tax directive, but did agree a mandate for reaching agreemetn with third-parties: Head-up: eurozone GDP data for the first three months of 2013 will be released tomorrow morning. Economists expect another quarter of contraction, extending the eurozone recession by another three months. But the decline is likely to be slower than in the last three months of 2012. My colleague Jo Moulds has the details: Eurozone recession set to ease but recovery elusive Algirdas Semeta, Commissioner for Taxation, says he is disappointed that finance ministers didn't reach agreement on the tax evasion directive today (thanks to obstruction from certain members). The issue will be considered at an EU summit next week (on May 22nd), he adds. But Germany's Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is more positive, saying it would be wrong to think there is 'frustration' at the Eurogroup today. He points out that leaders have reached \"unanimous agreement\" on a mandate for negotiations with Switzerland over tax evasion. Maria Fekter appears to be effectively blocking the EU's attempt to bring in new rules to clamp down on tax evasion. She's saying Austria can't sign up to the new Savings Directive until Europe has hammered out deals with other parts of the world for the exchange of information. However, those countries (such as Switzerland) are resisting those agreements until Europe has agreed its own tougher rules inhouse.... by approving the Directive. Fekter adds that Austria sees the Directive \"a little more positively\" than in the past.... The question today is whether finance ministers back an amended EU Savings Directive, or not. Maria Fekter, Austria's finance minister, says that the existing directive has never worked because its scope is too limited. So she is minded to back the new directive, but \"not today\" as there is insufficient harmonisation with the rest of the world. I accept the text, but not adopted today, because we then have the situation that we in Europe are going further [than other countries]. EU finance ministers are discussing the issue of tax evasion, and whether to share more information on savings accounts (a big issue for George Osborne today - see 11.18am). The Ecofin meeting is continuing, and being streamed here. No major dramas yet..... Back in Brussels, finance ministers have voted through an amended 2013 budget - despite George Osborne asking for extra savings to be made. That's via J\u00fcrgen Baetz, who is covering the Ecofin meeting for AP. Portugal has no intention selling its gold reserves to fund any future aid package, the head of the country's central bank has pledged. Bank of Portugal Governor Carlos Costa insisted today that Portugal was not falling off track with its bailout programme. Asked about the possibility of a gold sale in future, Costa replied: It is not applicable in Portugal. Portugal holds 382.5 tonnes of gold, according to recent estimates. That's worth around $19bn (\u20ac14.6bn) at current prices -- around 25 times more than Cyprus's reserves. Costa also ruled out revising his economic forecasts, even though the bank expects a 1.1% increase in GDP in 2014, while the Lisbon government only expects 0.6% growth. The economic crisis which is hitting faith in the EU (see opening post onwards) has also thumped British Land. The company announced today that the value of its European portfolio has fallen by 17%, mainly due to the biting recession in southern Europe. British Land now plans to dispose of its continental businesses. My colleague Nick Fletcher has the full story here: British Land plans European exit as economic crisis hits property values City analyst Dan Davies jokes that Eurozone finance minister haven't really grasped the point that \"depositor preference\" means the order at which creditors are bailed into a rescue: The lack of clear agreement between finance ministers has alarmed author Lawrence McDonald, who points out that Europe has had years to reach a deal: The Cyprus bailout has put the issue of bank failures in the forefront of many people's minds, especially after its government briefly planned to tax all savers. Eurogroup ministers now all insist that 'insured depositors' are safe. But those guarantees are only as strong as the government that stands behind them, as Sony Kapoor of the ReDefine thinktank points out: European commissioner Michel Barnier isn't convinced by Pierre Moscovici's suggestion that Europe should not lay out a clear \"depositor preference\" Moscovici is pushing for 'flexibility' over who picks up the bill, rather than a fixed order for which creditors suffer losses when a bank is in trouble. Barnier didn't mince his words, either, telling the room (in French) that: I have some difficulty, to be frank with you, with Pierre's proposal. (quote via the FT's Peter Spiegel) Ireland's Michael Noonan, who is chairing the meeting, summed up the meeting by claiming that finance ministers were homing in on an agreement. But the watching journalists aren't sure that's quite right: (our 12.11pm post summed up the differing views too) Now George Osborne speaks, saying that \"flexibility with restraint\" is the key to succesful, workable, rules for failing European banks. The UK chancellor says it is essential that small savers (with up to \u20ac100,000) are completely protected under rules for handling a bank that needs to be recapitalised, or wound down. Osborne points out that the decision of whether to put senior bondholders ahead of uninsured depositors, or behind them, is tricky. A \"clear creditor hierarchy\" can be evaded, he explains. Here's Osborne's thinking: If bondholders face the first hit, then corporations could get round the rules by moving money from bonds into bank deposits. But on the other hand, protecting all deposits could be controversial in a country such as Cyprus where many were held by businessmen from outside the eurozone. Should they really be protected ahead of European banks? Osborne also backed an idea mentioned by Dutch finance minister Jeroen DIjsselbloem, of a 'bailinable buffer' in case banks hit trouble. The UK, though, can't afford to set its own fund up, though, given the size of its banking sector. And before anyone suggested a new levy, Osborne added that Britain has \"the highest bank taxes of any country around this table. EU finance ministers are still at odds over how to resolve failing banks. The public session (streamed live here) has heard a range of views over bank resolution mechanisms. The debate revolves around how creditors are 'bailed in' to fund future rescue deals, and in what order of priority. J\u00f6rg Asmussen of the ECB said was \"essential\" that ministers reach agreement quickly, so that bank resolution can be introduced in 2014. we need to establish a clear pecking order for the bail-in. Sweden's Anders Borg warned that introducing rules that would 'bail-in' large creditors could be destabilising for EU countries who are not in the euro. They cannot rely on the ECB to step in, he warned. Spain's Luis De Guindos was also concerned about the implication of exposing depositors with more than \u20ac100,000 in the bank to losses. That could easily prompt a bank run, even among smaller savers, he warned: France's Pierre Moscovici called for flexibility, saying a 'discretionally approach' is best when deciding who should take the hit. But Koen Geens of Belgium argued in favour of clear rules: As did Germany and Denmark: Another day, another interest rate cut. Serbia has slashed borrowing costs by 50 basis points, from 11.75% to 11.25%. Analysts had only expected a quarter-point cut. It's the first cut in a year, and follows a stream of similar rate reductions in the past fortnight (eg the ECB, Australia, Poland, Israel...) Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, has dubbed the Pew's report into Europe \"a catalogue of unremitting gloom (unless you're a German)\" The report (see 8.17am onwards for details) is the latest sign that the Franco-German alliance at the heart of Europe is wobbling, he says. Ian writes: It is striking how the policy responses of EU leaders to the currency crisis are at such odds with public opinion, as centrifugal political action clashes with centripetal national moods. The crisis management of the past three years has essentially seen Berlin, Brussels, and others resort to technocratic fixes in an incremental process of pooling economic and fiscal policy powers in the eurozone. Outside of Germany, however, public support for surrendering such powers from the national level to Brussels, as is happening, is declining rapidly, generating an ever widening \"democratic deficit\" in the EU that the leaders regularly bemoan but have done nothing to address. Here's Ian's full analysis: Eurozone crisis sees Franco-German axis crumbling George Osborne will push fellow finance ministers at today's Ecofin to help tackle tax evasion by signing up for a new EU directive on savings. Our political editor, Patrick Wintour, explains that the directive will mean countries share more tax information, making it harder to conceal taxable assets. Osborne, in advance of a heads of EU government summit later this month devoted to tax transparency, will urge his fellow EU ministers to sign off the directive, which has been delayed by almost a decade. Writing to other EU finance ministers ahead of Tuesday's meeting, he says: \"Unless Europe can show it can agree on this existing proposal, our commitment to a new, stronger standard will not be credible. It is a test of our seriousness, and the world is watching us.\" Here's the full story: George Osborne urges EU finance ministers to sign tax directive The public section of the Ecofin meeting is being streamed here Over in Brussels, finance ministers from across the EU have gathered for today's Ecofin event. On the agenda, the push towards banking union and the details of the 2013 EU budget. Here's a few photos of the pre-meeting banter: The agenda for the meeting is online here: ECONOMIC and FINANCIAL AFFAIRS Council meeting, Brussels, 14 May 2013 In summary (all times approximate) \u2022 Banking Recovery and Resolution - from 10am BST/11am CEST \u2022 Any other business - from noon BST/1pm CEST \u2022 Draft Amending Budget No 2 to the General Budget 2013 - from 1.30pm BST/2.30pm CEST \u2022 Savings taxation (relating to how savings income is taxed, and potential tax evasion) - from 2.15pm BST/3.15pm CEST \u2022 Press conference: 5pm BST/6pm CEST The news that German investor confidence has barely improved (see 10.23am) has disappointed financial analysts. They say it shows that the eurozone recession is grinding on, while Germany itself appears to be stabilising. Here's a round-up of reaction, from the Reuters terminal: Lothar Hessler of HSBC Trinkaus We had expected a better result after industrial orders and output and exports all rose recently. Also the European Central Bank cut rates. The data nevertheless point to a stabilisation of the German economy. It is growing again. But the euro zone is still in a recessionary phase. That in turn dampens the upswing here. David Brown of New View Economics Germany and the troubled Eurozone economies are poles apart in terms of where they are in the recovery cycle and Eurozone policymakers should not confuse them. While Germany continues to pull away, the rest of the Eurozone still needs a lot more stimulus efforts from the ECB and government fiscal policies before the Euro area is off the recession rocks. Thilo Heidrich of Postbank Basically, the ZEW index remained below expectations. Above all, a strong stock exchange performance and good industrial data from Germany had led people to expect something better. On the other hand, the data points to a continued expectation among participants of economic stabilisation or a slight recovery.\" ... And Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets points out that ZEW took the shine of this morning's decent industrial production data (see 10.12am) From Pew to ZEW...and the closely watched survey of economic sentiment has shown that German analysts and investors are still alarmed by the troubles in the eurozone. The ZEW index inched higher to 36.4, from 36.3, dashing forecasts of a larger rise on the back of recent decent data. A separate measure of current conditions dropped to 8.9 this month from 9.2 in April - suggesting the German economy is struggling to bounce back from its contraction at the end of 2012. Clemens Fuest, president of the ZEW Institute, commented: Despite mostly positive economic data for the German economy, the ZEW indicator remains at the level of the previous month. This may be due to the still poor economic situation in the euro zone, that is also reflected by the recent ECB interest rate cut Reaction to follow.... Eurozone industrial output rose by 1% month-on-month in March, according to Eurostat. That's twice as bit a rise as analysts had forecast, and an encouraging sign for Europe's manufacturing base (although the increase was mainly due to strong energy demand). February's reading was revised down from 0.4% to 0.3%, so the sector is still 1.7% smaller than a year ago. Italy's government debt has risen to a new alltime high of \u20ac2.035 trillion in March - the Bank of Italy reported. Pew's findings also chime with the latest Guardian/ICM poll, released this morning, which showed a surge in support for the eurosceptic Ukip party. The poll found that the number of voters backing Ukip has doubled to 18%, while the three main parties all lost four percentage points. Ths rising anti-European sentiment, both in the country and on its own backbenches, has forced the UK government to announce plans for a new draft bill introducing an in-out EU referendum. Here's the full story: David Cameron offers olive branch on EU referendum as Ukip soars Quick bit of housekeeping. Here's what's coming up in the eurozone \u2022 Ecofin finance ministers meeting in Brussels begins: 10am BST/11am CEST \u2022 Ecofin press conference: 5pm BST/6pm CEST (estimated!) \u2022 Spanish debt auction: morning \u2022 German ZEW survey of economic sentiment: 10am BST \u2022 ECB's J\u00f6rg Asmussen speaking in Berlin: 5pm BST. (via RanSquawk) The 'national stereotypes' section of Pew's report gives an interesting insight into European attitudes: Asked which EU member was 'most compassionate', people in each country surveyed picked themselves. The French identified themselves as both the 'most arrogant' and 'least arrogant', while everyone decided that Germany was the most trustworthy, apart from the Greeks who felt they deserved the crown: (that's from the bottom of this page) Pew was particularly concerned about France, describing the eurozone's second-largest economy as \"Dyspeptic\", and drifting away from Germany. No European country is becoming more dispirited and disillusioned faster than France. In just the past year, the public mood has soured dramatically across the board. Economic woes are the main cause, with 91% of the French saying their economy is doing badly - up from 81% a year ago. And two-thirds of those surveyed reckon president Francois Hollande is doing a poor job handling the challenges posed by the economic crisis. That's 24 percentage points worse that his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. Worryingly for Brussels, 77% said believed European economic integration has made things worse for France (+14), and 58% now have a bad impression of the European Union as an institution (+18). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the global economy. Public support for the European project has fallen and distrust between countries is growing, according to a new survey released overnight that shows the damage caused by the region's debt crisis over the last few years. The well-respected Washington-based Pew Research Center warned that support for the EU has slid over the last 12 months, from 60% in 2012 to just 45% this year. In a report titled \"The New Sick Man of Europe: the European Union\", Pew showed that backing for European integration tumbling in France. The people of Europe are increasingly gloomy about economic conditions, disillusioned about their leaders, and losing faith in the whole idea of European Unity, the poll found. As Pew put it: The effort over the past half century to create a more united Europe is now the principal casualty of the euro crisis. The European project now stands in disrepute across much of Europe.... The prolonged economic crisis has created centrifugal forces that are pulling European public opinion apart, separating the French from the Germans and the Germans from everyone else. The southern nations of Spain, Italy and Greece are becoming ever more estranged as evidenced by their frustration with Brussels, Berlin and the perceived unfairness of the economic system. Pew surveyed over 7,600 people in March in eight countries - Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, Greece and the Czech Republic. It also found that Angela Merkel remains the most popular leader in Europe, by a wide margin. Not just at home -- Merkel won majority approval for her handling of the European economic crisis in five of the eight nations surveyed. Other leaders, though, are in the doghouse, Pew says: Compounding their doubts about the Brussels-based European Union, Europeans are losing faith in the capacity of their own national leaders to cope with the economy\u2019s woes. In most countries surveyed, fewer people today than a year ago think their national executive is doing a good job dealing with the euro crisis. The full report is here. Pew's report comes as European finance ministers gather in Brussels today to discuss how to implement banking union across the eurozone. Perhaps they'lll find time to chat about these findings in the corridors... I'll be tracking all the developments through the day, including more highlights of the Pew survey, and reaction to its findings.",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares enjoyed their best run for nearly four years after a ninth day of rises.</p> <p>Markets have been supported recently by central bank action to boost the global economy, but the extra ingredient on Tuesday was a wave of bid talk and some positive company updates.</p> <p><strong>Severn Trent </strong>soared 252p to \u00a320.77 after it confirmed it had received an approach from a consortium including Borealis Infrastructure and the Kuwait Investment Office. Earlier reports in Financial News suggested the bidders - who also include the Universities Superannuation Scheme - would be prepared to pay between \u00a322.50 and \u00a323 a share.</p> <p>Water companies have been tipped as bid targets for some time, not least for infrastructure funds, because of their steady income stream and the stable regulatory environment. But Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital warned:</p> <blockquote> A bid at this stage of the regulatory cycle (we are in year three of the five years) would carry a lot of risk for the bidder. <br> </blockquote> <p>Still, the news also sent other water groups higher, with <strong>United Utilities</strong> up 21p to 760.5p and <strong>Pennon</strong> putting on 29.5p to 695p. Ronnie Chopra, head of strategy at Tradenext said:</p> <blockquote> The bid for Severn Trent this morning highlights the value among other utilities especially United Utilities, which has been touted as a bid target for many years. United has...also reportedly hired investment bank Goldman Sachs to help it defend itself against takeover bids worth as much as \u00a37bn from a consortium backed by Middle Eastern cash. <br> Tradenext believes that a take\u2013out price would be in excess of 900p, a 20% plus premium to the current share price. </blockquote> <p>Helped by the bid news, the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>finished 54.30 points higher at 6686.06 after a downbeat start, hitting a five and a half year high - again.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares enjoyed their best run for nearly four years after a ninth day of rises. Markets have been supported recently by central bank action to boost the global economy, but the extra ingredient on Tuesday was a wave of bid talk and some positive company updates. Severn Trent soared 252p to \u00a320.77 after it confirmed it had received an approach from a consortium including Borealis Infrastructure and the Kuwait Investment Office. Earlier reports in Financial News suggested the bidders - who also include the Universities Superannuation Scheme - would be prepared to pay between \u00a322.50 and \u00a323 a share. Water companies have been tipped as bid targets for some time, not least for infrastructure funds, because of their steady income stream and the stable regulatory environment. But Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital warned: A bid at this stage of the regulatory cycle (we are in year three of the five years) would carry a lot of risk for the bidder. Still, the news also sent other water groups higher, with United Utilities up 21p to 760.5p and Pennon putting on 29.5p to 695p. Ronnie Chopra, head of strategy at Tradenext said: The bid for Severn Trent this morning highlights the value among other utilities especially United Utilities, which has been touted as a bid target for many years. United has...also reportedly hired investment bank Goldman Sachs to help it defend itself against takeover bids worth as much as \u00a37bn from a consortium backed by Middle Eastern cash. Tradenext believes that a take\u2013out price would be in excess of 900p, a 20% plus premium to the current share price. Helped by the bid news, the FTSE 100 finished 54.30 points higher at 6686.06 after a downbeat start, hitting a five and a half year high - again. The nine day run is the best performance since July 2009. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, said: European markets recovered later in the afternoon as US stock indices advanced thanks to comments by high profile US fund manager David Tepper saying he is bullish on equities on CNBC TV. His comments went someway to allay some of the fears triggered by the talk and reports that the US Federal Reserve may look to unwind stimulus measures soon. So, today's afternoon reversal clearly suggests markets are getting comfortable with the view that although Fed stimulus measures will have to come an end at some point, with a backdrop of a recovering US economy, perhaps withdrawal from the stimulus pills won't be as crippling as some had previously though. On a busy day for company updates, Babcock International pleased the market with a 16% rise in full year profits, lifted by success in defence outsourcing, and its shares climbed 74p to \u00a311.63. Gases group BG was 41.5p better at \u00a312.27 after its strategy update, where it said it would focus more on profitability having been forced to cut output targets, partly through asset sales and partly through bringing in partners to increase output more quickly. But Capita, up on Monday, slipped 4.5p to 938p as the outsourcing group reported a 20% fall in the value of contracts won in the first four months to April. But it said it was still confident of strong growth for the year.

Lonmin ended 20.9p lower at 265.1p while Anglo American was down 27p at \u00a315.50. Evraz, the steelmaker controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, fell 5.9p to 163.5p after its coal company associate Raspadskaya said it had suspended work at its main mine due to elevated gas levels. International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, continued its decline of the past few days as it issued a \u20ac400m convertible bond, down 0.4p at 270.3p. The funds will be used to pay off loans associated with its $123.5m purchase of 45% of Barcelona-based low cost carrier Vueling, giving it majority control.

However, the ONS noted the \"UK labour market has been more resilient than in previous recessions\" in that employment did not fall as far and unemployment did not rise as much. With the unemployment rate at 8% in 2011, the UK was more than halfway down the labour market league table. It ranked 21 out of 34 countries. That ranking was down 12 places from 2005. Norway was top of the league with unemployment at just 3% and Spain was bottom at 21.6%. The UK had one of the biggest drops over the six years although the US suffered similarly, down 13 places to 25th. The ONS put the shakeup in the labour market rankings down to the nature of the recession. \"Many of the countries that have overtaken the UK and US in the rankings are smaller economies, less exposed to the 2008 downturn, which centred on the US and Europe. The fall of 12 places in the international rankings for the UK has therefore come despite historically the most stable labour market seen in a UK recession,\" it said.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to grim reading about the current European condition, it does not rain but it pours. The latest catalogue of unremitting gloom (unless you're a German) comes in a 49-page survey of public opinion in eight EU countries conducted in March by Pew pollsters. The results show support for the EU has shrunk from 60% to 45% in a year on average across the eight countries. The more detailed findings are that public support for EU integration has eroded strongly, with Germans alone in favour of handing more powers to Brussels to tackle the four-year economic and financial crisis that is severely sapping EU confidence and reinforcing the sense of inexorable medium-term decline. \"Positive views of the EU are at or near their low point in most of the countries surveyed, even among the young,\" said the pollsters, who talked to nearly 8,000 people. It is striking how the policy responses of EU leaders to the currency crisis are at such odds with public opinion, as centripetal political action clashes with centrifugal national moods. The crisis management of the past three years has essentially seen Berlin, Brussels, and others resort to technocratic fixes in an incremental process of pooling economic and fiscal policy powers in the eurozone. Outside of Germany, however, public support for surrendering such powers from the national level to Brussels, as is happening, is declining rapidly, generating an ever widening \"democratic deficit\" in the EU that the leaders regularly bemoan but have done nothing to address. In a big speech on Europe last month, the leading German political thinker, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, diagnosed the elite policy responses to the crisis and concluded that \"postponing democracy is always dangerous\". Pew's findings dovetail with Eurobarometer poll results revealed last month in the Guardian that showed a collapse in public support for the EU in the union's six biggest countries, making up two-thirds of the half-billion population. The survey results are particularly spectacular for France, reinforcing the sense of drift a year into the term of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and underlining the estrangement between Paris and Berlin. \"The prolonged economic crisis is separating the French from the Germans \u2013 threatening the Franco-German axis that has long driven European integration. And it has separated the Germans from everyone else. \"No European country is becoming more dispirited and disillusioned faster than France.

This acute divergence in perception on how the crisis has affected Europe, say officials and diplomats closely involved in the crisis management, makes things much more difficult to fix because the cultural and psychological realities in the different countries are so varied. \"Overall, the 2013 survey highlights more starkly than ever the differences between the views of Germans and other Europeans on a range of issues.\"",

    "webTitle": "Europeans disillusioned and divided by debt crisis, survey finds", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Public support for the European project has plunged as the continent descends into mutual distrust, according to a new survey that shows the damage caused by the region's debt crisis over the last few years. The respected Washington-based Pew Research Centre warned that support for the EU has slid from 60% to just 45% over the past 12 months. In a report titled The New Sick Man of Europe: the European Union, Pew showed backing for European integration tumbling heavily in France. Europeans are increasingly gloomy about economic conditions, disillusioned about their leaders, and losing faith in the whole idea of European unity, the poll found. \"Positive views of the EU are at or near their low point in most of the countries surveyed, even among the young,\" said the pollsters, who talked to nearly 8,000 people in eight countries \u2013 Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Poland, Greece and the Czech Republic. The Germans alone are in favour of handing more powers to Brussels to tackle the four-year economic and financial crisis that is severely sapping EU confidence. Pew said: \"The effort over the past half century to create a more united Europe is now the principal casualty of the euro crisis. The European project now stands in disrepute across much of Europe. \"The prolonged economic crisis has created centrifugal forces that are pulling European public opinion apart, separating the French from the Germans and the Germans from everyone else. \"The southern nations of Spain, Italy and Greece are becoming ever more estranged as evidenced by their frustration with Brussels, Berlin and the perceived unfairness of the economic system.\" Pretty much the only optimism evident in the survey is in Germany, leading the pollsters to conclude that the Germans are living \"on a different continent\". The survey found that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, remains by a wide margin Europe's most popular leader, not only at home but also abroad, winning approval for her handling of the economic crisis in five of the eight nations surveyed. Other leaders, though, are in the doghouse, Pew said: \"Compounding their doubts about the Brussels-based European Union, Europeans are losing faith in the capacity of their own national leaders to cope with the economy's woes. \"In most countries surveyed, fewer people today than a year ago think their national executive is doing a good job dealing with the euro crisis.\" Pew's findings dovetail with Eurobarometer poll results revealed last month in the Guardian that showed a collapse in public support for the EU in the union's six biggest countries, making up two-thirds of the half-billion population. The survey results are particularly spectacular for France, reinforcing the sense of drift a year into the presidential term of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and underlining the estrangement between Paris and Berlin. Dyspeptic France It found the French are increasingly disillusioned, with 91% saying their economy is doing badly \u2013 up from 81% a year ago. Pew described the eurozone's second-largest economy as \"dyspeptic\", warning it is drifting away from Germany. \"The prolonged economic crisis is separating the French from the Germans \u2013 threatening the Franco-German axis that has long driven European integration. And it has separated the Germans from everyone else. \"No European country is becoming more dispirited and disillusioned faster than France. In just the past year, the public mood has soured dramatically across the board,\" Pew said. Two-thirds of those surveyed reckon president Francois Hollande is doing a poor job handling the challenges posed by the economic crisis: 24 percentage points worse that his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. Worryingly for Brussels, 77% believed European economic integration has made things worse for France (a rise of 14 percentage points), and 58% now have a bad impression of the European Union as an institution (+18). National stereotypes The survey also polled people's views on their fellow European nations. This revealed that Europeans feel that their nation is the \"most compassionate\", while many chose Germany as the \"least compassionate\" \u2013 apart from the Germans and the French, who both named the British. In a display of Gallic insouciance, the French identified themselves as both the most arrogant and least arrogant. Germany was identified as the most trustworthy country by seven nations, apart from the Greeks, who chose Greece.",

The Germans alone are in favour of handing more powers to Brussels to tackle the four-year economic and financial crisis that is severely sapping EU confidence. Pew said: \"The effort over the past half century to create a more united Europe is now the principal casualty of the euro crisis. The European project now stands in disrepute across much of Europe.</p> <p>\"The prolonged economic crisis has created centrifugal forces that are pulling European public opinion apart, separating the French from the Germans and the Germans from everyone else.</p> <p>\"The southern nations of Spain, Italy and Greece are becoming ever more estranged as evidenced by their frustration with Brussels, Berlin and the perceived unfairness of the economic system.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-408835073\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/14/1368515969447/pew3topline.png\" alt=\"Pew findings\" width=\"422\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pew findings</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pretty much the only optimism evident in the survey is in Germany, leading the pollsters to conclude that the Germans are living \"on a different continent\".</p> <p>The survey found that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, remains by a wide margin Europe's most popular leader, not only at home but also abroad, winning approval for her handling of the economic crisis in five of the eight nations surveyed.</p> <p>Other leaders, though, are in the doghouse, Pew said: \"Compounding their doubts about the Brussels-based European Union, Europeans are losing faith in the capacity of their own national leaders to cope with the economy's woes.</p> <p>\"In most countries surveyed, fewer people today than a year ago think their national executive is doing a good job dealing with the euro crisis.\"</p> <p>Pew's findings dovetail with Eurobarometer poll results revealed last month in the Guardian that showed a collapse in public support for the EU in the union's six biggest countries, making up two-thirds of the half-billion population.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/may/14/eurozone-crisis-finance-ministers-banking-union\" title=\"\">The survey results are particularly spectacular for France</a>, reinforcing the sense of drift a year into the presidential term of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and underlining the estrangement between Paris and Berlin.</p> <h2>Dyspeptic France</h2> <p>It found the French are increasingly disillusioned, with 91% saying their economy is doing badly \u2013 up from 81% a year ago.

      "bodyText": "Sony, the Japanese electronics and entertainment giant, is facing an audacious breakup attempt in a battle that could rock the staid Japanese corporate world. The US hedge fund billionaire Daniel Loeb has amassed a 6.5% stake in the $18.5bn (\u00a311bn) group and is calling for it to be broken up. Renowned for stirring up huge fights with US companies, Loeb wants Sony to spin off part of its entertainment arm, which owns one of Hollywood's largest film studios, behind the latest James Bond movie, Skyfall, and one of the biggest music labels in the world, behind artists such as Taylor Swift. But Sony said on Tuesday morning that its entertainment businesses were \"not for sale\". The New York Times reported that Loeb, who founded the hedge fund Third Point, flew to Tokyo last weekend for three days of meetings with government officials, regulators and senior Sony executives, citing people briefed on the matter. He is said to have hand-delivered a letter to the Sony chief executive, Kazuo Hirai, on Tuesday that praises a turnaround effort but asks for more. Loeb said that Third Point would put up \u00a5150bn-\u00a5200bn (\u00a3978m-\u00a31.3bn) to support an IPO of the group's entertainment operations. The hedge fund recommends that Sony then sell a 15%-20% stake in that business in an offering to existing shareholders. Separately, it proposed that the company should consider selling off its 60% stake in Sony Financial, which sells life insurance policies and has real estate holdings. That would leave the core electronics arm, which includes Sony's TV and PlayStation units. Loeb said that would generate funds to invest in the electronics business and allow the company to reduce its debt pile. Third Point thinks this strategy could drive Sony's share price up by as much as 60%, \"if implemented properly\". Sony's share price has plunged by nearly 85% over the past 13 years, as it has been overtaken in electronics by the likes of Apple, Samsung and LG. The approach represents a bet by Loeb that Japan can recover after a decade of minimal growth. Loeb has come out in support of the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is pushing policies to attract private investment. In his letter to Sony, Loeb wrote: \"Under Prime Minister Abe's leadership, Japan can regain its position as one of the world's pre-eminent economic powerhouses and manufacturing engines.\" In one of his most famous corporate spats, Loeb successfully ousted Yahoo's former chief executive and poached Marissa Mayer from Google to run the internet company.",

      "bodyText": "Three out of four whistleblowers who raise concerns of wrongdoing at work with their managers have their claims ignored, an analysis of cases has found. Files of 1,000 workers who approached a whistleblowing helpline for advice also showed that 15% were eventually sacked from their jobs while many others were bullied, ostracised or victimised. Cathy James, chief executive of the charity Public Concern at Work which runs the helpline, said that the findings show that the legislation meant to protect whistleblowing in Britain needs to be reviewed. \"Ministers and employers say it is vital for an open and transparent workplace culture, but ask the whistleblowers and the story is starkly different: they are gagged in the NHS, arrested in our police forces and blacklisted in many industries. \"The findings demonstrate why speaking up in the workplace may seem futile or dangerous to many individuals.

The researchers found that the typical whistleblower who approached the helpline was a skilled worker or professional who has been employed for less than two years. A third of the whistleblowers surveyed were from the health and social care sectors, while others worked in charities, local government and financial services. Nearly three quarters of those approaching the helpline claimed that the wrongdoing harmed customers or patients outside the workforce. The analysis found that 74% of whistleblowers who called the helpline said that after having complained to their line manager about a serious concern, nothing had been done as a result of their complaint. Nearly one in every six employees - 15% - who had approached the charity were eventually dismissed from their jobs, the analysis found. Seth Freedman, who passed his concerns to the Guardian that the wholesale gas market worth \u00a3300bn had been manipulated by traders, said little was done by his line managers at ICIS Heren when after he had first complained to them. He worked as a reporter at the firm, whose reports are the basis for the price at which gas is bought and sold, and claims he told managers they were publishing prices that had been distorted by traders.

A spokesman for ICIS Heren declined to comment. Whistleblowing legislation is currently being reviewed and a government consultation held to investigate whether the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 is failing to protect those who speak out from being victimised, harassed and even sacked by their employers. The employment relations minister Jo Swinson has put forward amendments to the legislation, followed by \"a call for evidence\" by the government to examine whether the act is, as campaigners claim, not \"fit for purpose\". Critics have claimed that the proposed amendments will still leave workers exposed and that changes to legal aid will make it much more expensive for whistleblowers to take their cases through to tribunals or courts.",
