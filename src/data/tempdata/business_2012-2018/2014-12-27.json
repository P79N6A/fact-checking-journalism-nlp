      "bodyText": "The Office of Rail Regulation will launch an investigation into serious travel disruption caused by overrunning engineering works in London, which led to services to and from two major stations being cancelled and chaotic overcrowding at a local station to which some trains were re-routed. King\u2019s Cross station remained closed on Saturday after Network Rail failed to complete maintenance work on the east coast mainline. Travellers were told to use Finsbury Park instead but the north London station was closed temporarily on Saturday morning due to overcrowding. Hundreds of passengers endured waits of more than two hours to enter or leave the platforms after the station reopened. \u201cNetwork Rail, working with the rest of the industry, must learn lessons and prevent problems like this happening again,\u201d the railway watchdog said. \u201cWe will also be reviewing the standard of passenger information with a focus on whether passengers have been adequately informed to make alternative arrangements to their journeys, or to claim compensation.\u201d Robin Gisby, the managing director of Network Rail, apologised. \u201cWe have let a lot of people down,\u201d he said and blamed the delays to the engineering works at King\u2019s Cross on equipment breakdown. He added: \u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry for the delays, upset and upheaval caused today to passengers impacted by our overrunning improvement work outside King\u2019s Cross. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an army of 11,000 engineers out over Christmas Day and Boxing Day at 2,000 locations nationwide. Over 90% has been completed and handed back to-time but I realise this is no consolation for the thousands affected today.\u201d He said Network Rail will pay compensation to train operators but would not be drawn on whether affected customers will be in line for payouts. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, described the disruption as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. \u201cPassengers must be able to trust that vital engineering works on the rail network will be completed on time,\u201d he said. \u201cPassengers deserve no less.\u201d \u201cI will be asking Network Rail to set out what went wrong and how it can learn lessons, but its priority must be to get services running into King\u2019s Cross as well as Paddington,\u201d he added. Ch Supt Paul Brogden, of the British transport police, said the queue to enter Finsbury Park after it had reopened was about an hour long, with a similar wait for passengers on trains to arrive and disembark. One traveller said they had been waiting outside Finsbury Park for two hours. \u201cInto hour 5 and we\u2019ve been stuck outside Finsbury for 2 and it\u2019s bloody freezing in carriage E!,\u201d Kidneychops tweeted. Brogden added that \u201ctemporary control measures\u201d had been implemented \u2013 meaning people were prevented for a time from entering the station to ease congestion. Travellers at Finsbury Park vented their frustration on Twitter. Jim Ewing tweeted a picture of the station concourse jammed with travellers, adding that he had been stuck in a corridor for more than an hour. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy here, disorganised chaos,\u201d he wrote. Willard Foxton tweeted a photo of the chaos outside, adding: \u201cQueue to get into Finsbury Park. Whatever genius had the plan \u2018send all of Kings X here\u2019 should be fired.\u201d George Hallam, a semi-retired economics lecturer from Lewisham, was among the crowds waiting to get on a train at Finsbury Park. He said: \u201cThere are a lot of vulnerable people here. My mother-in-law is 94, we managed to get her into a taxi some time ago. But the train companies ought to be arranging coaches, not taxis.\u201d Travellers trying to get to and from the west of England also suffered serious disruption to their journeys after all lines out of Paddington were blocked by a signalling fault, Network Rail said. Once on the trains, the misery continued, with passengers tweeting pictures of packed carriages with people standing crowded together in aisles. Lindesay Irvine, 45, a Guardian journalist, said he has been stuck on a \u201cdangerously overcrowded\u201d train after two trainloads of people, one from Bristol and one from Cornwall, were merged into one. Irvine, who was travelling to Paddington after spending Christmas with family in Bristol, said: \u201cIt is dangerously overcrowded. In health and safety terms this must be well against the law. There is not an inch of room. At the last station people tried to get on but couldn\u2019t. One person has been taken ill on the train.\u201d First Great Western said overrunning engineering works, with no trains running between London Paddington and Reading, were further exacerbating the problem. The train operator advised passengers to use alternative routes with South West Trains and Chiltern Trains and has offered refunds to travellers who decide not to travel on Saturday. West coast mainline services are also not running between London Euston and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire until 29 December, due to engineering works. Gisby told the BBC on Saturday that Network Rail hoped to have King\u2019s Cross up and running by Sunday morning. He also warned that engineering works would continue across the rail network throughout the rest of the holiday period. \u201cThis is part of a major programme,\u201d he said. \u201cWe bitterly regret what happened this morning at both Paddington and King\u2019s Cross. There\u2019s a lot of other work throughout the country that we are monitoring very carefully and we\u2019ll do all we can not to repeat the dreadful disruption that we\u2019ve caused today.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Michael Dugher, said passengers had endured \u201cmisery on top of misery\u201d . \u201cMinisters are responsible for piling misery on top of misery for those who have to rely on our railway,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the government that allowed almost the entire rail network to be shut down during Boxing Day, one of the busiest bank holidays of the year. \u201cNow we see this further unacceptable disruption, just as people try to get home after Christmas and at a time when many of our roads have experienced severe problems because of the bad weather.\u201d King\u2019s Cross was closed on Friday evening for 24 hours as work to install new overhead power cables on tracks running north of the station took longer than expected. Before Christmas, Network Rail warned passengers that a \u00a3200m engineering project scheduled between Christmas and New Year would affect stations across the network, with an estimated 11,000 engineers working on Christmas Day. Paul Emberley, a spokesman for East Coast Trains, said: \u201cNetwork Rail has apologised to passengers for the inevitable delays to their travel plans on Saturday as a result of the overrunning engineering works. \u201cEast Coast is particularly sorry, too, for the inconvenience to its customers as a result on what we know is an already very busy travel day immediately following the Christmas break. \u201cFor customers intending to start or finish their journey at King\u2019s Cross, consideration should be given to deferring travel plans to either Sunday or Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard over the holiday period to make the necessary adjustments to our timetable as a consequence, and to provide as much information as we can.\u201d A Department for Transport spokesman said: \u201cIt is extremely disappointing that Network Rail\u2019s engineering works have overrun and will affect travellers during this festive season, passengers will be rightly annoyed. \u201cThis was essential work but passengers need to be able to plan and rely on Network Rail meeting its deadlines for having the network back in service. \u201cThe department is in contact with Network Rail to understand what went wrong and if lessons can be learned for the future.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.toms.com/blakes-bio\">Blake Mycoskie</a> never imagined that one day he would be doing business with the likes of Anna Wintour, but that\u2019s exactly what happened when he foundedToms shoes - the original \u2018One for One\u2019 social company - in 2006. </p> <p>Five years after he lost his shot at winning $1m in the first season of <em>The Amazing Race, </em>Mycoskie returned to Argentina to explore the country - and Malbec. Few days into his trip, he found himself joining in on a shoe drive, collecting shoes in a better-off areas and then driving them to places outside the city to be distributed to the poor. </p> <p>\u201cWhen we started pulling out the shoes, you\u2019d have thought it was Christmas day,\u201d said Mycoskie, during a presentation at <a href=\"http://wbf.wobi.com/\">World of Business Ideas</a> Innovation Forum. \u201cThese kids were so excited to get these shoes and they weren\u2019t even new. They weren\u2019t even in the package.\u201d</p> <p>Mycoskie was excited, too. Until he realized that come next year, the 250 children they had outfitted with shoes would need a new pair again. Taking few extra weeks in Argentina, he came up with a plan: he had a local shoe maker make about 250 pairs of shoes, he would sell them back in California and then use the money to get another 250 pairs to give the kids.</p> <p>Simple, right? </p> <p>That\u2019s until the Toms shoes, as he called them, actually took off - all thanks to <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/20/entertainment/et-stylenotebook20\">a write up in the Los Angeles Times by Booth Moore</a>, a fashion writer who spotted the shoes and a photo of Mycoskie and the children in a local shoe store. <br></p> <p>After being rejected by a couple of places, the store agreed to sell about 80 pairs of Toms shoes. Mycoskie had sold another 30 to friends and relatives, through a website he had created, with one or two orders coming in each week. The day the article came out, Toms received orders for 2,200 pairs of shoes by 2 o\u2019clock that afternoon.</p> <p>\u201cBut I only had 140 pairs in my apartment.

      "bodyText": "Blake Mycoskie never imagined that one day he would be doing business with the likes of Anna Wintour, but that\u2019s exactly what happened when he foundedToms shoes - the original \u2018One for One\u2019 social company - in 2006. Five years after he lost his shot at winning $1m in the first season of The Amazing Race, Mycoskie returned to Argentina to explore the country - and Malbec. Few days into his trip, he found himself joining in on a shoe drive, collecting shoes in a better-off areas and then driving them to places outside the city to be distributed to the poor. \u201cWhen we started pulling out the shoes, you\u2019d have thought it was Christmas day,\u201d said Mycoskie, during a presentation at World of Business Ideas Innovation Forum. \u201cThese kids were so excited to get these shoes and they weren\u2019t even new. They weren\u2019t even in the package.\u201d Mycoskie was excited, too. Until he realized that come next year, the 250 children they had outfitted with shoes would need a new pair again. Taking few extra weeks in Argentina, he came up with a plan: he had a local shoe maker make about 250 pairs of shoes, he would sell them back in California and then use the money to get another 250 pairs to give the kids. Simple, right? That\u2019s until the Toms shoes, as he called them, actually took off - all thanks to a write up in the Los Angeles Times by Booth Moore, a fashion writer who spotted the shoes and a photo of Mycoskie and the children in a local shoe store. After being rejected by a couple of places, the store agreed to sell about 80 pairs of Toms shoes. Mycoskie had sold another 30 to friends and relatives, through a website he had created, with one or two orders coming in each week. The day the article came out, Toms received orders for 2,200 pairs of shoes by 2 o\u2019clock that afternoon. \u201cBut I only had 140 pairs in my apartment. This was the first of my many supply chain problems to come,\u201d says Mycoskie. \u201cI did what I think a lot of entrepreneurs do in a time of dire need - I started posting as many ads for interns on craigslist as possible. And that strategy worked.\u201d Within a week, he had three interns contacting all the people who placed their and whose cards were already charged, to let them know that they were working on filling their orders. At the same time, Mycoskie was on a plane to Argentina to figure out how to make more shoes. The new supply chain, consisting of six to seven guys making about 800 to 900 shoes a week, worked-- that is, until Anna Wintour\u2019s office called. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve just seen what this woman\u2019s character did to Anne Hathaway\u2019s character,\u201d says Mycoskie, who had just seen Devil Wears Prada that week. \u201cAnd I am thinking: I am a guy from Texas who knows nothing about fashion. This is not going to end well.\u201d The interview ended up going well - too well. \u201cVogue Magazine [made] it look like I know exactly what I am doing,\u201d he says of the article. \u201cThis does not look like a guy who is selling shoes out of his apartment with interns and they are making them in garages all throughout Buenos Aires and because it was Vogue magazine - all of a sudden everyone through we were a real company.\u201d That year Toms ended up selling 10,000 shoes out of Mycoskie\u2019s apartment. Since then Toms\u2019 \u2018One for One\u2019 has grown beyond shoes to eyewear and coffee. One bag of Toms coffee is equivalent to one week of clean water and one pair of Toms glasses is equivalent to a gift of sight for a person in need. We didn\u2019t want to stop with shoes. One for one can help many people in many ways. We caught up with Mycoskie to talk about what drives him and what advice he could impart to others looking to become social entrepreneurs. You did shoes, now you are doing eyewear and coffee. Some people would just call it a day and say, \u2018I have done my part!\u2019 [LAUGHS] \u2018No more!\u2019 Yet you keep going. What drives you?
