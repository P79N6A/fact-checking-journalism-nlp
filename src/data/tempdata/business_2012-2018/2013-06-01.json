However, tomorrow we should get some kind of update on the takeover approach made by the company's oligarch founders and the Kazakh government: the consortium will have to either stick or twist with its indicative \u00a33bn offer, or ask regulators for an extension. Those hired to speak for ENRC's independent committee assessing the approach insist it is doing everything possible to extract a higher bid for minority shareholders (although they are too shy to explain exactly what those efforts entail). Meanwhile, those close to FTSE 250 miner Kazakhmys, which owns 26% of ENRC, insist that reports it has already fallen in behind its compatriots are premature. The trouble is, many have heard such platitudes before and the market seems disinclined to believe them. ENRC shares, once worth \u00a314.59 each, stand at 239.9p, 5% below the 260p-a-share offer. The City may be wrong, but it seems to be betting on a deadline extension and then for minority shareholders to get stuffed. Again. King heads for the pavilion Sir Mervyn King, the soon-to-be-former governor of the Bank of England, is a man who loves a sporting metaphor. So as the Bank's monetary policy committee reveals the decision from its June deliberations over interest rates and quantitative easing this week, which is King's last meeting, it is tempting to consider the spectacle as akin to the fifth Test from pretty much any England versus West Indies cricket series in the 1980s. We've all got to sit through it, and there may even be the odd enjoyable contribution, but it is totally meaningless in terms of the overall result. Firstly, it would seem odd for a radical change of tactics just before Mark Carney, Threadneedle Street's new Canadian skipper, strides to the crease next month. Second, in the absence of any negative economic news since May's gathering, economists reckon the discussion will mirror recent months. That debate has seen King outvoted on the past four occasions about introducing more QE to stimulate the UK economy, so this week's meeting provides his team with a final chance to ignore him. And for King to play and miss one more time. And so does Buckles Here is Nick Buckles, the former boss of accident-prone security group G4S, speaking about his aborted takeover tilt at rival ISS following the company's humbling annual general meeting last year: \"[Shareholders] didn't like the deal \u2026 These things take a little bit of time to heal. We're 70%-80% of the way there.\" As was common with Buckles, the confidence merely pre-empted farce. A month later the healing process was reversed, as G4S messed up the Olympic Games contract and the armed forces were mobilised at short notice to come to the rescue. A profit warning earlier this year made it a hat-trick, and Buckles inevitably left the group on Friday. The company now hopes his departure will allow the slapstick to be considered part of history, as the board faces shareholders once again this week to present its (very) fresh line-up. The new chief exec, Ashley Almanza, has been with the group for just a month, while incoming chief operating officer Eddie Aston has yet to arrive. That makes it appear as though new(ish) chairman John Connolly has been forced into a brutal conclusion: when it comes to healing shareholder wounds, people with zero experience of running this complex firm are preferable to the last lot.",

      "bodyText": "A day at the races is not usually associated with a hard-nosed investment strategy for your personal savings. Yet this week the Jockey Club, which runs Aintree, Epsom, Newmarket and a dozen other racecourses, announced that it had raised \u00a325m from ordinary investors by issuing retail bonds. All told, around 2,100 punters pitched in, putting up an average of \u00a312,000 each for five-year bonds that will help pay for the \u00a345m redevelopment of Cheltenham racecourse. In return, they get interest at 7.75% \u2013 4.75% of it in cash and a 3% \"reward\" that can be spent on discounted race tickets, as well as a drink to drown their sorrows afterwards. \"It's a great sign of trust in the strength of our 263-year-old brand,\" said Paul Fisher, group managing director of the Jockey Club. The Jockey Club is the latest in a line of companies funding their business by tapping customers. From middle England's favourite department store, John Lewis, to truck and haulage firm Eddie Stobart, firms have been piling into the market for retail bonds. This weekend, Australian company CBD Energy is launching a four-year bond intended to raise \u00a37.5m to fund wind farms and solar power in the UK. Eco-conscious savers have had the option to buy into wind power since Ecotricity launched its four-year bond in 2011. But upmarket chocolatier Hotel Chocolat beat it to the concept: it launched a mini-bond, sometimes called a \"passion bond\", in 2010. Investors were paid in chocolate every two months. Boutique hotel website Mr and Mrs Smith allowed its investors to recoup their investment in discounted mini-breaks. At a time when banks are chary of lending to many businesses, retail bonds have boomed, attracting savers searching for a better return on their money in an era of historically low interest rates. \"Companies were being charged far too much for access to capital, and at the same time investors were being squeezed,\" says Daniel Aitkenhead of stockbroker Killik and Co. \"This is making capital cheaper for UK plc and it suits retail investors who are just desperate for income.\" In 2010 the London Stock Exchange created a new trading platform, the Order book for Retail Bonds, to tap this demand. Since then, the ORB has raised more than \u00a33.3bn from 36 retail bonds issued by companies such as Tesco Personal Finance and the National Grid, as well as bailed-out banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. ORB bonds are distinct from mini-bonds, a smaller category covering the Jockey Club, Hotel Chocolat and John Lewis. Unlike mini-bonds, ORB bonds can be bought and sold, which is an advantage for investors, according to financial analysts. Mini-bonds cannot be traded, so the buyer is tied to the fortunes of the company. \"Ultimately these are loans to companies, or loans to organisations, and if you are lending money to a company and the company goes bust, your cash is at risk,\" says Danny Cox, head of financial planning at Hargreaves Lansdown. The allure of a day at the races, or a box of pricey chocolates, often allied to tempting interest rates, can make mini-bonds seem like a smart move. But small investors may not be well-placed to get the best deal. Damien Fahy of financial adviser Dennehy Weller and Co says: \"It is very difficult to perceive the value of a retail bond given that you have to have an understanding of credit ratings and the potential risks of default \u2026 I don't think that retail investors are best-placed to make that call.\" Savers locked into mini bonds for five years may also end up wondering if they've backed the wrong horse. \"What might seem like a decent rate of return or decent rate now may not seem like it when inflation kicks in,\" Fahy says. He advises ordinary savers against buying mini-bonds, which are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. \"If you want to take an investment risk don't go into that realm, which offers no protection. You would be better off buying a corporate bond fund, because the bond fund manager is paid to maximise returns.\" Cox also sounds a wary note. People need to understand what they are buying,\" he says. \"If you do decide to invest in one of these retail bonds, or mini bonds, I think it should be a small amount of your portfolio and you should really understand what you are doing.\" Diehard fans of horseracing might think differently, of course. The Jockey Club is not offering a particularly attractive yield, according to Cox. But he adds: \"If you are going to spend that money anyway, then it is more attractive than it would be to an investor who never goes to the racecourse, and is never likely to.\"",
