      "bodyText": "Lloyds Pharmacy has announced it will close nearly 200 stores across England because of changes in government policy, with its parent company also blaming funding cuts and the apprenticeship levy. In an internal letter to staff Cormac Tobin, the managing director of Lloyds Pharmacy\u2019s owner, Celesio UK, said around 190 pharmacies would cease to trade through a combination of closures and disinvestments. The leaked internal memo to staff, which was verified by a spokesman for Celesio UK, said the business had been hit by pharmacy funding cuts, as well as higher business rates and the apprenticeship levy, which had made \u201cmarket conditions challenging\u201d. \u201cCommunity pharmacy needs to adapt to the changing requirements of patients and the NHS, indeed it should be part of the solution to an overstretched health service,\u201d Tobin said in the memo. \u201cTo achieve this, we need a new operational framework that creates a thriving pharmacy network that continues to offer essential integrated healthcare and is rooted in local communities.\u201d The number of staff who could be affected by the closures was not confirmed by a spokeswoman for Celesio UK, who said current employees may be moved to other locations. But some pharmacists have taken to social media to warn of hundreds of job losses. Aisha Adnan, a locum pharmacist, posted: \u201cA branch [on] average has five staff and that equates to roughly 1,000 staff being laid off, plus so many pharmacists and locum pharmacists [will] lose their jobs and patients [will] lose their trusted services. This is not the picture of health.\u201d Thorrun Govind, a pharmacist in north-west England, said: \u201cThis is going to impact the most vulnerable patients and, with the GP crisis and pressures on the NHS, the funding cuts were most unwelcome. \u201cPatients need an accessible healthcare professional to provide advice, medicines and so much more to reduce pressure on other NHS resources. The closure of these pharmacies is disappointing when pharmacists should be supported to provide much more for the NHS. \u201cI would like to see independent pharmacists prescribers enabled to allow pharmacies on the high street to become triage centres not a reduction in pharmacies.\u201d Tobin said the company would be taking steps to support staff and minimise disruption for patients. Julie Cooper, the shadow minister for community care, described the decision as \u201ca devastating blow for Lloyds Pharmacy staff and their patients right across the country. The government is taking hundreds of millions of pounds of support away from pharmacies and now we see that it is patients who will pay the price.\u201d Cooper urged ministers to outline plans to support \u201cthe hundreds of Lloyds Pharmacy jobs that are now at risk\u201d and explain what support will be put in place for patients reliant on their service. \u201cThe Tories are prioritising saving money over care. They cannot just expect elderly patients to get their prescriptions via an online service, without any support with their medication,\u201d she said. A spokeswoman for No 10 said there were measures in place to ensure people could access a pharmacy. She said: \u201cThere are almost 12,000 private pharmacies in England and these closures make up just 1.6% of the number. We don\u2019t have full information on the announcement as yet, but we do make sure that patients can access pharmacists where they need to.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "ECB to halve bond buying as it plans to scale back quantitative easing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank (ECB) is to begin weaning the eurozone countries off billions of euros of monetary stimulus, edging back to normality following the recovery from the depths of the sovereign debt crisis nearly a decade ago. The central bank announced on Thursday it would halve its bond-buying programme \u2013 used to temper surging debt costs and stimulate lending to households and businesses \u2013 from \u20ac60bn to \u20ac30bn a month starting from January. The ECB pledged a gradual withdrawal of so-called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d to smooth the return to normality without rattling financial markets. The euro marginally lost some ground against other major currencies following the announcement, expected by City traders due to previous hints from the ECB over the course of its actions. The beginning of the process to unwind five years of unconventional monetary policy comes as eurozone growth gathers pace after years in the doldrums. The 19 countries out of the 28 European Union member states who use the single currency collectively grew at twice the rate of Britain in the three months to June. Mario Draghi, the ECB president, said growth in the eurozone was solid and broad based. \u201cThe latest data and survey results point to unabated growth momentum in the second half of this year,\u201d he said. However, Draghi cautioned that loose monetary police \u2013 from quantitative easing and low interest rates \u2013 would be required for some time, despite the recovery, as the expansion in the eurozone remained conditional on significant support. This will mean the reduction in bond-buying will take place gradually. The ECB left interest rates unchanged at 0% and its deposit rate, which it pays for banks to park money with it overnight, at -0.4%. When the rate is negative, banks pay the ECB to deposit money, encouraging them to lend rather than store it with the central bank. From January the ECB will continue buying \u20ac30bn of bonds sold by countries in the euro area and the debts of eurozone companies on a monthly basis, which has the effect of flooding the banks that own them with money \u2013 which can in turn be lent to stimulate economic activity. The process also pushes down interest rates offered to customers, which makes new loans cheaper. The ECB said it would continue the monthly acquisitions until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary. It also said it could increase the purchases in terms of size and duration should the economy deteriorate. The central bank will also continue to reinvest the proceeds from the bonds as they mature, over an \u201cextended period of time\u201d after the ultimate end of its purchasing programme. This is designed to help further smooth the unwinding process. Speaking in Frankfurt following the announcement of the decision, Draghi said: \u201cOur programme is flexible enough that we can adjust its size. We can carry through smoothly and that\u2019s been the evidence we have given until now. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop suddenly. It\u2019s never been our view that things should stop suddenly.\u201d Announcing the gradual reduction, which is credited with countering the risks of a fragmentation of the eurozone and preventing the single currency from unravelling, brings the ECB\u2019s policy position closer to that of the US Federal Reserve, which has already begun unwinding its programme of bond-buying. The US has gone further, by stopping the reinvestment of the proceeds of its own scheme, aiming to cut its $4.5tn (\u00a33.4tn) balance sheet from October, initially by just $10bn per month. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is yet to move to unwind its \u00a3445bn bond-buying programme. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has said he would prefer to hike UK interest rates before beginning to withdraw quantitative easing. Ian Stewart, chief economist at the accountancy firm Deloitte, said the ECB move amounted to \u201csoftly, softly\u201d removal of loose monetary policy. \u201cWilliam McChesney Martin, a previous Fed Chairman, once said that the job of the Fed was \u2018to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going\u2019. The ECB certainly isn\u2019t taking away the punchbowl, Draghi is saying that so long as everyone keeps having a good time they plan to put less punch in,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Germany\u2019s stock exchange has resigned to avoid distractions caused by allegations that he has been involved in insider dealing. The Frankfurt-based Deutsche B\u00f6rse announced Carsten Kengeter would leave at the end of the year just days after a German court refused to back a settlement over the allegations under which he had agreed to a \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3443,281) penalty and the B\u00f6rse \u20ac10.5m. The allegations stem from December 2015 when he bought Deutsche B\u00f6rse shares worth about \u20ac4.5m (\u00a33.8m). Two months later, in February 2016, Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the London Stock Exchange unveiled merger plans, an announcement which sent their share prices soaring. Those merger plans have since been abandoned. The B\u00f6rse said the resignation of Kengeter \u2013 whose family had remained in London while he commuted for his job \u2013 was accepted with \u201cdeep regret\u201d after a board meeting. The aim was to allow the company \u201cto focus its energy back onto clients, business and growth and to avoid further burdens caused by the ongoing investigation\u201d. Joachim Faber, chairman of the B\u00f6rse, thanked Kengeter and said he respected the decision. \u201cWe understand that the decision he took in the light of the difficult situation was in the best interest of the company. Nevertheless, the supervisory board regrets losing in Carsten Kengeter a CEO who laid the foundation for a successful future of Deutsche B\u00f6rse in a significant way.\u201d Kengeter said it was not an easy decision but said: \u201cIn the light of the public accusations and allegations, I am taking this step to protect Deutsche B\u00f6rse in particular. \u201cI will thoroughly cooperate with the authorities until the end of the investigation. With this decision, I am paving the way for a new beginning for Deutsche B\u00f6rse.\u201d The B\u00f6rse has previously said that the accusations against Kengeter were \u201cwithout foundation\u201d, that merger discussions with the London market between the two chairmen and chief executives did not begin until the second half of January 2016 and the shares were part of a bonus plan. It confirmed on Thursday that was still the situation. Kengeter was appointed chief executive of Deutsche B\u00f6rse in 2014 and took up the role in June 2015. His family is based in west London. A German, he was educated at Middlesex University and the London School of Economics, joining Goldman Sachs in 1997 and becoming a partner before moving to the Swiss bank UBS in 2008 where he was head of investment banking before leaving in 2013.",

The aim was to allow the company \u201cto focus its energy back onto clients, business and growth and to avoid further burdens caused by the ongoing investigation\u201d.<br></p> <p>Joachim Faber, chairman of the B\u00f6rse, thanked Kengeter and said he respected the decision. \u201cWe understand that the decision he took in the light of the difficult situation was in the best interest of the company. Nevertheless, the supervisory board regrets losing in Carsten Kengeter a CEO who laid the foundation for a successful future of Deutsche B\u00f6rse in a significant way.\u201d</p> <p>Kengeter said it was not an easy decision but said: \u201cIn the light of the public accusations and allegations, I am taking this step to protect Deutsche B\u00f6rse in particular.<br></p> <p>\u201cI will thoroughly cooperate with the authorities until the end of the investigation. With this decision, I am paving the way for a new beginning for Deutsche B\u00f6rse.\u201d</p> <p>The B\u00f6rse has previously said that the accusations against Kengeter were \u201cwithout foundation\u201d, that merger discussions with the London market between the two chairmen and chief executives did not begin until the second half of January 2016 and the shares were part of a bonus plan. It confirmed on Thursday that was still the situation.</p> <p>Kengeter was appointed chief executive of Deutsche B\u00f6rse in 2014 and took up the role in June 2015.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s super-rich hold the greatest concentration of wealth since the US Gilded Age at the turn of the 20th century, when families like the Carnegies, Rockefellers and Vanderbilts controlled vast fortunes. Billionaires increased their combined global wealth by almost a fifth last year to a record $6tn (\u00a34.5tn) \u2013 more than twice the GDP of the UK. There are now 1,542 dollar billionaires across the world, after 145 multi-millionaires saw their wealth tick over into nine-zero fortunes last year, according to the UBS / PwC Billionaires report. Josef Stadler, the lead author of the report and UBS\u2019s head of global ultra high net worth, said his billionaire clients were concerned that growing inequality between rich and poor could lead to a \u201cstrike back\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection point,\u201d Stadler said. \u201cWealth concentration is as high as in 1905, this is something billionaires are concerned about. The problem is the power of interest on interest \u2013 that makes big money bigger and, the question is to what extent is that sustainable and at what point will society intervene and strike back?\u201d Stadler added: \u201cWe are now two years into the peak of the second Gilded Age.\u201d He said the \u201c$1bn question\u201d was how society would react to the concentration of so much money in the hands of so few. Anger at so-called robber barron families who built up vast fortunes from monopolies in US rail, oil, steel and banking in the late 19th century, an era of rapid industrialisation and growing inequality in America that became known as the Gilded Age, led to President Roosevelt breaking up companies and trusts and increasing taxes on the wealthy in the early 1900s. \u201cWill there be similarities in the way society reacts to this gilded age?,\u201d Stadler asked. \u201cWill the second age end or will it proceed?\u201d The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently said western governments should force the top 1% of earners to pay more more tax to try to reduce dangerous levels of inequality. Stadler said media coverage of inequality and the super-rich suggested there would be an \u201cinflection point\u201d, but he said \u201cthe perception that billionaires make money for themselves at the expense of the wider population\u201d was incorrect. He added that 98% of billionaires\u2019 wealth found its way back into wider society and said the world\u2019s super-rich employed 27.7 million people \u2013 not far behind the number of people in the UK workforce. Billionaires\u2019 fortunes increased by 17% on average last year due to the strong performance of their companies and investments, particularly in technology and commodities. The billionaires\u2019 average return was double that achieved by the world\u2019s stock markets and far more than the average interest rates of just 0.35% offered by UK instant-access high street bank accounts. Stadler said that the super-rich\u2019s concerns over public perceptions that they were getting wealthier at the expense of the wider population had led them to make greater philanthropic gifts and spend their money on public art galleries and sports teams. \u201cYou could say it is about ego and wanting to show off and sit in the front row,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is also about giving back.\u201d The report said billionaires now accounted for 72 of the world\u2019s 200 top art collectors, up from 28 in 1995. \u201cWhile not a fresh phenomenon, private museums are growing in number, especially in Asia,\u201d the annual UBS report said. \u201cMotivated by their passion for art, and often encouraged by favourable tax treatment, art collectors are setting up private museums all around the world to share their collections with the public.\u201d Recent gallery openings include The Broad in Los Angeles, funded by Eli Broad \u2013 the world\u2019s 65th richest person with a $7.4bn fortune. Japanese billionaire Soichiro Fukutake is building a series of galleries to house his art collection on islands in Japan\u2019s Seto Inland Sea. \u201cThe billionaire population is concerned about [inequality] and that may be why we are seeing this acceleration of publicly displaying art collections or partnering with public institutions so more of the public can enjoy what they have,\u201d said John Matthews, UBS head of private wealth management. \u201cI think it\u2019s a big part of investment in sports franchises \u2013 it\u2019s a way for them to say \u2018I made all this money and I did it in Cleveland, Ohio, I\u2019ve got to give back to my community and one way I\u2019m going to do that is to make sure the stadium is great\u2019.\u201d The report found that 140 of the world\u2019s top sports teams are owned by just 109 billionaires, with two-thirds of NBA and NFL teams owned by billionaires. In the UK, nine of the 20 Premier League teams have billionaire owners, including Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, and Sheikh Mansour at Manchester City. \u201cThere is an acceleration of these transactions as we speak, with major buyers coming from China,\u201d Stadler said. One of the billionaires told the UBS researchers he had bought sports teams because it opened doors to \u201cstars, sheikhs, famous businessmen and regular guys from around the world, all in the same room, all talking only about the ball\u201d. America\u2019s Gilded Age The Gilded Age, from the 1870s until the early 1900s, was boom time for America, as rail opened up the country and higher wages saw an influx of millions of immigrants from Europe. The term to describe the era of rapid industrialisation and social upheaval in the US was coined by historians in the 1920s, and was derived from Mark Twain\u2019s 1873 novel The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today. Money from London and Paris poured into the US and fuelled industrialisation and rail development, including the first transcontinental railroad that opened up vast areas of territory to mining and ranching, and cut travel time from New York to San Francisco from six months to six days. Several industries, including oil, steel, sugar and cotton, became controlled by a few large companies, run by trusts. The trusts controlled every aspect of production, from raw materials to manufacturing and sales, enabling them to operate as monopolies in their industrial sector and keep out competitors. The trusts turned their owners into some of the richest people to ever live, and whose descendants still feature oin annual rich lists. Anger at the wealth accrued by so few people at the apparent expense of their poorly treated workers led industrialists, including Cornelius Vanderbilt (railroads), Andrew Carnegie (steel), JP Morgan (finance) and John Jacob Astor (real estate and fur), to be dubbed robber barons. Historian TJ Stiles said the term was adopted to \u201cconjure up visions of titanic monopolists who crushed competitors, rigged markets, and corrupted government. In their greed and power, legend has it, they held sway over a helpless democracy.\u201d President Theodore Roosevelt, elected in 1901, moved to break up the monopolies. John D Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil was split into 34 separate companies, including the predecessors of Exxon, BP and Chevron. The Gilded Age gave way to the Progressive Era, when the backlash against the excesses and inequalities of the earlier period prompted widespread social activism and political reform.",

      "bodyText": "Crumbs, what a busy day. Here\u2019s a quick recap of the main events. The European Central Bank has halved its asset purchase stimulus programme, to \u20ac30bn per month, for another nine months. But the ECB also left little doubt that it intends to keep buying bonds for even longer than announced today, in an attempt to get inflation. The euro has fallen following the announcement. In the UK, a gloomy retail report has raised new fears over the strength of the recovery. The CBI reported that retail sales were falling at the fastest pace since 2009 this month. Economists say the survey shows that consumers are being forced to cut back, due to rising inflation and economic uncertainty. Britain\u2019s car industry is also struggling. Production fell by 4% in September, mainly due to a sharp decline in domestic demand. Barclays is having its worst day since the day after the EU referendum. Shares are down by 7.5% today, after it reported a decline in earnings at its investment banking arm. And Britain\u2019s pay gap has also narrowed, to 9.1%. But it\u2019s not shrinking fast enough, with experts warning it will take \u2018decades\u2019 to eliminate at the current rate... That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, has a good take on Mario Draghi\u2019s comments: \u201cThis is softly, softly tapering. William McChesney Martin, a previous Fed Chairman, once said that the job of the Fed was \u2018to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going.\u2019 The ECB certainly isn\u2019t taking away the punchbowl, Mr Draghi is saying that so long everyone keeps having a good time they plan to put less punch in.\u201d Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says: \u201cTen years on from the financial crash, the era of quantitative easing is yet to run its course in Europe. Draghi confirmed that the bond buying programme would be tapered, but it has hardly come to an end. This slow, steady and widely predicted approach hopes to rein in the Euro from rising further, which is limiting the earnings capacity of European exporters, at the same time as avoiding a European taper tantrum in the markets. Whether one can be achieved without the other remains to be seen. Paul Rayner, Head of Government Bonds at Royal London Asset Management, agrees that the European Central Bank\u2019s QE programme will continue for some time: In our view, the tightening of European monetary policy will continue be a very gradual process, with further comments made today that there are no plans for a cliff-edge end to the bond purchase programme. As Mario Draghi himself put it during today\u2019s press conference, the reinvestment of principal payments will be \u2018massive\u2019, and it\u2019s worth remembering that despite the squeeze on liquidity entering the markets, the ECB will still be buying \u20ac30 billion per month. Viktor Nossek, Director of Research at asset management firm WisdomTree, predicts that bond prices could suffer from the ECB\u2019s decision: \u201cInvestors in Europe should consider hedging their fixed income exposures, now that the ECB is cutting back asset purchases from the start of 2018. \u201cGerman bunds could now be in the firing line, as the cut back could spark a taper tantrum in Europe. Mario Draghi has done a good job of talking down the euro too. The single currency has now shed one cent against the US dollar to $1.172, a three-week low. Traders have clearly got the message that the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme remains \u2018open-ended\u2019, and that it has not intention of raising interest rates any time soon. That was a pretty dovish performance from Mario Draghi. An effective performance too, as the ECB president makes it clear that he expects maintain loose monetary policy for some time, despite the economic recovery. Here are the key points: 1) The European Central Bank has halved the pace of its bond-buying asset purchase programme. From January, it will only buy \u20ac30bn of government and corporate bonds each month, down from \u20ac60bn, for at least the next nine months. 2) But..... this doesn\u2019t mean that the ECB\u2019s QE programme is on borrowed time. President Draghi has insisted that today\u2019s decision is not \u2018tapering\u2019, meaning the Bank expects to keep buying bonds beyond September 2018. This was perhaps the key quote: The decision today is for an open-ended programme ... it\u2019s not going to stop suddenly. The large majority of the Governing Council expresses a preference for keeping it open-ended. There is still a large amount of uncertainty, so it was only prudent. So while the ECB has taken a step towards ending its ultra-loose monetary stance, we\u2019re not there yet.... 3) Draghi was upbeat about the recovery in the eurozone recovery, pointing out (twice) that seven million jobs have been created in the last four years. He declared that: \u201cThe latest data and survey results point to unabated growth momentum in the second half of this year.\u201d Today\u2019s governing council was held in a positive atmosphere, he added. All the members mentioned growth momentum, improving employment ...investment is actually picking up. The earning capacity of households is picking up, so disposable income is increasing. 4) But the ECB still sees \u2018muted\u2019 inflation pressures. That\u2019s why it intends to keep pumping euros into the economy through its asset purchase scheme. \u201cDomestic price pressures are still muted overall and theeconomic outlook and the path of inflation remain conditional oncontinued support from monetary policy. Therefore, an ampledegree of monetary stimulus remains necessary.\u201d 5) On geopolitics, Draghi said the ECB was watching developments in Catalonia very closely. \u201cIt is very difficult to comment on developments that change every day. We are following what is happening ... to conclude now that there will be instability is premature.\u201d Q: Last year, when the ECB cut QE from \u20ac80bn to \u20ac60bn per month, you insisted that you weren\u2019t \u2018tapering\u2019 your bond buying programme. So is today\u2019s announcement tapering? No, Draghi replies. That underlines how the programme is likely to keep running beyond next September (but possibly at a lower rate than \u20ac30bn per month). And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Draghi\u2019s insistence that QE is \u2018open-ended\u2019 is fuelling speculation that the ECB could keep buying government bonds until 2019. And that would mean interest rates could remain at their current record lows until 2020! Q: If the eurozone recovery turns out to be stronger than you expect, might you reduce the pace of the asset purchase scheme? This is today\u2019s decision, Draghi shoots back, adding \u201cThis is our commitment, we don\u2019t foresee changes now.\u201d Q: The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates 15 months after ending its bond-purchase programme - might the ECB take a similar approach? We don\u2019t have a fixed timeframe, Draghi replies. Comparisons with other jurisdictions aren\u2019t really appropriate. Q: What might happen to the ECB\u2019s stimulus programme after September 2018? Mario Draghi says the programme is \u201copen-ended\u201d, meaning it won\u2019t suddenly stop buying bonds next October. That will probably reassure the markets, who have developed a taste for very loose monetary policy and don\u2019t want the ECB\u2019s punch bowl to run dry. Q: Is political uncertainty in Catalonia a risk to financial stability in Spain, and in the euro area at a whole? Mario Draghi says the ECB is following developments with \u201cgreat attention\u201d, but it is \u201cvery difficult to comment on developments that change every day\u201d. To conclude now that there will be financial stability risks would be premature. We have to see what will happen.... Q: Why has the ECB decided to keep expanding its asset purchase programme, at a time when the US Federal Reserve is cutting its own QE scheme? Draghi doesn\u2019t accept the suggestion that the ECB is wrong to keep buying bonds. The US recovery is \u201cway more advanced\u201d than in the eurozone, meaning Europe\u2019s inflation outlook is \u201cway behind\u201d, he says firmly. Some reaction to Draghi\u2019s comments: Q: Was today\u2019s decision unanimous? No, there were different viewpoints, Draghi replies. He says there was a \u201cbroad consensus on several issues, and a large majority on other issues.\u201d Q: How did the ECB go about preparing the public for today\u2019s changes? My understanding is that the market reaction was pretty muted, Draghi replies, even though the policy announcement was fairly important. That shows that our communication was pretty effective. Draghi says there are global factors influencing inflation...but the ECB is focused on the factors closer to home, which it can influence. He points out that the eurozone has created more than seven million jobs in the last four years - a sign that his policies are bearing fruit. Draghi is hammering home that the ECB will continue to reinvest the stock of existing assets bought under QE since 2015. This has become \u201cmore and more important\u201d as we\u2019ve bought \u201ca lot of bonds\u201d smiles Draghi: The ECB has bought something like two trillion euros of bonds since it plunged into QE in 2015. Draghi\u2019s point is that the programme will still have a major impact on the economy, as the ECB plans to buy new bonds when its existing holdings mature. So there are no plans to start cutting the size of the programme - something the US Federal Reserve is just starting to do. Q: Did you discuss alternative courses of action, before deciding to cut the pace of the APP to \u20ac30bn per month? No, says Draghi. The \u201catmosphere was pretty positive\u201d at today\u2019s meeting, thanks to the increase in employment across the eurozone and rising wages. The discussion thus \u2018converged\u2019 on the idea of halving the pace of the QE programme, and running for at least another nine months, although there were \u201csome differences\u201d about the details. Onto questions. Q: Did the ECB discuss changing the composition of the assets bought under your stimulus programme? No, Draghi replies. But the press get more details later today on how the asset purchase programme will evolve, and re-invest its assets (as bonds mature) Mario Draghi then issues his tradition call on eurozone politicians to do better. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy, other parties must also act, he says. That includes \u201csubstantially\u201d speeding up the implementation of structural reforms in \u201call eurozone countries\u201d. Draghi also calls for \u201cmore growth-friendly\u201d fiscal politics across the eurozone. Economic growth in the eurozone continued \u201cunabated\u201d, declares Draghi proudly. He says there has been an upswing in business investment. Construction investment has also improved, and eurozone exports are benefitting from the improved picture in the global economy. But.... there are also downside risks, Draghi continues, including \u2018global factors\u2019 and \u2018foreign exchange\u2019 effects (ie, the recent strengthening of the euro). Draghi is talking about how the ECB has \u2018recalibrated\u2019 its bond-purchase programme. Turning to the economic picture, Draghi says that domestic prices pressures are still muted. Thus, \u201ccontinued monetary policy support\u201d is needed to underpin the economic outlook and keep inflation on track. Mario Draghi begins by telling reporters that his governing council conducted a \u201cthorough\u201d analysis of the outlook for inflation in the eurozone today. Draghi confirms that the ECB decided to leave interest rates at their current record low, and expects to leave borrowing costs at these levels for an extended period. He also confirms that the ECB will maintain its QE programme for another nine months, at a pace of \u20ac30bn per month, \u201cor beyond if necessary\u201d. The ECB stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme in terms of size and or duration if needed, he adds. Speaking particularly crisply, Draghi concludes: Today\u2019s monetary policy decisions were taken to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are still needed for a sustained return of inflation to levels that are close to, but below 2%. Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is explaining today\u2019s decisions to the press pack. You can watch it live here: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, reckons the ECB was right to maintain its QE programme for another nine months. She writes: \u201cThe Euro area recovery is certainly becoming more entrenched, with broad-based growth across countries and sectors of the economy. The euro strength seen so far is unlikely to derail the growth story or pave way for a return of deflationary worries. At the same time, however, given the remaining slack in the labour market, inflation is far below the target and is likely to rise only at a very sluggish pace. Stupnytska adds that the ECB will be concerned that the Catalan independence crissi could have a \u201cnon-negligible\u201d impact on growth. German conservative MEP Markus Ferber has heavily criticised the ECB\u2019s decision to extend its stimulus programme. Ferber argues that there\u2019s no justification for buying tens of billions of government and corporate bonds each month, with newly created money. Ferber says: \u201cThe Eurozone is growing strongly, inflation is picking up, and downside risks are minimal. It seems like the textbook case for the right time to phase out quantitative easing and start a normalisation of monetary policy. Instead the ECB locks in their flawed monetary policy approach for the months to come and defers normalisation indefinitely. I am disappointed that the ECB missed yet another chance to initialise a normalisation of monetary policy. The asset purchasing program will keep distorting the market and lays the foundations for the next crisis.\u201d The euro has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar since the ECB announcement, to $1.176. That suggests that some traders had expected a more dramatic cut to the Bank\u2019s stimulus programme. In theory, the ECB could have decided to buy even fewer bonds per month, or only extended the QE programme by another six months, rather than nine. My colleague Richard Partington tweets: Danske Bank have helpfully summarised today\u2019s ECB statement: BREAKING: The European Central Bank has slowed the pace of its stimulus programme. From January 2018, the ECB will buy \u20ac30bn of new bonds each month -- that\u2019s down from \u20ac60bn per month at present. The ECB\u2019s governing council has decided to continue this quantitative easing programme for at least another nine months - or longer if needed. That means the ECB has taken another step towards ending the era of ultra-loose monetary policy. The ECB says: From January 2018 the net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the APP [Asset Purchase Programme] in terms of size and/or duration. The ECB has also left borrowing costs unchanged. That means the headline eurozone interest rate remains at 0.0%, and banks face a negative interest rate of -0.4% for leaving money in the central bank\u2019s vaults. Details and reaction to follow! After a busy morning, City traders are now turning their attention to Frankfurt. The European Central Bank is poised to announce the decisions taken at today\u2019s governing council meeting. We\u2019re expecting the ECB to leave interest rates at their record lows, but also outline how it could slow its bond-buying programme (our opening blogpost has more details). The decision comes at 12.45pm BST, followed by a press conference with president Mario Draghi at 1.30pm. Labour MP Anneliese Dodds, who represents Oxford East, tweets: In other bad news...the Unite union in Northern Ireland has warned that aerospace company Bombardier is planning to cut 280 jobs at its Belfast plant. Bombardier faces legal action in the United States from rival Boeing over the development of the C-Series jet. Boeing alleges its Canadian competitor has been receiving unfair state subsidies to build the new plane. Unite point out however that only last month Bombardier announced a new business partnership with Airbus. Davy Thompson, Unite\u2019s regional co-ordinating officer said today: \u201cThe jobs to be lost are functional as opposed to operational meaning losses will be concentrated outside the main production lines but this will be devastating news for the workers concerned and their families in the run-up to the end of the year. Unite is calling on management to review this decision. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says UK retailers will be hoping the Bank of England doesn\u2019t raise interest rates at its November meeting: These latest numbers from the CBI will only add to the mixed economic signals to be digested by the Bank of England next week when it decides whether to increase interest rates for the first time in over a decade. Retailers will breathe a sigh of relief if the bank chooses not to increase rates and further burden consumers with additional mortgage costs, at a time when they are already feeling a bit of a pinch. As we enter the key Christmas trading period, the retail industry is desperately in need of some festive cheer. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on the retail sales figures: The fastest monthly fall in high street sales since the height of the recession in 2009 has raised fears for the retail sector ahead of the crucial Christmas trading period. A survey by the the CBI found that 50% of retailers suffered declining sales in September while only 15% benefited from an increase, leaving a rounded balance of -36%, the lowest since March 2009. The business lobby group said the survey showed retailers were \u201cfeeling the pinch\u201d from rising inflation, which has eaten into consumer incomes and squeezed profit margins. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI chief economist, said: \u201cWhile retail sales can be volatile from month to month, the steep drop in sales in October echoes other recent data pointing to a marked softening in consumer demand.\u201d The gloomy CBI survey came as Debenhams warned of an \u201cuncertain\u201d environment on the high street in the run up to Christmas after suffering a 44% dive in profits. The department store confirmed the closure of two stores, in Eltham, south London, and at Farnborough, Hampshire, affecting about 80 jobs, as sales on the high street continue to fall. They are the first of up to 10 UK branches that Debenhams has earmarked for closure.... More here: Debenhams, the UK department store chain, has added to the uncertainty in the UK retail sector today. It reported a 44% slide in pre-tax profits at the company over the last 12 months, and warned that the retail environment is challenging. Sergio Bucher, CEO, says: The environment remains uncertain and we face tough comparatives over the key Christmas weeks. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, says Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze is hurting the retail sector: \u201cThese results are definitely worrying for retailers as they are clearly starting to feel the impact of inflation. \u201cThis survey doesn\u2019t cover the whole market, however it could be a good indication that consumers are being more wary in the run up to Christmas and aren\u2019t willing to part with the shiny new pounds in their pocket quite as quickly as before. Wages aren\u2019t rising in line with the inflation which could be one reason why sales are down. \u201cIn the run up to Christmas it\u2019s important people don\u2019t overspend and stick to a tight budget, however after the results of this survey businesses will be counting on us splashing out at Christmas.\u201d The news that UK retailers suffered an October sales slide could weigh on sterling. The pound has lost almost half a cent today, to $1.322. It\u2019s also down 0.3% against the euro at \u20ac1.119. Consumer spending has been a key driver of UK growth this year. Thus, today\u2019s retail slowdown may worry Bank of England policymakers, who must decide whether to raise interest rates next week. \u2018Non-specialist\u2019 goods shops, such as department stores, suffered the brunt of the spending slowdown this month. Britons also cut back on furniture and carpets, in another sign that consumers are reining in their spending. Here\u2019s the details: The CBI says: Sales volumes expanded in other normal goods (74%), recreational goods (+64%) and hardware &amp; DIY (43%). Meanwhile, sales volumes decreased in specialist food &amp; drink (-32%) and non-specialised goods (i.e. department stores (-45%). Economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon has been forced to redraw his graph to capture the tumble in retail sales this month! The decline in UK retail sales shows that consumers are cutting back, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. It\u2019s a bad sign for growth.... Today\u2019s CBI retail sales report is much weaker than the City expected. Analysts had expected a majority of firms to report rising sales. So the news that only 15% of retailers are seeing a pick-up in demand, while 50% are suffering a decline, is a worry. Here\u2019s the details of the retail sales slump: BREAKING: UK retail sales have suffered their sharpest monthly decline since the financial crisis. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s monthly survey of the UK retail sector. It found that just 15% of retailers reported that sales volumes were up in October on a year ago, whilst 50% said they were down. That gives a rounded balance of -36%, the worst reading since March 2009 - when Britain had fallen into recession after the financial crisis. Firms reported that sales were below average for the time of year. Suppliers have also been hit -- with orders dropping at the fastest rate since March 2009. Here are the key findings from the report: 15% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in October on a year ago, whilst 50% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of -36%. This significantly undershot expectations (+23%), and was the steepest fall in sales volumes since March 2009 (-44%), during the financial crisis 14% of respondents expect sales volumes to increase next month, with 12% expecting a decrease, giving a rounded balance of +3% 14% of retailers placed more orders with suppliers than they did a year ago, whilst 57% placed fewer orders, giving a balance of -43%. This was the fastest decline since March 2009 (-47%) Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, blames the cost of living squeeze, due to the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote. \u201cIt\u2019s clear retailers are beginning to really feel the pinch from higher inflation. While retail sales can be volatile from month to month, the steep drop in sales in October echoes other recent data pointing to a marked softening in consumer demand. The survey only covers 106 firms, including 49 retailers, so it needs treating with some caution. But such a sharp decline is certainly worth noting... Deep cuts in inward migration from other EU countries after Brexit would seriously hit Scotland\u2019s economy, the Scottish government has warned, after new projections showed it would lead to a fall in the country\u2019s working age population. New data from the National Records of Scotland published on Thursday shows all future population growth depends on continued inward migration from the rest of the UK and overseas, because birthrates are projected to fall while numbers of pensionable adults to increase by 25% by 2041. Based on existing trends, the NRS, a government agency that monitors population figures, said Scotland\u2019s population will rise from 5.40 million in 2016 to 5.58 million in 2026 \u2013 an increase entirely due to net inwards migration. By 2041, Scotland will have 1.32m pensioners, it said, but the number of working Scots would rise by just 1%. In a separate paper, the NRS also modelled the impact of a 50% cut in EU inwards migration, and said that would cut a population rise to 4%, while an end to EU migration would see Scotland\u2019s population peak in 2032 and decline afterwards. Under that scenario, Scotland\u2019s wage-earning population would fall by 3%. The NRS made clear these figures were illustrative and not official data (a distinction the Scottish government\u2019s press release did not highlight) but Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish culture and external affairs secretary, said they underlined \u201cthe critical importance of maintaining inward migration to Scotland.\u201d Hyslop said: \u201cThe stark reality outlined in today\u2019s figures is that projected growth in Scotland\u2019s population will slow significantly if levels of EU migration are reduced. And in that scenario the population is also predicted to start declining again within the next 25 years. \u201cThat would have a significant negative impact on Scotland\u2019s economy and our ability to fund the public services we will need for an ageing population.\u201d Britain\u2019s gender pay gap remains too high, and is falling too slowly, says TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady. Here\u2019s her take on today\u2019s pay figures: \u201cThe full-time gender pay gap has inched a bit smaller. But there is still a chasm between men and women\u2019s earnings. \u201cAt this rate it\u2019ll take decades for women to get paid the same as men. \u201cThe government needs to crank up the pressure on employers. Companies shouldn\u2019t just be made to publish their gender pay gaps. They should be forced to explain how they\u2019ll close them. \u201cAnd those bosses who flout the law should be fined.\u201d Good news! Britain\u2019s gender pay gap has hit its lowest level in at least two decades. Bad news! Women are still being paid over 9% less than men. That\u2019s according to the latest Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings from the Office for National Statistics. It found that the gender pay gap for full-time staff dropped to 9.1% in the year to April, down from 9.4%. That\u2019s the lowest level since the survey began in 1997, as this chart shows: It\u2019s illegal to pay a woman less than a man for doing the same job. But still, the gender pay gap persists. The ONS says there are several reasons, including: more women work in lower-paid jobs or sectors women are more likely to work part-time, which can mean a lower rate of pay women are under-represented in senior roles -this may be due to attitudes about gender roles, lack of flexible working or women taking time to look after their family It also varies widely between different industries and jobs. Assemblers and metal workers see the biggest pay gap, and there\u2019s also a sharp difference for senior roles like financial managers, directors, and CEOs. Brexit is a particular worry to the UK auto industry because components typically cross the channel several times before a car finally rolls off the production line. The Financial Times did a good piece on this last year, pointing out that the bumper for a new Bentley could be made in Europe, checked in Crewe, painted in Germany, and then assembled in Britain. A fuel injector built by US component maker Delphi, used in diesel lorries, takes a similarly long trip.... The FT\u2019s Peter Campbell explained: This part uses steel from Europe which is machined in the UK before going to Germany for special heat treatment. The injector is then assembled at Delphi\u2019s UK plant in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, before being sold on to truckmakers based in Sweden, France or Germany. If the resulting truck is sold into the UK market, the component or materials used in it will have crossed the Channel five times before the lorry is ever driven by the customer. If tariffs are applied at each stage, the cost could be substantial. Getting back to cars, here\u2019s a table showing how Britain\u2019s factories churned out 4% fewer vehicles in September. Barclays CEO Jes Staley won\u2019t enjoy today\u2019s share price fall.... and he won\u2019t get much relief from browsing through today\u2019s analyst notes either. Investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods are particularly cutting, following the drop in Barclay\u2019s investment bank income. Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown agrees that Q3 \u2018wasn\u2019t a pretty quarter\u2019 for Barclays International, adding: Litigation still remains a risk for Barclays, with more than 20 separate investigations ongoing, not least one relating to CEO Jes Staley\u2019s attempt to uncover a whisteblower in his own ranks..... After making some good progress, Barclays appears to be stalling somewhat and it\u2019s now touch and go whether the bank will break even in 2017. With the bank\u2019s restructuring complete, Jes Staley will want to recover some momentum as we move forward into next year.\u2019 Every weekday morning, our Business Today email will deliver the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics, direct to your inbox.

Barclays have fallen by 7%, on track for their worst daily fall since the EU referendum in June 2016. Barclay\u2019s investment bank is going through a bad time - income from trading bonds, foreign exchange and commodities shrank by 14%, partly down to the decline in market volatility. CEO Jes Staley says: The third quarter was clearly a difficult one for our Markets business within Barclays International. A lack of volume and volatility in FICC [Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities] hit Markets revenues hard across the industry, and we were no exception to this trend. Overall, Barclays grew its pre-tax profits by 19% over the last nine months, to \u00a33.44bn. Staley says he has now turned Barclays into a \u201cTransatlantic Consumer and Wholesale Bank\u201d. It\u2019s made up of Barclays UK and Barclays International (mainly the investment bank), following the sale of various international assets including Barclay\u2019s Africa division. The City, though, doesn\u2019t seem impressed.... Today\u2019s drop in UK car production is the fourth blow to the auto industry in recent weeks. We\u2019ve also seen that: Car sales have fallen for six months running, including a 9% drop in September Vauxhall is cutting 400 jobs at its Ellesmere Port plant, after seeing falling demand for the Astra Pendragon, the leading car dealership group, issued a profits warning after suffering a sharp fall in demand and falling prices. Inchcape, the new and used car dealer, has also warned that Britain\u2019s car sector is deteriorating. In its latest financial results, released this morning, it says: UK market slowing, as expected, resulting in continuing margin pressure on vehicles. In other words, we\u2019re buying fewer cars, forcing dealers to cut prices to get a sale. The storm clouds gathering over Britain\u2019s car industry have darkened this morning, after manufacturers suffered a sharp fall in production. Output shrank by 4.1% in September, new figures from the motor industry show. Alarmingly, domestic demand tumbled by 14.2%, while there was also a 1.1% decline in production for exports. In total, 6,500 fewer cars were produced last month than in September 2016. That has helped to drag production during 2017 down by 2.2%: Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says the industry is suffering from falling confidence - and a government clampdown on diesel cars. Hawes says the industry\u2019s big fear is that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, which would disrupt the car industry\u2019s ability to buy and sell cars and components across the channel. \u201cWith UK car manufacturing falling for a fifth month this year, it\u2019s clear that declining consumer and business confidence is affecting domestic demand and hence production volumes. Uncertainty regarding the national air quality plans also didn\u2019t help the domestic market for diesel cars, despite the fact that these new vehicles will face no extra charges or restrictions across theUK. Brexit is the greatest challenge of our times and yet we still don\u2019t have any clarity on what our future relationship with our biggest trading partner will look like, nor detail of the transitional deal being sought. Leaving the EU with no deal would be the worst outcome for our sector so we urge government to deliver on its commitments and safeguard the competitiveness of the industry.\u201d These disappointing figures come a day after Japanese manufacturer Toyota urged the government to raise the \u2018fog\u2019 of Brexit uncertainty. City analyst Simon French of Panmure Gordon points out that car production has gone into reverse in other countries too...... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. All eyes will be on the European Central Bank today, as the eurozone\u2019s top central bankers meet to set monetary policy. And it could be a red letter day, with the ECB likely to turn down the gas on its money-printing programme. With Europe\u2019s economy firing on all cylinders, the ECB is likely to decide to cut the pace of its bond-buying stimulus scheme, which is currently creating \u20ac60bn of new money each month. But, inflation is still below target, so the ECB won\u2019t feel under pressure to slam the brakes. Instead, it will probably cut the pace of quantitative easing...but by how much? No-one\u2019s really sure, so prepare for drama when ECB chief Mario Draghi reveals how he plans to slow, or \u2018taper\u2019, the stimulus plan. Financial group PNC predicts that the ECB will lop \u20ac15bn off its QE programme, and keep buying government and corporate bonds until next autumn. They say: We expect a reduction in monthly asset purchases to perhaps \u20ac45 billion euros in January from the current \u20ac60 billion. The ECB will probably refrain from a firm commitment to an end-date for its program at tomorrow\u2019s decision; we expect purchases to continue until at least the third quarter of 2018. Draghi\u2019s challenge is to avoid alarming the markets, sparking a crash in bond prices or a surge in the euro. Capital Economics say he must strike a delicate balance: Following the numerous signals from President Draghi and colleagues over recent months, the market is well primed for some form of taper announcement. But there is still a delicate balance to strike. Taper too quickly and the markets might worry that the ECB\u2019s historically hawkish instincts \u2013 typified by the premature (and subsequently reversed) interest rate hikes of 2011 \u2013 may be resurfacing. One obvious consequence could be an undesirable rise in the euro. But too tentative a move could fuel concerns that the ECB has little confidence in the economic outlook and the effectiveness of its previous policy measures. European stock markets are expected to rise a little, while traders wait for the ECB\u2019s announcement at lunchtime. Also today.... Barclays Bank and high street retailer Debenhams are reporting results this morning. We also get a new survey of retail spending from the CBI.

      "bodyText": "Chief executives come and go at Barclays but one debate remains the same: can the bank make decent money from investment banking consistently? The question has been asked for 20 years, in which time Barclays has had seven permanent chief executives and two stand-ins. The debate has burned most fiercely since the wild risk-taking of the early and mid-2000s turned out horribly (except for the lucky employees who had bagged their bonuses). Jes Staley, a JP Morgan veteran who has packed Barclays\u2019 senior ranks with fellow ex-Morganites, was supposed to be the boss who would show shareholders the way to healthy returns from investment banking in a world where regulators rightly insist on fatter capital cushions. Staley declared that Barclays\u2019 investment banking unit, after its post-crisis tactical retreats from some activities, would not get any smaller. It would be a core part of the group\u2019s rebirth as a \u201ctransatlantic consumer and wholesale bank\u201d, freed from its continental European retail distractions and its capital-hungry African operations. The clearing of decks has happened, so how\u2019s the investment bank shaping up? Not so well. Nobody expected knock-out numbers because even the big Wall Street houses report sluggish market conditions. Barclays\u2019 figures, however, were even weaker than forecast. Trading income was down 14% after nine months of 2017, with the third quarter being considerably worse. Barclays\u2019 shares fell 7% and now trade at just two-thirds of book value, suggesting investors\u2019 faith is flagging. To try to raise spirits, Staley finally set some hard financial targets for the whole group \u2013 return on equity will be 9%-plus in 2019 and 10%-plus in 2020. Both would be a big advance on the current 5.1%. But, to get there, the investment bank needs to bring in more revenue \u2013 it still accounts for about half of Barclays\u2019 assets. It\u2019s not happening currently. There is, of course, a fair argument that Barclays would be in a messier state without its investment bank: diversification helped the UK retail bank pay all those PPI compensation bills. And there\u2019s little point abandoning Staley\u2019s strategy after only two years if the first prize is meant to arrive in 2019. But, for those who have watched Barclays\u2019 long struggles with its investment bank, a sense of deja vu is already creeping in. Trouble at Deutsche B\u00f6rse What news from Frankfurt, Europe\u2019s next financial hub? Well, the chief executive of Deutsche B\u00f6rse, Germany\u2019s stock exchange, has had to resign amid allegations of insider trading. To put it mildly, that\u2019s not an ideal top line for a come-to-Frankfurt sales pitch. Carsten Kengeter\u2019s position has looked impossible since a German court this week rejected a deal that would have seen him pay \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3443,281) and avoid criminal charges. The Frankfurt prosecutor had said there was \u201ccurrently not sufficient suspicion against the accused\u201d and backed the settlement, but the judge told the prosecutor to keep investigating. A related settlement with Deutsche B\u00f6rse itself, worth \u20ac10.5m, was also thrown out. Kengeter and his soon-to-be former employer deny the allegations, which stem from the chief executive\u2019s purchase of shares worth \u20ac4.5m in December 2015, a few weeks before Deutsche B\u00f6rse said it was in formal merger talks with the London Stock Exchange, an announcement that sent its share price up. Kengeter may yet be exonerated but no detail of the handling of this affair reflects well on Deutsche B\u00f6rse, a pillar of the German financial establishment. The very serious allegations have consumed the company for most of 2017 and September\u2019s ill-fated settlement was designed to allow it to \u201cre-focus as quickly as possible on managing the business and leave behind the serious burdens placed on it by the investigation proceedings\u201d. Now Kengeter has to go anyway and the investigation is back on. Not good, especially when you\u2019re meant to be exploiting the Brexit blizzard to snatch business from London. Incidentally, the two companies\u2019 share prices have travelled at different speeds since the merger talks collapsed at the end of March. Deutsche B\u00f6rse is up 11% but the LSE by 26%. Why can\u2019t BT implement price cut sooner Providing a landline-only service to 1 million people, mostly pensioners who haven\u2019t joined the broadband life, is money for old copper for BT. So it\u2019s only right to applaud regulator Ofcom for insisting that the company cuts its prices for some of its most loyal customers. The monthly cost of line rental for BT\u2019s landline-only punters will fall by \u00a37 a month to \u00a311.99 from April. Why not immediately, though? Apparently it\u2019s because BT needs time to adjust its systems and adapt its IT. Five months of fiddling to change a price? No wonder BT\u2019s roll-out of a fast-fibre network is taking so long.",

      "bodyText": "High street sales are falling at their fastest rate since the height of the recession in 2009 as struggling households put the brakes on spending, according to a survey that is a grim omen for struggling retailers this Christmas. The CBI\u2019s closely watched survey recorded a \u201csteep drop\u201d in retail sales in October. The slump sent shockwaves through the high street, with the CBI\u2019s chief economist, Rain Newton-Smith, warning of a \u201csoftening\u201d of demand as inflation ate into Britons\u2019 spending power. Department stores and specialist food and drink outlets bore the brunt of the spending slowdown. \u201cIt\u2019s clear retailers are beginning to really feel the pinch from higher inflation,\u201d said Newton-Smith. \u201cWhile retail sales can be volatile from month to month, the steep drop in sales in October echoes other recent data pointing to a marked softening in consumer demand.\u201d The bleak snapshot of high street trading provided by the CBI \u2013 which also reported that orders placed with suppliers had dropped at the fastest rate since the spring of 2009 \u2013 came as Asda\u2019s income tracker documented a slump in the spending power of average households. Kay Neufeld, an economist at the Cebr consultancy, which conducted the supermarket study, said: \u201cWe have seen family spending power decline in five out of the last six months, underlining the mounting pressures on households\u2019 budgets.\u201d London was the winner in the race for higher disposable incomes, Neufeld said, after household income in the capital rose by 2.4% compared with a national fall of 0.5%. But in all regions, incomes failed to rise by more than the current inflation rate of 3%. The findings chimed with official figures for the year to April 2017 that showed London\u2019s income growth outstripping other regions, although the biggest gains were in inner London boroughs. Wages in outer London suburbs increased by 1.2%, compared with 4.4% in the centre of the city, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. The east Midlands and East Anglia were the only other regions where wages increased by more than the inflation rate in April, which stood at 2.6%. Further evidence of an income squeeze was provided by new research from Lloyds Bank, which found that women and families across the UK were \u201cfeeling the strain\u201d of rising living costs. Based on a sample of its current account data, Lloyds said consumers\u2019 essential spend \u2013 a figure that includes rent, bills, food and fuel costs \u2013 had increased by 2% in September versus a year ago. This was the 16th consecutive month of year-on-year growth. \u201cWhen paying more for everyday items like food and fuel, people are faced with tricky decisions on where to cut back in other areas,\u201d said Robin Bulloch, the managing director of Lloyds Bank, who said there was evidence of Britons staying away from the shops to avoid impulse purchases and cutting down on nights out. Almost two-thirds of the 2,000 people polled by Lloyds felt worried about current levels of inflation. The research found 56% of women felt under pressure to reduce their spending, compared with 47% of men. Families in particular were feeling the pinch, according to the survey, with 60% of those with children saying they felt under pressure to cut back, versus just 47% of those without children. The CBI said 50% of retailers polled for its survey suffered declining sales in October, while only 15% benefited from an increase, leaving a rounded balance of -36%, the lowest since March 2009. The CBI survey adds to the mixed economic signals to be considered by the Bank of England next week when it decides whether to increase interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. A rise could help keep inflation in check and strengthen the pound, but household borrowing costs would also grow. Uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations has also preyed on consumer confidence, which has declined sharply over the past 18 months and depressed spending. Figures estimating GDP growth in the third quarter showed the services sector holding up despite recent declines in wages adjusted for inflation. However, the retail sector recorded its slowest rate of growth in four years. Christmas has already begun on the high street, with novelty jumpers, crackers and mince pies decking the aisles. Many chains bank the lion\u2019s share of annual profits in November and December, and retail bosses are battling for business after a tough year in which the weakness of sterling pushed up the cost of importing goods, squeezing profit margins. On Thursday, Debenhams said the pattern of trading was \u201cvolatile\u201d as it reported a 44% dive in profits. The department store confirmed the closure of two stores, in Eltham, south London, and Farnborough, Hampshire, affecting about 80 jobs. They are the first of up to 10 UK branches that Debenhams has earmarked for closure. Retailers are all trimming back their high street presence as shoppers shift from flicking through the rails in stores to perusing their phones and tablet computers at home or on the bus. The likes of Marks &amp; Spencer, Mothercare and all the major supermarkets have closed stores while investing in their online operations. The retail sector employs around 3 million people, but store groups are slashing jobs and working hours as shoppers batten down the hatches and sales move online. There was a \u201crecord\u201d reduction in retail jobs in the last quarter, according to the British Retail Consortium, with the number of hours worked in retail down by 4.2% and the total number of store workers falling by 3%.",

Department stores and specialist food and drink outlets bore the brunt of the spending slowdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear retailers are beginning to really feel the pinch from higher inflation,\u201d said Newton-Smith. \u201cWhile retail sales can be volatile from month to month, the steep drop in sales in October echoes other recent data pointing to a marked softening in consumer demand.\u201d</p> \n<p>The bleak snapshot of high street trading provided by the CBI \u2013 which also reported that orders placed with suppliers had dropped at the fastest rate since the spring of 2009 \u2013 came as Asda\u2019s income tracker documented a slump in the spending power of average households.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kay Neufeld, an economist at the Cebr consultancy, which conducted the supermarket study, said: \u201cWe have seen family spending power decline in five out of the last six months, underlining the mounting pressures on households\u2019 budgets.\u201d</p> \n<p>London was the winner in the race for higher disposable incomes, Neufeld said, after household income in the capital rose by 2.4% compared with a national fall of 0.5%. But in all regions, incomes failed to rise by more than the current inflation rate of 3%.</p> \n<p>The findings chimed with official figures for the year to April 2017 that showed London\u2019s income growth outstripping other regions, although the biggest gains were in inner London boroughs. Wages in outer London suburbs increased by 1.2%, compared with 4.4% in the centre of the city, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.</p> \n<p>The east Midlands and East Anglia were the only other regions where wages increased by more than the inflation rate in April, which stood at 2.6%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a4c82a7-3e7d-44a8-8d40-18e25102ff4f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Inflation is when prices rise.

The research found 56% of women felt under pressure to reduce their spending, compared with 47% of men.

      "bodyText": "The boss of Barclays has been forced to defend his strategy amid falling profits at the investment banking arm and a tumbling share price. Jes Staley, who is under investigation by City regulators over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower, said at a briefing on the third-quarter results on Thursday that his two-year restructuring of the bank was now complete and he could focus on generating returns to shareholders. Investors were not convinced, with the share price falling more than 7% \u2013 the biggest one-day drop since the vote for Brexit in June 2016 \u2013 even though the bank reported a 19% rise in nine-month profits to \u00a33.4bn. The focus centred on the 15% fall in profits at Barclays\u2019 international arm \u2013 primarily its investment bank. This was driven by lower profits at the bank\u2019s markets business, which trades foreign exchange, bonds and currencies. \u201cThe third quarter was clearly a difficult one for our markets business \u2026 A lack of volatility in [foreign exchange, bonds and currencies] hit markets revenues hard across the industry and we were no exception to this trend,\u201d Staley said. The bank has reduced the amount set aside for bonuses in the third quarter of the year by 25%. Bankers receive their payouts after the full year. Staley, an American banker who took the top job in December 2015, gave no update on the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority, the Bank of England and US regulators into attempts to unmask a whistleblower who made allegations about a long-term associate of Staley that he had brought to work at the bank. Staley told investors the bank\u2019s dividend would be reviewed with the full-year results in February. He cut the payout to investors for two years while he implemented his restructuring plan to sell off its African arm and its retail banking outside the UK, which has led to a 60,000-strong fall in headcount during his tenure. \u201cThe third quarter of 2017 was particularly significant for Barclays as it was the first for many years in which we have not been in some state of restructuing,\u201d said Staley. Analysts were not convinced. \u201cBarclays investors have already endured a torrid time in 2017, and today\u2019s [statement] offers no relief at all,\u201d said Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec. \u201cWhilst we have been a seller this year, we had thought Barclays would struggle to disappoint [on] low Q3 expectations. It looks like they have succeeded,\u201d analysts at brokers KBW said. The bank, which owns the UK\u2019s biggest credit card company, Barclaycard, has been charged with fraud by the Serious Fraud Office over the way it raised cash during the financial crisis. It is also fighting charges by the Department of Justice in the US over the way it sold mortgage bonds a decade ago. There were no updates on either of these inquiries but the bank announced it had settled a long-running case with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for $105m (\u00a380m). It could have faced a bill of at least $470m for allegedly manipulating power prices in California between 2006 and 2008. Staley said: \u201cWhilstworking to put our remaining conduct issues behind us, we remain focused as a management team, on being in a position to distribute the returns that these plan will generate ... to shareholders.\u201d On his first day at Barclays, Staley bought 2.8m shares at 233p each. Just before he was recruited, the bank\u2019s chairman, John McFarlane, had pledged to double the share price when it was trading at 260p. The shares are now trading at 183p \u2013 below the value of the bank\u2019s assets, which are worth around 280p a share. Staley said on Thursday that his aim was to generate enough profits to propel the banks share price above that.",

      "bodyText": "BT is to slash the amount it charges a million landline-only customers by more than a third, saving them \u00a384 a year, after Ofcom criticised telecom providers for overcharging those - mostly the elderly - who do not have broadband or TV packages. The company will slash the monthly cost of line rental for its landline-only customers by \u00a37 a month to \u00a311.99 from April next year, following a scathing review by the regulator, which highlighted the \u201cpoor value\u201d for money subscribers get compared with those who buy bundles including TV and broadband. Ofcom said it stepped in because bills for landline-only customers \u2013 nearly two-thirds of whom are over 65 \u2013 have \u201csoared\u201d in recent years despite BT and other landline providers benefiting from significant cuts in the cost of providing the service. \u201cFor many people, their landline is their lifeline,\u201d said Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom\u2019s competition group director. \u201cBut households who only have a landline \u2013 and no broadband \u2013 have seen their phone bills soar. Many are elderly, and have been with BT for decades. We\u2019ve been clear that they must get a better deal.\u201d Ofcom has focused on BT because it accounts for two-thirds of the UK\u2019s 1.5m landline-only customers, but it expects rivals who similarly overcharge their customers to follow suit. \u201cThis position [of dominance] has allowed BT to increase prices without much risk of losing customers, and other providers have followed BT\u2019s pricing lead,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cWe expect BT\u2019s \u00a37 price cut to mean other providers can follow suit.\u201d Ofcom said that over three-quarters of BT\u2019s landline-only customers have never switched provider, which has left them a prime target for price rises. The regulator said that all major landline providers have increased their line rental charges by between 23% and 47% in recent years, while their own costs for providing the service have fallen about 27%. Ofcom said it is also looking at measures to help people shop around for better deals with more confidence. \u201cWe will continue to keep a close eye on the market, to ensure BT\u2019s actions address the problems we have identified,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cIf we have any concerns about consumers or competition, we will consider the need for further intervention.\u201d The price cut, which will automatically be appiled to the accounts of 800,000 BT customers, will apply for three years from April. A further 200,000 customers on BT\u2019s \u201cHome Phone Saver\u201d package will also be eligible but will have to apply. \u201cWe welcome a balanced voluntary agreement with Ofcom,\u201d said BT. \u201cWe have listened to the concerns of our line-only customers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chairman of Crown Resorts, James Packer, has been questioned by anti-pokies activists at the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Melbourne, conceding that more transparency around gambling revenue and harms may be required. Alliance for Gambling Reform representatives Tim Costello and Stephen Mayne pressed Packer and the board on Thursday morning about issues including political donations and secrecy surrounding poker machine losses and revenue. Board members were also confronted by former poker machine addict Anna Bardsley, the first time someone with experience of problem gambling has questioned Crown executives during an AGM. While Packer did not commit to more transparency, he said the board would take a \u201cserious look and talk about it\u201d. But he also added the board may not ultimately give anti-gambling advocates \u201ceverything that you require\u201d. \u201cCompanies need to be more transparent than they were 10 years ago,\u201d Packer said. \u201cFrom my perspective it is a conversation that the board should have because we are living in a world of more and more transparency.\u201d Packer also appeared to suggest Crown Resorts would move away from large political donations, though he did not say the donations would stop. Crown Resorts executive chairman John Alexander also addressed shareholders, angrily refuting allegations made under parliamentary privilege last week by independent Tasmania MP Andrew Wilkie. Wilkie alleged Crown tampered with machines to change the odds, allowed other people\u2019s identity cards to be used to process cash transactions and turned a blind eye to drug use and family violence. \u201cI am angered and disappointed by the outrageous and unfounded allegations levelled at us by Mr Wilkie, which unfairly smeared Crown by asserting that we have acted improperly in relation to our gaming machines and operations,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cWe also do not improperly manipulate our gaming machines. Any employee found breaching our codes and practices would face severe disciplinary consequences. Mr Wilkie\u2019s inferences and commentary are deeply offensive to Crown, our board of directors and our employees.\u201d Guardian Australia attempted to attend the AGM, which was open to journalists, but was refused entry by security. The media officer appointed by Crown to the AGM also refused to respond to calls and emails. Mayne said it was another example of the lack of transparency from Crown Resorts, which unlike other major companies does not webcast its AGM nor provide transcripts or meeting minutes to shareholders and journalists. Journalists have previously criticised the treatment of media at Crown Resorts AGMs, including being made to stand in a roped-off area. \u201cThe idea that mainstream journalists were not able to gain access shows the bunker mentality at Crown,\u201d Mayne said. \u201cCrown are on the back-foot politically and they need to be seen as being more transparent or there will be a backlash from the public. The very first test of whether they are truly considering increasing transparency will be seeing if they release a full transcript of today\u2019s meeting.\u201d Packer refused to take questions from journalists prior to or after the meeting. During the meeting Packer was re-elected to the Crown Resorts board by investors almost unanimously. He was also pressed about the company\u2019s retreat from Asia. Crown staff including executives were arrested and jailed in China last year for \u201cgambling crimes\u201d. It is not uncommon for casinos to send their staff to China, where gambling is mostly illegal, in order to lure them to casinos overseas including in Australia. In May, Crown announced it would sell its assets in Macau. \u201cSixteen staff were put in jail last year and Crown takes the welfare of its employees very seriously, very, very seriously and that forced the Crown directors\u2019 hands in relation to Macau,\u201d Packer told shareholders. Shareholders were told that VIP program play turnover at Australian Crown resorts had fallen 17% in the past year, which Alexander described as \u201cencouraging given that most of the prior corresponding period preceded the detention of Crown\u2019s staff in China.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s corporate regulator has revealed it could pursue criminal charges against Rio Tinto executives after the company failed to promptly tell shareholders about a multi-billion dollar write-down of a coal asset in Mozambique. Greg Medcraft, the chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), was asked a series of questions in Senate estimates on Thursday about Rio Tinto\u2019s disastrous $4bn purchase of Riversdale Mining Company in Mozambique in 2011. Rio Tinto purchased the company while Tom Albanese was chief executive, and Guy Elliot was chief financial officer. The mining giant has already been fined \u00a327.4m in the UK after being accused of overstating the value of the coal project. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan, alleging Rio Tinto, Albanese and Elliot failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record the African coal asset. The SEC has claimed that within months of the 2011 purchase, Rio\u2019s internal modelling found the value of Riversdale was between negative $3.45bn and negative $9bn, rather than $4bn, and Albanese and Elliot did not immediately tell shareholders about the write-down. It has alleged as the project began to suffer setbacks, resulting in the rapid decline of the value of the coal assets, Albanese and Elliott sought to hide or delay disclosure of the nature and extent of the adverse developments from Rio Tinto\u2019s board of directors, auditors and investors. Medcraft told senators on Thursday that Asic officials had been working with the SEC \u201cfrom day one\u201d on the case, and it still had a long way to go with the investigation. \u201cWe\u2019re not finished yet,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I always say it\u2019s a journey; the journey hasn\u2019t finished yet.\u201d The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, an economist who has worked on Wall Street, wanted to know if Asic would bring its own charges against Rio Tinto executives, given that Rio was a dual-listed company in Australia and the UK, and Asic hadn\u2019t launched legal action yet. Medcraft replied: \u201cWe could. Correct. Watch this space.\u201d John Price, Asic commissioner, then told senators that Asic\u2019s investigation was \u201cwell progressed\u201d and \u201call enforcement options are on the table.\u201d Guardian Australia understands that to mean that civil and criminal proceedings, against both individuals and the company, could be on the horizon. Medcraft said Asic had had discussions with the SEC about the US regulator taking the lead in the investigation because it had a higher penalty regime and more resources. He said regulators in the UK could also take action against Rio Tinto by administrative decision, without going through the courts, to financially penalise the company. Price said it was also noteworthy that news reports had mentioned the role of a whistleblower in the US, and Asic was keeping an eye on the whistleblower debate in Australia. Medcraft said: \u201cSo basically it\u2019s one of those cases, think globally act locally, and try to get the best outcome on an overall basis.\u201d",
