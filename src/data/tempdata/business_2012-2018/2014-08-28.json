The big driver of building construction was residential buildings, up by 9.9%, the biggest annual rise since the stimulus measures during the GFC saw residential building construction rise 13.3% in the 12 months to September 2010. But while this would suggest growth in building construction is cancelling out the decline in engineering construction, engineering construction is worth about $30bn, compared with $22bn for buildings, so there was an overall decline in construction of 1.5%. When we break it down by states, we see the real impact of the mining boom\u2019s end. Annual growth of construction in the mining states of WA, QLD and the Northern Territory fell 3.1% on the past year, compared with growth of 0.5% in the other states. Prior to the most recent boom in 2010, the largest share of national construction occurred in the non-mining states; now, about $5bn more construction each quarter is in the mining states. But if the decline in mining capital investment continues, this may be reversed. The drop in capital investment was partially picked up by the boom in mining exports. March GDP figures show exports grew by 10% and the mining industry contributed a pretty sizeable 1.1 percentage points to annual GDP growth \u2013 almost double the 0.6 percentage points contribution of the finance and insurance industry. But for the GDP figures expected next week, export growth seems to have come off the boil.

And if it doesn\u2019t, the worry is whether the non-mining industries be able to take up the slack. What we do know is the big impact the mining boom had on Australia\u2019s economy. On Monday, the RBA published a research paper which found that the mining boom from 2002 onwards added 13% to real per capita household disposable income. Part of this increase was through the increased prices we received for our exports and the relative decline in prices we paid for our imports. This higher \u201cpurchasing power\u201d boosted our consumption of cars (30% higher than it would have been), household durables \u2013 such as whitegoods (25%), food (20%) and communications (8%). The report also suggests that, without the mining boom, Australia\u2019s unemployment rate would have risen by about 0.75 more percentage points during the GFC, and in 2013 unemployment would have risen to about 6.7% rather than averaging 5.5%. The report suggests manufacturing output in 2013 was 5% lower than it would have been without the mining boom.

      "bodyText": "It is June 2029, and the last train run by a private company rolls into platform 28 of the new Euston mega-station. The moment is marked only by a low-key ceremony with a handful of managers and long-retired staff, since few in the railways want to reignite the long-bubbling political row over what only the oldest members of the House of Lords still call \"a return to the bad old days of British Rail\". Yet, as Labour ministers are fond of pointing out, the first moment in the long wave of renationalisations started back in September 2014 \u2013 the final months of the Cameron government \u2013 when Network Rail came back under state control. Or did it? The semantics and equivocation over Network Rail's status already resembles a saga to equal Boris Johnson on his ambitions. The government insists its impending reclassification is a \"statistical decision\" \u2013 not (dread word) nationalisation. Network Rail is more relaxed over what people choose to call it. The fact is that from Monday, the track operator moves from being nominally in the private sector to a public sector organisation, answerable to parliament and with a ballooning \u00a334bn debt now on the national balance sheet. Claims that ministers are seizing control are dismissed by both Network Rail and the coalition. Yet on Friday Network Rail's 41 public members \u2013 to whom the board is theoretically accountable \u2013 vote on allowing the secretary of state to hire and fire the chair of the track operator, have a greater say over the board and in effect control the appointment of those public members. One member, Lord Berkeley, who chairs the Rail Freight Group, says: \"I think it's a very big deal. A special member will appoint a special director and will fix the director's bonuses, executive pay and approve strategies. If that isn't state control, what is?\" At the transport department, the official line holds firm. A spokesman says: \"The classification of Network Rail is an independent statistical decision by the Office of National Statistics. It does not change the industry structure or affect the day-to-day operations of the rail network. The ONS's decision has no effect on fares, performance, punctuality, safety or timetables.\" At Network Rail, as befits an organisation the government wants to insist is at arm's length, the official word is slightly different: \"For passengers and station users, this statistical change will mean little to their journeys. We recognise that, for Network Rail, it will mean greater accountability and transparency to parliament, taxpayers and fare payers, who rightly deserve to better understand the value of their significant investment in Britain's booming railway.\" For all they play down its significance, the reclassification is something both parties have struggled to avoid. One adviser to the last government recalls annual edicts from the Treasury warning the transport secretary that, however desperately they might wish to condemn Network Rail directors' bonuses, any hint of exercising direct political control would lead to the ONS calling out the taxpayer-funded track operator as a public body \u2013 and keeping its ever-increasing borrowing off the public balance sheet \u2013 was a concern well before the 2010 election made government debt a defining issue. Hence, later, the tortuous solution employed by the then transport secretary, Justine Greening, in the face of bonus uproar in 2012: she said that as an ordinary public member of Network Rail, she would vote against the awards, rather than demanding action as a minister. On the railway side, one well placed Network Rail source admits: \"The fear is that there will be real scrutiny of spending.\" He compares current arrangements to how franchising has helped investment in the railway: the befuddling flow of finance might mask who ultimately pays, but bids to run train lines that come with promises or conditions of upgraded stations, rolling stock and facilities come at one more remove from the Treasury \u2013 potentially giving first the DfT and the rail industry a greater degree of effective public spending than it might have if the competing claims of wifi on trains or a new hospital were directly linked. The \u00a338.5bn core budget for the next five years is approved and the government insists there are no plans to curb investment. But those fears have escalated since a summer row between chief executive Mark Carne and an unsuspecting Patrick McLoughlin, transport secretary, over an additional \u00a31.5bn needed for electrification projects, which has resulted, one source claims, in \"armies of civil servants crawling over the budget\" even before the track operator officially doffs its cap to McLoughlin. Until now, the answer would have been for Network Rail to simply borrow: its spending on the never-never has largely escaped public attention, despite the industry jocularly speaking of the \"Network Rail credit card\". That card continually accrues debt \u2013 with minimal repayments \u2013 by borrowing against its regulated asset base or the railways' overall value as bigger stations are built and new track laid. It is a bit like someone constantly drawing down cash against their house, spending it on improvements and borrowing yet more on the basis that it could be sold for more, should someone fancy purchasing a 17-room mansion with an ugly side-return and triple-glazed conservatory. Meanwhile the mortgage is never paid down. As Roger Ford, editor of Modern Railways, puts it: \"When government authorises an enhancement \u2013 say the Midland main line electrification \u2013 it does so on the basis that Network Rail will borrow to pay for the work and that taxpayers yet unborn will stump up through the RAB mechanism to pay the interest on those loans.\" The rail regulator, ORR, last year gently suggested that the government might like to have a peek at Network Rail's funding mechanisms as it forecast the debt to pass \u00a350bn by the end of the decade. But, says Daniel Brown, director of strategy and policy at ORR: \"It's not a significant amount against the whole of public debt.\" He believes the reclassification is a positive move: \"This will enhance transparency and accountability. They will now borrow money through the Treasury rather than from the City \u2013 it's slightly cheaper.\" Others are more sceptical, especially as the track operator appears likely to be excluded from Freedom of Information (FoI) legislation. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA transport workers' union, which is campaigning to ensure FoI applies, says it will mean \"a public sector firm, carrying a \u00a330bn debt mountain and with a five-year spending budget of \u00a338bn, being removed from financial scrutiny by the very people who are paying all these vast bills \u2013 the UK taxpayers.\" Despite insistence all round that it is business as usual, the row highlights that the move is politically unpredictable. Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, says: \"I do think it will give government a lot more opportunity to interfere \u2013 for good or ill \u2013 than before. There is some scepticism within government that Network Rail is as efficient as it should be. I'm sure there will be pressure on them to address that.\" He points to changes in personnel at the DfT to \"manage the relationship\", with a new rail executive established: \"In the short term things won't much change, but in the longer term there is potential for a lot more to change, whoever wins the election.\"",

The restart of negotiations with debt-burdened Greece\u2019s creditors is being seen as a turning point on which much now hangs.<br></p> <p>Although devoid of the drama that has engulfed so many of Athens\u2019 interactions with those keeping it afloat, officials are calling the talks a potential bifurcation in the road: if the right path is followed, it could pave the way to the country finally exiting years of excruciating outside supervision. That, in turn, will lighten the weight on a government in power with a wafer thin majority as it enters a potentially politically turbulent fall. </p> <p>\u201cThe nation must start the process of exiting the crisis [so that] everyone understands that we are going into a new phase,\u201d said the coalition government\u2019s deputy leader, Evangelos Venizelos, emerging from talks overseen by prime minister Antonis Samaras that were aimed solely at coordinating strategy late Wednesday. </p> <p>But while carefully choreographed \u2013 for the first time the negotiations will take place outside the borders of Greece \u2013 the Paris talks are also full of potential pitfalls. In his back-to-back meetings today, Hardouvelis, an academic known for his pragmatic approach, focused on foreclosures (<em>long demanded by the troika</em>) and other neuralgic points in discussions with the justice and other ministers who will also be travelling to the French capital. Greek courts, in particular, have thrown a wrench into progress by declaring several of the troika\u2019s mandated reforms to be \u201cillegal and unconstitutional.\u201d</p> <p>One well-placed source said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt is absolutely critical that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet,\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWe have to work as a group.

With the radical left main opposition Syriza party making taxes it\u2019s new line of attack, the government says more than ever it is vital it is cut some slack. The projected fiscal gap, bank liquidity and \u2018red loans,\u2019 an ever-burgeoning problem, will be among the other points of contention.</p> <p>With Greeks numbed but no less angst by the crisis \u2013 by far the country\u2019s worst in modern times \u2013 all know the future is fragile. Summing up the mood ahead of the talks earlier today, Panos Skourletis, Syriza\u2019s spokesman felt fit to describe the negotiations as \u201cthe last tango in Paris.\u201d \u201cWe are living through the last days of this government,\u201d he said, accusing Samaras of being far removed from the reality of ordinary Greeks hit by relentless cuts and tax hikes. </p> <p>Skourletis added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s not because we are in a hurry to take over government positions but because the problems surpassed the red mark long ago.

It is hard to judge whether this is a truly new development, given the evidence of Russia\u2019s military involvement that had already accumulated over many weeks. However, pro-Russia separatists have now taken control of the coastal town of Novoazovsk and are reportedly ready to move on the strategic port city of Mariupol. It is quite plausible (based on what happened in Crimea) that Russia might want to take advantage of these advances and annex more territory from Ukraine, or at least to strengthen its support for the rebels.</p> <p>The responses in the markets certainly followed the familiar pattern: renewed weakness in equities, notably in the euro-zone and emerging Europe, and renewed gains for safe havens, notably US Treasuries and German Bunds (with the 10-year yields on the latter setting new lows).</p> <p>Some of the sharpest market falls have, understandably, been in Russia itself, where hopes that a diplomatic solution to the crisis might be found had triggered a rally in the stock market in the early part of this month. But the latest events suggest that things are likely to get worse before they get better. In these circumstances, we expect both Russian equities and the ruble to remain weak over the rest of this year.</p> <p>More reassuringly for others, the price of oil has barely budged and remains near multi-month lows, reflecting ample global supply and weak seasonal demand.

The alternative gross domestic income (GDI) measure suggests that the economy was even stronger in the second quarter, growing by 4.7%. What\u2019s more, the upward revision to the growth of real personal disposable income (4.2% vs. 3.8%) bodes well for consumption growth in the second half of the year.</p> <p>Of course, more important is the recent widespread strengthening in the business and consumer surveys, which suggests that GDP growth in the third quarter could be a decent 3.0%. So although the weak first quarter means that GDP growth this year as a whole is still likely to be around 2.0%, a strong second half of the year sets things up nicely for growth of 3.0% next year.</p> </blockquote> <p>The rise in corporate profits is also encouraging; Hales points out that domestic earnings outperformed profits overseas.

A brisk closing summary: European stock markets have fallen as the news that Russian troops have crossed the Ukranian border pushed the crisis into a new phase. The wobble began after the Ukranian president cancelled a trip to Turkey. Analysts reckon the developments could push down shares in the days ahead - Capital Economics says \u2018batten down the hatches\u2019 . The dash for safe haven assets pushed German bond yields into new record lows. The IMF warned that Ukraine\u2019s aid package may need to be renegotiated. The US economy\u2019s growth rate in the last quarter has been revised up to a 4.2% annual rate, showing that its recovery is stronger than thought. Economists say it bodes well for growth prospects in the rest of the year, as consumer spending and business investment both improved. Prospects of the European Central Bank announcing new stimulus measures next week have receded, after Germany\u2019s inflation rate came in at 0.8% this month. Spain fell deeper into deflation, with prices down 0.5% year-on-year. Germany\u2019s unemployment total rose this month. And confidence in the eurozone has hit an eight month low, dragged down by worries over geopolitical threats such as Ukraine-Russia. Emmanual Macron, France\u2019s new economy minister caused a stir by suggesting in a newspaper interview that the country\u2019s 35-hour working week could be abolished. The government has insisted there are no plans, after unions said the idea would not be acceptable. And in Athens, Greece\u2019s government has been holding talks ahead of next week\u2019s meeting with the troika, and hopes for a breakthrough in relations with its lenders. Tomorrow we get the latest Eurozone inflation data, which could show another fall to just 0.3%. There\u2019s new unemployment data too. Cheers, and goodnight. GW Another sign that the financial markets are in a weird state. The Eonia rate -- the rate at which eurozone banks charge to lend to each other - has turned negative tonight. It\u2019s only just negative \u2013 banks were prepared to pay 0.004% for the opportunity to lend to a rival. But it shows the weak demand for loans in the eurozone; banks are happier to lose a little by lending to each other until tomorrow, rather than committing the capital into real economy. Over to Greece.... where the finance minister is frantically coordinating preparations ahead of potentially make-or- break negotiations between the indebted country and its \u201ctroika\u201d of foreign lenders next week in Paris. From Athens our correspondent, Helena Smith reports. The flurry of meetings that the Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis has been conducting in his sixth floor office overlooking Syntagma square is testament to the sheer significance Athens is giving to next week\u2019s talks. The restart of negotiations with debt-burdened Greece\u2019s creditors is being seen as a turning point on which much now hangs. Although devoid of the drama that has engulfed so many of Athens\u2019 interactions with those keeping it afloat, officials are calling the talks a potential bifurcation in the road: if the right path is followed, it could pave the way to the country finally exiting years of excruciating outside supervision. That, in turn, will lighten the weight on a government in power with a wafer thin majority as it enters a potentially politically turbulent fall. \u201cThe nation must start the process of exiting the crisis [so that] everyone understands that we are going into a new phase,\u201d said the coalition government\u2019s deputy leader, Evangelos Venizelos, emerging from talks overseen by prime minister Antonis Samaras that were aimed solely at coordinating strategy late Wednesday. But while carefully choreographed \u2013 for the first time the negotiations will take place outside the borders of Greece \u2013 the Paris talks are also full of potential pitfalls. In his back-to-back meetings today, Hardouvelis, an academic known for his pragmatic approach, focused on foreclosures (long demanded by the troika) and other neuralgic points in discussions with the justice and other ministers who will also be travelling to the French capital. Greek courts, in particular, have thrown a wrench into progress by declaring several of the troika\u2019s mandated reforms to be \u201cillegal and unconstitutional.\u201d One well-placed source said: \u201cIt is absolutely critical that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet,\u201d \u201cWe have to work as a group. There can be no loose ends.\u201d Greek officials hope that in a neutral setting, mission chiefs representing the EU, ECB and IMF will be able to review Greece\u2019s fiscal adjustment programme \u201cwith fresh eyes\u201d before they return to the capital to complete their review later in the month. Another insider added: \u201cThere won\u2019t be political tension or demonstrations in the streets. The atmosphere will be lighter,\u201d \u201cIt could be a fresh start.\u201d Hardouvelis, who has not been shy of criticizing the troika in the past, hopes to make headway on the thorny issues of taxation (levies slapped on Greeks since the crisis broke out that he believes to be counter-productive and excessively high) and debt relief. With the radical left main opposition Syriza party making taxes it\u2019s new line of attack, the government says more than ever it is vital it is cut some slack. The projected fiscal gap, bank liquidity and \u2018red loans,\u2019 an ever-burgeoning problem, will be among the other points of contention. With Greeks numbed but no less angst by the crisis \u2013 by far the country\u2019s worst in modern times \u2013 all know the future is fragile. Summing up the mood ahead of the talks earlier today, Panos Skourletis, Syriza\u2019s spokesman felt fit to describe the negotiations as \u201cthe last tango in Paris.\u201d \u201cWe are living through the last days of this government,\u201d he said, accusing Samaras of being far removed from the reality of ordinary Greeks hit by relentless cuts and tax hikes. Skourletis added: \u201cAnd that\u2019s not because we are in a hurry to take over government positions but because the problems surpassed the red mark long ago. On all levels the situation is at a point when it can go no further. We see no prospect of exit from the crisis.\u201d European stock markets have closed with losses across the board, as reports of Russian troops fighting within Ukraine raised fears that the crisis would escalate further. German\u2019s DAX fell 1.1%, the French CAC lost 0.6% and the FTSE 100 lost 0.3%, while the Moscow market was worst hit, finishing down 1.7%. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says this morning\u2019s eurozone data added to the gloom: Shares in Europe started on the back foot and never got the chance to take a step forward today after weak German inflation and unemployment data was made all the more worrisome by the prospective of no extra stimulus from the ECB in its upcoming meeting. Downside momentum accelerated for stocks when Ukrainian President Poroshenko said that 15,000 Russian soldiers have been deployed into the Donetsk region in the east of the country. A Russian \u2018incursion\u2019 into Ukraine significantly dents the idea of a de-escalation after the presidential talks yesterday. Here\u2019s how all the main European markets closed, with Egypt the only riser: A reminder of why today\u2019s US growth figures were encouraging: Today\u2019s the day when the Ukraine crisis \u201creturned to bite the markets again\u201d, says Julian Jessop of Capital Economics. He writes: The crisis in Ukraine returned to bite the markets again on Thursday, as President Poroshenko cancelled a visit to Turkey citing \u201cRussian troop deployments\u201d in the east of the country. It is hard to judge whether this is a truly new development, given the evidence of Russia\u2019s military involvement that had already accumulated over many weeks. However, pro-Russia separatists have now taken control of the coastal town of Novoazovsk and are reportedly ready to move on the strategic port city of Mariupol. It is quite plausible (based on what happened in Crimea) that Russia might want to take advantage of these advances and annex more territory from Ukraine, or at least to strengthen its support for the rebels. The responses in the markets certainly followed the familiar pattern: renewed weakness in equities, notably in the euro-zone and emerging Europe, and renewed gains for safe havens, notably US Treasuries and German Bunds (with the 10-year yields on the latter setting new lows). Some of the sharpest market falls have, understandably, been in Russia itself, where hopes that a diplomatic solution to the crisis might be found had triggered a rally in the stock market in the early part of this month. But the latest events suggest that things are likely to get worse before they get better. In these circumstances, we expect both Russian equities and the ruble to remain weak over the rest of this year. More reassuringly for others, the price of oil has barely budged and remains near multi-month lows, reflecting ample global supply and weak seasonal demand. But we suspect that fears of disruption to supplies of Russian natural gas via the Ukraine will gain traction in the coming days. Of course, all this could blow over quickly as both sides pull back from the brink. But for now it may be time for the markets to batten down the hatches again, especially ahead of the long weekend in the US (Monday is Labor Day). This week\u2019s copy of the Economist puts the boot into Europe\u2019s leaders for their failure to steer HMS Eurozone into calmer waters, leaving First Mate Draghi to keep bailing them out again: This handy chart from Sky shows the two separate points where fighting is taking place around the Russia-Ukraine border. The International Monetary Fund has warned that its aid package for Ukraine may need to be \u2018recalibrated\u2019 if the situation deteriorates. Gerry Rice, the director of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s communications, told reporters at a regular press briefing that: If the situation was exacerbated, the programme would have to be significantly recalibrated, including the financing. The degree of uncertainty is large. The IMF agreed a $17bn aid package for Ukraine in April. Rice also answered questions on the news yesterday that IMF chief Christine Lagarde is being been formally investigated for alleged negligence by French magistrates. He said the IMF board will meet \u201cvery soon\u201d to discuss the issue: \u201cThis has been a process over more than three years. The board has been briefed on a number of occasions. The managing director has returned to work. We do anticipate there will be another briefing of the board very soon.\u201d Rice pointed to Lagarde\u2019s own statement yesterday, in which she insisted the allegations were \u201cwithout merit\u201d : \u201cI can\u2019t give you a sense of the board\u2019s feelings about this. That is something they will discuss when they have their briefing. The board has been briefed on a number of occasions, including this year. On each of those occasions, they have expressed confidence in the ability of the managing director to effectively carry out her duties. We are completely focused on serving our membership as best as we can.\u201d \u201cThere are no charges that have been made against the managing director. There is an allegation. I would refer you to the managing director\u2019s statement. [She believes] it is without merit. An appeal has been launched, and she has no intention to resign.\u201d On the IMF board meeting over the matter, Rice added: \u201cI don\u2019t have a date but it\u2019s clearly going to be soon, as soon as possible. The managing director returned to work today, it takes a little time to set up a board meeting. We will keep you posted about what is happening.\u201d (with thanks to my colleague Angela Monaghan) Reuters\u2019 weekly poll of City economists has found that they expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates before the Federal Reserve. A majority of economists surveyed reckon the first UK rate hike will come in the first quarter of 2015, with the Fed following sometime in the second quarter. Another piece of good news from America -- the Pending Home Sales index (measuring how many people have signed contracts to buy a house), has hit its highest level in almost a year. It rose n 3.3% in July to its highest point since last August, suggesting the US housing market is picking up. Barclays analysts also predict decent US growth for the rest of this year, as America puts the bad weather last winter behind it: The strong US growth figures isn\u2019t stopping shares from falling on Wall Street in early trading. The Dow Jones has dropped by nearly 100 points, or 0.6%, to 17022, as New York traders show their concern over reports of Russian troops making incursions into Ukraine (see details here) These new GDP figures are a good sign for the US economy this year, says Paul Hales of Capital Economics: He reckons that it could suggest decent growth in the current quarter: The upward revision was due to faster business investment growth and a smaller drag from net trade more than offsetting smaller positive contributions from inventories and government spending. The alternative gross domestic income (GDI) measure suggests that the economy was even stronger in the second quarter, growing by 4.7%. What\u2019s more, the upward revision to the growth of real personal disposable income (4.2% vs. 3.8%) bodes well for consumption growth in the second half of the year. Of course, more important is the recent widespread strengthening in the business and consumer surveys, which suggests that GDP growth in the third quarter could be a decent 3.0%. So although the weak first quarter means that GDP growth this year as a whole is still likely to be around 2.0%, a strong second half of the year sets things up nicely for growth of 3.0% next year. The rise in corporate profits is also encouraging; Hales points out that domestic earnings outperformed profits overseas. These higher profits will help companies pay higher wages too.. We believe there is limited scope for profits to continue to grow rapidly when a cyclical rebound in labour\u2019s share of income is on the cards. Some instant reaction to the news that America\u2019s economy grew faster than we thought last quarter: Stephen Baines, at investment manager at Kames Capital, is struck that US government bond yields are still historically low, despite America\u2019s solid growth: The US economy grew even faster than first thought, highlighting the strength of its recovery after last winter\u2019s disruption. Revised data, just released, shows that America\u2019s GDP expanded at an annual rate of 4.2% in the second quarter of this year. That\u2019s around 1.05% quarter-on-quarter. The Commerce Department had initially estimated that GDP rose by 4.0% annualised (or 1% q/q). So it\u2019s a relatively small upgrade, but still better than expected. Business spending, and exports, were both stronger than thought. Skimming the data quickly, it shows that consumer spending rose by 2.5% in the second quarter. Business investment spiked by 8.4% - which suggests US firms grew more confident, and also made investments that had been delayed by the bad winter. The Commerce Department raised its forecast for export growth to 10.1%, up from 9.5%. Imports still grew faster, though, up 11.0%, Credit Agricole\u2019s Frederik Ducrozet has crunched through today\u2019s German inflation data, and reckons that tomorrow\u2019s reading for eurozone CPI could be better than expected. However, with most economists predicting a fall from 0.4% to 0.3%, the figures won\u2019t be great -- as analyst Lorcan Roche Kelly points out: The German inflation rate held steady at 0.8% thanks to a rise in service sector costs, which countered a big drop in energy prices. Food inflation also ticked up. Here\u2019s the details: JUST IN. Germany\u2019s inflation rate has held steady this month, according to data just released by the Federal Statistics Office. The harmonised German consumer prices index came in at +0.8% year-on-year for August, the same as last month. On a monthly basis, prices are flat compared to July. The figures are broadly in line with expectations. The data sets the tone for tomorrow\u2019s eurozone inflation data, which will determine whether or not the European Central Bank is prompted into taking new monetary policy action at next week\u2019s meeting. These reports of Russian troop movements into Ukraine have also pushed investors into safer eurozone government bonds. German bunds are as popular as ever. This has driven down the interest rate, or yield, on 10-year bunds to just 0.88% today. And the 30-year bund is only yielding 1.72%, a remarkably low rate of return for a long-dated bond, showing the markets anticipating low growth and inflation in the long-term. Global stock markets are in retreat, led by a sell-off in Moscow, after Ukraine\u2019s president declared that Russian troops had entered his country. Russia\u2019s MICEX has slid by almost 2%, and the German DAX is down 1.3%, as geopolitics looms over the financial sector again. The gold prices has jumped by 1%, as money flowed into safe-haven assets. The selloff came after Ukraine prime minister President Petro Poroshenko announced he had cancelled a visit to Turkey. Confusingly, Poroshenko was initially quoted as saying \u201cAn invasion of Russian forces has taken place\u201d. But we\u2019re now seeing that corrected to \u201cRussian troop movements into Ukraine\u201d. Either way, a new front appeared to be opening up in the Russia-Ukraine conflict today, at the southern border between the two countries. One soldier said there was \u201can open war of Russia against Ukraine\u201d, as Ukrainian forces dug in around the southern town of Mariupol. My colleague Oksana Grytsenko reports: A mixture of soldiers, police and volunteers are fortifying a checkpoint designed to defend the city of nearly 500,000 from pro-Russian forces who took control of part of the town of Novoazovsk, and are gradually moving towards Mariupol. When civilian cars approach the exit of the city leading to Novoazovsk, pro-Ukrainian fighters warn them to go back for their own safety. Ukrainian fighters falling back from Novoazovsk say they have not totally given up the town but are outnumbered by their adversaries. \u201cThe right bank [of the river in Novoazovsk] is ours and the left one is not,\u201d Leonid Matiukhin, Ukraine\u2019s army spokesman, told the Guardian. More here: Ukraine forces brace for fighting with pro-Russian troops at \u2018second front\u2019 All the main European markets are down: A flurry of newsflashes from Reuters also show military movements in the region: REUTERS REPORTER IN SOUTHERN RUSSIA SEES ARMOURED COLUMN NEAR RUSSIAN VILLAGE ABOUT 3 KM FROM UKRAINE-RUSSIAN BORDER TROOPS SITTING ON ARMOURED PERSONNEL CARRIERS HAVE DIRTY FACES, ONE HAS INJURED FACE, ONE TRUCK IS DAMAGED AND BEING TOWED - REUTERS REPORTER TROOPS AND VEHICLES HAVE NO MILITARY IDENTIFICATION MARKINGS, VEHICLE NUMBER PLATES REMOVED - REUTERS REPORTER SOME SOLDIERS WEARING WHITE ARMBANDS, VEHICLES MARKED WITH WHITE CIRCLES - REUTERS REPORTER REUTERS REPORTER IN SOUTHERN RUSSIA SEES HELICOPTER WITH RED STAR ON IT LAND NEXT TO UNIT OF UNIDENTIFIED TROOPS Back in Paris, the French government is trying to defuse the row that broke out this morning after the new economy minister suggested abolishing the 35-hour working week. Prime minister Manuel Valls\u2019 office has insisted there are no plans to make the French work longer hours. In a statement, it said: \u201cThe government has no intention of going back on the legal length of the working week.\u201d We should remember that Emmanuel Macron made the comments in an interview before he was appointed to the government, so he wasn\u2019t outlining new policies. The robust response from the unions (who insisted the matter was a non-starter) shows how tough a battle it would be... Today\u2019s slide in eurozone economic confidence shows that the escalating tensions between Russia and the West, and unrest in the Middle East, are hitting Europe\u2019s economy. Jyrki Katainen, the former Finnish prime minister and current EC commissioner, says: \u201cThe fall in economic confidence in Europe in August, particularly among industry and consumers, is not a surprise following the disappointing second quarter growth figures and the geopolitical tensions that have marked this summer.\u201d (via Reuters) Martin van Vliet, a senior economist at ING, agrees: It seems that the ongoing geopolitical tensions are finally starting to take their toll on overall sentiment across the euro region. Deutsche Bank is taking a turn on the naughty step today. It\u2019s just been fined \u00a34.7m by the City watchdog, the FCA, for failing to record almost 30 million derivative transactions. This makes Deutsche the 11th firm to be fined for reporting failings. FCA enforcement director Tracey McDermott says there is \u201csimply no excuse\u201d for not getting it right. Europe\u2019s businesses and consumers are less confidence about economic prospects, according to the latest survey conducted by the European Commission. The EC found that morale in the retail, consumer and industry sectors has fallen this month, to its lowest level of 2014. Industry managers are more cautious about future production, while retailers are increasingly worried about the present and future situation. This may reflect geopolitical worries, such as the tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as recent disappointing economic data. The report also shows that households may be losing faith in the European Central Bank\u2019s ability to meet its inflation target. Price expectations among consumers hit the lowest level in four years (see graph below). Here\u2019s the key points: Economic sentiment in the region has fallen, to 100.6 on its index from 102.1 in July Consumer sentiment is down too, dropping to -10.0 from -8.4 in July. This wipes out the recovery in confidence reported in recent months, with businesses across the economy becoming more downbeat. The EC says: After a broadly flat development over the last five months, August\u2019s decrease shifted the euro area headline indicator back to its December 2013 level. Worsened sentiment resulted from deterioration in retail trade, consumer, industry, and, to a lesser extent, services confidence. Construction confidence remained broadly unchanged. Most eurozone countries are more pessimistic this month: Sentiment dropped significantly in Italy (-4.1), sending the ESI below its long-term average of 100, and in Germany (-1.9). Milder contractions were booked also in France (-0.6) and the Netherlands (-0.8), while sentiment remained flat in Spain. The decline in consumer confidence was due to people becoming more worried about long-term employment prospects, the general state of the economy, and their households\u2019 future financial prospects. While this chart shows how inflation expectations among consumers and companies have fallen (despite ECB chief Mario Draghi repeatedly insisting they remain \u2018well-anchored). Here\u2019s the full report. CSR, the Cambridge-based \u201cInternet Of Things\u201d chipmaker, has just told the City that it has turned down a takeover approach. In a brief statement, the company said it had rejected an approach from US-based Microchip Technologies, and is now pondering its options. CSR told shareholders that: The Board of CSR plc (\u201cCSR\u201d) notes recent press speculation and confirms that it has received an approach regarding a possible offer for the company from Microchip. The price proposed by Microchip has been rejected and the Board is considering its options for the company. Shares in CSR have soared by around 25% this morning as traders anticipate a bid battle. The Financial Times reported early this morning that CSR could be sold for up to $3bn. Last night it was worth under $1.6bn. More details in Nick Fletcher\u2019s early-morning market report: FTSE falters but chipmaker CSR soars on $3bn sale hopes Amid the steady stream of economic data, Italy\u2019s retail sales slide has bottomed out. Sales were flat month-on-month in June, after a 0.6% decline in May. That left spending 2.6% lower than a year ago, due to weak consumer spending and weak price rises. Food spending rose in June, but non-food sales declined. More German regional inflation data has hit the wires, and it also suggests the overall reading (at 1pm) won\u2019t be a shocker. Consumer prices in Bavaria rose by 0.1% month-on-month, and are 0.8% higher annually - in line with the forecast for Germany overall. North Rhine Westphalia CPI was also a little stronger than expected, up from 1.0% year-on-year to 1.1%. And this chart shows that while M3 money supply has picked up, loans to private firms in the eurozone are still falling, albeit at a slower rate. The ECB will be hoping that recently announced stimulus measures will help. Its new TLTRO programme should encourage eurozone banks to lend more. We also have encouraging news on money supply in the eurozone. The M3 measure of money supply (the broadest one), jumped by 1.8% year-on-year in July. That beats expectations of a 1.5% rise. The report also shows another worrying drop in loans to the private sector, down 1.6% year-on-year. But the headline figure is being taken as a positive signal; it takes a bit of pressure off Mario Draghi at the ECB to launch a quantitative easing programme. The euro has strengthened a little., up 0.15% at $1.3211. Just in: The number of people out of work in Germany has risen this month. The seasonally adjusted jobless total rose by 1,000 in August, to 2.901 million people, dashing predictions of a fall of around 5,000 people. Stripping out seasonal factors, the unadjusted total rose by 2.902m this month, up from 2.871m in July. The headline seasonally adjusted rate was unchanged, though, at 6.7%. Update: Laurent Berger, head of the CFDT trade union, went on to insist that France\u2019s 35-hour week could not be abolished, as economy minister Macron suggests. He told TV news that: It is out of the question. The subject is closed. (quote via Reuters) France\u2019s new economy minister has raised the possibility of abolishing the country\u2019s 35-hour working week in a bid to improve competitiveness, angering the country\u2019s unions. Speaking to Le Point magazine shortly before he was appointed, Emmanuel Macron said that France suffers from \u201ctwo specific problems\u201d - weak competitiveness, and its budget deficit. One solution, he suggested, would be to allow firms to break away from current rules on working hours, as long as unions agreed. Macron said: \u201cWe could authorise companies and sectors, provided there is a majority (union) agreement on this, to have exceptions to the rules on working time and remuneration\u201d Macron\u2019s \u2018suggestion\u2019 has not gone down well with French unions. Laurent Berger, head of the France\u2019s moderate CFDT trade union, has already declared that Macron had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d by giving the interview. The Le Point interview is here, but behind a paywall. The France Bleu radio network has more details here. The Saxony inflation data also shows significant drops in the price of energy, and food, echoing a recent trend in the eurozone. The first slice of German inflation data is out, and it\u2019s mildly reassuring. Prices in the Saxony region were flat month-on-month in August, which left the Saxony consumer prices index up 0.8% year-on-year, unchanged from July. That could suggest that the main German CPI reading, at 1pm, won\u2019t be the major shock that could spark action from the European Central Bank..... And here\u2019s a chart with some details of Spain\u2019s 0.6% growth last quarter -- with household spending and building work both rising. This chart shows Spain\u2019s slide into deflation in recent months: Prices in Spain\u2019s shops kept falling this month, highlighting Europe\u2019s weak inflation problem. The Spanish consumer prices index slid to minus 0.5% year-on-year for August, down from -0.4% in July. It looks like the weakest reading in five years; economists had been braced for an even bigger drop. Spain\u2019s statistics office has confirmed that its economy outpaced the eurozone in the last quarter, with GDP expanding by 0.6%. That beats Germany (which contracted by 0.2%), France (flat), and the eurozone average (+0.1%) in April-June. Overnight, UK chancellor George Osborne has been warned that Britain is still strugging to boost its exports, despite the economic recovery. The British Chambers of Commerce said Osborne is missing his target of doubling exports by the end of the decade, as it slashed its targets for export growth. More here: George Osborne will miss UK export target, BCC warns Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. It\u2019s all eyes on Germany and the eurozone this morning, with fresh data giving an insight into conditions in Europe\u2019s largest economy. It will also indicate whether the European Central Bank will unleash new stimulus measures next week. The German consumer prices index, released at 1pm BST, could show whether Europe is slipping closer to deflation. Economists predict that prices were flat month-on-month, meaning the CPI would be up just 0.8% year-on-year. A weaker reading could give the ECB the impetus to ease monetary policy. There\u2019s regional data to watch out for through the morning, too, and inflation data from Spain. Frankfurt insiders were playing down the prospect of action at next week\u2019s meeting, unless the main eurozone inflation reading - due on Friday morning \u2013 is particularly poor. New German unemployment data is then released at 8.55am, shortly followed by new M3 money supply data -- another factor which the ECB will weigh up when deciding what to do next week. The flurry of data continues at 10am BST, with new eurozone confidence data \u2013 that will show whether recent signs of economic weakness are spooking consumers and businesses. This afternoon, we\u2019ll get a reminder of how Europe is falling behind America, with the second estimate of US GDP for the second quarter of 2014 (at 1.30pm BST). The initial reading showed the US growing at an annual rate of 4.0%. In the corporate world, there\u2019s results from recruitment firm Hays and bookmaker Paddy Power to digest. And we\u2019ll be watching Greece, where the government is preparing for the next session of talks with its international lenders, next week...",

      "bodyText": "The Irish bookmaker Paddy Power has attempted to laugh off its misfortunes in the first half of the year when a run of punter-friendly football results \"proved costlier than John Cleese's divorce payments\". After announcing that profits dropped by 20%, the bookie pointed out that January and March were \"dream weekends\" for punters when 16, and then 17, out of the 21 most-backed teams won their matches. The falling profits also came despite the six months including the first fortnight of the World Cup in Brazil and the bookmaker winning an extra \u20ac16.7m (\u00a313.3m) from its customers, as its income for the half year rose to \u20ac396.5m. However, the bookie's costs also soared by almost 8% as it increased its marketing budget by 34% to \u20ac53.8m. In its review of the year so far the bookmaker reminded shareholders where some of that marketing spending had gone. \"To analyse England's chances of success in Brazil scientifically, we commissioned everyone's favourite physicist, Professor Stephen Hawking. The media reaction was nuclear, including coverage in every UK and Irish national newspaper. \"We then caused outrage by appearing to have carved 'C'mon England, PP' into the Amazon rainforest \u2013 later revealing it to be a hoax image to promote awareness of deforestation with a carving in the same style of 'We didn't give the Amazon a Brazilian'. The story trended on Twitter with 35 million impressions and was the most read story on Reddit with almost a million views (displacing thousands of cat videos!).\" The soaring marketing spending represents a return of confidence at the bookmaker, which made its name with some outrageous marketing campaigns. In 2005 it drew displeasure from the Vatican after pitching up in St Peter's Square and displaying odds for the papal election, which came 11 years after the group had offered punters 100,000-1 on Pope John Paul II being the next Glasgow Rangers signing. It then implied that His Holiness really had a chance of trotting out at Ibrox by refunding all bets after he slipped in the shower and injured himself. Thursday's results statement added: \"We never forget it is all about entertainment. Unlike Man United fans, we got immense enjoyment from David Moyes's tenure as manager. We put an 'In case of emergency break glass' encased Alex Ferguson wax model outside Old Trafford, positioned a 'grim reaper' in the crowd behind Moyes at Goodison Park (for what proved indeed to be his last match in charge), and erected a giant bronze statue of Moyes for services rendered \u2013 outside Anfield before the Liverpool versus Chelsea showdown.\" The heightened marketing costs may have raised a laugh from observers but they caused pre-tax profits to fall to \u20ac61.6m from \u20ac77m. Still, the bookmaker remains confident for the second half of the year. Patrick Kennedy, the group's chief executive, said: \"We had a cracking World Cup which generated stakes of almost \u20ac200m, 130% ahead of the previous tournament. Australia continues to power ahead and Italy has made significant progress. The second half has started well with good stakes growth and a rebound in sports results.\" The positive comments on the World Cup \u2013 the industry's largest event, which started poorly for the bookmakers before turning in their favour \u2013 echoes statements from rivals Ladbrokes and William Hill. Shares in the Irish bookmaker slipped by 0.505 cents to \u20ac49.",

The brightly coloured missives publicising bargains on fitness kit in January, skiing gear in early winter and regular regional specials such as \"Spanish week\", are to be confined to stores as Lidl turns to social media and broadcast advertising to spread its message. \"We've been really German in the way we are dropping leaflets through letter boxes saying 'you have to read this and see our prices and come and shop' ... We needed to change to become more of a British retailer not just by what we offer and our quality and price perception but how we engage with our customers,\" said Lidl's Ronny Gottschlich, UK managing director, as he launched the \u00a320m new marketing plan with a glamorous event at London's Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. The retailer will spend \u00a320m over the next five or six months on the campaign, which aims to get shoppers spreading the word about their love of the German discounter via social media under the #Lidlsurprises banner. Ads featuring shoppers tasting and buying champagne, steak and cheese at an unbranded \"farmers market\" set up by Lidl, where it secretly filmed their enjoyment of the food, will kick off on Friday night in cinemas before launching on ITV 1 on 4 September. The retailer is also planning online adverts. Peter Souter from Lidl's advertising agency TBWA said Lidl now had more than 650,000 people in its \"digital community\" on Facebook. He said: \"Today you can't buy your way into people's minds, you have to find a way into their hearts.\" Lidl's use of TV and social media brings it in line with most of its UK competitors, which also shy away from the rather expensive option of house-to-house leafleting. But industry insiders warned that Lidl risked losing touch with its core shoppers, particularly older people and the less well off, who were less likely to follow it on Twitter or monitor Facebook. While TV ads build brand awareness, they are less of an immediate call to arms than promotional leaflets flagging specific deals. \"If you are a supermarket you can be quite sophisticated with a leaflet drop choosing particular streets or blocks of flats,\" one advertising expert said. \"You can't do that with social media.\"",

This is the time when businesses are thinking about expansion, weighing up the costs and benefits of buying some new kit. It should be a moment in the sun for Funding for Lending (FLS), the government's scheme that provides banks with incentives to provide credit for investment projects. But it isn't happening. The Bank of England's quarterly report on the FLS showed that businesses repaid more to banks in the three months to June than they received. Net lending to large companies was -\u00a33.5bn; net lending to small and medium sized companies was negative by \u00a30.4bn. While it can be argued that borrowing would be even tougher had it not been for the FLS, the numbers tell their own story. The scheme is not delivering. The small but potentially rapidly growing companies are not getting help from the banks, despite the incentives provided by the government and the changes to focus the scheme purely on business lending. Don't blame the Bank of England (or the Treasury) for this. The FLS was a worthwhile experiment and did succeed in one respect: the original scheme allowed banks to access funds cheaply for mortgage lending, and this was a big factor in reigniting the housing economy. That, in turn, was the crucial factor in ending two years of flatlining in 2011 and 2012. Threadneedle Street says that weak demand for loans from SMEs could be a factor behind the -\u00a30.4bn net lending figure in the second quarter. That, though, seems to be at odds both with the strength of domestic demand and attempts by smaller companies to circumvent the traditional banking system. Peer-to-peer lending, for example, seems to be booming. Instead, the real problem is that the traditional high street banks find it safer and more profitable to lend against bricks and mortar than they do to lend to a company that might go bust in the next couple of years. The fact that the government is using its new Business Bank to finance peer-to-peer lending suggests it realises the traditional banking model is broken. One solution would be to put the failed FLS down to experience and channel more capital into the Business Bank so that it can expand its activities.",

The small but potentially rapidly growing companies are not getting help from the banks, despite the incentives provided by the government and the changes to focus the scheme purely on business lending.</p> <p>Don't blame the Bank of England (or the Treasury) for this. The FLS was a worthwhile experiment and did succeed in one respect: the original scheme allowed banks to access funds cheaply for mortgage lending, and this was a big factor in reigniting the housing economy. That, in turn, was the crucial factor in ending two years of flatlining in 2011 and 2012.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street says that weak demand for loans from SMEs could be a factor behind the -\u00a30.4bn net lending figure in the second quarter. That, though, seems to be at odds both with the strength of domestic demand and attempts by smaller companies to circumvent the traditional banking system. Peer-to-peer lending, for example, seems to be booming.</p> <p>Instead, the real problem is that the traditional high street banks find it safer and more profitable to lend against bricks and mortar than they do to lend to a company that might go bust in the next couple of years. The fact that the government is using its new Business Bank to finance peer-to-peer lending suggests it realises the traditional banking model is broken. One solution would be to put the failed FLS down to experience and channel more capital into the Business Bank so that it can expand its activities.</p>",
