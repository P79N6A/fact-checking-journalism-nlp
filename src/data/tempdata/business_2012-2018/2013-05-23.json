      "bodyText": "The Japanese have long been committed whisky drinkers, and until recently that meant holing up in a small, dark den designed for serious drinking. But the country's leading distiller has been revolutionising drinking culture with the aid of a pint glass and a more than generous slug of soda. The whisky highballs introduced by Suntory, the privately owned Japanese drinks conglomerate that has the lion's share of the country's whisky market, seem to have worked. Sales have been up more than 10% a year over the past three years. The group's Yamazaki distillery on the outskirts of Japan's imperial city, Kyoto, is the home of Japanese whisky and this year is celebrating its 90th anniversary. It is often forgotten outside Japan that as well as importing large quantities of scotch, the Japanese make their own malts. Indeed, more than 80% of the domestic market is accounted for by whisky produced in Japan. As in the UK, whisky drinkers were by tradition male and relatively old, but targeting younger drinkers with the highball has changed all that. \"Domestic consumption was declining up until three years ago,\" said Hiroyoshi Miyamoto, the former general manager at Yamazaki and now Suntory's global brand ambassador, \"but it all turned around in 2009 when we introduced the highball. That changed the attitude of Japanese consumers.\" Miyamoto said younger drinkers found old-style whisky bars intimidating, so Suntory was developing a new generation of highball bars and getting its cheaper whiskies into other bars where they could be sold as an alternative to beer. The capital, Tokyo, has plenty of the old and the new. The ultimate secret city, it has an estimated 300,000 bars, many hidden in basements or office blocks. Campbell Toun Loch, a subterranean bar in the Ginza district which despite the eccentric spelling does indeed prove to be full of whisky, seats just eight. It is no bigger than a large cupboard, but contains hundreds of bottles of whisky, three deep on the counter. When you order, the barman plonks the bottle down in front of you as if he expects it to be polished off. This is a bar for the connoisseur. In some of the more formal bars, there are rocking chairs and oak panelling. The atmosphere resembles that of a gentlemen's club. Bartenders in ties and waistcoats theatrically chip away to make the perfect iceball, over which the spirit is lovingly poured. This is whisky drinking as performance art. At the other end of the scale is Marugin, a noisy, bustling bar in the heart of Ginza district, full of salarymen who have just finished work and are desperate to let off steam. Whereas Campbell Toun Loch caters for the solitary, late-night drinker, Marugin attracts lively early-evening groups, eating, smoking and knocking back highballs. Marugin even has whisky on draught, a trend Suntory is keen to encourage despite the high cost of maintaining the pumps. \"We are trying to create a buzz around whisky,\" said brand manager Keita Minari. \"A popular TV programme in Japan picked up on Marugin and the new trend for drinking highballs, and it said people there were drinking whisky more than beer. When you are having a meal, whisky doesn't stay in your stomach, unlike beer where you get full very easily.\" There are, though, no immediate plans to transplant the whisky-drinking revolution to Europe, where Suntory's brands \u2013 principally the Yamazaki and Hakushu malts \u2013 are premium products. \"We have to do these things step by step,\" said Minari. \"Scots are coming to Japan, seeing the phenomenon of the highball and saying we should do the same thing in the UK, but it's too early. Our share of the UK market is very small compared with scotch whisky. At the moment we still have to let people know that Japan is making whisky.\" Japanese whisky exports to the UK and Europe used to be negligible, but when Yamazaki 12 Years Old won a gold award at the International Spirits Challenge in 2003, Suntory decided to try to take on scotch on its home ground, and now has a foothold in the market. Shunichi Ninomiya, senior general manager in Suntory's international liquor division, said the company had to be careful not to undermine its premium image in the UK and Europe by introducing cheaper brands such as its Kakubin blended whisky, the biggest-selling whisky in Japan. If it did go down the highball route in western markets, he said, it would probably be via its premium malts. Draught whisky and whisky in cans \u2013 available in vending machines in Japan to consumers with an ID smartcard to prove their age \u2013 are still a long way off in the west. Asked about the dangers in targeting younger drinkers and setting up whisky as a rival to beer, Minari insisted the Japanese were less prone to binge drinking than the British. Yet just opposite Marugin I saw a young salaryman clearly the worse for drink lying comatose in the street. A few minutes later, ambulance personnel were attending to him. I have no idea what he was drinking, but it does seem that not every young Japanese drinker knows when to stop. \"Regulation is loose in Japan,\" admitted a spokesman at Suntory's ad agency, \"but we are trying to champion responsible drinking. We are conscious of our position in society, and communication-wise we make sure it's delivered in a correct manner.\" The chief operating officer of the international liquor division, Satoru \"Tiger\" Abe \u2013 senior executives in Japan tend to be named after golfers \u2013 insisted that the increasing consumption of highballs made anti-social drinking less likely, because the whisky was heavily diluted and usually accompanied by food. He hopes the salaryman on the pavement in Ginza will be the exception, and this is one revolution that can be carried out without victims.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain suffered one of the biggest falls in investment among the G8 last year, adding to concerns that UK businesses are losing competitiveness by refusing to spend on new equipment. According to an analysis by the House of Commons library, Britain invests a lower percentage of GDP than any other of the leading western industrial nations. The figures, obtained by Labour, show that while most G8 countries have increased investment as a proportion of national income since 2010, Britain suffered the biggest fall of any G8 country apart from Italy. In France and Germany, capital investment has remained largely stable at 19.9% and 17.2% of GDP respectively. In Britain it fell 0.8 percentage points between 2010 and 2012, to 14.3% of GDP. The US, Japan, Canada, Italy and Russia have higher levels of capital investment than the UK. David Cameron hosts the G8 countries in County Fermanagh in July and is expected to stress the need for the world's leading economies to make greater efforts to generate growth. The Treasury's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has pencilled in a strong rise in business investment next year in response to growing optimism that the UK recovery will be gathering strength in 2014. However, the OBR has been forecasting a bounce in business investment for each year of this parliament only to see its targets missed. Ed Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: \"Britain has a poor historical record on investing for the long term but things have got worse not better over the last three years. Since 2010 we've seen the biggest fall in investment as a share of national income of any G8 country other than Italy.\" \"Alongside action now to ensure we have a strong and sustained recovery, we need long-term reforms to make our economy stronger, more balanced and better able to attract new investment and create skilled jobs for the future.\" In March Labour published a report by former Institute of Directors boss Sir George Cox, who found businesses wanted the government to play a constructive part in fostering long-term investment. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that business investment was a significant drag on growth in the first three months of the year. The ONS confirmed that Britain avoided a triple dip recession with growth of 0.3% in the first quarter, but a breakdown of the figures showed that investment dropped 0.4%, mainly offset by stockpiling by British businesses. A Treasury official said several surveys highlighted a nascent recovery in business confidence and activity leading to the expected increase in investment next year. \"There are positive signs that activity is picking up across the economy.\" The chancellor, George Osborne, is keen to move away from Britain's traditional dependence on the City and government spending as the chief drivers of economic activity. In the first two years of the coalition he focused on providing support for manufacturers and increasing the amount of credit available to firms for investment. However, separate ONS figures showed that a 0.2% increase in activity across the services sector in March relied heavily on a buoyant banking sector and a modest rise in government spending. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, described the reliance on stockpiling as \"unimpressive\". Capital Economics analyst Martin Beck said talk of rebalancing the economy looked \"forlorn\".",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Halfords' chief executive has outlined a three-year turnaround plan for the struggling bicycles and car parts chain, but it will come at a cost to investors, who have seen the dividend cut by 35%. Matt Davies has set a sales target of \u00a31bn by 2016, but said that profits would remain flat for at least two years as the chain invests \u00a3100m in staff training, store revamps and a better online offering. The plan comes as full year pre-tax profits fell 22% to \u00a372m, on sales up 1% at \u00a3871m. The shares plunged 63p, or 16%, to 333p as investors reacted to the news that they would be giving up a large chunk of their dividend. Davies, who recently joined from Pets at Home, said: \"The biggest risk is a do-nothing scenario and I'm asking shareholders for patience. I'm a shareholder too and will suffer, and I'm very aware the dividend is important to shareholders.\" He pointed out that 10 of the last 12 quarters had seen falling sales \u2013 a run broken only last spring and summer when British success in the Tour de France and the Olympics helped bicycle sales. The store now stocks Pinarello cycles \u2013 the Italian brand used by Sir Bradley Wiggins, pictured, and the Team Sky cycling squad. The business will focus significantly on bicycles, hoping to sell 1m a year, and will refit every cycle department. But Davies acknowledged Halfords has been squeezed by rivals and online sellers. Without addressing years of underinvestment, the company would suffer further, he said. \"Stores are a bit tired so we really need to invest in them. We are also keen to get in knowledgeable people.\" Staff will undertake a three-month course on joining the company, and will earn pay rises by completing further training, eventually leading to the position of store \"guru\". Around \u00a350m will be invested in store refurbishments, with 150 stores to be revamped by 2016, and a further \u00a350m will go on training and improving the company's website and supply chain. Staff turnover at the stores has been consistently high: around 20% of new workers leave within three months. Davies wants to halve that number. He said: \"That's a problem if you are not recognising people and training people to build careers with Halfords.\" The company suffered from a fall in sales of car accessories. Davies said young drivers who \"pimp up their car\" were staying away because they could no longer afford the insurance. Its Autocentre business continues to perform well, with sales up 13.5% to \u00a3125.8m, and management hopes to open 700 repair centres by 2016, offering MOTs and servicing. Halfords currently has 287 sites. However, the company said short-term profit expectations at Autocentre since it was purchased in 2010 were \"overly optimistic\" now that an expansion was under way. Analysts appeared impressed with the turnaround plans, despite the dividend cut. Philip Dorgan from Panmure Gordon said: \"We like the plan and we like the \u00a31bn revenue target, but we were wrong to assume fast payback from investment.\" Bethany Hocking at Investec said: \"While near-term downgrades are clearly disappointing, we think the plan is credible and needed.\"",

Davies wants to halve that number.</p> <p>He said: \"That's a problem if you are not recognising people and training people to build careers with Halfords.\"</p> <p>The company suffered from a fall in sales of car accessories. Davies said young drivers who \"pimp up their car\" were staying away because they could no longer afford the insurance.</p> <p>Its Autocentre business continues to perform well, with sales up 13.5% to \u00a3125.8m, and management hopes to open 700 repair centres by 2016, offering MOTs and servicing. Halfords currently has 287 sites.</p> <p>However, the company said short-term profit expectations at Autocentre since it was purchased in 2010 were \"overly optimistic\" now that an expansion was under way.</p> <p>Analysts appeared impressed with the turnaround plans, despite the dividend cut. Philip Dorgan from Panmure Gordon said: \"We like the plan and we like the \u00a31bn revenue target, but we were wrong to assume fast payback from investment.\"</p> <p>Bethany Hocking at Investec said: \"While near-term downgrades are clearly disappointing, we think the plan is credible and needed.\"</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former boss of Tesco's failed US chain Fresh &amp; Easy has received a \u00a31.7m payoff despite the business being shut down after repeated losses. Tim Mason, who departed in December after 30 years at the group, was awarded \"liquidation damages\" equivalent to his annual salary plus a sum equal to his average bonus over the past two years. Tesco announced last month it would exit the US after racking up total costs of \u00a31.5bn. Fresh &amp; Easy opened in 2007 but never made a profit. Tesco's checkout staff, meanwhile, learned that their annual shares bonus pot has been halved after the retailer's first fall in annual profits in almost 20 years. Around 280,000 UK staff will receive a total of \u00a356m in shares, down from \u00a3110m a year earlier and worth a maximum per worker of \u00a31,625. On top of his payment for \"loss of office\", Mason also earned a \u00a3691,000 salary and received \u00a3400,000 in benefits last year. He had built up a \u00a310.4m pension, and owns more than 1m shares, worth around \u00a34.1m. He also has options on a further 1.15m shares, and will be paid \u00a3100,000 in \"repatriation costs\" to return to the UK. The retailer's disappointing performance meant that around 5,000 top managers, including chief executive Phil Clarke, missed out on a bonus and long-term shares awards for last year. Clarke received salary and benefits worth \u00a31.2m, 1.4% higher compared with a year earlier. The total pay of finance director Laurie McIlwee fell 19% to \u00a3917,000. Pre-tax profit halved to \u00a31.96bn in the year to 23 February. As well as taking a hit on the US business, Tesco also made a UK property writedown of \u00a3804m, after abandoning plans to develop more than 100 sites. \"The year just ended was a challenging one,\" said Stuart Chambers, chairman of the remuneration committee, in the report. \"Our financial performance fell short of where we wanted it to be, which in turn resulted in no annual bonus being paid to the senior management team for 2012-13. The long-term incentives that were due to vest this year also lapsed as performance targets were not met.\" Tesco bosses will only receive an annual bonus in the future if profits grow. The retailer also said, however, that future bonuses would be less focused on short-term profits than in the past, and more focused on other \"strategic and operational\" measures, including customer service and colleague \"engagement\". In terms of financial measures, the level of bonuses will be determined by internet sales, like-for-like sales, and working capital as well as profits. Chambers said that a number of factors had weighed on the company's financial performance, including its decision to reinvest profits in the UK business to improve the shopping experience for customers, and the closure of Fresh &amp; Easy. He added that \"external challenges\", including a weak economic backdrop in central Europe and the regulatory restrictions on opening hours in South Korea, had also had an impact. He said that the senior management's failure to earn a bonus and long-term incentives showed that Tesco's remuneration policy was \"effective in aligning pay with performance.\" Richard Brasher, the former head of Tesco's UK business, who was squeezed out in March 2012 after just a year in the job, also received a golden goodbye. He was paid \"liquidated damages\" of \u00a31.3m. At the time of his departure Clarke said he was taking control of Brasher's UK operation in addition to his duties as group chief executive. Clarke said in the report that Tesco would more focused in the future on growth, consuming less capital, and generating more free cash flow. \"Making this transformation in all its aspects will of course not be without its challenges \u2013 and the clearest evidence of this can be seen in the first reduction in profits of the group for two decades, which we reported on in April,\" he said. \"Everything we are doing reflects my determination to deliver shareholder value, an appropriate balance between investing for future growth, and delivering sustainable returns for our shareholders.\"",

      "bodyText": "Mothercare is crawling towards a recovery as chief executive Simon Calver insisted the UK company was on target to break even within two years. The mother and baby goods retailer saw UK sales drop 11% to \u00a3500m last year. It reported a loss of \u00a321.7m, a slight improvement on the \u00a324.7m loss recorded in the previous 12 months. The business turned in an impressive international performance, with sales up more than 8% to nearly \u00a3730m and profit up 20% to \u00a342m, with China, India and Russia expanding successfully. Total group sales, including wholesale operations, were down 0.3% to \u00a31.23bn with profits of just \u00a38.3m. Calver said the company must slim down its store portfolio. He closed 56 stores last year, and plans a further 30 closures this year. The chain currently has 255 UK stores, but he hopes to whittle that down to 200. There are 1,300 outlets worldwide. He explained: \"This is the first [year] of a three-year turnaround. We needed to shut down those stores because they were loss-making and traditionally we've had too many.\" Most of the closures have been Early Learning Centres, with the brand being integrated into Mothercare stores. The remaining loss-making stores due to close are mainly in high street locations rather than out-of-town centres. In recent years Mothercare has struggled with competition for accessories and buggies from online stores such as Kiddicare, while supermarkets have launched lines of baby and children's clothes. Calver hopes to increase online sales, using his skills as the former boss of Lovefilm, alongside new chief finance officer Matt Smith, who used to work for Argos. Last year internet sales grew 4%, with 40% of orders made through the new mobile phone app, and click-and-collect services have been rolled out across all stores. However, some analysts were less convinced the company can turn itself around, suggesting the plan was too ambitious. Panmure Gordon analysts said: \"It remains to be seen whether management has closed the right stores. We continue to believe that Mothercare will struggle to break even in the UK according to its own timetable.\" The shares closed down 9p at 355p, although, they have more than doubled since Calver joined the company.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Leading shares hit by worries about Chinese slowdown and possible ending of US bond buying programme", 
      "body": "<p>As markets suffered a sharp correction after their recent gains, defensive shares were among the few bright spots.</p> <p><strong>United Utilities</strong> added 6p to 787.5p after the water company said it would raise its final dividend by 7.2% despite a 9.3% fall in full year profits, which was due to a decrease in deferred taxation credit.</p> <p>Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital said the numbers were in line with market expectations:</p> <blockquote> Underlying operating profit came in at \u00a3607m, underlying PBT came in at \u00a3354m \u2013 both broadly in line with consensus. [It remains] on track or ahead of schedule in meeting its 5-year regulatory outperformance targets. </blockquote> <p>Sweeteners group <strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> rose 14p to 871p while <strong>J Sainsbury</strong> edged up 0.3p to 382.3p, both deemed to be havens for investors.</p> <p>Overall though, markets were on the slide following weaker than expected Chinese factory data, which raised fears of a slowdown in the country's economy, and confusion over the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing plans. The recent market surge, with the FTSE 100 coming within 90 points of its all time high on Wednesday, has been partly driven by stimulus measures from the central banks designed to boost the global economy. So comments from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke about a possible easing of its $85bn a month bond buying programme unsettled investors, and this was later compounded by the Fed's latest minutes which showed that some members thought such a move could come as soon as June. Stronger than forecast US weekly jobless claims added more fuel to the idea of a pause in the programme.</p> <p>Also hitting sentiment was the news that the HSBC index of Chinese manufacturing had fallen below 50 for the first time since October, signalling contraction, which helped send the Nikkei down 7% overnight and pushed Japanese bond yields higher.</p> <p>Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote> Taken in isolation, the Ben Bernanke speech, the Fed minutes and the China data would probably only have a limited impact, but having come all at once investors are finding it hard to be particularly sanguine. That said, even if this does turn into a sustained down move over a period of a week or two, the fundamental narrative of central bank easing and improving economic data should reassert itself. <br> </blockquote> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished down 143.48 points at 6696.79, a 2.1% decline which marks its worst daily performance since exactly a year ago.</p> <p>With the weak Chinese data, mining shares were among the biggest fallers. <strong>Anglo American</strong> lost 83.5p to \u00a315.70p while <strong>Antofagasta</strong> dropped 44p to 958p. <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> fell 129.5p to \u00a329.13 and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> dropped 58.5p to 1942.5.</p> <p>But with gold and silver edging up as buyers sought safer investments, precious metal miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> bucked the trend, up 4p at \u00a310.80.</p> <p><strong>Arm</strong> slipped 55p to 995p. The chipmaker has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2013/may/22/arm-growth-worries-investor-day\" title=\"\">under pressure since an investor day on Tuesday</a>, with analysts concerned about increased competition from Intel in the tablet and smartphone markets. Many believe a move by Arm into the server sector may not be enough to make up for any loss of market share elsewhere.</p> <p>Exane BNP Paribas was the latest to issue a cautious note, moving its recommendation from outperform to neutral.</p> <p><strong>GKN</strong>, which also gave a presentation to analysts and investors on Tuesday, was also under the cosh, down 12.7p at 299.2p.</p> <p><strong>Vodafone </strong>fell 3.25p to 193.55p as analysts continued to discuss the fate of its stake in US joint venture Verizon Wireless. Will Draper at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> We believe [partner] Verizon is closer than ever to making a formal bid for Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless. In our view, Vodafone should agree to sell if it can agree a price above the net present value of the dividends it may otherwise expect to receive from Verizon Wireless i.e. \u00a380bn or $122bn. We believe monetizing its investment in this way is potentially the greatest source of near-term value for Vodafone's shareholders and would give the company many more options for investment to improve its competitive position in Europe, as well as allow a significant cash return. We increase our fair value on Vodafone to 220p from 200p, reducing the minority discount on our valuation of the Verizone Wireless stake, and reiterate our buy recommendation. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>Halfords</strong> slumped nearly 16% to 333.3p after it revealed a plan to cut its payments to shareholders to help fund a three-year turnaround plan. It is cutting its final dividend by 35% to 9.1p taking the total to 17.1p. It plans to rebase the payment to around 14p a share over the medium term.</p> <p>Chief executive Matt Davies said he would invest \u00a3100m to improve its stores and online business, train staff and introduce new cycle ranges. Profits for the year fell from \u00a392.2m to \u00a372m. Analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> The new Halfords three-year plan of chief executive Matt Davies has the catchy title of \"Getting into Gear 2016\", but an alternative title might have been \"The Duke of York Approach\" (\"march profits down to the bottom of the cycle and then march them up again\") and it will be interesting to hear how shareholders react to the news that profits will fall further this year, will be no higher in 2016 than they were in 2012/13 and that the dividend has been \"rebased\", i.e. cut... <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Qinetiq</strong>, the defence technology company spun out of the Ministry of Defence, fell 5.8p to 198p as full year underlying profits rose 6% to \u00a3152m, with a positive performance from its UK services business. But defence budgets are under pressure worldwide, with possible contract delays and modifications, especially in the US, where Qinetiq's services business saw profits fall from \u00a332m to \u00a329m. After a \u00a3256m writedown on the American division, Qinetiq is considering the future of the business, which could lead to its sale.</p> <p><strong>St James Place</strong> lost 67p to 573p after <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> raised \u00a3450m by selling 15% of the wealth management group. Lloyds, down 2.34p at 60.62p, said the shares had been placed at 580p a share, and it was retaining a 21% stake.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Flybe</strong> flew 2% higher to 57.25p as it clinched an expected deal to sell its 25 take-off and landing slots at London's Gatwick airport to <strong>easyJet</strong>, down 19p at \u00a312.66, for \u00a320m. Flybe also pushed back the delivery of 16 aircraft to help it return to profitability and said it had axed 590 jobs, or 22% of the workforce.</p> <p>Finally pharmaceutical group <strong>BTG</strong> added 1.1p to 339.5p despite placing 32m shares at 330p each to raise \u00a3106m before expenses. The funds will be used to help pay for two acquisitions, the purchases of the targeted therapies division of Nordion for $200m and Ekos, a specialist in blood clot treatment, for up to \u00a3220m. Dr Paul Cuddon at Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote> The investment case for BTG had started to become stale, with Zytiga now growing in line with forecasts and Varisolve peak sales potential the difference between buyers and holders. In deploying \u00a3253m in firepower with a 10% placing, BTG has assembled a world-leading interventional medicine business with significant growth potential as therapies and medical devices become increasingly targeted. </blockquote>",

United Utilities added 6p to 787.5p after the water company said it would raise its final dividend by 7.2% despite a 9.3% fall in full year profits, which was due to a decrease in deferred taxation credit. Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital said the numbers were in line with market expectations: Underlying operating profit came in at \u00a3607m, underlying PBT came in at \u00a3354m \u2013 both broadly in line with consensus. [It remains] on track or ahead of schedule in meeting its 5-year regulatory outperformance targets. Sweeteners group Tate and Lyle rose 14p to 871p while J Sainsbury edged up 0.3p to 382.3p, both deemed to be havens for investors. Overall though, markets were on the slide following weaker than expected Chinese factory data, which raised fears of a slowdown in the country's economy, and confusion over the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing plans. The recent market surge, with the FTSE 100 coming within 90 points of its all time high on Wednesday, has been partly driven by stimulus measures from the central banks designed to boost the global economy. So comments from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke about a possible easing of its $85bn a month bond buying programme unsettled investors, and this was later compounded by the Fed's latest minutes which showed that some members thought such a move could come as soon as June. Stronger than forecast US weekly jobless claims added more fuel to the idea of a pause in the programme. Also hitting sentiment was the news that the HSBC index of Chinese manufacturing had fallen below 50 for the first time since October, signalling contraction, which helped send the Nikkei down 7% overnight and pushed Japanese bond yields higher. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said: Taken in isolation, the Ben Bernanke speech, the Fed minutes and the China data would probably only have a limited impact, but having come all at once investors are finding it hard to be particularly sanguine. That said, even if this does turn into a sustained down move over a period of a week or two, the fundamental narrative of central bank easing and improving economic data should reassert itself. So the FTSE 100 finished down 143.48 points at 6696.79, a 2.1% decline which marks its worst daily performance since exactly a year ago. With the weak Chinese data, mining shares were among the biggest fallers. Anglo American lost 83.5p to \u00a315.70p while Antofagasta dropped 44p to 958p. Rio Tinto fell 129.5p to \u00a329.13 and BHP Billiton dropped 58.5p to 1942.5. But with gold and silver edging up as buyers sought safer investments, precious metal miner Fresnillo bucked the trend, up 4p at \u00a310.80. Arm slipped 55p to 995p. The chipmaker has been under pressure since an investor day on Tuesday, with analysts concerned about increased competition from Intel in the tablet and smartphone markets. Many believe a move by Arm into the server sector may not be enough to make up for any loss of market share elsewhere. Exane BNP Paribas was the latest to issue a cautious note, moving its recommendation from outperform to neutral. GKN, which also gave a presentation to analysts and investors on Tuesday, was also under the cosh, down 12.7p at 299.2p. Vodafone fell 3.25p to 193.55p as analysts continued to discuss the fate of its stake in US joint venture Verizon Wireless. Will Draper at Espirito Santo said: We believe [partner] Verizon is closer than ever to making a formal bid for Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless. In our view, Vodafone should agree to sell if it can agree a price above the net present value of the dividends it may otherwise expect to receive from Verizon Wireless i.e. \u00a380bn or $122bn. We believe monetizing its investment in this way is potentially the greatest source of near-term value for Vodafone's shareholders and would give the company many more options for investment to improve its competitive position in Europe, as well as allow a significant cash return. We increase our fair value on Vodafone to 220p from 200p, reducing the minority discount on our valuation of the Verizone Wireless stake, and reiterate our buy recommendation. Among the mid-caps, Halfords slumped nearly 16% to 333.3p after it revealed a plan to cut its payments to shareholders to help fund a three-year turnaround plan. It is cutting its final dividend by 35% to 9.1p taking the total to 17.1p. It plans to rebase the payment to around 14p a share over the medium term. Chief executive Matt Davies said he would invest \u00a3100m to improve its stores and online business, train staff and introduce new cycle ranges. Profits for the year fell from \u00a392.2m to \u00a372m. Analyst Nick Bubb said: The new Halfords three-year plan of chief executive Matt Davies has the catchy title of \"Getting into Gear 2016\", but an alternative title might have been \"The Duke of York Approach\" (\"march profits down to the bottom of the cycle and then march them up again\") and it will be interesting to hear how shareholders react to the news that profits will fall further this year, will be no higher in 2016 than they were in 2012/13 and that the dividend has been \"rebased\", i.e. cut... Qinetiq, the defence technology company spun out of the Ministry of Defence, fell 5.8p to 198p as full year underlying profits rose 6% to \u00a3152m, with a positive performance from its UK services business. But defence budgets are under pressure worldwide, with possible contract delays and modifications, especially in the US, where Qinetiq's services business saw profits fall from \u00a332m to \u00a329m. After a \u00a3256m writedown on the American division, Qinetiq is considering the future of the business, which could lead to its sale. St James Place lost 67p to 573p after Lloyds Banking Group raised \u00a3450m by selling 15% of the wealth management group. Lloyds, down 2.34p at 60.62p, said the shares had been placed at 580p a share, and it was retaining a 21% stake. Elsewhere Flybe flew 2% higher to 57.25p as it clinched an expected deal to sell its 25 take-off and landing slots at London's Gatwick airport to easyJet, down 19p at \u00a312.66, for \u00a320m. Flybe also pushed back the delivery of 16 aircraft to help it return to profitability and said it had axed 590 jobs, or 22% of the workforce. Finally pharmaceutical group BTG added 1.1p to 339.5p despite placing 32m shares at 330p each to raise \u00a3106m before expenses. The funds will be used to help pay for two acquisitions, the purchases of the targeted therapies division of Nordion for $200m and Ekos, a specialist in blood clot treatment, for up to \u00a3220m. Dr Paul Cuddon at Peel Hunt said: The investment case for BTG had started to become stale, with Zytiga now growing in line with forecasts and Varisolve peak sales potential the difference between buyers and holders. In deploying \u00a3253m in firepower with a 10% placing, BTG has assembled a world-leading interventional medicine business with significant growth potential as therapies and medical devices become increasingly targeted.",

      "bodyText": "BT chief executive Ian Livingston's annual earnings have risen to \u00a38.5m, boosted by a rise in the company's share price which will also see 1,000 managers share windfall payouts averaging \u00a3120,000. Having overseen a 50% rise in BT's market value in the last year, Livingston has been granted shares worth \u00a36m from the scheme, which was designed as a reward for a three-year turnaround plan. His managers have received \u00a3120m from the pot of 38m shares, which was distributed following annual results last week. \"BT's remuneration policy is based on reward for success,\" a spokesman said. \"The company has more than one million shareholders and they have benefited from healthy dividends, as well as a share price which has more than doubled over three years.\" Livingston's bonus and the number of shares awarded were lower than last year, but because of the increase in BT's share price, his overall package has risen from the previous \u00a37.7m total. He waived a pay rise for the second year in a row, taking home a base salary of \u00a3925,000, although his cash in lieu of pension contributions has risen to \u00a3270,000, \u00a350,000 more than last year. The chief executive's cash bonus was \u00a31.196m, effectively equal to his salary plus pension money, and he received a further \u00a321,000 in other benefits which range from a company car to home security. In addition, if Livingston is still chief executive of BT in three years, he will take possession of shares worth more than \u00a32m at current prices. BT will adopt government proposals on executive pay in 2014. These include binding shareholder votes and publishing a single figure for each executive's total pay. The firm's remuneration committee is chaired by former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt, who receives \u00a3160,000 a year for being a BT board member. \"Executive remuneration remains a lively and often controversial issue,\" she wrote in the annual report, published on Thursday. \"The committee has kept closely in touch with developments, recognising that this is a key issue for investors, employees and other stakeholders.\" During his tenure, Livingston has initiated a \u00a32.5bn investment to replace copper broadband lines with fibre cables, serving two thirds of the UK population by 2014. Earlier this month, the company kicked off what analysts expect will be a pay TV price war by launching two sports channels that will broadcast Premier League games free to those customers who already take BT broadband. The move has boosted BT's shares, while denting those of rival pay TV companies BSkyB and TalkTalk. Livingston has also tackled BT's ballooning pension deficit, and kept costs under control at its global services division, which secures telecoms contracts from government organisations and large companies. When Livingston joined in June 2008, global services was in trouble after signing too many unprofitable contracts. By March 2009, it had plunged to a \u00a32bn operating loss. The division is still on a knife edge, but managed to report a \u00a33m profit this year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With Europe's markets closed, it's time to wrap up. My colleague Nick Fletcher has rounded up the action: Leading shares have fallen sharply from their recent 13-year highs, as investors took fright at weak Chinese manufacturing data and concerns that the US Federal Reserve might end its bond-buying programme sooner than expected. A day after the FTSE 100 came within 90 points of its December 1999 peak, the index slumped 2.1%, down 143.48 points at 6696.79. This is its worst daily performance in percentage terms since exactly a year ago. But after its recent strong surge, this latest fall merely wipes out the gains made since Friday. Overnight the the Nikkei 225 dropped more than 7% to 14,483.98 in the wake of a Chinese survey showing factory activity had fallen for the first time in seven months in May. In early trading on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply initially but had recovered most of its losses by the London market close. \u2022 Nick's full story is here: FTSE 100 falls sharply from 13-year high \u2022 The closing market prices are here: \u2022 Market reaction is here \u2022 Economics editor Larry Elliott's analysis is here \u2022 And you can follow all the action, starting with Japan's plunge, here Thanks for following, and goodnight! GW And here's a graph of the FTSE 100 over the last three months Today's 143-point fall wipes out just a small portion of the recent rally. Just five companies on the FTSE 100 finished the day higher, while the biggest fallers lost over 5% as the main index finished 2.1% lower. Here's two charts showing the biggest risers: And the biggest fallers: The Economist has now uploaded its latest edition to its website, including a blast at European leaders for their complacency to the crisis: With a credit crunch grumbling on in Southern Europe, European banks in need of more capital, and no clear plan for growth, the lack of urgency in Brussels is a sign of \"decay\", it claims. Here's its conclusion: And if euro-zone leaders stumble on? Like Japan, Europe will be under a shadow for years to come. The cost will be measured in disillusion, blighted communities and wasted lives. Unlike Japan, though, the euro zone is not cohesive. For as long as stagnation and recession tear at democracy, the euro zone risks a fatal popular rejection. If the sleepwalkers care about their currency and their people, they need to wake up. More here. Here are the thoughts of some City analysts and traders on today's selloff in Europe (see 4.45pm for the closing prices), following the Japanese tumble. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets When European markets opened this morning you could be forgiven for hearing a loud hissing sound as the air drained out of the strong rally we\u2019ve seen unfold since the beginning of this month. This morning\u2019s sharp drop on the Nikkei was certainly one catalyst, but it certainly wasn\u2019t the only one as we saw the Japanese index plunge sharply in a fall that saw every constituent in the index close lower, the first time that this has happened since 2005. Whatever the catalysts behind today\u2019s equity market sell-off they need to be put into the context of how far markets have risen this year. Since November last year the Nikkei has almost doubled in value so a 7% decline while significant, still leaves us much higher than when we started the year. Rupert Osborne, futures dealer at IG It is time to pull out the term \u2018a sea of red\u2019 to describe the day\u2019s market action. It has been quite a while since we\u2019ve able to describe a market in this way, but the snowballing of selling that has characterised today aptly fits the description. European markets have taken one look at the Chinese PMI and the Fed minutes and have decided that they do not like them one little bit. However, now is the time for rational heads to prevail. A sober look at the market action today shows that we are still up 13% for the year; given that the average performance for the year as a whole within the period 1984-2012 is 7.4%, investors could walk away from this market for the rest of 2013 and still be pleased with their performance. Even with a 2.4% decline today we are only back to levels seen last Friday. In the context of a rally that has powered higher since late Autumn 2012, the loss of a week\u2019s gains is small beer. Julian Jessop of Capital Economics: The weakness in global equity markets since the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday backs our view that the rally had become overly dependent on expectations of further support from monetary policy. To recap, the FOMC minutes revealed that \u201cdespite some softness in recent economic data\u201d, \u201ca number\u201d of Fed officials \u201cexpressed willingness to adjust the flow of purchases downward as early as the June meeting\u201d. Judging by the most recent comments from Bernanke that the reduction could happen in the \u201cnext few meetings\u201d, we still think that the FOMC is more likely to wait until its mid-September meeting. Either way, though, we continue to expect the Fed to scale back its asset purchases later this year and perhaps halt them completely early in 2014. The main casualty on Thursday was the Nikkei. We began the week by predicting a correction of around 15% in Japanese equities over the remainder of the year. In the event, almost half that fall happened in a single day, with the Nikkei closing down 1,143 points at 14,484 (a decline of 7.3%). Viewed in the least unfavourable light, the slump in the Nikkei could be seen simply as a temporary correction in what has otherwise been an exceptionally strong rally... Putting Thursday\u2019s move in perspective, the Nikkei has still gained around 67% since November. Government sovereign debt also fell in value across Europe today, pushing up bond yields - the effective rate of interest paid on the debt. Here's a selection of 10-year bond yields this evening: \u2022 UK: 1.91%, up 0.01 percentage point (ie, up from 1.9%) \u2022 Germany: 1.4%, up 0.01pp \u2022 France: 1.82%, up 0.04pp \u2022 Spain: 4.28%, up 0.14pp \u2022 Italy: 4.02%, up 0.1pp \u2022 Greece: 8.7%, up 0.68pp (lower numbers = lower borrowing costs). The US stock market, though, is not joining in the selloff which began overnight in Japan and rippled around the globe. Almost halfway through the trading day, the Dow Jones index has just moved into positive territory - up 15 points at 15323. It takes more than a 7.3% plunge on the Nikkei to give Wall Street the shivers.... It's official -- the FTSE 100 has tumbled by 2.1%, which my colleague Nick Fletcher tells me is the biggest fall, in percentage terms, in 12 months. Here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 143 points at 6696. -2.1% \u2022 German DAX: down 178 points at 8351, -2.1% \u2022 French CAC: down 84 points at 3966, -2.1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 118 points at 8343, -1.4% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 537 points at 17008, -3% Reaction to follow.... Europe's stock markets have closed, with heavy losses across the board. It will take a few minutes for the closing auction in London to be concluded, but right now we're looking at falls of 2% or more on most exchanges -- the worst day's trading in months.... However, over on Wall Street the Dow Jones is recovering - and is now down just 23 points (so under 0.2%). Kenneth Rogoff, the Harvard economist, argues today that it's time for France to start pulling its weight in Europe. He writes: All eyes may be on Germany, but today it is really France that will play the central role in deciding the euro's fate. Germany cannot carry the euro on its shoulders alone indefinitely. France needs to become a second anchor of growth and stability. Temporary Keynesian demand measures may help to sustain short-run internal growth, but they will not solve France's long-run competitiveness problems. At the same time, France and Germany must both come to terms with an approach that leads to far greater political union within a couple of decades. Otherwise, the coming banking union and fiscal transfers will lack the necessary political legitimacy. Rogoff last hit the headlines after a grad student found errors in a paper he co-authored into the impact of high debts on growth. My colleague Joris Luyendijk has interviewed a product controller at a City firm for his Banking Blog, which focuses on the people who work in our financial sector. Interesting stuff as ever -- today's interviewee explains how some of the City stereotypes are quite off-beam, and also speaks about the issue of rogue trading. Here's a flavour: Rogue traders are people who made a mistake or lost money, then tried to cover that up. Truth is that the scale and complexity of a major bank's trading operation makes for opportunities. Every trader runs one or more so-called 'books' with all his trades. But when a trader leaves for another job, the book usually stays on the system. So you have thousands of old books from traders who stopped years ago. Somebody with intimate knowledge of the systems might try to squirrel away some trades. Another way is to cancel and rebook a trade every few days so it never gets processed properly, and flagged up. More here: Product controller: 'If you've been there for a while, it becomes harder to suddenly say: by the way, I am gay' This week's Economist, due out tomorrow, blasts Europe's leaders for the handling of the eurozone crisis. They helpfully tweeted the front page: Guess we'll find out more tomorrow.... A recap for anyone just joining us...Europe's stock markets have posted heavy losses through the day, following a remarkable day's trading in Japan where its Nikkei index fell 7%, the biggest fall since the huge earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. The Japanese selloff was blamed on a few factors -- including \u2022 surprisingly weak factory data from China overnight, showing the first fall in output for eight months. \u2022 the latest minutes from the US Federal Reserve which revealed some policy makers would like to start slowing its stimulus package soon. In London the FTSE 100 is on track for its biggest daily fall in almost a year, currently down 158 points at 6682. Most European markets are down by more than 2% as well, while on Wall Street the major indices are down between 0.5% and 1%. It's not a crash, or a rout, with many analysts pointing out that stock markets have been climbing steadily for months. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, argues that today's events show that the markets are hooked on stimulus. Central banks may well be inflating the biggest financial bubble the world has ever seen, the popping of which would trigger a second global slump, but they are convinced they know what they are doing. Extra liquidity, they believe, will feed through into higher business and consumer confidence through a wealth effect, and this will put the global economy on a stronger growth path. Given the choice, they prefer to have the problem of having asset prices going through the roof rather than the problem of deflation. If they are wrong and the bubble bursts before the recovery arrives it will be the mother of all credit busts. Eurozone consumers remains very gloomy, a survey by the European Commission just released shows. The EC's consumer confidence index came in at -21.9 this month, slightly better than April's -22.3. Not enough to cheer traders, though. Meanwhile in America some decent housing data just hit the wires. New home sales were up 2.3% To 454,000, beating forecasts. And further - FTSE 100 down 170 points.... And the FTSE 100 falls further, off 140 points at 6699. The opening bell has been rung on Wall Street, and shares are falling. But it's not a rout. The Dow Jones index is down 89 points, or 0.6%, in early trading. The Nasdaq index is showing the biggest losses, down 1.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 fell almost 0.9%. More data -- growth in the US manufacturing sector has slowed this month. Markit's monthly manufacturing PMI came in at 51.9, down from April's 52.1. So the sector still expanded, but at a slower rate [anything above 50 points means growth]. On the upside, the reading is slightly better than expected. Not much reaction in the markets, where the FTSE 100 is currently down 132 points, or almost 2%, at 6708 after six hours of trading. CNBC's Kelly Evans agrees that today's US jobless data (see 1.40pm) will encourage those who think the Federal Reserve will start to slow its electronic money-printing programme soon. Just in: the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefit fell to 340,000 last week, down from 363,000 the week before. That's a slightly larger drop than expected. The number of people with 'continued claims' (rather than signing on for the first time), dropped to 2.912m, the lowest level since March 2008. This may show the US labour market is continuing to recover. Which is one of the yardsticks which the Federal Reserve will use when deciding whether to turn off the stimulus taps.... Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, predicts that today's stock market tumble is not the start of a rout. Ben Bernanke of the Fed will ensure that there's enough liquidity to keep the markets happy, he writes, even if that increases the chances of an almighty bust in the long term: After such a strong rise in recent months, some correction has always been inevitable. The real question, however, is whether this is a pause for breath or the start of something more serious \u2013 a crash of the sort seen in the early 2000s or during the Great Recession of 2007-09. Almost certainly, it will be the former. Central banks may well be inflating the biggest financial bubble the world has ever seen, the popping of which would trigger a second global slump, but they are convinced they know what they are doing. Extra liquidity, they believe, will feed through into higher business and consumer confidence through a wealth effect, and this will put the global economy on a stronger growth path. Given the choice, they prefer to have the problem of having asset prices going through the roof rather than the problem of deflation. If they are wrong and the bubble bursts before the recovery arrives it will be the mother of all credit busts. Stock market crash or a pause for breath? The US stock market is expected to drop around 0.5% when trading begins, at 2.30pm BST. Europe's stock markets remain deep in the red this lunchtime, although most markets have risen a little of their morning lows: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 124 points at 6716, -1.8% \u2022 German DAX: down 197 at 8333, -2.3% \u2022 French CAC: down 83 at 3967, -2.07% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 124 at 8339, -1.5% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 433 points at 17112, -2.5% The prospect of the US Fed slowing its bond-buying programme (which currently puts $85bn into the economy each month) is still being blamed for alarming traders. Even though Ben Bernanke told the US Congress yesterday that he didn't expect to start 'tapering' the programme anytime soon. Bryce Elder sums it up on FT Alphaville's Market's Live chat BE: It seems to be that Ben said: \u201cThe free bar\u2019s still open. You don\u2019t have to sober up yet.\u201d BE: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet when you\u2019ll begin to sober up, but we\u2019ll probably decide within the next few months when we intend to close the bar.\u201d BE: Why\u2019s this a surprise? It isn\u2019t. Why\u2019s the market wetting its pants? Because it\u2019s drunk. Another senior Japanese politician has argued that today's 7% tumble on the Nikkei was a short-term move, not a sign of panic. Yasutoshi Nishimura, senior vice-minister of the Cabinet Office, told Reuters: It's a temporary adjustment after the rapid gains seen recently adding that the surge in stock prices since last autumn \"was not a bubble\". Japanese bond prices have recovered slightly this morning. At one stage the yield on 10-year government debt was above 1% as investors sold up, but it's currently back at around 0.83%. Wall Street is expected to open lower this afternoon, but the future market suggests it will not be a rout. Bloomberg suggests the S&amp;P 500 will open around 1% lower: Ireland's prime minister, Enda Kenny, is visiting Athens today for talks with his Greek opposite number, Antonis Samaras. On the agenda, the European economy, and how Ireland should best use its remaining few weeks with the EU presidency. The two leaders held a press conference a little while ago, where Samaras said Greece would follow the example of Ireland to exit its crisis. Eurocrisis expert Yannis Koutsomitis tweets more highlights: Mixed economic data from Italy this morning, where retail sales fell by 0.3% month-on-month in March. It's the fourth consecutive monthly drop, meaning sales were 3% lower than in March 2012. And as the figures aren't adjusted for inflation, the amount of goods bought probably fell by more. Businesses are worried. Giorgio Squinzi, head of employers body Confindustria warned this morning that Italian growth will struggle to rise above 0.5% for a \"long time\" without significant action by the government. But in a more encouraging sign, Italy has posted a trade surplus of \u20ac1.46bn in April, up from a deficit of \u20ac900m a year ago. Imports fell by almost \u20ac1.5bn to \u20ac13.2bn, while exports were up \u20ac900m to \u20ac14.7bn. The Japanese government says it is not alarmed by today's market moves, with several minister and officials saying its economic recovery is on track. Economy minister Akira Amari blamed the selloff on this morning's drop in Chinese factory output, saying: I thought the pace of the Nikkei's rise recently was faster than expected. The weak Chinese data prompted investors to take profits all at the same time. Amari added that the Tokyo government remained committed to \"Abenomics\", its broad stimulus programme to dramatically expand the money supply and push inflation higher. Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference that the government is still confident: Japan's economy is expected to gradually head for a recovery, and we hope to closely watch market developments. And vice finance minister Shunichi Yamaguchi said he will calmly and closely monitor market moves. Volatility is up sharply in Europe today, Reuters flags up: The Euro STOXX 50 Volatility Index surged 18% to a 3-week high on Thursday, as weak Chinese macro data and worries the U.S. Federal Reserve could soon trim its stimulus measures dented investors' appetite for risk. Europe's widely-used measure of investor risk aversion known as the VSTOXX - which is based on put and call options on Euro STOXX 50 stocks .STOXX50E - jumped to 19.27 on Thursday, while the Euro STOXX 50 index dropped 2.4% - its biggest slide in nearly three months. While shares drop, the yen has pushed up to a two-week high against the dollar and the euro. At 101.5 yen to the dollar, the Japanese currency remains weak -- having dropped steadily in value as the Tokyo government pushed on with efforts to stimulate growth: Jane Foley, Rabobank's currency expert, point out that the huge gains in Japan\u2019s stock markets were largely built on hope: While there has been lots of substance in the policy changes announced by the BoJ and the new government, Japanese economic data is yet to throw up firm evidence that the economy is emerging from its multi-decade slumber. Despite the sharp falls in the value of the yen over the past 6 mths, yesterday\u2019s release of Japanese April trade data showed a disappointingly slow pace of export growth (3.8% y/y). Also in April nationwide department stores sales dropped -0.5% y/y while the consumer confidence index slipped back to 44.5 from 44.8 a month before. While the Japanese authorities\u2019 attempts to stimulate growth have generally been greeted with encouragement overseas, their successes will clearly be tempered by slowing growth in China, by recession in the Eurozone and by the lacklustre recovery in the US as well as their own progress in implemented difficult structural reforms. The 7.3% drop on the Nikkei today was driven by small investors rather than institutions, the Financial Times is reporting. Here's their latest piece from Toyko: Small investors lead Japan share exodus Unlike the rout of two years ago, which was led by institutional investors fearing a nuclear meltdown, brokers said that Thursday\u2019s dash for the exits was led by retail \u2013 or smaller \u2013 investors. Over the past few weeks, individual investors\u2019 share of trading had risen steadily, to a record 35% cent last week. Brokers say their share was almost certainly higher over the past few days, judging by huge volumes in popular stocks such as Fast Retailing, owner of Uniqlo, and Mitsubishi Motors. While retail investors were taking the opportunity to bag some profits, brokers report that many institutions remained on the sidelines, trimming positions rather than dumping them altogether. Back in the financial markets, shares remain in retreat across Europe. Several of the big indices are down over 2%, and the FTSE 100 is hitting new lows for the day as I type. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 130 points at 6709, -1.9% \u2022 German DAX: down 221 at 8309, -2.6% \u2022 French CAC: down 103 at 3950, -2.5% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 167 at 8295, -2.0% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 486 points at 17059, -2.78% These big falls follow months of steadily rising share prices -- with shares in London hitting new 13-year highs in recent days. In fact, the FTSE 100 is only at a one-week low now. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers said that \"giddy\" investors have been happy to take profits today. By way of perspective, it is not necessarily negative that some pressure should be taken out of the tyres. Even factoring in today\u2019s drop, the FTSE100 remains up 13.8% in the year to date, whilst nothing material has changed overnight. Monetary policy is still accommodative, corporate earnings have maintained their positive trend and in terms of yield, equities arguably remain the asset class of choice. The Office for National Statistics has confirmed that the UK economy grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of this year, as it initially estimated last month. The service sector grew by 0.6%, production industries expanded by 0.2%, but construction was down by 2.4% -- all in line with the first reading of GDP. The eurozone private sector is still shrinking, according to data firm Markit's latest survey. Its composite survey of companies across the region came in at 47.7, which shows another drop in activity. Better than April's 46.9, but still well into contractionary territory. The data suggests that the eurozone's recession won't end this quarter: But Martin van Vliet of ING is hopeful that the downturn will end this year: The preliminary PMI figures for May provide a glimmer of hope amid the gloom surrounding the Eurozone economy and makes another ECB rate cut in June less likely. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index just closed 2.5% lower, its biggest daily fall in seven weeks. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, is appearing in a special French court this morning to answer questions over a controversial deal made by France's government five years ago, when she was finance minister. The special court is examining whether Lagarde broke the law by authorising a private arbitration and an out-of court settlement with businessman Bernard Tapie. Tapie received a \u20ac400m payout from the French taxpayer to settle a court case brought against Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais over the botched sale of Adidas in the 1990s. Lagarde denies any wrongdoing over the deal, and is keen to clear her name. As our correspondent in Paris, Angelique Chrisafis, wrote: Together, the odd couple of Christine Lagarde and Bernard Tapie are at the centre of a legal investigation into alleged complicity in embezzlement of public funds and abuse of power over a multimillion euro state payout that could expose the unhealthy friendships between high French politics and the world of business.... \"Do I look like the sort of person to be pally with Tapie?\" the haughty Lagarde has said of the case. More here: Christine Lagarde jets back to Paris to be questioned over Tapie payout Germany's private sector is effectively stagnant this month, according to new data that confirms the eurozone economy is still in trouble. The Markit Composite PMI, which measures activity across the German economy, came in at 49.9, up from 49.2 in April (where a 50-point reading separates expansion from contraction) German manufacturing output rose slightly, but was balanced out by a small drop in services. And France's private sector kept shrinking, with a composite PMI of 44.3 -- a long way from that 50-point mark. The Japanese stock market had surged around 50% during 2013, so it's not a shock to see shares falling today (although the size of the plunge is quite a surprise). Investors have welcomed prime minister Abe's determination to slay deflation through a huge stimulus programme. Today's rout actually only takes the Nikkei back to levels seen earlier this month, as this graph shows: Linda Yueh, the BBC's chief business correspondent, reckons that many Japanese investors were keen to bank their recent profits: Here's some early comment on the selloff from Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor: When the FTSE had achieved such heady levels, the inevitable consequence was always going to be the size of the drop when a correction took place. Yesterday the London index came within 75 points of the all time high and managed its second highest close in history, but traders are looking at a bit of a blood bath as Thursday's session gets underway and screens are quite literally a sea of red. McCudden says the inconsistent message from the Federal Reserve over when to slow its monetary stimulus programme (see 8.27am) started the jitters in Japan. The surprise fall in Chinese factory activity (see 7.58am) compounded it. He added: Whether this marks the beginning of the correction, or whether the bulls dust themselves down for another go remains to be seen, but it appear inevitable that we're going to see more of the same in the months ahead. After the opening flurry of selling, the FTSE 100 is fluctuating around a 100-point loss, at 6735. That's a fall of around 1.5%. It's looking volatile too.... Speculation that the Federal Reserve might slow its stimulus package this summer is also hitting shares hard today. Minutes from the Fed's last meeting, released last night, show that several members of its monetary policy committee favour slowing its quantitative easing bond-buying programme in June. Forbes describes the situation as \"a mad house\", with hawks and doves split over what to do: Tectonic plates are shifting within the Fed\u2019 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as hawks and doves battle it out over QE..... Adding to the debate, participants also spoke of \u201cbuoyant\u201d markets as a bubble could be in the works, while others warned of the risks of deflation and pushed for more QE. Every single share on the FTSE 100 has fallen this morning. Chip company ARM is the biggest faller (down over 6%), followed by mining giants Antofagasta and Anglo American. European markets are also falling heavily at the start of trading. \u2022 France's CAC: down 2.2% \u2022 Germany's DAX fell 1.9% \u2022 Spain's IBEX fell 2.3%, \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB fell 2.5% Big falls, but not as dramatic as the 7% drop in Japan overnight. The FTSE 100 has tumbled 120 points at the start of trading, a fall of over 1.6%. Also coming up today, we have manufacturing data from eurozone countries and the second estimate of UK GDP for the first quarter of this year. Plenty of opportunity to move the markets.... The price of copper has fallen by 3% this morning, to $7,250/tonne, following the news that China's factory activity shrank for the first time in seven months in May. The flash HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for May fell to 49.6, down from 50.4 in April. This is the first time since October 2012 that it has fallen below the 50-point mark, which shows if the sector grew or shrunk. Seven stocks tumbled by over 13% in Tokyo today, as this image shows: Good morning. The Japanese stock market has tumbled over 7% in a dramatic day's trading in Asia, and heavy losses are expected in Europe when the markets open. A roller coaster ride saw the Nikkei finish 7.3% lower at 14483, down 1143 points, having earlier hit its highest level since December 2007. It's the biggest daily fall on the Japanese stock market since March 2011, following the T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. The wild selloff was sparked by disappointing economic data from China -- where factory activity shrank for the first time in seven months. A fall in new orders reignited fears that Chinese economy is cooling. HSBC chief China economist Hongbin Qu warned that China\u2019s \"fragile growth recovery\u201d was at risk. Each of the 225 shares on the Nikkei index finished lower, with many \u2013 including Mitsubisho and Sharp \u2013 suffering double-digit losses. The panic in Japan has already been felt in other Asian market, with the Australian index dropping 2% and similar falls in Hong Kong and Seoul. Chris Weston of IG Index commented: Volatility is in full force today and nowhere more so than Japan. The Japanese stock market had been rallying for months, pumped up by Tokyo's unconventional monetary policy -- dramatically expanding its monetery base in an effort to fight inflation. Traders are braced for falls when the European markets open, with IG calling the FTSE 100 down 74 points earlier this morning. I'll be tracking all the action through the day.",

Since November last year the Nikkei has almost doubled in value so a 7% decline while significant, still leaves us much higher than when we started the year.</p> <h2>Rupert Osborne, futures dealer at IG</h2> <p>It is time to pull out the term \u2018a sea of red\u2019 to describe the day\u2019s market action.</p> <p>It has been quite a while since we\u2019ve able to describe a market in this way, but the snowballing of selling that has characterised today aptly fits the description. European markets have taken one look at the Chinese PMI and the Fed minutes and have decided that they do not like them one little bit. However, now is the time for rational heads to prevail.</p> <p>A sober look at the market action today shows that we are still up 13% for the year; given that the average performance for the year as a whole within the period 1984-2012 is 7.4%, investors could walk away from this market for the rest of 2013 and still be pleased with their performance.</p> <p>Even with a 2.4% decline today we are only back to levels seen last Friday. In the context of a rally that has powered higher since late Autumn 2012, the loss of a week\u2019s gains is small beer.</p> <h2>Julian Jessop of Capital Economics:</h2> <p>The weakness in global equity markets since the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday backs our view that the rally had become overly dependent on expectations of further support from monetary policy.</p> <p>To recap, the FOMC minutes revealed that \u201cdespite some softness in recent economic data\u201d, \u201ca number\u201d of Fed officials \u201cexpressed willingness to adjust the flow of purchases downward as early as the June meeting\u201d. Judging by the most recent comments from Bernanke that the reduction could happen in the \u201cnext few meetings\u201d, we still think that the FOMC is more likely to wait until its mid-September meeting. Either way, though, we continue to expect the Fed to scale back its asset purchases later this year and perhaps halt them completely early in 2014.</p> <p>&#xa0;The main casualty on Thursday was the Nikkei. We began the week by predicting a correction of around 15% in Japanese equities over the remainder of the year. In the event, almost half that fall happened in a single day, with the Nikkei closing down 1,143 points at 14,484 (a decline of 7.3%).</p> <p>Viewed in the least unfavourable light, the slump in the Nikkei could be seen simply as a temporary correction in what has otherwise been an exceptionally strong rally...</p> <p>Putting Thursday\u2019s move in perspective, the Nikkei has still gained around 67% since November.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T17:01:07.749Z\">at 6.01pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-519e4489e4b0e3928886151c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T16:32:16.920Z\">5.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Government sovereign debt also fell in value across Europe today, pushing up bond yields - the effective rate of interest paid on the debt.</p> <p>Here's a selection of 10-year bond yields this evening:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>UK</strong>: 1.91%, up 0.01 percentage point (ie, up from 1.9%)</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Germany</strong>: 1.4%, up 0.01pp</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>France</strong>: 1.82%, up 0.04pp</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Spain</strong>: 4.28%, up 0.14pp</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Italy</strong>: 4.02%, up 0.1pp</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Greece</strong>: 8.7%, up 0.68pp</p> <p>(<em>lower numbers = lower borrowing costs</em>).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519e3f27e4b0371c681fa05a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T16:09:12.863Z\">5.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US stock market, though, is not joining in the selloff which began overnight in Japan and rippled around the globe.</p> <p>Almost halfway through the trading day, the Dow Jones index has just moved into positive territory - up 15 points at 15323.</p> <p>It takes more than a 7.3% plunge on the Nikkei to give Wall Street the shivers....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJones_IG/status/337599964505047043\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Dow +ve, normal service resumed.

There have only been a handful of occasions when declines have been seen equivalent to that overnight in Tokyo \u2013 the last of them following the tsunami two years ago. What is remarkable about the sell-off in the Nikkei, however, is not its size but the fact that it has been so long in coming. For the past year, financial markets have been in bullish mood \u2013 prices of shares, bonds and property have all been rising even though Europe is in a prolonged double-dip recession, the recovery in the United States has been poor by historic standards and China is losing momentum. But after relentlessly turning a blind eye to bad data, markets responded badly on Wednesday night to rising Japanese bond yields, a weak business survey from China and mixed messages from Washington about the future of quantitative easing. The reason markets have been rising has, of course, nothing to do with real economic conditions and everything to do with the willingness of central banks to print money. In effect, investors have been able to play in the casino with chips liberally provided by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and \u2013 more recently \u2013 the Bank of Japan. Unsurprisingly, they have been having a fine old time of it. After such a strong rise, some correction has always been inevitable. The real question, however, is whether this is a pause for breath or the start of something more serious \u2013 a crash of the sort seen in the early 2000s or during the great recession of 2007-09. Almost certainly, it will be the former. Central banks may well be inflating the biggest financial bubble the world has ever seen, the popping of which would trigger a second global slump, but they are convinced they know what they are doing. Extra liquidity, they believe, will feed through into higher business and consumer confidence through a wealth effect, and this will put the global economy on a stronger growth path. Given the choice, they prefer to have the problem of asset prices going through the roof than the problem of deflation. If they are wrong and the bubble bursts before the recovery arrives, it will be the mother of all credit busts. The central banks are now in a very tricky position. Financial markets are so hooked on the electronic money created through quantitative easing that they cannot cope without it. One of the reasons for Wednesday night's market tumble was the release of Fed minutes showing that some members of the bank's policy-making committee want to see a tapering in the pace of asset purchases. This ran counter to the testimony the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, gave to Congress on Wednesday, in which he made it clear that he wanted QE to continue at its current rate. Bernanke will win this argument. Following the example of his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, the current Fed chairman will ensure the provision of extra liquidity every time the financial markets take a major tumble. Bernanke is now locked into providing his version of the Greenspan put, whereby Wall Street knew that at some point the Fed would bail out investors with an easing of policy. In the short term, a commitment to keep the money taps full on will do the trick. Market corrections will be followed by soothing words and policy easing by central banks, and this will prompt further buying of assets. In the end, of course, this increases the chances of an almighty bust. That indeed looks likely. But not yet.",

      "bodyText": "Post Office workers have announced their fifth strike since Easter as they warned bosses not to \"plough blindly ahead\" with deeply unpopular plans to close 70 big high street branches. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said bosses had failed to listen to their concerns about the plans to franchise out 70 of the Post Office's 370 \"crown\" branches to retailers and the union had \"little choice\" but to walk out again on Tuesday 28 May. Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the CWU, said there was \"massive public opposition\" to the closure plans that will \"rip the heart out\" of the Post Office network. \"There is growing unrest within the Post Office and it's time that management responded to workers' concerns,\" he said. \"They cannot continue to plough blindly ahead with deeply unpopular and unnecessary plans.\" Ward said workers had been touched by the \"fantastic support from customers, politicians and local communities\". \"We're fighting to protect Post Office jobs and services, which are clearly valued,\" he said. The union's 4,000 crown post office members voted nine-to-one in favour of the full-day strike the day after the second May bank holiday. Staff have already held four strikes against the franchising plan since Easter Saturday, including one on the Tuesday after the first May bank holiday. The Post Office, which is state-owned and receiving \u00a31.3bn of taxpayer subsidy, said franchising out 70 of the crown branches was essential to securing the future of the service. Kevin Gilliland, the Post Office's sales director, has said the crown network of the biggest post offices across the country is \"losing \u00a340m a year of public money\" and \"must change the way they operate to ensure long term viability\". The CWU claims up to 800 Post Office jobs will be affected and staff are likely to receive inferior pay, pension and working conditions if they are transferred to retailers' books. The Post Office said it had offered crown network staff an \"extremely fair\" \u00a33,400 staged payment in recompense. The payment is worth about one sixth of an average Post Office employee's annual salary. The union said it had managed to secure a \u00a3100 payment for staff at its last meeting with management, but \"no progress was made on bigger issues\" of branch closures and a pay deal. Crown post offices represent just 3% of the nationwide network of 11,800 branches, but are generally the largest offices and handle 20% of all transactions and 40% of financial services sales, a key growth area for the Post Office. Six years ago 85 crown outlets were closed in the Post Office's last turnaround plan and 70 were moved into WH Smith stores. The Post Office has already received 150 expressions of interest from retailers keen to run post office services in their stores. Subject to a public consultation the crown branches will be transferred to the winning retailers before April 2015.
