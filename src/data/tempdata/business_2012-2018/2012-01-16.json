      "body": "<p>There is an air of refinement to the Bentley factory in Crewe. Timeless skills more akin to furniture making than automotive production remain at the heart of this elite British manufacturer. Yet even here there is evidence of the jarring changes that have yanked a once-parochial British car industry into the modern age.</p> <p>While many of the bespoke vehicles rolling off the slow, deliberative production line are destined for status-hungry members of the Chinese middle class, Bentley employees can be heard uttering Japanese phrases that were alien to automotive workers 30 years ago, but are now standard shopfloor lingo. In the woodshop, where door parts carved from walnut blocks are honed to a lacquered finish, an employee describes a <em>kaizen</em> technique, using the Japanese phrase for relentless improvement.</p> <p>A world-class British brand owned by a German manufacturer, benefitting from a production revolution started 6,000 miles away, and thriving on demand from the 21st century's coming economic power. This is a success story that epitomises the importance of exports to Britain's economic wellbeing, while banishing the memory of an industry that was in the doldrums 30 years ago, with a reputation for poor quality and dysfunctional industrial relations.</p> <p>Bentley's cars, which sell for \u00a3124,000 to \u00a3226,000, are produced under the ownership of its German parent, Volkswagen, but the UK industry owes its renaissance to Japan and <em>monozokuri</em>: the art of making things. One employee says Japanese production culture is embedded throughout the industry, adding: \"Why reinvent the wheel?\"</p> <p>In the UK mass production of cars was reinvented three decades ago. Nissan opened Britain's largest car plant in Sunderland in 1986, spearheading a revival that saw the UK industry make around 1.35m cars last year: a rise of about 6% on 2010. This is lower than the industry's peak of 1.9m in 1972, but the key statistic for the economy is where the cars end up: four decades ago a third of UK-made cars were exported. Now it is eight out of 10.</p> <p>The transformation is visible at the end of the production line for the Nissan Qashqai, known in the trade as a compact crossover SUV. At its start, anonymous steel plates are dragged into the maw of a giant pressing machine stamping out 22 car doors a minute. Then, in a process resembling a superorganism, parts travel through an automated chain of spark-firing weld robots and skilled workers fitting a dashboard every three seconds, and a perfectly formed vehicle trundles out every 60 seconds with its destination attached to the windshield. The acronyms that roll past underline the industry's export strength: USR for Russia, the factory's biggest market; UKR for Ukraine; TKY for Turkey and MOR for Morocco.</p> <p>Nissan's senior vice-president for manufacturing in Europe, Trevor Mann, says Britain is an appealing base for foreign manufacturers. The top five UK\u2011based carmakers in 2010 \u2013 all foreign-owned \u2013 were: Nissan, leading the way with 423,000 vehicles; BMW-owned Mini in Cowley; Indian-owned Land Rover in the Midlands; Japan's Honda in Swindon; and the largest Japanese auto company, Toyota, in Derby.</p> <p>As a premium brand, Bentley is a niche player, but it saw sales rise 37% last year as it sold more than 7,000 vehicles. According to Mann, Britain benefits from a strong domestic market, a skilled and flexible workforce, and a happy accident of geography.</p> <p>\"The UK is a competitive manufacturing country at the moment,\" said Mann. \"We are a small island, we are close to the sea \u2013 and the cheapest way to ship things around Europe is by sea. In Sunderland one of the key advantages is we are only three miles from a deep sea port and have good access to Russia, the Middle East and northern Europe.\"</p> <p>Carmakers are leading the economic rebalancing that the UK must undergo because Britons consume too much and manufacture too little. In 2010 the UK imported more goods and services than it exported by a margin of \u00a341bn worth; by making more things that are consumed abroad, rather than by indebted UK households, Britain's current account gains credit. Unwittingly, car manufacturing appears to be leading this transformation after the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) revealed domestic sales fell by 4.4% last year. This week it will reveal that production, on the other hand, surged.</p> <p>\"A lot of the UK's economic problems came from too much spending and borrowing by households and government,\" said Lee Hopley, chief economist at the UK manufacturers' organisation, the EEF. \"We can't rely on either of those for growth in the future. So in terms of where growth will come from, and the parts of the economy that will generate tax revenues and employment, investment in export-driven sectors will be key.\"</p> <p>According to HM Revenue &amp; Customs, in the first 10 months of last year road vehicles were second only to petroleum in the UK export market, generating \u00a322.4bn. It is Britain's largest manufactured export industry. But Bentley's head of manufacturing, Michael Straughan, warns there will not be another production boom like the one set off by Nissan decades ago.</p> <p>\"It is really important that we protect what we have got; that the likes of Honda, Nissan and Toyota stay here, and we encourage Jaguar Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Mini. We are not going to see a 1980s-style transplant of Japanese factories into the UK again.\"</p> <p>The SMMT's chief executive, Paul Everitt, agrees. \"We cannot just assume that everything will be fine. The government has to deliver on its growth agenda,\" he said, referring to the chancellor's plans for a credit-easing scheme for small- and medium-sized companies, as well as support for supply chain firms.</p> <p>The medium term, at least, looks good. Nissan's Sunderland plant will produce the Leaf electric car from 2013, Jaguar Land Rover is creating a further 1,750 jobs in the UK, and Toyota has announced plans for 1,500 new jobs at its plant in Burnaston, Derby. Toyota's deputy head of UK operations, Tony Walker, is a car industry veteran who helped launch the Derby plant 20 years ago. Chastened by his experiences elsewhere, he said there was one overriding goal: \"We were determined not to be like the British car industry.\"</p> <p>Although Nissan led the way in the UK, Toyota is the current pioneer of modern production. Civil servants now come to Burnaston to learn about teamwork and constant improvement, underlining the industry's transformation. \"That old industry of 30 years ago has completely gone,\" Walker said. \"And I don't think the public have grasped that. There are no inefficient factories left.\"</p> <h2>The new Bentley boys</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-384505360\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/1/16/1326737269097/Car-manufacturing-001.jpg\" alt=\"Car manufacturing\" width=\"460\" height=\"399\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Car manufacturing, year-on-year percentage change.

They are popular visitors, often agreeing to sign autographs and chat to workers on the production line.</p> <p>But for the fastest-growing group of Bentley buyers, visits are understandably less frequent. And that is not the only challenge posed by prospective Chinese purchasers, who may overtake Americans as the marque's biggest customer by the end of next year. Chinese Bentley owners prefer to be driven by a chauffeur rather than drive the car themselves. As a consequence, the noise emitted by the exhaust pipe of the Continental Flying Spur model has become an issue.</p> <p>\"A Chinese customer does not want to hear the exhaust tone, and therefore we have had to change the exhaust,\" said Michael Straughan, Bentley's head&#xa0;of manufacturing. \"If a customer wants silence in the back then that is what he will get.\"</p> <p>Bentley offers bespoke vehicles \u2013 an in-car humidor or TV screen is no problem \u2013 and eschews what Straughan calls the \"we know best\" attitude. \"Chinese buyers are sophisticated customers,\" he said. \"They don't want British luxury per se, they want their own car.\" <strong>DM</strong></p>",

While many of the bespoke vehicles rolling off the slow, deliberative production line are destined for status-hungry members of the Chinese middle class, Bentley employees can be heard uttering Japanese phrases that were alien to automotive workers 30 years ago, but are now standard shopfloor lingo. In the woodshop, where door parts carved from walnut blocks are honed to a lacquered finish, an employee describes a kaizen technique, using the Japanese phrase for relentless improvement. A world-class British brand owned by a German manufacturer, benefitting from a production revolution started 6,000 miles away, and thriving on demand from the 21st century's coming economic power. This is a success story that epitomises the importance of exports to Britain's economic wellbeing, while banishing the memory of an industry that was in the doldrums 30 years ago, with a reputation for poor quality and dysfunctional industrial relations. Bentley's cars, which sell for \u00a3124,000 to \u00a3226,000, are produced under the ownership of its German parent, Volkswagen, but the UK industry owes its renaissance to Japan and monozokuri: the art of making things. One employee says Japanese production culture is embedded throughout the industry, adding: \"Why reinvent the wheel?\" In the UK mass production of cars was reinvented three decades ago. Nissan opened Britain's largest car plant in Sunderland in 1986, spearheading a revival that saw the UK industry make around 1.35m cars last year: a rise of about 6% on 2010. This is lower than the industry's peak of 1.9m in 1972, but the key statistic for the economy is where the cars end up: four decades ago a third of UK-made cars were exported. Now it is eight out of 10. The transformation is visible at the end of the production line for the Nissan Qashqai, known in the trade as a compact crossover SUV. At its start, anonymous steel plates are dragged into the maw of a giant pressing machine stamping out 22 car doors a minute. Then, in a process resembling a superorganism, parts travel through an automated chain of spark-firing weld robots and skilled workers fitting a dashboard every three seconds, and a perfectly formed vehicle trundles out every 60 seconds with its destination attached to the windshield. The acronyms that roll past underline the industry's export strength: USR for Russia, the factory's biggest market; UKR for Ukraine; TKY for Turkey and MOR for Morocco. Nissan's senior vice-president for manufacturing in Europe, Trevor Mann, says Britain is an appealing base for foreign manufacturers. The top five UK\u2011based carmakers in 2010 \u2013 all foreign-owned \u2013 were: Nissan, leading the way with 423,000 vehicles; BMW-owned Mini in Cowley; Indian-owned Land Rover in the Midlands; Japan's Honda in Swindon; and the largest Japanese auto company, Toyota, in Derby. As a premium brand, Bentley is a niche player, but it saw sales rise 37% last year as it sold more than 7,000 vehicles. According to Mann, Britain benefits from a strong domestic market, a skilled and flexible workforce, and a happy accident of geography. \"The UK is a competitive manufacturing country at the moment,\" said Mann. \"We are a small island, we are close to the sea \u2013 and the cheapest way to ship things around Europe is by sea. In Sunderland one of the key advantages is we are only three miles from a deep sea port and have good access to Russia, the Middle East and northern Europe.\" Carmakers are leading the economic rebalancing that the UK must undergo because Britons consume too much and manufacture too little. In 2010 the UK imported more goods and services than it exported by a margin of \u00a341bn worth; by making more things that are consumed abroad, rather than by indebted UK households, Britain's current account gains credit. Unwittingly, car manufacturing appears to be leading this transformation after the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) revealed domestic sales fell by 4.4% last year. This week it will reveal that production, on the other hand, surged. \"A lot of the UK's economic problems came from too much spending and borrowing by households and government,\" said Lee Hopley, chief economist at the UK manufacturers' organisation, the EEF. \"We can't rely on either of those for growth in the future. So in terms of where growth will come from, and the parts of the economy that will generate tax revenues and employment, investment in export-driven sectors will be key.\" According to HM Revenue &amp; Customs, in the first 10 months of last year road vehicles were second only to petroleum in the UK export market, generating \u00a322.4bn. It is Britain's largest manufactured export industry. But Bentley's head of manufacturing, Michael Straughan, warns there will not be another production boom like the one set off by Nissan decades ago. \"It is really important that we protect what we have got; that the likes of Honda, Nissan and Toyota stay here, and we encourage Jaguar Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Mini. We are not going to see a 1980s-style transplant of Japanese factories into the UK again.\" The SMMT's chief executive, Paul Everitt, agrees. \"We cannot just assume that everything will be fine. The government has to deliver on its growth agenda,\" he said, referring to the chancellor's plans for a credit-easing scheme for small- and medium-sized companies, as well as support for supply chain firms. The medium term, at least, looks good. Nissan's Sunderland plant will produce the Leaf electric car from 2013, Jaguar Land Rover is creating a further 1,750 jobs in the UK, and Toyota has announced plans for 1,500 new jobs at its plant in Burnaston, Derby. Toyota's deputy head of UK operations, Tony Walker, is a car industry veteran who helped launch the Derby plant 20 years ago. Chastened by his experiences elsewhere, he said there was one overriding goal: \"We were determined not to be like the British car industry.\" Although Nissan led the way in the UK, Toyota is the current pioneer of modern production. Civil servants now come to Burnaston to learn about teamwork and constant improvement, underlining the industry's transformation. \"That old industry of 30 years ago has completely gone,\" Walker said. \"And I don't think the public have grasped that. There are no inefficient factories left.\" The new Bentley boys Premier League footballers are among the prospective Bentley customers who tour the carmaker's Crewe factory before making a purchase. They are popular visitors, often agreeing to sign autographs and chat to workers on the production line. But for the fastest-growing group of Bentley buyers, visits are understandably less frequent. And that is not the only challenge posed by prospective Chinese purchasers, who may overtake Americans as the marque's biggest customer by the end of next year. Chinese Bentley owners prefer to be driven by a chauffeur rather than drive the car themselves. As a consequence, the noise emitted by the exhaust pipe of the Continental Flying Spur model has become an issue. \"A Chinese customer does not want to hear the exhaust tone, and therefore we have had to change the exhaust,\" said Michael Straughan, Bentley's head of manufacturing. \"If a customer wants silence in the back then that is what he will get.\" Bentley offers bespoke vehicles \u2013 an in-car humidor or TV screen is no problem \u2013 and eschews what Straughan calls the \"we know best\" attitude. \"Chinese buyers are sophisticated customers,\" he said. \"They don't want British luxury per se, they want their own car.\" DM",

The move forced European leaders onto the back foot following the mass downgrade of nine eurozone countries by S&amp;P last week.

Germany and Finland, the remaining AAA-rated countries in the single currency, are expected to come under pressure to increase their commitments to bolster the EFSF's funds to prevent a further downgrade and the likelihood that lenders will demand higher interest costs.

Charles Dallara, head of the Institute of International Finance which represents Greece's private creditors, said talks had yet to reach agreement on any aspect of a deal following demands from Greek negotiators for ultra-low interest rates on its outstanding debts. The warning will send a shiver through Europe's capitals, which are pinning their hopes on a private sector deal with Greece to cap the country's ballooning debt bill and prevent contagion to other southern European nations. As George Osborne admitted he could be forced to give billions of pounds in extra funds to the IMF to prevent Europe's debt crisis from spinning out of control, Dallara warned the Greek government that demanding a 4% interest rate meant some banks would be forced to write-off three quarters of their loans. \"That is essentially the area where the differences are substantial,\" Dallara said ahead of a rescheduled meeting on Wednesday. \"They are looking at the private sector to accept interest rates that they would not accept [themselves], which is completely unreasonable.\" Greece has accused hedge funds and banks of undermining a deal following a collapse in talks last Friday. Sources close to Athens said creditors were using brinkmanship to extract a high interest rate on outstanding debts to offset losses from a cut in the value of loans. Banks have proved adept in the last couple of years in appearing to offer debt forgiveness while imposing a higher interest rate that allows them to recoup much of their losses. However, bankers have insisted they need to drive a hard bargain following pressure to build up their reserves amid concerns of a recession this year and the potential for a repeat of 2008's credit crunch. Eurozone banks must find an extra \u00a3120bn to bolster their capital under rules imposed by Brussels. Some analysts expect banks to need in excess of \u20ac120bn (\u00a3100bn) to satisfy international investors that they could remain solvent in a difficult economic period. Danny Gabay, a former Bank of England economist, said that the bill for recapitalising European banks was far in excess of Brussels' estimate and nearer \u20ac1.8 trillion. Gabay, who runs Fathom Consulting, said: \"There is a way out if policymakers across Europe, and most notably those in Frankfurt, come to their senses and do what needs doing. Both they and we have long known that a wholesale recapitalisation of the European banking system is the necessary first step in resolving this crisis.\" Gabay said the European Central Bank would also need to follow the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve by pumping cheap money into the financial system using quantitative easing (QE). The ECB has proved reluctant to begin QE without firmer agreement among eurozone nations over which countries will pay the costs of bailing out indebted member states. It is also concerned to see closer fiscal co-operation to prevent cheap money being used to avoid implementing tough austerity measures. Speaking to a German newspaper, ECB executive board member J\u00f6rg Asmussen warned that a new fiscal pact under discussion was being softened. Eurozone nations agreed before Christmas to fashion a closer union that would involve increased oversight of national budgets. But Asmussen, who formerly worked for Germany's finance minister, said a draft agreement that allowed countries to loosen the spending rules in extraordinary circumstances amounted to a \"substantial watering down\". Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and Ireland have become dependent on the ECB to lend funds as private investors shun European debt markets. Spain will test market appetite for its short-term debt on Tuesday for the first time since a downgrade by ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's last week. Analysts said it faces a far bigger hurdle on Thursday at an auction of bonds with maturities of up to 10 years. Despite the two-notch cut by S&amp;P, Spain is tipped to draw solid demand at both auctions, benefiting from support from banks flush with ECB cash and market perceptions the new government is serious about addressing the country's economic woes.",

We need more individuals to have a real stake in their firms,\" said Nick Clegg on Monday. The deputy prime minister called his vision \"more of a John Lewis economy, if you like\". Fair enough: the cause of diversity in the corporate jungle would be enhanced greatly if there were more democratically run, 100% employee-owned businesses like John Lewis. So, yes, it's reasonable to try to find ways to encourage the creation of more. Unfortunately, Clegg didn't stop at that one good thought. Other parts of his speech \u2013 notably when he argued for a \"decade of employee share ownership\" \u2013 raised more questions than answers. Take the idea of giving employees a \"new, universal 'right to request' shares\". As Clegg put it: \"Imagine: an automatic opportunity for every employee to seek to enter into a share scheme, enjoying the tax benefits that come with it, taking what for many people might seem out of their reach, and turning it into a routine decision.\" But how would this automatic right work? Would the owner of a private business \u2013 say, an entrepreneur with 20 staff \u2013 be obliged to allow his employees to buy a few shares from him or her every year? If so, what would be the pricing mechanism in such a sale? When there's no public market in the shares, would an external auditor be brought in to offer an opinion? What if the entrepreneur doesn't want to dilute his holding? Would he or she be obliged to sell? If so, what percentage would have to be released? Entrepreneurs, one suspects, would smell a disincentive to start a business in the first place. It might be argued that it would be easier to impose a right-to-buy on quoted companies, where there is at least a transparent pricing mechanism called the stock market. That's true, and established schemes such as Save As You Earn, giving an option to buy shares, provide a model. But let's not get carried away and think, as Clegg seemed to, that greater share ownership by employees would act as a brake on \"crony capitalism\" and egregious boardroom pay. It would be a tall order, even with lavish tax breaks, for staff to save enough to assemble a collective 5% stake in most multibillion FTSE 100 companies. Boardroom directors will not quake at that prospect. If you really wanted to shake things up, stick an employee on the pay committee. Then there's also the question of how much it is healthy for staff to invest in their employers. Stories of shop-floor workers getting rich as their companies succeed are uplifting. But ask the many thousands of staff at, say, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland how they feel about the savings they invested in those supposedly solid banks: there are many, many stories of substantial savings pots evaporating with the share prices. Clegg ended his passage about the \"right to request\" shares by saying \"clearly the details of that kind of policy need to be properly thought through\". You bet: as it stands, it's a half-baked idea.",

      "bodyText": "Unilever workers are going on strike over their pensions. They're crazy when the Pot Noodle to Dove soap firm is only downshifting their retirement incomes from final salary to career average. This is not an offer that deserves to spark a strike, no matter how badly the management have behaved (and according to the unions they have behaved very badly). Their pensions will still rank among the most generous in the country. Firstly, workers get to keep all their past entitlements. For older workers that means all their final salary benefits until now are kept intact. Second, it's true they get a slightly cheaper scheme in the future, but for most factory workers, who will retire on an income not dissimilar to the one they started on (plus inflation), it makes virtually no difference. Obviously workers are angry at the screamingly high pay of the chief executive and he did his best to inflame the situation last year with a 50% pay rise. It is also the case that Unilever is a profitable company and can afford to bung a bit more in the pension scheme. Except a final salary pension scheme has become a blank cheque for older workers who expect a caste iron guarantee no matter how long they live and no matter what happens to pension investments. Employers must add in the region of 40% to 50% to the salary of a worker over the age of 50 who enjoys final salary benefits. In most companies a new employee must join an even cheaper stock market invested scheme dependent on rising share prices. They will be lucky to muster a 10% contribution from their employer. According to research from Pension Corporation, the additional cost to employers of providing a defined benefit pension has increased by 44% in the last 20 years as a result of government legislation \u2013 including the requirement to update pensions in line with inflation. Pensions minister Steve Webb is considering abolishing the need to up-rate final salary pensions in line with inflation. That's because employers tell him they will close without this kind of help. So what are unions doing fighting for final salary schemes when a disproportionate amount of pension scheme cash goes to the better off? Senior staff on big salaries get a bigger retirement pay day under rules that give them two thirds of their last pay cheque. Ask who is driving the 4x4 down your street? Most likely they are a retired Unilever manager, an ex-BT engineer or a former headteacher.

      "body": "<p>Unilever workers are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jan/07/unilever-strikes-pension-closure\" title=\"\">going on strike over their pensions</a>. They're crazy when the Pot Noodle to Dove soap firm is only downshifting their retirement incomes from final salary to career average.</p> <p>This is not an offer that deserves to spark a strike, no matter how badly the management have behaved (and according to the unions they have behaved very badly). Their pensions will still rank among the most generous in the country.</p> <p>Firstly, workers get to keep all their past entitlements. For older workers that means all their final salary benefits until now are kept intact. </p> <p>Second, it's true they get a slightly cheaper scheme in the future, but for most factory workers, who will retire on an income not dissimilar to the one they started on (plus inflation), it makes virtually no difference.</p> <p>Obviously workers are angry at the screamingly high pay of the chief executive and he did his best to inflame the situation last year with a 50% pay rise. It is also the case that Unilever is a profitable company and can afford to bung a bit more in the pension scheme.</p> <p>Except a final salary pension scheme has become a blank cheque for older workers who expect a caste iron guarantee no matter how long they live and no matter what happens to pension investments.</p> <p>Employers must add in the region of 40% to 50% to the salary of a worker over the age of 50 who enjoys final salary benefits. In most companies a new employee must join an even cheaper stock market invested scheme dependent on rising share prices. They will be lucky to muster a 10% contribution from their employer.</p> <p>According to research from Pension Corporation, the additional cost to employers of providing a defined benefit pension has increased by 44% in the last 20 years as a result of government legislation \u2013 including the requirement to update pensions in line with inflation.</p> <p>Pensions minister Steve Webb is considering abolishing the need to up-rate final salary pensions in line with inflation. That's because employers tell him they will close without this kind of help.</p> <p>So what are unions doing fighting for final salary schemes when a disproportionate amount of pension scheme cash goes to the better off? Senior staff on big salaries get a bigger retirement pay day under rules that give them two thirds of their last pay cheque. Ask who is driving the 4x4 down your street? Most likely they are a retired Unilever manager, an ex-BT engineer or a former headteacher.</p> <p>To eradicate the whole problem of underfunding, across all sectors, unions should have approached the pension issue on behalf of future members as well as existing workers. Only one has taken this stance to my knowledge, and that was shop workers' union Usdaw in 2003 when it persuaded members at Tesco and Sainsbury to relinquish all past entitlements in favour of a career average scheme.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Carnival, the company that owns the cruise ship that capsized off the coast of Italy over the weekend, lost almost a fifth of their value on Monday. The FTSE 100 company, which owns the Costa Concordia via an Italian subsidiary, saw its shares collapse by as much as 30% when the stock market opened before later recovering to \u00a318.62, a fall of 17%. The share price collapse, which wiped more than \u00a31bn off Carnival's stock market value, came after the company warned that it was \"not possible to determine\" the full cost of the disaster. Carnival said the Costa Concordia would be out of action until at least November and put initial estimates of the cost at $95m (\u00a362m). However, analysts said the costs are likely to be far greater. \"This tragedy will be a black mark on the cruise industry and a negative headline for Carnival.
