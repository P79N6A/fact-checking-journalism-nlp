      "bodyText": "It is always exciting to overhear the conversations of people planning to do something bad, and there is something disturbingly compelling about reading the emails and instant messages exchanged by Barclays bankers in the process of rigging interest rates for their own gain. Technicalities aside, they are in a familiar register. It's not the cool calculation of spies plotting an intelligence operation, nor the furtive euphemisms of criminals planning a bank heist, but something more ordinary and more intense: lovers in the throes of an illicit affair. Favours are begged and joyfully rewarded, terms of endearment lovingly dropped, affections ecstatically expressed. The parties appear to take a certain pleasure in playing their allotted roles: seducer and faux-reluctant seducee. Some background: the scandal involves two species of banker: \"traders\" and \"submitters\". It's the job of submitters to send accurate information about the day's trading to the banking authorities, so that they can set benchmark interest rates, based on submissions from all the big banks. It is the job of traders to make bets on the level of interest rates \u2013 on Libor and Euribor numbers. If traders can influence the calculation of these numbers by the breadth of a gelled hair then they stand to make a lot of money for their employer, and for themselves in the form of bonuses. In this game, then, traders seduce, and the resonantly named submitters are seduced. Like any dutiful philanderer, the Barclays trader knows it's important to show some respect to the object of his ministrations. \"Please feel free to say 'no'\", says one to a submitter, after requesting a quick fiddle of the Libors \u2013 and that they must also be showered with gifts: \"Coffees will be coming your way either way.\" The same trader explains modestly that the cappuccinos are \"just to say thank you for your help in the past few weeks\". The corresponding submitter, having submitted, replies: \"Done, for you big boy.\" It brings a tear to the eye. Like lovers who embark on an affair because of, as well as despite, its wrongness, the erring bankers clearly took a special pleasure in crossing boundaries. Here is a Barclays trader explaining the rules of the game to a nervous novice: \"This is the way you pull off deals like this Chicken, don't talk about it too much \u2026 this is between you and me, but really don't tell ANYBODY.\" In those capital letters alone you can the smell the fevered pleasure of taking part in a conspiracy, knowing that they might get caught out. But then, as with any affair, there is always the prospect of time together alone, of stolen moments free from the possibility of prying eyes: \"Dude. I owe you big time! Come over one day after work and I'm opening a bottle of Bollinger.\" This, then, is what brings down banks and distorts economies: sexting with pound signs, followed, at the end of the day, by a Bollinger ejaculation. It need hardly be said that bankers, particularly on trading floors, are overwhelmingly male. This matters. There is much that is comic about the sexualised nature of this male-on-male banter, but it points to a deeper truth about the psychology of organisations. Put a bunch of confident, aggressive men in the same room and reward them for taking risks, and you create a pressure cooker, from which probity and prudence evaporate like steam. In 2008 John Coates and Joe Herbert from Cambridge University shadowed 17 male traders over the course of eight days. The traders worked on a typical City of London trading floor, where their decisions affected the outcomes of trades worth millions of pounds. The traders earned good salaries and were able to make bonuses of up to \u00a35m. At the beginning and end of each working day, Coates and Herbert measured the testosterone levels of each trader (before you ask, they did so by taking saliva samples). They also recorded how much profit and loss each trader made that day. The researchers found that on days when the traders beat their previous monthly average, their testosterone levels would go through the roof. One trader, for example, enjoyed a winning streak that saw his profits reach twice his historic average \u2013 and his testosterone increase by 76%. Even more significantly, Coates and Herbert found that when traders' morning levels of testosterone were higher than normal, they made higher profits than days when they started off with low levels. In other words, better trades produced more testosterone, and testosterone made them better traders. What makes you a better trader for a day or a week, however, can in the long term lead you to take disastrous mistakes. Testosterone, of course, is linked to sexual excitement, which would explain the overheated tone of those Barclays emails. It is also linked to risk-taking. When researchers at Harvard asked students to play an investment game, in which every participant was given a sum of money and asked to invest as much or as little of it as they wished, the men with above-average levels of the hormone were much more likely to make risky investments. It doesn't take a great leap to see that Barclays traders were getting high on more than one type of risk. But sex and risk aren't the only elements in this unstable compound: there is also power. Although the traders must cajole the submitters into doing what they want them to do, it is clear who the real boss is in the trader-submitter relationship. The traders are the prime movers; the submitters can only refuse. Their relative positions can be explained by where they sit within the bank. The traders sit in the front office of a trading floor, amusingly nicknamed \"the dark side\" by its inhabitants. This where the BSD, or big swinging dicks, hang out, eyes fixed to their screens, as they make trades, throw back coffees, and all the while make minute assessments of their own place in a hierarchy in which the biggest earners \u2013 the \"rainmakers\" \u2013 sit at the top. The back- and middle-office is populated by those who, like the submitters, do the trader's paperwork. The bank's \"risk and compliance officers\" have the unglamorous and low-status job of ensuring traders comply with the bank's internal rules. It's not cool to be in compliance: they are known as \"business blockers\", profit-suckers who contribute only cost to the company's bottom line. Being a trader is really the only job to have. It is hardly surprising that submitters should want to please the boys in the front office; power is famously seductive. Psychologists have found that testosterone levels go up and down with status and power \u2013 something that is true of women as well as men \u2013 and so do ethical standards. Joris Lammers, a psychologist from Tilburg University in the Netherlands, asked 61 people to write about a time when they felt either powerful or powerless: a standard way of \"priming\" people to feel something. He then gave his subjects the chance to decide how many lottery tickets they should receive, by rolling two dice without anyone else \u2013 as far as they knew \u2013 looking on. Those primed to feel powerful were more likely to lie about their scores in order to wangle extra tickets. Oddly, when the same people were asked if it was ever OK to cheat on expenses, they were more likely to express strong disapproval of cheating. In a series of similar experiments, Lammers found the same thing over and over: people who felt more powerful were more likely to be hypocritical. You may have wondered why bankers \u2013 and not just traders, but executives like Bob Diamond \u2013 seem to find it hard to understand why so many people are so angry with them. Another recent study suggests an explanation: they have had several points chopped off their emotional IQ by the experience of power. Deborah Gruenfeld, a professor of management at Stanford University, designed an experiment that was inspired by her experience of sitting next to a high-powered businessman on a plane. Instead of turning off his overhead fan, he wordlessly directed it away from his face and into hers. Gruenfeld sat there for a minute before realising she could turn the fan off herself. As she reached up do so, she began to wonder if power makes people more assertive and, at the same time, corrodes their ability to see something from someone else's point of view. In Gruenfeld's experiment, the subjects were primed to feel either powerful or powerless, before being ushered into a separate room, where they were covertly filmed. They were told to sit down at a desk, on which there was a packet of papers for them to look at. In front of their seat there were table fans at full blast, positioned by the experimenters to blow on the participants in an annoying way. The \"high-power\" subjects were far more likely to move the fan off the desk, while the subjects primed to feel powerless meekly put up with being gusted on. In a follow-up experiment, people primed in the same way were provided with a marker and asked to draw a capital E on their forehead (they were reassured that it would be removed before they left). There are two ways to do this: you can draw the E as if you are reading it yourself, which makes it illegible to anyone else. Or you can draw it \"backwards\", so that another person can easily read it. The high-powered people were three times more likely to adopt the former strategy. It didn't occur to them think about someone else's perspective. It may seem hard to believe in the ease with which people can be made to think and behave differently by the simple act of priming them to do so. But one of the recurring themes of decades of similar experiments is that although we all like to think of ourselves as good people, our ethical choices depend to a surprising extent on the choices we're presented with at any given moment, as well as the people we're surrounded by. The banking problem is multifaceted: it's an ethical problem, an incentive problem and a regulation problem. But above all, it's a problem of having too many over-confident people in the same room. A group of people high on the same combination of sex, power and risk is bound to make the already very confident feel dangerously invincible, and untethered from any legal or ethical obligation. There was too much confidence on the Barclays trading floor, just as there has been \u2013 and somehow continues to be \u2013 in the boardroom. The traders thought they could get away with cheating, while the board seem unable to see what the fuss is about. Barclays is full of men with backwards Es on their faces, all telling each other they can read it just fine. People talk about the \"confidence crisis\" in banking as if the problem is there's too little of it. The real problem is the opposite.

More than \u00a34bn has been wiped off the value of the bank since the rate-fixing scandal emerged.</p> <p>\"It is time to do something about the banking system,\" King said. As he warned that the outlook for financial stability had deteriorated as a result of the eurozone crisis, he dismissed mounting calls for a Leveson-style investigation into banks, saying that enough was already known to implement root and branch reform of the City.</p> <p>But Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said an inquiry was needed. He said: \"The governor is right to say that there is a real cultural problem in our banks which these latest scandals expose, and I don't think it is right for government ministers \u2013 or for the governor, actually \u2013 to say we have had enough inquiries.\"</p> <p>King said: \"Many people in the banking industry are hardworking and feel badly let down by some of their colleagues and leaders. It goes to the culture and the structure of banks: the excessive compensation, the shoddy treatment of customers, the deceitful manipulation of a key interest rate, and today, news of yet another mis-selling scandal.\"</p> <p>Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were ordered by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to pay redress to small business customers after it found \"serious failings\" in the way they were sold complex financial products intended to protect them from interest rate rises. The revelations caused outrage among business groups, with the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI all condemning the fleecing of their business members. John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said the latest scandal would \"damage business's perception of banks further\".</p> <p>Yesterday, the RBS chief executive Stephen Hester bowed to pressure caused by the continuing row about the computer meltdown that left some customers unable to access their accounts by forgoing a bonus of up to \u00a32.4m for 2012.</p> <p>However, the pressure on Diamond is even greater, but the Barclays boss has made it clear he will not voluntarily step down. The bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, is also in the line of fire and may be forced out in an attempt to show that a boardroom executive is paying the price for the record-breaking \u00a3290m fine and damage to the bank's reputation. Barclays shareholders are thought to be considering appointing a figurehead to conduct a review of the culture inside the bank.</p> <p>The political pressure continued to mount on Diamond. Asked whether he was the right man to lead Barclays, David Cameron said: \"I can't say that. He has questions to answer.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's remarks mirrored those of King and Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, who both twice declined the opportunity to say that Diamond was \"fit and proper\" to run Barclays.</p> <p>Barclays was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\" title=\"\">fined a record \u00a3290m on Wednesday for attempting to manipulate crucial interest rates known</a> as the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor), both of which are crucial in setting the price at which customers borrow for mortgages, between 2005 and 2009.</p> <p>The fine was published alongside a series of emails showing how traders helped each other to try to manipulate interest rates with promises of champagne and quips like \"this is for you, big boy\".</p> <p>Sir Roger Carr, president of employers' body the CBI, said: \"The manipulation of the Libor arrangements is deplorable and undermines international trust in the integrity of the City. The weakness must be addressed and the culprits punished.\"</p> <p>King said the question of who ran the UK's banks was a question for another day, insisting that the immediate priority was for the government to implement in full the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking, headed by Sir John Vickers, which called for firewalls to be set up between the investment and retail arms of banks. He said the cultures of investment and retail banking were different and needed to be separated.</p> <p>Turner said that there was a \"culture of cynicism and greed that is quite shocking\". Andrew Bailey, the top banking regulator at the FSA, said the onus was on bank boards to take action. \"If, as we now see, there is a fundamental breakdown in trust, the bank boards have to recognise that trust has to be got back and they have to think very hard about how they do that,\" he said.</p> <p>The prime minister agreed with King's calls for a cultural change in banking. \"We know what's gone wrong and largely we know what needs to be done to put it right.

      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, piled the pressure on the City on Friday when he said something had gone \"very wrong\" with Britain's banks that needed to be put right. As Barclays and other high street banks became embroiled in a new mis-selling scandal, King launched his most scathing attack yet on the culture of banking in the five-year-long financial crisis. King refused to say Bob Diamond was a \"fit and proper\" person to run Barclays as the reputational damage from an interest rate-fixing fine led to another fall in the bank's shares. More than \u00a34bn has been wiped off the value of the bank since the rate-fixing scandal emerged. \"It is time to do something about the banking system,\" King said. As he warned that the outlook for financial stability had deteriorated as a result of the eurozone crisis, he dismissed mounting calls for a Leveson-style investigation into banks, saying that enough was already known to implement root and branch reform of the City. But Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said an inquiry was needed. He said: \"The governor is right to say that there is a real cultural problem in our banks which these latest scandals expose, and I don't think it is right for government ministers \u2013 or for the governor, actually \u2013 to say we have had enough inquiries.\" King said: \"Many people in the banking industry are hardworking and feel badly let down by some of their colleagues and leaders. It goes to the culture and the structure of banks: the excessive compensation, the shoddy treatment of customers, the deceitful manipulation of a key interest rate, and today, news of yet another mis-selling scandal.\" Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were ordered by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to pay redress to small business customers after it found \"serious failings\" in the way they were sold complex financial products intended to protect them from interest rate rises. The revelations caused outrage among business groups, with the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI all condemning the fleecing of their business members. John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said the latest scandal would \"damage business's perception of banks further\". Yesterday, the RBS chief executive Stephen Hester bowed to pressure caused by the continuing row about the computer meltdown that left some customers unable to access their accounts by forgoing a bonus of up to \u00a32.4m for 2012. However, the pressure on Diamond is even greater, but the Barclays boss has made it clear he will not voluntarily step down. The bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, is also in the line of fire and may be forced out in an attempt to show that a boardroom executive is paying the price for the record-breaking \u00a3290m fine and damage to the bank's reputation. Barclays shareholders are thought to be considering appointing a figurehead to conduct a review of the culture inside the bank. The political pressure continued to mount on Diamond. Asked whether he was the right man to lead Barclays, David Cameron said: \"I can't say that. He has questions to answer.\" The prime minister's remarks mirrored those of King and Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, who both twice declined the opportunity to say that Diamond was \"fit and proper\" to run Barclays. Barclays was fined a record \u00a3290m on Wednesday for attempting to manipulate crucial interest rates known as the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor), both of which are crucial in setting the price at which customers borrow for mortgages, between 2005 and 2009. The fine was published alongside a series of emails showing how traders helped each other to try to manipulate interest rates with promises of champagne and quips like \"this is for you, big boy\". Sir Roger Carr, president of employers' body the CBI, said: \"The manipulation of the Libor arrangements is deplorable and undermines international trust in the integrity of the City. The weakness must be addressed and the culprits punished.\" King said the question of who ran the UK's banks was a question for another day, insisting that the immediate priority was for the government to implement in full the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking, headed by Sir John Vickers, which called for firewalls to be set up between the investment and retail arms of banks. He said the cultures of investment and retail banking were different and needed to be separated. Turner said that there was a \"culture of cynicism and greed that is quite shocking\". Andrew Bailey, the top banking regulator at the FSA, said the onus was on bank boards to take action. \"If, as we now see, there is a fundamental breakdown in trust, the bank boards have to recognise that trust has to be got back and they have to think very hard about how they do that,\" he said. The prime minister agreed with King's calls for a cultural change in banking. \"We know what's gone wrong and largely we know what needs to be done to put it right. What you are going to see from the government is an incredibly methodical series of actions to deal with all of these problems,\" he said as he rejected the call by Balls for a Leveson-style inquiry. \"People are shocked by the swaggering arrogance of what we have discovered in the last 24 hours. We really need to open this wide open,\" said Balls. Knowing he was opening himself up to a political backlash as he was City minister for part of the Labour government's time in office, Balls admitted mistakes had been made. Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat peer, said Balls and the former prime minister Gordon Brown would need to be the first two witnesses called to give evidence.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the Institute of Directors (IoD) led the mounting clamour on Friday from the City, business leaders and politicians for a cull at the top of Britain's banks. In an unusually strong condemnation of the culture of banking, Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, said it was \"high time\" for a clearout of top bankers after a wave of mis-selling scandals and market manipulation. His remarks came on a day when pressure was mounting on Bob Diamond to step down as chief executive of Barclays in the wake of the record-breaking \u00a3290m fine for the bank's attempt to fix a crucial interest rate and as the Financial Services Authority ordered Barclays and three other high street banks to compensate up to 28,000 small businesses that were mis-sold products designed to minimise their risk against interest rates going up. A 10-day computer meltdown at Royal Bank of Scotland, which left up to 13 million customers unable to get their current account balances, hardened attitudes among the public and politicians that the clean-up exercise from the 2008 banking crisis still had a long way to go. David Cameron, Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, business secretary Vince Cable and Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, all queued up to condemn the culture in the City. Despite the 2008 bailout of the banks, the City has fended off the root and branch reform favoured by King because of a powerful lobbying campaign that emphasised its pivotal role in the UK economy. But that argument has been turned on its head in the past 72 hours by the extraordinary revelations about systemic bad practice among traders in setting interest rates known as the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Now the argument is that Britain's vital interests in financial services can only be protected by a restoration of trust that demands a shakeout of the management of the banks. The strongest condemnation came from Walker, who was infuriated by the abusive treatment of small firms with the mis-selling of interest rate swaps. \"This mis-selling is an outrageous scandal, which has cost many people their livelihoods and caused huge distress for many more. The regulator must ensure there are severe consequences for those responsible. As well as ripping off their customers, they have also harmed the reputation of business as a whole \u2013 they should feel deep shame for the damage they have done. \"This news, combined with the exposure of abusive Libor rate manipulation, demonstrates that there is a serious failure of leadership in many of the banks. It is high time for a clearout of the leaders who created this mess, and they should be replaced with new blood,\" he said. The call for change is not the first since the financial meltdown began almost five years ago with the credit crunch and the run on Northern Rock. In the autumn of 2008, there were calls for change at the top after the government bailed out RBS, Lloyds and HBOS to prevent them from collapsing. The culture of big pay deals never changed and has been a nagging sore for voters as a tentative recovery in the economy has been aborted and Britain has slipped into a double-dip recession. Many of the leaders of that era have gone, and the interest rate manipulation took place under a previous regime. Nevertheless, for those calling for Diamond's scalp, the key point is that he was running the division of Barclays that was caught up in the scandal. More broadly, the revelations this week have scuppered any efforts by the banks to water down the forthcoming legislation to ringfence retail banks from the \"casino\" investment banks, as recommended by Sir John Vickers. Vince Cable, the business secretary, said: \"This mis-selling scandal is an urgent and immediate problem the government has got to tackle. We are trying to clear up a massive cesspit and we have got to deal with it through tough regulation, through taxation and through this crucially important bit of legislation separating out the casinos, the investment banks, from the ordinary retail banks.\" Cable said the mis-selling of interest rate-hedging products to businesses such as fish and chip shops and butchers was \"very, very cynical\". \"Businesses were being told they could only have a bank loan if they bought one of these products and a lot of these companies are now being ruined on the back of this,\" he said. Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat peer and campaigner for bank reform, said: \"No one knows better than the governor [of the Bank of England] the risk we run every day that passes until we break up the banks. Passing Vickers into law is a top priority for parliament to make banks safe and take taxpayers' guarantees away from greedy gamblers like Bob Diamond.\" The complete separation of high street banks from investment banks has so far been avoided. The ringfencing move was a less bad option for the banks, which argue they can operate more efficiently by uniting all their businesses under one roof. Banks may now feel that the current Vickers proposals are the best they can hope for now the views expressed by Walker are being echoed by investors in the City as well as their traditional critics. \"Bankers need to be very clear that the old culture of sharp practice and playing fast and loose with the rules is not acceptable. The challenges facing the banks remain considerable and now is the time for responsible leadership. We need to rebuild a banking system that is robust, credible and trusted,\" said Iain Richards, head of governance and responsible investment at Threadneedle. Tony Greenham, the head of finance at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: \"Trust is at the very core of banking. This is a perfect manifestation of what has been taking place over the past 10 or 20 years: a progressive erosion of the values of the City. Banking only works if you put the customer first. Honesty and integrity have to guide everything you do, and that may not be the way to maximise your bonus, or your short-term profits.\"",

      "bodyText": "The tourists ambling down Ledra Street in the hot midday sun are a welcome sight \u2013 and not just for crisis-hit Cyprus's shopkeepers. Four days after Nicosia sought financial help from the EU \u2013 the latest casualty of an escalating drama that has now reached the bloc's most easterly shores \u2013 care-free holidaymakers have become a reassuring presence for locals, too. \"If it wasn't for them there'd be a feeling of complete darkness,\" said Stavroula Stamatiou, sipping an iced lemon at a bar on the busy boulevard. \"They're uplifting in a way that until now I'd never have thought would be the case.\" The country that assumes the presidency of the EU on Sunday is to be bailed out to the tune of an estimated \u20ac10bn (\u00a38bn) \u2013 more than half the island's GDP. At all hours of the night and day, labourers are hard at work embellishing the Cypriot capital ready for its presidency \u2013 roads have been freshly surfaced, flower beds installed, pavements broadened. But for visitors the signs of distress are hard to miss. No amount of cosmetic makeup can hide the glaring fact that the island's once robust economy has well and truly hit the rocks. Beyond the bustling tourist hive around the city's Venetian walled old town, the telltale signs of recession are everywhere \u2013 in the boarded up shops, the \"for rent\" signs draped from the verandas of private homes, the empty showrooms and empty stores. \"Every day there is someone who comes into this shop to sell jewellery or gold sovereigns their families may have kept, anything to make a bit of cash,\" said Costas Mavrikios, a longtime goldsmith on Ledra Street. \"The crisis is everywhere.\" Cypriots are phlegmatic in a way their more hot-blooded Greek neighbours are not. Aided by a public administration established when Cyprus was a crown colony, business-savvy islanders are acutely aware of their economy's radical transformation from the ruins of 1974 \u2013 when Turkey invaded following attempts to unify the island with Greece \u2013 to economic role model as a global offshore banking and shipping centre. With recovery had come an overriding sense of immunity. Since the eruption of Europe's great financial crisis in Athens in late 2009, Cypriots had watched events unfold with wide-eyed surprise at the scale of Greece's economic mess and relief that at least it was not affecting them. Now that its toxic effects have rippled across the sea \u2013 engulfing the island nation through the exposure of its banks to debt-stricken Greece \u2013 shock has been replaced by anger at the way the crisis has been handled, not least by Demetris Christofias, the country's veteran communist president. \"Nobody saw this coming and nobody thought the IMF would be part of the rescue as well,\" said Hubert Faustmann, a prominent political analyst. \"The public is not prepared for a fully-fledged fiscal consolidation programme along the lines that the troika has imposed on Greece. No one anticipated the economy to be in such a bad state.\" For many the rude awakening has been exacerbated only by embarrassment that Cyprus should be reduced to joining the bailed-out club of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece just when it is about to take over the EU presidency. No one denies that it hurt when Kurt Lauk, the president of the economic council of Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, pronounced this week that putting Cyprus at the helm of the EU was tantamount to allowing \"the dog \u2026 to be put in charge of the supply of sausages\". With the island shut out of international markets for the past year, finance ministry officials insist that the decision to resort to the EU rescue fund will give it the breathing space to ring-fence banks operating in Greece. Anger at Athens is almost palpable. At \u20ac18bn, the Cypriot economy may be worth only a fraction even of tiny Greece's, but with officials calculating the bailout at around \u20ac10bn, Nicosia is mortgaging its future for decades. \"For the last two months we've had no government to talk to because of their idiotic decision to hold elections,\" said one official who requested anonymity. \"Had we been able to prepare beforehand, we may well have been able to ease the conditions in return for assistance. Instead, we've had to deal with their stupidities.\" Cypriot-owned banks account for more than 10% of Greece's entire banking system, with local lenders suffering an estimated \u20ac6bn losses following the massive restructuring of Greek debt. Buoyed by their success, banks overzealously invested in Greek government bonds. \"Our crisis is the result purely of over-exposure to Greek banks,\" said George Sklavos, a senior economist at the finance ministry. \"At 72% our debt to GDP ratio is among the lowest in the EU \u2026 yes, we could have taken measures earlier but they wouldn't have solved the problem because our problem is linked to the banking system in Greece.\" But the magnitude of the support now needed has sparked widespread criticism that the government has exploited the banking crisis. Faced with a presidential election next February, Christofias has been increasingly accused of hoodwinking the public into believing that state finances were better than they were declared to be. Public debt has doubled in the time the 65-year-old leader has been in office, with Cyprus's budget deficit last year hitting 6.3% of GDP compared with a budget surplus of 3.5% when it joined the euro in 2008. A profligate public sector, with golden handshakes and mammoth benefits handed out indiscriminately to the rich and poor, also grew as the ruling communists handed out favours. On the eve of Nicosia formally making its funding request, the communist leader announced that the economy had \"healthy foundations\" despite unemployment reaching a record 10%. In his 11th-floor office, Cyprus's former president George Vasilliou shakes his head more in sorrow than anger at his island's plight. The crisis is by far the worse since 1974 and, he says, it could have been avoided. \"Everyone constantly said there was no serious problem with public finances but it was obvious there was,\" he lamented. \"We needed to address it long ago \u2026 instead every effort was made to avoid facing reality.\" A president out of his depth Demetris Christofias is the only communist leader of a European state. The Russian-educated 65-year-old remains a diehard believer in the tenets of marxist-leninism. On the eve of requesting financial help, he lashed out at the European Union and International Monetary Fund for their \"colonial occupation\" of countries they had sought to rescue. The son of a builder, he retains good relations with Moscow and Beijing. Christofias further unnerved Brussels by insisting that he may supplement whatever financial aid Nicosia receives with a loan from Russia or China. \"He is completely out of his depth and, as the end of his term in office approaches, there is an overriding sense of failure \u2013 that he has failed the nation and himself,\" said an insider. \"The tragedy is, he isn't a bad man. He isn't corrupt. He is just corrupt ideologically and that got in the way of making essential changes to the economy.\" Christofias won office after pledging to reunify Cyprus's divided Greek and Turkish communities. Little progress was made in talks brokered by the UN. With the Cypriot economy now in freefall \u2013 and likely to be administered a hard-hitting austerity programme when EU and IMF officials begin assessing its true state on Monday \u2013 many believe that the veteran leftist will go down in history as perhaps the worst president since the island won independence from the British in 1960.",

Four days after Nicosia sought financial help from the EU \u2013 the latest casualty of an escalating drama that has now reached the bloc's most easterly shores \u2013 care-free holidaymakers have become a reassuring presence for locals, too.</p> <p>\"If it wasn't for them there'd be a feeling of complete darkness,\" said Stavroula Stamatiou, sipping an iced lemon at a bar on the busy boulevard. \"They're uplifting in a way that until now I'd never have thought would be the case.\"</p> <p>The country that assumes the presidency of the EU on Sunday is to be bailed out to the tune of an estimated \u20ac10bn (\u00a38bn) \u2013 more than half the island's GDP.</p> <p>At all hours of the night and day, labourers are hard at work embellishing the Cypriot capital ready for its presidency \u2013 roads have been freshly surfaced, flower beds installed, pavements broadened. But for visitors the signs of distress are hard to miss. No amount of cosmetic makeup can hide the glaring fact that the island's once robust economy has well and truly hit the rocks. Beyond the bustling tourist hive around the city's Venetian walled old town, the telltale signs of recession are everywhere \u2013 in the boarded up shops, the \"for rent\" signs draped from the verandas of private homes, the empty showrooms and empty stores.</p> <p>\"Every day there is someone who comes into this shop to sell jewellery or gold sovereigns their families may have kept, anything to make a bit of cash,\" said Costas Mavrikios, a longtime goldsmith on Ledra Street. \"The crisis is everywhere.\"</p> <p>Cypriots are phlegmatic in a way their more hot-blooded Greek neighbours are not. Aided by a public administration established when Cyprus was a crown colony, business-savvy islanders are acutely aware of their economy's radical transformation from the ruins of 1974 \u2013 when Turkey invaded following attempts to unify the island with Greece \u2013 to economic role model as a global offshore banking and shipping centre.</p> <p>With recovery had come an overriding sense of immunity. Since the eruption of Europe's great financial crisis in Athens in late 2009, Cypriots had watched events unfold with wide-eyed surprise at the scale of Greece's economic mess and relief that at least it was not affecting them.</p> <p>Now that its toxic effects have rippled across the sea \u2013 engulfing the island nation through the exposure of its banks to debt-stricken Greece \u2013 shock has been replaced by anger at the way the crisis has been handled, not least by Demetris Christofias, the country's veteran communist president.</p> <p>\"Nobody saw this coming and nobody thought the IMF would be part of the rescue as well,\" said Hubert Faustmann, a prominent political analyst. \"The public is not prepared for a fully-fledged fiscal consolidation programme along the lines that the troika has imposed on Greece. No one anticipated the economy to be in such a bad state.\"</p> <p>For many the rude awakening has been exacerbated only by embarrassment that Cyprus should be reduced to joining the bailed-out club of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece just when it is about to take over the EU presidency.</p> <p>No one denies that it hurt when Kurt Lauk, the president of the economic council of Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, pronounced this week that putting Cyprus at the helm of the EU was tantamount to allowing \"the dog \u2026 to be put in charge of the supply of sausages\".</p> <p>With the island shut out of international markets for the past year, finance ministry officials insist that the decision to resort to the EU rescue fund will give it the breathing space to ring-fence banks operating in Greece.</p> <p>Anger at Athens is almost palpable. At \u20ac18bn, the Cypriot economy may be worth only a fraction even of tiny Greece's, but with officials calculating the bailout at around \u20ac10bn, Nicosia is mortgaging its future for decades.</p> <p>\"For the last two months we've had no government to talk to because of their idiotic decision to hold elections,\" said one official who requested anonymity. \"Had we been able to prepare beforehand, we may well have been able to ease the conditions in return for assistance. Instead, we've had to deal with their stupidities.\"</p> <p>Cypriot-owned banks account for more than 10% of Greece's entire banking system, with local lenders suffering an estimated \u20ac6bn losses following the massive restructuring of Greek debt. Buoyed by their success, banks overzealously invested in Greek government bonds. \"Our crisis is the result purely of over-exposure to Greek banks,\" said George Sklavos, a senior economist at the finance ministry. \"At 72% our debt to GDP ratio is among the lowest in the EU \u2026 yes, we could have taken measures earlier but they wouldn't have solved the problem because our problem is linked to the banking system in Greece.\"</p> <p>But the magnitude of the support now needed has sparked widespread criticism that the government has exploited the banking crisis. Faced with a presidential election next February, Christofias has been increasingly accused of hoodwinking the public into believing that state finances were better than they were declared to be. Public debt has doubled in the time the 65-year-old leader has been in office, with Cyprus's budget deficit last year hitting 6.3% of GDP compared with a budget surplus of 3.5% when it joined the euro in 2008.</p> <p>A profligate public sector, with golden handshakes and mammoth benefits handed out indiscriminately to the rich and poor, also grew as the ruling communists handed out favours.</p> <p>On the eve of Nicosia formally making its funding request, the communist leader announced that the economy had \"healthy foundations\" despite unemployment reaching a record 10%.</p> <p>In his 11th-floor office, Cyprus's former president George Vasilliou shakes his head more in sorrow than anger at his island's plight. The crisis is by far the worse since 1974 and, he says, it could have been avoided.</p> <p>\"Everyone constantly said there was no serious problem with public finances but it was obvious there was,\" he lamented. \"We needed to address it long ago \u2026 instead every effort was made to avoid facing reality.\"</p> <h2>A president out of his depth<br></h2> <p>Demetris Christofias is the only communist leader of a European state. The Russian-educated 65-year-old remains a diehard believer in the tenets of marxist-leninism. On the eve of requesting financial help, he lashed out at the European Union and International Monetary Fund for their \"colonial occupation\" of countries they had sought to rescue.</p> <p>The son of a builder, he retains good relations with Moscow and Beijing. Christofias further unnerved Brussels by insisting that he may supplement whatever financial aid Nicosia receives with a loan from Russia or China. \"He is completely out of his depth and, as the end of his term in office approaches, there is an overriding sense of failure \u2013 that he has failed the nation and himself,\" said an insider. \"The tragedy is, he isn't a bad man. He isn't corrupt. He is just corrupt ideologically and that got in the way of making essential changes to the economy.\"</p> <p>Christofias won office after pledging to reunify Cyprus's divided Greek and Turkish communities. Little progress was made in talks brokered by the UN. With the Cypriot economy now in freefall \u2013 and likely to be administered a hard-hitting austerity programme when EU and IMF officials begin assessing its true state on Monday \u2013 many believe that the veteran leftist will go down in history as perhaps the worst president since the island won independence from the British in 1960.</p>",

Royal Bank of Scotland couldn't serve its customers because its computers failed; Barclays was fined \u00a3290m for trying to manipulate the money markets; other banks will soon be confessing to the same sin and paying their own hefty fines. And now RBS, Barclays, Lloyds and HSBC \u2013 the UK's big four \u2013 are compensating small businesses who were hoodwinked into buying complex insurance that they did not need. \"What I hope is that everyone \u2013 everyone \u2013 understands that something went very wrong with the UK banking industry and we need to put it right,\" declared Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, on Friday. At one level, this was a statement of the bleedin' obvious. But King also sounded like a headmaster casting off his frustrations. He seemed to be : you've been caught red-handed and your punishment will hurt. The frustrations, perhaps, are born of banks' and bankers' successes in the past four years in protecting their power bases and privileges. In the face of regulators' demands to preserve capital, the high-pay culture has survived. Bob Diamond at Barclays collected \u00a317m last year, an astonishing sum given that the board will have known that the Libor skeleton was in the cupboard and Diamond himself had described the bank's financial results as unacceptable. Meanwhile, the debate on structural reform of the industry was overrun by barely disguised threats. Don't push us too hard, the banks warned the politicians, because we are your best hope of reviving the economy. It's a line that looks outrageous in light of the mis-selling revelations. To their credit, the commissioners on the Vickers inquiry proposed stronger reforms than seemed likely. The key proposal is that banks should construct a fence between their investment banking activities and their basic retail operations. King called for parliament to implement all the Vickers proposals as soon as possible\"leadership of an unusually high order\", even if he declined to name those leaders who fall short of this standard (not the time or the place, he pleaded). But it is the cultural and leadership failings that the Libor scandal has revealed so starkly. What the Barclays case showed was how a cultural cancer can spread within a bank and an industry. The scandal had two stages. In the first, traders cajoled their in-house colleagues to submit false data on the bank's cost of borrowing to bolster their own positions. In the second stage, \"senior management\" \u2013 not named in the Financial Services Authority report \u2013 wanted submissions to be distorted to present to the outside world a more flattering picture of Barclays' financial health during the credit crisis. Diamond, in his letter to Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, implied that the latter scam was commonplace. \"At the time, Barclays' opinion was that those other banks' submissions were too low given market circumstances,\" he wrote. In other words, Diamond is saying that up to 20 banks were lying. That's no defence but it's an extraordinary claim, and it's odds on it will turn out to be well founded. Is this the point where the scales fall from politicians' eyes? Maybe, if only because their careers are now so closely tied to the job of cleaning up banking. About \u00a3100bn of public money will soon be poured into the banks via the chancellor's \"funding for lending\" scheme. From now on, scams, fiddles and bad behaviour could rebound directly on the government. No wonder the prime minister sounds so keen for Diamond to go: if David Cameron can't force the resignation of the boss of a bank that has been shamed, a government-sponsored cultural revolution in banking looks a non-starter.",

''I was in shock and my world was destroyed. I lost everything I worked for,'' he said.</p> <p>The agreement is part of a plea deal that will see the 66-year-old sentenced to 10 years in jail.

The sum is largely symbolic as prosecutors do not believe they will recover even a fraction of that amount.</p> <p>Bernard Madoff, 74, was sentenced to 150 years in jail for orchestrating a decades-long scam that cheated thousands of people out of an estimated $20bn. At trial he denied his brother, or other family members, had anything to do with the fraud.</p> <p>Manhattan attorney Preet Bahara said that there would be more prosecutions to come. </p> <p>\"Peter Madoff enabled the largest fraud in human history.

      "bodyText": "The younger brother of mega-fraudster Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty Friday to charges he helped orchestrate the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. The FBI arrested Peter Madoff at his lawyers' office in Manhattan and took him to court where he confessed to charges including falsifying documents, filing false tax returns and lying to regulators. Madoff, his brother's long-time number two, told the judge he was ''deeply ashamed and terribly sorry'' but that he didn't know about the scam until his brother first revealed it in December 2008. ''I was in shock and my world was destroyed. I lost everything I worked for,'' he said. The agreement is part of a plea deal that will see the 66-year-old sentenced to 10 years in jail. He also agreed to forfeit $143bn, representing all the money that flowed through Madoff's accounts. The sum is largely symbolic as prosecutors do not believe they will recover even a fraction of that amount. Bernard Madoff, 74, was sentenced to 150 years in jail for orchestrating a decades-long scam that cheated thousands of people out of an estimated $20bn. At trial he denied his brother, or other family members, had anything to do with the fraud. Manhattan attorney Preet Bahara said that there would be more prosecutions to come. \"Peter Madoff enabled the largest fraud in human history. He will now be jailed well into old age, and he will forfeit virtually every penny he has. We are not yet finished calling to account everyone responsible for the epic fraud of Bernard Madoff and the epic pain of his many victims,\" he said. Peter Madoff's arrest comes more than three years after his brother confessed his once respected investment business was a giant scam. Madoff refused to co-operate with the authorities and insisted he orchestrated the scheme alone. Peter Madoff was chief compliance officer at Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities LLC when his brother was arrested on 11 December 2008. Prosecutors have not said whether criminal cases are also being prepared against Bernard Madoff's son, Andrew, who was co-director of trading, or his niece, Shana, who was a compliance officer at the firm. In May, Irving Picard, the trustee seeking money for victims of the Ponzi scheme, named members of Madoff's family in an expanded $255.3m lawsuit, claiming they should have detected Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme at the firm that operated \"as if it were their family piggy bank\". In addition to Madoff's brother Peter, Picard sued Andrew Madoff, who was co-director of trading; the estate of son Mark, co-director of trading who committed suicide in December 2010; and Shana Madoff. In the lawsuit, Picard described Peter Madoff as a savvy investor who once served as vice-chairman of the board of governors of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Picard is seeking $90.4m from Peter, $81.3m from Mark Madoff's estate, $73.8m from Andrew and $15.3m from Shana. Lawyers for Andrew and Shana Madoff did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Between 1993 and 2008, Peter Madoff was paid over $36m in salary and bonuses, Picard said, and the firm funded his lavish lifestyle, including $140,000 for a Ferrari in 1995 and a home on Manhattan's upscale Park Avenue. About a dozen people have now been implicated in criminal wrongdoing related to the Madoff firm. Five have pleaded not guilty: Annette Bongiorno, Daniel Bonventre, Joann Crupi, Jerome O'Hara and George Perez. Frank DiPascali, the former chief financial officer often called Bernard Madoff's right-hand man, pleaded guilty in August 2009 and has been praised by prosecutors for his co-operation. He has yet to be sentenced.",

      "bodyText": "Angry shareholders on Friday attacked Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke for failing to stem losses at the supermarket's US venture and \"losing touch\" with British customers. Clarke repeatedly refused to bow to shareholder pressure to set a target date for when its US business Fresh &amp; Easy \u2013 which has been in the red since it launched in 2007 \u2013 would finally begin to turn a profit. \"Fresh &amp; Easy is improving as a business and I can assure you that it is receiving close attention from the executive team,\" Clarke said. \"We believe there is great value in the business and, if we get it right, an excellent stream of growth in future years.\" However, he added that if the US stores continued to fail and there was \"no chance of success\", Tesco would make \"tough decisions\" like it did with offloading its ailing Japanese business earlier this year. But some shareholders were unconvinced, with one investor calling on Clarke to quit if the business did not begin to improve. \"Will you resign if you don't achieve them [targets] or will we have to vote you out?\" he asked at a confrontational annual meeting in Cardiff. Tesco's chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, said Clarke was \"evidently one of the best retailers in the world\" and said there was \"absolutely no prospect\" of him resigning. Broadbent added that Tesco was \"not hiding anything at all at Fresh &amp; Easy\". Earlier this year, Clarke said he did not expect the US chain to break even until its 2013/14 financial year \u2013 a year later than its previous target. This month, Tesco reported that underlying sales growth at Fresh &amp; Easy slowed to 3.6% in its first quarter compared with 12.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. Shareholders also attacked the company for its dire performance in the UK, which led to a shock profits warning \u2013 its first in decades \u2013 just after Christmas. Broadbent admitted it had been a tough year, and said the board was acutely aware that Tesco's shares have lost more than 20% of their value so far this year. Clarke conceded that Tesco has \"had a problem\" in the UK and said the UK's biggest retailer had \"allowed the shopping experience to become less appealing in a difficult economic environment\". He said Tesco was undergoing a \u00a31bn turnaround plan to recruit new staff and renovate stores, which account for about \u00a31 in every \u00a38 spent by British shoppers. Despite the tense atmosphere, Tesco avoided becoming the latest victim of the \"shareholder spring\", which has seen big revolts against directors' pay at some of Britain's biggest companies recently. The board's pay deal received the support of 96.9% of shareholders despite shareholder adviser Pirc calling on investors to vote down the \"wholly excessive\" remuneration package. Clarke may have headed off any serious rebellion by foregoing his \u00a3372,000 bonus. He still collected a pay package of \u00a31.16m last year.",

This month, Tesco reported that underlying sales growth at Fresh &amp; Easy slowed to 3.6% in its first quarter compared with 12.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.</p> <p>Shareholders also attacked the company for its dire performance in the UK, which led to a shock profits warning \u2013 its first in decades \u2013 just after Christmas. Broadbent admitted it had been a tough year, and said the board was acutely aware that Tesco's shares have lost more than 20% of their value so far this year.</p> <p>Clarke conceded that Tesco has \"had a problem\" in the UK and said the UK's biggest retailer had \"allowed the shopping experience to become less appealing in a difficult economic environment\". He said Tesco was undergoing a \u00a31bn turnaround plan to recruit new staff and renovate stores, which account for about \u00a31 in every \u00a38 spent by British shoppers.</p> <p>Despite the tense atmosphere, Tesco avoided becoming the latest victim of the \"shareholder spring\", which has seen big revolts against directors' pay at some of Britain's biggest companies recently.</p> <p>The board's pay deal received the support of 96.9% of shareholders despite shareholder adviser Pirc calling on investors to vote down the \"wholly excessive\" remuneration package.</p> <p>Clarke may have headed off any serious rebellion by foregoing his \u00a3372,000 bonus. He still collected a pay package of \u00a31.16m last year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England on Friday strongly urged UK banks to build up their defences against a possible deepening of the crisis in Europe, as it warned that recent events in the 17-nation single-currency zone posed a significant risk to financial stability. Sir Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, said building up substantial capital cushions against possible trouble ahead should be a higher priority than paying dividends to shareholders and big pay packets for employees. \"Our challenge remains one of ensuring that banks are in the best possible shape to weather the storms we are experiencing and those that may lie ahead, so that they can support lending to the real economy whatever the future may hold,\" King said at a press conference to launch Threadneedle Street's half-yearly Financial Stability Review. \"The crisis in the eurozone has generated a great deal of uncertainty around the economic outlook and exposed severe vulnerabilities in the European banking system,\" the governor said. \"The fortunes of the UK, and in particular our financial system, have inevitably been affected. That has been reflected in higher funding costs for banks and higher rates for household and corporate borrowers in the UK. Uncertainty and tighter credit conditions have acted as strong headwinds to our recovery.\" King said banks should work closely with the City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, to ensure they had enough capital to act as a shock absorber against potential losses. This might need to be above the new international guidelines drawn up after the financial crisis revealed that banks were highly leveraged \u2013 taking large risks against very little capital. King insisted it was crucial that the attempts to improve the resilience of banks should not come at a high cost to the real economy. Banks, he said, should reduce the risk of their activities. The FSA said: \"Banks have been passing through higher funding costs to the interest rates of both corporate and secured household lending. That highlights the potential for an adverse feedback loop to develop, were the economy to weaken and the quality of banks' assets to deteriorate. It added: \"The possibility of substantial economic and financial disruption in the euro area poses a significant threat to financial stability.\" The report noted that UK banks were more heavily exposed to private sector borrowers than to the banks and governments in vulnerable eurozone countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. This amounted to about \u00a3145bn \u2013 or 70% of their strongest capital cushion against collapse. \"UK banks are also indirectly exposed to vulnerable eurozone countries through their lending to other banks that have significant exposures to these countries,\" the FSA said, adding that British banks had exposure of about \u00a330bn and \u00a360bn respectively to the German and French banking sectors, both of which stood to lose massively in the event of a deepening eurozone crisis. While the report expressed confidence that the UK could deal with a Greek departure from the euro, it warned that a domino effect across Europe would be much more damaging. \"The direct impact of a Greek exit and associated redenomination appears likely to be manageable. If contagion were to spread to other euro-area countries, the extent of financial market disruption, and the potential for UK bank losses, would be significantly greater. UK banks have aggregate gross exposures to Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain equivalent to 90% of their core tier 1 capital.\" Problems would remain even if the eurozone crisis was resolved, the report said. \"The challenging financial environment poses risks to banking systems in the medium term. Risk aversion and high levels of debt in the real economy could weigh on growth. A reversal of long-term interest rates could cause disruption to financial stability. And capital inflows could potentially contribute to overheating in emerging markets, exposing UK banks to losses on their global operations.\"",

      "body": "<p>Food hygiene inspectors are concerned to find a fully made-up bed on the floor of a small, windowless room behind the busy kitchen of Sam's Great Tasting Chicken, a fast-food outlet in an east London high street. The bed has no mattress, just a sleeping bag laid on top of a couple of dirty blue blankets and neatly turned down sheets.</p> <p>It is past midnight, and the fried chicken shop is still busy, with customers but the raid by 15 officials from local and central government departments has taken the shop supervisor by surprise and he has to get dressed quickly to answer questions. In this room, tucked beside the walk-in freezer, he has all his belongings to hand: clothes, suitcases, medicine, videos, cologne, shampoos, towels drying on a radiator; he has arranged miniature statues of a leopard, dogs and owls on every available surface to cheer the place up.</p> <p>The hygiene officials are joined by tax officers who ask him if he's living in the restaurant. He denies it categorically, but can't remember where he lives and struggles to come up with a plausible postal address. \"Woodford maybe.\"</p> <p>\"Do you not know your address?\" one of the inspectors asks him. \"You must know your address.\"</p> <p>\"Fifty-eight, isn't it?\" the man asks.</p> <p>Stocked with cheap, imported chicken pieces that are fried and served with chips through the night at low prices, these shops are growing in number in Britain's high streets. They are popular with the young but increasingly unpopular with local councils, who are concerned that the cheapness of the food on sale is reflected in employees' working conditions.</p> <p>Newham council is working with the UK Border Agency, the police, tax inspectors and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to crack down on what they suspect to be widespread exploitation of staff at chicken shops throughout the borough.</p> <p>As a result of 19 raids in the past few months, the council has launched 20 national minimum-wage investigations. \"We came across one chicken shop where the pay was \u00a31 an hour. To be fair, they gave the workers some free accommodation \u2013 a mattress at the back of the shop, with three of them taking turns on it,\" Sir <a href=\"http://www.newham.gov.uk/mayor/\" title=\"\">Robin Wales</a>, the mayor of Newham, says. \"These people are desperate, just trying to do the best for themselves, but the people who employ them should be in prison. It's outrageous, lots of people are being exploited.\"</p> <p>Newham council has long been aware that there is chronic underpayment of staff and a huge problem with working conditions at the hundreds of chicken shops in this east London borough, which next month will be one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\" title=\"\">Olympic</a> hosts.</p> <p>But the council does not have the power to mount raids on suspicion of non-payment of the minimum wage. Instead, it has had to couple wage investigations with hygiene checks \u2013 because it has the right to enforce health and safety regulations \u2013 or to persuade central government tax inspectors to co-ordinate joint investigations.</p> <h2><strong>Careful planning</strong></h2> <p>During a recent raid, 30 officials split into two teams of 15 to mount evening raids on aroundabout 16 shops. The itinerary has been carefully planned to stop staff fleeing premises at one end of the high street when they see shops being raided at the other, but the evening is nevertheless hampered by managers suddenly pulling down the metal shutters over shop fronts and declaring businesses closed for the night.</p> <p>Before the teams set off, a police officer warns: \"These are chicken shops; there will be knives in them as part of their trade, so just be wary.\" Staff from the DWP benefit fraud team are wearing black protective anti-stab vests.</p> <p>At Sam's Great Tasting Chicken (which advertises itself to passers-by with a huge lit-up cartoon chicken's head, wearing a cowboy hat and a bow-tie), the dozen teenage customers buying chicken pieces are dismayed and excited to see inspectors arrive at half past midnight, and exclaim: \"What the fuck! What the fuck!\" An employee coolly continues to serve people fried chicken pieces as the officials file past him to the back of the kitchen.</p> <p>The inspectors ask the supervisor why, if he isn't living here, there are piles of letters addressed to him at this address. \"How long have you lived here?\" His English is not very good, but he explains he has moved here from Pakistan 14 years ago. \"You must know your address then.\"</p> <p>\"He has all the comforts of home here. I can't accept that he is just staying the night here,\" an inspector says.</p> <p>The man says he is paid \u00a3300 a week to work here as a supervisor, he thinks over 12 hours a day, seven days a week, which if right would work out at a rate considerably below the national minimum wage of \u00a36.08 per hour.</p> <p>He rummages around in a plastic bag, where he keeps his papers, folded in small paper chip bags (decorated with the Sam's Great Tasting Chicken logo, \"number one for quality and price\"), but he is unable to find any payslips. \"OK baby, I will fax it,\" he tells one of the officials, to her considerable surprise.</p> <p>This is not the first evidence of staff being accommodated on site. In another chicken shop visited by inspectors, food hygiene staff discover a folded camp bed, made up with blankets inside, next to a cooking stove where a vat of burnt curry is cooling down, in a store room behind the main kitchen. The owner of the establishment says he is keeping the bed there temporarily for the neighbours, but the inspectors express scepticism.</p> <p>At Fat Chaps (Best Turkish Cuisine), a middle-aged man from Uzbekistan is serving chips over the counter; the air hangs heavy with the smell of frying, and the floor is slippery with grease. A sign behind him reads: \"Please do not ask for credit as a smack in the mouth often offends.\"</p> <p>Border Agency staff ask the man for his name and passport details, and phone through the information to an immigration call centre, where officials working through the night discover that his student visa was refused in 2009. \"You will have to come with us to the police station tonight. You're under arrest for overstaying your visa,\" a police officer tells him.</p> <p>They walk upstairs with him to a bare room above the shop, where he changes out of his yellow Fat Chaps T-shirt into jeans that he takes from a suitcase under his bed, and he is taken, without protest, to the police station. A few days later he is deported.</p> <p>Officials ask the cafe's manager how much the staff are paid. He suggests, hesitantly, \u00a35.80 an hour, and admits that he doesn't know the minimum wage rate. On the other side of the cafe, another cook says he thinks he is paid about \u00a34 an hour. Throughout the evening, employees are very clear about the prices they charge for the chicken meal deals they serve, but peculiarly vague about their own pay arrangements.</p> <p>At Mighty Chicken and Ribs, at around midnight, the extractor fan is not working, the tables are unwiped and grimy, and rubbish is exploding from the bin. The only member of staff on duty, a student from Pakistan, is also unable to give precise details about his pay arrangements, and claims not to know how to contact his employer. Inspectors tell him off for leaving a half-eaten burger (his supper) behind the till and for storing the chicken on top of the bread in the freezer, along with the day's takings (wrapped in a plastic bag). \"You can't keep money in the freezer.\" Border Agency staff check his student visa, which they report is about to expire.</p> <h2><strong>Complicity</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.newham.gov.uk/YourCouncil/Non-compliancewiththeNationalMinimumWageinNewham.htm\" title=\"\">A study into the prevalence of minimum wage abuses</a> recently commissioned by Newham and carried out by Mori and the local charity <a href=\"http://www.community-links.org/\" title=\"\">Community Links</a> pointed out that employees are often \"actively complicit in hiding their employers' malpractice because they want to protect their jobs\".</p> <p>It is uncomfortable that the people most alarmed by the night of chicken shop raids are the employees: young teenage brothers from Pakistan who are obliged to show inspectors their living quarters above the shop, students from Bangladesh, who watch with growing unease as border officials check their papers. The shop owners are largely absent, and may receive notification of further action by post later.</p> <p>Sheila Roberts, the borough enforcement manager,, who has participated in a number of raids, says one employee was so frightened by their arrival that he went to hide in a freezer. She argues that the action has to be taken because employers who do not pay the minimum wage are often violating other regulations, and their staff may not feel able to report injuries or problems.</p> <p>There are hundreds of chicken shops in Newham, and although some of them do operate legitimate businesses, inspectors say it is rare to visit one and not find some kind of irregularity. The raids are partly an attempt to clear the area before the Olympics, she says: \"We don't want visitors to come to Newham and have negative experiences.\" More importantly, officials \"don't want Newham's residents to be exploited\", she says. \"These are vulnerable people.\"</p> <p>Sir Robin Wales has no affection for chicken shops. \"There's too many chicken shops; there's too much litter; they attract problems. But the main thing is they're selling really, really cheap chicken to kids,\" he says. To be able to sell such cut-price food, \"very cheap, poor quality chicken\" is used and employees are paid very little.</p> <p>\"Good employers are finding it hard to compete. Why should people who are paying the minimum wage have to compete with these people? It makes sense for us to cut out this exploitation of people. While a raid like this will be difficult for those people [who are being exploited], ultimately if we catch people who don't pay the national minimum wage, then we can stop it. You have to do it.\"</p>",

Inspectors tell him off for leaving a half-eaten burger (his supper) behind the till and for storing the chicken on top of the bread in the freezer, along with the day's takings (wrapped in a plastic bag). \"You can't keep money in the freezer.\" Border Agency staff check his student visa, which they report is about to expire. Complicity A study into the prevalence of minimum wage abuses recently commissioned by Newham and carried out by Mori and the local charity Community Links pointed out that employees are often \"actively complicit in hiding their employers' malpractice because they want to protect their jobs\". It is uncomfortable that the people most alarmed by the night of chicken shop raids are the employees: young teenage brothers from Pakistan who are obliged to show inspectors their living quarters above the shop, students from Bangladesh, who watch with growing unease as border officials check their papers. The shop owners are largely absent, and may receive notification of further action by post later. Sheila Roberts, the borough enforcement manager,, who has participated in a number of raids, says one employee was so frightened by their arrival that he went to hide in a freezer. She argues that the action has to be taken because employers who do not pay the minimum wage are often violating other regulations, and their staff may not feel able to report injuries or problems. There are hundreds of chicken shops in Newham, and although some of them do operate legitimate businesses, inspectors say it is rare to visit one and not find some kind of irregularity. The raids are partly an attempt to clear the area before the Olympics, she says: \"We don't want visitors to come to Newham and have negative experiences.\" More importantly, officials \"don't want Newham's residents to be exploited\", she says. \"These are vulnerable people.\" Sir Robin Wales has no affection for chicken shops. \"There's too many chicken shops; there's too much litter; they attract problems. But the main thing is they're selling really, really cheap chicken to kids,\" he says. To be able to sell such cut-price food, \"very cheap, poor quality chicken\" is used and employees are paid very little. \"Good employers are finding it hard to compete. Why should people who are paying the minimum wage have to compete with these people? It makes sense for us to cut out this exploitation of people. While a raid like this will be difficult for those people [who are being exploited], ultimately if we catch people who don't pay the national minimum wage, then we can stop it. You have to do it.\"",

More than \u00a34bn has been wiped off the value of the bank since the rate-fixing scandal emerged.</p> <p>\"It is time to do something about the banking system\", the governor said.</p> <p>As he warned the outlook for financial stability had deteriorated as a result of the deepening crisis in the eurozone, King dismissed mounting calls for a Leveson-style investigation into banks saying that enough was already known to implement root and branch reform of the City.</p> <p>But Ed Balls, the shadow Chancellor, said such an inquiry was needed. \"The governor is right to say that there is a real cultural problem in our banks which these latest scandals expose and I don't think it is right for government ministers or for the governor, actually, to say we have had enough inquiries,\" said Balls.</p> <p>King said: \"Many people in the banking industry are hard-working and feel badly let down by some of their colleagues and leaders.</p> <p>\"It goes to the culture and the structure of banks \u2013 the excessive compensation, the shoddy treatment of customers, the deceitful manipulation of a key interest rate, and today news of yet another mis-selling scandal.\"</p> <p>Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were yesterday ordered by the Financial Services Authority to pay redress to small business customers after finding \"serious failings\" in the way they were sold complex financial products intended to protect them from interest rate rises. The revelations caused outrage among business groups with the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI all condemning the fleecing of their business members. John Longworth, director general at the BCC, said the latest scandal would \"damage business' perception of banks further\".</p> <p>After 72 hours of sustained attack on Diamond, the Barclays boss made clear he would not voluntarily step down. The bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, is also in the firing line and may be forced out in an attempt to show that a boardroom executive is paying the price for the record-breaking \u00a3290m fine and damage to its reputation.

      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has piled the pressure on the scandal-ridden City when he said something had gone \"very wrong\" with Britain's banks that needed to be put right. As Barclays and other high street banks became embroiled in a new misselling scandal, King launched his most scathing attack yet on the culture of banking in the five-year long financial crisis. King refused to say Bob Diamond was a \"fit and proper\" person to run Barclays as the reputational damage from an interest rate fixing fine led to another fall in the bank's shares. More than \u00a34bn has been wiped off the value of the bank since the rate-fixing scandal emerged. \"It is time to do something about the banking system\", the governor said. As he warned the outlook for financial stability had deteriorated as a result of the deepening crisis in the eurozone, King dismissed mounting calls for a Leveson-style investigation into banks saying that enough was already known to implement root and branch reform of the City. But Ed Balls, the shadow Chancellor, said such an inquiry was needed. \"The governor is right to say that there is a real cultural problem in our banks which these latest scandals expose and I don't think it is right for government ministers or for the governor, actually, to say we have had enough inquiries,\" said Balls. King said: \"Many people in the banking industry are hard-working and feel badly let down by some of their colleagues and leaders. \"It goes to the culture and the structure of banks \u2013 the excessive compensation, the shoddy treatment of customers, the deceitful manipulation of a key interest rate, and today news of yet another mis-selling scandal.\" Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were yesterday ordered by the Financial Services Authority to pay redress to small business customers after finding \"serious failings\" in the way they were sold complex financial products intended to protect them from interest rate rises. The revelations caused outrage among business groups with the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI all condemning the fleecing of their business members. John Longworth, director general at the BCC, said the latest scandal would \"damage business' perception of banks further\". After 72 hours of sustained attack on Diamond, the Barclays boss made clear he would not voluntarily step down. The bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, is also in the firing line and may be forced out in an attempt to show that a boardroom executive is paying the price for the record-breaking \u00a3290m fine and damage to its reputation. Barclays shareholders are thought to be considering appointing a figurehead to conduct a review of the culture inside Barclays. The political pressure continued to mount on Diamond. Asked whether Diamond was the right man to lead Barclays, the prime minister said: \"I can't say that. He has questions to answer.\" Cameron's remarks mirrored those of King and Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, who both declined the opportunity twice to say that Diamond was \"fit and proper\" to run Barclays. Barclays was on Wednesday fined a record \u00a3290m for attempting to manipulate crucial interest rates known as the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor) between 2005 and 2009 both of which are crucial in setting the price at which customers borrow for the mortgages. The fine was published alongside a series emails showing how traders helped each other to try to manipulate interest rates with promises of Bollinger champagne and quips like \"this is for you, big boy.\" Sir Roger Carr, president of employers' body CBI, said: \"The manipulation of the Libor arrangements is deplorable and undermines international trust in the integrity of the City. The weakness must be addressed and the culprits punished\". King added that the question of who ran the UK banks was a question for another day, insisting that the immediate priority was for the government to implement in full the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking headed by Sir John Vickers, which called for firewalls to be set up between the investment and retail arms of banks.

      "body": "<p>The United States Federal Reserve's recent announcement that it will extend Operation Twist by buying an extra $267bn (\u00a3171bn) of long-term Treasury bonds over the next six months \u2013 to reach a total of $667bn this year \u2013 had virtually no impact on either interest rates or equity prices. The market's lack of response was an important indicator that monetary easing is no longer a useful tool for increasing economic activity.</p> <p>The Fed has repeatedly said that it will do whatever it can to stimulate growth. This led to a plan to keep short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014, as well as to massive quantitative easing, followed by Operation Twist, in which the Fed substitutes short-term Treasuries for long-term bonds.</p> <p>These policies did succeed in lowering long-term interest rates. The yield on 10-year Treasuries is now 1.6%, down from 3.4% at the start of 2011. Although it is difficult to know how much of this decline reflected higher demand for Treasury bonds from risk-averse global investors, the Fed's policies undoubtedly deserve some of the credit. The lower long-term interest rates contributed to the small 4% rise in the S&amp;P 500 share-price index over the same period.</p> <p>The Fed is unlikely to be able to reduce long-term rates any further. Their level is now so low that many investors rightly fear that we are looking at a bubble in bond and stock prices. The result could be a substantial market-driven rise in long-term rates that the Fed would be unable to prevent. A shift in foreign investors' portfolio preferences away from long-term bonds could easily trigger such a runup in rates.</p> <p>Moreover, while the Fed's actions have helped the owners of bonds and stocks, it is not clear that they have stimulated real economic activity. The US economy is still limping along with very slow growth and a high rate of unemployment. Although the economy has been expanding for three years, the level of GDP is still only 1% higher than it was nearly five years ago, when the recession began. The GDP growth rate was only 1.7% in 2011, and it is not significantly higher now. Indeed, recent data show falling real personal incomes, declining employment gains, and lower retail sales.</p> <p>The primary impact of monetary easing is usually to stimulate demand for housing and thus the volume of construction. But this time, despite historically low mortgage interest rates, house prices have continued to fall and are now more than 10% lower in real terms than they were two years ago. The level of real residential investment is still less than half its level before the recession began. The Fed has noted that structural problems in the housing market have impaired its ability to stimulate the economy through this channel.</p> <p>Business investment is also weak, even though large corporations have very high cash balances. With so much internal liquidity, these businesses are not sensitive to reductions in market interest rates. At the same time, many very small businesses cannot get credit, because the local banks on which they depend have inadequate capital, owing to accrued losses on commercial real-estate loans. These small businesses, too, are not helped by lower interest rates.</p> <p>The Fed's monetary easing did temporarily contribute to a weaker dollar, which boosted net exports. But the dollar's decline has more recently been reversed by the global flight to safety by investors abandoning the euro.</p> <p>Even if the US economy continues to stumble in the months ahead, the Fed is unlikely to do anything more before the end of the year. The next policy moves to help the economy must come from the US Congress and the administration after the November election.</p> <p>Nonetheless, what needs to be done is already clear. The cloud of a sharp rise in personal and corporate income tax rates, now scheduled to occur automatically at the start of 2013, must be removed. The projected increase in the long-term fiscal deficit must be reversed by stemming the growth in transfers to middle-class retirees. Fundamental tax reform must strengthen incentives, reduce distorting \"tax expenditures\", and raise revenue. Finally, the relationship between government and business, now quite combative, must be improved.</p> <p>If these things happen in 2013, the US economy can return to a more normal path of economic expansion and rising employment. At that point, the Fed can focus on its fundamental mandate of preventing a rise in the rate of inflation. Until then, it is powerless.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Feldstein, professor of economics at Harvard University, was chairman of President Ronald Reagan's council of economic advisers and is a former president of the US National Bureau for Economic Research.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012.</p>",

The Fed has repeatedly said that it will do whatever it can to stimulate growth. This led to a plan to keep short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014, as well as to massive quantitative easing, followed by Operation Twist, in which the Fed substitutes short-term Treasuries for long-term bonds. These policies did succeed in lowering long-term interest rates. The yield on 10-year Treasuries is now 1.6%, down from 3.4% at the start of 2011. Although it is difficult to know how much of this decline reflected higher demand for Treasury bonds from risk-averse global investors, the Fed's policies undoubtedly deserve some of the credit. The lower long-term interest rates contributed to the small 4% rise in the S&amp;P 500 share-price index over the same period. The Fed is unlikely to be able to reduce long-term rates any further. Their level is now so low that many investors rightly fear that we are looking at a bubble in bond and stock prices. The result could be a substantial market-driven rise in long-term rates that the Fed would be unable to prevent. A shift in foreign investors' portfolio preferences away from long-term bonds could easily trigger such a runup in rates. Moreover, while the Fed's actions have helped the owners of bonds and stocks, it is not clear that they have stimulated real economic activity. The US economy is still limping along with very slow growth and a high rate of unemployment. Although the economy has been expanding for three years, the level of GDP is still only 1% higher than it was nearly five years ago, when the recession began. The GDP growth rate was only 1.7% in 2011, and it is not significantly higher now. Indeed, recent data show falling real personal incomes, declining employment gains, and lower retail sales. The primary impact of monetary easing is usually to stimulate demand for housing and thus the volume of construction. But this time, despite historically low mortgage interest rates, house prices have continued to fall and are now more than 10% lower in real terms than they were two years ago. The level of real residential investment is still less than half its level before the recession began. The Fed has noted that structural problems in the housing market have impaired its ability to stimulate the economy through this channel. Business investment is also weak, even though large corporations have very high cash balances. With so much internal liquidity, these businesses are not sensitive to reductions in market interest rates. At the same time, many very small businesses cannot get credit, because the local banks on which they depend have inadequate capital, owing to accrued losses on commercial real-estate loans. These small businesses, too, are not helped by lower interest rates. The Fed's monetary easing did temporarily contribute to a weaker dollar, which boosted net exports. But the dollar's decline has more recently been reversed by the global flight to safety by investors abandoning the euro. Even if the US economy continues to stumble in the months ahead, the Fed is unlikely to do anything more before the end of the year. The next policy moves to help the economy must come from the US Congress and the administration after the November election. Nonetheless, what needs to be done is already clear. The cloud of a sharp rise in personal and corporate income tax rates, now scheduled to occur automatically at the start of 2013, must be removed. The projected increase in the long-term fiscal deficit must be reversed by stemming the growth in transfers to middle-class retirees. Fundamental tax reform must strengthen incentives, reduce distorting \"tax expenditures\", and raise revenue. Finally, the relationship between government and business, now quite combative, must be improved. If these things happen in 2013, the US economy can return to a more normal path of economic expansion and rising employment. At that point, the Fed can focus on its fundamental mandate of preventing a rise in the rate of inflation. Until then, it is powerless. \u2022 Martin Feldstein, professor of economics at Harvard University, was chairman of President Ronald Reagan's council of economic advisers and is a former president of the US National Bureau for Economic Research.

There are certainly no oases of prosperity in the face of yet another major shock in the global economy. America's growth mirage is an important case in point. \u2022 Stephen S Roach, a member of the faculty at Yale University, was formerly chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and is the author of The Next Asia. \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2012.",

      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond is facing fresh pressure about the conduct of Barclays bank after the Financial Services Authority cited it as one of four high street banks that missold financial products to small businesses. Bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland as well as Barclays and HSBC will be required to pay redress to customers who lost out as a result of products they were sold to protect against movements in interest rates over the past 10 years, under an agreement reached with the City regulator in the early hours of Friday morning. The discovery of \"serious failings\" in the sale of these so-called interest rate swaps comes as the banking industry is mired in controversy about manipulating interest rates following the record-breaking \u00a3290m fine slapped on Barclays on Wednesday. Diamond is refusing to quit despite David Cameron's call for accountability at the top of the bank in what has been described as a \"shocking indictment\" of the banking industry culture.
