It paid \u00a3360m in a highly leveraged deal, but in the property market collapse the company found itself unable to make its debt repayments.</p> <p>This led to the Bank of America and Mizuho taking control of the business until BC Partners invested a further \u00a350m and last year bought back the business from the banks.</p> <p>Hunt subsequently used the cash from the sale to build a property empire which has left him worth an estimated \u00a3925m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.</p> <p>Around 50% of the issued share capital in Foxtons will be available at the flotation and a dividend of between 35% to 40% of profits after tax has been suggested, with the possibility of special dividends.</p> <p>The current management team will remain in place, with Michael Brown as chief executive and Gerard Nieslony chief financial officer.</p> <p>BC Partners will also have a non-executive director from the company on the board. The chairman will be serial boardroom member Garry Watts, who is chairman of Spire Healthcare and deputy chairman of Stagecoach Group.</p> <p>Foxtons issued a note of caution ahead of the float, warning: \"The directors believe that residential property sales transaction volumes in London may recover, although the extent and the timing of any recovery is uncertain.\"</p> <p>But housebuilders and estate agents have been broadly optimistic, especially in London, after the introduction of government schemes to boost the housing market, Funding for Lending and Help to Buy.</p> <p>In March the UK's biggest estate agent, Countrywide, launched a successful flotation and upmarket housebuilder Crest Nicholson also returned to the stock market. Countrywide shares jumped 12.5% on their first day of trading.</p> <p>Foxtons has performed strongly this year, reporting underlying profits up 14.3% to \u00a319.4m in the first six months of the year on revenues of \u00a362.6m.</p> <p>The average Foxtons property sale price was \u00a3476,000 in 2012 and it sells properties in the \u00a3200,000 to \u00a31.4m sales brackets, charging an average commission of 2.5%.</p> <p>One in three houses sold in the City, one in four flats in Ladbroke Grove and one in five flats in Chelsea was sold through Foxtons last year, according to the company.</p>",

Bosses at the agents, known for its branded fleet of Mini Coopers and brightly-coloured offices, are expected to make around \u00a3100m from the float which is likely to value the business at up to \u00a3500m when it lists next month. The current owners, private equity group BC Partners, will sell some of its shares along with the directors, in a listing that marks the end of an impressive turnaround of fortunes for its investment. BC Partners bought Foxtons from founder Jon Hunt at the height of the property boom in 2007. It paid \u00a3360m in a highly leveraged deal, but in the property market collapse the company found itself unable to make its debt repayments. This led to the Bank of America and Mizuho taking control of the business until BC Partners invested a further \u00a350m and last year bought back the business from the banks. Hunt subsequently used the cash from the sale to build a property empire which has left him worth an estimated \u00a3925m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Around 50% of the issued share capital in Foxtons will be available at the flotation and a dividend of between 35% to 40% of profits after tax has been suggested, with the possibility of special dividends. The current management team will remain in place, with Michael Brown as chief executive and Gerard Nieslony chief financial officer. BC Partners will also have a non-executive director from the company on the board. The chairman will be serial boardroom member Garry Watts, who is chairman of Spire Healthcare and deputy chairman of Stagecoach Group. Foxtons issued a note of caution ahead of the float, warning: \"The directors believe that residential property sales transaction volumes in London may recover, although the extent and the timing of any recovery is uncertain.\" But housebuilders and estate agents have been broadly optimistic, especially in London, after the introduction of government schemes to boost the housing market, Funding for Lending and Help to Buy. In March the UK's biggest estate agent, Countrywide, launched a successful flotation and upmarket housebuilder Crest Nicholson also returned to the stock market. Countrywide shares jumped 12.5% on their first day of trading. Foxtons has performed strongly this year, reporting underlying profits up 14.3% to \u00a319.4m in the first six months of the year on revenues of \u00a362.6m. The average Foxtons property sale price was \u00a3476,000 in 2012 and it sells properties in the \u00a3200,000 to \u00a31.4m sales brackets, charging an average commission of 2.5%. One in three houses sold in the City, one in four flats in Ladbroke Grove and one in five flats in Chelsea was sold through Foxtons last year, according to the company.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has denied that its insistence on Nationwide holding a bigger capital cushion had forced the UK's largest building society to slow its launch of small business lending. Nationwide admitted plans to expand lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are unlikely to take effect until 2014 at the earliest. It said plans to begin lending to smaller firms were still under development but \"moving slowly\"; , it denied a report that it had shelved a planned launch date for later this year. A spokesman for Nationwide said: \"We are building our expertise in this area and hiring people experienced in working with SMEs.

A spokesman added: \"The plan agreed with Nationwide to meet the 3% leverage ratio in 2015 will not result in them restricting lending to the real economy. Therefore it is wrong to blame their SME decision on the regulator.\" The lender's slowness to offer loans to SMEs will disappoint ministers concerned that small firms continue to be starved of credit. Nationwide's entry into the market has been seen by business secretary Vince Cable as a way to increase competition and break the dominance of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. However, regulators warned the lender had rapidly expanded its mortgage business while still wrestling with an overhang of bad commercial property loans. It was rebuked in July by the regulator, the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), for running an aggressive lending policy without adequate reserves to insure against a possible collapse. Analysts at credit ratings firm Standard &amp; Poor's followed with a warning that a doubling in the losses on commercial property loans to \u00a3450m weakened the lender's financial position. S&amp;P downgraded Nationwide's credit rating this month and signalled that further downgrades could follow without a rapid improvement. \"These impairment charges have hindered Nationwide's internal capital generation. As a result, we have revised down our assessment of its risk position to 'adequate' from 'strong',\" it said.

      "bodyText": "And that's a good moment to stop for the day. My colleagues will be tracking the Syria situation in our Middle East blog: Syria crisis: live updates. I'll be back tomorrow, when Bank of England governor Mark Carney's will give his maiden speech in Nottingham. Until then, goodnight and thanks for the comments. GW. Some late news from France -- the number of people out of work hit a new record high in July. The total registered as out of work increased by 6,300 to 3,285,700 people - a 0.2% rise on June's figure. This means the French jobless total has increased for the last 27 months. As Reuters points out, president Francois Hollande promised to get unemployment falling by the end of 2013. Time is running out... While European stock markets ended the day down, the oil price continues to climb this evening. Brent crude is now up $3.50 per barrel, or over 3%, at $114.29, while New York crude is up a similar amount to $108.98. As Shires of England pointed out in the comments section below, this could be bad news for the eurozone's recovery: CMC's Michael Hewson makes the same point: If prices are sustained at these levels we could well see some form of demand destruction which could derail some of the recent recovery in Europe\u2019s economies. It wasn't a great day for Turkey, where the lira weakened to a new record low against the US dollar and the stock market tumbled by around 4.7. This followed a less-than-inspiring performance by its central bank governor, who urged investors to 'believe in me and win', before revealing he would soon be off on a short holiday. Business Insider has the details. Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at IG, says today's stock market selloff was due to three factors - increased tensions with Syria, continued uncertainty regarding US Federal Reserve tapering and trouble in the eurozone. She writes Jitters in equity markets were felt from the open, as the likelihood of a US-led military response to the tensions in Syria heightened. The resulting lack of clarity and ongoing uncertainty with respect to Fed tapering has prompted investor profit-taking with the banks, with resource stocks bearing much of the brunt. On the flipside, the precious metals market is firmly in the black, with Fresnillo adding 7.97% on sturdier gold and silver prices. Randgold Resources was also in favour, adding 5.61%. Political uncertainty in Italy is adding to trouble in the eurozone; the mere notion that financial reforms will not go ahead has negatively impacted Italian prices and weighed on the Italian bourse. Elsewhere, the German IFO business climate index beat expectations, rising to 107.5 from last month\u2019s 106.2, but the data did little to pacify investor caution. The prospect of yet another bailout for Greece was an additional fly in the ointment, and Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras has stated that an additional smaller amount may be required in 2014. Here's the biggest risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 today: Europe's stock markets have posted their biggest fall in two months, after a day of nervous trading dominated by the prospect of military action against Syria. Trading just finished for the day, with heavy losses on some indices. That knocked 1.5% off the FTSEurofirst 300 \u2013 made up of shares from across Europe \u2013 which is its biggest daily drop since June 24 (according to Reuters data). Volatility in the markets also jumped by the most since February. Rikin Thakrar, senior dealer at Spreadco, commented: The markets are jittery as Russia and Iran issued strong warnings against any Western military action. The trouble in Syria, along with U.S. debt ceiling worries and tapering talk, have put stock markets firmly on the back foot. Here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 51 points at 6440, - 0.8% \u2022 German DAX: down 192 points at 8242, -2.28% \u2022 French CAC: down 98 points at 3968, -2.4% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 255 points at 8394, -3% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 397 points at 16579, -2.3% And still the oil price keeps climbing, with both Brent Crude and NYMEX light crude (the two benchmarks) now up by over $3 per barrel today. Over in Greece, a business group has warned that tens of thousands more small firms will collapse by the end of this year. That's despite a bank recapitalisation programme that was meant to shore up its economy. Associated Press has the details: A survey is warning that some 40,000 small businesses in Greece are likely to close in the second half of 2013 at a cost of up to 90,000 jobs despite a major bank rescue program implemented before the summer. However, the small business survey conducted by the Hellenic Confederation of Professionals, Craftsmen and Merchants (GSEVEE) between July 10 and 16 and published Tuesday found that the 50 billion euro ($66.7 billion) bank recapitalization was likely to result in a modest decline in the rate of closures, from an estimated 55,000 in the first half of the year. In an encouraging sign for the US economy, American consumer confidence has risen this month - with people feeling more confident about their employment and earning prospects. That's according to the latest figures from the Conference Board. Its monthly measure of consumer outlook (full details here) spiked to 81.5 points, much healthier than July's reading of 80.3 and beating expectations of a fall to 79.0. The 'future expectations' section of the report shows a significant rise, while the 'current conditions' measure declined a little. Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators, explained: Consumers were moderately more upbeat about business, job and earning prospects. In fact, income expectations, which had declined sharply earlier this year with the payroll tax hike, have rebounded to their highest level in two and a half years. Consumers\u2019 assessment of current business and labor market conditions, on the other hand, was somewhat less favorable than last month. No impact on the stock market, though, with the Dow now down 111 points. As predicted, shares dropped once Wall Street opened as US traders react to the latest developments over Syria. The Dow Jones industrial average is down around 90 points, or 0.6%, at14850, amid speculation that a Western strike against the Assad government could come within days (the UK parliament will vote on the issue on Thursday) The Greek stock market is also suffering -- down over 4% today. A quick round-up of the situation in the European markets: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 58 points at 6434 ,- 0.9% \u2022 German DAX: down 175 points at 8260, - 2% \u2022 French CAC: down 84 points at 3982, - 2.1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 222 points at 8428, - 2.5% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB : down 406 points at 16572, - 2.4% Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, summed it up: A better than expected reading on the German IFO Business Survey this morning (9.11am onwards) wasn\u2019t enough to drag European indices from the doldrums, as concerns over the unravelling political situation in Italy and the escalating violence in Syria weigh on market sentiment. Wall Street is expected to be hit by the Syria crisis when trading begins in half an hour - following the losses in Europe and Asia today. The oil price has now hit a six-month high as the chances of a military strike on Syria within days appear to keep rising. Brent crude has jumped by two dollars per barrel to $112.68, the highest level since late February. This graph shows how it has climbed steadily through the day, reaching its highest levels after prime minister David Cameron announced that the UK parliament is being recalled to debate the situation on Thursday. (reminder, my colleagues are tracking all the Syrian news here: Syria crisis: US forces 'ready to go' if ordered, says Hagel - live updates). And with stock markets still down (round-up to follow), funds have flowed into gold -- pushing it up to $1,420 per ounce. That's a 20% increase on the lows recorded in June - meaning gold is officially a Bull Market: Away from the market moves, Spanish police have now confirmed that they've arrested a former JP Morgan trader facing charges over the \"London Whale\" case. Javier Martin-Artajo, who two weeks ago was charged in America over the $6bn+ trading scandal, handed himself into the authorities in Madrid after being contacted by investigators. Bloomberg has the details: He turned himself in this morning after being contacted by investigators, a Spanish police official said today. Police have passed his case to the National Court in Madrid. \u201cThe arrested person is presumed responsible for manipulating and inflating the value of positions in the synthetic credit portfolio of his firm with the aim of achieving specific objectives of daily losses and gains,\u201d police said in a statement. Court insiders say that Martin-Artajo has now been released from custody \u2013- but can't leave Spain while his case is considered. More here. Hungary's central bank just announced its thirteenth interest rate cut in as many months. The Hungarian National Bank voted to ease monetary policy again by cutting its benchmark interest rate from 4% to 3.8%. That's a deeper cut than analysts had expected. Syria is also being blamed for a rise in the gold price today, which has hit an 11-week high of $1.420 per ounce. Another factor, though, is the ongoing uncertainty about how America will ease up on its monetary stimulus measures (by 'tapering' its $85bn-per-month bond buying programme). Natixis analyst Nic Brown commented: Geopolitical tensions in Syria are one of the factors which will be supporting gold prices in coming sessions. And you also have the latest data out of the United States over the past couple of sessions that was relatively weak and raised the question mark over the timing of the U.S. Fed tapering. The escalating tensions over Syria have drived oil prices up to near five-month highs this morning. Energy traders anticipating supply disruption after the UK government revealed that 'contingency plans' for military action are underway (see our Middle East liveblog for full details). The cost of a barrel of Brent crude is up one dollar this morning to $111.8.8, the highest levels since early April: Yassir Mckee, wealth manager at Qatar's Al Rayan Financial Brokerage, blames the 7% slide on the Dubai stock market today (11.15am) on the Syria situation, and reckons it's an over-reaction. Politically, the region is a mess and concerns of war in Syria are high. But the extent of the drop doesn\u2019t make sense and people are over-reacting because local fundamentals are strong and even if there is a war, I don't see it significantly impacting Gulf countries. (via Reuters). Dubai's stock market has tumbled by almost 7% today - shedding 189 points to 2552. That's looks like its biggest one-day drop since November 2009, when the emirate was gripped by its own debt crisis in late 2009 (in the early days of this liveblog). The Saudi stock market has also fallen sharply today, down 3%. This comes as the Syrian government hits back at the US, accusing secretary of state John Kerry of lying and exploiting recent events (full details in our Middle East liveblog) David Madden, market analyst at IG, says European markets are also being hit by concerns that Greece will require a third financial aid package. He explains: In mid-morning trading the FTSE 100 is down 60 points as traders are concerned that Greece may need another bailout. The eurozone may be out of its recession but the single currency area is only as strong as it weakest link, and it looks like the Athens administration may require a third bailout. Angela Merkel must strike a balance between keeping the eurozone on track without alienating the German electorate as she faces re-election next month. The Greek economy is on track for its sixth consecutive contraction and traders are afraid that we are in a constant loop of bailouts. Those Greek fears were fanned by finance minister Yannis Stournaras over the weekend, when he suggested that Athens might seek a third bailout of around \u20ac10bn (with no additional austerity measures) when its existing package runs out in 2014. Stournaras told the Greek Proto Thema newspaper that: If there is need for further support to Greece, it will be in the order of about 10 billion euros ($15 billion), or much smaller than the previous programmes. adding that the support would be advanced \"without new terms\" as Greece's existing cuts programmes run until 2016. This \u20ac10bn figure has been knocking around for some time - the IMF identified it back in January. It's much smaller than Greece's two existing bailout packages, but it poses political challenges given so much Greek debt is now in public hands. The suggestion that Athens wouldn't (couldn't?) accept any further austerity in return adds to the uncertainty... For all the latest developments on Syria and the Middle East, you should be following my colleague Peter Walker's live blog: Syria crisis: discussions continue over intervention - live updates Europe's stock markets have fallen steadily in the first two hours of trading, as Western governments continue to consider military intervention in Syria (see opening post for more details). There are chunky losses on the main indices, with the FTSE 100 currrently down almost 1%. The prospect of military reaction to last week's chemical weapons attack in Damascus dominates attention - here are the latest newswire snaps from the Reuters terminal: 27-Aug-2013 09:58 - BRITISH PM CAMERON THINKS SYRIAN CHEMICAL ATTACK IS 'ABSOLUTELY ABHORRENT' AND THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST RESPOND - PM'S SPOKESMAN 27-Aug-2013 09:58 - BRITAIN IS CONSIDERING 'PROPORTIONATE RESPONSE' TO SUSPECTED CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN SYRIA - PM'S SPOKESMAN 27-Aug-2013 09:58 - BRITAIN MAY HAVE A STRATEGIC NEED TO ACT QUICKLY IN SITUATIONS SUCH AS SYRIAN CHEMICAL ATTACK, BUT HAS TAKEN NO DECISION SO FAR - PM'S SPOKESMAN 27-Aug-2013 09:58 - CAMERON'S SPOKESMAN SAYS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT BRITAIN'S ARMED FORCES ARE MAKING CONTINGENCY PLANS ON HOW TO RESPOND TO SUSPECTED CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA Italy's stock market has added to yesterday's falls amid the political instability triggered by Silvio Berlusconi''s tax fraud conviction. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 57 points at 6434, - 0.9% \u2022 German DAX: down 121 points at 8313, -1.4% \u2022 French CAC: down 55 points at 4011. -1.3% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 266 points at 16,712, - 1.5% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 148 points at 8, 501, -1.7% The news that confidence among German companies is now at a 16-month high (9.11am onwards) has not distracted from the situation in the Middle East. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, commented: Jittery stock markets this Tuesday on the prospects of US military intervention in Syria affecting risk-sentiment. Even stronger than expected German IFO survey [consistent with the progress in all German economic indicators] have failed to put a smile on the markets\u2019 face. The rising confidence among German firms (see 9.11am) confirms that Europe's largest economy is safely on the road to recovery. However, that could be derailed if, for example, the West undertakes military action in Syria. Here's some early reaction (via the Reuters terminal): Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank: The German economy is picking up steam. The rise in the business climate index completes a string of solid economic data released over the past week. The robust German domestic economy and the better than expected situation in struggling euro zone countries drove the improved outlook. The consequences of the worsening situation in Syria are not yet included in the Ifo index. If it came to a military attack on the Assad regime, uncertainty among businesses would grow again. Moreover the international environment is difficult given sluggish global trade. Carsten Brzeski of ING: The German economy continues surfing on the waves of optimism. Today\u2019s Ifo index fits perfectly into the set of positive and encouraging latest macro data ... Both, the expectation and the current assessment component improved, providing further signs that fears of a sharp slowdown in the second half of the year should have been overdone. To the contrary, prospects for the German economy remain good. Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics: The sharper than expected rise in German Ifo business sentiment adds to encouraging signs that the economy is recovering. On past form, the business climate index now appears consistent with annual GDP growth of nearly 3 percent, compared to Q2\u2019s 0.5 percent. [But] We doubt that the recovery will be this rapid. Other surveys like the PMI point to far more modest growth and exports will continue to be held back by weak demand from key markets elsewhere in the euro-zone. Germany firms say conditions have improved this month, and are also more upbeat about future prospects. Thart's according to the monthly IFO survey, just released, which has beaten market expectations -- hitting a 16-month high. Here's the details: \u2022 IFO business climate index for August: 107.5 points, up from 106.2 in July (and beating forecasts of 107.0). The highest figure since April 2012. \u2022 Current conditions index: 112 points, up from 110.1 in July (beating the 111.0 forecast) \u2022 Expectations index: 103.3 points, up from 102.4 in July (beating the 103.0 forecast) Another sign that Germany's economy is picking up pace.... The prospect of another nail-biter over the US debt ceiling is looming \u2013 giving the markets another reason to fret. Last night, Treasury secretary Jack Lew warned that America's economy would suffer 'irreparable harm' unless Congress agrees a deal quickly, giving the government permission to increase its borrowings. Otherwise, Washington might find itself unable to pay its bills in just two months. Our Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe reported: In a letter to Republican House speaker John Boehner that sets the stage for another round of budgetary brinkmanship, Treasury secretary Jack Lew said: \"Congress should act as soon as possible to protect America's good credit.\" Lew warned failure to act soon could do \"irreparable harm\" to the US economy. Government officials and economists had been expecting the US to reach its $16.69tn \"debt ceiling\" this autumn, but mid-October is earlier than some had expected. More here: US to hit debt ceiling in mid-October, Treasury secretary warns House GOP To Italy, and Reuters flags up that the Berlusconi problem could flare up on Wednesday. The trigger is a long-running sore -- an unpopular tax on house owners which Berlusconi's PDL party has vowed to abolish. Disagreement over a housing tax and a looming vote on whether to expel former premier Silvio Berlusconi from parliament after he was convicted of tax fraud have raised worries about the stability of Italy's government. Prime Minister Enrico Letta has set a deadline of a government meeting on Wednesday for a deal on the housing tax, while a Senate committee is due to begin hearing arguments on Berlusconi's case on Sept. 9. Italian 10-year bond yields rose 4 basis points on the day to 4.43 percent, widening the gap over benchmark German Bund yields to 254 basis points. \"A combination of lingering worries over the ruling coalition and concession ahead of upcoming supply suggests Italy will struggle to make any headway near-term,\" RIA Capital Markets strategist Nick Stamenkovic said. The major Asian markets all lost ground overnight: \u2022 Japan's Nikkei: closed down 93 points at 13542, - 0.69% \u2022 Hong Kong's Hang Seng: down 84 points at 21921. - 0.4% European stock markets all fell in early trading, with the German DAX and French CAC both dropping around 0.5% at the open. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says there's also concern over the US economy after data yesterday showed a big drop in orders for durable manufacturing goods: Bourses in Asia were lower across the board on heightened geo-political tensions and the weaker than expected US Durable Goods data yesterday. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped 35 points at the start of trading, but then clawed some of the losses back (currently down just 0.25%). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of news and analysis across the financial markets, the global economy and the eurozone. Geopolitical tensions are hitting the financial world today, as Western governments moved closer to the brink of taking military action against Syria. The Turkish lira has fallen to a new record low against the US dollar in early trading, hitting the 2 lira to the dollar mark for the first time. This follows last night's hard-hitting warning from secretary of state John Kerry, who said the Syrian regime would be held accountable for last week's chemical weapons attack in the country. Full story here. Asian stock markets have already lost ground, and analysts expect European markets to follow suit through the day (I'll have the early prices shortly). Jonathan Sudaria, a sales trader at London Capital Group, summed up the situation thus: The apparent certainty that military action against Syria is on its way has traders highly uncertain about what the repercussions will be for igniting a powder keg in such an already volatile region. Naturally, traders will be shying away from risky assets until there is some clarity about the future path of military intervention from the West. The oil price is also inching higher this morning, pushing Brent Crude up by 0.2% to almost $111 per barrel. A relatively modest move - reflecting uncertainty over whether military action is likely without a UN Mandate (diplomatic editor Julian Borger explains the situation here). The Syrian crisis isn't the only issue causing market jitteriness. Italy's political situation is looking increasingly fraught, as MPs from Silvio Berluconi's party threaten to quit the coalition government if their talisman is banned from public office following his tax fraud conviction. Yesterday, the Milan stock markets shed over 2%, and Italian borrowing costs rose. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: In Italy markets, are once again, having to absorb the political brinksmanship that has come to epitomise Italian politics for years and years, and once again it is Silvio Berlusconi at the forefront of events as members of his party threatened to withdraw support from the government if Berlusconi is expelled from Parliament. Given recent history you would think markets would be used to how Italian politics works by now but given the stakes it isn\u2019t surprising that yields have edged higher and stocks have fallen. So, there could be an interesting day ahead, particularly with speculation mounting that Greece will need further aid next year [details to follow]. I'll be tracking all the developments through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Tiffany, the New York-based jeweller, said its second-quarter profits were up 16% to $106m (\u00a368.3m) driven by strong sales in China. The company, which sponsored Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, said revenue from stores open at least a year were up 5%. Total sales for the quarter were $956m. Defying the continued fallout from the eurozone crisis, sales in mainland Europe and the UK were up 11%. Sales in the Americas were 2% higher overall and, in Japan, they fell 14%, dragged down by a weaker yen. But Asia-Pacific sales climbed 20%, led by strong results in China, which is considered a bellwether for the luxury market. The results came as figures showed Americans' confidence in the economy inched closer to its highest point in five-and-a-half years on growing optimism that hiring and wages could pick up in coming months. The Conference Board said today that its consumer confidence index rose to 81.5 in August, up from 81 in July and just below June's 82.1 reading, which was the highest since January 2008. Consumers' income expectations, which fell this year after a January tax increase, rebounded to the highest level in two-and-a-half years, said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's economic indicators. Although consumers were more confident about the future, their assessment of the economy dipped slightly in August. Consumers' confidence in the economy is watched closely because their spending accounts for about 70% of US economic activity. After hitting bottom at 25.3 in February 2009, the index has bounced back, but it has yet to attain a reading of 90, which signals a healthy economy.",

But in answer to the question what did you last eat, then nearly every meal I can say local.  I only eat out once or twice a month and prefer local restaurants to chains.  I hardly shop at Supermarkets and by 85% of my stuff from small local shops.  I cook as much food myself as I can.  My last meals have been roasted veg on one night, a good mix of carrot, swede, beetroot, spring onions, mushroom, calabrese and peppers.  The night before  I had the same sort of mix but this time stir fried with the addition of a few nuts and kale.  I usually cook in olive or coconut oil.  As we are in Grimsby then I sometimes eat fish.  I realise my diet and approach to food isn&#x27;t typical and the work I do is to encourage more people to buy local and healthily.  It would be a real boost to have someone like Jamie Oliver pay an interest in our small social enterprise.

If you're going past a market, you can just grab 10 mange tout for dinner that night, and you don't waste anything.\" But how much do Oliver's comments really stack up with the reality for British consumers?

Continuing uncertainty over when the US Federal Reserve will begin easing its asset buying programme, one of the key supports for the market, is adding to the downbeat mood. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote> Jittery stock markets this Tuesday on the prospects of US military intervention in Syria affecting risk-sentiment. Even a stronger than expected German IFO survey [consistent with the progress in all German economic indicators] has failed to put a smile on the markets' face. <br> Oil prices have crept up on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, while safe haven bonds in Europe \u2013 UK gilts and German bunds \u2013 are in favour on the risk-averse tone seen in the market this morning. We also have to remember now that with a relatively respectable US and European earnings season now wrapping up, investors are likely to spend most of the session deciphering economic data out of the US. </blockquote> <p>Among the miners, <strong>Antofagasta</strong> has fallen 23p to 892p after first half earnings declined by 31.2%, hit by lower copper prices.</p> <p><strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> is down 7.1p at 216.5p and Rio Tinto has dropped 66.5p to 3002.5p.</p> <p>But <strong>Petrofac</strong> has put on 44p to \u00a313.09p after the oil services group - whose shares have been heavily shorted on concerns about its move into a challenging offshore market - said it expected a stronger second half performance. First half revenues dropped 12.5% but this was in line with City expectations. Analyst Andrew Whittock at Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> The shares have been weak this year following [an] earlier downgrade of expectations, fewer new contract awards than hoped, concerns over fixed price contacting and doubts over the investment in a high-spec installation vessel. We do not share the market's concerns. We retain our 1550p price target and believe Petrofac is good value with potentially significant growth to be delivered from new Integrated Energy Services and Engineering &amp; Construction businesses. <br> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> has climbed 11.9p to 483.5p in the wake of an upgrade from Citigroup, which has moved from neutral to buy with a target price lifted from 470p to 535p. Citi said:</p> <blockquote> The combination of recent, material upgrades to UK economic growth forecasts, and M&amp;S management initiatives have markedly improved the credibility of double-digit 2015 and 2016 M&amp;S earnings per share growth forecasts. We argue that this should underpin the group's current undemanding valuation metrics. <br> Primarily as a consequence of significant IT, logistics and supply chain investment programmes over the last 3-4 years, M&amp;S General Merchandise should begin to see both revenue and gross margin improvements from 2014. </blockquote>",

Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, said: Jittery stock markets this Tuesday on the prospects of US military intervention in Syria affecting risk-sentiment. Even a stronger than expected German IFO survey [consistent with the progress in all German economic indicators] has failed to put a smile on the markets' face. Oil prices have crept up on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, while safe haven bonds in Europe \u2013 UK gilts and German bunds \u2013 are in favour on the risk-averse tone seen in the market this morning. We also have to remember now that with a relatively respectable US and European earnings season now wrapping up, investors are likely to spend most of the session deciphering economic data out of the US. Among the miners, Antofagasta has fallen 23p to 892p after first half earnings declined by 31.2%, hit by lower copper prices. Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation is down 7.1p at 216.5p and Rio Tinto has dropped 66.5p to 3002.5p. But Petrofac has put on 44p to \u00a313.09p after the oil services group - whose shares have been heavily shorted on concerns about its move into a challenging offshore market - said it expected a stronger second half performance. First half revenues dropped 12.5% but this was in line with City expectations. Analyst Andrew Whittock at Liberum Capital said: The shares have been weak this year following [an] earlier downgrade of expectations, fewer new contract awards than hoped, concerns over fixed price contacting and doubts over the investment in a high-spec installation vessel. We do not share the market's concerns. We retain our 1550p price target and believe Petrofac is good value with potentially significant growth to be delivered from new Integrated Energy Services and Engineering &amp; Construction businesses. Elsewhere Marks &amp; Spencer has climbed 11.9p to 483.5p in the wake of an upgrade from Citigroup, which has moved from neutral to buy with a target price lifted from 470p to 535p. Citi said: The combination of recent, material upgrades to UK economic growth forecasts, and M&amp;S management initiatives have markedly improved the credibility of double-digit 2015 and 2016 M&amp;S earnings per share growth forecasts. We argue that this should underpin the group's current undemanding valuation metrics. Primarily as a consequence of significant IT, logistics and supply chain investment programmes over the last 3-4 years, M&amp;S General Merchandise should begin to see both revenue and gross margin improvements from 2014.",
