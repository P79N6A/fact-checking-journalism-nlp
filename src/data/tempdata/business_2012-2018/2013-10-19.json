      "bodyText": "It was, in the words of one industry executive, the drink of \"students, tramps and the Wurzels\". But the perception and popularity of cider has been transformed and now the government wants to get in on the act. Defra and its agency UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) have published a plan to improve British exports \u2013 and cider seems to be its trump card. \"As one of the world's leading cider producers, the UK is well placed to leverage this growing opportunity,\" the plan says. \"Worldwide, cider sales are rising rapidly and grew by over 50% in both the USA and Australia in 2011-12.\" The drink's place in what David Cameron calls the \"global race\" for growth is a remarkable turnaround for a product whose appeal was once limited to under-age drinkers and those seeking cheap strong booze. Paul Bartlett of the National Association of Cider Makers said he was delighted the government was waking up to \"a gem\", and hoped that with promotion and trade missions, cider could enjoy some of the success of Scotch whisky. He added: \"There's growth in Canada, the US, Australia and Scandinavia. And there are pockets in Asia, where hopefully the government are going to help. We are looking at Vietnam, Korea, China. It's the holy grail to crack those markets. \"The American beer market has changed dramatically with the rise of craft beers. Consumers are experimenting with different flavours, and looking at the provenance of their drinks. Cider is jumping on the back of that, offering a natural background, the direct link with apples. And men and women both like it, which is important because more drinking is in mixed groups.\" Henry Chevalier of Suffolk's Aspall Cyder pointed out that cider is being sold at the top end of the market in America. Restaurants, he said, include Aspall cider on their wine lists, at $26 a bottle, considerably more than its \u00a32.59 UK price tag. Waiters show the label to drinkers before offering a taste, and they store it in ice buckets. Billboards advertising English cider varieties have appeared in Sydney, exploiting a growing awareness of the drink. And British farmers are waking up to the potential and turning over land to apple orchards. Chevalier said the change in cider's fortunes came when Bulmers' Irish rival, Magners, launched in Britain in 2005. The following year brought a hot summer and a multi-million pound Magners marketing campaign to encourage serving cider over ice made it the trendy new drink. But there were other factors in play. \"If you go back 15 years, the image was tramps, students and the Wurzels. It was very cheap, it wasn't the best quality and there was a vicious price war going on between Bulmers and Taunton. But when Bulmers owner Scottish &amp; Newcastle was bought by Heineken [in 2008], it was the first time an internationally minded company got hold of a big cider brand. The parochial view was that there was nowhere to sell cider except England. Heineken disagreed, and others have followed.\"",

That would not just ease the pain for hard-pressed households but help to make recovery sustainable too.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there's also a far less rosy scenario to consider. A good chunk of the rise in spending that has helped to power the recovery so far has relied on consumers dipping into their savings, or ramping up borrowing. As <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/other/monetary/trendsjuly13.pdf\" title=\"\">the Bank of England's quarterly trends in lending report</a> underlined last week, unsecured borrowing \u2013 on credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans \u2013 has picked up sharply since mid-2012.</p> <p>That's fine if the spree is followed through with a pick-up in real wages; but if not, consumers' enthusiasm for spending is likely to peter out rapidly.</p> <p>Equally, a powerful upturn in exports would help lift UK plc to solid ground \u2013 hence Osborne's jaunt to China last week \u2013 but with the eurozone, still our major market, just clambering out of recession, that looks highly unlikely.</p> <p>There are some encouraging signs of a manufacturing renaissance. But output from the sector was actually lower in August than a year earlier, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_329605.pdf\" title=\"\">according to the latest official figures</a>, and since manufacturing now makes up little more than 10% of GDP, after decades of attrition, it would take an impressive improvement to drive the economy forward.</p> <p>So while we should give at least one cheer this week that Britain has finally emerged from the doldrums, it's still far from clear that this recovery has staying power \u2013 and the \"cost of living crisis\" could yet become not just a neat political slogan for the opposition, but a brake on growth.</p> <h2>Rich pickings for Ahrendts at Apple?</h2> <p>Angela Ahrendts will give up many things when she swaps her Burberry trenchcoat for an Apple Mac next year. In exchange for the keys to Apple's 415 shops, the American fashion executive will say so long to her 80% Burberry staff discount, a \u00a325,000 a year clothing allowance \u2013 and the right to call herself the boss.</p> <p>As chief executive of a FTSE 100 company Ahrendts is at the top of the corporate tree in Britain. At Apple she will be a divisional manager reporting to Tim Cook. That <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/oct/18/angela-ahrendts-burberry-apple\" title=\"\">transition is an unusual one</a> and raised eyebrows among London executives last week.</p> <p>Apple appears to be gaining more from the move than Ahrendts. Cook wants to take his company into technology's next big thing, wearable computing. Her business is clothes. Cook is also desperate to crack China, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone\" title=\"\">iPhone</a> is outsold by Samsung and five domestic brands little-known outside of their home market. Her efforts at Burberry have made the famous check a must-have among China's new rich, who contribute 14% of the British clothing firm's income.</p> <p>Apple is also keen to maintain its price premium, and Ahrendts understands luxury, having rescued the Burberry brand from over-licensing, cheap imitations and a not always flattering association with street style.</p> <p>Apple's rather aloof image has served it well, but the brand could benefit from better interaction with its followers. Burberry's social media efforts have made customers feel part of the design process, with Instagram images from inside the studios and backstage at the catwalk shows.</p> <p>For Ahrendts, for now, Apple offers the chance to return home, with a golden hello that will no doubt be eye-watering. And of course <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/apple-stores-ahrendts-struggle-demand\" title=\"\">Apple's $19bn a year in retail revenues</a> dwarf Burberry's. The princely sums paid for the luxury electronics on minimalist displays in Apple's steel and glass showrooms generate record sums per square foot.</p> <p>But in time, there could be a bigger prize. If the rumoured<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/10/smartwatch-apple-iwatch\" title=\"\"> iWatch</a> sells as well as the iPhone, Ahrendts will share the glory. If the venture flops, Cook could pay the ultimate price for having the courage to step into Steve Jobs's shoes. And the board may look to internal candidates for a successor.</p> <h2>Grangemouth dispute caught in a timewarp<br></h2> <p>Fans of the 1970s-set cop drama <em>Life on Mars </em>would have been forgiven for thinking that they were watching its industrial sequel last week. The dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery between Ineos, Britain's biggest private company, and Unite, Britain's largest trade union, seems a throwback to the bad old days. Unite has used the classic union tools, from a strident media campaign to a strike vote, but it is Ineos that has taken the most unreconstructed path. Its threat to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/17/grangemouth-oil-refinery-d-day-ineos\" title=\"\">shut down Scotland's largest oil refinery permanently unless 1,300 staff agree pension changes</a> smacks of crude brinkmanship. Staff have been told to agree to the changes \u2013 including the scrapping of a final salary scheme \u2013 by Tuesday or face the termination of their livelihoods.</p> <p>Amid the clamour, much-needed debate over pension reforms and the state of the European refining industry has been squeezed out. The reputations of Ineos and of trade unionism have both been damaged.</p>",

For the coalition, a strong reading would provide both fresh evidence that the UK has, as the chancellor puts it, turned a corner, and a welcome distraction from Labour's focus on the \"cost of living crisis\". At first glance, the turnaround since the early months of 2013, when many analysts feared the UK was about to slide into a double-dip recession, could hardly be more marked. Consumer confidence has bounced back; the long-moribund housing market has been coaxed back to life even outside the capital; and retail sales are rising, helped by all the carpets and kitchens homebuyers need to kit out their new nests. And employment has risen steadily, so that the latest official figures showed more people in jobs in the UK than ever before. Labour will inevitably reply that with real incomes in relentless decline, it doesn't feel like a recovery for most. That's absolutely right, and last week's latest double-digit price rise (in some areas) from British Gas merely served to highlight the grinding struggle many families face in making ends meet from one week to the next. But the \"cost of living crisis\" is more than a politically convenient truth for Labour \u2013 it may ultimately be what makes the nascent recovery unsustainable. There is an optimistic scenario: the upturn in the housing market, and the accompanying bounce in confidence, boosts not just retail sales, but the \"animal spirits\" of Britain's businesses too. As firms ramp up investment and production to respond to the hoped-for improvement in demand, productivity should start to rise and, with it, real wages, helping consumers to carry on spending without dipping into the red.

So while we should give at least one cheer this week that Britain has finally emerged from the doldrums, it's still far from clear that this recovery has staying power \u2013 and the \"cost of living crisis\" could yet become not just a neat political slogan for the opposition, but a brake on growth. Rich pickings for Ahrendts at Apple? Angela Ahrendts will give up many things when she swaps her Burberry trenchcoat for an Apple Mac next year. In exchange for the keys to Apple's 415 shops, the American fashion executive will say so long to her 80% Burberry staff discount, a \u00a325,000 a year clothing allowance \u2013 and the right to call herself the boss. As chief executive of a FTSE 100 company Ahrendts is at the top of the corporate tree in Britain. At Apple she will be a divisional manager reporting to Tim Cook. That transition is an unusual one and raised eyebrows among London executives last week. Apple appears to be gaining more from the move than Ahrendts. Cook wants to take his company into technology's next big thing, wearable computing. Her business is clothes. Cook is also desperate to crack China, where the iPhone is outsold by Samsung and five domestic brands little-known outside of their home market. Her efforts at Burberry have made the famous check a must-have among China's new rich, who contribute 14% of the British clothing firm's income. Apple is also keen to maintain its price premium, and Ahrendts understands luxury, having rescued the Burberry brand from over-licensing, cheap imitations and a not always flattering association with street style. Apple's rather aloof image has served it well, but the brand could benefit from better interaction with its followers. Burberry's social media efforts have made customers feel part of the design process, with Instagram images from inside the studios and backstage at the catwalk shows. For Ahrendts, for now, Apple offers the chance to return home, with a golden hello that will no doubt be eye-watering. And of course Apple's $19bn a year in retail revenues dwarf Burberry's. The princely sums paid for the luxury electronics on minimalist displays in Apple's steel and glass showrooms generate record sums per square foot. But in time, there could be a bigger prize. If the rumoured iWatch sells as well as the iPhone, Ahrendts will share the glory. If the venture flops, Cook could pay the ultimate price for having the courage to step into Steve Jobs's shoes. And the board may look to internal candidates for a successor. Grangemouth dispute caught in a timewarp Fans of the 1970s-set cop drama Life on Mars would have been forgiven for thinking that they were watching its industrial sequel last week. The dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery between Ineos, Britain's biggest private company, and Unite, Britain's largest trade union, seems a throwback to the bad old days. Unite has used the classic union tools, from a strident media campaign to a strike vote, but it is Ineos that has taken the most unreconstructed path. Its threat to shut down Scotland's largest oil refinery permanently unless 1,300 staff agree pension changes smacks of crude brinkmanship. Staff have been told to agree to the changes \u2013 including the scrapping of a final salary scheme \u2013 by Tuesday or face the termination of their livelihoods. Amid the clamour, much-needed debate over pension reforms and the state of the European refining industry has been squeezed out. The reputations of Ineos and of trade unionism have both been damaged.",

      "bodyText": "Back in the mid-1960s, the average investor on the London Stock Exchange would hold a share for eight years. In today's short-termist City that average has fallen to just seven months, with critics warning that \"high-frequency trading\" is pushing many holding periods down to just a few seconds. It's a culture Neil Woodford is determined to challenge. The City kingmaker, who ejects FTSE 100 bosses from their jobs and manages controlling stakes in many of Britain's biggest companies, rocked the asset management industry last week when he announced his departure after 25 years at fund manager Invesco Perpetual. Since 1988, Woodford has amassed \u00a333bn in the funds he manages, and become the guardian of the savings \u2013and hopes \u2013 of hundreds of thousands of small investors. To them, he is Britain's answer to Warren Buffet and, like Buffet, he is a fierce critic of his own industry. When grilled by the business select committee earlier this year, Woodford ran through a litany of fund management ills. Other fund managers buy and sell too often \u2013 Woodford typically holds shares for 12 or 13 years. Others talk about engagement, but few walk the walk. \"Lots of people vote but do not say or do any corporate engagement\u2026 I am an exception in the industry. I take corporate engagement very seriously and I spend a lot of time on it.\" Financial incentives \u2013 from commission for advisers to annual bonuses for fund managers \u2013 acted against the interests of long-term savers, he said. \"The short-termism exists at almost every link in the chain between saver and company. We need to tackle that short-termist culture in each segment of the chain.\" It helps that Woodford, 53, shares few of his peers' traits. The man who wields such financial power is no Oxbridge-educated City type with a lavish office in the Square Mile. He works in an unassuming business park on a side street in Henley-on-Thames. A farmer in his spare time \u2013 he has a degree from Exeter in agricultural economics \u2013 Woodford got his break during the technology bubble. As his peers piled into internet stocks, Woodford opted instead for the least fashionable part of the market: the tobacco stocks other investors believed doomed. But British American Tobacco, one of Woodford's biggest holdings, was the stellar performer of the noughties, beating every stock in the FTSE 100 between 2000 and 2010. Even today, Woodford holds more than \u00a31bn of BAT shares. His statement this week was short but telling: \"My decision to leave is a personal one based on my views about where I see long-term opportunities in the fund management industry.\" Long-termism lies at the heart of Woodford's extraordinary \u00a333bn in funds, and he dismisses short-term setbacks almost cheerfully. This week his two major funds, Invesco Perpetual Income and High Income, were languishing in the bottom segment of the performance tables. Over one year, High Income is ranked 72nd of 101 funds in its sector \u2013 hardly what many would expect of a hero fund manager. But Woodford cares little for one-year performance. The pharmaceutical stocks he has moved heavily into in recent years \u2013 GlaxoSmithKline is now his biggest holding \u2013 have so far failed to sparkle. Glaxo is up over the past year, but trails the rise in the FTSE 100. Woodford, however, is prepared to wait:.\"I am absolutely convinced that in the long term, valuation and fundamentals of a company are the only things that matter and, like gravity, those things will reassert themselves,\" he told the BBC. \"The biggest challenge for me, I suppose, is holding my nerve...\" But Woodford's views on long-term investing should not be interpreted as a desire to back British companies come what may. When MPs pressed Woodford over the sale of Cadbury to Kraft \u2013 described as \"a pretty glaring example of short-termism in takeover situations,\" by Brian Binley MP \u2013 Woodford was curt: \"Cadbury was sold in the end because the long-term shareholders accepted.\" Quite how much will flow out of Invesco to Woodford's new venture when it opens next April is a matter of intense speculation. Other fund management groups are hoping to grab a slice, too, gently reminding investors that Woodford's record isn't quite as magnificent as the headlines suggest. Gary Potter, co-founder of the Navigator fund-of-funds operation, says JO Hambro's UK Equity Income fund, run by Clive Beagles, has outperformed Woodford's funds over the past five years, making a 128% gain for investors, compared with 71% at Invesco Perpetual. Many advisers are tipping Adrian Frost of Artemis Income and High Income to pick up Woodford's mantle, and with nearly \u00a36bn under management, he's part-way there already. But for advisers, buying Woodford in the past decade has been like buying IBM equipment in the 1960s \u2013 no one ever got fired for doing so. Alan Miller, who helped set up New Star Asset Management with John Duffield, reckons Woodford The Sequel will be a big success. \"Whatever Invesco Perpetual says publicly about Woodford's departure, it creates a significant problem\u2026 Neil's new company will attract funds and be stunningly successful.\"",

      "bodyText": "This year will be a very mobile Christmas, according to retailers, who predict that the number of presents bought online from smartphones and tablets will more than double. Nearly a quarter of all online sales now come from shoppers, either on the move or on the sofa, selecting purchases from handheld devices. But in the coming weeks retailers expect mobile spending to increase dramatically, with some of the busiest shopping hours likely to be before breakfast and during the most popular evening TV shows. Mark Lewis, online director of the John Lewis store group, where more than a quarter of sales, worth \u00a31bn a year, now come via the internet, said: \"We expect this Christmas to be a tipping point, where the majority of our online sales come from mobile devices.\" It is a trend repeated across the high street, and will take another leap forward as more people find smartphones and tablets in their Christmas stockings. More than half of the eight million tablets sold in the UK last year were bought in the last three months of the year. This year more than eight million are expected to fly off the shelves in the run-up to Christmas, helped by the launch of Apple's new iPad, and the arrival of cheap tablets such as Tesco's Hudl and Argos's MyTablet. As soon as they are unwrapped many of these devices will be put to use to snap up sale bargains. On Christmas Day last year \u2013 when the John Lewis sale was already under way online \u2013 half of the department store's traffic came from mobile devices. This year it is expecting that to jump to two-thirds as more households try out the new technology. \"There was a surge at 3pm on Christmas Day, just after the Queen's speech, as people tried out their presents \u2013 and we expect that again this year,\" said Lewis. At Marks &amp; Spencer, about a quarter of online sales on Christmas Day came via iPads alone. Laura Wade-Gery, digital director at Marks &amp; Spencer, said: \"We are expecting another big jump this Christmas. There are so many devices and they are becoming more affordable.\" The new technology is, in turn, leading to changes in when and how people shop. Early morning has never before been a big shopping time, but an increasing number of sales are now made online between 6am and 8am. Lewis said: \"People use their phone as an alarm, then check their emails, follow a link, and are shopping before they even get out of bed.\" He said these early-bird shoppers buy anything from electrical goods to fashion, and retailers are responding to this shift by timing marketing emails for when they will attract most interest. Online luxury goods site Vente-privee.com has keyed into the trend by launching discount \"events\" at 7am in France, its biggest market, and at 6am in the UK, one of its fastest-growing regions. Around 400,000 women across Europe log in at that time every day. Co-founder Ilan Benhaim said the early morning slots were initially a way to even out visitor numbers and avoid website crashes, but had proved extremely popular. \"We get clients saying 'Please don't change it because I shop before my shower or taking the kids to school'.\" Mobiles are also driving sales at other unusual times of day. Wade-Gery at M&amp;S said some of the most popular products on its mobile site were for school uniforms, with 3.30pm one of the peak sales periods. \"Mums are waiting for their kids at the school gate when they realise they have forgotten that polo shirt,\" she explains. The biggest surges in shopping via tablets, however, come in the evening, around 8pm or 9pm, as people browse the virtual aisles while watching TV. \"They have Corrie on in the background and are on their sofas having a browse,\" said Lewis. It is the hi-tech equivalent of the surge in electrical use as the nation puts on the kettle for a cuppa after the news. \"There are spikes in online traffic whenever the ads are on,\" added Lewis. This phenomenon, known as second-screening, has turned online shopping into a leisure activity, and made Sunday nights an important sales period. In previous years there was a \"mega-Monday\" in the first week of December when shoppers went online to begin gift buying via their computers at work. This year retailers reckon it could be replaced by a \"cyber-Sunday\" as more people shop from the sofa. Shoppers are also using their gadgets for research. They might check something out on the phone while waiting at the bus stop, pop into a store at the weekend for a closer look, then order it from a laptop on Sunday night, for delivery to home, work or a local store. And people expect all of these \"channels\" to work together seamlessly as the revolution in shopping habits gathers pace. Lewis, an uber-geek with a first- class maths degree from Cambridge and a six-year stint at eBay behind him, said: \"The next five years will be the most disruptive and interesting five years in the history of retail in our lifetime.\"",

The IMF makes money by borrowing and lending, taking a \"turn\". In 2007 it was short of customers. Then along came the world financial crisis, and the fund was back in business. Alternative plans for financing itself were shelved. The recent annual meeting of the IMF in Washington was overshadowed by the threat of another famous organisation facing an operational crisis \u2013 no less an entity that the one responsible for overseeing the most powerful economy in the world, namely the government of the United States of America. The shenanigans over the partial shutdown of US government activities, which began some weeks earlier \u2013 and the threat of escalation when the legislative ceiling on what the US could borrow was reached \u2013 have made a laughing stock of a constitutional system that sees one of its missions to bring democracy to the Middle East and elsewhere. James Madison, a revered \"founding father\" of the US constitution, was anxious that minorities should not be tyrannised by majorities. In recent years it has been the remarkable achievement of the extreme rightwing faction of the Republican party to ensure that a minority \u2013 the Tea Party \u2013 has tyrannised the majority: not only the majority of the Republican party itself, but also the majority of the US electorate, to say nothing of the majority of the rest of the world, given the potential ramifications of a default by the US on its financial obligations. It got to the stage last weekend when one seasoned observer of the congressional scene said: \"In any other country such an impasse would be resolved by the dissolution of the government and a general election. But not here.\" Under the constitution as it has evolved, the \"system\" is one of too many checks and not enough balances. Things have reached a pretty pass when one finds the Chinese regime telling Washington to get its act together. And it took a sensational plunge in the Republican party's ratings in the opinion polls for it finally to come to its senses. Apart from anything else, as Lawrence Summers pointed out in the Washington Post, the deadlock diverted attention from the need for a fundamental change of economic strategy. \"If even half the energy that has been devoted over the past five years to 'budget deals' were devoted instead to 'growth strategies', we could enjoy sounder government finances and a restoration of the power of the American example,\" wrote Summers. For all the fuss about the putative \"crisis\" of the US deficit, the congressional budget office's forecast is that the deficit will fall to 2% of GDP by 2015. By comparison with the UK and eurozone, the US economy has recovered relatively well from the 2008-09 low point \u2013 averaging real growth of 2% a year. Its recovery could have been a lot faster, but there has been a conflict between monetary policy (interest rates and quantitative easing) and fiscal policy (taxation and public spending). Nearly all the public comment is focused on the Federal Reserve, with its brief to aim for low inflation and maximum employment. Yet there is a limit to what is achievable when fiscal policy is working forcibly in the opposite direction. Federal Reserve estimates suggest that, if it were not for the fiscal squeeze, the US economy might reasonably be expected to have grown by 3.5% per cent this year, not 2%, although the recent disruption to government service might have tempered that somewhat. The point about fiscal policy is that there is a big difference between what's inappropriate in the short term, during recession or emergence from recession, and longer-term issues associated with, for example, an ageing population and the associated implications for the cost of healthcare. In this context it has been quite remarkable how poor the financial markets have been in judging the prospects for the Fed's actions with regard to cutting back the monetary stimulus. The retiring chairman, Ben Bernanke, has been commendably consistent in pointing out that, while in the long term interest rates will be encouraged to return to normal levels, in the short term unemployment remains significantly higher than before the onset of the financial crisis. It was pretty obvious from Bernanke's remarks over the summer that a \"tightening\" of monetary policy would be premature. This impression ought to have been strengthened by concerns about the behaviour of the Republicans in recent months. There was a certain historical echo in the way that 17 October was the \"make or break\" day for the debt ceiling. It was on the same day 40 years ago, in 1973, that the Middle East oil producers announced production cuts and oil price increases in the wake of the Yom Kippur war \u2013 the \"oil shock\" that led to a quintupling of the price of crude and the first major recession since the second world war. Policymakers eventually adapted to the world of dearer energy. In 2009-10 their successors, with the much-maligned Gordon Brown playing a major leadership role, \"saved the world\". But there are few signs that the present crop of policymakers have understood there is a time and a place for budget-cutting, and that is not when the recovery is still fragile.",
