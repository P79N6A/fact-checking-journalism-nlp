      "bodyText": "The mining lobby has called for environmental charities to be banned from using more than 10% of their expenditure on advocacy, as a high-stakes battle over the public voice of charities and NGOs intensifies. A paper released by the Australia Institute on Friday in turn accused the foreign-funded Minerals Council of Australia of spending millions of tax-deductible dollars on political advocacy aimed at reducing its tax liabilities. A Treasury inquiry is considering changes to the rules on which organisations can claim deductible gift recipient status \u2013 the latest stage in a long-running campaign by the Coalition government, miners and some media outlets to limit the advocacy activities conducted by environmental NGOs. The inquiry has sought \u201cstakeholder views\u201d on a list of recommendations made by parliamentary inquiries established by the Coalition. They include the proposal to force environmental charities to devote up to 50% of their expenditure to \u201cremediation\u201d and monitor more closely the advocacy activities of all charities. The Minerals Council of Australia released its submission to the inquiry this week, in which it calls for a further gagging of charities\u2019 advocacy roles, suggesting they be banned from using more than 10% of their expenditure on advocacy. Currently, charities are allowed to engage in advocacy but it must not include \u201cpromoting or opposing a political party or candidate for political office\u201d. The Minerals Council submission contains eight pages of photographs of campaigns by environmental and progressive charities it says break that rule. The submission also calls for the identity and location of donors to charities that engage in advocacy to be revealed \u2013 an issue not raised in the Treasury discussion paper but one that has been raised by another parliamentary inquiry that proposed banning foreign donations to all groups that spend money on political activity. Not revealing the identity of those donors, the submission says, \u201cconstitutes a potential threat to Austalia\u2019s [sic] sovereignty, by allowing foreign interests to exert political influence by covertly funding domestic environmental groups\u201d. But on Friday the Australia Institute \u2013 itself a registered charity \u2013 released a paper analysing the degree of tax-deductible advocacy engaged in by foreign-funded mining lobby groups such as the Minerals Council. It found the Australian mining industry was 86% foreign-owned and had spent more than half a billion dollars lobbying Australian governments over the past decade \u2013 most of which would have been a tax deduction for the companies, resulting in forgone tax revenue of about $162m. The report lays out ways in which the foreign-funded mining lobby has exerted political influence, most of which has aimed at reducing the tax revenue collected from those miners. The report notes: Lobbying by Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton has prevented an inquiry into the $75bn-a-year iron ore industry. The Minerals Council lobbies to maintain subsidies and tax concessions for mining companies that cost Australian taxpayers billions every year. In 2013, taxpayers paid $4.5bn in subsidies and concessions to the mining industry. The mining industry spent at least $100m from 2010-12 lobbying for the repeal of the minerals resource rent tax, or \u201cmining tax\u201d, which budget papers estimate has reduced tax revenue by $5.3bn. Hannah Aulby from the Australia Institute, author of the report, said: \u201cForeign corporate mining interests are attempting to influence government to help increase their profits. They are not acting in the public interest and in fact can distort sound economic decision making.\u201d Aulby said many Australians thought of some of the big miners as Australian companies but they were mostly foreign-owned. BHP is 76% foreign owned and Rio Tinto 83%, meaning both companies are officially foreign corporations under Australian law, the report noted. The push to gag environmental groups has been seen as a threat to the whole charity sector by some in the industry. The Australian Council for International Development (Acfid) \u2013 the body representing Australia\u2019s international development organisations \u2013 strongly opposed the proposed limits to the advocacy activities of charities in its submission to the Treasury inquiry. \u201cCharities undertaking advocacy has been recognised as both a legitimate activity and one essential to our system of parliamentary democracy,\u201d their submission says. \u201cIt is an important approach which charities can use to address the causes of social and environmental problems, rather than just the symptoms \u2013 an approach that often requires seeking policy change.\u201d The chief executive of Acfid, Mark Purcell, told the Guardian the attack on environmental groups was the \u201cthin edge of the wedge\u201d. \u201cIn a liberal democracy you can\u2019t go around trying to shut down groups on the basis of their activities. If they are carrying out work that is of benefit to the community and they\u2019re doing that consistent with their charitable purpose then that\u2019s the test. It should not be governments arbitrarily setting percentages of how much of particular activities you can do.\u201d Labor\u2019s spokesman on charities and not-for-profits, Andrew Leigh, said the government \u201cseems to think that charities should be seen but not heard\u201d. \u201cLabor disagrees. We believe that charities and non-profits have an important role to play in advocating for a better world,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if the Turnbull government started working with the non-profit sector, rather than waging a non-stop war on charities?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boots has cut the price of emergency contraception weeks after it sparked outrage by refusing to do so in case it encouraged women to have sex. The high street chemist announced on Thursday that it had started to sell a new, cheaper generic version of the morning-after pill in 38 of its stores and would make it available in all 2,500 by October. \u201cWe have listened to our customers\u2019 feedback and we committed to sourcing a less expensive emergency hormonal contraceptive to enable us to make a privately funded EHC service more accessible in the future,\u201d Boots said. \u201cWe can confirm that four weeks ago we started the rollout of this service to 38 stores and have been offering it with a new, less expensive generic version of EHC (Levonorgestrel) at a cost of \u00a315.99, which reflects the cost of the medicine and the regulated mandatory consultation with the pharmacist.\u201d Even at \u00a315.99, it is still \u00a32.49 more expensive than the \u00a313.50 that competitor pharmacies \u2013 including Superdrug, Tesco, Morrisons and Asda \u2013 recently cut their price to. Boots\u2019s partial climbdown comes after Labour MPs, the former Conservative minister Anna Soubry and sexual health campaigners heavily criticised its refusal in July to drop the price of the two other versions of EHC it sells. It charges \u00a328.25 for Levonelle and \u00a326.75 for its own generic version. Its new statement announced the arrival of the \u00a315.99 contraceptive but did not say if it was dropping the price of its two existing options. It will continue to offer several EHC products \u201cto ensure we can provide a range of solutions that are right depending on a woman\u2019s individual circumstances and according to the guidance from the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare\u201d, it said. In July, Boots defended its refusal to charge less for EHC by saying that doing so would leave it open to being accused of \u201cincentivising inappropriate use\u201d. Female Labour MPs wrote to the firm accusing it of charging so much for EHC that women could not afford it. \u201cIt is completely unacceptable that British women have been paying up to \u00a330 for a pill that costs a fraction of that to produce,\u201d said the letter, signed by Jess Phillips \u2013 the chair of the women\u2019s parliamentary Labour party \u2013 as well as senior figures including Harriet Harman and Yvette Cooper. \u201cThe high cost of emergency contraception at Boots is preventing women from accessing it when needed.\u201d It also emerged on Thursday that Boots had issued the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), a charity that advises women on their reproductive health, with two legal threats over its campaign for the firm to reduce its prices for the pills. It hired Schillings, the London law firm used by many celebrities, to write to the BPAS accusing it of harassing senior executives by running a campaign that encouraged those opposed to Boots\u2019s behaviour to contact them. The charity said that\u201cpeople writing to Boots senior executives through the BPAS campaign for more affordable contraception included women who needed to use EC [emergency contraception] in a range of circumstances, from being the victim of sexual assault to having missed a pill, as well as pharmacists, GPs and other healthcare professionals who had seen women with unwanted pregnancies s a result of struggling to access EC, and also lifelong customers.\u201d Clare Murphy, BPAS\u2019s director of external affairs, said: \u201cWe are pleased to see that in future Boots will be providing a cheaper emergency contraceptive product across its stores nationally. We are extremely saddened that Boots feels the need to resort to legal warnings against a charity representing the concerns of women in the process.\u201d The charity denied that emails sent to Boots were abusive, tweeting that they were \u201coverwhelmingly polite\u201d. Boots has also renewed its call for the NHS in England to make emergency contraception available to women who need it, as the health service in Scotland and Wales already does.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Saunders surprised many when he voted in June for the Bank of England to increase interest rates. The former Citigroup economist, who joined the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) last year as one of the four external members, warned that the UK economy was performing well enough for inflation to become a challenge. The response, he said, should be a modest rise in the cost of borrowing for businesses and households. Within days he encountered a distinct problem. Official figures showed inflation falling back. Over the summer the annual rise in consumer price inflation (CPI) declined from a peak of 2.9% to 2.6%. Worse was to come. Consumer and business confidence data showed both groups were becoming more nervous about the future. Later, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed GDP growth failed to rebound from its miserable performance in the first quarter. It was stuck in the slow lane, only inching higher from 0.2% in the first three months of 2017 to 0.3% in the second. Surely the gloomy data was a humiliating blow to Saunders\u2019 forecasting prowess. He reckoned inflation was heading upwards to 3% and possibly beyond. The hard facts pointed in the opposite direction. Undaunted, he voted again on 3 August for a 0.25 percentage point rise. A speech on Thursday in Cardiff provided Saunders with the perfect platform for an admission that he had mistimed his interest rate call. But far from it. He maintained his warning, claiming that the fall in inflation was temporary and it was still in danger of becoming entrenched. His explanation centred on three things that would force employers to hike pay rates. First, that unemployment would stay low despite Brexit jitters. Second, that a flight of EU nationals back across the channel would restrict the supply of labour, putting upward pressure on wages. Third, he pointed to studies that showed most workers are unwilling to take on more hours. It is true that some industries are already screaming for skilled staff. The construction industry is certainly under pressure to find people to fill the holes left by departing Polish and Lithuanian workers. As for evidence that the impact is feeding through to the broader economy. There isn\u2019t much more to go on. At the moment the only harm to the economy flows from the EU referendum. In the first instance there was the uncertainty that killed off business investment. A year after the vote, businesses remain reluctant to buy new equipment or expand capacity. Subsequently, the low pound pushed up the cost of imported goods, hitting disposable incomes. Saunders probably feels safe from criticism after his colleague Ian McCafferty joined him in calling for a rise and the Banks\u2019 governor, Mark Carney, almost went as far, hinting that a tougher regime might be necessary before the end of the year. Andy Haldane, Threadneedle Street\u2019s chief economist, was another to say he could envisage a base rate of 0.5% before Christmas. Which leaves us to ponder the forecasting prowess of the MPC as a whole. It beggars belief that while the government maintains its austerity drive and businesses consider the known unknowns thrown up by the Brexit talks, why the central bank would withdraw just about the only support the economy has from an agency of the state. Carney and his team do themselves little credit when they talk about raising rates and winding down quantitative easing while the status quo persists. If they urged the government to push ahead with extra spending on infrastructure and higher pay for nurses and teachers as a way to stimulate the economy, allowing the Bank to withdraw its own, that would make sense. But while the UK resembles a hospital patient on heavy medication, albeit out of intensive care, withdrawing the only stimulant that still works would surely be negligent.",

Middle England\u2019s favourite retailer has signed up an army of plumbers, electricians, decorators and gardeners to offer a new home maintenance service launching next month. The retailer, which has built up one of the most trusted brands in the UK partly thanks to its highly rated customer service and \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d pledge, is now aiming to make employing a tradesperson a lot less hit and miss. The Home Solutions service is part of the department store\u2019s effort to fend off competition from online upstarts such as Amazon by providing more services. New boss Paula Nickolds said the business needed to bring in more beauty salons, home design, personal styling and other services as shoppers\u2019 behaviour changes \u201cprofoundly and fast.\u201d In a bid to add pizzazz to shopping trips the company is also sending store staff to theatre school to teach them entertainment skills and its new Oxford store, which opens in October, will have an experience manager dedicated to organising daily in-store events. The new Home Solutions service has already been tested in Milton Keynes and is being extended to Bristol, Cardiff, Cheltenham, Gloucester and Taunton from 12 September. About 150 tradespeople have been signed up to the scheme so far and the number is expected to increase as the trial expands this year. They will remain independent contractors rather than becoming partners, the term John Lewis uses for its staff who jointly own the company. The independent tradespeople have all been through a \u201crigorous\u201d six-stage recruitment process in partnership with trade associations including interviews, background checks, reviews of their past work and training in customer service. The retailer says it will also carry out spot checks responding to customer feedback. Customers select a job that needs doing and pick a time slot before being matched with available tradespeople via the service\u2019s website, app or call centre. The work is then guaranteed for a year. Tom Athron, group development director at the John Lewis Partnership, said: \u201cAs a trusted retailer of home products our customers often ask us if we can help them with tasks in their homes. We are delighted to be expanding our trial and have taken a lot of care to find professionals who will deliver service to the standard that people expect from John Lewis.\u201d Maureen Hinton, group research director at retail consultancy Global Data, said the new service was a way of responding to the \u201cpeak stuff\u201d trend in which people are tending to buy fewer physical items in favour of services. \u201cJohn Lewis is really exploiting the potential of the brand and current lifestyle trends,\u2019 she said. \u201cThere is a huge amount of trust in John Lewis which is a big advantage but if there is any kind of problem that\u2019s going to reflect badly on the brand. The tradespeople will have to be of a very high standard.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair has stepped up warnings that flights between the UK and Europe are imperilled by Brexit, with the airline\u2019s chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary claiming that the prospect of disrupting aviation was one of the quickest and best ways for the EU27 to \u201cstick it to the British\u201d. O\u2019Leary said that only \u201cpanic and fudge\u201d would now allow flights to continue, and an interim deal would effectively mean Britain \u201crolling over\u201d on its previous red lines on freedom of movement and submitting to European regulation. As airline schedules and flight bookings released almost a year in advance, Ryanair insists it needs legal certainty before autumn 2018 in order to sell flights departing after March 2019, when Brexit takes effect. He also criticised Theresa May on Sky News: \u201cI fail to see what she\u2019s doing in Japan for three days at the moment, why she\u2019s not in Brussels or in Frankfurt or in Paris, which is where these negotiations need to take place. \u201cShe\u2019s just come back from three weeks\u2019 holidays in the Swiss Alps. Now, everybody is entitled to their holidays, but there\u2019s a crisis coming down the road here for the UK economy in the next 12 months. \u201cBrexit is going to be a disaster for the UK economy. She needs to be over there negotiating or at least removing these roadblocks, not swanning around Japan drinking tea and sake.\u201d He said earlier: \u201cIf Britain gets pushed out of the EU, it is absolutely the legal position that flights must stop. You\u2019ve got to negotiate that bilaterally. And yet David Davis and the other geniuses in Brussels can\u2019t negotiate the departure bill, the EU citizen rights ... they haven\u2019t got round to talking about aviation. \u201cIf we don\u2019t know the legal basis for which they\u2019re being operated we\u2019ll be forced to cancel those flights by December 2018 so we can put those flights on sale in Europe.\u201d He said Europe was set against a deal: \u201cWhat the British have underestimated is to the extent that the voices in Europe are lobbying against a deal on flights ... There\u2019s an increasing awareness in the corridors of power in Paris, Brussels and Frankfurt that aviation is the one to stick it to the British government over, because [its effects] come six months before March 2019.\u201d O\u2019Leary claimed: \u201cAll bookings for summer 2019 will carry a government health warning, that this is subject to regulatory approval.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat is increasingly likely to happen is that there will be no flights. Mrs May and the Brexiteers will be trying to explain that to you in 12 months\u2019 time, why getting a car to Scotland or a ferry to Ireland are the only options on offer.\u201d Accused of being hysterical, he conceded he did \u201cnot really believe there will be disruption of flights in April 2019 \u2013 but only because Britain will roll over. It\u2019s the whole myth of Brexit.\u201d While Ryanair has this week joined the industry group Airlines UK, to lobby for more certainty over Brexit, his competitors have not aired concerns in such drastic terms, and easyJet has described O\u2019Leary as scaremongering. O\u2019Leary said other airlines were \u201cin denial\u201d, but added: \u201cYou\u2019ll see not just us but other airlines start to scream at Mrs May.\u201d He claimed easyJet was \u201csecretly shitting themselves\u201d over Brexit. O\u2019Leary produced a document which had been circulated in Brussels showing that carriers including Air France-KLM and Lufthansa were demanding full regulatory convergence in any deal, and stopping all cabotage rights \u2013 meaning UK carriers such as easyJet would not be able to fly domestic routes within Europe. EasyJet recently took out the \u00a310m insurance policy of setting up a new company in Austria, easyJet Europe, to operate its intra-EU flights after 2019, although the head office of easyJet plc remains in Britain. O\u2019Leary predicted: \u201cThat ownership and control structure won\u2019t survive a hard Brexit. Even the Germans can see their way through that one. The charade is going to be hugely ineffective. \u201cThe French and Germans aren\u2019t sitting on the sidelines: they\u2019re going to actively shaft [British Airways owner IAG] and easyJet. This is an historic opportunity for them.\u201d Responding to O\u2019Leary\u2019s claims, an easyJet spokesman said: \u201cAll passengers, all airlines and all governments want there to be flights between the UK and Europe because of the huge value they bring. \u201cEasyJet Europe is just as secure as Ryanair \u2013 it is a Europe-based, European-owned airline.\u201d O\u2019Leary was speaking in London as Ryanair announced six new routes for 2018 as part of its biggest ever flight schedule from the capital, with flights from Stansted to Aalborg, Denmark, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in Germany, Oradea in Romania and Pardubice in the Czech Republic, as well as Luton to Bydgoszcz, Poland. He used the opportunity to reiterate Ryanair\u2019s call for a crackdown on alcohol sales at airports, saying: \u201cWe have to deal with the discomfort to our fellow passengers, diversions of aircraft, and danger when it becomes out of hand.\u201d He said the airline had written to the Civil Aviation Authority proposing reforms including limiting purchases to two alcoholic drinks per boarding card, but had yet to receive a response.",

Now, everybody is entitled to their holidays, but there\u2019s a crisis coming down the road here for the UK economy in the next 12 months. </p> <p>\u201cBrexit is going to be a disaster for the UK economy. She needs to be over there negotiating or at least removing these roadblocks, not swanning around Japan drinking tea and sake.\u201d</p> <p>He said earlier: \u201cIf Britain gets pushed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">out of the EU</a>, it is absolutely the legal position that flights must stop. You\u2019ve got to negotiate that bilaterally. And yet David Davis and the other geniuses in Brussels can\u2019t negotiate the departure bill, the EU citizen rights ... they haven\u2019t got round to talking about aviation. </p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t know the legal basis for which they\u2019re being operated we\u2019ll be forced to cancel those flights by December 2018 so we can put those flights on sale in Europe.\u201d </p> <p>He said Europe was set against a deal: \u201cWhat the British have underestimated is to the extent that the voices in Europe are lobbying against a deal on flights ... There\u2019s an increasing awareness in the corridors of power in Paris, Brussels and Frankfurt that aviation is the one to stick it to the British government over, because [its effects] come six months before March 2019.\u201d </p> <p>O\u2019Leary claimed: \u201cAll bookings for summer 2019 will carry a government health warning, that this is subject to regulatory approval.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cWhat is increasingly likely to happen is that there will be no flights. Mrs May and the Brexiteers will be trying to explain that to you in 12 months\u2019 time, why getting a car to Scotland or a ferry to Ireland are the only options on offer.\u201d </p> <p>Accused of being hysterical, he conceded he did \u201cnot really believe there will be disruption of flights in April 2019 \u2013 but only because Britain will roll over. It\u2019s the whole myth of Brexit.\u201d </p> <p>While Ryanair has this week joined the industry group Airlines UK, to lobby for more certainty over Brexit, his competitors have not aired concerns in such drastic terms, and easyJet has described O\u2019Leary as scaremongering. </p> <p>O\u2019Leary said other airlines were \u201cin denial\u201d, but added: \u201cYou\u2019ll see not just us but other airlines start to scream at Mrs May.\u201d </p> <p>He claimed easyJet was \u201csecretly shitting themselves\u201d over Brexit. O\u2019Leary produced a document which had been circulated in Brussels showing that carriers including Air France-KLM and Lufthansa were demanding full regulatory convergence in any deal, and stopping all cabotage rights \u2013 meaning UK carriers such as easyJet would not be able to fly domestic routes within Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/25/air-passengers-alcohol-crackdown-ryanair-airports\">Air passengers react to alcohol crackdown: 'Get as many in as you can'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>EasyJet recently took out the \u00a310m insurance policy of setting up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/14/easyjet-austria-eu-flights-brexit\">a new company in Austria</a>, easyJet Europe, to operate its intra-EU flights after 2019, although the head office of easyJet plc remains in Britain.

The charade is going to be hugely ineffective.</p> <p>\u201cThe French and Germans aren\u2019t sitting on the sidelines: they\u2019re going to actively shaft [British Airways owner IAG] and easyJet.

      "bodyText": "Asda is being urged to drop a legal action and increase pay on the shop floor after the supermarket lost its appeal against an equal pay claim from 15,000 workers. On Thursday, the employment appeal tribunal backed an October ruling that workers in roles across the shop floor can compare their jobs with those done predominantly by men for a higher wage in Asda\u2019s warehouses. Asda has indicated it would seek permission to take the case to the court of appeal. If the ruling continues to hold, the retailer could be forced to adjust the pay of many of its 100,000-plus shop-floor staff and make back payments going back to 2002, at an estimated cost of up to \u00a3100m. Lawyers representing the mostly female claimants said the they typically earned between \u00a31 and \u00a33 an hour less than staff at Asda\u2019s distribution centres. The supermarket challenged the ruling on 10 different grounds, but was unsuccessful on all. It said no comparison between the two groups of workers was possible partly because different departments ran the stores and the distribution centres and there were different methods for setting pay in each workplace. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, which is backing the equal pay case, said: \u201cGMB look forward to Asda management sitting down and finding a sensible negotiated solution to recognising that our female members in stores should be paid and valued as equal to the men. \u201cInstead of wasting money on litigation, we ask Asda to be a market leader in solving this wide-ranging industry problem.\u201d Chris Benson of Leigh Day, the law firm heading the case for the claimants, said: \u201cAfter yet another defeat, we hope that Asda take this opportunity to reflect on the merits of the claims, and concentrate on why they pay men more than women for jobs of equal value, rather than trying to stop the claims going ahead at all.\u201d An Asda spokesperson said: \u201cWe are disappointed with this appeal ruling which relates to a technical preliminary issue of whether jobs in different parts of the business can be compared. \u201cThe employment appeal tribunal have given us permission to appeal against this judgment, to the court of appeal. We continue to strongly dispute the claims being made against us. \u201cThe employment tribunal has yet to consider whether the jobs are of equal value in terms of their demands and if some jobs are, only then will the tribunal move on to consider the reasons for the differentials, including the existence of different market rates in different industry sectors. \u201cAt Asda, hourly paid colleagues doing the same job in the same location are paid the same. Men and women doing the same job in our retail stores are paid the same. Men and women doing the same job in our distribution centres are paid the same. Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors.\u201d The judgment is expected to have implications for other supermarket equal pay claims, including a case Leigh Day is bringing on behalf of hundreds of Sainsbury\u2019s workers.",

    "webTitle": "Pound dips on uncertainty over Brexit talks - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Markets have been in more upbeat mood this morning, boosted in part by some stronger-than-expected manufacturing data from China this morning. All of Europe\u2019s major markets are in firmly positive territory, and Wall Street has open higher. It is looking less rosy for the pound, which was unable to hold on above $1.29 after Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, raised fresh concerns about how talks are going. The pound is currently down 0.4% against the dollar at $1.2871. Over in France, supermarket group Carrefour issued a profits warning, prompting a heavy share sell-off. Shares are currently down 14%. Eurozone inflation picked up to 1.5% in August from 1.3% in July, while the jobless rate was unchanged at 9.1% (in July). In the UK, the big corporate news was that online gambling firm 888 was handed a record \u00a37.8m fine by the regulator for failing to protect vulnerable customers. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, stepped up his argument for an immediate rise in UK interest rates. On that note we\u2019ll close up for the day. Thank you for all the comments and please join us again tomorrow. AM US markets have maintained the upbeat sentiment in European markets with Wall Street climbing higher in early trading: Dow Jones: +0.3% at 21,958 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,464 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 6,390 Over in the US, initial jobless claims have come in slightly below expectations. There were 236,000 new claims for jobless benefits in the week ending 26 August - 1,000 more than in than in the previous week - according to the US Labor Department figures. It was a little below the 237,000 forecast by economists. Tomorrow is the big day for US jobs data, with the closely watched non-farm payrolls report for August to be published at 13.30 (BST). Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting that 180,000 were added this month, following 209,000 in July. Shilen Shah, bond strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says Barnier\u2019s comments have longer term implications for UK assets: The risk of no transitionary agreement seems to have increased today given the strong word\u2019s from Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator. His not unexpected comments has led to a modest weakening in sterling, however it also increases the chance of the UK exiting the EU in a disorderly fashion. The key hazard for markets is that today\u2019s disagreement is an indicator of where future negotiations are heading, with the danger that the risk-premium on UK assets will widen if the talks implode with no agreement. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee is feeling the effects of the weaker pound today: Here is our full story on the latest round of Brexit talks: The pound\u2019s losses have widened against the dollar and it is now down 0.5% at $1.2856. Sterling has been knocked further since Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said that no \u201cdecisive progress\u201d had been achieved after the third round of talks in Brussels. He told a news conference: Over the course of this week we have made a number of useful clarifications on a number of points, for instance the status of border workers. However, we did not get any decisive progress on any of the principle subjects, even though on the discussion we had about Ireland - that discussion was fruitful. European markets have extended gains this afternoon. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.7% at 7,414 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.6% at 12,074 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 5,092 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1% at 21,717 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.8% at 10,327 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.8% at 374 German data this morning showed that the number of people out of work in Europe\u2019s largest economy fell by 5,000 in August to 2.53m. It disappointed expectations, with economists forecasting a bigger fall of 6,000. Rainer Sartoris, economist at HSBC, said the fall in German unemployment was slowing: The slowdown in the pace of falling unemployment is likely linked to more and more refugees starting to search for a job, as they exit training courses (e.g. language courses). This trend is likely to continue over the coming quarters, which could constrain a further improvement in the number of unemployed. Over in Greece, tourism is helping to boost economic sentiment according to the eurozone\u2019s statistics agency, Eurostat. It comes as the country prepares to further ease capital controls. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Reaping the dividends of a bumper tourism season, Greece saw its economic sentiment indicator rise to 99 points this month from 98.2 points in July. While the index is still in negative territory - optimism is only measured at 100 points - it was the strongest in 12 months and is being interpreted as another turning point for the eurozone\u2019s weakest economy. In another sign of growing confidence in the Greek economy, the leftist-led government is to allow bank depositors to withdraw more of their savings as of tomorrow (September 1st). The move will see the cap on withdrawals being increased by 7% to \u20ac1,800 a month. As part of the relaxation, opening of new accounts will be facilitated for farmers, companies and freelancers. The restrictive measures were imposed at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in the summer of 2015 amid fears of a run on banks. However, it has not been lost on many that total annual withdrawals will actually amount to less. Under the new \u201crelaxed\u201d rules, depositors will be able to withdraw \u20ac21,600 euro a year, compared with \u20ac21,840 under the old rules. French supermarket group Carrefour has suffered a heavy share sell-off this morning after a profit warning from the retailer spooked investors. Shares are currently down nearly 15%, putting the company on track for its biggest daily fall in 20 years. Carrefour reported weaker-than-expected first-half results and warned that full-year profits could fall by 12%. The retailer\u2019s new chief executive, Alexandre Bompard, had this to say: Our 2017 results will be impacted by our first-half performance and an operating environment that will remain difficult in the second half in some countries. The negative news from Carrefour spread throughout the supermarket sector, making UK grocers among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100: Tesco is down 1.3% at 180p Morrisons is down 0.7% at 244p Sainsbury\u2019s is down 0.6% at 234p The retail index has been among the worst performers in Europe this year as competition and structural pressures mount. Paul Harper, equity analyst at DNB Bank, says its partly down to Amazon: It\u2019s been a tough time for the sector, with the more macro theme that Amazon is slowly eating everyone\u2019s lunch, though that\u2019s not the case in Europe to the same extent as the US. Another problem is that the retail sector is relatively highly priced, so there\u2019s not really much room for disappointment. Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist for the eurozone at ING, said higher-than-expected inflation in the region would give ammunition to those members of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council who favour tighter policy. He is not convinced, however: The hawks within the governing council will argue that deflationary pressures have now clearly disappeared. But given the risk that an overshoot of the euro exchange rate could push inflation back below 1.5%, caution remains warranted in removing monetary policy accommodation. We believe that the ECB will announce a \u201cdovish tapering\u201d in October, giving the markets the impression that quantitative easing could be lengthened into the second half of next year, if need be. At the same time we think that a deposit rate hike is not to be expected before the end of 2018. Unemployment in the single currency bloc was unchanged in July at 9.1% - the lowest since February 2009. It compared with a jobless rate of 7.7% in the wider EU. The number of unemployed people in the eurozone rose by 73,000 in July, to 14.86m, according to the Eurostat figures. Here is how it looks across the European Union: Eurozone inflation rose to 1.5% in August, from 1.3% in July, according to a \u201cflash estimate\u201d from Eurostat. It was higher than the 1.4% rate forecast by economists, and the main driver of the rise was energy, with prices up 4% year-on-year. Here is the breakdown: Core inflation - which strips out food and energy - was unchanged at 1.3% in August. Economists predicted a slight dip to 1.2%. The pound has slipped below $1.29, and is currently down 0.2% at $1.2896. Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at Commerzbank, says concerns about the way Brexit talks are going are weighing on the pound: Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on sterling, and if there is a protracted spell of weakness then policymakers may come out to support the currency as it pushes up headline inflation. Against the euro, the pound is down 0.4% at \u20ac1.0832. The top FTSE 100 risers this morning are dominated by mining companies, which tend to benefit from data that signals strong demand from China. All major European markets are up this morning, boosted by stronger-than-expected manufacturing growth in China, positive US data, and easing tension over North Korea. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 7,400 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 12,064 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,072 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 21,581 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.6% at 10,305 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 372 Here is our full story on the speech by Michael Saunders, Bank of England policymaker, in Cardiff: Michael Saunders\u2019 latest call for a rise in rates has failed to lift the pound this morning. Sterling is down 0.2% against the dollar but is still holding on above $1.29 at $1.2902. Saunders\u2019 comments will come as a surprise to few, after his vote for a hike at the last two meetings, but the exchange rate is also reflective of dollar strength. Stronger-than-expected US data on Wednesday has raised investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise rates again before the end of the year, sending the dollar broadly higher. The pound meanwhile is also down -0.2% against the euro this morning, at \u20ac1.0850. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, has stepped up his argument that the UK needs an immediate rise in interest rates. Predicting that inflation would hit 3% in the coming months (well above the Bank\u2019s 2%) target, Saunders told an audience in Cardiff: Our foot no longer needs to be quite so firmly on the accelerator in my view. A modest rise in rates would help ensure a sustainable return of inflation to target over time. He said that raising rates now would allow a more gradual pace of hikes, making it easier for people to adjust to higher borrowing rates. There are considerable advantages to acting early enough to allow a gradual rise in interest rates. It is fully 10 years since the MPC last tightened monetary policy. Many borrowers have never faced a rate hike. It would be preferable to have the space to move gradually, observing the effects as we go. If we get behind the curve, we lose that space. Saunders has voted for a 0.25 point rise in rates \u2013 from a current all-time low of 0.25% - at the last two meetings of the MPC. He has yet to convince the majority of his colleagues, with only one other MPC member - Ian McCafferty - joining him in the vote for a rise. In response to the Gambling Commission\u2019s fine, 888 said: It was never 888\u2019s intention to benefit financially from this technical failure and we have completed a detailed process to identify all affected customers. The group is refunding customers who were able to continue playing when they should have been excluded across 888\u2019s platforms. The Gambling Commission said 888\u2019s record \u00a37.8m fine for failing to protect thousands of vulnerable customers will be divided in the following way: a \u00a33.5m repayment of deposits made by self excluded customers (whose accounts were left accessible) a \u00a362,000 compensation payment to the employer from whom money was stolen by a problem gambler (that 888 failed to spot/stop) a further \u00a34.25m will be paid to a socially responsible cause to invest in measures to tackle gambling-related harm Sarah Harrison, chief executive at the Gambling Commission: Safeguarding consumers is not optional. This penalty package of just under \u00a38m reflects the seriousness of 888\u2019s failings to protect vulnerable customers. The 888 sanction package will ensure those affected don\u2019t lose out, that the operator pays the price for its failings via a sum that will go to tackling gambling-related harm, and that independent assurance will be given to see that lessons are learnt.\u201d 888, one of Britain\u2019s biggest online gambling firms, has been fined a record \u00a37.8m by the regulator for failing to protect thousands of vulnerable customers. An investigation by the Gambling Commission found that over 7,000 customers who had chosen to \u201cself exclude\u201d (people who flag that they wish to stop gambling for at least six months) were still able to access their 888 accounts due to a technical failure. It meant that vulnerable customers were able to deposit \u00a33.5m into their accounts, and then continue to gamble, for over 13 months. 888 also failed to spot \u201cvisible signs\u201d of problem behaviour from one individual, which was so significant it resulted in criminal activity, the watchdog said. That particular customer staked over \u00a31.3m, including \u00a355,000 stolen from their employer. During a 13 month period the customer gambled on average 3-4 hours a day. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Growth in China\u2019s manufacturing sector accelerated unexpectedly in August, reassuring global investors that the world\u2019s second largest economy is still growing at a decent pace. China\u2019s official manufacturing PMI index rose to 51.7 in August from 51.4 in July, confounding economists\u2019 expectations for a small decline. (Anything above 50 signals growth.) Along with stronger Q2 growth and jobs figures from the US on Wednesday, the Chinese PMI figures are expected to lift investor sentiment after a torrid week of heightened tensions over North Korea. Markets on both sides of the Atlantic rose on Wednesday \u2013 largely because of a relatively measured response from President Trump - and European markets are expected to open higher this morning: Also coming up today: 08.25 BST Speech by Michael Saunders, member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee 08.45 BST German unemployment (August) 10.00 BST Eurozone \u2018flash estimate of inflation (August) 13.30 BST US weekly jobless claims",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s plans to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% will are unlikely to create the promised boom in jobs, according to a new report from the non-partisan Institute on Tax and Economic Policy. Trump and Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, have been pushing hard for the plan. The president travels to Missouri on Wednesday to promote the plan and Ryan has taken to the road to venues including Boeing\u2019s headquarters, where Ryan pledged to make the cuts by the end of the year. But the Washington thinktank found that the cuts were unlikely to work . The study looked at 92 publicly-traded corporations that reported consistent profitability between 2008 and 2015, and found that they already benefitted from low effective tax rates, paying less than 20% of that net income to the federal government in tax. Ryan and Trump have argued that a lower tax burden will help create more jobs, but the study argues that these companies are already paying the lower level of taxes and have not created more jobs. In fact, while the total rate of job creation among the US private sector as a whole was 6%, these 92 companies saw a 1% decline in employment. They are creating jobs at a slower rate than the economy, in spite of having precisely this \u201cGoldilocks\u201d tax rate. The Institute on Tax and Economic Policystudied 258 consistently profitable Fortune 500 companies and found that their effective tax rate was 21.2%. In at least one year, 100 paid paid no tax at all. From 2008 until 2015, 30 companies paid an effective rate of 6.9%, and eight paid almost nothing. Those in specific industries (retailing) fared significantly worse than others (utilities), while some companies (McDonald\u2019s) paid vastly more than their rivals. It\u2019s fair to say that the corporate tax code is a mess. The studies suggest that the tax rate is not tied to job creation. While researchers at the Institute for Policy Studies didn\u2019t study the fate of tax savings on a dollar-for-dollar basis, \u201cwe realized that that these companies had huge sums of money that were going into stock buybacks,\u201d says Sarah Anderson, director of the Global Economy Project at the institute and the report\u2019s author. She and her colleagues calculated, based on publicly disclosed data, that the 10 companies that cut the most jobs each spent $45bn over the last nine years to repurchase their stock. That reduces the number of shares outstanding, increasing the earnings per share calculation and thus the value of each individual share. Theoretically, the stock market should recognize this by sending the stock price higher. Clearly, the beneficiaries were shareholders, rather than employees or potential employees. The report\u2019s authors also discovered that companies with lower-than-average tax rates rewarded their CEOs with higher than average paychecks and raises. The average CEO of these 92 firms saw his or her pay rise 18% between 2008 and 2016, while that of those in all companies in the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 Index climbed 13%. (The average employee, meanwhile, got a 4% wage hike between 2008 and 2016.) The better they did at cutting jobs, the higher the CEO\u2019s earning power, the Institute for Policy Studies calculated. The 48 CEOs who eliminated the most jobs earned an average of $14.9m, 14% more than the average CEO. Boeing is the beneficiary of one of the biggest tax breaks ever seen in the country\u2019s history, a deal it struck with the state of Washington after threatening to build its new plant outside the state. Meanwhile, its average federal tax rate over the last 10 years has been only 3.2%, and it paid only 23% \u2013 by its own calculation \u2013 last year. Shortly after the deal with the state \u2013 which failed to insist on employment guarantees \u2013 was brokered, Boeing began to announce massive job cuts, arguing it needs to rely more on automation in order to compete with Airbus. More than 15% of its Washington workforce has been laid off since the big state tax deal was announced in 2013. This article was amended on 31 August 2017. A previous version and headline correctly cited the findings of a report from April; however the new report, from the Institute on Tax and Economic Policy, focused on the tax cut\u2019s likely effects on job creation, not the national debt.",

      "bodyText": "The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has said he believes improved profits \u201cshould flow through to higher wages\u201d, while citing the heavily unionised construction sector as a model. In an interview for ABC\u2019s 7.30 on Thursday night, Morrison returned to the theme of the May budget to claim there were \u201cbetter days ahead\u201d, citing profit and investment figures but acknowledging \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen a flow on to wages yet\u201d. Wages growth in Australia has been stagnant for four years, leading to an increasingly assertive Labor opposition campaign on economic inequality. Asked about poor wages growth, Morrison said other economic data was starting to improve, citing non-mining investment up 2.6% in the June quarter and the fact it was projected to be more than 5% in the next financial year. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see that investment come through, and investment leads to the profits which leads to the wages growth,\u201d he said. Asked if profits always led to wage rises, Morrison said: \u201cI think it should \u2013 that\u2019s the view I hold.\u201d He said profits had gone backward by 0.8% \u201cfor many consecutive quarters\u201d but the most recent two quarters had shown profits lift \u201clargely off the back of commodity prices\u201d. \u201cWe need to see that sustained. And I believe once you see that sustained \u2026 it should flow through to wages.\u201d Asked about Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe\u2019s statement that it \u201cwould be a good thing\u201d if workers now asked for a pay rise, the treasurer claimed what Lowe had \u201cactually said was just a common sense economic observation\u201d that when unemployment went down and profits improve, tightness in the labour market then caused wages to rise. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re starting to see, we\u2019re seeing it in things like the IT security sector, we\u2019re seeing it in some parts of the construction sector, where there\u2019s big construction jobs going on, particularly because of the big public investment going in.\u201d The Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union has recently sought higher wage rises in bargaining to compensate for conditions stripped out of collective agreements by the Turnbull government\u2019s Australian Building and Construction Commission bill, as had been predicted before it passed. Before the election Malcolm Turnbull promised the Coalition would stop excessive pay demands from the CFMEU because the ABCC would prevent industrial coercion. On Wednesday the education minister, Simon Birmingham, encouraged universities to follow the lead of Murdoch University, which successfully terminated its collective agreement, throwing workers back onto the award rate of pay. Labor\u2019s shadow employment minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said this amounted to the Turnbull government \u201cadvocating for the reduction of wages and conditions\u201d. On 7.30 Morrison said the \u201cemerging economic consensus\u201d was that his prediction in May of \u201cbetter days ahead\u201d was correct. Asked whether the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) should pay for a new high-efficiency, low-emissions coal power plant, Morrison said it was a big decision but it was one for the Naif, which is independent of government, to make. On Tuesday Turnbull said the government had \u201cno plans\u201d to fund coal power plants. The treasurer said he and the prime minister were in agreement and funding a plant would be a decision for Naif to make on a commercial basis. Asked if the Clean Energy Target should be set in a way to incentivise so-called \u201cclean coal\u201d power, Morrison said the government was \u201cworking hard\u201d on the proposal for a CET and, however it was set, it should \u201cgive certainty to investors to invest in greater power generation\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Britain needs higher interest rates to prevent inflation from heading back towards 3% and staying there for several years, according to Michael Saunders, one of the two dissenting Bank of England rate-setters to vote for a rise earlier this month. Saunders said the UK economy was able to withstand the impact of higher credit costs after a steep fall in unemployment that paved the way for an increase in wages and higher prices in shops. In a speech to business leaders in Cardiff, Saunders said he recognised that Brexit uncertainties weighed on consumer and business confidence, but warned that the decreasing number of migrant workers, which was already affecting some industries, would add to the pressure to raise wages. \u201cWe do not need to be putting the brakes on so much that the economy weakens sharply,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our foot no longer needs to be quite so firmly on the accelerator in my view. A modest rise in rates would help ensure a sustainable return of inflation to target over time.\u201d Saunders is one of eight members of the monetary policy committee, having joined last year from the investment bank Citigroup. Earlier this month, the MPC said Brexit uncertainties had discouraged some companies from awarding pay rises as it warned that rising prices and weak wage growth would continue to squeeze living standards this year. The committee voted 6-2 to leave official borrowing costs at their all-time low of 0.25%, but it hinted that rates would have to rise over the coming year to keep inflation in check. Since the vote, inflation has fallen from a recent peak of 2.9% to 2.6%, and a string of business and consumer confidence surveys have shown households and business leaders expecting a more gloomy outlook for the economy. Saunders said: \u201cThere are considerable advantages to acting early enough to allow a gradual rise in interest rates. It is fully 10 years since the MPC last tightened monetary policy. \u201cOverall, balance sheets are much less fragile than 10 years ago, with lower debt to income ratios and higher levels of liquidity among companies and households. Banks have much stronger capital positions. \u201cA sizeable net balance of consumers, especially those with a mortgage, already expect interest rates to rise in the year ahead and hence have presumably incorporated this in spending decisions. So I do not expect a modest rise in rates will have a disproportionate effect on spending. \u201cNevertheless, many borrowers have never faced a rate hike. It would be preferable to have the space to move gradually, observing the effects as we go. If we get behind the curve, we lose that space.\u201d",

A modest rise in rates would help ensure a sustainable return of inflation to target over time.\u201d</p> <p>Saunders is one of eight members of the monetary policy committee, having joined last year from the investment bank Citigroup.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the MPC said Brexit uncertainties had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/03/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-despite-inflation-fears\">discouraged some companies</a> from awarding pay rises as it warned that rising prices and weak wage growth would continue to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/02/ifs-growth-uk-living-standards-worst-in-60-years-pensions-poverty-budget\">squeeze living standards</a> this year.</p> <p>The committee voted 6-2 to leave official borrowing costs at their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">all-time low of 0.25%</a>, but it hinted that rates would have to rise over the coming year to keep inflation in check.</p> <p>Since the vote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/18/uk-inflation-falls-first-time-9-months-fuel-prices\">inflation has fallen</a> from a recent peak of 2.9% to 2.6%, and a string of business and consumer confidence surveys have shown households and business leaders expecting a more gloomy outlook for the economy.</p> <p>Saunders said: \u201cThere are considerable advantages to acting early enough to allow a gradual rise in interest rates. It is fully 10 years since the MPC last tightened monetary policy. </p> <p>\u201cOverall, balance sheets are much less fragile than 10 years ago, with lower debt to income ratios and higher levels of liquidity among companies and households. Banks have much stronger capital positions.</p> <p>\u201cA sizeable net balance of consumers, especially those with a mortgage, already expect interest rates to rise in the year ahead and hence have presumably incorporated this in spending decisions. So I do not expect a modest rise in rates will have a disproportionate effect on spending. </p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, many borrowers have never faced a rate hike. It would be preferable to have the space to move gradually, observing the effects as we go. If we get behind the curve, we lose that space.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is too early to tell whether the slowdown in UK consumer credit growth in July was the result of waning confidence among the nation\u2019s shoppers or the restraints placed on banks by the regulator. Either way it spells trouble for an economy dependent on consumer spending to drive GDP growth. With business investment in the doldrums and exports unable to make much headway despite the low pound, the consumer is the linchpin preventing the economy stalling altogether. Admittedly consumers\u2019 appetite for credit is still high and the annual growth rate only slowed to 9.8% from 10% in June. Yet it is increasingly clear that the post-2014 boom in jobs and growth was tied to a period of 10%-plus consumer credit growth and that era now appears to be over. Adding to the gloom, a fall in consumer confidence predicted by the European commission\u2019s monthly index for August confirmed the trend. Of several measures used to compile the data, the test of confidence in the state of the UK economy over the next 12 months was the worst. It slid to a four-year low, the commission said. Brexit uncertainty is likely to play a big part in this. And while the reaction cannot be described as a panic, households are visibly pulling in their horns. No wonder Lloyds bank\u2019s business survey for August showed that overall business confidence fell 13 points to a one-year low of 17%. It\u2019s clear that business leaders can also see a difficult year ahead. Uncertain future for world\u2019s wealthiest people? There are different ways of looking at the world\u2019s richest people and how they have fared since the 2008 crash. A glance at the Forbes rich list reveals that the usual suspects are amassing even greater piles of wealth than when Lehman Brothers hit the buffers. Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates leads the pack again with a fortune of $86bn (\u00a366bn) followed by investment guru Warren Buffett, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos and Zara owner Amancio Ortega. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Mexican telecoms magnate Carlos Slim and Larry Ellison, who founded the Oracle database business, rank five, six and seven, the Koch brothers are eighth and ninth with $48.3bn each, and financial information provider Michael Bloomberg manages a respectable 10th place with $47.5bn. From one angle they are obscenely rich, but from another viewpoint they at least created, or invested in, businesses that employ millions of people. China\u2019s second-richest person is a property magnate who has seen his wealth increase by $9bn in just the past seven days. Hui Ka Yan has become Asia\u2019s second richest person (after Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, the Chinese version of Amazon) on the back of a boom in prices. No effort required. So far China\u2019s property boom has added $43.8bn to the fortunes of the country\u2019s property tycoons this year, a collective gain of 85%, according to Bloomberg. No wonder economists fear that without a clampdown on credit, a crash awaits. Time for regulator to visit Asos as it closes in on M&amp;S\u2019s retail crown For anyone who still spends time shopping on the high street for clothes, Marks &amp; Spencer remains a strong reference point. News that online, fast fashion operator Asos is poised to have a higher stock market value than M&amp;S is seen by some in the City as a \u201cseminal moment\u201d that illustrates the passing of the old in favour of younger, more nimble rivals. Certainly, given M&amp;S\u2019s problems with its fashions and persistent failure to restock popular lines and sizes, the retailer is an example of how difficult many 20th century businesses have found the transition to servicing niche tech-savvy audiences with fickle tastes. But for much of Asos\u2019s existence, the difference has been more stark in the relative employment practices. Where M&amp;S paid a decent wage and offered one of the most generous non-final salary pension schemes, according to the Community union many Asos warehouse workers were employed by the agency Transline on \u201cunacceptable\u201d pay rates and with few benefits. M&amp;S staff were permanent and could to some extent negotiate their rotas. The Community union, which has recently begun to represent Asos staff, claimed they could be sent home without pay if they weren\u2019t needed. Asos claims it was entirely misrepresented by the former chair of the business select committee, Iain Wright, when he called for a halt to such practices. However, Asos subsequently terminated the contract with Transline, increased the number of permanent contracts and raised workers\u2019 wages by about 10%. The Community union reckons Asos is on the right path. To verify that, the new business committee chair, Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves, should prioritise a visit and see for herself.",
