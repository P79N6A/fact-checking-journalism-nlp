      "bodyText": "Administrators to BHS are to close 20 stores next Saturday as hopes of finding a buyer for the failed department store fade. Stores including Slough, Stirling, Truro, Preston, Stratford-upon-Avon and Yeovil \u2013 all leased properties \u2013 will shut on 23 July. Stock levels have been running low at the stores since BHS collapsed into administration in April. Up to 580 staff will be affected by the closures, most of whom are likely to be made redundant, but it is understood that administrators are hoping to redeploy some employees. The shops are being closed as MPs prepare to write a report on the demise of the retailer, which is likely to criticise heavily its former owners Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell. Green has set out a robust defence of his stewardship of BHS in a letter to MPs, claiming that he invested \u00a3421m into the group during his 15 years at the helm. It is clear that we invested substantially in the business,\u201d he said. The amount of capital investment highlighted by Green during his tenure almost exactly matches the \u00a3423m paid in dividends to his family and other BHS shareholders between 2000 and 2004. It is part of the more than \u00a3580m, including rental payments and interest, extracted from the company throughout Green\u2019s time in charge. The collapse of BHS has put 11,000 jobs at risk and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015 to a consortium led by Chappell, a serial bankrupt. The retailer failed 13 months later. Al Mana Group, based in Doha, bought BHS\u2019s 70 overseas stores and its online business in June, but it is thought that administrator Duff &amp; Phelps will now be forced to sell off the group\u2019s 164 UK outlets piecemeal. MPs are hoping to publish their report on BHS within weeks. The Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, one of the two parliamentary groups investigating BHS, has said Green\u2019s credibility rests on coming up with a generous settlement for pensioners, following a bad-tempered evidence session with the retail tycoon last month. Green previously admitted mistakes in the handling of the pension fund, but has pledged to \u201csort it\u201d. When giving evidence to MPs, Green said he had not been sufficiently involved in the fund\u2019s dealings, but letters from the former chair of the BHS pension fund trustees indicate that Green was involved in meetings as early as 2002. In his letter to MPs, Green said: \u201cIt is clear that we invested substantially in the business, we lent substantial sums to the business and we gave Retail Acquisitions [Chappell\u2019s consortium] every chance with a solid platform to take the business forward.\u201d Letters from Green\u2019s legal advisers, Linklaters, claim that Chappell broke the terms of a sale agreement by failing to invest his own money in BHS, and paying out proceeds from property sales to fund loans, and payments to himself and advisers. Retail Acquisitions borrowed \u00a35m, secured against BHS\u2019s warehouse in Atherstone, Warwickshire, to provide half of a promised equity investment agreed as part of his deal with Green. Linklaters wrote to law firm Olswang in June, saying that raising the money against BHS\u2019s Atherstone warehouse was \u201ccontrary to the clear commercial understanding\u201d that a \u00a35m upfront investment should be new equity. Sources close to Green say he is \u201cdeeply angry\u201d at Olswang and its role in the scandal. Evidence from Eddie Parladorio, one of Chappell\u2019s key lieutenants, indicated that Chappell was still trying to raise a personal loan to fund his promised investment in the retailer 48 hours before he agreed a takeover deal. Parladorio said a loan was agreed with Retail Acquisitions, rather than Chappell personally, at the very last moment. He also told MPs that he had voted against a plan for Retail Acquisitions to lend \u00a31.5m to the company that owns Chappell\u2019s father\u2019s house, as \u201cI did not consider this loan to be the business of RAL\u201d. Chappell declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "The budget tour operator Lowcostholidays has gone bust, warning customers already on holiday that they could be asked to pay their hotel bills again and potentially ruining the summer plans of tens of thousands of Britons yet to travel. Smith &amp; Williamson, which has been appointed as administrator, said in a statement that there were approximately 27,000 customers currently at resorts and 110,000 who had booked trips but were yet to set off. About 55% of the group\u2019s customers are British. In 2013, the Civil Aviation Authority had warned holidaymakers to avoid booking with Lowcostholidays after the company relocated to Spain, which meant that its holidays were no longer protected under the Atol scheme run by the CAA. This ensures that customers can return home and get their money back if a company goes bust. Lowcostholidays had dismissed these warnings, stating that holidaymakers had protection under a Spanish scheme. A message on the company\u2019s website on Friday night said: \u201cWe deeply regret to announce that the lowcosttravelgroup ceased to trade on 15 July 2016, following exhaustive attempts by the group\u2019s directors to rescue the group, which has been hampered by the recent and ongoing turbulent financial environment.\u201d The operator told holidaymakers via its website that their flights home would be still be valid, but warned that hotel owners, as well as companies offering services such as airport transfers, may ask them to settle their bills before leaving. On its website, the company advises customers to claim for any extra payments that they are asked to make to their travel insurer, credit card company or the government of the Balearic Islands, which licensed Lowcostholidays. Smith &amp; Williamson said the company\u2019s failure \u201cwould affect many customers who have purchased flights or holidays, some of whom are on holiday in resorts and some of whom have not travelled as yet. All flights as regards those currently in resorts have been paid for and hence customers will be able to fly home when their holidays are over.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, as regards customers who have not travelled, a small number will have problems as regards their flights not having been paid for, and many will have problems as regards their hotel rooms not having been paid for,\u201d the administrator added. Lowcosttravelgroup was founded in 2004 by Paul Evans, a travel industry executive who started out as a resort manager for Club 18-30. The company has offices in the UK, Spain, Switzerland and Poland, but has already made redundant the majority of its 451 staff, including the 120 based at Gatwick. Until recently, the Lowcostholidays website had promised holidaymakers: \u201cYou can have confidence when travelling with lowcostholidays. We have been successfully trading for 10 years and we have full financial protection arrangements as required by European law. We are established in Spain. Spain, just as the UK does, has financial protection requirements for travel companies. We comply fully with those financial protection requirements.\u201d The last filed accounts for Lowcosttravelgroup show that the business had sold holidays worth \u00a3477m in the year to October 2014, making a pretax loss of \u00a347,000. The company\u2019s auditors resigned in March, following the departure of two directors in December. Finbarr O\u2019Connell of Smith &amp; Williamson said a number of factors had contributed to the group\u2019s demise, including the EU referendum, which led some customers to delay holiday decisions. \u201cThe group experienced significant market headwinds in the run-up to the EU referendum as holidaymakers delayed decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was compounded by the leave vote itself and the subsequent fall in value of the pound. \u201cWe are planning to meet with the appropriate Spanish regulators and authorities to investigate what compensation may be available to customers who have lost money due to this collapse.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dieting supplement sales company Herbalife dodged the \u201cpyramid scheme\u201d designation on Friday as it agreed to pay the US Federal Trade Commission a $200m fine. The FTC said Herbalife cheated hopeful salespeople out of hundreds of millions of dollars with a high-pressure multi-level marketing scheme. Herbalife\u2019s stock received an immediate 15% increase following the news. The company also announced that it would hire a second former FTC commissioner in a press release describing the terms of the settlement. The FTC required the company to restructure its operations so that it tracked and rewarded sales that ended in purchases by consumers, rather than that it allegedly hoodwinked junior retailers. The regulator\u2019s chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, said the FTC had stopped short of branding Herbalife\u2019s tactics a \u201cpyramid scheme\u201d or shutting its operations down, opting for the less severe \u201cunfairness\u201d charge. \u201cWe focused less on the label,\u201d Ramirez said. Herbalife issued a press release saying it would allow activist investor Carl Icahn to purchase an increased maximum 34.99% of the company\u2019s stock \u2013 Icahn already owns about 18% of the company\u2019s stock. The company is required by the FTC to pay for an independent compliance coordinator; that coordinator will be a board headed by former FTC chairman Jon Liebowitz. The company already boasts one FTC commissioner, Pamela Jones Harbour, in its executive suite; Harbour will specifically oversee the changes to the way the company rewards its distributors. \u201cI have the greatest confidence in Herbalife\u2019s CEO, Michael Johnson,\u201d Icahn said in a press release.\u201d Johnson, who ran the company throughout the scandal was at one time the highest-paid CEO in the US, though he did lose his bonus in 2014. \u201cThe company promised people a dream: a chance to quit their jobs, change their lives and gain financial freedom,\u201d said Ramirez. Instead, the LA-based company paid out almost exclusively to employees who pressured other people to buy into the program at a cost of about $2,000 apiece. Herbalife enjoyed revenues from members in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, notably Ghana and Zambia. A career selling Herbalife\u2019s products to consumers was effectively worthless, Ramirez told reporters on Friday; the only way to make money was for salespeople to buy its products in bulk, pressure new recruits into joining the company and then sell those products to the new employees. \u201cThe average amount that more than half of the elite members known as \u2018sales leaders\u2019 received in a year for recruiting others into the Herbalife program was less than $300,\u201d Ramirez said. Far more made nothing or lost money on the initial investment. Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management said in 2012 that he would short the company\u2019s stock and that his firm\u2019s \u201ctarget price is zero because we think the business will fail\u201d and pledged to donate all proceeds from Pershing Square\u2019s short position on the company\u2019s stock to charity. The company\u2019s stock price has risen in the subsequent years.",

The FTC said <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/12/herbalife-facing-ftc-inquiry\">Herbalife cheated hopeful salespeople</a> out of hundreds of millions of dollars with a high-pressure multi-level marketing scheme.</p> <p>Herbalife\u2019s stock received an immediate 15% increase following the news. The company also announced that it would hire a second former FTC commissioner in a press release describing the terms of the settlement.</p> <p>The FTC required the company to restructure its operations so that it tracked and rewarded sales that ended in purchases by consumers, rather than that it allegedly hoodwinked junior retailers. </p> <p>The regulator\u2019s chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, said the FTC had stopped short of branding Herbalife\u2019s tactics a \u201cpyramid scheme\u201d or shutting its operations down, opting for the less severe \u201cunfairness\u201d charge. </p> <p>\u201cWe focused less on the label,\u201d Ramirez said. Herbalife issued a press release saying it would allow activist investor Carl Icahn to purchase an increased maximum 34.99% of the company\u2019s stock \u2013 Icahn already owns about 18% of the company\u2019s stock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/21/herbalife-ceo-ponzi-scheme\">Herbalife CEO accused of running 'Ponzi scheme'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company is required by the FTC to pay for an independent compliance coordinator; that coordinator will be a board headed by former FTC chairman Jon Liebowitz.

Instead, the LA-based company paid out almost exclusively to employees who pressured other people to buy into the program at a cost of about $2,000 apiece. Herbalife enjoyed revenues from members in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, notably Ghana and Zambia.</p> <p>A career selling Herbalife\u2019s products to consumers was effectively worthless, Ramirez told reporters on Friday; the only way to make money was for salespeople to buy its products in bulk, pressure new recruits into joining the company and then sell those products to the new employees. </p> <p>\u201cThe average amount that more than half of the elite members known as \u2018sales leaders\u2019 received in a year for recruiting others into the Herbalife program was less than $300,\u201d Ramirez said.

      "bodyText": "The pound is now down against the dollar, weakened in part by the comments from Andy Haldane earlier. Sterling is down 0.4% at $1.3291, and down 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1983. And that\u2019s it for today. Thank you for joining us and have a great weekend. AM US markets have opened slightly higher following the stronger-than-expected figures from the retail and manufacturing sectors in June. Dow Jones: +0.2% at 18,536 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,168 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,043 The US manufacturing sector was also in better-than-expected health in June. Output increased 0.4% over the month, compared with expectations of a 0.2% rise and a 0.3% drop in May. The wider measure of industrial output rose by 0.6%, following a 0.3% drop in May. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says the unexpected strength of retail sales signals annual growth of between 2.5%-3% in the second quarter. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, says the data suggests the Federal Reserve might raise US interest rates before markets are currently expecting. Markets have virtually no tightening by the Fed priced in until late 2017, but following on from the strong recent labour market report, the latest US data indicate that there is nothing much wrong with either US growth, and few reasons for concern about inflation either. Markets seem in a wait-and-see mode following the UK Brexit vote, and the Fed seems in no hurry to disappoint them by doing anything radical. So we don\u2019t see this data having much effect on markets expectations. But the evidence is mounting that the pessimism on the US economy and the Fed in particular is overdone, and a market rethink cannot be too far away. US retail sales for June have come in stronger-than-expected, rising 0.6% over the month compared with expectations of a much smaller 0.1% increase. It was an improvement on May, when sales were up by just 0.2% (revised down from an earlier estimate of 0.5% growth). Separate US data showed annual inflation was unchanged at 1% in June, roughly in line with expectations of 1.1%. Core inflation - which strips out more volatile elements such as energy and food - ticked up to 2.3% in June from 2.2% in May. The rail minister Claire Perry has resigned, after previously admitting she was \u201coften ashamed\u201d to be in the job while Southern continues to cause misery for commuters. Our story here: European new car sales grew 6.9% in June compared with the same month a year earlier, with 1.46m vehicles registered. It was the 34th consecutive month of growth. Among the major markets, Italy was the strongest performer, with new car sales up 11.9%, while the UK was at the bottom of the pile with sales down 0.8% (as private sales fell before the referendum). Italy: +11.9% Spain: +11.2% Germany: +8.3% France: 0.8% UK: -0.8% Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has this take on equity markets, which are down across Europe: Europe\u2019s earlier positions only became more entrenched as Friday went on, while the US open looks unlikely to bring much excitement. Dropping around 20 points the FTSE dipped below 6650, sporadically grazing lows not see since the start of the week. The continued losses in the travel sector, alongside the wave of red currently coating the commodities, were the catalysts for the UK index\u2019s Friday fall, though the residual disappointment that the Bank of England failed to reveal any stimulus measures yesterday obviously also played a part. The eurozone understandably saw the biggest losses this morning, the DAX and CAC falling 0.5% and 0.8% respectively following the tragic events in Nice on Thursday evening. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC\u2019s general secretary, says the drop in UK construction output in May shows there is an urgent need for Theresa May\u2019s government to deliver on its industrial strategy pledge. Even before the referendum vote, construction was in trouble. We need to ensure that working people do not pay the price for leaving the EU. Greg Clark needs to live up to his new title as Industrial Strategy Secretary and develop an industrial road map for the UK. A major programme of public investment can support jobs and growth, and provide a much-needed confidence boost. That means ministers greenlighting Heathrow\u2019s third runway, expanding high-speed rail, and building more homes. European markets are still down, with investors finding little to cheer. The FTSE 250 is down 1.2% at 16,591 Here is our full story on Andrew Haldane\u2019s insistence that the Bank of England must pump fresh stimulus into the UK economy from August. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, described this morning\u2019s weak UK construction data as the latest in \u201can ugly run of data for the sector\u201d. He says the pace of UK economic growth probably slowed in the second quarter - from 0.4% in the first - with the construction acting as a drag. Construction looks likely to have contracted in the second quarter, adding weight to expectations that the overall pace of economic growth will have slowed in the second quarter from the 0.4% expansion seen in the first quarter. PMI data point to just a 0.2% rise in second quarter GDP. Going forward, prospects look worse, for the short term at least. The drop in activity seen in the June construction PMI was fueled by uncertainty about the mere possibility off \u2018Brexit\u2019. The reality of the UK leaving the EU and the associated heightened uncertainty, especially in relation to commercial property and housing investment, is therefore likely to cause further stress in coming months. The Bank of England needs to unleash fresh measures at its August policy meeting to deal with the fallout from the Brexit vote. That is the view of Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist and member of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. The MPC surprised the City yesterday by failing to cut interest rates. Economists were forecasting a quarter point cut to 0.25%. But in comments made on Friday Haldane is loud and clear that the Bank is poised to act in August, an inflation report month when policymakers will have access to the latest forecasts. And the MPC might do more than cut rates. Haldane says: In my personal view... a material easing of monetary policy is likely to be needed, as one part of a collective policy response aimed at helping protect the economy and jobs from a downturn. Given the scale of insurance required, a package of mutually complementary monetary policy easing measures is likely to be necessary. And this monetary response, if it is to buttress expectations and confidence, needs I think to be delivered promptly as well as muscularly. By promptly I mean next month, when the precise size and extent of the necessary stimulatory measures can be determined as part of the August Inflation Report round. It is fairly unusually for a member of the MPC to be so direct, and Haldane\u2019s comments immediately reduced the pound\u2019s gains against the dolllar. It is now up just 0.1% at $1.3352. Haldane uses an interesting analogy to stress the importance of taking strong action, quickly: I would rather run the risk of taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut than taking a miniature rock hammer to tunnel my way out of prison \u2013 like another Andy, the one in the Shawshank Redemption. And yes I know Andy did eventually escape. But it did take him 20 years. The MPC does not have that same \u201cluxury\u201d. The poor construction data for May suggests the sector was a drag on the wider economy in the second quarter of the year. Construction output would have had to have risen 1.9% in June just to be flat over the quarter. That seems unlikely, especially given the Markit PMI indicator suggests June was a very weak month for the sector. The ONS will publish its first estimate of second-quarter growth on 27 July. Reaction to the weak construction data is coming in. Output fell 2.1% in May compared with June, and was 1.9% lower than a year earlier according to the Office for National Statistics data. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said it was \u201cmore very disappointing news on the construction sector\u201d. Housebuilding was the main drag over the month. The construction sector does look to be vulnerable following the Brexit vote. The vote to leave the EU threatens to weigh down markedly on construction activity in the near term at least due to heightened caution of clients to commit to major projects particularly in the commercial real estate sector, likely markedly weakened economic activity and the very real risk of a significant downturn in the housing market. Earlier this week, the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilder Barratt said it could reduce the rate at which it builds new homes because of the economic slowdown the Brexit vote is expected to trigger. The sharper-than-expected fall in construction in May came a month before Britain voted in the EU referendum on 23 June. The biggest driver of the monthly fall was a slowdown in private housebuilding, signalling caution among companies in the run-up to the vote. The only part of the construction sector that didn\u2019t shrink in May was infrastructure. Construction output fell 2.1% in May, following a 2.8% increase in April (revised up from 2.5%). It was worse than expected, with economists forecasting a smaller drop of 1%. Sterling is set for its biggest weekly gain since 2009, during the depths of the financial crisis. The pound is up 0.6% against the dollar at $1.3414, after hitting a low point on Monday of $1.2849. Here is our story on how Canada is educating Britain on how to do trade deals... The UK government has approached Canada for advice on how to do trade deals following Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Liam Fox, secretary of state for the newly created department for international trade, will meet Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s trade minister on Friday afternoon. She will be able to give Fox a key insight into the technicalities of how Canada negotiated its recent trade agreement with the EU. Freeland told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that securing such trade deals is \u201cvery very complicated\u201d, and that\u2019s with a 300-strong negotiating team. Britain, on the other hand, does not have a negotiating team. It hasn\u2019t needed one as a member of the EU because trade agreements are struck by Brussels on behalf of its member states. That could prove to be a major stumbling block, as the UK government will need to bring in a large team to negotiate new deals for Britain post-Brexit. Where will they all come from? The government will hope that it can \u2018borrow\u2019 negotiators from places such as Canada and New Zealand, but it is also thought to be sounding out top law firms and consultancies which could prove costly for the UK taxpayer. The pound is now back below $1.34, but is still up 0.3% at $1.3373. It is just a touch up against the euro at\u20ac1.2006. Markets are down across Europe this morning. Travel and leisure companies are among the biggest fallers following the Bastille Day attack in Nice, France. FTSE 100: -0.1% at 6,649 FTSE 250: -0.2% at 16,760 STOXX Europe 600: -0.5% at 337 France\u2019s CAC: -0.7% at 4,353 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 10,021 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 16,789 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 8,536 Asian markets have risen, helped by data from China which suggested the world\u2019s second largest economy is stable. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound continues to rise this morning and is now above $1.34, after receiving a boost on Thursday when the Bank of England surprised the City by leaving interest rates on hold at 0.5%. Economists polled by Reuters were forecasting a quarter point rate following earlier signals from governor Mark Carney that the Bank was ready to pump more stimulus into the economy in a bid to ward off recession in this post Brexit-vote world. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee is now expected to lower rates at its meeting in August - an inflation report month when policymakers have access to Threadneedle Street\u2019s latest economic forecasts. The pound is up 0.7% against the dollar at $1.3434, and up 0.6% against the euro at \u20ac1.2068. Also coming up today... UK construction output numbers for May, which should give an indication of confidence in the run-up to the referendum. Eurozone inflation data for June. The Bank of England is expected to publish a speech by Andy Haldane, its chief economist and member of the Monetary Policy Committee. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor is giving a speech in Toronto about climate change. From the US, we will bring you the latest data from the retail and manufacturing sectors, as well inflation data for June.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has set out a robust defence of his stewardship of BHS, claiming that he put \u00a3421m into the group during his 15 years at the helm. In a letter to MPs investigating the demise of the retailer, which is being wound down after falling into administration with a \u00a3571m pension fund deficit, Green said \u201cit is clear that we invested substantially in the business\u201d. The amount of capital investment highlighted by Green during his tenure almost exactly matches the \u00a3423m paid in dividends to his family and other BHS shareholders between 2000 and 2004. It is part of the more than \u00a3580m, including rental payments and interest, extracted from the company under his control. MPs are expected to heavily criticise the actions of Green, who sold BHS for \u00a31 to the serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell in March 2015, in a report scheduled to be published in the next two weeks. The Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, one of the two parliamentary groups investigating BHS, has said Green\u2019s credibility rests on coming up with a generous settlement for pensioners, following a bad-tempered evidence session with the retail tycoon last month. Green has been accused of offloading BHS to the inexperienced and underfunded Chappell as a way to avoid dealing with the company\u2019s pension problems. He previously admitted mistakes in the handling of the pension fund, but has pledged to \u201csort it\u201d. When giving evidence to MPs, Green said he had not been sufficiently involved in the fund\u2019s dealings, but letters from the former chair of the BHS pension fund trustees indicate that Green was involved in meetings as early as 2002. Chappell told MPs that he began talks about taking over BHS after working on an earlier bid led by Paul Sutton, a convicted fraudster, which was thrown out by Green. In the letter, Green repeated his assertion that he was not aware that Chappell was part of Sutton\u2019s team. \u201cIt is clear that we invested substantially in the business, we lent substantial sums to the business and we gave Retail Acquisitions [Chappell\u2019s consortium] every chance with a solid platform to take the business forward,\u201d he said. Letters from Green\u2019s legal advisers, Linklaters, claim Chappell broke the terms of a sale agreement by failing to invest his own money in BHS, and paying out proceeds from property sales to fund loans, and payments to himself and advisers. Retail Acquisitions group borrowed \u00a35m, secured against BHS\u2019s warehouse in Atherstone, Warwickshire, to provide half a promised equity investment agreed as part of his deal with Green. Linklaters wrote to law firm Olswang in June, saying that raising the money against BHS\u2019s Atherstone warehouse was \u201ccontrary to the clear commercial understanding\u201d that a \u00a35m upfront investment should be new equity. Evidence from Eddie Parladorio, one of Chappell\u2019s key lieutenants, indicated that Chappell was still trying to raise a personal loan to fund his promised investment in the retailer 48 hours before he agreed a takeover deal. Parladorio said a loan was agreed with Retail Acquisitions, rather than Chappell personally, at the very last moment. He also told MPs that he had voted against a plan for Retail Acquisitions to lend \u00a31.5m to the company that owns Chappell\u2019s father\u2019s house, as \u201cI did not consider this loan to be the business of RAL\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has called for a big package of measures to support the UK\u2019s post-Brexit economy, stressing the need for a prompt and robust response to the uncertainty. Andy Haldane made it clear the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee would do more than merely cut interest rates from their already record low of 0.5% when it meets in August. The Bank\u2019s chief economist used a speech to warn that decisive action was required at a time when confidence had been dented by the shock referendum result. \u201cIn my personal view, this means a material easing of monetary policy is likely to be needed, as one part of a collective policy response aimed at helping protect the economy and jobs from a downturn. \u201cGiven the scale of insurance required, a package of mutually complementary monetary policy easing measures is likely to be necessary. And this monetary response, if it is to buttress expectations and confidence, needs I think to be delivered promptly as well as muscularly. By promptly I mean next month, when the precise size and extent of the necessary stimulatory measures can be determined as part of the August inflation report round.\u201d The Bank surprised the City when it left interest rates on hold at its July meeting held this week, but the minutes of the MPC\u2019s discussions said most of its nine members thought an easing of policy would be required in August. The tone and content of Haldane\u2019s speech suggest that the MPC will use public appearances to make the case for strong action in August. Options include cutting interest rates to 0.25% or lower, restarting the Bank\u2019s \u00a3375bn quantitative easing scheme and providing cut price loans to banks under the funding for lending scheme. Signs that the Bank is planning a major stimulus package next month put a halt to the upward move in the pound, which had rallied after Threadneedle Street left rates on hold. Sterling lost a cent against the dollar to stand at $1.3245. In a reference to the prison movie The Shawshank Redemption Haldane said: \u201cI would rather run the risk of taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut than taking a miniature rock hammer to tunnel my way out of prison \u2013 like another Andy, the one in the Shawshank Redemption. And yes I know Andy did eventually escape. But it did take him 20 years. The MPC does not have that same \u2018luxury\u2019.\u201d Haldane originally made his speech in Port Talbot a week after the 23 June referendum. It has only just been released in an amended form to include references to the Bank\u2019s July interest-rate decision and to recent economic developments. The Bank\u2019s economist said there had been signs of the economy struggling even before the Brexit vote, but added: \u201cOver the past month, the outcome of the EU referendum has added another important ingredient to this mix. It has increased materially the degree of uncertainty \u2013 economic, policy, and political \u2013 around the UK\u2019s economic recovery.\u201d Haldane said the economy was unlikely to crash but was likely to slow, perhaps markedly in the quarters ahead. \u201cWhile companies and consumers might not be slamming on the brakes and going into reverse, as in 2008, some are likely to be going down a few gears, perhaps even moving into neutral. \u201cExternal economists expect the UK economy to tread water over the next few quarters. That means the amount of slack in the UK economy is likely to begin steadily rising in the period ahead, perhaps causing unemployment to rise.\u201d Haldane\u2019s remarks came as official figures showed that the construction industry - which accounts for around 6% of national output - was struggling before the Brexit vote. The sharpest fall in housebuilding since 2014 meant that construction output in May was 2.1% down on April and 2% lower than in May 2015. Housing output has now fallen in every month this year apart from February, and things could slow further after the 23 June Brexit vote. The latest figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, published earlier this week, found that buyer interest and expectations of future sales withered in the post-referendum period.",

And this monetary response, if it is to buttress expectations and confidence, needs I think to be delivered promptly as well as muscularly. By promptly I mean next month, when the precise size and extent of the necessary stimulatory measures can be determined as part of the August inflation report round.\u201d<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/bank-of-england-leaves-uk-interest-rates-on-hold-at-05\">The Bank surprised the City when it left interest rates on hold at its July meeting </a>held this week, but the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2016/007.aspx\">minutes of the MPC\u2019s discussions </a>said most of its nine members thought an easing of policy would be required in August.</p> <p>The tone and content of Haldane\u2019s speech suggest that the MPC will use public appearances to make the case for strong action in August. Options include cutting interest rates to 0.25% or lower, restarting the Bank\u2019s \u00a3375bn quantitative easing scheme and providing cut price loans to banks under the funding for lending scheme.<br></p> <p>Signs that the Bank is planning a major stimulus package next month put a halt to the upward move in the pound, which had rallied after Threadneedle Street left rates on hold. Sterling lost a cent against the dollar to stand at $1.3245.</p> <p>In a reference to the prison movie The Shawshank Redemption Haldane said: \u201cI would rather run the risk of taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut than taking a miniature rock hammer to tunnel my way out of prison \u2013 like another Andy, the one in the Shawshank Redemption. And yes I know Andy did eventually escape. But it did take him 20 years. The MPC does not have that same \u2018luxury\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Haldane originally made his speech in Port Talbot a week after the 23 June referendum. It has only just been released in an amended form to include references to the Bank\u2019s July interest-rate decision and to recent economic developments.</p> <p>The Bank\u2019s economist said there had been signs of the economy struggling even before the Brexit vote, but added: \u201cOver the past month, the outcome of the EU referendum has added another important ingredient to this mix. It has increased materially the degree of uncertainty \u2013 economic, policy, and political \u2013 around the UK\u2019s economic recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Haldane said the economy was unlikely to crash but was likely to slow, perhaps markedly in the quarters ahead. \u201cWhile companies and consumers might not be slamming on the brakes and going into reverse, as in 2008, some are likely to be going down a few gears, perhaps even moving into neutral. </p> <p>\u201cExternal economists expect the UK economy to tread water over the next few quarters. That means the amount of slack in the UK economy is likely to begin steadily rising in the period ahead, perhaps causing unemployment to rise.\u201d<br></p> <p>Haldane\u2019s remarks came as official figures showed that the construction industry - which accounts for around 6% of national output - was struggling before the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The sharpest fall in housebuilding since 2014 meant that construction output in May was 2.1% down on April and 2% lower than in May 2015.</p> <p>Housing output has now fallen in every month this year apart from February, and things could slow further after the 23 June Brexit vote.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/14/housing-sales-forecast-to-fall-sharply-this-summer-after-brexit-vote\">The latest figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</a>, published earlier this week, found that buyer interest and expectations of future sales withered in the post-referendum period.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A sharp fall in housebuilding ahead of the EU referendum dragged down the construction sector in May as firms mothballed projects and delayed new work. Housing construction tumbled 3.2% during the month after edging down 0.1% in April, the biggest drop since February 2014. Earlier this week the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilder, Barratt, said it could reduce the rate at which it builds new homes as the company prepares for a possible slowdown following Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. The impact of an underperforming housebuilding sector on the broader industry was to drag down output by 2.1% on the previous month and by almost 2% on the previous year. Housing output has now fallen in every month this year apart from February, and things could slow further after the 23 June Brexit vote. The latest figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, published earlier this week, found that buyer interest and expectations of future sales withered in the post-referendum period. Government cuts to local authority spending were also to blame for a fall in repairs and maintenance activity, highlighting the need for Theresa May\u2019s new infrastructure ministry to boost growth. Local authority spending on repairs and maintenance has declined sharply in real terms since the middle of 2014, mainly in response to cuts to council budgets. In May, construction firms reported a fall in new work and repairs and maintenance by 2.6% and 1.4%, respectively. \u201cThe fall in May 2016, taken together with the strength of April\u2019s figures, continues a longer trend of broadly flat output growth since the start of 2015,\u201d the ONS said. \u201cWithin all new work, there were decreases in all work types, except infrastructure. The main contribution to the decrease came from private new housing.\u201d Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the drop in construction output adds to \u201cwhat\u2019s looking like an ugly run of data for the sector\u201d. \u201cIt looks like there\u2019s worse to come; possibly much worse. Markit/CIPS PMI survey data recorded the steepest contraction of construction activity for seven years in June as projects were put on hold in the lead up to the EU referendum. Housing and commercial construction were especially badly affected,\u201d he said.",

The company said it was merging and closing bus depots in a bid to cut costs.

Two-thirds of the company\u2019s operating profit was generated in north America last year, and FirstGroup said the weakening of the pound against the dollar might boost profits once converted into sterling. However, underlying revenues at the company\u2019s north American bus firm Greyhound slid 5% in the first quarter. FirstGroup is trying to get back on track after losing several major UK rail franchises last year, including the East Coast line to Virgin and Stagecoach. This pushed it into the red in the first six months of 2015. It retained the TransPennine Express franchise in December and also runs the Great Western Railway operation. Annual results released last month showed revenues at FirstGroup\u2019s rail business plunged by 40.7% to \u00a31.3bn because it failed to keep hold of the Thameslink and ScotRail franchises.",
