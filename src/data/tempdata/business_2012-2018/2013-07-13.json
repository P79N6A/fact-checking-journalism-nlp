For Osborne, the cheque really is in the post That the privatisation of the Royal Mail was announced last week with relatively little uproar \u2013 barring threats of strikes from the Communication Workers Union \u2013 shows how much the public attitude to state sell-offs has changed.

      "bodyText": "At 9am at Gatwick airport, a hub for package holidaymakers, the morning rush is ebbing. But with schools in England and Wales starting to break up for the summer this week, this is a crucial period for a holiday industry that has been in decline for a decade. Despite predictions of its demise, the package holiday remains a popular institution among Britons. According to a poll for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), whose members sell nine out of 10 package tours booked in the UK, 48% of people booked a foreign package holiday in 2012, up from 42% in 2011 and 37% in 2010. \"Last call for Alicante,\" rings out of the tannoy, an announcement that will be heard many times at airports around the UK over the next few months. Gatwick is counting down to its busiest time of the year, when 70,000 sunseekers will take off every day, compared with a usual total nearer 55,000. Kat Rankin, 21, and her friends should by now be having breakfast in their holiday villa in Lanzarote. Instead they are killing time in the airport lounge, after a cracked plane window caused their flight from Glasgow to make an unscheduled stop in London the night before. Despite the delay, she's reasonably relaxed after spending a night in a local hotel: \"Everything was organised for us. [The tour company] contacted all the hotels and business. Had we booked it ourselves it probably would have been a lot more stressful.\" The dotcom boom made it possible for anyone to book flights and hotels at the click of a mouse and meant a fundamental change for the package holiday industry. Suddenly, there was no need to study a glossy brochure before booking a holiday at the local travel agent. The package industry seemed destined to go the way of faxes or news on teletext. Under this scenario, travel operators such as Thomas Cook, which offered its first \"package tour\" in 1841 \u2013 a rail excursion to a temperance rally in Loughborough \u2013 were set to be outgunned by budget airlines such as easyJet, founded in 1995. EasyJet and Ryanair, both big players at Gatwick, would bring low-cost jaunts to the sun to millions \u2013 as well as ushering in the foreign stag weekend. And it has been tough for Thomas Cook. The business suffered a near-death experience in 2011 as it struggled with debts of about \u00a31.5bn but it is staging a recovery under new chief executive Harriet Green, at the cost of 2,500 jobs and the closure of 195 travel agency branches. Green's counterpart at easyJet, Carolyn McCall, has also revamped the business after inheriting operational problems at Gatwick. The two companies now vie for passengers at Britain's second-largest airport. However, the death of the package holiday, like much of the overhyped rhetoric of the dotcom era, now seems like an idea that has been left out in the sun too long. Of 36m breaks taken by British holidaymakers in 2011, 15m were package tours, according to market research company Key Note, which reported a \"resurgence\" in all-inclusive package tours. The certainty of an all-inclusive price tag has attracted cost-conscious consumers trying to stick to a budget, especially when the value of sterling has been volatile, the report notes. \"In times of uncertainty the package tour company comes into its own,\" says Nicholas Batram, analyst at Peel Hunt. He says the economic squeeze has led to people dropping the Easter mini-break to Barcelona, but the summer package holiday, the main break for many, has proved resilient. \"There has been a lot of volatility and uncertainty in people's lives, whether that be the economy or jobs. The whole point of a package holiday is that \u2013 in theory \u2013 someone takes out all the stress of it for you.\" Noel Josephides, director of Sunvil holidays, who takes over as Abta chairman this month, admits that five years ago he was very concerned about the trend towards do-it-yourself holidays, with people using the internet to book flights on budget airlines, then arrange a hotel and car hire via a website too: \"We were very worried that was the way the whole market would go, but it hasn't.\" Package holidays are now a smaller market, he says, but not one that is about to disappear. \"If you're time-poor, it's very attractive to get one proven source booking everything rather than doing bits and pieces separately yourself.\" And young people are more likely to book a package, he says, than the \"silver surfers\" who prefer to organise their own holiday. If the package tour has proved resilient, this is also because holiday companies are changing. The identikit white towers on the Spanish costas \u2013 which may be on special offer anywhere on the internet \u2013 are declining in popularity. In favour now are high-end hotels, which offer \"gourmet dining\" and infinity pools, and are exclusive to the tour operator, often in destinations such as Turkey, Mexico and the Caribbean. \"We've seen a shift from short-haul, to medium- and long-haul, from commoditised [budget] to four-star and five-star hotels,\" says Karl Burns, analyst at Panmure. German-owned Tui Travel was far quicker to adapt, he says, but Thomas Cook is now beginning to transform itself too. There has been a marked shift towards exclusivity \u2013 where you can stay at certain hotels only if you book through a particular operator. Such holidays, under Tui's Sensatori, Splashworld and Couples brands, accounted for almost four fifths of the company's sales in 2011. Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook's UK and Europe chief executive, reports \"a real revival in the public perception of the package holiday\", but rejects claims that the company has been slow to respond to a changing market. It has introduced more flexibility into its holidays through \"dynamic packaging\", a booking system giving consumers greater choice in matching flight and hotel. \"We are changing ourselves as well. We are giving more flexibility into the offer,\" said Fankhauser. The glory days of the high street travel agent are passing, however. Panmure's Burns says Thomas Cook will probably close half of its 1,000 travel agencies in the next few years, with Tui closing a similar proportion of its 800 UK branches. Batram at Peel Hunt adds that the demand for package holidays is unlikely to grow as quickly as for adventure travel, but thinks the sector will remain resilient: \"A lot of people were calling the death of the package tour 10 years ago, and that hasn't been the case.\"",

In favour now are high-end hotels, which offer \"gourmet dining\" and infinity pools, and are exclusive to the tour operator, often in destinations such as Turkey, Mexico and the Caribbean.</p> <p>\"We've seen a shift from short-haul, to medium- and long-haul, from commoditised [budget] to four-star and five-star hotels,\" says Karl Burns, analyst at Panmure. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tuitravel\" title=\"\">German-owned Tui Travel</a> was far quicker to adapt, he says, but Thomas Cook is now beginning to transform itself too. There has been a marked shift towards exclusivity \u2013 where you can stay at certain hotels only if you book through a particular operator. Such holidays, under Tui's Sensatori, Splashworld and Couples brands, accounted for almost four fifths of the company's sales in 2011.</p> <p>Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook's UK and Europe chief executive, reports \"a real revival in the public perception of the package holiday\", but rejects claims that the company has been slow to respond to a changing market.</p> <p>It has introduced more flexibility into its holidays through \"dynamic packaging\", a booking system giving consumers greater choice in matching flight and hotel. \"We are changing ourselves as well. We are giving more flexibility into the offer,\" said Fankhauser.</p> <p>The glory days of the high street travel agent are passing, however. Panmure's Burns says Thomas Cook will probably close half of its 1,000 travel agencies in the next few years, with Tui closing a similar proportion of its 800 UK branches.</p> <p>Batram at Peel Hunt adds that the demand for package holidays is unlikely to grow as quickly as for adventure travel, but thinks the sector will remain resilient: \"A lot of people were calling the death of the package tour 10 years ago, and that hasn't been the case.\"</p>",
