      "bodyText": "How quickly the economic talk can change \u2013 where once the worries were of ever-booming house prices, now the conversation is over whether we have reached the peak. The discussion shows the rather disjointed housing market in Australia \u2013 not just according to location but the type of dwelling \u2013 apartment prices look set to fall, while house prices remain solid. Two months ago the picture on interest rates looked pretty clear \u2013 the next move by the RBA would be to increase rates. The market, in its infinite wisdom, had priced in a full rate rise to occur by June next year. Now the infinite wisdom is that there is no real chance of a rate change for the foreseeable future: There certainly is no reason for the RBA to hit the brakes on the economy. Inflation and wages growth is roughly \u201cnext to bugger all\u201d, employment growth looks to be coming off the boil (or, more accurately, simmer) observed in the early part of the year, and the hours worked is falling: The latest construction data, which saw a 0.7% fall in the March quarter, has some economists thinking the GDP figures out next Wednesday could show the economy went backwards in the first 3 months of this year. And the latest building approval figures out on Tuesday certainly do nothing to suggest work in the building sector is flourishing. In the past year approvals for private sector houses have fallen 8% and for apartments and flats, 19.7%: And the falls are all across the nation. Whereas at the end of last year NSW and Victoria were still booming, while the rest of the nation was shrinking, now no state has more building approvals this April compared to last year: So with the economic activity around the nation hardly looking energised, the only aspect that would have the RBA thinking about raising interest rates is housing prices. The issue for the past couple years, however, has been that the housing price boom has mostly been a Sydney and Melbourne phenomenon. And yet now data from CoreLogic suggests prices fell in May in Sydney and Melbourne. This is somewhat surprising given the most recent housing finance figures would suggest housing prices will continue to rise for at least another six months. The latest housing finance figures saw the value of finance grow by 11% over the past year: But housing prices also generally move in line with the growth of building approvals, and yet here we see that they are moving in opposite directions. While building approvals are falling, house prices look set to keep rising: So what is going on? The issue is that while Corelogic found the prices for apartments in Sydney and Melbourne fell in May, the prices for houses remained solid. This is not a big surprise \u2013 the RBA has been warning for some time about a glut in apartment building in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. While the low interest rates since 2011 has led to an increase in houses being built, the real explosion has been in apartments, but that ended in the middle of last year: In the second half of last year, the number of non-house dwelling approvals fell 22%. And a big part of that was in Sydney, which accounts for around 40% of all apartment/flat building approvals in Australia. Since the RBA began cutting rates at the end of 2011, non-house approvals have greatly outpaced those for houses in Sydney, but again in the last half of 2016 that number dropped off considerably \u2013 down 30%: And you can see from the breakdown of non-house approvals that the boom has been in apartments of greater than four stories, rather than townhouses or more standard \u201cflats\u201d. But that apartment building boom also looks to have come to an end: There are still plenty of such apartments in the pipeline, but with this massive growth in the supply of units for rent or sale has come a slowing \u2013 and now fall \u2013 in their prices. For now though, the end of the apartment building boom has not led to a similar large fall in apartment prices \u2013 certainly nothing close to a 30% fall, and certainly no real sign of any significant slowing in the growth of house prices. Given concerns of housing affordability, people are rather desperate to see the peak of the housing market. It still looks too early to say that. House prices remain solid, but the signs of slowing apartment prices in Sydney and Melbourne also point to the larger concern that the ramp up in apartment construction could lead to a glut which sees values not just slow but fall \u2013 and fall fast.",

      "bodyText": "As the election on 8 June nears, the debate has intensified over how much Britain\u2019s frothy cappuccino-drinking economy can cope without endless dollops of interest-free credit. Financial regulators are worried about it. So are the debt charity workers who pick up the pieces when the debt merry-go-round grinds to a halt. And they should be worried. Many of the biggest, shiniest new cars zipping round UK streets would still be sitting on the garage forecourt without ultra cheap credit deals that rival mortgages for their rock-bottom rates. On the high street, shops have in recent years relied more heavily on consumers using their credit cards for big purchases. Back in 2014 these shoppers could avoid paying the 18.9% interest commonly applied to credit card balances and use the two, even three-year interest-free period many card operators allow. As we know from recent experience, when debt bubbles burst, they hit everyone and drag the economy down into recession. The Bank of England\u2019s most recent data for April shows that the mania for borrowing last year and the year before has paused somewhat since January. That should be seen as good news. Net mortgage lending is down at levels seen a year ago while unsecured borrowing on credit cards and loans has stabilised at a growth rate of of just over 10% a year. But not everybody at the Bank of England will be content to see consumers putting their credit cards in a drawer. The economists attached to the BoE\u2019s interest rate-setting committee know the economy runs on debt. To adapt a well-known first world war poster, they know Britain needs borrowers. If a reminder of this basic economic rule was needed, it was made clear earlier this month when the latest UK GDP figures appeared. The relative lack of borrowing in the first three months of the year coincided with a dive in GDP growth from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2016 to 0.2% in the first quarter of this year. The BoE has busted a gut to keep the mortgage market afloat with one scheme after another to subsidise everything from deposits to the lenders themselves. It must have been upsetting to see a fall in approvals for house purchases in April for the third month in a row. Now there are signs that the credit habit is returning as almost zero interest rates work their magic again, Easter\u2019s spending is out of the way and wage rises are being outpaced by inflation. Analysts say GDP growth in the second quarter will be higher for this very reason. Is that a return of consumer confidence with shoppers shrugging off the election, they ask? Or is it, as the debt charities suspect, cash-strapped consumers rolling over their debts and taking out a bit more credit just to get by? The latest consumer surveys back up the debt charities. Markit\u2019s household survey revealed Britons are the gloomiest they\u2019ve been since 2014 about their personal finances. The GfK consumer confidence survey was down in May, according to the seasonally adjusted version. So it could be that extra borrowing is born of distress rather than confidence. And the starting point for extra borrowing on credit cards and loans is already 10% more each year. Of the nation\u2019s spenders, the Financial Conduct Authority estimates that 3.3 million are in \u201cpersistent credit card debt\u201d, which means they are paying 18.9% interest or more and suffering the consequences. That leaves Britain with a choice between accepting the assurances of regulators that they can manage the UK\u2019s tottering personal debt mountain or clamping down and risking lacklustre, sluggish growth. If only Melrose was in it for the long haul It is Bonus Bingo time again. The four top directors at Melrose Industries, an engineering group and turnaround specialist, are to share share a bonus pot of \u00a3160m, paid in shares. Each will be handed \u00a340m. The quartet run a business, just admitted to the FTSE 250, which turns around struggling manufacturers and sells them on at a premium price. They pay lots of tax due on those bonus shares \u2013 in this case \u00a370m \u2013 which they will cover by selling a few of those shares. But so much more money might have found its way into the companies owned by Melrose if only it didn\u2019t, like a private equity firm, see itself as a vehicle for extracting value and handing it to shareholders. Around \u00a33.5bn has been returned to investors over the past five years, the firm said. This money might have built some of the companies it owns into world-beating businesses. Instead, take Elster, a maker of smart electricity meters among other industrial components, which was sold in January to US firm Honeywell. The charge to Honeywell was \u00a33.3bn and two final salary pension schemes in deficit. A clever deal, no doubt. But not the kind of deal that helps UK plc, especially when the pound is low and UK businesses vulnerable to takeover.",

      "bodyText": "Some of the world\u2019s largest investment firms have thrown their weight behind efforts to combat smoking, sparking renewed calls for UK local authorities to divest all their shares in the tobacco industry from their pension fund investments. More than 50 companies managing $3.8tn (\u00a33tn) of money, including pension funds and insurers, declared support for \u201ctobacco control measures being taken around the world\u201d \u2013 even though some of them still own shares in tobacco businesses. In a joint statement, released to coincide with World No Tobacco Day, they said: \u201cWe in the investment community are becoming increasingly aware of the important role we can play in helping to address the health and societal impacts of tobacco.\u201d The firms cited studies suggesting that smoking costs the global economy more than $1tn a year, outstripping global revenues from tobacco taxes. Signatories of the statement include Axa \u2013 the French insurance firm that sold its entire \u20ac1.8bn (\u00a31.6bn) tobacco portfolio last year \u2013 and Calpers, the giant US fund with nearly $300bn of assets under management. Calpers has also divested itself of all its tobacco investments. While some large investors have sold tobacco holdings, funds managing the pension investments of UK local authority staff still own at least \u00a31bn of tobacco stocks, according to analysis by the Guardian. The share register of British American Tobacco (BAT), owner of Benson &amp; Hedges and Lucky Strike, includes 28 local government schemes, which together own a combined \u00a3700m stake in the company. The council with the largest investment in BAT is Hampshire county council, with about \u00a381m of pensioners\u2019 money invested in the firm. BAT has an office in Southampton, but ceased production of cigarettes at the site in 2007. Nottinghamshire Local Government Pension Fund is second with about \u00a362m worth of shares and is also among the largest investors in Imperial Brands, which makes Embassy and Superkings. Cigarettes were produced in Nottingham until May last year. Imperial counts 19 local authorities among its shareholders, with their investments adding up to nearly \u00a3290m. In total, share registers disclose that local authorities own close to \u00a31bn of shares in the two companies. Their total tobacco investment is likely to be higher if they are invested in separate funds that also count cigarette companies among their portfolio of shares. One of the obstacles to council pension funds selling tobacco stocks is a legal argument that trustees are obliged to prioritise the need to maximise investment returns over anything else. But guidance issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government said trustees did have some room for manoeuvre. \u201cAlthough schemes should make the pursuit of a financial return their predominant concern, they may also take purely non-financial considerations into account provided that doing so would not involve significant risk of financial detriment to the scheme and where they have good reason to think that scheme members would support their decision.\u201d Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the health charity Ash (Action on Smoking and Health), said this left the door open for selling tobacco stocks. \u201cHistorically, investment in tobacco was seen as safe, promising good returns, but increasingly fund managers are realising investing in tobacco is neither acceptable nor sustainable,\u201d she said. \u201cLocal authority pension funds have a legal duty to get the best deal for their pensioners, but if big investment funds like Axa can disinvest then surely local authorities, which have a legal duty to promote the health of local people, can do the same.\u201d Dr Bronwyn King, an oncologist who was instrumental in persuading Axa to drop its tobacco investments, said local governments should give serious thought to divesting, particularly given the cost to the public purse of smoking-related illness. \u201cWe call on all government-related pension funds and sovereign wealth funds to look again at their policy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe health sector across the world is unified on tobacco but that alone won\u2019t be enough. If the finance sector continues to invest in tobacco and strives to profit from it, we\u2019re working against each other.\u201d The statement by investors calling for tighter tobacco control was issued at a conference in Paris to mark the annual no-tobacco day, started by the World Health Organization. WHO has estimated that tobacco claims more than 7 million lives each year. Thomas Buberl, chief executive of Axa, was among the speakers at the event, a year on from the company\u2019s decision to sell all its tobacco stakes. \u201cAs the Axa group strives to be a partner in society, it is clear that action must be taken to combat the enormous human costs of tobacco,\u201d said Buberl. \u201cI am convinced we must work together if we want to bring about change. Therefore, we are very proud to be working with other major financial actors and key stakeholders in support of governments to take action on tobacco control.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Shareholders force ExxonMobil to come clean on cost of climate change", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "ExxonMobil, the world\u2019s biggest oil company, was compelled by shareholders to be more open about the impact of climate change on its business in a \u201chistoric\u201d surprise vote on Wednesday. The public rebuke came as Donald Trump reportedly prepared to pull out of the Paris climate accord, the agreement forged by close to 200 countries to address climate change. Some 62% of shareholders voted for the resolution and against Exxon\u2019s management at the company\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas, Texas. The vote to more clearly report how climate change affects Exxon\u2019s business comes as investors are increasingly demanding companies disclose the likely impact of global warming and follows the passing of similar proposals at two smaller energy companies earlier this month. Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, which led the vote, said shareholders were showing how out of step the Trump administration had become on climate change. \u201cTrump is acting contrary to Wall Street and the world\u2019s largest investors,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is a material financial risk and shareholders want to know how companies will manage the change to a low carbon economy.\u201d Exxon\u2019s management sought to head off the proposal championed by the pension funds of the Church of England, New York and California and other large shareholders, which will force the company to conduct an annual \u201cstress test\u201d measuring how its oil assets will be affected by climate change regulation and new technology. Last year, the same proposal was backed by 38% of shareholders who voted. Addressing the meeting Mason said many of the company\u2019s board members had made clear that \u201cthey recognised the significance of the agreed international goals on climate change\u201d in their other roles. Board member Ursula Burns, former CEO of Xerox, signed the Obama administration\u2019s climate pledge, and fellow board member Kenneth Frazier chairs Merck, a pharmaceutical company that supports \u201cnational and international action to address the challenges presented by climate change\u201d, said Mason. He pointed out that another board member, Susan Avery, former president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, had told the Financial Times: \u201cClearly climate science is telling us get off fossil fuels as much as possible.\u201d \u201cMembers of the board, do you leave your understanding of climate change at the door when you attend the ExxonMobil board meeting?\u201d Mason asked. Chief executive Darren Woods said: \u201cWe believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action, thoughtful action. As a company we are taking action in many ways.\u201d But he said the company was doing enough to address the impact of climate change and regulation on its business and that the board was against the proposal. \u201cThe board believes the company has adequately assessed the future impact of policy developments,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, shareholders overcame management opposition to similar proposals at Occidental Petroleum and PPL, a large utility holding company, and passed resolutions forcing the companies to more clearly explain how climate change could affect their businesses. BlackRock, Exxon\u2019s largest shareholder, backed the resolution at Occidental\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting, the first time the investment group had voted against a company\u2019s management over climate change. \u201cWhen we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive to our efforts to protect the long-term economic interests of our clients, we will not hesitate to exercise our right to vote,\u201d BlackRock said a statement. Sue Reid, vice-president of climate and energy at the sustainable investor network Ceres, called the vote \u201chistoric\u201d. \u201cThis is a very strong message from investors that climate change matters and must be addressed. Now we need to see Exxon take action.\u201d New York comptroller Thomas P DiNapoli said: \u201cThis is an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil. The burden is now on ExxonMobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.\u201d The ExxonMobil resolution, introduced by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, says that the company \u201cshould analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil\u2019s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2-degree [C] target\u201d. The resolution adds: \u201cThis reporting should assess the resilience of the company\u2019s full portfolio of reserves and resources through 2040 and beyond, and address the financial risks associated with such a scenario.\u201d The meeting, the first since former CEO Rex Tillerson left to become secretary of state, was held at the IM Pei-designed Morton H Meyerson symphony center in downtown Dallas.",

      "body": "<p>ExxonMobil, the world\u2019s biggest oil company, was compelled by shareholders to be more open about the impact of climate change on its business in a \u201chistoric\u201d surprise vote on Wednesday.</p> <p>The public rebuke came as Donald Trump reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/31/donald-trump-withdraw-paris-climate-change-agreement\">prepared to pull out</a> of the Paris climate accord, the agreement forged by close to 200 countries to address climate change.</p> <p></p> <p>Some 62% of shareholders voted for the resolution and against Exxon\u2019s management at the company\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas, Texas. The vote to more clearly report how climate change affects Exxon\u2019s business comes as investors are increasingly demanding companies disclose the likely impact of global warming and follows the passing of similar proposals at two smaller energy companies earlier this month.</p> <p>Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, which led the vote, said shareholders were showing how out of step the Trump administration had become on climate change. \u201cTrump is acting contrary to Wall Street and the world\u2019s largest investors,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is a material financial risk and shareholders want to know how companies will manage the change to a low carbon economy.\u201d</p> <p>Exxon\u2019s management sought to head off the proposal championed by the pension funds of the Church of England, New York and California and other large shareholders, which will force the company to conduct an annual \u201cstress test\u201d measuring how its oil assets will be affected by climate change regulation and new technology.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Last year, the same proposal was backed by 38% of shareholders who voted.</p> <p>Addressing the meeting Mason said many of the company\u2019s board members had made clear that \u201cthey recognised the significance of the agreed international goals on climate change\u201d in their other roles.</p> <p>Board member Ursula Burns, former CEO of Xerox, signed the Obama administration\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.xerox.com/en-us/insights/climate-change-pledge\">climate pledge</a>, and fellow board member Kenneth Frazier chairs Merck, a pharmaceutical company that supports \u201cnational and international action to address the challenges presented by climate change\u201d, said Mason. He pointed out that another board member, Susan Avery, former president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, had <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d87ce444-e388-11e6-8405-9e5580d6e5fb\">told the Financial Times</a>: \u201cClearly climate science is telling us get off fossil fuels as much as possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMembers of the board, do you leave your understanding of climate change at the door when you attend the ExxonMobil board meeting?\u201d Mason asked.</p> <p>Chief executive Darren Woods said: \u201cWe believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action, thoughtful action. As a company we are taking action in many ways.\u201d</p> <p>But he said the company was doing enough to address the impact of climate change and regulation on its business and that the board was against the proposal. \u201cThe board believes the company has adequately assessed the future impact of policy developments,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Earlier this month, shareholders overcame management opposition to similar proposals at Occidental Petroleum and PPL, a large utility holding company, and passed resolutions forcing the companies to more clearly explain how climate change could affect their businesses. <br></p> <p>BlackRock, Exxon\u2019s largest shareholder, backed the resolution at Occidental\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting, the first time the investment group had voted against a company\u2019s management over climate change.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive to our efforts to protect the long-term economic interests of our clients, we will not hesitate to exercise our right to vote,\u201d BlackRock said a <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/en-gb/literature/publication/blk-vote-bulletin-occidental-may-2017.pdf\">statement</a>.<br></p> <p>Sue Reid, vice-president of climate and energy at the sustainable investor network Ceres, called the vote \u201chistoric\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a very strong message from investors that climate change matters and must be addressed. Now we need to see Exxon take action.\u201d</p> <p>New York comptroller Thomas P DiNapoli said: \u201cThis is an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil. The burden is now on ExxonMobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ExxonMobil resolution, introduced by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, says that the company \u201cshould analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil\u2019s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2-degree [C] target\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The resolution adds: \u201cThis reporting should assess the resilience of the company\u2019s full portfolio of reserves and resources through 2040 and beyond, and address the financial risks associated with such a scenario.\u201d<br></p> <p>The meeting, the first since former CEO Rex Tillerson left to become secretary of state, was held at the IM Pei-designed Morton H Meyerson symphony center in downtown Dallas.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The recovery in the pound has left the FTSE 100 in the red after the index earlier hit a new all time peak, and it was a fairly mixed picture elsewhere. With Wall Street falling back, European markets had an uncertain feel about them, with concerns about the forthcoming elections, not just in the UK but in Germany and perhaps Italy too. But despite this, they did manage to record their fourth straight month of gains, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index up 0.9% in May. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 6.56 points or 0.09% at 7519.95 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.13% to 12,615.06 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.42% lower at 5283.63 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.4% to 20,731.68 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.03% at 10,880.0 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.10% to 775.24 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 40 points or 0.19%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s Reuters on the correction to the earlier Chicago purchasing managers\u2019 report: The initially reported headline figure for the Chicago PMI was apparently incorrect and Market News International has \u201crevised\u201d it to 59.4 from 55.2 first reported. The update changed the entire complexion of the original report and renders earlier market analysis largely inoperative. It took the headline index from an initial report of a 4-month low to being a 30-month high. MNI removed the original May release from the ISM-Chicago website but did not explain its error. More on the UK election opinion polls: A recovery in the pound on the latest opinion poll news has taken the shine off the FTSE 100. Sterling is currently up 0.34% against the dollar at $1.2903, up from its low of $1.2767. The late positive run for the currency has seen the FTSE 100, which hit an intra-day high of 7586, slip into the red at the close, down 0.09% at 7519.95. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling is flying at month end. Some month-end positioning and new polls showing a renewed Tory lead helped lift the pound over the $1.29 handle, amid signs that trading in sterling will be fairly choppy in the coming days. It looks like the foreign exchange market has decided to shrug off that YouGov survey which indicated a hung parliament is the most likely outcome from the June 8th poll. Instead the pound was buoyed by a PanelBase poll that gives the Tories a very healthy 15-point lead over Labour. Following on from this a Kantar poll added to the positive sentiment after it revealed the Conservative share of the vote had ticked up one percentage point in the last week, to 43%. Meanwhile there are reports that the Chicago data from earlier has been corrected. The purchasing managers\u2019 index was initially said to have fallen from 58.3 to 55.2, but now it has apparently been revised to show a rise to 59.4. Connor Campbell, marketing analyst at Spreadex, said: You can tell the election is just over a week away, as the market has been abuzz with volatility this Wednesday afternoon. In the UK polls have continued to be the main driver of trading, with the UK markets remarkably sensitive to each individual survey. The latest report came from PanelBase, which gave Theresa May\u2019s Tories a 15-point lead over Labour, news that not only helped the pound erase its losses against the dollar, but sent the FTSE to a fresh all-time high. The fact that the pair moved in the same direction is notable, suggesting that the FTSE wants a Tory win just as badly as sterling, even if the weakened pound has been the main driver behind the UK index travelling to its current record levels. Things have calmed down since then, however. The FTSE has reverted to the 20 point rise it saw this morning, leaving it 40 or so points away from its intraday peak. As for the pound, while it has held onto its growth against the greenback, it still finds itself in the red against the euro, though sterling has lifted away from its 2 and a half week lows. Sterling has now recovered all its lost ground against the dollar, as a new poll from Kantar shows the Conservatives increasing their lead over Labour from 8 points to 10 points. Sterling is now 0.2% better at $1.2882 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2767. Against the euro the pound has recovered to \u20ac1.1476, down 0.16% after being as low as \u20ac1.1432. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has fallen back from its record highs and is now up just 20 points or 0.27%. Back with the UK, and ratings agency Moody\u2019s has raised its forecast for economic growth this year but warns Brexit related uncertainty will have an effect eventually. It said: The British economy grew at a quarterly annualised rate of only 0.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Consumer spending, which has been a strong driver of growth since mid-2016, is slowing as a rise in inflation squeezes real wages. We expect that the UK economy will grow around 1.5% this year, slowing further to 1% in 2018 owing to a slowdown in investment amid Brexit-related uncertainty. The upward revision to our 2017 forecast from 1% previously recognises that the speed of the slowdown so far has turned out to be more moderate than we had previously estimated. Otherwise, we have not fundamentally changed our view that post-Brexit uncertainty will eventually weigh on economic activity. The agency\u2019s other key points in its latest global assessment include: The improving outlook for global growth in 2017 appears to be sustainable as some of the biggest risks to advanced economies have subsided and emerging markets maintain their expansion. Moody\u2019s expects G20 economies, which account for 78% of the global economy, to collectively grow at an annual rate of 3.1% in 2017 and 2018, compared with growth of 2.6% in 2016. The potential damage to global trade and economic growth from a pursuit of protectionist policies in the US, and consequent retaliation, seems to have diminished for now. Moody\u2019s expects the ongoing recovery to continue in 2017 and 2018, supported by accommodative monetary conditions, a strengthening global economy and rising employment. The outcome of the French presidential election should also support recovery because it significantly reduces the risk of a European Union exit by a major economy. Another set of US data has missed expectations. Sales of previously owned US homes fell by 1.3% in April, compared to forecasts of a 0.5% rise. This is the second straightly monthly decline, according to the National Association of Realtors. The year on year fall was 3.3%, the first decline since December and the largest since June 2014. The association\u2019s chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Much of the country for the second straight month saw a pullback in pending sales as the rate of new listings continues to lag the quicker pace of homes coming off the market. Realtors are indicating that foot traffic is higher than a year ago, but it\u2019s obviously not translating to more sales. Prospective buyers are feeling the double whammy this spring of inventory that\u2019s down 9.0 percent from a year ago and price appreciation that\u2019s much faster than any rise they\u2019ve likely seen in their income. Despite Canada\u2019s impressive economic growth in the first quarter, the International Monetary Fund points to possible problems ahead: In the wake of the poor Chicago data, US markets have gone into reverse. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 34 points or 0.17%, while the Nasdaq composite - have earlier hit a new high - has now slipped around 0.1%. The S&amp;P 500 is also down a similar amount. Over in the US, and a disappointing outcome from the latest Chicago purchasing managers\u2019 index: This is the slowest rate of growth since January. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the UK was the joint-slowest G7 economy in the first three months of this year: Over in New York, the Nasdaq has just hit another record high at the start of trading. City traders are catching their breath after a busy morning of sterling volatility, and another record high on the FTSE 100. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, sums up the morning: What a comedy show this is turning out to be. Last night saw sterling tumble after research by the Times newspaper and YouGov suggested that there could be a hung parliament. Today, it retraced all of those losses after a Panelbase Poll showed that the Conservatives\u2019 lead was not only intact but that it had risen to 48% from 47% previously, while the Labour party remained unchanged at 33%. Razaqzada adds that we should \u201cget used\u201d to the volatility. Sterling is currently reacting negatively to any narrowing in the polls between the two major parties mainly because of the threat of Labour\u2019s promise of corporation tax increases, which is deemed by the market as growth-chocking and not so business-friendly. If new polls show support for Theresa May is falling then the pound could fall once again, and vice versa. It is as simple as that. Thus, UK data should continue to play second fiddle to politics until the elections are over. Meanwhile, the stock market is enjoying its best month of 2017. Selling in May and going away wouldn\u2019t have paid off this year, yet anyway...... Newsflash: Canada\u2019s economy grew by an impressive 0.9% in the first three months of this year, outpacing other advanced economies. Household spending and business investment helped to drive growth across the country in January to March, new figures show. It\u2019s a little weaker than expected; some economists forecast growth of above 4%. But it\u2019s still means the Canadian economy is expanding at a healthy pace. Canada is the final member of the G7 to report its growth figures. And we can now see that the United Kingdom is officially the joint-worst performing member of the G7 so far this year. Britain\u2019s GDP only expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2017, as rising inflation and weak net trade dragged the economy back. That was a much sharper slowdown than feared. Figures released last week showed that Britain\u2019s \u201cconsumer facing industries\u201d suffered a slowdown, exports fell, and the dominant service sector struggled as the weaker pound pushed up import prices. Here are the growth rates for the G7 members in the first quarter of this year: Canadian GDP: +0.9% growth German GDP: +0.6% growth Japanese GDP: +0.5% growth French GDP: +0.4% growth US GDP: +0.3% growth UK GDP: +0.2% growth Italian GDP: +0.2% growth Newsflash: India\u2019s economy grew slower than expected in the first three months of this year. Indian GDP expanded by 6.1% over the year, weaker than expected. Economists had forecast annual growth of between 6.5% and 7.8%. The FTSE 100 is continuing to hit new record highs. It\u2019s now reached 7576 points for the first time ever, up 49 points (or 0.66%). Banks are leading the way, with Standard Chartered up 3.3% and Barclays gaining 2.4%. Fashion chain Burberry is in demand too, with shares up 3.1%. Britain\u2019s blue-chip index has just hit a new alltime high, as general election action continue to grip the City. The FTSE 100 index has hit 7563, up 37 points today, and breaking through last Friday\u2019s peak of 7554 points. Shares pushed higher after PanelBase\u2019s new poll gave the Conservative\u2019s a 15 point lead was released, calming fears over a hung parliament. \u201cThe markets seem to be saying that a strong Tory majority is better for the pound and better for equities,\u201d explains Neil Wilson of ETX. The pound\u2019s sensitivity to these opinion polls is a little concerning. This chart shows how sterling hit a six-week low after YouGov predicted a hung parliament, but bounced back as Panelbase reported a solid Conservative lead of 15 points. Newsflash: The pound is pushing higher after a new opinion poll gave Theresa May a 15 percentage point lead ahead of next week\u2019s election. Panelbase report that the Conservative Party have 48% support, compared to Labour\u2019s 33%. That has sent sterling back up to $1.284, clawing back most of the losses since the YouGov poll released last night. James Andrews, head of investment management at Redmayne-Bentle, predicts that the pound is entering choppy waters. He fears that further losses against the euro and the dollar are likely, as the European economy recovers. We are likely to continue to see volatility in the Pound in the run-up to the election, and indeed for the foreseeable future, as Brexit negotiations step-up post the outcome of the election. Given the prolonged uncertainty ahead of us, not to mention this short-term election-driven uncertainty, it seems any relief rallies will be just that, and the Pound will find it difficult to sustain any upward momentum. In addition, further rate rises in the US and stronger fundamentals from the European economy will likely see strengthening of the Euro and the Dollar, providing further headwinds for Sterling going forward.\u201d The pound isn\u2019t looking particularly strong and stable. Instead, the worst-performing major currency so far today. Sterling has now sunk to a six-week low against the US dollar as the selloff picks up pace. The pound has fallen to $1.278, its lowest level since Theresa May called a general election on April 18th. The news that Britain\u2019s mortgage approvals hit a seven-month low in April pushed the pound lower: YouGov\u2019s prediction that Theresa May could fail to win a majority in next week\u2019s general election is also weighing on the pound, despite some scepticism over its accuracy. Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management suggests the pound may bounce back, as other polls show the Conservatives winning a working majority. \u201cThe latest poll suggesting a hung parliament is likely has shaken markets. Were this to be the outcome of the General Election on 8 June, we can expect a repeat of this behaviour, with significant volatility in sterling. Yet today\u2019s poll distracts from the many others showing that a Conservative majority remains the most likely outcome, as is our base case. With no further indications of a hung parliament, the recent fall in sterling may be seen as a buying opportunity for investors. Unemployment across the eurozone has hits its lowest level since the financial crisis, in another sign that Europe\u2019s recovery is gathering pace. The eurozone jobless rate dipped to 9.3% in April, reports Eurostat, the lowest in over eight year. March\u2019s figure has been revised down from 9.5% to 9.4%. Across the whole European Union, the jobless rate fell to 7.8%, from 7.9%. Eurostat estimates that 19.121 million men and women in the EU were unemployed last month, including 15.040 million in the euro area. Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (3.2%), Germany (3.9%) and Malta (4.1%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (23.2% in February 2017) and Spain (17.8%). The eurozone youth unemployment remains disappointingly high, though, at 18.7%. There are now 2.617 million under-25s out of work, a drop of 419,000 compared with a year ago. Newsflash: inflation across the eurozone has fallen to 1.4% this month, down from 1.9% in April. That\u2019s a sharp drop, as prices returned to more normal levels following Easter. It should encourage the European Central Bank not to risk tightening monetary policy too quickly. Eurostat reports that energy prices rose by 4.6% compared with a year ago, due to the pickup in the oil price. Food, alcohol and tobacco prices rose by 1.5%, service sector prices gained 1.3%m, while industrial goods only inched up by 0.3%. Breaking: Britain\u2019s housing market cooled off in April, with mortgage approvals falling to a seven month low. Just 64,645 mortgages were approved by banks and building societies last month, new figures show. That\u2019s the smallest increase since September 2016. Net mortgage lending also cooled off, with the smallest increase in a year, in another sign that potential housebuyers are being more cautious. Today\u2019s figure follow signs that house price growth has been slowing, particularly in London. British households have become more upbeat about their personal finances and the economy despite the political uncertainty and rising prices in the shops, according to a new survey. UK consumer confidence defied economists\u2019 forecasts for a dip and instead edged higher in May as measured in a monthly barometer from market researchers GfK. Its main index rose to -5 from -7 in April. Despite a rise in inflation and stalling wage growth, households were more upbeat about the state of their finances, the outlook for their finances and the state of the economy when compared with April. But on all three measures they were less confident than a year ago, when the UK had yet to vote for Brexit. The poll of 2,000 people on behalf of the European Commission also showed people were more confident this month that now was a good time to make a major purchase such as furniture. \u201cWe have an unexpected uptick in the barometer this month,\u201d said GfK spokesman Joe Staton. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s unemployment rate has hit its lowest rate since the country was reunified 27 years ago. The jobless rate across Europe\u2019s largest economy fell to 5.7% in May, new figures from the German Labour Office show, down from 5.8% in April. The number of people out of work fell by 9,000 this month, on a seasonally adjusted basis, to 2.536 million. This should cause some relief in Berlin, following some weaker-than-expected German retail sales figures this morning. Takings surprisingly fell by 0.2% in April, dashing hopes of a 0.2% rise. The pound\u2019s decline has helped to push up the value of multinational firms listed in London. Consumer goods giant Unilever, international packaging firm Monti and information group RELX (formerly Reed Elsevier) have all gained around 1%. This has pushing the FTSE 100 up by 20 points to 7545, only 10 points away from breaking last week\u2019s alltime high. Edward Hardy of currency exchange firm World First reckons YouGov\u2019s poll should come with a \u201ca major health warning\u201d. Pollsters don\u2019t usually project constituencies seat-by-seat and there\u2019s a reason why; the margin of error leaves the likelihood of this poll coming true particularly small. It\u2019s a very fair point; City strategist Ioan Smith has also pointed to the large margin of error: But that hasn\u2019t stopped the pound shedding half a cent against the dollar since the poll came out. Sterling has also lost ground against the euro this morning, losing 0.4% to \u20ac1.145. That means one euro is now worth 87.33p (compared to 76p before last June\u2019s EU referendum). Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale believes the euro will keep climbing against the pound: The importance of politics as a market driver currently can\u2019t be overstated. Perhaps that shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone when the economic backdrop is relatively dull. This morning, the pound is the main victim again as a YouGov poll points to a possible hung parliament as the Conservatives risk losing seats in next week\u2019s election. We\u2019re supposed to treat polls with suspicion but needless to say, we remain bullish of EUR/GBP even if I\u2019ve lost my bet that it would trade above 0.90 by the start of this week Kathleen Brooks of City Index is sceptical about YouGov\u2019s prediction, arguing that the pollster\u2019s methodology is too untested to make such sweeping claims. She thinks it most likely that the Conservatives will win a small majority, but fears that even this could hit the pound. We think there is a chance of a deeper sell off back towards $1.20 if it looks like Theresa May won\u2019t have a big enough mandate to agree a trade deal with the UK. The prospect of no deal from the Brexit negotiations has spooked investors and may continue to do so after this election. This could weigh on sterling and the broader FTSE 350 index. There\u2019s only a \u2018slim chance\u2019 of a hung parliament, she reckons -- but it would certainly hurt sterling and share prices if it happened. We would expect the political uncertainty that could arise from a hung parliament and a potential change in leadership would weigh heavily on the pound and the FTSE 100. YouGov\u2019s shock forecast that the Conservative Party could lose 20 seats in next week\u2019s election is the talk of City this morning. The suggestion that Britain could be left with a hung parliament next week has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the financial markets, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He says: A hung parliament is the nightmare scenario for May. It would constitute a massive personal failure and undoubtedly make for great domestic political uncertainty at the worst possible moment for Britain. If Mrs May fails to get the thumping majority she hopes for, her position will be a lot less secure than before she called the snap election. Mrs May has made this campaign particularly personal and a failure to secure a large swathe of new Tory MPs would be seen a failure of hers. This risks throwing open a Tory leadership contest and the prospect of a hard-line Brexiteer in charge. Boris Johnson is waiting in the wings. A hung parliament could easily see Jeremy Corbyn become prime minister \u2013 investors simply wouldn\u2019t know where they stood. And that means the pound is now saddled with an \u201cadded political premium\u201d until the result is known. A new forecast that Britain could be left with a hung parliament next week has knocked the pound. Sterling fell below $1.28 after YouGov analysis , published in The Times, suggested that Theresa May could be left 16 seats short of an overall majority. This prediction has caused some alarm in the foreign exchange markets, where traders had been expecting that the Conservatives would secure a large majority. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, explains: In the currency market, it is the British Pound which has attracted the most attention as the latest polls from YouGov shows that the big gamble by Theresa May could cost her majority lead in parliament. This is not something which she has pictured but again, the same story goes for David Cameron when he took the gamble for the Brexit vote. The YouGov poll shows that her party could lose as much as 20 seats and Labour could gain nearly 30 additional seats. So much for all the rhetoric \u201cmaking her hand strong in the parliament\u201d. This has taken a toll on the British pound, and it has lost ground against a basket of currencies. Aslam believes the pound is vulnerable to further losses too: Investors are worried about a hung parliament, and if we get more polling data which confirms that the possibility of a hung parliament is more real, we could see the British pound losing ground against the dollar and the Euro. We do think that the sterling-dollar pair could drop all the way to 1.26 mark if we break the support of 1.2752. YouGov\u2019s forecasts is controversial, though, as polling companies don\u2019t usually produce these kind of seat-by-seat projections. And The Times itself admits that the estimates has plenty of wiggle room, saying: \u201cThe poll allows for big variations, however, and suggests that the Tories could get as many as 345 seats on a good night, 15 more than at present, and as few as 274 seats on a bad night,\u201d But still, it\u2019s enough to get traders jittery..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be watching the pound closely, as Britain\u2019s general election campaign enters the final stretch ahead of the June 8 dash to the polls. The latest opinion polls are painting a mixed pictures; some suggest a solid Tory majority, others reckon Theresa May could even lose seats, so it\u2019s a testing time to be a currency trader. New economic data from the eurozone will hit the wires this morning. It\u2019s likely to show that Europe kept creating jobs last month, as the recovery from the debt crisis continues. The eurozone\u2019s inflation rate probably also fell sharply this month; taking some of the heat off the European Central Bank to consider tightening its stimulus programme. Canada will also be in focus later, when its first quarter growth figures are released. It\u2019s likely to have been one of the best-performing advanced economies in Q1, outpacing the UK. The agenda: 8.55am BST: German unemployment figures for May; the jobless total is expected to fall by around 15,000 9.30am: UK consumer credit figures for April 10am BST: Eurozone unemployment figures for April; the jobless rate is expected to drop to 9.4% from 9.5% 10am BST: Eurozone inflation figures for May; CPI rate is expected to drop to 1.5% from 1.9% 1.30pm BST: Canadian GDP for the first quarter of 2017; economists predict annualised growth of around 4%",

      "bodyText": "A series of conflicting general election opinion polls led to a day of volatile trading on the foreign exchange market during which the pound slumped to a six-week low before recovering all of the lost ground and more. The FTSE 100 initially shrugged off any political worries to hit another new all-time high, although the late rebound in sterling pushed it into the red by the close. A YouGov poll predicting a hung parliament set the ball rolling, sending the pound as low as $1.2767 against the dollar in early trading, its worst level in six weeks. The poll, published in the Times on Wednesday morning, suggested that the Conservatives could be left 16 seats short of an overall majority. But a later survey from Panelbase gave the party a 15-point lead, putting it on 48% compared with Labour\u2019s 33%, while a subsequent poll from Kantar put the lead at 10 points, up from eight points a week ago. So from its lows, the pound recovered to show a gain of 0.31% to $1.2900, while against the euro it was down just 0.08% at \u20ac1.1482, after earlier falling as low as \u20ac1.1428. James Andrews, head of investment management at Redmayne-Bentley, said he expected further volatility in the run-up to the election and as Brexit negotiations stepped up. He said: \u201cGiven the prolonged uncertainty ahead of us, not to mention this short-term election-driven uncertainty, it seems any relief rallies will be just that, and the pound will find it difficult to sustain any upward momentum. In addition, further rate rises in the US and stronger fundamentals from the European economy will likely see strengthening of the euro and the dollar, providing further headwinds for sterling going forward.\u201d The early slide in sterling gave a lift to the FTSE 100, with its overseas earners such as Burberry and Diageo benefiting from a weaker pound. The index climbed to a new peak of 7586, beating the 7554 reached on Friday, but it fell back to close at 7519.95, down 0.09%, as the pound reversed course. But the index did record its best monthly performance since December, up 4.46% in May, helped by the UK currency\u2019s recent weakness and some signs of recovery in the global economy. The latest positive trends showed UK consumer confidence edging higher in May, while in the eurozone, unemployment was at its lowest level since March 2009. With more polls due in the run-up to the election, markets could be unnerved by any signs of the Conservatives winning only a small majority, said Kathleen Brooks of City Index. \u201cWe think there is a chance of a deeper sell-off back towards $1.20 if it looks like Theresa May won\u2019t have a big enough mandate to agree a trade deal with the UK. The prospect of no deal from the Brexit negotiations has spooked investors and may continue to do so after this election. This could weigh on sterling and the broader FTSE 350 index.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A series of conflicting general election opinion polls led to a day of volatile trading on the foreign exchange market during which the pound slumped to a six-week low before recovering all of the lost ground and more.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 initially shrugged off any political worries to hit another new all-time high, although the late rebound in sterling pushed it into the red by the close.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/31/yougov-poll-predicting-hung-parliament-brave\">YouGov poll predicting a hung parliament</a> set the ball rolling, sending the pound as low as $1.2767 against the dollar in early trading, its worst level in six weeks. The poll, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/latest-general-election-poll-predicts-conservatives-will-lose-seats-02zfwl8lc\">published in the Times</a> on Wednesday morning, suggested that the Conservatives could be left 16 seats short of an overall majority.</p> <p>But a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/may/31/pound-hung-parliament-eurozone-inflation-unemployment-business-live?page=with:block-592e9ac8e4b00493c8277cca#block-592e9ac8e4b00493c8277cca\">later survey from Panelbase</a> gave the party a 15-point lead, putting it on 48% compared with Labour\u2019s 33%, while a subsequent poll from Kantar put the lead at 10 points, up from eight points a week ago.</p> <p>So from its lows, the pound recovered to show a gain of 0.31% to $1.2900, while against the euro it was down just 0.08% at \u20ac1.1482, after earlier falling as low as \u20ac1.1428. James Andrews, head of investment management at Redmayne-Bentley, said he expected further volatility in the run-up to the election and as Brexit negotiations stepped up.</p> <p>He said: \u201cGiven the prolonged uncertainty ahead of us, not to mention this short-term election-driven uncertainty, it seems any relief rallies will be just that, and the pound will find it difficult to sustain any upward momentum. In addition, further rate rises in the US and stronger fundamentals from the European economy will likely see strengthening of the euro and the dollar, providing further headwinds for sterling going forward.\u201d</p> <p>The early slide in sterling gave a lift to the FTSE 100, with its overseas earners such as Burberry and Diageo benefiting from a weaker pound. The index climbed to a new peak of 7586, beating the 7554 reached on Friday, but it fell back to close at 7519.95, down 0.09%, as the pound reversed course.</p> <p>But the index did record its best monthly performance since December, up 4.46% in May, helped by the UK currency\u2019s recent weakness and some signs of recovery in the global economy. The latest positive trends showed UK consumer confidence edging higher in May, while in the eurozone, unemployment was at its lowest level since March 2009.</p> <p>With more polls due in the run-up to the election, markets could be unnerved by any signs of the Conservatives winning only a small majority, said Kathleen Brooks of City Index. \u201cWe think there is a chance of a deeper sell-off back towards $1.20 if it looks like Theresa May won\u2019t have a big enough mandate to agree a trade deal with the UK. The prospect of no deal from the Brexit negotiations has spooked investors and may continue to do so after this election. This could weigh on sterling and the broader FTSE 350 index.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK has slumped to the bottom of the league table of advanced economies after Canada registered stellar growth in the first three months of the year. Canada was the final member of the G7 to report its growth figures, which confirmed the UK as officially the joint worst performing member so far this year. The announcement marked a significant decline for the UK economy, which a year ago was outshining Germany, the US and Japan. In February it was announced that Germany had pipped the UK as the fastest-growing G7 nation during 2016 by 10 basis points. However, the latest figures for Canada, which showed that growth accelerated to 0.9% in the first quarter, putting it top of the G7 performers, has left Britain languishing alongside Italy at the bottom of the table. Germany is in second spot at 0.6%, followed by Japan with 0.5%, France 0.4% and the US at 0.3%. The UK and Italy are then level on growth of just 0.2%. The sluggish expansion in the first quarter provides the latest evidence that the early resilience to the EU referendum result last June is now wearing off as higher inflation puts consumers under pressure. Prices have been increasing since the Brexit vote because the referendum result sent the pound sharply lower and has raised the cost of imports to the UK. That higher inflation has hit household budgets and dented the main driver of UK growth, consumer spending. The Bank of England said earlier this month that it expected GDP growth would edge up marginally to 1.9% for 2017 from 1.8% in 2016. But it warned that living standards would fall this year because inflation would be higher than pay growth. Credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s added on Wednesday that the Brexit-related slowdown in the UK had been more modest than expected and that it had raised its forecast for growth this year to 1.5% from 1%. It added: \u201cNonetheless, Moody\u2019s still expects weaker growth as investment spending slows as Brexit negotiations get under way and consumers feel the impact of accelerating inflation.\u201d There do not appear to be any such concerns in Canada, however, where the national statistics agency said real gross domestic product grew at an annualised rate of 3.7% in the first three months of the year, helped most recently by a boost to household spending and a turnaround in business investment. The figure was below expectations of 3.9%, according to Thomson Reuters, but was still lauded by economists. \u201cAt the end of the day, we have to call it strong no matter what,\u201d said Derek Holt, an economist at Scotiabank. \u201cA lot of other countries would like to be in this position. If we continue to get growth numbers like this, absent trade policy risks, it\u2019s going to be tougher for the Bank of Canada to avoid rate hikes at some point in the distance,\u201d Holt said. The Canadian economy also appeared to be on a solid footing going into the second quarter, with growth rising by a better-than-expected 0.5% in March on the back of stronger activity in the manufacturing and retail trade sectors. Growth was also supported by businesses rebuilding their inventories, which economists said could be reversed in coming quarters. Meanwhile, consumers continued to spend, particularly on vehicles. Wages rose by 1% compared with the previous quarter and the savings rate fell to 4.3% from 5.3%.",

      "bodyText": "The four top directors at UK turnaround specialist Melrose Industries are to share a bonus pot of \u00a3160m in one of the biggest corporate paydays in the City. The UK-listed engineering firm said on Wednesday it would pay out share bonuses to its three co-founders and the finance chief under a five-year incentive plan, which was approved by investors in 2012. Based on the average share price over the past 40 days of 234p, the total bonus pot is worth \u00a3240m. The quartet \u2013 Christopher Miller, executive chairman; David Roper, executive vice chairman; Simon Peckham, chief executive; and Geoff Martin, chief financial officer \u2013 are entitled to 68% of it. This means they will get \u00a340m each in shares. The remainder of the pot will be shared between 20 senior managers. The executives can sell shares to cover the \u00a370m of income tax due on the awards but must retain at least half the remaining shares for at least two years. They have never sold any shares, except to cover tax bills. At present, the four directors together own 2.25% of Melrose, which will rise to 3.1% after the share awards. The rest is owned by financial institutions led by BlackRock. Melrose stressed that the bonus plan was strongly aligned to shareholder returns, with \u00a33.5bn returned to investors over the five-year period. The firm buys and turns around struggling manufacturing businesses before selling them on. Melrose\u2019s share price has soared from 42.97p five years ago to 236p on Wednesday. The company was founded and floated on the stock market in 2003 as a cash shell by Miller, Roper and Peckham, who put about \u00a33m into the business. Melrose is listed in the FTSE small cap index but is expected to rejoin the FTSE 250 soon. It declared a statutory loss before tax of \u00a369.3m last year. Excluding restructuring, acquisition and disposal costs, it made an underlying pretax profit of \u00a396m, with revenues of \u00a3889m. The bonus payouts are among the biggest in City history, but are dwarfed by the \u00a370m pay package awarded to WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell in 2015, including a \u00a363m payout from a long-term incentive scheme, which triggered a shareholder revolt. Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of housebuilder Berkeley Group, received pay packets of \u00a321.5m and \u00a323.3m in the past two years. At Melrose, Peckham was paid \u00a3987,000 last year, while Martin got \u00a3803,000, Miller \u00a3549,000 and Roper \u00a3548,000. A new three-year incentive plan, which starts on Thursday, was endorsed by 83% of shareholders at an annual meeting earlier this month. It contains a number of new \u201cshareholder-friendly\u201d clauses, such as malus clauses, which mean share payouts can be clawed back if in certain circumstances. The size of the payout will depend on how much executives improve acquired businesses and sell them for. Last summer Melrose spent \u00a32.2bn on Nortek, a US firm that makes kitchen stove hoods and extractor fans.",

Edmonds \u2013 a quiz show host and former Radio 1 DJ and children\u2019s TV presenter \u2013 has accused Lloyds of \u201cfoot dragging\u201d over compensation payments. He made a personal intervention earlier this month, writing to Lord Blackwell criticising the chairman of Lloyds for the lack of urgency displayed to \u201cright the grievous wrongs for which it is responsible\u201d. He told the Lloyds chairman that he had decided to speak out on behalf of other victims because his celebrity status allowed \u201cmy voice [to be] heard more loudly than the other fraud victims who do not enjoy my profile\u201d. Edmonds is seeking \u00a373m in compensation for what he claims is the destruction of his Unique business empire together with public humiliation and damage to his reputation. His law firm Keystone Law wrote to the bank\u2019s chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, demanding compensation earlier this month. In his letter to Blackwell, Edmonds said his business was \u201cbrought crashing down\u201d as a result. \u201cNot only did this cost me a vast amount financially, but it caused me great public humiliation, frustration and distress,\u201d he added. The Deal or No Deal host said he was a client of former HBOS employee Mark Dobson, who was sentenced to four and a half years in prison along with five others after a jury heard they spent the proceeds of their \u00a3245m loans scam on superyachts and sex parties, while destroying businesses to which they had lent money. The fraud took place in the run-up to Lloyds\u2019 rescue of HBOS during the 2008 banking crisis. Lloyds has confirmed that Edmond\u2019s case has been included in the compensation review being overseen by Griggs. \u201cWe remain on track to begin making the first compensation offers before the end of May and anticipate making compensation offers by the end of June to all customers who have confirmed their participation in the review,\u201d the bank said earlier this month.",

    "webTitle": "Strong sales growth at Aldi and Lidl takes their market share to 12%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shoppers are turning to discounters and supermarkets\u2019 own label goods as price rises pick up across the grocery market. The German chains Aldi and Lidl are growing at their fastest rate in more than two years as supermarkets raise prices following the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote, which has pushed up the cost of imported goods. Sales at Aldi rose by 19.8% and at Lidl by 18.3% in the 12 weeks to 21 May, while the UK\u2019s big four supermarkets, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons, collectively grew by just 1.6%, according to market share data from Kantar Worldpanel. The German chains\u2019 rapid growth took their combined market share to a new high of 12%, as 1.1m more cash-strapped consumers in search of a better deal visited their stores. Lidl, which holds 5% of the UK grocery market, is expected to overtake Waitrose, which has a 5.2% share, as the seventh biggest chain briefly this summer and consolidate its position next year. Meanwhile, supermarkets\u2019 own label sales rose by 6.0% year on year in contrast to a 0.6% rise in branded products as shoppers looked for a cheaper alternative. Chris Hayward, consumer specialist at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \u201cConsumers are starting to feel the pinch as prices continue to rise.\u201d Grocery market inflation rose to 2.9% in the 12-week period, up from 2.6% reported last month. Hayward said the rise meant families had to spend \u00a327 more for the same basket of goods over the period. \u201cThat may not seem like much, but if inflation continues at its current rate over the course of a year that would mean an extra \u00a3119 spent on groceries per household,\u201d he added. Inflation underpinned the second consecutive period in which all the major chains achieved growth. The overall market grew by 3.8% year on year, the market\u2019s best performance since September 2013. Hayward said a drive for healthy eating \u2013 perhaps after the excesses of Easter, when the nation consumed \u00a3325m of chocolate eggs \u2013 had also helped boost performance. The amount of mineral water sold rose 7.4%, while eggs were up by 5.1% and fresh produce up 2.1%. In contrast, sales of sugar were down 5.6% year on year. But the market researchers Nielsen found that the grocery market had increased sales in total by just 0.2% as food price inflation had been offset by a 2.3% fall in the volume of goods sold. \u201cThe return of inflation has helped supermarkets grow sales but the challenge for the summer is to sustain this by encouraging shoppers to put more items into the weekly basket,\u201d said Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight. But he added: \u201cRising inflation means people will be more aware of balancing household budgets, which may encourage spending more on eating at home, rather than at restaurants.\u201d Bank of England lending figures showed that consumers had also become more cautious before dipping their toes in the housing market. Approvals for house purchases fell for the fourth consecutive month to 64,645, while approvals for remortgaging loans tumbled to 40,575 from 45,551 in January. Net lending secured in April was \u00a32.7bn, the lowest for a year, the Bank said. Nationwide Building Society said last week that consumers were alert to the economic risks associated with the Brexit negotiations. It forecast that house price growth would slow to its lowest pace in four years, to 2% in 2017. However, consumers appeared to be willing to borrow over the short term: Bank of England figures showed consumer credit remaining at elevated levels in April. At \u00a31.5bn, the annual growth rate was broadly unchanged at more than 10% above the same month last year.",

The wine was hailed by judges as \u201cfabulously elegant and refined with \u2026 seductive toasted brioche and honey notes\u201d. The awards were created by the UK wine industry, in association with hotel chain Hotel du Vin, Country Life and Waitrose to celebrate the quality and diversity of British wine. The announcement of the winners was made to coincide with English Wine Week. The industry is one of the fastest growing agricultural sectors in the UK. Over the past 10 years the number of acres planted with grapevines in England and Wales has grown by 135%, according to the English Wine Producers trade body, and English wines are exported to 27 markets overseas. The inaugural gongs attracted 293 entries, with 20 gold, 36 silver and 127 bronze medals awarded to winning wines. The judges were a panel of 12 experts led by broadcaster and writer Susie Barrie. Hampshire-based Coates &amp; Seely took home four of the eight trophies, including the top award. The company was founded in 2009 by Nicholas Coates and Christian Seely and produces an average of 65,000 bottles each year in its winery. It currently exports about 25% of its wines. Earlier this month Norfolk\u2019s Winbirri Vineyards was named the surprise winner of the world\u2019s best value, single variety still white wine in the prestigious Decanter World Wine Awards. A record number of English wine companies were launched last year, new figures revealed earlier this week. Sixty four new wine businesses put down roots in England and Wales during 2016, up 73% on the previous year, according to HM Revenue and Customs.",
