      "bodyText": "The UK has set a new landmark for clean energy after the National Grid announced that the electricity powering the UK\u2019s homes and businesses this summer was the greenest ever. The record comes as the first subsidy-free large solar power project opens in the UK, in what the government described as a significant moment for the energy sector. Analysis by National Grid of power generation showed that a combination of solar, wind and nuclear \u2013 and an absence of coal \u2013 pushed carbon emissions to their lowest level yet over the season. Between 21 June and 22 September, the carbon intensity of the grid \u2013 as measured in grammes of C02 emitted per KWh of power generated \u2013 was more than halved from its level over the same period four years ago. This summer, nearly 52% of power came from low-carbon sources, compared with 35% in 2013. A growing number of solar and windfarms, coupled with nuclear and gas power stations, have transformed summer power supply and broken new records. On one Friday in May, solar panels even briefly provided more power than the UK\u2019s nuclear fleet. Duncan Burt, director of the system operator at National Grid, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a summer of records. The big fundamental shift has been the continuing growth in offshore wind and solar coming on. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from renewables being a part of the mix to often being a significant, majority part of the mix.\u201d He added that while the group would have liked to have seen some windier, sunnier days in August, it had coped with the challenge of managing intermittent power sources such as wind and expected the trend to continue. While National Grid said that handling the amount of variable, renewable power on the system is not adding to consumer costs at the moment, studies have shown a much higher penetration of green energy could result in higher bills. A report by the UK Energy Research Centre earlier this year warned that balancing intermittent wind and solar would increase costs if the grid is not made more flexible with new measures, such as battery storage. National Grid has launched a new forecast of the grid\u2019s carbon intensity, to help householders see the most environmentally friendly time to use appliances such as washing machines, or to charge an electric car. The best times to keep emissions down while making a cup of tea on Tuesday, for instance, are forecast to be at 1am, 2.30pm and 11.30pm. In a further boost for green energy the climate minister, Claire Perry, on Tuesday will officially open a solar farm in Bedfordshire that has been billed as the first subsidy-free one of its kind in the UK. Perry hailed it as \u201ca significant moment for clean energy in the UK\u201d. Installations of large-scale solar farms crashed after the government ended subsidies in the spring of 2016, but the developer of the new facility near Flitwick believes that energy storage has made them financially viable, even without state support. \u201cSolar obviously by itself is still very difficult. What we\u2019re doing is making it into a hybrid site,\u201d said Steve Shine, chairman of Anesco, in reference to the 6MW of batteries that will store electricity generated from the 10MW solar farm during the day, to be sold when the power is most valuable. The farm\u2019s capacity is enough to power the equivalent of about 3,000 homes. Shine said the project would break even due to the batteries and the way the company had cut costs by nearly a third through measures such as not burying cables. \u201cI really do believe this is the future,\u201d said Shine, arguing the combination of solar and batteries could help address the UK\u2019s energy challenges. \u201cWe\u2019re not building new CCGT [gas], coal\u2019s got to come off, nuclear needs a lot of subsidy, offshore wind is obviously good, but solar is lowest life cost.\u201d Separately, a report from Imperial College predicted that the combination of solar power and batteries could be so financially attractive to householders by 2030 that the technologies would \u201cbleed revenues from the utilities sector\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Imagination Technologies have jumped more than 40% after the UK chipmaker announced a takeover by a China-backed private equity firm that was blocked by Donald Trump from buying a US rival over national security concerns. Imagination has agreed to a 182p-a-share takeover by Canyon Bridge, which is based in Palo Alto in California and backed by state-owned Chinese fund Yitai Capital. The deal values the Hertfordshire-based company at \u00a3550m; at its peak in 2012, Imagination had a stock market value of nearly \u00a32bn. Shares in Imagination surged to 172p in early trading on Monday, but remained below the offer price. A fortnight ago, Trump blocked Canyon Bridge\u2019s $1.3bn attempt to buy the US chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor. Canyon Bridge was founded with capital from the Chinese government and has indirect links to Beijing\u2019s space programme. It manages about $1.5bn on behalf of Yitai Capital. Imagination, which designs the graphics processors used in smartphones and other electronic devices, put itself up for sale in June after Apple, its biggest customer and one of its main shareholders, said it would stop using its graphics technology in the iPhone and other new products by 2019. Just over half of Imagination\u2019s 1,200 workforce are based in the UK, with the rest working in Europe, the US, China and India. Its head office and main research and development centre are in Kings Langley near London. The business is run by Andrew Heath, a former Rolls-Royce executive. Imagination said it had talked to a number of potential purchasers, adding that there may be another takeover offer from an second unnamed bidder. The deal agreed with Canyon Bridge excludes Imagination\u2019s US unit MIPS, which is being sold to Tallwood Venture Capital, a Palo Alto-based investment group, for $65m. Canyon Bridge\u2019s deal is conditional on the completion of the MIPS sale. Selling MIPS will avoid subjecting Canyon Bridge\u2019s takeover of Imagination to a review by the committee on foreign investment in the US \u2013 the government panel that blocked the Lattice deal. Imagination is the latest UK tech firm to be sold to an overseas company, after ARM Holdings, Britain\u2019s biggest technology firm, was acquired by Japan\u2019s SoftBank for \u00a324bn last year. Canyon Bridge has pledged to invest in Imagination\u2019s UK research and development. Both companies said there were no plans to cut staff.",

      "bodyText": "Oil prices jumped to their highest for more than two years on Monday after major producers said output cuts were squeezing supplies. Brent crude leapt by 2.7% to $58.39 (\u00a343.35) a barrel as analysts said prices could rise to levels not seen since 2014, in a move that would put further upward pressure on inflation in the UK. The oil price squeeze has been orchestrated by the Opec oil producers\u2019 group but could be exacerbated if Turkey follows through on threats to block supplies from Kurdistan. Improving global growth, especially in emerging economies and the eurozone, is also pushing up oil prices by increasing demand for energy, while the damage to US shale output in the wake of Tropical Storm Harvey could also lift Brent. \u201cIt\u2019s all driven by the idea is that the production cut is starting to work and the rebalance is under way,\u201d said Gene McGillian at US-based consultancy Tradition Energy. The market shift represents a short-term boost for North Sea oil producers after three years of low prices that have triggered steep cuts in employment in the industry\u2019s main centres around Aberdeen and forced many firms out of business. But Britain\u2019s economy is expected to suffer more generally should prices continue to rise towards $60 a barrel. The balance of payments deficit, already the largest in the G7, is expected to widen after years of declining North Sea production turned the UK into a net importer of oil. The higher price of oil is also expected to translate into higher prices at petrol pumps, which could push inflation above 3%. Oil prices tumbled from above $115 a barrel in the summer of 2014 in response to flagging growth in China and much of the world\u2019s developing economies. In January 2016 Brent crude dipped below $30 a barrel. But the situation has improved for producers following a recovery in China and stronger growth across most developed nations in growth. Last week an Opec meeting said that an agreement to cap production was another important factor helping to reduce the global supply glut. Meanwhile Turkey threatened to cut oil flows from Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region in response to its referendum on independence, which Turkey does not recognise. The Iraqi government does not recognise the referendum and has called on foreign countries to stop importing Kurdish crude oil. Opec, which counts Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela among its 14 members, agreed with Russia and several other producers last year to cut production by about 1.8m barrels a day from the start of 2017. On Friday it said the reduction had helped to lift oil prices by about 15% in the past three months.",

      "bodyText": "After the full-employment annus horribilis of 2016, this year the news in 2017 has been overwhelmingly good. Full-time employment is growing stronger than any time in the past six years. But a significant source of growth of full-time work has come from older workers. With the beginning of the retirement age being raised, there are now more people over 65 working full-time than ever before \u2013 and it is likely to be a sign of things to come. The news on the employment front has been almost universally good in the past six months. So strong has been the recent surge in employment that the government is now on track for the first time to reach the goal set by Tony Abbott at the 2013 election of 1 million jobs in five years: In August, employment was growing at an annual rate of by 2.6% \u2013 the best for 18 months \u2013 and, better still, the hours worked is now growing at a rate of 2.7% \u2013 the best since the start of 2011: The growth in hours worked is important because it is a sign that some of the slack is going out of the labour market. While the August figures also showed that underemployment remained at record highs, the better growth of hours worked should hopefully see that come down: The growth of hours worked is also crucial for bringing a return of some normality to wages growth. If workers are worrying about having to choose between a higher wage rate and more hours, the choice for more hours will likely come first but after that a better wage rate should follow (but join a union as well). The strong growth of hours worked also reflects that recently full-time work has been the big driver of jobs: But where are these full-time jobs and who is getting them? The good news is the growth has largely been across all states and both genders. Men accounted for 148,800 of the 253,300 extra full-time employment in the past 12 months, with women making up the other 41% \u2013 an amount slightly above expected, given women account for 36% of all full-time employed. While growth was most consistent in New South Wales and Victoria, Western Australia has also seen a solid increase \u2013 especially among women. But while the eastern states are powering ahead, the situation in WA is more about recovery \u2013 it still has 2% fewer people working full-time than was the case at the end of 2014: When we look at age, however, we see a big change occurring. The past 12 months has seen an amazing increase in the number of people over the age of 65 working full-time. There are 26% more women over 65 working full-time now than a year ago and 16% more men: It is a state of affairs that reflects the finding of the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey The Hilda survey found that people turning 65 were now more likely to put off retirement than in the past. It noted that men born 1935 to 1939 were the most \u201clikely to have retired before age 60\u201d, while those born 1920 to 1929 and 1935 to 1939 were the equal most likely to have retired before age 65. But, by contrast, those born 1950 to 1954 are the least likely to have retired before 60 and those born 1945 to 1949 were the least likely to have retired before 65. It has led to the point where there is a greater proportion of people over the retirement age working full-time now than ever before: Nearly 10% of all men above the retirement age are working full-time \u2013 nearly double the rate at the start of the century. The baby boomers are working longer than any generation before them and it is likely to be the start of an ongoing trend given that July this year saw the start of the increase in the pension age to 65 and a half years of age. It will increase by six months every two years until reaching 67 in July 2023. The Turnbull government still has a policy of raising that to 70 years for those born after 1965. At the other end of the age scale, millennials under 25 are less likely to be working full-time than any of that age ever before: The slower start to full-time work, the greater actual participation rates for women, the increase in the retirement age all mean that while the baby boomers are working longer than ever before, those who will come after them will likely work much longer. In essence what we\u2019re seeing now for over 65s is akin to the changes in the labour force we saw for those in their 20s and 30s in the 1970s and 80s. But we shouldn\u2019t suggest all the full-time work is going to older workers. The biggest share of growth is still that of workers aged 25-64: Even if we exclude the older and youth workers, prime-aged full-time employment is growing stronger than it has for six years. And that is a good sign, one which hopefully will lead to an increase in real wages and households\u2019 standard of living.",

      "bodyText": "European investors appeared to be a little nervous following the result of the German elections. As expected Angela Merkel remains Chancellor, but the better than expected performance by the far right party AfD took some of the shine off her victory. In the UK banks and insurance shares were under pressure as Labour unveiled proposals to cap interest rate payments on credit cards, while the Bank of England said UK banks need to set aside an extra \u00a310bn to cover potential losses on car loans, and credit cards. Meanwhile in the US, a fall in technology stocks Facebook and Apple sent markets lower, as did the comments from North Korea that the US had now declared war on the country. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSe 100 finished down 9.35 points or 0.13% at 7301.29 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.02% to 12,594.81 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.27% lower at 5267.13 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.63% to 22,389.57 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.86% lower at 10,216.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 4.06% to 742.49 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 72 points or 0.33%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Ratings agency Fitch has opined on the German election result: Crude is at its best level for more than two years after producers said output cuts were having an effect, and fears grew that supplies from Kurdistan could be curtailed. Brent has jumped 2.7% to $58.39 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate added 2% to $51.77. On Friday an Opec meeting said that an agreement to cap production was helping to reduce the global supply glut. Meanwhile Turkey threatened to cut oil flows from Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region in response to its referendum on independence, which Turkey does not recognise. With markets slipping back, particularly in the US after the new North Korean comments, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: US stocks underwent a sharp wave of selling as North Korea decided to respond to the weekend\u2019s events by declaring that it viewed Mr Trump\u2019s comments as a \u2018declaration of war\u2019. This looks like a fairly hefty step up in the escalation game, and one that is sure to provoke a US response of some kind. Tech stocks were hit hardest, with the Nasdaq already stumbling thanks to the poor debut of Apple\u2019s new phone models. North Korea is clearly rattled; the bomber flights at the weekend remind Pyongyang of its inherent vulnerability and its clear disadvantages when it comes to high-tech weaponry. The risks of miscalculation have now multiplied alarmingly, and markets may well continue to respond negatively. As for Europe, he said: A day relatively free of big corporate news has meant that the focus is squarely on the euro. In Brussels ECB president Mario Draghi seems to have decided that the time has come for a bit of judicious \u2018talking down\u2019 of the euro. While at the most recent ECB meeting he seemed unperturbed by the euro\u2019s strength, today\u2019s comments show that the rise in the single currency is clearly causing him to lose some sleep. With a nod to inflation weakness, he has suggested reminded everyone not to get too carried away with the idea of tapering, since more easing could still be needed. This is Mr Draghi carefully hedging his bets, but with Germany now somewhat distracted by coalition forming the ECB needs to keep the show on the road. If more QE is the means to achieve this, so be it. So the pound has gained 0.7% against the euro to \u20ac1.1372. Back with the German election, and the results have unnerved Greece whose dependency on Berlin for emergency bailout funds has made it ever more vulnerable to developments elsewhere. Helena Smith reports: The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was among the first to congratulate the German chancellor Angela Merkel on her four-time electoral victory: \u201cA Europe of solidarity and democracy is today more necessary than ever before. Whoever, believes in this, should, despite differences, work together for the deepening and expansion of European values.\u201d More dependent than other EU member states on which way the election went, Greek officials are this morning trying to decode the result. Despite Die Linke, the ruling leftist Syriza party\u2019s official choice, posting its second best election result ever, the unexpectedly strong showing of AfD has sent shudders down the spines of many in a country where the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party is the third biggest political force. The strong showing of the bro-business FDP and the strong likelihood of Merkel entering into coalition with the party, is also causing consternation. It\u2019s leader Christian Linder takes a tough line on debt-stricken Greece\u2019s euro zone membership. \u201cIf there was a debt cut for Greece, as the International Monetary Fund suggests, then we should be open-minded to finally solving the problem,\u201d he said in a recent interview with Bloomberg. \u201cGreece gets a debt cut, the money is gone, but for that Greece has to leave the eurozone, get a new currency of its own which it can devalue and increase its competitiveness in tourism.\u201d Greek politicians worry that Linder will be following up his rhetoric by requesting the post of finance minister in Berlin. Meanwhile Jeroen Dijsselbloem, visiting chairman of the eurogroup ministers represening countries in the single currency, has urged Greece to implement the reforms that will enable it to make a \u201cclean exit\u201d from its third and current bailout program. \u201cThere is a joint interest in getting the third [bailout compliance] review done quickly,\u201d he said during talks with Tsipras. Back in Europe, and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has finished his appearance before parliament. Here is Reuters take on his performance: The European Central Bank is growing increasingly confident that inflation will rise back to its target but patience is still needed, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Monday. Draghi singled out currency volatility as a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring and argued that the economy still needed to absorb slack, requiring \u201cample\u201d ECB accommodation. \u201cOverall, we are becoming more confident that inflation will eventually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, but we also know that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for the upward inflation path to materialize,\u201d Draghi told the European Parliament\u2019s committee on economic affairs. With the euro zone economy now growing for the 17th straight quarter, the ECB is expected to reduce stimulus from next year, even if inflation will remain below the bank\u2019s near 2 percent target for years to come. Indeed, policymakers speaking to Reuters said that the debate is now about the details of the policy shift, such as whether to keep quantitative easing open ended or whether to signal an intent to phase out bond purchases. US markets have extended their falls after comments from North Korea ratcheted up the tensions with the US again: The Dow is now down 0.3%, the S&amp;P 500 is 0.17% lower and the Nasdaq Composite has lost 1%. Gold, as a haven for investors in risky times, has added $2 an ounce to $1299. Elsewhere US markets have slipped at the start of the new week, not helped by a decline in Apple shares on concerns that the new iPhone 8 may not be as popular as hoped and a drop in Facebook stock. The Dow Jones Industrial is down 0.04% in early trading while the S&amp;P 500 is 0.12% lower. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 are fractionally lower today as the lacklustre move in US equities continues. The American indices registered a string of fresh record-highs recently, but we saw the bullish momentum fizzle out at the end of last week. The ground that has been handed back is small when compared with how much they have risen since August. Federal Reserve member, William Dudley, stated he expects a gradual increase in interest rates. Mr Dudley anticipates inflation to tick up in the medium term, as the soft US dollar and robust international growth will help the US economy. Last week, the US central bank made in clear they intend to hike rates in December. Central banks should be listened to, but they don\u2019t always uphold their pledges. Earlier, there was more fuel for the Fed fire with a better than expected manufacturing survey from the Dallas Fed: On the ECB\u2019s future actions: Draghi says it is premature to talk about what may be decided at the October meeting of the ECB. That meeting is in the spotlight for any news on the bank deciding tapering its stimulus programme, but Draghi seems keen not to pre-empt the discussion. A question on regulating bitcoin: Asked about North Korea and the current tensions, Draghi says he mentioned potential downside risks for the economy, and geopolitical concerns are part of that. On to questions. Draghi is asked about China and the prospects of its debt situation affecting the global economy. He says he is confident the Chinese monetary authorities can cope adequately and have started to act. And he said it was a different situation to two years ago, when there was a serious concern about a downturn in the Chinese economy. Now the eurozone is stronger and \u201can unfavourable change in external economic conditions would not have the same negative impact is would have done two years ago.\u201d Draghi concluded with another call for government\u2019s to also take action: While a cyclical adjustment has been taking place, there are still structural issues which impede sustainable economic convergence. In the years to come, a higher degree of sustained convergence and strengthened resilience will be necessary in order to achieve a better-functioning Economic and Monetary Union. This requires, on the one hand, policy actions by national governments aimed at unlocking the productive potential of our economies. On the other hand, further decisive steps are needed to make Economic and Monetary Union\u2019s economic governance truly fit for purpose. Draghi defended the ECB\u2019s policy and its bond buying programme: The package of monetary policy measures that we have phased in sequentially since June 2014 has led to a significant easing in financing conditions. What is very apparent today, and very difficult to dispute, is that this monetary policy impetus is increasingly leading to stronger economic activity, higher incomes and better employment prospects for people in the euro area. One key factor has been our ability to activate non-standard instruments that can transmit additional stimulus to the productive sector. In fact, transmission through the banking system has become increasingly effective since we began adopting credit-easing measures. I am referring here specifically to the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), but a similar case can be made for our targeted longer-term refinancing operations.... Thanks to our corporate bond purchases, firms in the euro area have witnessed significant improvements in their financing conditions when issuing bonds. The European economy still needs the ECB\u2019s stimulus package despite its recent recovery, according to the central bank\u2019s president Mario Draghi, who also expressed concern over the recent volatility of the euro. Speaking to the European parliament (live here), he said: The firm economic recovery still needs to translate more convincingly into stronger inflation dynamics. As I reported already in the past, deflation risks have essentially disappeared. Nevertheless,measures of underlying inflation have picked up only moderately over recent months. Headline inflation, which was 1.5% in August, is expected to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, driven mainly by base effects in the energy component. Afterwards, it is expected to pick up gradually, reaching 1.5% in 2019, according to the ECB staff projections. Overall, we are becoming more confident that inflation will eventually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, but we also know that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for the upward inflation path to materialise. Moreover, we still see some uncertainties with respect to the medium-term inflation outlook. Most notably, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. We therefore need to be patient and persistent. An upward adjustment of headline inflation that is durable and self-sustained requires a further absorption of economic slack. This, in turn, still requires a very ample degree of monetary policy accommodation. With this in mind, we will decide later this year on a re-calibration of our instruments that maintains the degree of monetary support that the euro area economy still needs to complete its transition to a new balanced growth trajectory characterised by sustained conditions of price stability. He did say the economic was now firm and broad-based across eurozone, while \u201cthe latest information indicates continued momentum in the period ahead.\u201d He added: According to the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the economic expansion will continue at growth rates above potential over the projection horizon. Back with yesterday\u2019s German general election, here\u2019s a round-up of the best City reaction. Asset management firm BlackRock say: Merkel wins a fourth term but faces tricky coalition talks after mainstream parties posted their worst results since the 1940s \u00b7 We see the outcome slowing momentum behind a Franco-German drive to promote deeper eurozone integration \u00b7 The powerful position of German finance minister could be key in coalition talks and the future of the eurozone Jeremy Cook of World First reckons the euro has been weakened by AfD\u2019s success in yesterday\u2019s election, saying: Critics are wondering what this means for German domestic politics, and the German economy as a whole. He also suspects the new coalition government probably won\u2019t be assembled until December. Nick Peters, multi asset portfolio manager at Fidelity International, said despite the surprises in the German elections, European shares should benefit from a stronger economic backdrop: Europe\u2019s equity market has lagged other developed markets (excluding the impact of currency) and so offers some potential for catch up, particularly given valuations do not looked stretched relative to recent history and with earnings per share growth the fastest among developed markets. The backdrop also supports the rationale for small cap eurozone equities which should benefit most from the growing expansion of domestic demand and any agreement to cut corporate taxes. Merkel\u2019s governments have promoted German growth mainly through external competitiveness and, although there is a need to re-balance the economy somewhat, it is unlikely the new government will significantly change tact with Markel still Chancellor. This should be positive for export orientated sectors, such as industrials and healthcare, though the auto sector faces some stronger specific challenges that will be important for relative performance. And Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index believes Spain is more of a threat to the euro than Germany. This weekend Catalonia is proposing to hold a referendum on independence, which the Madrid government had stated is illegal: If Catalonia votes for independence, even if the vote is deemed illegal, then it could put pressure on Madrid to allow the people of the region to have a legal vote, which could increase the chance of a break up of Spain. It could also have ramifications for the EU, would an independent Catalonia be allowed to join? Would it spur other nations to seek independence, not only from other countries\u2019 but also from the EU? Overall, referendums in recent years have not been good news for a currency. Back in 2014, when Scotland held its unsuccessful independence referendum, the pound dropped 6% from July to September, before bouncing 2% when the referendum failed, then it resumed its downtrend.... Thus, if the Catalonia referendum goes ahead we expect this to be a disruptive event for the euro, with the potential for a sharp decline of up to 5% initially in the single currency if the separatists win. Back to the Bank of England\u2019s warnings on consumer credit.... ....and Capital Economics have issued a note, pointing out that the BoE isn\u2019t actually forcing banks to tighten their lending. UK economist Ruth Gregory says: In today\u2019s Statement, the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) fired a warning shot to banks over consumer credit, suggesting that banks would need to increase the amount of capital they hold by \u00a310bn in order to protect against losses. But it stopped short of attempting to rein in lending.... Overall, then, today\u2019s action goes further than the red-flag waving we\u2019ve seen from the FPC up until now. But it is unlikely to slow the economy significantly, or delay the first hike in interest rates, which we think will be in November. Uber\u2019s apology (see earlier post) appears to have broken the ice with London\u2019s authorities. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, has just welcomed Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s open letter -- and asked Transport for London to meet with the Uber boss. Khan says: \u201cI welcome the apology from Dara Khosrowshahi, the Uber CEO. Obviously I am pleased that he has acknowledged the issues that Uber faces in London. Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him.\u201d My colleague Nick Hopkins has a cracking scoop - Deloitte, one of the world\u2019s largest accountancy firms, has recently been hacked, exposing emails from some its major clients. Nick writes: One of the world\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firms has been targeted by a sophisticated hack that compromised the confidential emails and plans of some of its blue-chip clients, the Guardian can reveal. Deloitte, which is registered in London and has its global headquarters in New York, was the victim of a cybersecurity attack that went unnoticed for months. One of the largest private firms in the US, which reported a record $37bn (\u00a327.3bn) revenue last year, Deloitte provides auditing, tax consultancy and high-end cybersecurity advice to some of the world\u2019s biggest banks, multinational companies, media enterprises, pharmaceutical firms and government agencies. The Guardian understands Deloitte clients across all of these sectors had material in the company email system that was breached. The companies include household names as well as US government departments. Here\u2019s the full story: Shares in UK banks and insurers have dropped this morning, amid the warning that a recession could create \u00a330bn of consumer credit losses. Virgin Money has shed almost 2%, Barclays are down 1% and Prudential have lost 1.5%, as traders digest this morning\u2019s report from the Bank of England. Jasper Lawler, LCG Head of Research, explains: A downturn in bank and insurance company shares meant a difficult start to the week for the FTSE 100. The Bank of England is sounding the alarm on rising consumer debt levels. Any restriction on lending, particularly unsecured lending like credit cards and car loans would be a direct hit to a big profit centre for banks and insurers. It\u2019s official, Labour are calling on the UK government to change the law so that credit card customers don\u2019t pay more in interest repayments than their original loan (as flagged up at 10.30am). And if they don\u2019t, John McDonnell says he\u2019ll do it when Labour win power. John McDonnell just brought the Labour conference hall to its collective feet, with a pledge to bring Britain\u2019s energy, water, rail, and the Royal Mail back into public ownership and control. No immediate reaction on the stock market, but I\u2019ll keep an eye.... Over at the Labour party conference in Brighton, shadow chancellor John McDonnell is criticising Britain\u2019s \u201crentier economy\u201d. McDonnell is also blasting the City for failing to support high value businesses, and promising a new \u201cStrategic Investment Board\u201d to improve productivity. Plus, extra investment on transport links outside London. Our Politics liveblog has full details: The Bank of England\u2019s warning about consumer credit comes as the City braces for the first UK interest rate rise since 2007. The BoE is widely expected to hike borrowing costs by early next year, quite possibly in at its November meeting. Millions of home owners and borrowers have never seen interest rates go up, thus the concern that the rapid growth in Britain\u2019s consumer credit could end in tears. The Bank of England\u2019s hawkish stance has already hurt speculative investors, such as hedge funds. They have been forced to ditch their bets that the pound would weaken, since the BoE hinted earlier this month that a rate rise was close. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever has tweeted the details: Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s apologetic open letter to London strikes a more conciliatory tone. His promise to change the taxi hire company is a clear sign that Uber could compromise to persuade TfL to reverse last week\u2019s decision, and let it keep operating in the capital. Here\u2019s the key section: \u201cWhile Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it\u2019s equally true that we\u2019ve got things wrong along the way. On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, Iapologise for the mistakes we\u2019ve made. We will appeal the decision on behalf of millions of Londoners, but we do so with the knowledge that we must also change.\u201d In other news, Uber has issued an open letter confirming it will appeal the decision to remove its licence to operate in London. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has apologised for the mistakes made by Uber (he doesn\u2019t specify what, exactly) and promised to listen to its critics. Khosrowshahi has also thanked the hundreds of thousands of people who signed a petition urging Transport for London to reverse the move (which has split opinion in the media and on the streets of the capital). Uber\u2019s communications chief, Alex Belardinelli, has tweeted the letter: TfL ruled last Friday that Uber was not a \u201cfit and proper\u201d private car hire operator, citing concerns over its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and checking the background of its drivers. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, has sent over some tips for consumers to protect themselves from getting overwhelmed by debt. Borrowing as little as possible \u2013 and only ever for a specific reason Checking your credit report is correct before you apply Finding the cheapest way to get the cash you need \u2013 this could be a 0% credit card or a low cost loan If you\u2019re looking for a credit card go to a comparison site to check your chance of acceptance upfront so you can apply with confidence Being clear about what\u2019s affordable for you now as well as if your circumstances change Always having a plan to pay back what you\u2019ve borrowed upfront Treating credit card borrowing like a loan and setting up regular payments to clear it. She addsL \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee statement means more for banks than it does for borrowers right now. It\u2019s the highest financial power telling lenders they need to be careful and set aside an extra \u00a310bn if they want to sail through Brexit unscathed. The Bank of England\u2019s consumer credit warning comes as the opposition Labour party turn up the pressure on lenders. Later today, shadow chancellor John McDonnell is expected to promise more help for people struggling with their debts. Under Labour\u2019s proposals, debt repayments would be capped at twice the original borrowings (similar to existing protection for payday loans). McDonnell is expected to tell the Labour party conference that: \u201cIt means that no one will ever pay more in interest than their original loan. If the Tories refuse to act, I can announce today that the next Labour government will amend the law.\u201d Our City editor Jill Treanor has studied today\u2019s report from the BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, and reports: Britain\u2019s banks could incur \u00a330bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance if interest rates and unemployment rise sharply, the Bank of England warned on Monday. After assessing the fast growth in the consumer credit market, Threadneedle Street is requiring the banking system to hold an extra \u00a310bn of capital as protection against any future losses after finding that lenders are underestimating their exposure to bad debts in an economic downturn. Publishing its latest assessment of risks to the financial system, the Bank of England also spelt out specific concerns about the impact of Brexit on \u00a320tn of derivatives contracts used by companies and financial firms to manage their risks. The UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU also raises questions about whether banks will able to hold consumer data in Britain and poses questions about the ability of insurance companies to make payments to consumers across the union. The Bank of England says that UK consumer credit is growing \u2018rapidly\u2019, at 9.8% in the 12 months to July 2017. It singles out \u201cstrong growth of dealership car finance, credit card debt and other borrowing, such as personal loans\u201d. This chart, from today\u2019s report, shows how car finance has swelled in recent years. This is mainly due to the boom in personal contract purchase deals, which let a consumer pay a small regular payment for a new car and then either buy it or walk away after a few years. Last week, my colleague Richard Partington explained how PCPs are encouraging people into debt. He wrote: There is no suggestion the sales practices are illegal or that any rules have been broken, yet they illustrate a significant shift in the way cars are bought in the UK. Salespeople at three dealerships visited by the Guardian offered vehicles on the road with little or no deposit. One suggested a \u00a31,000 downpayment to secure a 1.5l Mini Cooper, with a top speed of 127mph, which could be refunded when the car was collected from the showroom a few days later. Deposits can even be paid for by credit card, adding to the debt pile...... Britons previously paid cash or took out a loan from a high street bank. Now, they\u2019re increasingly turning to finance packages, with a package known as the personal contract purchase (PCP) among the most popular. One salesman said: \u201cMost people come in here and they\u2019re just thinking \u2018Ah, they\u2019re looking\u2019. And then they tend to walk out with a PCP agreement.\u201d The Bank of England seems to have turned up the volume today: As City AM\u2019s Jasper Jolly puts it: The Bank of England today issued its strongest warning yet on the fast-expanding consumer credit sector, with financial stability experts at Threadneedle Street saying banks may not be adequately prepared for losses. In a nutshell, the Bank of England is concerned that lenders, both in the UK and beyond, aren\u2019t being prudent enough. It fears that reckless borrowing will come back and bite banks, painfully, if the world economy weakens, financial conditions worsen, and borrowers find they\u2019ve overstretched themselves. As the FPC puts it: There are signs in some markets, globally and domestically, of excessive weight being placed on recent benign conditions as an indicator of future risks. This behaviour encourages greater risk taking, potentially building up greater vulnerabilities. The FPC singles out the \u201cpronounced\u201d financial vulnerabilities in China, where corporate borrowing has outpaced economic growth, and \u201ccorporate leverage in the United States\u201d. The Bank of England is also concerned that Brexit poses a risk to UK economic stability. It ha singled out the City of London\u2019s huge market in derivative contracts (such as options to buy or sell financial assets at a certain price in the future. The Financial Policy Committee says: The FPC is considering in particular risks arising from: discontinuity of cross-border contracts, in particular insurance and derivatives; restrictions on sharing of personal data between the European Union and United Kingdom; and restrictions after Brexit on cross-border banking, central clearing and asset management service provision. Newsflash: The Bank of England has issued a fresh warning that consumer credit losses could spiral if the economy weakens. The BoE says UK banks need to set aside an extra \u00a310bn to cover potential losses on car loans, and credit cards. The warning comes from the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, which has just published the conclusions from its latest meeting, last week. In it, the FPC warns that consumer credit looses could hit \u00a330bn (!) if Britain falls into a recession. It reckons that one in five consumer credit loans might have to be written off..... The report says: Within a benign overall domestic credit environment, there is a pocket of risk in the rapid growth of consumer credit. This is not a material risk to economic growth, as consumer credit represents only 11% of overall household debt. It is a risk to banks\u2019 ability to withstand severe economic downturns, because this asset class is disproportionately more likely to default. Although the overall credit quality of consumer credit has improved significantly since the financial crisis, the FPC judges that lenders overall are placing too much weight on the recent performance of consumer lending in benign conditions as an indicator of underlying credit quality. As a result, they have been underestimating the losses they could incur in a downturn. The FPC has responded to this risk by accelerating its analysis of credit losses that banks could incur in the very deep recession encapsulated in the 2017 annual stress test scenario. The FPC and PRC judge that, in the first three years of that severe stress test scenario, the UK banking system would, in aggregate, incur UK consumer credit losses of around \u00a330 billion, or 20% of UK consumer credit loans, representing 150 basis points of the aggregate common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of the UK banking system. This is just one element of the overall stress test and should not be used as a guide to lenders\u2019 overall results, which will be published as planned on 28 November. More to follow.... The fall in business confidence this month is a setback to the German economy, says Carsten Brzeski of ING. He\u2019s telling clients that German firms are suffering from rising geopolitical tensions, Brzeski writes: While Germany is still digesting the results of last night\u2019s elections, the country\u2019s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, weakened for the second month in a row and dropped in September. The Ifo index now stands at 115.2, from 115.9 in August. Both the expectations and current assessment component dropped. While the September drop was probably a result of increased geopolitical tensions, ongoing problems in the German automotive industry and the stronger euro, the next months will tell how the German business sector looks at the results of Sunday\u2019s poll. The drop in German business confidence suggests that Europe\u2019s largest economy is slowing, says IFO. IFO also reckons that a second German election is possible.... Just in: German business confidence has deteriorated unexpectedly this month. The monthly survey of investor morale, from the IFO institute, has dropped to 115.2 from 115.9. Investors had expected it to maintain its recent rally and hit 116.0. IFO found that German firms are less optimistic about current business conditions, and their future prospects. But still, the IFO index is at a pretty solid level: Mehreen Khan of the Financial Times also reckons the German election results are a blow to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s push for a eurozone budget. Here\u2019s a snapshot from her Brussels Briefing: She warns that it could take months to hammer out the \u201cJamaica\u201d coalition. Europe\u2019s major stock markets have all dipped in early trading. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says political concerns are weighing on the markets: The negative European open follow a mixed session in Asia in response to a less convincing Federal election win for German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron struggling in Senate elections - both denting the euro \u2013 coupled with a UK sovereign debt downgrade by Moody\u2019s on Friday, just hours after PM May\u2019s Brexit speech, and aggressive rhetoric from North Korea\u2019s foreign minister at the UN on Saturday. The pound is shaking off Moody\u2019s decision to downgrade Britain\u2019s credit rating last Friday night. Sterling has risen by almost half a cent against the US dollar at $1.3533, despite Moody\u2019s warning that the UK\u2019s \u201cmedium-term economic strength\u201d would be weakened by Brexit - a claim the Treasury have rebutted. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale suggests Moody\u2019s are playing catch-up (any serious trader will have their own views on Brexit too): Beware a short-lived slide, but the longer-term depends on the economy, monetary policy the public finances and all that normal jazz. Ratings agencies can have a temporary impact but they are mostly telling us what we already know and have priced-in long ago. There\u2019s little reaction in the bond market either: Investors are piling into German government debt this morning, at the expense of riskier assets such as Italian bonds. This has pushed the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs to its highest level since early September: We\u2019ve collected the full German election results here. The euro is losing ground in early trading, as traders digest Germany\u2019s election results. The single currency has shed 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.1915. It\u2019s suffering a sharper fall against the pound, down 0.7% at 87.9p. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at Interactive Investor, says investors don\u2019t like the sound of lengthy coalition talks between German parties. \u201cAs predicted, Angela Merkel won a fourth term in office, but not without handing over a chunk of her vote to the Far Right AFD. The SDP did even worse, and the chancellor will be forced into bed with the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP) in a Jamaica coalition. Any extended period of uncertainty poses a problem, certainly if the FDP\u2019s dislike of Macron threatens Germany\u2019s relationship with France. Markets won\u2019t like that. It\u2019s possible that Angela Merkel becomes distracted from international politics during the inevitable horse trading following a disappointing election for her. Any sense that this weakens the EU\u2019s position could play into the hands of UK Brexit negotiators, as a fourth round of talks with European officials begins in Brussels today.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a risk-off feel in the markets this morning after a weekend of political drama, notably in Germany. Angela Merkel\u2019s achievement in winning fourth term as German chancellor is firmly overshadowed by the news that the far-right, anti-immigration AfD party has won seats in the Bundestag. AfD\u2019s shock success has serious implications for Europe and the eurozone. It could force Merkel to take a tougher line on migration, and probably also undermines French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s hopes to create more European integration. Merkel\u2019s likely coalition partners, the FDP, are firmly opposed to the idea of a eurozone budget in which Germany covers some of its neighbours\u2019 bills. Germany wasn\u2019t the only country heading to the polls last weekend. New Zealand also held a general election, which has delivered a stalemate with neither major party securing a majority. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, says: Politics continues to make its mark on markets after the weekend provided news of two more coalition governments. Angela Merkel underperformed expectations of an easy victory and was awarded with the parties\u2019 lowest vote count since 1949, whilst New Zealand is now bracing itself for a fourth consecutive coalition government. Merkel\u2019s underwhelming victory may have seen her cling on to a 4th term, but her job has just become harder. The rise of AFD, which celebrated its highest result of 13.5%, means they have a louder voice and will force Germany to confront anti-immigration and anti-EU issues at home. Rumours that Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe might call a snap general election is also keeping traders on their toes. Plus, there\u2019s the Trump factor \u2013 America\u2019s president spent the weekend extending his controversial travel ban, and attacking NFL football players as the US anthem row deepened. The City would rather see some progress on infrastructure spending and tax reforms. So, Asian markets have mostly fallen overnight. Europe is following suit with the FTSE 100 losing 35 points in early trading. Also coming up today..... Consumer debt will also be under the spotlight, with the Bank of England\u2019s expected to disclose details of its review into credit. The Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee is concerned that some lender are being too reckless. Tim Wallace of the Daily Telegraph has a good take: Britain\u2019s biggest banks are braced for new restrictions on consumer lending as the Bank of England prepares to unveil the results of its review of the booming sector. Credit cards, unsecured loans and car finance deals have all surged in popularity over the past year, leading Mark Carney and his colleagues on the powerful Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to investigate if there are any growing risks in the sector. The Bank is today expected to provide an indication of its analysis of consumer credit risks across the sector.

Speaking to the European parliament <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ep-live/en/committees/video?event=20170925-1500-COMMITTEE-ECON\">(live here</a>), he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The firm economic recovery still needs to translate more convincingly into stronger inflation dynamics. As I reported already in the past, deflation risks have essentially disappeared. Nevertheless,measures of underlying inflation have picked up only moderately over recent months.</p> <p>Headline inflation, which was 1.5% in August, is expected to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, driven mainly by base effects in the energy component. Afterwards, it is expected to pick up gradually, reaching 1.5% in 2019, according to the ECB staff projections.</p> <p>Overall, we are becoming more confident that inflation will eventually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, but we also know that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for the upward inflation path to materialise. Moreover, we still see some uncertainties with respect to the medium-term inflation outlook.</p> <p>Most notably, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.<br></p> <p>We therefore need to be patient and persistent. An upward adjustment of headline inflation that is durable and self-sustained requires a further absorption of economic slack. This, in turn, still requires a very ample degree of monetary policy accommodation. </p> <p>With this in mind, we will decide later this year on a re-calibration of our instruments that maintains the degree of monetary support that the euro area economy still needs to complete its transition to a new balanced growth trajectory characterised by sustained conditions of price stability.</p> </blockquote> <p>He did say the economic was now firm and broad-based across eurozone, while \u201cthe latest information indicates continued momentum in the period ahead.\u201d He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the economic expansion will continue at growth rates above potential over the projection horizon.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T15:26:42.066Z\">at 4.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59c8b513e4b024b286a9acbe\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T13:17:25.030Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German elections: What the experts say.</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back with yesterday\u2019s German general election, here\u2019s a round-up of the best City reaction.</strong></p> <p>Asset management firm <strong>BlackRock</strong> say:</p> <ul> <li> Merkel wins a fourth term but faces tricky coalition talks after mainstream parties posted their worst results since the 1940s<br></li> <li>\u00b7 We see the outcome slowing momentum behind a Franco-German drive to promote deeper eurozone integration<br></li> <li>\u00b7 The powerful position of German finance minister could be key in coalition talks and the future of the eurozone</li> </ul> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook</strong> of<strong> World Firs</strong>t reckons the euro has been weakened by AfD\u2019s success in yesterday\u2019s election, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Critics are wondering what this means for German domestic politics, and the German economy as a whole. </p> </blockquote> <p>He also suspects the new coalition government probably won\u2019t be assembled until December.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/912222008410300417\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Euro slips as German far right upset the apfel cart - WorldFirst Morning Update September 25th - <a href=\"https://t.co/4WVmFDyuHi\">https://t.co/4WVmFDyuHi</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rksN4Mhrp6\">pic.twitter.com/rksN4Mhrp6</a></p>&mdash; World First (@World_First) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/912222008410300417\">September 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Nick Peters, </strong>multi asset portfolio manager at<strong> Fidelity International</strong>, said despite the surprises in the German elections, European shares should benefit from a stronger economic backdrop:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Europe\u2019s equity market has lagged other developed markets (excluding the impact of currency) and so offers some potential for catch up, particularly given valuations do not looked stretched relative to recent history and with earnings per share growth the fastest among developed markets. The backdrop also supports the rationale for small cap eurozone equities which should benefit most from the growing expansion of domestic demand and any agreement to cut corporate taxes.</p> <p>Merkel\u2019s governments have promoted German growth mainly through external competitiveness and, although there is a need to re-balance the economy somewhat, it is unlikely the new government will significantly change tact with Markel still Chancellor. This should be positive for export orientated sectors, such as industrials and healthcare, though the auto sector faces some stronger specific challenges that will be important for relative performance.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Kathleen Brooks, </strong>research director at<strong> City Index </strong>believes Spain is more of a threat to the euro than Germany. This weekend Catalonia is proposing to hold a referendum on independence, which the Madrid government had stated is illegal: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If Catalonia votes for independence, even if the vote is deemed illegal, then it could put pressure on Madrid to allow the people of the region to have a legal vote, which could increase the chance of a break up of Spain.</p> <p>It could also have ramifications for the EU, would an independent Catalonia be allowed to join? Would it spur other nations to seek independence, not only from other countries\u2019 but also from the EU?</p> <p> Overall, referendums in recent years have not been good news for a currency. Back in 2014, when Scotland held its unsuccessful independence referendum, the pound dropped 6% from July to September, before bouncing 2% when the referendum failed, then it resumed its downtrend.... Thus, if the Catalonia referendum goes ahead we expect this to be a disruptive event for the euro, with the potential for a sharp decline of up to 5% initially in the single currency if the separatists win. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59c8fb65e4b0ff24dc215ded\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T12:58:24.338Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/25/political-worries-markets-bank-of-england-consumer-credit-business-live?page=with:block-59c8bffce4b0ff24dc215ccf#block-59c8bffce4b0ff24dc215ccf\">the Bank of England\u2019s warnings on consumer credit</a>....</strong></p> <p>....and Capital Economics have issued a note, pointing out that t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/25/political-worries-markets-bank-of-england-consumer-credit-business-live?page=with:block-59c8bffce4b0ff24dc215ccf#block-59c8bffce4b0ff24dc215ccf\">he BoE isn\u2019t actually forcing banks to tighten their lending</a>.</p> <p>UK economist Ruth Gregory says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In today\u2019s Statement, the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) fired a warning shot to banks over consumer credit, suggesting that banks would need to increase the amount of capital they hold by \u00a310bn in order to protect against losses.

It reckons that one in five consumer credit loans might have to be written off.....<br></p> <p>The report says:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Within a benign overall domestic credit environment, there is a pocket of risk in the rapid growth of consumer credit.</strong> This is not a material risk to economic growth, as consumer credit represents only 11% of overall household debt. It is a risk to banks\u2019 ability to withstand severe economic downturns, because this asset class is disproportionately more likely to default. Although the overall credit quality of consumer credit has improved significantly since the financial crisis, the FPC judges that lenders overall are placing too much weight on the recent performance of consumer lending in benign conditions as an indicator of underlying credit quality. As a result, they have been underestimating the losses they could incur in a downturn. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The FPC has responded to this risk by accelerating its analysis of credit losses that banks could incur in the very deep recession encapsulated in the 2017 annual stress test scenario.</strong> The FPC and PRC judge that, in the first three years of that severe stress test scenario, the UK banking system would, in aggregate, incur UK consumer credit losses of around \u00a330 billion, or 20% of UK consumer credit loans, representing 150 basis points of the aggregate common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of the UK banking system. This is just one element of the overall stress test and should not be used as a guide to lenders\u2019 overall results, which will be published as planned on 28 November. </li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/912233509263159296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bank of England tells lenders they will need \u00a310bn of capital to withstand potential consumer credit losses</p>&mdash; Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/912233509263159296\">September 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong><em>More to follow....</em></strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T08:41:44.071Z\">at 9.41am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59c8bec6e4b0c2f349fe3d49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T08:36:06.036Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/25/political-worries-markets-bank-of-england-consumer-credit-business-live?page=with:block-59c8b8c5e4b0ff24dc215cb4#block-59c8b8c5e4b0ff24dc215cb4\">The fall in business confidence this month</a> is a setback to the German economy, says Carsten Brzeski of ING.</strong></p> <p>He\u2019s telling clients that German firms are suffering from rising geopolitical tensions, </p> <p>Brzeski writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While Germany is still digesting the results of last night\u2019s elections, the country\u2019s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, weakened for the second month in a row and dropped in September.</p> <p>The Ifo index now stands at 115.2, from 115.9 in August.

      "bodyText": "Uber\u2019s chief executive has apologised for the taxi app\u2019s mistakes in London and promised to change as the company fights a decision by the city not to renew its licence. The firm is battling to keep operating in the capital after Transport for London decided not to renew its licence to operate. Uber\u2019s London licence expires on 30 September, although it will continue to run taxis while it pursues a legal appeal process that could last a year. TfL said last week Uber was not a \u201cfit and proper\u201d private car-hire operator and cited four areas of concern, including its approach to reporting criminal offences and carrying out background checks on drivers. But sources close to TfL indicated that a change of conduct from the taxi firm, the culture of which is being reformed by its new chief executive, could leave the door open to a fresh licence application. Dara Khosrowshahi, who succeeded Uber founder Travis Kalanick as CEO a month ago, wrote in an open letter: \u201cWhile Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it\u2019s equally true that we\u2019ve got things wrong along the way. On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we\u2019ve made. \u201cWe will appeal [against] the decision on behalf of millions of Londoners, but we do so with the knowledge that we must also change.\u201d Sadiq Khan, the London mayor and chair of TfL, said he welcomed Khosrowshahi\u2019s apology. \u201cObviously I am pleased that he has acknowledged the issues that Uber faces in London,\u201d Khan said. \u201cEven though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him.\u201d However, another Uber executive told the BBC on Monday he company did not understand the concerns of London\u2019s transport regulator. Fred Jones, an executive at Uber\u2019s UK operation, said: \u201cSitting down with TfL representatives as soon as possible would be the most helpful thing to really understand their concerns, to work out what they are. It is just not clear to us what those concerns are.\u201d When asked why Uber does not report criminal offences directly to the police and instead notifies TfL, which lengthens the investigative process, Jones said: \u201cWe follow the rules.\u201d Referring to one specific incident involving an Uber driver who sexually assaulted a passenger, he said: \u201cWe hold our hands up, we made a mistake. In that incident we just didn\u2019t realise when that passenger wrote in how serious it was ... We apologise to everyone involved.\u201d The Uber driver involved stayed on the company\u2019s books and went on to commit another, more serious, attack. Jones defended Uber\u2019s usual practice of notifying TfL of criminal offences. \u201cAs soon as we receive a serious complaint or we are alerted of it, we restrict the access to the app and immediately investigate and that would involve notifying TfL.\u201d He added that Uber had set up a working group. \u201cThis is absolutely something we will work on with the police. This is absolutely an area where we want to go further.\u201d Khan said Uber had brought \u201cunfair pressure\u201d on TfL, employing an \u201carmy\u201d of PR experts and lawyers. The mayor said: \u201cI want companies that abide by the rules, I want companies that innovate, harbour new technologies, I want disruptive technology coming to London but you\u2019ve got to play by the rules.\u201d In a separate dispute, Uber will on Wednesday challenge a tribunal ruling over the employment status of its drivers, which lawyers say is also a public safety issue. Uber is attempting to overturn a landmark ruling that its drivers are workers, with rights to paid holiday and the minimum wage. Lawyers representing the original claimants, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, said Uber was deliberately \u201ckicking the can down the road\u201d and had so far ignored the ruling from October last year. Paul Jennings, of Bates Wells Braithwate, said: \u201cAt the heart of this is safety. Imagine if it was bus or train drivers who couldn\u2019t take a paid holiday. Given the numbers involved and the nature of this work, there is a real risk.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Deloitte hit by cyber-attack revealing clients\u2019 secret emails", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the world\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firms has been targeted by a sophisticated hack that compromised the confidential emails and plans of some of its blue-chip clients, the Guardian can reveal. Deloitte, which is registered in London and has its global headquarters in New York, was the victim of a cybersecurity attack that went unnoticed for months. One of the largest private firms in the US, which reported a record $37bn (\u00a327.3bn) revenue last year, Deloitte provides auditing, tax consultancy and high-end cybersecurity advice to some of the world\u2019s biggest banks, multinational companies, media enterprises, pharmaceutical firms and government agencies. The Guardian understands Deloitte clients across all of these sectors had material in the company email system that was breached. The companies include household names as well as US government departments. So far, six of Deloitte\u2019s clients have been told their information was \u201cimpacted\u201d by the hack. Deloitte\u2019s internal review into the incident is ongoing. The Guardian understands Deloitte discovered the hack in March this year, but it is believed the attackers may have had access to its systems since October or November 2016. The hacker compromised the firm\u2019s global email server through an \u201cadministrator\u2019s account\u201d that, in theory, gave them privileged, unrestricted \u201caccess to all areas\u201d. The account required only a single password and did not have \u201ctwo-step\u201c verification, sources said. Emails to and from Deloitte\u2019s 244,000 staff were stored in the Azure cloud service, which was provided by Microsoft. This is Microsoft\u2019s equivalent to Amazon Web Service and Google\u2019s Cloud Platform. In addition to emails, the Guardian understands the hackers had potential access to usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information. Some emails had attachments with sensitive security and design details. The breach is believed to have been US-focused and was regarded as so sensitive that only a handful of Deloitte\u2019s most senior partners and lawyers were informed. The Guardian has been told the internal inquiry into how this happened has been codenamed \u201cWindham\u201d. It has involved specialists trying to map out exactly where the hackers went by analysing the electronic trail of the searches that were made. The team investigating the hack is understood to have been working out of the firm\u2019s offices in Rosslyn, Virginia, where analysts have been reviewing potentially compromised documents for six months. It has yet to establish whether a lone wolf, business rivals or state-sponsored hackers were responsible. Sources said if the hackers had been unable to cover their tracks, it should be possible to see where they went and what they compromised by regenerating their queries. This kind of reverse-engineering is not foolproof, however. A measure of Deloitte\u2019s concern came on 27 April when it hired the US law firm Hogan Lovells on \u201cspecial assignment\u201d to review what it called \u201ca possible cybersecurity incident\u201d. The Washington-based firm has been retained to provide \u201clegal advice and assistance to Deloitte LLP, the Deloitte Central Entities and other Deloitte Entities\u201d about the potential fallout from the hack. Responding to questions from the Guardian, Deloitte confirmed it had been the victim of a hack but insisted only a small number of its clients had been \u201cimpacted\u201d. It would not be drawn on how many of its clients had data made potentially vulnerable by the breach. The Guardian was told an estimated 5m emails were in the \u201dcloud\u201d and could have been been accessed by the hackers. Deloitte said the number of emails that were at risk was a fraction of this number but declined to elaborate. \u201cIn response to a cyber incident, Deloitte implemented its comprehensive security protocol and began an intensive and thorough review including mobilising a team of cybersecurity and confidentiality experts inside and outside of Deloitte,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cAs part of the review, Deloitte has been in contact with the very few clients impacted and notified governmental authorities and regulators. \u201cThe review has enabled us to understand what information was at risk and what the hacker actually did, and demonstrated that no disruption has occurred to client businesses, to Deloitte\u2019s ability to continue to serve clients, or to consumers. \u201cWe remain deeply committed to ensuring that our cybersecurity defences are best in class, to investing heavily in protecting confidential information and to continually reviewing and enhancing cybersecurity. We will continue to evaluate this matter and take additional steps as required. \u201cOur review enabled us to determine what the hacker did and what information was at risk as a result. That amount is a very small fraction of the amount that has been suggested.\u201d Deloitte declined to say which government authorities and regulators it had informed, or when, or whether it had contacted law enforcement agencies. Though all major companies are targeted by hackers, the breach is a deep embarrassment for Deloitte, which offers potential clients advice on how to manage the risks posed by sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. \u201cCyber risk is more than a technology or security issue, it is a business risk,\u201d Deloitte tells potential customers on its website. \u201cWhile today\u2019s fast-paced innovation enables strategic advantage, it also exposes businesses to potential cyber-attack. Embedding best practice cyber behaviours help our clients to minimise the impact on business.\u201d Deloitte has a \u201cCyberIntelligence Centre\u201d to provide clients with \u201cround-the-clock business focussed operational security\u201d. \u201cWe monitor and assess the threats specific to your organisation, enabling you to swiftly and effectively mitigate risk and strengthen your cyber resilience,\u201d its website says. \u201cGoing beyond the technical feeds, our professionals are able to contextualise the relevant threats, helping determine the risk to your business, your customers and your stakeholders.\u201d In 2012, Deloitte, which has offices all over the world, was ranked the best cybersecurity consultant in the world. Earlier this month, Equifax, the US credit monitoring agency, admitted the personal data of 143 million US customers had been accessed or stolen in a massive hack in May. It has also revealed it was also the victim of an earlier breach in March. About 400,000 people in the UK may have had their information stolen following the cybersecurity breach. The US company said an investigation had revealed that a file containing UK consumer information \u201cmay potentially have been accessed\u201d. The data includes names, dates of birth, email addresses and telephone numbers, but does not contain postal addresses, passwords or financial information. Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, discovered the hack in July but only informed consumers last week.",

      "body": "<p>One of the world\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firms has been targeted by a sophisticated hack that compromised the confidential emails and plans of some of its blue-chip clients, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>Deloitte, which is registered in London and has its global headquarters in New York, was the victim of a cybersecurity attack that went unnoticed for months.</p> <p>One of the largest private firms in the US, which reported a record $37bn (\u00a327.3bn) revenue last year, Deloitte provides auditing, tax consultancy and high-end cybersecurity advice to some of the world\u2019s biggest banks, multinational companies, media enterprises, pharmaceutical firms and government agencies.</p> <p>The Guardian understands Deloitte clients across all of these sectors had material in the company email system that was breached. The companies include household names as well as US government departments.</p> <p>So far, six of Deloitte\u2019s clients have been told their information was \u201cimpacted\u201d by the hack. Deloitte\u2019s internal review into the incident is ongoing. </p> <p>The Guardian understands Deloitte discovered the hack in March this year, but it is believed the attackers may have had access to its systems since October or November 2016.</p> <p>The hacker compromised the firm\u2019s global email server through an \u201cadministrator\u2019s account\u201d that, in theory, gave them privileged, unrestricted \u201caccess to all areas\u201d.</p> <p>The account required only a single password and did not have \u201ctwo-step\u201c verification, sources said.</p> <p>Emails to and from Deloitte\u2019s 244,000 staff were stored in the Azure cloud service, which was provided by Microsoft. This is Microsoft\u2019s equivalent to Amazon Web Service and Google\u2019s Cloud Platform.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f465c2b83791695c97c35124514e5e501cdff919\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f465c2b83791695c97c35124514e5e501cdff919/13_0_572_343/500.png\" alt=\"Microsoft's Azure cloud service.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition to emails, the Guardian understands the hackers had potential access to usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information. Some emails had attachments with sensitive security and design details.</p> <p>The breach is believed to have been US-focused and was regarded as so sensitive that only a handful of Deloitte\u2019s most senior partners and lawyers were informed.</p> <p> The Guardian has been told the internal inquiry into how this happened has been codenamed \u201cWindham\u201d. It has involved specialists trying to map out exactly where the hackers went by analysing the electronic trail of the searches that were made.</p> <p>The team investigating the hack is understood to have been working out of the firm\u2019s offices in Rosslyn, Virginia, where analysts have been reviewing potentially compromised documents for six months.</p> <p>It has yet to establish whether a lone wolf, business rivals or state-sponsored hackers were responsible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/ng-interactive/2017/mar/17/contact-the-guardian-securely\">Contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sources said if the hackers had been unable to cover their tracks, it should be possible to see where they went and what they compromised by regenerating their queries. This kind of reverse-engineering is not foolproof, however.</p> <p>A measure of Deloitte\u2019s concern came on 27 April when it hired the US law firm Hogan Lovells on \u201cspecial assignment\u201d to review what it called \u201ca possible cybersecurity incident\u201d.</p> <p>The Washington-based firm has been retained to provide \u201clegal advice and assistance to Deloitte LLP, the Deloitte Central Entities and other Deloitte Entities\u201d about the potential fallout from the hack.</p> <p>Responding to questions from the Guardian, Deloitte confirmed it had been the victim of a hack but insisted only a small number of its clients had been \u201cimpacted\u201d. It would not be drawn on how many of its clients had data made potentially vulnerable by the breach.</p> <p>The Guardian was told an estimated 5m emails were in the \u201dcloud\u201d and could have been been accessed by the hackers. Deloitte said the number of emails that were at risk was a fraction of this number but declined to elaborate.</p> <p>\u201cIn response to a cyber incident, Deloitte implemented its comprehensive security protocol and began an intensive and thorough review including mobilising a team of cybersecurity and confidentiality experts inside and outside of Deloitte,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> <p>\u201cAs part of the review, Deloitte has been in contact with the very few clients impacted and notified governmental authorities and regulators. </p> <p>\u201cThe review has enabled us to understand what information was at risk and what the hacker actually did, and demonstrated that no disruption has occurred to client businesses, to Deloitte\u2019s ability to continue to serve clients, or to consumers.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe remain deeply committed to ensuring that our cybersecurity defences are best in class, to investing heavily in protecting confidential information and to continually reviewing and enhancing cybersecurity. We will continue to evaluate this matter and take additional steps as required.</p> <p>\u201cOur review enabled us to determine what the hacker did and what information was at risk as a result. That amount is a very small fraction of the amount that has been suggested.\u201d</p> <p>Deloitte declined to say which government authorities and regulators it had informed, or when, or whether it had contacted law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>Though all major companies are targeted by hackers, the breach is a deep embarrassment for Deloitte, which offers potential clients advice on how to manage the risks posed by sophisticated cybersecurity attacks.</p> <p>\u201cCyber risk is more than a technology or security issue, it is a business risk,\u201d Deloitte tells potential customers on its website.</p> <p>\u201cWhile today\u2019s fast-paced innovation enables strategic advantage, it also exposes businesses to potential cyber-attack. Embedding best practice cyber behaviours help our clients to minimise the impact on business.\u201d</p> <p>Deloitte has a \u201cCyberIntelligence Centre\u201d to provide clients with \u201cround-the-clock business focussed operational security\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe monitor and assess the threats specific to your organisation, enabling you to swiftly and effectively mitigate risk and strengthen your cyber resilience,\u201d its website says. \u201cGoing beyond the technical feeds, our professionals are able to contextualise the relevant threats, helping determine the risk to your business, your customers and your stakeholders.\u201d</p> <p>In 2012, Deloitte, which has offices all over the world, <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/security-consulting-ranked-1-revenue-gartner.html\">was ranked the best cybersecurity consultant in the world</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Equifax, the US credit monitoring agency, admitted the personal data of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/07/equifax-credit-breach-hack-social-security\">143 million US customers</a> had been accessed or stolen in a massive hack in May.

The US company said an investigation had revealed that a file containing UK consumer information \u201cmay potentially have been accessed\u201d.</p> <p>The data includes names, dates of birth, email addresses and telephone numbers, but does not contain postal addresses, passwords or financial information.

    "webTitle": "Bank of England warns a consumer debt crisis could cost banks \u00a330bn", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has issued its strongest warning yet about the UK\u2019s ballooning consumer debt, saying Britain\u2019s banks could incur \u00a330bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance if interest rates and unemployment rose sharply. After assessing the fast growth in the consumer credit market, Threadneedle Street is requiring the banking system to hold an extra \u00a310bn of capital as protection against any future losses after finding that lenders are underestimating their exposure to bad debts in an economic downturn. Publishing its latest assessment of risks to the financial system, the Bank also spelled out specific concerns about the impact of Brexit on \u00a320tn of derivatives contracts used by companies and financial firms to manage their risks. The UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU also raises questions about whether banks will be able to hold consumer data in Britain and the ability of insurance companies to make payments to consumers across the bloc. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) \u2013 set up to look for risks to the financial system in the wake of the 2008 crisis \u2013 is requiring more capital to be held after being concerned of a \u201cpocket of risk in the rapid growth of consumer credit\u201d. It follows a warning in July by Alex Brazier, the Bank\u2019s executive director of financial stability, of a \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d about a consumer credit market that was growing at 10% a year when household income had grown only 1.5%. The Bank had already told lenders to start amassing \u00a311.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months to protect against the rise in consumer debt. But it is now requiring them to hold another \u00a310bn of capital after bringing forward stress tests of the UK\u2019s lenders based on hypothetical scenarios of interest rates rising to 4% and unemployment reaching 9.5%. This found they would incur losses of \u00a330bn over three years \u2013 about 20% of their consumer lending \u2013 and \u00a310bn more than might have been expected after last year\u2019s stress tests when Barclays and Lloyds incurred the largest losses from such lending. Shares in banks were knocked and Jasper Lawler, head of research at financial group LCG, said profits could be hit by the Bank sounding the alarm on rising debt levels. \u201cAny restriction on lending, particularly unsecured lending like credit cards and car loans would be a direct hit to a big profit centre for banks and insurers,\u201d said Lawler. Each lender will be told how much they are affected at the time of the annual stress tests in November while the smaller lenders \u2013 such as Virgin Money and Co-op Bank \u2013 which do not participate in the tests will also be assessed. \u201cToday\u2019s action goes further than the red-flag waving we\u2019ve seen from the FPC up until now,\u201d said Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics. But, she said it was unlikely to slow the economy or prevent interest rates being raised from their 0.25% historic low in November. While the Bank is not concerned that consumer debt will be a risk to economic growth as it is only 11% of household debt, it is a risk to lenders\u2019 ability to withstand losses in a downturn as these loans are less likely to be repaid when consumers lose their jobs or face higher interest rates. But the charity StepChange said more needed to be done to help \u201cmillions of households trapped in spiralling persistent debt\u201d. \u201cAction is needed to stop products like credit cards and overdrafts walking people into difficulty, and lenders must do more to help people safely manage their way out of persistent debt,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Connor, chief executive of StepChange. Labour has proposed a cap on credit card rates, meaning people would not have to pay back more than twice the amount of their credit card borrowings, to try to help those customers with long-standing debts. With the \u00a330bn of potential losses, credit cards would be most severely affected with a 25% default rate, with 15% for personal loans and 10% on car finance. Requiring lenders to hold more capital against consumer credit could lead to them pushing up interest rates or being more selective about their lending to cover their additional costs. Hannah Maundrell, editor-in-chief of financial website Money.co.uk, said the initial impact would be on lenders rather on borrowers. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest financial power telling lenders they need to be careful and set aside an extra \u00a310bn if they want to sail through Brexit unscathed,\u201d she said. The Bank\u2019s risk assessment also considers the impact of a hard Brexit \u2013 one with no deal when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 \u2013 on the way that derivatives contracts are handled by the City and concludes tens of thousands of deals could be affected. This is a quarter of all contracts, for instance to protect against interest rates or oil prices increasing, that are not passed through clearing houses. For large dealers between 2,000 and 4,000 of their counterparties would need to be contacted to change the terms of contracts. The Bank warned \u201cthere are no precedents\u201d for these types of changes to take place within the 18 months left before Brexit. Legislation could be needed to allow existing contracts to remain as they are \u2013 a process known as \u201cgrandfathering\u201d \u2013 and only new ones are affected by the changes that are taking place. The Bank \u2013 which has seen each firm\u2019s Brexit plans \u2013 said they also lack \u201crobust contingency plans\u201d to tackle changes to the way that they will be able to store consumer data in the UK after March 2019. \u201cMany firms currently rely on data centres located in the United Kingdom to provide financial services across Europe,\u201d the Bank said.",

The grocery chain reported a 17% fall in profits to \u00a3211.3m in the year to 31 December 2016, from \u00a3255.6m the year before, despite a 13.5% leap in sales to \u00a38.74bn. The company said half its fall in operating margin had been the result of keeping prices low or cutting them, the rest came from investing in new stores and distribution centres as it geared up for future growth. Matthew Barnes, chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: \u201cSince 1990 when we arrived in the UK our approach has been based on the long game, not short-term profit.\u201d He said sales at established stores had risen strongly and \u201creaccelerated\u201d this year, partly as a result of investment to keep prices down, though he would not give a figure. Barnes said Aldi would do \u201ceverything and anything\u201d to keep its prices lower than bigger rivals, indicating that profits might fall again next year. \u201cWe will never take our eye off the ball on price. We see that as our contract with our customers,\u201d he said. Aldi claims to be 15.2% cheaper than Asda, its nearest mainstream competitor, making it the cheapest chain in the UK. Barnes would not comment on how Aldi compared with its German discount rival Lidl. But Aldi has also been forced to slim its margins to maintain its lead after Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s cut prices on basic groceries. Inflation in costs since the fall of the pound against the euro and the dollar after last year\u2019s Brexit vote has also affected costs. Aldi has experienced rapid growth in the UK, overtaking the Co-op this year to become the fifth largest chain. The group said it wanted to open 70 stores next year, the same number as 2017, as part of its plan for 1,000 outlets by 2022. Aldi has 726 stores in the UK. \u201cAs others are scaling back we are are most definitely scaling up,\u201d Barnes said. More than 1 million shoppers had switched to the discounter, helping to double its sales and market share in less than four years, Aldi claimed. Barnes said Aldi had universal appeal as shoppers of all ages and demographics were increasingly choosing its supermarkets. \u201cOur growth is accelerating, thanks to the hundreds of thousands of new customers switching their shop to Aldi,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is happening right across the UK and it is all down to a simple, straightforward commitment \u2013 products comparable to the leading brands and supermarket premium ranges at the lowest prices in Britain.\u201d He said the supermarket was responding to shoppers\u2019 demands by increasing its number of items on sale to 1,800 from 1,500, including new products such as Manuka honey and \u201ccourgetti\u201d (courgette spaghetti) as well as more premium lines for Christmas. Aldi\u2019s best-performing categories over the past year included its Specially Selected range, sales of which rose 40%; fresh fruit, veg, fish and meat also increased strongly. The retailer\u2019s online wine and non-food business increased sales by 90% after launching last year, selling 2m bottles of wine.",
