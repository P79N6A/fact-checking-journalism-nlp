      "bodyText": "More than \u00a3140m has been wiped off the value of the fashion retailer Ted Baker after it warned that challenging trading conditions had been compounded by the recent heavy snows. The shares tumbled 13% on Thursday after its chief executive, Ray Kelvin, said that wintry weather had deterred shoppers from updating their wardrobes both here and in the US. \u201cThe recent unseasonal weather across Europe and the east coast of America has had an impact on the early part of trading for spring/summer,\u201d said Kelvin. \u201cWe anticipate that external trading conditions will remain challenging across many of our global markets.\u201d His gloomy prognosis came despite a successful year when both sales and profits grew strongly. Pre-tax profits rose 12% to \u00a369m, while sales were up more than 11% at \u00a3592m. Kelvin\u2019s cautious outlook added to the gloom in the retail sector after a series of updates from major retailers on Wednesday had pointed to a level of distress and weak consumer confidence not seen since the financial crisis a decade ago. Moss Bros issued a stark profit warning while the landlords of the fashion chain New Look approved a plan that will see it axe 980 jobs and close 60 stores via a so-called company voluntary arrangement (CVA). It also emerged that Carpetright is also seeking a CVA as it looks to shed up to a quarter of its 409 UK stores. Mothercare, the struggling parent and baby retailer that is in talks with its banks, said it had been given more time to secure extra funding. The failure of Maplin and Toys R Us last month had already dealt a severe blow to high street confidence as together the chains ran more than 300 stores and employed 5,500 staff. On Thursday PwC, which is overseeing the Maplin administration, made a further 66 redundancies at its head offices in London and Rotherham, bringing the total number of job losses at the chain to 129. \u201cWhile the latest news of struggles at Moss Bros, New Look, Mothercare and Carpetright has further ignited concerns over the state of retail in the UK, Ted Baker\u2019s latest results provide a glimmer of hope as the premium lifestyle brand continues to build on its successes,\u201d said Charlotte Pearce, an analyst at GlobalData. She added: \u201cBy generating a decent proportion of sales from international markets, Ted Baker will be more protected considering the tough UK retail climate.\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Global markets hit as Trump unveils China tariffs;  Bank leaves rates on hold - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European markets have closed sharply lower, although off their worst levels, as a combination of factors unnerved investors once more. In an echo of the early February slump, share prices around the globe came under pressure. The chief reason was the growing fear of a trade war as President Trump slapped tariffs on China - although more details about the exact targets will come later - in retaliation for supposedly stealing US technology. With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates on Wednesday and the Bank of England signalling a UK increase in May, investors were also rattled by the prospect of the cheap money which has supported markets for years now being more quickly withdrawn. On top of all that, the controversy over Facebook and Cambridge Analytica prompted talk of increased regulation of technology companies. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 1.23% or 86.38 points to 6952.59, a new 15 month low Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.7% to 12,100.08 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.38% at 5167.21 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 1.85% at 22,397.84 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.49% lower at 9487.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.57% to 787.50 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 272 points or 1.11%, having lost more than 500 points earlier. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s more on the exemptions to the US steel and aluminium tariff move: The US move to impose sanctions on China is a high risk strategy, says Mike Jakeman, global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: This has been clearly signposted by the Trump administration and is actually likely to prove broadly popular with US businesses and in Congress. The Democratic minority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, welcomed it as a sign of the US standing up to China. But there is a lot riding on China\u2019s response. The US is gambling that any response will be proportionate. China could hit the US hard in return, by making access to the local market harder for US farmers, for example. Were farmers faced with falling prices for the exports and higher prices at home because of the import tariffs, the popularity of the tariffs would diminish quickly. This is a high-risk strategy for the US administration and one that is likely to weaken, rather than strengthen, the global economy. And here\u2019s Trump\u2019s signed tariff sanctions against China: President Trump is signing the order to impose tariffs on China, which he says could be up to $60bn. He says he has been talking to senior Chinese representatives and asked them to cut the deficit by $100bn immediately. He says he wants reciprical deals. \u201cIf they charge us, we charge them the same thing.\u201d He says China charges 25% for a US car go in,\u201dbut we charge 2% for their cars to come into the US - that\u2019s not good.\u201d He says he has been talking to China, Japan, Europe, and every single one of them wants to negotiate. \u201cIn meantime we are sending a section 301 action which I will sign here.\u201d The proposed tariffs on China are expected shortly. AP sums up the situation: The Trump administration is readying restrictions on Chinese investment and tariffs on nearly $50 billion worth of Chinese imports to punish Beijing for stealing American technology and pressuring U.S. companies to hand it over. China is already warning that it will take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to defend itself, raising the prospect of a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. The White House says President Donald Trump will direct the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to publish a list of proposed tariffs for public comment within 15 days. USTR has already identified potential targets: 1,300 product lines worth about $48 billion. The president is also asking Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to come up with a list of restrictions on Chinese investment. A number of countries look like they will be exempt from the proposed US tariffs on steel and aluminium, including the European Union, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea. China of course is clearly in the frame. Here is the European side, from Daniel Boffey in Brussels: The EU believes it has won a temporary reprieve from president Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium after appealing to Washington to take a step back from a potential trade war. Following intensive talks in the US, the EU\u2019s commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, said she believed the omens were good, although she indicated concern that the situation could unravel. The US is set to impose 25% tariffs on steel and 10% tariffs on aluminium on Friday. The EU has argued that it should be exempt and has threatened to impose a series of retaliatory measures including import duties on US products. On returning to Brussels after a two-day trip, Malmstrom said she was confident the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, would suggest a temporary exemption for the EU but conceded that the decision remained in Trumps\u2019 hands. \u201cWe expect that we are on that list, we don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d she told the European parliament. \u201cIt is ultimately the president who decides this. But we expect that secretary Ross will recommend that the EU is excluded as a whole.\u201d The proposed tariffs\u2019 main target is China, which has been flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminium. However, Trump has had few kind words to say about the EU, claiming that it had made life difficult for US exporters. The full story is here: With markets tumbling it is no surprise the measure of volatility is on the way up again: Back with the Bank of England, and is a May rate rise a done deal? Our economics editor Larry Elliott says it would be a suprise if there is no increase but the Bank has been careful to give itself some wriggle room: A rate rise will depend on the economic data that is published over the next month and a half, but judging by the minutes of the MPC\u2019s March meeting that data would have to be quite poor for Threadneedle Street to sit tight. His full analysis is here: And here\u2019s our news story on the Bank\u2019s announcement: The weakness in the FTSE 100 could mean UK-listed companies being targets for potential predators, says Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor,: At current levels, the FTSE100 is just a few points from being down 10% in the year to date, knocking on the door of what is often described as correction territory. UK equities on the whole have fallen out of favour with international investors with the spectre of Brexit looming, whilst the recent relative strength of sterling has meant additional pressure on the premier index, where the majority of earnings come from overseas. Meanwhile, the possibility of trade disputes particularly between China and the US is denting sentiment, and the move towards tighter monetary policy is another brick in the wall of worry which investors are currently climbing. This is despite the global, synchronised economic recovery where corporate earnings have so far continued to justify some slightly rich valuations, especially in the US. The UK economy has remained resilient despite any impending Brexit fallout, with the result that some of the top quality FTSE100 companies are moving towards bargain territory \u2013 and could even, as a consequence of this index weakness, find foreign groups running the slide rule over some of them as potential bid targets. Markets continue under pressure, ahead of the announcement by President Trump of trade tariffs. Apart from fears of a trade war, investors are also concerned about the fallout from the current Facebook controversy, and the prospect of increased regulation for technology companies. Facebook itself has lost another 3% so far today. So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 370 points or 1.5%. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2% and France\u2019s Cac 2.16%. With the prospect of a UK interest rate rise in May, the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.6% to a new 15 month low. The pound\u2019s surge in the immediate wake of the Bank of England announcement has proved short lived, as investors decided that an interest rate rise in May had really already been priced into the market. Sterling has slipped 0.02% to \u20ac1.1455 against the euro and is down 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4116. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said: Sterling traded against the dollar was able to spike to a fresh seven-week high though it soon settled around 100 pips lower. It remained elevated relative to earlier in the month. Against the euro the pound made a similarly short-lived move to the highest levels since January but then retreated by 60 pips. In short, a May rate rise remains all but certain, but the market had largely priced it before Thursday. More signs of a fairly robust US economy, with the latest snapshots of the manufacturing and service sectors. The preliminary IHS Markit manufacturing PMI for March has come in at 55.7, up from 55.3 last month and the highest level since March 2015. The manufacturing figure was better than analysts had been expecting, but the services PMI - although strong - came in below forecasts. It fell from 55.9 in February to 54.1, a two month low. Overall the composite PMI dipped from 55.8 to 54.3 in March, but the index has been above the 50 mark (which signals expansion) for two years now. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The flash PMI surveys indicate that the economy likely continued to expand at a robust pace in March, rounding off a solid opening quarter of the year. The surveys are running at a level consistent with annualised first quarter GDP growth approaching 2.5% (though we note that official GDP estimates may once again understate growth in the opening quarter of the year). The survey\u2019s employment index is meanwhile at its highest for nearly three years and indicative of another strong payroll rise in the order of 240,000 in March. The improved hiring trend reflects buoyant optimism regarding future growth. Companies\u2019 expectations for output in the year ahead remained elevated, dipping slightly in services but surging to a three-year high in manufacturing. Inflationary pressures meanwhile remain a key theme of the surveys, especially in manufacturing, reflecting increased raw material prices, notably for metals. The survey found average prices charged for goods and services are rising at one of the strongest rates seen since 2014. Furthermore, with factory costs showing the largest jump for seven years amid growing shortages of key inputs, inflationary pressures appear to be on the rise. Back with UK interest rates, and there could be four over the next two years, reckons Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg: The Bank of England seems to be re-opening the playbook it used ahead of the November 2017 rate hike. Step one, signal to markets that a hike could come soon. Step two, let a couple of known hawks dissent in a policy vote shortly thereafter. Step three, hike rates. After signalling at the February 2018 Inflation Report that a rate hike could come soon, the minutes of the March Monetary Policy Committee meeting published today showed two members of the nine member Monetary Policy Committee \u2013 Saunders and McCafferty, both known hawks \u2013 voted in favour of raising the Bank Rate by 25bp to 0.75%. These are the same members that dissented ahead of the November hike. The March minutes strengthen the bank\u2019s February guidance that a hike could come soon. The real question is, when will it happen? ...We expect the BoE to hike its Bank Rate by 25bp four times over the next two years, with two hikes in 2018 and two in 2019. This would take the Bank Rate to 1.5% by the end of 2019. We look for the next 25bp hike in May 2018. Ouch! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has fallen to a fresh 15-month low. London\u2019s index of leading shares has lost 101 points, or nearly 1.5%, to 6937. That\u2019s its lowest point since December 2016. And over on Wall Street, shares are sliding too. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 310 points, or 1.2%, to 24,371 points. Traders are citing fears of trade wars, with Donald Trump expected to announce new tariffs on Chinese imports on Thursday. Those are likely to target China\u2019s high-technology sector and could also include restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States. Peter Dixon, Economist at Commerzbank, thinks there are two good reasons for the Bank of England to raise interest rates away from their near-record lows. nominal GDP growth in excess of 3% is not consistent with Bank Rate of 0.5% and the global monetary cycle, led by the Fed, would suggest that there is scope for a modest tightening in UK rates.\u201d A rate rise would be good news for savers. And Craig Inches, head of rates &amp; cash at Royal London Asset Management, suggests the Bank of England should have taken the plunge today. He argues: \u201cToday\u2019s decision not to raise rates was a missed opportunity in our opinion. With real wage growth moving into positive territory for the first time in over two years, strong retail sales (despite the adverse weather conditions) and some welcome progress on the Brexit negotiations, the uncertainty that has concerned the Bank in recent months is beginning to be demystified. \u201cThe markets were warned in February that rates would rise \u201cfaster and sooner\u201d, the question we\u2019d ask is why the Bank thought it necessary to wait until May. The probability of a rate rise now stands at over 75% following the vote today, sterling has risen in recent weeks from \u00a31.37 to \u00a31.42 and gilt short gilt yields have risen to the highs of the year. Given these moves and in light of the recent slew of positive data, the economy is clearly ready for a rate hike in May, but it would have been just as ready today! Inches is also concerned that the Bank hasn\u2019t begun unwinding its quantitative easing stimulus programme, which holds \u00a3435bn of government bonds. \u201cIn the meantime the Bank continues to buy gilts via the APF facility and is massively distorting the shape of the yield curve, which is detrimental for pension funds and an accident waiting to happen further down the line.\u201d Economist James Smith of Dutch bank ING says the Bank of England could potentially raise interest rates twice this year - perhaps once in May, and once in the autumn. But that could be undone if Brexit negotiations hit problems, Smith adds: By alluding to the need for \u201congoing tightening\u201d, policymakers have kept the door open to a second rate hike later this year. We certainly wouldn\u2019t rule it out, and markets are increasingly coming around to this view \u2013 there\u2019s now not far off two hikes priced in for this year. But if Brexit talks \u2013 which are due to be wrapped up in October to allow time for ratification \u2013 get particularly noisy, then this could get in the way of a second rate rise in the autumn. The City was surprised that two MPC policymakers wanted to raise interest rates today, says Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown. He suspects that Brexit angst is helping to split the monetary policy committee: Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders are worried that inaction now will mean rates will need to rise faster and further in future. Sterling jumped on the news, hitting a seven-week high against the dollar. The Bank faces a delicate balancing act. Inflation seems to be falling back towards the target of 2%, as the effect of the weaker pound starts to filter out of the calculation. But a pick-up in wage growth points to an erosion of slack in the labour market. This raises the prospect that a wage-price spiral could push inflation back up in future. Throw in a hefty dose of Brexit-related uncertainty and it\u2019s easy to see why the committee is divided at present. The Institute of Director\u2019s senior economist, Tej Parikh, reckons the Bank made the right decision this month. \u201cBusiness leaders will welcome the Bank of England\u2019s decision not to spring any surprises this month, but firms and households will be on tenterhooks for what comes in May. \u201cThe Bank has been paving the way for a rate rise, but must tread lightly until there is richer evidence of growing inflationary pressures, to avoid unnecessarily placing a speed bump in the way of economic activity. UK savers and borrowers should prepare for interest rates to rise in May, warns Ed Monk, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International: Monk says the recent pick-up in UK wage growth (to 2.8%, if you include bonuses) means the Bank is worried that the economy could overheat. \u201cThe message from the Bank of England to borrowers couldn\u2019t really be clearer: get ready for higher rates now. Two members voted for a rate rise this month and the Bank said nothing to dispel expectations that rates will rise in May. \u201cThe rate rise made in November felt like a straightforward reversal of the emergency post-Brexit cut, but this now feels more like we\u2019re entering a genuine tightening phase at the Bank. The minutes of this week\u2019s meeting show that the Bank of England expects to raise interest rates over the coming months, having left them at 0.5% today. It says: Given the prospect of excess demand over the forecast period, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a more conventional horizon. All members agreed that any future increases in Bank Rate were likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. However, there was a split among the Monetary Policy Committee over when to take the plunge and hike borrowing costs. Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders pushed for a rise today, arguing hawkishly that it would be reckless to wait: The minutes say: These members noted the widespread evidence that slack was largely used up and that pay growth was picking up, presenting upside risks to inflation in the medium term. A modest tightening of monetary policy at this meeting could mitigate the risks from a more sustained period of above-target inflation that might ultimately necessitate a more abrupt change in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment. But governor Mark Carney, deputies Ben Broadbent, Dave Ramsden and Jon Cunliffe, chief economist Andy Haldane, and external members Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe weren\u2019t convinced. They argued that it would be better to wait until they have new economic forecasts in May. There had been few surprises in recent economic data and the February Inflation Report projections, conditioned on a gently rising path of Bank Rate, had appeared broadly on track. The May forecast round would enable the Committee to undertake a fuller assessment of the underlying momentum in the economy, the degree of slack remaining and the extent of domestic inflationary pressures. The pound has jumped, following the news that two policymakers - Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders - voted to raise UK interest rates today. Sterling has hit \u20ac1.151 against the euro, the highest level since June 2017. It\u2019s also up against the US dollar at $1.420, a new seven-week high. That means traders are anticipating that the next rate hike will come soon - quite possibly at May\u2019s meeting. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. Two members of the MPC voted to hike rates, but were outvoted by the other seven policymakers. More to follow.... Five minutes to go, until we learn whether the Bank of England has voted to leave rates on hold.... Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 shares index has fallen below the 7,000 point mark for the first time in 15 months. Worries over trade wars, plus the strength of the pound, have combined to pull the index of blue-chip companies down to 6,983, a drop of 55 points. The team at Deutsche Bank believe the Bank of England will raise rates in two months time... Here\u2019s an explanation of how the Bank of England sets interest rates: The pound is pushing higher as traders get ready for the Bank of England decision, in under 50 minutes. Sterling has risen to \u20ac1.1489 against the euro, its highest levels since January 25th. The City may be preparing for a hawkish announcement from the BoE, paving the way for a rate rise in May (a hike today would be a real shock...) Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says: While a rate hike is not expected today, it is heavily priced in for May when the central bank will also release its inflation report containing new macro-economic projections. The Monetary Policy Committee has become notably more hawkish recently and the reference to rate hikes needing to come \u201csomewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent\u201d than it expected in November, last month was a clear reference to an upcoming meeting. If the MPC is still planning to raise in May, I would expect another clear hint from the central bank today. Over in the City, shares in printing group De La Rue have slumped by 5% after it missed out on the contract for Britain\u2019s new blue-coloured passport. De La Rue is fuming over the snub, especially as the contract has been awarded to Gemalto, a Franco-Dutch security firm. Somewhat ironic, as these new passports have been hailed by Brexiteers as a benefit of leaving the EU. De La Rue\u2019s CEO, Martin Sutherland, has warned that jobs could be lost. He wants Theresa May to: \u201ccome to my factory and explain my dedicated workforce why they think this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon\u201d. Unions are urging the government to reverse the decision. Unite national officer Louisa Bull says: \u201cTheresa May and Amber Rudd need to explain to De La Rue workers why \u2018taking back control\u2019 means their jobs could be put at risk while the production of Britain\u2019s new iconic passport is shipped overseas to France. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t happen in France because of national security and it shouldn\u2019t happen in the UK. De La Rue is the UK\u2019s leading security printer making bank notes as well as passports sustaining thousands of decent jobs in the UK. \u201cMinisters need to reverse this decision and start supporting British business and UK workers through public procurement and an industrial strategy which is more than just sound bites.\u201d The contract was awarded under EU procurement rules, though, so a u-turn wouldn\u2019t be easy. One could even argue that this is what free trade is all about..... The BBC\u2019s Rob Watson reckons the government will be worried: Optimism is building that Europe could win an exemption from America\u2019s new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has just held high-level talks with US officials, in an effort to prevent European metal-producers from being hit by Donald Trump\u2019s import duties, which kick in tomorrow. There\u2019s nothing official yet, but EU officials are hopeful that Malmstrom\u2019s efforts will pay off - and mean Europe needn\u2019t enforce its threat of retaliatory tariffs on US imports. European Commission vice-president Jyrki Katainen told Bloomberg TV that the visit went well. \u201cCecilia Malmstrom had a good, very fruitful visit to Washington,. We have good opportunities now to solve the issue and stabilize, or calm down, the problem.\u201d Last night, Malmstrom tweeted that the meetings had been productive: Newsflash: UK retail sales rose last month, but the broader picture is still downbeat. Retail sales volumes (the amount of stuff people bought) rose by 0.8% in February, compared to forecasts of just 0.4%. But after sharp falls earlier this winter, retail sales volumes are down 0.4% over the last quarter. On an annual basis, retail sales were up 1.5% - again, much weaker than last year, as households are stretched by the cost of living squeeze. This might make the Bank of England reluctant to raise borrowing costs.... The report also shows that consumers continued to spend more online. Internet shopping made up 17.2% of all retail spending, up from 15.6% a year ago. That helps explain why various high street chains have been struggling, or gone bust, in recent months. Rhian Murphy, ONS senior statistician, says: \u201cRetail sales did grow in February, with increases seen in food, non-store and fuel, but this followed two months of decline in these sectors. \u201cHowever, the underlying three-month picture is one of falling sales, mainly due to strong declines across all main sectors in December. \u201cStore prices continue to rise across all store types, but at a lower rate than the previous month due to a slowdown in price growth, though clothing and household goods stores continued to see stronger price rises. Just in: The eurozone\u2019s recent economic surge seems to be levelling off. Data firm Markit has reported that growth across eurozone service sector firms and manufacturers has slowed to its slowest since January 2017. Companies reported that growth had slowed after a very strong performance last year, with new order and exports both rising at a slower rate. Markit\u2019s \u2018composite output PMI\u2019, which tracks activity across the eurozone\u2019s private sector, dropped to 55.3 in March from 57.1 last month. At a country level, output growth slowed to a seven-month low in France and an eight-month low in Germany. It\u2019s not a reason to panic -- the PMIs had been remarkably strong last year, so this is a return to more normal growth levels. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says recent bad weather is one factor, plus \u2018growing pains\u2019 as European supply chains struggle to keep pace with recent growth. But political issues - such as Brexit, and trade tariffs - are another factor. Williamson says: The fact that export order book growth has more than halved since the end of last year suggests the stronger euro is taking an increasing toll on export performance. Survey responses also highlighted how political uncertainty also appears to have intensified, dampening demand. The data therefore suggest that eurozone growth peaked around the turn of the year and the region is settling into a slower, but still robust pace of expansion. European stock markets have dropped this morning, as investors fret about the risks of a trade war. The FTSE 100 is down 13 points, or 0.2%, at 7021 after falling through 7,000 points at the start of trading. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 0.4%. Exporters are suffering from the strength of the pound and the euro against the US dollar today. The markets are also being pulled down by signs that Wall Street will fall, especially if Donald Trump does to hit China with new sanctions. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The state of the Dow futures, alongside the re-emergence of trade war chatter ahead of Trump\u2019s China tariff announcement later this Thursday, left the European indices in a sorry state after the bell. Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank is confident the Bank of England will leave rates on hold today: We expect policy to be left unchanged at this meeting. The focus of attention will be on whether there are any clues that support the case for a rate hike at the May MPC meeting. Given fairly mixed data since February, we would not be too surprised if the vote was 9-0 for unchanged rates and that should not be seen as an obstruction to a hike in May. But analysts at Mitsubishi UFG warn that a shock hike can\u2019t be ruled out.... The US dollar has fallen against other major currencies overnight, as traders digested Jerome Powell\u2019s debut press conference since becoming Fed chief. I thought Powell handled the occasion pretty well (rattling through the questions within 45 minutes, not the full hour available). He was upbeat about the US economy, avoided any bear traps, and reassured listeners that the Fed would take the \u2018middle ground\u2019 as it seeks to normalise monetary policy without slowing growth. So why has the dollar fallen? Firstly, the Fed stuck to its forecast of three rate hikes in 2018, rather than slipping in a fourth. Investors can take that as a dovish signal (although the Fed is now forecasting an extra hike in 2019). Secondly, Powell revealed that business leaders have told Fed officials they\u2019re worried about a trade war breaking out. That\u2019s a timely warning, as president Trump is expected to announce new tariffs and investment restrictions on China later today. That\u2019s enough to drive the pound up to a six-week high against the dollar, at $1.417. China\u2019s central bank has responded to last night\u2019s move in US interest rates, by hiking its own borrowing costs. The People\u2019s Bank of China increased the cost of short-term loans to commercial lenders, hours after the Fed announced it was tightening policy in America. Bloomberg has the details: The People\u2019s Bank of China raised the interest rates it charges on 7-day reverse-repurchase agreements by five basis points, the central bank said in a statement. The move is \u201cin line with market expectations and a normal reaction to the Fed\u2019s rate hike\u201d, the PBOC said in a statement on the website. The Bank of England could send the pound shooting higher at lunchtime, if it hints at a rate hike in the next few months (or even raises rates today, of course). Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, explains: The focus today will be on the Bank of England rate decision which will have a significant effect on the medium-term outlook of the British pound. The UK currency has seen good demand over the past few days being supported by expectations for a positive labour market report - which indeed printed in a bullish fashion yesterday - but also hopes for a hawkish tone from the BoE today. The key drivers for this upbeat bias? Inflation rebounded higher last month, we noted good wage growth in yesterday\u2019s employment report and there has even been progress in the Brexit negotiations. All these factors paint a positive outlook for the pound and shape expectations for a bullish BoE message which will underpin investors\u2019 hopes for a rate hike soon. There\u2019s some speculation that the BoE might even go ahead and raise rates today but we believe that this is too optimistic - our base scenario suggests an interest rate increase in the summer, either in May or June. Today though a positive message and a consistent bullish bias from the British central bank will keep the pound in demand: we\u2019re looking to the pound/ dollar to extend gains towards 1.42 and euro/ pound to break below the 0.87 mark. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the Bank of England\u2019s turn under the spotlight today, as policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee will set UK interest rates at noon today , We\u2019re not expecting a rate hike today, just four months after the first one in a decade. But the MPC could decide to steer the markets towards a move in May, as it tries to balance inflation pressures against Brexit uncertainty. The MPC have some interesting economic data to digest, which may encourage policymakers to reach for the \u2018rate hike\u2019 button soon. Tuesday\u2019s drop in inflation to 2.7% took some pressure off the Bank, although prices are still rising faster than its 2% target. That was followed by yesterday\u2019s strong labour market report, showing that wages are rising at their fastest pace since 2015, and catching up with inflation. Policymakers may conclude that this strengthens the case for a rate hike soon, rather than risk waiting too long. This chart, from Berenberg bank, suggests the labour market is recovering from the Brexit shock of 2016, which drove real wages down. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg explains: Thanks to the drop in headline inflation to 2.7% in February (3.0% in January), and the uptick in nominal weekly earnings to 2.8% in January (up from 1.9% in May 2017), the real wage squeeze is probably over. Tight labour markets should push nominal wage growth higher over the medium term as inflation gradually trends towards a rate of about 2-2.5%. Real weekly earnings growth can rise towards 1.0% by the end of the 2018. Helped by continued jobs growth, this should allow real consumption to grow at close to 1.5% over the medium term. The minutes of the meeting, released at noon, will give an insight into the MPC\u2019s thinking. Last night, the US Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate to 1.75%, and lifted its growth forecast. It also predicted two more rate hikes this year, and three in 2019, as the process of normalising monetary policy continues under new Fed chair Jerome Powell. Powell sounded upbeat about the US economy, but also warned that fears of a trade war are building. We also get a new healthcheck on eurozone service sector firms and factories, fresh UK retail sales figures, and the weekly US jobless claims numbers.

The UK currency has seen good demand over the past few days being supported by expectations for a positive labour market report - which indeed printed in a bullish fashion yesterday - but also hopes for a hawkish tone from the BoE today. The key drivers for this upbeat bias? <strong>Inflation rebounded higher last month, we noted good wage growth in yesterday\u2019s employment report and there has even been progress in the Brexit negotiations.</strong></p> \n   <p>All these factors paint a positive outlook for the pound and shape expectations for a bullish BoE message which will underpin investors\u2019 hopes for a rate hike soon. There\u2019s some speculation that the BoE might even go ahead and raise rates today but we believe that this is too optimistic - our base scenario suggests an interest rate increase in the summer, either in May or June. <strong>Today though a positive message and a consistent bullish bias from the British central bank will keep the pound in demand: we\u2019re looking to the pound/ dollar to extend gains towards 1.42 and euro/ pound to break below the 0.87 mark.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ab35b87e4b044506eec1123\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-22T07:51:52.055Z\">7.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">The agenda: Will Bank of England hint at a May hike?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e0c5c1b832c7554bdc7f84003d611957a30f4136\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0c5c1b832c7554bdc7f84003d611957a30f4136/0_0_2721_2461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"904\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BOE governor Mark Carney.</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s the Bank of England\u2019s turn under the spotlight today, as policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee will set UK interest rates at noon today , </p> \n  <p>We\u2019re not expecting a rate hike today, just four months after the first one in a decade.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has ousted the boss of its upmarket food halls and drafted in the supermarket industry veteran Stuart Machin with a brief to cut prices and improve the food ranges. Machin, whose career has included stints at Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco, worked with the M&amp;S chairman, Archie Norman, in Australia on the turnaround of Coles Supermarkets. Last year Norman warned that M&amp;S had been \u201cdrifting\u201d for more than 15 years and pledged to lead a radical shake-up of the business alongside the chief executive, Steve Rowe. As a result of Machin\u2019s appointment, the current food boss, Andy Adcock, will leave M&amp;S at the end of April. He joined M&amp;S\u2019s food arm in 2009 as commercial director and was promoted to the top job in the summer of 2015. \u201cWe face challenges in our food business and we have lots to do to change fast,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cStuart is an excellent addition to our team. He gets food retailing and he has first-class experience of driving change in big food retailers.\u201d Until recently M&amp;S\u2019s food halls had been its jewel in the crown amid a long-running slump in clothing sales. But over the past year its performance has deteriorated with Rowe warning that its prices were too high at a time when the mainstream grocers had raised the bar in ready meals and other convenience foods. It had also made mistakes, axing products that customers had missed, while an attempt to cut back on waste resulted in gaps on shelves. More recently M&amp;S said it was putting the brakes on ambitious plans to open more food stores. \u201cAt M&amp;S we need to sharpen our prices, improve our products, drive profitability and grow market share,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cStuart is the right leader to get on and deliver these changes.\u201d Machin, who starts next month, is the latest in a series of appointments that are part of a turnaround which also involves a major shake-up of its UK store estate. His role mirrors that of the former Halfords boss Jill McDonald, who took charge of its struggling clothing and homewares business last year. M&amp;S has also recently enlisted the services of the business guru Julian Richer, founder of Richer Sounds, to advise it on culture change. Machin is joining from the furniture arm of troubled South African group Steinhoff International, where he ran the Bensons for Beds and Harveys chains. \u201cMy heart lies in food retail,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business has many reasons to be proud of its food offer, but there are also opportunities and lots to deliver under the transformation plan Steve has laid out.\u201d",

Last year Norman warned that M&amp;S had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/08/marks-and-spencer-speeds-up-shut-down-of-clothing-scales-back-simply-food\">\u201cdrifting\u201d for more than 15 years </a>and pledged to lead a radical shake-up of the business alongside the chief executive, Steve Rowe. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result of Machin\u2019s appointment, the current food boss, Andy Adcock, will leave M&amp;S at the end of April. He joined M&amp;S\u2019s food arm in 2009 as commercial director and was promoted to the top job in the summer of 2015.</p> <p>\u201cWe face challenges in our food business and we have lots to do to change fast,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cStuart is an excellent addition to our team. He gets food retailing and he has first-class experience of driving change in big food retailers.\u201d</p> <p>Until recently M&amp;S\u2019s food halls had been its jewel in the crown amid a long-running slump in clothing sales. But over the past year its performance has deteriorated with Rowe warning that its prices were too high at a time when the mainstream grocers had raised the bar in ready meals and other convenience foods. It had also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/11/investors-spooked-slowdown-marks-spencer-food-sales\">made mistakes</a>, axing products that customers had missed, while an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/09/m-and-s-hand-out-thousands-tonnes-food-waste-neighbourly\">attempt to cut back on waste</a> resulted in gaps on shelves. More recently M&amp;S said it was putting the brakes on ambitious plans to open more food stores.</p> <p>\u201cAt M&amp;S we need to sharpen our prices, improve our products, drive profitability and grow market share,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cStuart is the right leader to get on and deliver these changes.\u201d</p> <p>Machin, who starts next month, is the latest in a series of appointments that are part of a turnaround which also involves a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/m-and-s-marks-spencer-close-80-stores-major-overhaul\">major shake-up of its UK store estate</a>. His role mirrors that of the former Halfords boss <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/03/marks-and-spencer-halfords-clothing-jill-mcdonald\">Jill McDonald</a>, who took charge of its struggling clothing and homewares business last year. M&amp;S has also recently enlisted the services of the business guru Julian Richer, founder of Richer Sounds, to advise it on culture change.</p> <p>Machin is joining from the furniture arm of troubled South African group Steinhoff International, where he ran the Bensons for Beds and Harveys chains. \u201cMy heart lies in food retail,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business has many reasons to be proud of its food offer, but there are also opportunities and lots to deliver under the transformation plan Steve has laid out.\u201d </p>",

Next, a couple of members of its monetary policy committee break ranks and vote for borrowing costs to go up. Finally, the other members of the committee say they too think that the time is right for action. This is how the Bank of England softened up the public when it raised interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November, and the same pattern is being followed again. In February, Threadneedle Street used its quarterly Inflation Report to signal that borrowing costs would be going up sooner and by more than the City had previously expected. This month, the two most hawkish members of the MPC \u2013 Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders \u2013 said they wanted rates to go up immediately on the grounds that a failure to deal with rising inflationary pressure would risk a more severe tightening of policy later. As a result, the markets drew the obvious conclusion: when the MPC next meets in early May it will announce an increase in interest rates to 0.75%. That would be quite a moment, because since early 2009 official borrowing costs have been set at 0.5% or lower. So is a May move a done deal? Not quite, because the Bank has been careful to leave itself a bit of wriggle room. A rate rise will depend on the economic data that is published over the next month and a half, but judging by the minutes of the MPC\u2019s March meeting that data would have to be quite poor for Threadneedle Street to sit tight. One key piece of data that will come out before the May decision is the flash estimate of growth in the first quarter from the Office for National Statistics. The Bank thinks this will be just 0.3% given the 0.1 percentage points that will be lost as a result of the weather disruption at the start of March. As a result, it would take a figure of 0.2% for the Bank to have a radical rethink. Forward-looking indicators are likely to point to a bounce-back in growth in the second quarter. The Brexit implementation deal should boost business confidence while falling inflation and rising wage growth will bolster consumer spending. It is not certain that the Bank will raise rates in May, but it will now be a big surprise if it doesn\u2019t.",

The company, which is more than 200 years old, describes itself as the world\u2019s largest commercial producer of currency and passports and claims to supply products to two-thirds of all countries. Domestically, the company has contracts with the Bank of England, Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland to produce the newer polymer bank notes. It has been introducing the technology around the world, with Botswana and the Maldives other countries to have made the switch. De La Rue also prints money for Qatar, Kuwait, the Bahamas and the Seychelles, among others. The biggest concern over the loss of the UK passport contract centres on the company\u2019s printing plant in Gateshead where it employs 600 people, of whom about 100 are thought to work in the passport division. The company has not said these jobs have been put at risk. The chief executive, Martin Sutherland, said: \u201cWe have a very skilled, proud workforce in Gateshead and I am going to have face those workers, look at them in the whites of the eyes and try to explain to them why the British government thinks it\u2019s a sensible decision to buy French passports not British passports. \u201cI would like to invite Theresa May or Amber Rudd to come to my factory and explain to my dedicated workforce why they think this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon.\u201d As well as UK passports, the company manufactures identity documents and e-passports for countries as far apart as Trinidad and Tobago, Qatar and Afghanistan. On occasion it also uses its printing presses to make special-edition bank notes. A Star Wars note issued in support of the Together For Short Lives charity raised more than \u00a3185,000 in an eBay auction in November. De La Rue printers have a long history, going back to 1813 when Thomas de la Rue published the first edition of the Guernsey newspaper Le Miroir Politique. Within eight years, De la Rue had established himself in London as a printer and stationer. By 1855 the company was printing postage stamps, and in 1860 it began printing money, at first for Mauritius. Over the years it has also manufactured playing cards, board games and fountain pens. De La Rue was part of the Camelot consortium that bid for the first UK national lottery contracts in the 1990s. It sold its interest in Camelot in 2010.

    "webTitle": "Labour urges crackdown on Russian money laundering through Scotland", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Labour has called on the government to stage a crackdown on potential Russian money laundering through opaque shell companies based in Scotland, after finding that nearly 17,000 are flouting the law. More than half of all Scottish limited partnerships (SLPs) - structures originally established in the early 1900s for farm holdings but now popular among private equity firms and investors in the former eastern bloc - have not disclosed the identity of their beneficial owners, despite new rules introduced last year. Labour attacked the government for failing to enforce the law, introduced in June to force the almost 30,000 SLPs in the UK to register their ownership or face a \u00a3500 fine for every day they are not registered. The party said the new law had resulted in no prosecutions and up to \u00a32.2bn in uncollected fines because 16,812 firms have been unregistered for 266 days. Shadow Treasury minister Anneliese Dodds said the lack of action showed the government was soft on money laundering. \u201cWe need immediate and powerful action to stop the flow of dirty money from Russia and elsewhere into the UK,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly two weeks ago we discovered that no prosecutions had been brought forward as a result of the 2017 criminal offence for failure to prevent money laundering. This is another advert to oligarchs and crooks that the UK is open to business due to the Conservative government\u2019s failure to use their powers.\u201d The intervention comes as Labour attempts to put itself back on the front foot following criticism over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s response to the attack on Sergei Skripal, the former Russian agent poisoned in Salisbury. The Labour leader had warned Theresa May against \u201crushing way ahead of the evidence\u201d after the poisoning, in what was seen as a lacklustre response to the government\u2019s moves against Moscow and drew criticism from Conservatives and some of his own MPs. The latest move remakes the argument posed by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who told the Guardian last week he would be tougher than May on Russia by starving \u201cgangster politicians\u201d of cash. He said Labour would \u201chammer\u201d money laundering in the UK should the party come to power, arguing a crackdown on secretive financial arrangements used in the City of London would be a more effective weapon against Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime than expelling Russian diplomats. The use of SLP business structures have previously been found at the centre of the \u201cGlobal Laundromat\u201d, a large-scale money laundering scheme that moved more than $20bn (\u00a314.2bn) out of Russia, reported by the Guardian last year. More than 100 SLPs were used to launder $20bn to $80bn between 2010 and 2014 in the laundromat, while almost $3bn was channeled through shell companies based in Glasgow in a similar scheme to move cash out of Azerbaijan into the UK to buy luxury goods and peddle political influence throughout Europe. The number of SLPs used in the UK has increased rapidly in recent years following a tightening of the law elsewhere in 2006. More than 40% of beneficial owners are either a national of a former-Soviet country or a company incorporated there, compared to just 0.1% for all limited companies, according to Global Witness. Both Labour and the SNP have applied pressure for a tougher crackdown on the use of SLPs, which are seen as one of the main routes for filtering dirty money into the UK and laundering it. Ben Wallace, minister for security and economic crime, admitted to MPs during a debate over money laundering instigated by Labour this week that he was concerned SLPs were \u201cremarkably popular with countries such as Russia and Ukraine\u201d and said more action would be taken. He said the government was taking steps to make it harder for criminals to launder money through property, jewellery and betting, adding: \u201cWhoever the crooks are, wherever they are from, and no matter what their nationality, we will pursue them and their cash.\u201d",

Sterling rose on foreign exchanges on news that Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders had backed a quarter-point rise in the bank rate to 0.75%. While the other seven members of the MPC voted to leave rates unchanged, the tone of the minutes of this week\u2019s meeting left the City convinced that an upward move was on the way. Although the economy grew by a modest 0.4% in the final three months of 2017, the MPC said there was a chance activity in late 2017 would be revised higher and signalled concern about rising earnings growth. \u201cThe unemployment rate remained low in the three months to January. The firming of shorter-term measures of wage growth in recent quarters and a range of survey indicators suggest pay growth will rise further in response to the tightening labour market,\u201d the MPC said. The minutes added that the view of the MPC had not changed since last month, when the Bank used its quarterly inflation report to say that the prospect of excess demand meant interest rates would need to rise in order to keep the annual inflation rate sustainably close to its 2% target. The seven MPC members voting for no change said May \u2013 when the Bank publishes its next quarterly economic health check \u2013 would be the right time to assess the extent of domestic inflationary pressure. A majority of the committee said little had changed since its February meeting and adopted a wait-and-see approach. McCafferty and Saunders said there was \u201cwidespread evidence\u201d that spare capacity in the economy was largely used up and that pay growth was on the increase, presenting upside risks to inflation. According to the minutes, the duo said \u201ca modest tightening of monetary policy at this meeting could mitigate the risks from a more sustained period of above-target inflation that might ultimately necessitate a more abrupt change in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Radical stuff from the European commission: it is proposing a tax on the revenues of large digital companies operating in the EU, to be levied at 3%. The idea breaches the basic principle that corporate taxes should be charged on profits, not turnover, and thus will cause conflict with the US and probably a few EU countries too. But Brussels deserves support. No measure to date has halted the massive under-taxation of global technology firms. A crude local revenue tax, intended to operate until an international solution can be agreed, is better than the current state of affairs. Digital businesses pay an effective average tax rate of only 9.5%, compared with 23.2% for bricks-and-mortar firms, according to the commission. We know why. The global tax system was designed for a different age and it is too easy for large technology firms to shift intellectual property and profits to low-tax territories. The contortions are legal (mostly) but the result is a skewed system that is a tech subsidy by another name. Other taxpayers are obliged to fill the inevitable tax shortfall. The commission calculates that a 3% tax on local revenues from tightly defined digital activities would raise \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.36bn) annually. Spread across 150 qualifying large companies \u2013 including Apple, Facebook and Google \u2013 the sum cannot be described as punitive. Nor can the tech titans really have believed their free lunch would last forever. When challenged over elaborate tax arrangements, executives have tended to argue that they play by the rules as they find them, and that if politicians want a different system they should change the law. Now the commission is inviting EU governments to do exactly that. The UK Treasury, perhaps surprisingly, has itself flirted with the attractions of a revenue tax. Here is a proposal it can support \u2013 before and after we leave the EU. Aviva: picking the wrong battle? Aviva\u2019s hard-charging chief executive, Mark Wilson, gets plaudits for restoring financial discipline to the FTSE 100 insurer, but sometimes he needs to slow down. Since declaring last week that Aviva was generating excess cash and that the moment had arrived to have some \u201cfun\u201d, he has walked into a unfunny City row. At one level, the quarrel is merely technical. The dispute is over Aviva\u2019s claim that it is entitled to cancel \u00a3450m worth of \u201cirredeemable\u201d preference shares at their par value of 100p. Since the coupon, or annual interest rate, on these shares is 9%-10% (they were issued a couple of decades ago), the market price was much higher \u2013 about 170p. Shareholders are understandably furious that their investment has plunged in value by a quarter. They thought they owned something more like a fixed-income bond. Aviva says it is pursuing financial efficiency. Regulators have decreed that preference shares will no longer count as core capital from 2026. Plus, the company would save \u00a338m annually by paying to cancel at par, which would be a good trade for ordinary shareholders. Even if Aviva\u2019s lawyers have triple-checked the legal basis (the Financial Conduct Authority wants the details), the manoeuvre smells completely off. Try explaining to Joe Punter why it is fair to call something irredeemable and then declare that cancellation doesn\u2019t count as redemption under section 641 of the Companies Act. Every private investor group in the land, and the big battalions of M&amp;G, Legal &amp; General and Prudential, is opposed. Aviva hasn\u2019t yet put a formal proposal on the table, so its bald \u201cmay we remind you of our legal rights\u201d approach may be the opening position in a negotiation. But it is aggressive, will cause maximum aggravation and cannot be good for the company\u2019s reputation. The insurer\u2019s other news last week was only slightly less awkward. Wilson has accepted a non-executive post at BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager and thus surely a direct competitor to Aviva Investors. Does Wilson \u2013 and Sir Adrian Montague, chairman of Aviva, for that matter \u2013 stop to think about how these things look? Spotlight on audit watchdog The surprise in the latest Carillion hearings wasn\u2019t that a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers can charge \u00a3865 an hour for his time: there is no real competition at the top end of the consultancy market, especially in cases when half the rivals are tainted by past association with the fallen firm. Rather, the revelation was that the business secretary, Greg Clark, is about to order a review of the Financial Reporting Council, the audit watchdog. It is unclear whether he suspects the FRC lacks powers or is simply feeble at using the ones it has. Either way, an investigation is overdue. Even before Carillion, faith in the auditing of UK companies was low and falling.",
