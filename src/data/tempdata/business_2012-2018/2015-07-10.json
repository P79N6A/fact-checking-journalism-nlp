      "bodyText": "The number of property millionaires in Britain has more than doubled over the past three years and broken through the 500,000 mark for the first time, it is claimed. There are now 13 streets where the average house price is more than \u00a310m \u2013 all of them in London \u2013 and almost 11,000 across the UK where homes are typically worth more than \u00a31m. Despite a slowdown in activity in the property market and small price drops in some of the country\u2019s most expensive neighbourhoods, the past year has seen the cost of homes continue to surge in many areas. Recent Land Registry figures showed that in 24 out of 33 London boroughs, annual price growth was still in double figures, and a shortage of homes coming onto the market has propped up prices even when demand has fallen. Due to the seemingly relentless rise in prices, the property website Zoopla said 524,306 homes were now worth more than \u00a31m, turning their owners into property millionaires \u2013 before any mortgage debt is taken into account. This compares with 484,081 in Zoopla\u2019s 2014 rich list in 2014, and 245,790 in 2012. The rich list figures, which are based on the asking prices for homes listed on the site and previous sold prices for each property and other similar houses which have changed hands nearby, show on 10,958 streets, the average house price is now above \u00a31m. Of these, 43% are found in London. However, concerns over possible taxes on \u00a32m-plus properties in the runup to the general election, together with changes to stamp duty rules which increased the cost at the top end of the market, seem to have taken a toll on the prices boasted by the country\u2019s richest streets. Kensington Palace Gardens \u2013 home to the billionaires Roman Abramovich and Lakshmi Mittal, plus the Foxtons estate agency founder, Jon Hunt \u2013 remained the most expensive place to live, with an average price of \u00a342.6m, down 0.45% on 2014\u2019s figure. In the Boltons, another highly-prized address in Kensington and Chelsea where a nine-bedroom detached house sold for \u00a351m in April, Zoopla said values had dropped 4.46% over the year to an average of \u00a330.3m. On the third-placed Grosvenor Crescent, in Belgravia, a short walk from Buckingham Palace, values had fallen 4.12% to an average of \u00a322.8m. Lawrence Hall of Zoopla said: \u201cWhile property prices on some of London\u2019s most prestigious roads are still beyond the realms of comprehension for most of us, several of the most desirable streets have seen average values decrease over the past 12 months. This is most likely due to uncertainty in relation to the mansion tax that was mooted by Labour in the runup to the election, which caused temporary stagnation at the top end of the market.\u201d In the south-east outside London, Zoopla found 3,697 streets of million-pound homes. On six streets in Surrey, the average price was found to be more than \u00a35m, with Sunninghill Road in Windlesham, near Ascot, topping the list at \u00a35.4m. In the north of England, several streets in Greater Manchester have average values above \u00a32m, with Broadway in Hale, Altrincham, coming in at \u00a32.6m. In Scotland, the most expensive street is Whitehouse Terrace, where the average value of homes has broken through the \u00a32m mark. The list of most expensive towns is headed by Virginia Water, Surrey, where the average price rose 1.8% to \u00a31.2m. In Cobham, also in Surrey, a 6% year-on-year increase in property values put prices through the \u00a31m barrier for the first time. Cobham is a favourite among Chelsea footballers as it is the location of the club\u2019s training complex. Ed Mead, executive director of estate agents Douglas &amp; Gordon, said Southfields in south London was an example of an area where prices had gone through the \u00a31m barrier over the past year. Three-bedroom homes in the neighbourhood, which is close to the Wimbledon tennis tournament, now change hands for at least that sum. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing, with average prices going from \u00a3650,000 for such a property to around \u00a31.05m over the last three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt clearly signals the search for \u2018value\u2019 currently being undertaken by families looking for relief from the recent acute gains seen in both prime central London and the areas immediately surrounding it.\u201d The report is likely to further bolster the attractions of property as an investment. Recent research by the Office for National Statistics found that 42% people thought that investing in bricks and mortar was most likely to \u201cmake the most of your money\u201d of all types of asset.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Andy Palmer was a successful senior executive at one of the biggest car companies in the world. He had no financial worries and was surrounded by the love of his family. Life was good; but it wasn\u2019t enough. That was two years ago. Palmer had just turned 50 and even though he was among the top three executives at Nissan, where he had enjoyed a 23-year career, doubts gnawed away at him. Since the age of 20, the ambitious Brit had wanted to run a car company. \u201cI just thought, what happened to that 20-something-year-old upstart who told everyone, including Nissan, that he was going to be the boss of the company?\u201d said Palmer, who took over as chief executive at Aston Martin in October. \u201cI realised I hadn\u2019t done what I wanted to do, and then I realised that there aren\u2019t that many car companies that you can run because they are either huge corporations or belong to a family. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s a pretty big talent pool competing for about 10 top jobs in the industry.\u201d Palmer\u2019s bout of soul searching was brought to a juddering halt last year when Aston Martin came calling for him. The Midlands-based sports carmaker was crying out for some stability. It is the only manufacturer of luxury sports cars that isn\u2019t owned by one of the industry giants and was in dire financial straits. Aston is loved and revered in Britain; it is James Bond\u2019s carmaker of choice. And yet, that groundswell of affection has consistently failed to translate into financial success. For much of its 101-year history, Aston has teetered on the brink. Successive owners and chief executives have been hammered by heavy losses \u2013 \u00a325m in 2013 and \u00a336m the year before. Palmer now has six years in which to make Aston profitable and self-financing. He has a \u00a3500m warchest for new products and the company has just raised a further \u00a3200m by issuing preference shares to City investors. \u201cI want to balance the portfolio so we don\u2019t go through this feast and famine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to generate enough cashflow so I don\u2019t have to go out with the begging bowl. The plan is to bring the company to profitability within six years. So that, for the next 100 years, [Aston] won\u2019t go bankrupt.\u201d Palmer is clear that Aston Martin must remain firmly rooted in the luxury segment, but it must also spread its wings further than its core sports car market. He is planning a raft of new product launches. One of the first new models to roll off the line at Aston\u2019s headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire, is likely to be a sporty 4x4 \u2013 the DBX. Having the support of a settled group of shareholders is key, Palmer acknowledges. For years, Aston has been passed around like some prized trophy asset. In 1987, Ford bought a majority stake but sold it in 2007 to a consortium including Kuwaiti investors. Then, two years ago, Investindustrial \u2013 an Italian private equity firm that turned around Ducati before selling it to Audi \u2013 snapped up a 37.5% stake. Daimler, the German giant that owns Mercedes, took a 5% stake last year in return for a deal to supply the Midlands producer with engines and electronic technology. Palmer believes this deal could prove crucial in securing Aston\u2019s survival, but denies it is a precursor to a full takeover by the Germans. \u201cIt could happen,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut if I\u2019ve done my job properly, it\u2019s going to be more expensive. Daimler should have bought it now because it\u2019s cheap.\u201d He also notes that Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler, has repeatedly stated that he doesn\u2019t want to buy Aston outright. However, it does not want this jewel of British auto engineering falling into anyone else\u2019s hands. \u201cMy personal opinion is that the most credible way for one of our shareholders to exit is to IPO,\u201d says Palmer. The Aston boss is affable, engaging and chatty. It is easy to see why Aston\u2019s investors plucked this ambitious, likeable executive from the summit of the Nissan empire. He may be running James Bond\u2019s carmaker of choice, but Daniel Craig needn\u2019t worry about his 007 role just yet. Palmer looks more like Blofeld than Bond. The endless stream of lunches and sedentary lifestyle of a top executive have taken their toll. Palmer runs his fingers through his rapidly receding hairline and leans back in the chair, which puts extra strain on one shirt button at the apex of his round stomach. \u201cIt seems odd now, looking at me, but I used to be quite sporty when I was younger,\u201d he says. \u201cI was into tennis, badminton and fencing. I\u2019ve also always had bikes and cars.\u201d The 52-year-old still rides a BMW K1600 motorbike at weekends, and races an Aston Martin Vantage GT4. Moving back to Britain has been more of a wrench for Palmer than his Japanese wife, who he met at Nissan in Britain, and youngest daughter, who is eight, and was born in Japan. He has three other children from a previous marriage. \u201cIf I could import sushi, I would be in a perfect world,\u201d he says. In many ways, Palmer has come home. He was born in nearby Stratford Upon Avon and did his apprenticeship down the road at a car parts firm in Leamington Spa 35 years ago. He and his brother, who is five years younger, had a humble upbringing just a few miles from Gaydon. His father was an engineer, his mother a secretary. \u201cI didn\u2019t much like school,\u201d he recalls. He failed his 11-plus exam and instead focused on his dream of becoming a car engineer. Despite his early antipathy to academia, Palmer has since completed a masters degree in product engineering and a doctorate in management from Cranfield University. So why does Palmer think he can succeed at Aston when so many others have failed? Sitting in his first-floor office at Aston\u2019s white-walled and glass-panelled head office, he recounts the tale of Chesley Sullenberger. Sullenberger was the US Airways pilot who landed his plane in the Hudson river off Manhattan in January 2009 after it hit a flock of Canada geese. The veteran pilot\u2019s splashdown saved all 155 passengers and crew. \u2018Captain Cool\u2019 retired not long after but remarked, memorably for Palmer, that every day of his 42-year career had been training for that one moment. After the apprenticeship at the car parts company, Palmer joined Austin Rover, where he first encountered the jaw-dropping attention to detail that Honda brought to a joint venture. \u201cFrom that moment, I was hooked,\u201d Palmer says of his encounter with Japanese industrial practice. So off he went to Nissan, where he spent 24 years, including a 13-year stint in Japan. In that time, he became one of Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn\u2019s closest confidants. When he quit, Palmer was chief planning officer of Nissan, and was responsible for directing strategy. He also launched cars such as the electric Leaf, and was chairman of the Infiniti luxury brand. It was a big risk to take, leaving behind such a powerful group that produces more than 8m cars a year, to head a much-loved but niche sports carmaker that sells around 4,000 a year. Palmer chuckles: \u201cI thought you guys [the media] would say I\u2019d gone mad \u2013 going from the number 3 in Nissan to running this cottage industry.\u201d It may have seemed crazy, but Ghosn must have been pleased for him? For the first time, the garrulous Palmer pauses and appears tense. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. I suppose he was disappointed.\u201d Palmer is clearly hurt by the snub, but tries to shrug it off: \u201cAt the top end of this industry, it\u2019s a pretty ruthless place. I take more solace from the friends I made and still have at Nissan. I also look at the success of the Qashqai and that makes me quite happy. \u201cIn 50 years\u2019 time, nobody is going to remember who the number 2 or 3 at Nissan was.\u201d The British car industry and foreign ownership Aston Martin is the last British carmaker not owned by one of the powerful global giants of the auto industry. Volkswagen snapped up Bentley in 1998, while Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Mini are a part of BMW\u2019s burgeoning stable. Jaguar Land Rover has enjoyed a stunning rags-to-riches ride since Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate, bought it in 2008. JLR fell on hard times not long after it was bought, but continued investment in new products by Tata and a push into lucrative overseas markets such as China have made it one of Britain\u2019s most powerful industry players. Foreign owners have been keen to cash in on the cachet of these historic British marques, while other overseas players have been queuing up to take advantage of the flexible working conditions and business-friendly climate in Britain. Nissan, Ford, Toyota, General Motors and Honda all have large car and engine-making operations in Britain \u2013 providing thousands of well-paid jobs in employment black spots. British auto manufacturing hit its peak in 1972, when 1.92m cars rolled off production lines. That figure fell to about 1.6m in the years preceding the collapse of Rover, Britain\u2019s last homegrown volume carmaker. Production fell below 1m during the financial crash of 2008/09 as the credit crunch sapped buyers\u2019 confidence. Since then, production has rebounded; it has overtaken the 1.5m mark, and Britain is the third-largest car manufacturer in Europe after Germany and Spain. Britain\u2019s car industry is booming again. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), Britain\u2019s car industry generates annual turnover of \u00a364bn; it directly employs 160,000 people and supports a total of 770,000 across the wider sector. Manufacturers including Honda and JLR announced more than \u00a31bn of investment in the UK in March after 2014 proved to be the sector\u2019s best year since the financial crisis. This week, the SMMT said new car sales rose to a record first-half high as buyers took advantage of cheap finance deals and low interest rates to grab the latest models. The data also showed that first-half sales of British-built cars were the strongest for five years, with one in six buyers driving off in such vehicles. The Vauxhall Astra, Nissan Qashqai and Mini were among the top 10 sellers.",

It is the only manufacturer of luxury sports cars that isn\u2019t owned by one of the industry giants and was in dire financial straits.</p> <p>Aston is loved and revered in Britain; it is James Bond\u2019s carmaker of choice. And yet, that groundswell of affection has consistently failed to translate into financial success.</p> <p>For much of its 101-year history, Aston has teetered on the brink. Successive owners and chief executives have been hammered by heavy losses \u2013 \u00a325m in 2013 and \u00a336m the year before.</p> <p>Palmer now has six years in which to make Aston profitable and self-financing. He has a \u00a3500m warchest for new products and the company has just raised a further \u00a3200m by issuing preference shares to City investors.</p> <p>\u201cI want to balance the portfolio so we don\u2019t go through this feast and famine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to generate enough cashflow so I don\u2019t have to go out with the begging bowl. The plan is to bring the company to profitability within six years. So that, for the next 100 years, [Aston] won\u2019t go bankrupt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f483b08d8c682f0b52d23bf25c6f6cabd950e9d2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436548817280/efee2658-ac3d-401b-9312-94cec7a0f73c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Aston Martin factory, Gaydon.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Palmer is planning a raft of new product launches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Palmer is clear that Aston Martin must remain firmly rooted in the luxury segment, but it must also spread its wings further than its core sports car market.</p> <p>He is planning a raft of new product launches.

In 1987, Ford bought a majority stake but sold it in 2007 to a consortium including Kuwaiti investors. Then, two years ago, Investindustrial \u2013 an Italian private equity firm that turned around Ducati before selling it to Audi \u2013 snapped up a 37.5% stake.</p> <p>Daimler, the German giant that owns Mercedes, took a 5% stake last year in return for a deal to supply the Midlands producer with engines and electronic technology.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e1af75361badd33191425360caaa6e7502df4c97\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436548923459/a2676755-79f3-48be-87b1-fd3fbc80fe02-460x298.jpeg\" alt=\"Aston Martin factory, Gaydon.\" width=\"460\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aston Martin\u2019s famous wings motif.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Palmer believes this deal could prove crucial in securing Aston\u2019s survival, but denies it is a precursor to a full takeover by the Germans.</p> <p>\u201cIt could happen,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut if I\u2019ve done my job properly, it\u2019s going to be more expensive.

The Menhaden trust will make between 20 and 25 investments, mainly in developed markets, that are likely to include shares in companies and stakes in long-term assets such as infrastructure. Likely business areas include power generation, energy efficiency and storage, and industrial processes, and waste and water management. Goldsmith, 34, is Sir James\u2019s youngest child. His brother, Zac, is a Conservative MP and his sister is the campaigner Jemima Khan. Sir James was known as a ruthless corporate raider but his sons have used their wealth and influence to promote environmental causes. Ben Goldsmith is the founder of WHEB, an investment firm focused on energy efficiency, clean technology and sustainable development . Menhaden will charge investors a 1.25% management fee each year for the first \u00a3150m of investment and 1% on any further amount. There is also a potential 10% performance fee. The trust is open to retail investors who have a professional adviser.",

      "bodyText": "We humans are pretty open to sharing personal information: articles we just read, photos of our dinners, products we love or hate. Yet when it comes to our salaries, most people are too squeamish to divulge the number \u2013 even to a family member. Taking a cue from recruiting platforms such as Glassdoor and Payscale, which publish salaries based on employees\u2019 reviews, some small businesses are finding that making everyone\u2019s paycheck public can eliminate other problems that arise with secrecy. Transparency breeds fairness At the social sharing startup Buffer, chief operating officer Leo Widrich says that back in 2011, when the entire staff included just him and his two cofounders, everyone earned the same amount and knew it. Growth of the business required hiring new people and with it came the question of whether to continue to disclose compensation. For a little while, Widrich asserts, that information was cloaked. As Buffer brought on more new team members, Widrich says, the company decided to be completely open. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want office politics around [salaries],\u201d he says, referring to the inevitable after-hours conversations that occur among colleagues comparing workloads and compensation. To cement the company\u2019s strategy, after its seventh hire, the Buffer team officially laid out its core values, Widrich says. \u201cDefault to transparency\u201d was number two. That didn\u2019t just mean sharing salary information among the staff; it also meant being transparent about the template used to determine how much different positions were paid, as well as the company\u2019s revenue, user numbers and progress reports. In 2014, Buffer\u2019s founding team took transparency to the next level and made all that information available to the public. That kind of transparency \u201cforces leaders to really focus on fairness, as they can\u2019t hide favors,\u201d organizational psychologist Karissa Thacker says. In this way, staffers have a clear sense of their value in comparison to other people. \u201cThey can ask questions regarding what it would take to make [more money],\u201d she says. For Widrich, the most important element of divulging salaries is to seed Buffer\u2019s values as the company grows \u2013 and it has grown steadily since it launched. As of April, Buffer reported it had $6.11m in annual recurring revenue, up from $4.2m in 2014; total users have grown from just over 1.4 million last April up to 2.35 million this year. Staff is now 35 and counting, as new people continue to come on board. Radical transparency also plays a big role in the hiring process. Buffer doesn\u2019t use recruiters, Widrich says. \u201cWe just have people who are interested in joining apply,\u201d he says. That means people tend to self-select initially, based on the company\u2019s explicit values. Widrich says he has heard a lot of people say they don\u2019t want to work at Buffer, especially given that transparency is baked in. \u201cWe are really happy about that,\u201d he says, because it means the team spends less time trying to convert people who might be on the other side of the polarizing issue of transparency. \u201cWe try to be very focused that new people are aligned [with our culture] \u2013 people who already have those values and want to focus on self-improvement and productivity.\u201d Once new hires are on board, Widrich says, Buffer\u2019s retention rate is high. Two people have left to start their own ventures over the course of the company\u2019s four years and another 10 were let go, he says. Taking negotiations off the table When Dane Atkinson started social analytics platform SumAll in 2011, he too was looking for a way to attract and retain talented people. Informed by two decades of experience as a serial entrepreneur, board member, advisor and executive, he was also trying to mitigate several factors that contributed to high turnover of staff at other companies. One was salary negotiation. Another was keeping salaries a secret until someone unwittingly spilled the information. Like the founding team members at Buffer, Atkinson was determined to build openness around these issues right from the beginning. \u201cWe wanted to bind [transparency] into our charter as a defense against later evil,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes the best intentions get misaligned and transparency is an effective handcuff.\u201d This is especially true during the hiring process. Atkinson observes that there are people who clearly dislike the implications of openness around salary, even after he shares his own salary with them. The ones who had the most difficulty with the concept, Atkinson found, were the tough negotiators. Thacker reasons that those who are adept at haggling and getting a better salary could have an impact on the staff after they\u2019re hired. If they\u2019re making more money, they tend to act like they are better than others once on the job, she says. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to reward a good negotiator with a better compensation package if someone more reticent had a better skill set, Atkinson says. \u201cIf [the hiring manager] negotiates them down because they can, that isn\u2019t a great act,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s abusive.\u201d Morale boost or bust Now with 50 employees and 450,000 clients, Atkinson is convinced his move to transparency is working. Only one person has left over compensation issues, bringing SumAll\u2019s turnover rate to less than10% \u2013 compared to what he says is an industry average of over 50% turnover. Although the company doesn\u2019t offer compensation and revenue metrics to the general public like Buffer, \u201cwe can explain to employees why they stand where they stand,\u201d Atkinson says. Discipline around issues like who makes what is typically weak in a lot of small businesses, notes Thacker, so pay transparency needs to come with a clear performance management system. \u201cPeople need regular feedback and that does not happen in small business as formally as it happens in larger businesses,\u201d she says. Atkinson agrees. People often see their salary as \u201ca score that assesses how good they are\u201d. Without regular feedback combined with wage transparency, even those who get a raise could feel like they\u2019ve been undervalued. To compensate, says Atkinson, they might bring more pens or a laptop home. \u201cIn extreme cases they could take the company\u2019s top clients or do something much more impactful to the business,\u201d Atkinson cautions. Recent research bears this out. In one experiment, some individuals were paid lower rates to participate in a psychological experiment than others. When those people found out what the others were earning, they were more likely to cheat. The murky side of openness Such evidence is the reason Joe Silverman, owner of IT service company New York Computer Help, remains cautious about openness. \u201cAlthough we promote full transparency in our in-house practices, as well as to our customers, we do not openly share our salaries,\u201d he says. When salaries are open for discussion, Silverman says, \u201ccoworkers become envious, staff wonder why they are not being valued more, and there is less cohesion due to greed\u201d. There is no strict policy, he says, \u201cwe just mention not to discuss it due to privacy reasons.\u201d But there are no legal parameters around keeping salaries private. Richard C McCrea Jr, a shareholder in Greenberg Traurig\u2019s labor and employment practice, based in Tampa, Florida, notes: \u201cEmployers are not prohibited from implementing a policy of compensation transparency under federal law or under any state laws.\u201d He says transparency exists in the public sector as a by-product of public records laws. McCrea says: \u201cThe decision for most employers is not typically based on legal concerns, but one of management philosophy: does compensation transparency promote improved workplace morale or is it divisive?\u201d Silverman heads off any potential for disgruntled staff by opening up information about bonuses and commissions. \u201cThat is performance-based and promotes a fairly competitive nature that pushes all in a positive and healthy manner,\u201d he says. Atkinson believes that internal transparency is integral to the overall health of a small business. In startup mode, when hires sometimes happen in a hurry to fill critical positions, Atkinson has seen people recruited at a salary 10 times what the position is worth. \u201cIt may seem great in the moment, but then you have this huge skeleton.\u201d That can lead down the rabbit hole of concealing other important information. \u201cIf you are afraid of showing numbers, you are not being fiscally responsible,\u201d he says.",

      "bodyText": "As the east coast of China was put on high alert for the approach of super-typhoon Chan-hom, it was not clear whether the financial storm that has rocked the country\u2019s stock markets had blown itself out. Share prices rebounded to record their best two days since 2008, but many individual investors would still have been nursing big losses after the Shanghai Composite Index plunged nearly a third since its mid-June peak. That plunge came after the index previously jumped by 150% in a year from June 2014 until mid-June this year, drawing in up to 1.4 million new investors every week to bet on soaring prices. The precipitous fall also caused worries it could spill over into the global economy. On Wednesday, before Beijing played its strongest card to stop the rout, Asian shares slid to a 17-month low and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index suffered its worst day since 2008. The Australian dollar fell to a six-year low against the US dollar over fears of the effect on its mining-heavy economy. Playing the stock market has become something of a national pastime in China and 85% of those investing are individuals rather than institutional investors. It is a running joke that no one starts their real job until 3pm, when the markets close. Many of China\u2019s small retail investors have borrowed money to invest as it is relatively easy to do so under the system known as margin financing. Investment bank Credit Suisse estimated that 80% of China\u2019s urban households have put money on the stockmarket in a major shift of household savings from bank accounts to brokerage accounts. Painful losses and panic selling among these millions of small investors has led to concerns about the potential for social instability. \u201cI think social stability is at stake,\u201d said Dong Tao, an economist with Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. \u201cChina has one of the highest ratios for retail investor participation. That is a significant issue and social stability is one of the concerns the government has and why they want to act quickly to stop the panic.\u201d In one of the most drastic of an escalating series of measures, Chinese regulators banned major shareholders in companies from selling their shares for the next six months. Then reports emerged on Friday of police and regulators investigating evidence of potential \u201cmalicious\u201d short selling of Chinese shares \u2013 selling borrowed shares in an attempt to drive down the price and profit by buying the shares back once they have fallen. The rebound, when it came, was dramatic, but Dong was cautious about the longer term effect. It will take some time before anyone can say Beijing\u2019s action has been successful. \u201cWhether the measures are big enough, strong enough to stop the panic, I don\u2019t know. But the government has shown a strong determination to make it work.\u201d There has been debate about whether the government should have taken any action at all. \u201cThey have staked their political credibility on something that they may be able to do, which I think is unwise because I don\u2019t think it was necessary,\u201d said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management. Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University, said the authorities may have exacerbated the crisis with heavy handed action. \u201cPeople in China got a lot more scared because of what the government is doing. They took a small problem and acted on it and made it a bigger problem,\u201d he said. There has been criticism of Beijing\u2019s tactics in the media, with the highly regarded Caixin magazine publishing an opinion piece that argued only a systemic risk that threatened financial stability justified a government bailout. \u201cGovernment intervention disturbs the price discovery process because it unifies investor expectations and encourages them to make the same choice,\u201d the magazine said. \u201cIn this scenario, investing becomes gambling on the government\u2019s actions.\u201d Many analysts believe the dizzying rise of share prices over recent months made them overvalued.

The massive gains in the markets in the past year came at a time when growth has been slowing to its weakest pace since before the financial crisis. Chen Jiahe, chief strategist with Cinda Securities, said a stock market crash did not pose an immediate threat to the wider Chinese economy and did not believe China was heading for a meltdown similar to the US crunch that precipitated a global financial crisis in 2008. \u201cThe leveraging in China\u2019s equity market is still quite low compared to the leveraging in most other markets like the United States, especially when you compare it with the [US] sub prime crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis,\u201d Chen said.

It is too early to quantify how it is going to effect consumption.\u201d \u201cThere is an enormous amount of fear in the market,\u201d said Balding. \u201cAs long as there is that level of fear in the marketplace and that level of fear among policymakers, that is not the type of atmosphere that is going to promote a sustainable recovery,\u201d he added.",

On Wednesday, before Beijing played its strongest card to stop the rout, Asian shares slid to a 17-month low and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index suffered its worst day since 2008. The Australian dollar fell to a six-year low against the US dollar over fears of the effect on its mining-heavy economy.</p> <p>Playing the stock market has become something of a national pastime in China and 85% of those investing are individuals rather than institutional investors.

That is a significant issue and social stability is one of the concerns the government has and why they want to act quickly to stop the panic.\u201d</p> <p>In one of the most drastic of an escalating series of measures, Chinese regulators banned major shareholders in companies from selling their shares for the next six months. Then reports emerged on Friday of police and regulators investigating evidence of potential \u201cmalicious\u201d short selling of Chinese shares \u2013 selling borrowed shares in an attempt to drive down the price and profit by buying the shares back once they have fallen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/china-stock-market-crisis-explained\">Why is China's stock market in crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rebound, when it came, was dramatic, but Dong was cautious about the longer term effect.

The provisional support for a deal is likely to come ahead of a formal meeting of all 19 eurozone finance ministers on Saturday, which will consider the package of measures, and an emergency summit of EU leaders on Sunday. The hope in Athens appeared to be that its capitulation to demands for \u20ac13bn (\u00a39.36bn) of public spending cuts and reforms would bring a commitment from Brussels for a third bailout, the promise of debt relief, and crucially for an economy on its knees, a flood of cash into its banking system from the European Central Bank. Industrial production figures on Friday showed that Greek output fell 4% during May, compared with 0.4% growth in April, underling how far and fast the economy slumped as the debate over a creditor bailout dragged on. Stock markets raced ahead across Europe and Greek borrowing costs improved on the international bond markets following messages of support from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and comments by the EU president, Donald Tusk, that a deal could be reached to save Greece from crashing out of the eurozone. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was in parliament seeking the backing of MPs for the deal, with several of his supporters playing down the possibility of a major split in his own radical leftist party, Syriza. In the 13-page document sent to Greece\u2019s creditors on Thursday night, Tsipras outlined plans for severe cuts on hitherto protected privileges such as pensions, tax breaks for the country\u2019s islands and limits on military spending.

Chris Weston of IG said: \u201cThe Greek public voted against austerity last Sunday, yet what we have seen is a giant step closer towards the creditors\u2019 prior proposal which was subsequently rejected, ironically by Tsipras.\u201d German leaders also expressed surprise at the scale of the climbdown by Tsipras and the likelihood that a third bailout could put the Greek economy on a sustainable footing.

      "bodyText": "Oil prices have not reached rock bottom and could continue falling well into next year, according to the west\u2019s energy watchdog. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said there was a growing glut of crude on world markets, while it expected demand to slow next year. \u201cThe bottom of the market may still be ahead,\u201d the IEA said in its monthly report. The forecast will come as a welcome boost to the UK and other major importing countries that benefited from falling oil prices since last summer only to see them tick upwards during the spring. Economists have estimated that cheaper fuel put \u00a310 a week back in the pockets of the average UK household and helped spur a modest increase in consumer spending combined with an accelerated pace of mortgage repayment. The IEA forecast global demand growth to be 1.2m barrels per day (bpd) next year, down from 1.4m this year and far less than needed to balance growing supply. \u201cThe rebalancing that began when oil markets set off on an initial 60% price drop a year ago has yet to run its course. Recent developments suggest that the process will extend well into 2016,\u201d it said. \u201cThe oil market was massively oversupplied in the second quarter of 2015, and remains so today. It is equally clear that the market\u2019s ability to absorb that oversupply is unlikely to last. Onshore storage space is limited. So is the tanker fleet \u2026 something has to give.\u201d The global glut arose from a spike in US oil supply on the back of shale exploration and Opec\u2019s decision not to reduce output but rather fight for market share with rival producers. But the fall in prices to $50-$60 (\u00a332-\u00a338) a barrel in recent months from a high of $115 a year ago has yet to depress North American supply. \u201cThe expected timing of the rebalancing has shifted a bit, but the storyline has not changed. The supply response to lower prices is on the way,\u201d the IEA said, adding that it may take another price drop for a full supply response to unfold. \u201cCost savings, efficiency gains and producer hedging have let light tight oil producers defy expectations until now, but growth ground to a halt in May and will likely stay there through mid-2016.\u201d US supply grew by 1m bpd in the first five months of 2015, down from 1.8m in 2014, according to the IEA. \u201cTotal US supply will keep growing through 2016, but much more slowly than in 2014, and thanks to natural gas liquids and new deepwater plays rather than onshore crude supply,\u201d it said. Non-Opec supply as a whole, after expanding by a massive 2.4m bpd in 2014, looks on track to slow to growth of 1m bpd in 2015 and stay flat in 2016, the IEA said. The IEA said world oil demand growth appeared to have peaked in the first quarter of 2015 at 1.8m bpd and would continue to ease throughout the rest of this year and into next. That means the need for OPEC\u2019s oil will stand at 30.3m bpd next year, up 1mon 2015, but still a whopping 1.4m below current Opec production. \u201cAnd the group is not slowing down,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cOn the contrary, its core Middle East producers are pumping at record rates and the outlook for Iraqi capacity growth \u2013 accounting for most projected Opec expansions \u2013 keeps improving.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has ended its long-running feud with Aer Lingus by agreeing to sell a stake in its rival Irish airline to the parent of British Airways. Ryanair said its board had voted unanimously to accept International Airlines Group\u2019s offer for Ryanair\u2019s 29.8% share of Aer Lingus. Ryanair first bought a stake in Aer Lingus nine years ago and has tried to buy the company several times. IAG\u2019s \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31bn) offer looked set to succeed in May when the Irish government agreed to sell its 25% stake in Aer Lingus but Ryanair, whose attempts to buy the carrier were blocked on competition grounds, remained a potential obstacle. Michael O\u2019Leary, Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe believe the IAG offer for Aer Lingus is a reasonable one in the current market and we plan to accept it, in the best interests of Ryanair shareholders. The price means that Ryanair will make a small profit on its investment in Aer Lingus.\u201d In an apparent putdown of IAG\u2019s deal, O\u2019Leary said Ryanair now had no need to buy Aer Lingus because since 2013 his company had established itself at primary European airports. Ryanair had originally wanted to use Aer Lingus\u2019s presence at primary airports to compete for mid-price flights against flag-carrier airlines, he said. O\u2019Leary said: \u201cWe wish IAG well with their takeover of Aer Lingus. When Ryanair first bid for Aer Lingus in late 2006, Ryanair [36 million passengers] carried four times Aer Lingus\u2019s traffic [9 million]. Today Ryanair [over 100 million] carries more than 10 times Aer Lingus\u2019s traffic [10 million], and we will continue to deliver the vast majority of Ireland\u2019s traffic and tourism growth in the coming months and years.\u201d The European Union will approve IAG\u2019s takeover of Aer Lingus after IAG made further concessions on competition grounds, Reuters reported. IAG has offered to give up some London airport slots as well as so-called prorate agreements that let airlines carry rivals\u2019 passengers on connecting flights. Willie Walsh, the chairman of IAG, said in May he expected Ryanair to behave rationally and to accept the offer. Ryanair was incensed by the UK competition watchdog\u2019s ruling that it should sell most of its stake in Aer Lingus to leave its rival free to forge alliances.",

      "bodyText": "Part tragedy. Part farce. No happy ending. The final stages of the Greek drama have begun. The tragedy is that there is no end in sight to the suffering of the Greek people. They have seen their country\u2019s economy shrink by 25% in five years and it was already back in recession when the banks closed their doors two weeks ago. The damage caused by the rapid descent into a cashless, semi-barter economy will be profound and long-lasting. It would take months if not years to repair the damage even if pro-growth policies are pursued. That, sadly, will not be the case. Greece now faces a fresh wave of austerity policies \u2013 increases in VAT, public sector wage cuts, less generous pensions \u2013 that will put the brake on activity. This approach has been tried repeatedly over the past five years and it has failed repeatedly. It will fail again. Greece is like Sisyphus, the king of Corinth who according to legend angered the gods and was condemned to push an enormous rock to the top of a hill. When Sisyphus neared the summit, the boulder would slip from his grasp and tumble back down to the bottom of the slope, forcing him to start again. Alexis Tsipras, too, has angered the gods, in this case the European commission, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and most of the 18 other countries that are members of the single currency. His punishment for his five-month show of defiance will be to have Greece\u2019s boulder replaced by an even bigger one. For this is where the tragedy turns to farce. The terms Tsipras is now willing to accept are actually more severe than the ones he rejected two weeks ago. This was the moment in Brussels when the Greek prime minister stunned the rest of Europe by putting the terms on offer to a referendum. It looked a bold, even foolhardy move. The ECB capped its emergency support to Greece\u2019s banks. Limits were put on cash withdrawals of \u20ac60 a day. As the economy came to a halt, every European leader warned that a no vote in the referendum rejecting the austerity package was effectively a vote to leave the single currency. Yet, despite everything, Greece voted no by a landslide. Tsipras asked for a mandate and got it. But if he thought this would force the creditors to offer concessions, he was wrong. The choice faced by his government this week has been stark: surrender or leave the euro. He has chosen to hoist the white flag over the Parthenon. Greeks will be asking today what has been the point of the last month of diplomatic theatre: the endless meetings, the violent rhetoric, the walkouts, and the calling of the referendum. The answer is less than nothing. Untold damage has been caused to the Greek economy for no purpose whatsoever. Tsipras is a much-diminished figure as a result of the events of the last two weeks, and ought to pay a heavy political price. So what happens now? In theory, there is a chance that the euro group \u2013 the conclave of finance ministers from the single currency \u2013 could say that the Greek surrender is not yet abject enough. They could ask for still further punitive measures before recommending that Greece be allowed to remain part of the club. That, though, is not going to happen. There is much political pressure, both internal and external, to keep the euro intact. Greece might only represent a tiny fraction of the European economy, but its departure from the single currency would symbolise the failure of the project and set a precedent. The US has been putting pressure on Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to ensure there is no Grexit. Greece will also get some debt relief. That\u2019s not because the creditors think they owe Tsipras something. On the contrary, he has destroyed most of the goodwill that previously existed. But it is clear to everybody that Greece\u2019s debt outlook is unsustainable and becoming more so. Debts are already 175% of gross domestic product and the economy is going backwards. Shutting the banks for a fortnight makes matters worse. Even the hardliners in Germany recognise that something must be done. Debt relief, though, is unlikely to be generous enough to make much of a difference. Greece will stay in the euro but the tax increases and the wage cuts will not deliver the promised economic recovery. A third bailout package will be no more successful than the past two. When the next episode in the crisis arrives, as it will, Greeks will look back to the moment when their government had the choice between austerity and the euro and wonder whether it made the right one.",

      "bodyText": "Model railway enthusiasts will soon be able to pick up online orders from Hornby at real-life railway stations. Hornby, best known for its replica train sets, has signed a deal to let customers collect their orders from shops at stations. The shops are run by Doddle, whose 35 outlets target busy commuters who want to receive, return or send parcels from stations. The deal will allow model rail hobbyists to pick up their items while experiencing actual delays, penalty fares and aromas emanating from fast-food outlets. Doddle is part of a network run by DPD, a parcel delivery company that will also take items to customers\u2019 homes or let them collect their goods at retailers. Doddle\u2019s shops in stations are mainly in London and south-east England but it also has branches in Manchester, Glasgow and Birmingham. Richard Ames, Hornby\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe delivery of these projects will strengthen our business model and ultimately benefit our customers. With Doddle as a partner, enthusiasts will have the convenience of being able to collect their model train purchases from a major train station near them.\u201d Hornby, which also makes Airfix, Corgi and Scalextric, supplies hundreds of independent model shops and sells direct to customers. It returned to profit for the first time in three years last year. Ames has set up a separate digital team to improve services and systems to attract more online business. Click-and-collect services, which let customers order online and pick up items from shops or other locations, have grown in popularity in recent years. This article has been amended to make clear that Doddle is an independent company.",

With Doddle as a partner, enthusiasts will have the convenience of being able to collect their model train purchases from a major train station near them.\u201d</p> <p>Hornby, which also makes Airfix, Corgi and Scalextric, supplies hundreds of independent model shops and sells direct to customers. It <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/01/hornby-on-track-make-profit-toys\">returned to profit for the first time in three years</a> last year. </p> <p>Ames has set up a separate digital team to improve services and systems to attract more online business. Click-and-collect services, which let customers order online and pick up items from shops or other locations, have grown in popularity in recent years.</p> <p>This article has been amended to make clear that Doddle is an independent company. </p>",

      "bodyText": "You launched Net-a-Porter 15 years ago from a small studio in London\u2019s Chelsea. How has it changed? When we launched in 2000, we used American English to make us sound international and signed all our correspondence from \u201cthe Editors\u201d, even though it was really just me and a couple of others packing the black boxes with clothes and ribbon bows. We were serving women who had access to a computer Monday to Friday: there would be a surge on Monday lunchtimes, then again last minute on a Friday. In those days, you had to unplug your home phone to get online, and you could drink a whole cup of coffee while a webpage uploaded. I do feel like I am reminiscing about a time when we had to milk our cows and make our own cheese. Now, we have 6 million unique visitors each month, sell more than 390 fashion brands 24/7 via mobile platforms and express ship to 170 countries worldwide. What do you know about your customers? Online browsing and shopping offers lots of data on our customers that you don\u2019t get in offline stores: their sizes, their colour preferences, browsing patterns, shopping habits, average spend, the times they shop \u2013 it\u2019s very common for women to make a purchase last thing at night from their smartphone in bed. We recommend products and designers they might like, based on purchase history or labels they \u201cfollow\u201d. Do your customers want to see what they\u2019d look like wearing things, perhaps with an avatar? No. Our consumers don\u2019t like gimmicks. They don\u2019t want things to spin around the screen or pop up. We\u2019ve discovered they want good, honest words and really great photos that show full-length details. The majority want to be left alone and like self-service, but a small percentage of women treat technology as a conduit to old-world service and use our trained personal shoppers and customer care team as they might do in a traditional bricks-and-mortar boutique. How have shopping habits evolved? Female fashion consumers are always looking for something new, while we\u2019ve learned with Mr Porter (the men\u2019s fashion site launched in 2011) that guys tend to want more of what they already have. Women love the thrill of discovering new labels and being the first to wear them in their social set, so we are really developing our own curated collection of fledgling labels alongside the big established fashion names and now sell over 120 beauty brands. British designers have really enjoyed massive success and power in recent years, thanks to the reach of the internet. Technology shrinks and expands at the same time: we launched PORTER, our glossy shoppable print magazine in February 2014, because our customers enjoy 360-degree immersive experiences. You\u2019ve just launched the Net Set, a social media app offering users the chance to create and join style tribes and follow other shoppers. Are you playing catchup in the social media arena? I wanted to purpose-build something for the mobile generation, so I briefed our team by saying, \u201cwhat if there were a company out there setting up in competition with us, to be a modern multi-brand experience on mobile?\u201d I asked the team to disrupt Net-a-Porter, rather than have someone else disrupt us. The Net Set is invitation-only at the moment, but the figures already prove it\u2019s engaging as a shopping experience. We went from having a very controlled, one-way conversation with our customers, where we dictated what product was important, to saying \u201cOK guys, now you create your own Net-a-Porter.\u201d For a social network to work, you need a critical mass of users who set the boundaries. Then when you open the doors to the public, which we plan to do in the autumn, they arrive at a party that\u2019s in full swing, rather than a party that hasn\u2019t yet started. Your native language is fashion. Are you now bilingual and speak fluent tech, too? I can say API (application programming interface), and I can say Java, but I don\u2019t feel entirely comfortable in the tech world. My family make fun of me as sometimes I can\u2019t turn on the TV. I don\u2019t understand why we need two remote controls. When we have an idea [at work], I trust the team to develop something to meet the brief: I don\u2019t need to know the language. At 50, do you keep pace with evolving digital life? I have one foot on the dock, and one on the boat of technology, and I am going to make the massive leap on to the boat and embrace it. Am I navigating social and mobile in the same way my 15-year-old does? No. It is frightening and inspiring in the same breath. However, I admire my parents for listening to my music. I want to take the time to invest myself in new consumer habits. It would be suicide not to. I believe we must never fall in love with the way we are doing things, but we must always focus on what our consumers want. How do you spend your money? Net-a-Porter. I shop just like anyone else. I can\u2019t help myself. I use Deliveroo, (a premium restaurant delivery service) and Flowerbx for seasonal cut flowers. Amazon gets a tremendous amount of my money for books, gardening equipment and all that functional stuff. Very few of my purchases are made offline, because I don\u2019t have time to walk round stores, and I hate going into stores in my raggedy jeans and seeing an assistant sneer at me. I love the way the internet has democratized shopping. What are your guilty pleasures when it comes to online habits? Instagram. It\u2019s genius, truly life changing. And I am obsessed with all the property sites, such as Rightmove, StreetEasy and Trulia, which are all geo-location based. I love zooming in and out of cities I\u2019ve never been to and comparing real estate. I was walking through London the other day with my dog and turned on Rightmove so I could see what was for sale in that area. Are you permanently connected? Some of my favourite things to do are connected with digital, for example, looking at pictures from my friends in California on Instagram, or coveting crazy properties online. I am connected because I want to be, not by obligation. It\u2019s such a treat to live in these times, enjoying that voyage of discovery when you listen to a favourite track by Led Zeppelin and then get recommended contemporary artists that you might like, because of clever algorithms. My daughter has introduced me to Snapchat, but I only have her on my list. There is not a moment in our household where Snapchat isn\u2019t going crazy \u2013 all her schoolfriends see me in my pyjamas at my kitchen table everyday. I do read old-fashioned magazines and books, though. The most I disconnect from the digital world is looking at the stars \u2026 but that\u2019s being connected to the world in a different way. Where is the digital age taking us? There is the view that we are all going to hell in a handcart and it is the destruction of society and privacy and civilised human contact. But I am optimistic and choose to look at it as an incredible opportunity for transparency, knowledge, empathy, understanding and a platform for creativity. It will take us from being employees to having the potential to lead our own lives on our own terms. Once an egg-cup painter would work in isolation, in their own little space, but now they can connect that niche with an audience all over the world and that is so exciting. We can go back to enjoying a sense of community, albeit with a different shape to the traditional one, where people with shared interests can connect, wherever they are. I am not sure how education in schools can keep up with the information children have at their fingertips. The speed with which things can be done makes it challenging within traditional forms of education.",

It\u2019s such a treat to live in these times, enjoying that voyage of discovery when you listen to a favourite track by Led Zeppelin and then get recommended contemporary artists that you might like, because of clever algorithms.</p> <p>My daughter has introduced me to <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com\">Snapchat</a>, but I only have her on my list. There is not a moment in our household where Snapchat isn\u2019t going crazy \u2013 all her schoolfriends see me in my pyjamas at my kitchen table everyday.</p> <p>I do read old-fashioned magazines and books, though. The most I disconnect from the digital world is looking at the stars \u2026 but that\u2019s being connected to the world in a different way.</p> <p><strong>Where is the digital age taking us?</strong></p> <p>There is the view that we are all going to hell in a handcart and it is the destruction of society and privacy and civilised human contact. But I am optimistic and choose to look at it as an incredible opportunity for transparency, knowledge, empathy, understanding and a platform for creativity. It will take us from being employees to having the potential to lead our own lives on our own terms. Once an egg-cup painter would work in isolation, in their own little space, but now they can connect that niche with an audience all over the world and that is so exciting. We can go back to enjoying a sense of community, albeit with a different shape to the traditional one, where people with shared interests can connect, wherever they are.</p> <p>I am not sure how education in schools can keep up with the information children have at their fingertips. The speed with which things can be done makes it challenging within traditional forms of education.</p>",
