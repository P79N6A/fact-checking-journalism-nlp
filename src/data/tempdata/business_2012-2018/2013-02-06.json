      "bodyText": "The Libor interest-rate scandal dates back to 2005. Little known outside the City, it underpinned trillions of pounds worth of loans, mortgages and financial contracts in Europe and the US. Regulators have already imposed \u00a31.7bn of fines on a string of the world's biggest banks, while police are pursuing criminal investigations into staff involved in rigging the rates to suit their employers. 2005 Between January 2005 and June 2009, Barclays derivatives traders made a total of 257 requests to fix Libor and Euribor rates. Initially, traders sought to inflate the bank lending rate to boost profits \u2013 and their own bonuses. 2007 After Northern Rock collapses, Barclays submits artificially low rates to give a healthier picture of its ability to raise funds. In a phone call in December, a Barclays employee tells the New York Fed that the Libor rate was being fixed at a level that was unrealistically low. 2008 In April the New York Fed queries a Barclays employee over Libor reporting. The Wall Street Journal publishes the first article questioning the integrity of Libor. Following the WSJ report, Barclays is contacted by the British Bankers' Association over concerns about the accuracy of its Libor submissions. Later in the year, the Fed meets to begin inquiry. Fed boss Tim Geithner gives Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King a note listing proposals to tackle Libor problems. 2009 A year on, the BBA issues guidelines for setting Libor rates. 2010 In June, Barclays makes first effort to clamp down on Libor manipulation in email setting out standards of behaviour. 2011 Royal Bank of Scotland sacks four people for their alleged roles in the emerging Libor-fixing scandal. 2012 22 June Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond learns of emails sent by dodgy traders. He later says reading them made him feel \"physically ill\". 27 June Barclays admits misconduct. Regulators fine it \u00a3360m. 29 June Diamond insists he will not resign. July Barclays chairman Marcus Agius and Diamond resign, followed by chief operating officer Jerry del Missier. The prime minister, David Cameron, announces a review of the banking sector, sets up Banking Commission. Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launches a criminal inquiry into Libor manipulation. Deutsche Bank confirms that a \"limited number\" of staff were involved in the Libor rate-rigging scandal. It clears senior management. SFO arrests three men in connection with investigations into Libor. Swiss bank UBS is fined \u00a3940m by US, UK and Swiss regulators. 2013 January Barclays' new boss, Antony Jenkins, tells staff to sign up to a new code of conduct \u2013 or leave the firm \u2013 in clean-up operation.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies said tax rises of \u00a310bn-12bn might be needed in the next parliament to put deficit reduction back on track and to avoid \"eye-watering\" cuts in some Whitehall departments that would reduce spending by a third in inflation-adjusted terms between 2010 and 2018.

Johnson said the need to continue the austerity programme into the next parliament had been caused by George Osborne's decision to allow borrowing to rise while the economy has moved sideways over the past two years, rather than tighten policy further. That decision was praised on Wednesday by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in its annual survey of Britain, which said a more modest pace of deficit reduction was warranted given the poor performance of the economy. Admitting it had over-estimated the strength of Britain's recovery from its longest and deepest post-war recession, the OECD said a \"flexible approach\" to budget cuts would be called for if fears of a triple-dip recession materialised. \"The fiscal stance [the strategy to cut Britain's record peacetime budget deficit] remains appropriate.

This economic failure is why George Osborne is now being forced to find further spending cuts and tax rises.\" The IFS said the government decision to ringfence spending on the NHS, international development and part of the schools' budget had resulted in other departments \u2013 such as the Home Office and Justice \u2013 facing real cuts of 20% in the current spending round. A continuation of the ringfencing until 2018 would result in unprotected budgets being cut by 33% while public sector employment would be 1.2m lower than in 2010.

The most important part of that is focusing our efforts on the needs of our customers and acting with integrity. And it also involves facing up to the Bank\u2019s past failings, no matter how uncomfortable that is. That is why those responsible have left the organisation or been subject to disciplinary action. The Board has also used all means possible to ensure the gravity of this issue is reflected in the remuneration received by employees. No one should be left in any doubt about how seriously RBS takes these failings.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough this wrongdoing went undetected for longer than we would have wished, in this and across all risk areas we are working hard to root out bad practices and put them right for the future.

We condemn the behaviour of the individuals who sought to influence some LIBOR currency settings at our bank from 2006-10. There is no place at RBS for such behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also determined to correct the broad range of control and risk management failures that originated in RBS during the financial boom years. LIBOR manipulation is one example. This is a painstaking task undertaken carefully and diligently over five years. We know that we cannot detect and solve every problem as fast as we would like. But our commitment is absolute. We are dedicated to creating a safe and secure RBS that serves customers well and that, in the right way, creates value for those who rely on us.</p> <p>\u201cLIBOR manipulation is an extreme example of a selfish and self-serving culture that took hold in parts of the banking industry during the financial boom. We will use the lessons learned from this episode as further motivation to reject and change the vestiges of that culture. RBS is making substantial progress overall. Today's announcement is not the first and will not be the last reminder of the scale of the changes that need to be made.

Thanks for all the comments in in the readers' section below. Several of you are focused on the issue of potential criminal cases against those involved. williewasp18 compares the issue to the rioting that hit Britain in summer 2011, writing: Nick a 50p bottle of water in a riot in Tottenham = within days a huge fine in relation to their benefits and 3 months in a young offenders institution and demonised for the rest of their lives. An anonymous trader committing a fraudulent act that affects the whole British Economy and attracts the attention of regulators around the world and a fine that could bankrupt a small country = Little or no action, no naming and shaming, no criminal prosecution. heir top Manager paid an extraordinary remittance for supervising this charade walks away with a years salary but looses his obscene bonus as he did not have any knowledge of what his trader was doing sorry that's why he was paid so much. There was no excuse for the Riots in Tottenham and there is no excuse for the delay of criminal prosecutions in the LIBOR scandal. Strummered isn't impressed that such antics took place at a bank now largely owned by the taxpayer: So in essence the British taxpayer is being fined for the illegal practices of RBS (majority owned by the UK taxpayer), great. While CityActuary is more sanguine, saying: The uk government chose to purchase the bank. With any acquisition there is going to be the risk that things like this could subsequently come out. To some extent it will have been priced in - we knew what type of institution we were buying... And Scurra sees the big picture: This exposes the other seriously critical flaw in our wonderful \"free market capitalist\" system - that illegal activity penalised through fines simply ends up being paid by the customer in higher charges/prices (or sometimes, if the circumstances are right, like this one, the shareholders if there is no prospect of them getting away.) We've pulled together some of the key quotes from today: RBS Libor-rigging scandal: in quotes Some of tonight's headlines don't make easy reading for RBS. The Times writes: \"Sushi and sex revealed as RBS Libor-riggers\u2019 currency\" as it romps through some of the exchanges between traders (see here). While the Financial Times focuses on the fact that one of the bank\u2019s Asian subsidiaries pleading guilty to a US criminal charge as part of today's settlement: The bank\u2019s RBS Securities Japan subsidiary will plead guilty to a criminal charge of wire fraud filed by the DoJ, the bank said in a statement. The subsidiary will pay $50m of the total fine, according to the DoJ. And in the Telegraph, Harry WIlson argues that libor-fixing should be treated like doping in professional cycling: If RBS and other banks are truly to put this scandal behind them they must drop this approach and take a leaf out of the Team Sky reaction to doping, where anyone with the slightest link to past misbehaviour has been asked to leave to remove all taint from the organisation. Perhaps if this were to happen, the banking industry might finally be able to begin rebuilding its reputation. Until then, all the apologies and admissions look about as convincing as Lance Armstrong\u2019s interview with Oprah Winfrey. Enraged by the revelations of Libor-rigging by some RBS traders? Want to know how it could happen, and what happens now? Care to ask the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland himself what's going on? Well, here's your chance. Sir Philip Hampton will be taking part in a live Question-And-Answer session on the Guardian website on Thursday, starting at 12.30pm GMT (or 7.30am if you're on the East Coast of America). He will answer questions on the \u00a3390m ($612m) fine - and you can start posting them now, here: Libor-rigging scandal: post your questions for RBS chairman Despite today's damaging revelations, shares in Royal Bank of Scotland actually finished 1.3% higher today at 342.1p, up 4.6p. That reflects the fact that the fine has been well anticipated -- RBS has been negotiating the details for many weeks. The issue can now stop clouding RBS's outlook. However... Ian Gordon, city analyst at Investec, continues to recommend investors sell their shares: Given weak (or negative) loan growth in many of its \u201ccore\u201d businesses \u2013 primarily a function of the weak macro backdrop \u2013 we continue to see a very slow pace of recovery. Fitch, the ratings agency, comments that the RBS Libor fine underlines \"the regulatory and reputation risks facing global and trading banks\". It also predicts that the (bad) conduct of some RBS staffers could continue to dog the group this year: RBS's strategy to significantly reduce its markets operations should reduce these risks in the future, but conduct costs are likely to remain across the group in the short term. The potential for lasting damage to individual franchises as a result of the Libor scandal is unclear. More UK politicians have weighed in on the RBS Libor fine (perhaps aware that no-one ever lost votes for kicking a banker). For the opposition, Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s shadow Treasury minister, said: This is a serious setback for RBS on its road to recovery, and another stain on the reputation of UK banking. This isn\u2019t just a case of excessive risk-taking by investment bankers \u2013 it is about the corrupt manipulation of what should have been a trustworthy and independent interest rate. How much more evidence does the Chancellor need before agreeing to radical reforms of our banking system? Yet again we see an appalling saga of interest rate fixing ranging across the whole industry, but the government still refuses to take a backstop power for full separation of all the banks in case ring-fencing doesn\u2019t work. We should note that much of the Libor rigging took place while the previous Labour government was in power, and the regulatory regime it brought in. Leslie added that the UK needs better protection for whistle-blowers across industry. Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Stephen Williams also weighed in, calling for offenders to be banished from the City: My constituents and those around the country will be disgusted by the reckless behaviour of those involved in yet another banking scandal. After their jobs were saved by the public bail out, bankers at RBS acted with impunity to manipulate the market and I will be campaigning strongly to have them struck off. They should never again be able to work in the UK\u2019s banking sector so that the public does not again pay the price for their outrageous behaviour. I will discuss what can be done with my colleagues on the Parliamentary Commission into Banking who are looking at professional standards in banking. Dr Nick Motso of Cass Business School reckons RBS learned some lessons from the way Barclays handled its own Libor failings: RBS senior management have clearly learned from the fallout following the Barclays settlement and are at pains to point out that realise how serious the problem was and are determined not only to punish those responsible but also make sure something like this can never happen again Motso also argues that John Hourican could be seen, by some, as a sacrificial lamb, as the head of RBS's investment division shuffles off without his bonus: I feel some sympathy for Mr Hourican who in the words of RBS \u201chad no involvement in or knowledge of the misconduct\u201d and is now approximately \u00a34m worse off. He was being paid \u00a3700,000 per year to take responsibility for an incredibly complex organisation and his achievements in streamlining the business have been startling, however there is evidence of manipulation of LIBOR as recently as 2010 so he has to accept some responsibility which he has done, and by resigning he has done the honourable thing. My colleague Heidi Moore, our US business and economics editor, puts her finger on one part of the RBS scandal left unaddressed: the terrible grammar and punctuation. She writes: It used to be that evil finance plots at least had the dignity to be conducted in back rooms, with much mustache-twirling and fondling of watch fobs as well as hearty, if ominous laughs. There were masterminds and winks. There was an implicit understanding, when power was being abused, that by God, it would be done right. No longer. The RBS emails and chats show us that there has been a disgraceful lowering of standards when it comes to malignant scheming. Consider this dastardly request to fix an interest rate that is disappointingly underscored with...a winky face emoticon. Broker B: gotcha, thanks, and, if u cud see ur [sic] way to a small drop there might be a steak in it for ya, haha Primary Submitter B: noted ;-) I think we can agree that this lacks, at the very least, a sense of occasion. Seconded. Heidi is also unimpressed by one of the more eye-catching pieces of banter -- the indecisive trader who described himself as \"like a whores drawers\". Come on, boys! This is not a late-night booty call; this is an attempt to steal money from the pockets of investors by manufacturing the levels of an important interest rate! Look spiffy, won't you? And find the apostrophe key. Those references to bribes of steaks and spare sushi (see here) also fail to match the Barclays trader who pledged \"a bottle of Bollinger\" after one libor fixing episode: This is setting entirely too little temptation. Unless the bottle was a Bollinger Les Vieilles Vignes Francaises, which retails for $300 ($650 for the 1997 vintage) - or a Shipwrecked 1907 Heidseick at $275,000 - it's likely that the trader planned to spend no more than $70-$100 on his erstwhile co-conspirator. This is not very much return at all for a potential bonus payment at the end of the year that would number in the millions of pounds. This bespeaks a horrible level of entitlement. Those Wash Trades (see previous post) were also used to allow traders at other banks to feed commissions to brokers, according to the FSA. Its Final Notice (online here) includes an exchange (p18-19) between two traders who have discovered that they've blundered over how to book a pair of wash trades into the electronic trade confirmation network, called SwapsWire. The language shows quite how concerned they got - no jokes about free lunch this time: Derivatives Trader B: \u2026it\u2019s going to be highlighted as two identical trades [going in and out of SwapsWire]. Broker A: Oh, right. Fuck. Derivatives Trader B: So now they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Why have we got\u2026 [Panel Bank 1] in and out on SwapsWire and not booked it?\u2019 So now the whole bank\u2019s going to see the trade. Broker A: Yeah, shit. I don\u2019t\u2026there\u2019s no way we can get this out and put back in again is there\u2026 Derivatives Trader B: I\u2019m gonna\u2026I\u2019m going\u2026I\u2019m going to book mine not as SwapsWire. Broker A: Okay. So it\u2019s not going to matter on mine, is it? Derivatives Trader B: I don\u2019t\u2026I\u2019ve got no idea, mate. This will be a fucking disaster now. Broker A: Oh fuck. Okay. However, it wasn't a disaster for the pair. RBS never noticed.... The FSA's final notice against RBS explains that traders used Wash Trades -- where identical buy and sell orders are executed simultaneously to generate dodgy commission -- to reward the brokers who executed their requests. It found that RBS failed to spot at least 30 wash trades between September 2008 and August 2009. Those trades saw RBS pay a minimum of \u00a3211,000 to at least two broker firms. Another revealing exchange between RBS traders: George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, has blasted those responsible for Libor rate-fixing at RBS. Osborne also reminded reporters in London that he should take the credit for pinning the cost of the fine on the RBS bonus pool [having used the muscle provided by the taxpayer's 82% stake in the bank]. Osborne said: What happened at RBS and other banks is totally unacceptable At my insistence, the bankers, not the taxpayers, will pick up the bill. Those people who did wrong will face the full force of the law... In 2013 our reforms are turning people's anger into a positive force for change. Press conference now over. Final question is a gem - where's the next fine coming from? Hester replies that RBS is involved in certain investigations (such as the US money laundering probe mentioned here). These things, though, often come out of the blue, he adds. This might be the take-away quote from the RBS board. Sir Philip Hampton says that he doesn't seen the need for \"multiple\" casualties at or near the top of the bank \"for the sake of blood on the carpet\". Hampton, who like Hester joined the bank after it careered into public ownership after the financial crisis struck, was asked for his opinion of the previous management. He sounded less than impressed - pointing out that when a bank comes close to going bust (requiring a huge intervention by the British taxpayer), there been a pretty severe failure of control. On the issue of future action -- Hampton said it was too early to say how much RBS might have to pay for fixing Euribor -- the rate for borrowing in euros. Hester adds that the company could see regulatory action from Japan and Switzerland in the future. Harry Wilson of the Telegraph seeks more details on the bonuses that have been recovered over the issue. Hampton won't give numerical details, but explains that RBS is regularly recovering payments from previous years: We've done quite a lot of clawback in the last couple of years, on a variety of issues. Which goes back to Stephen Hester's point about his big job cleaning up RBS. Won't staff simply walk out the door because they have seen their bonuses swiped from under their noses, thanks to the intervention of George Osborne (who laid down the law on Monday)? Philip Hampton reckons RBS will cope: We have challenges, but sometimes they are overstated - by the media and politicians, he says, adding: There are very few examples of even attempts of the government intervening in the day-to-day running of the bank. Anyone caught fixing a sporting match would go to jail, points out another journalist (sorry to be vague, I've dialed into the call). RBS's response: bonus pools are there as an incentive for staff, and it's right that it should be tapped to cover misdeeds by some staff Will top executives at RBS see their bonuses clawed back? Hampton says the bank is \"thinking about\" launching action to recover payments to ex-directors. But for the avoidance of doubt, he adds, the board is not considering clawing back the bonus handed to Stephen Hester for 2012. It's the only bonus he's received, points out Hampton, who sounded somewhat guilty about this [Hester's 2012 bonus went up in flames when RBS's IT systems failed last summer. while a \u00a31.6m bonus for 2009 was waived amid concern over the bank's huge losses that year) Will RBS face further criminal charges in the US over this scandal? Hester gives a slightly opaque answer - saying that he cannot think of further criminal activity off the top of his head. However, various other legal cases have already been disclosed -- including a \"money laundering case sitting in the queue'. Is there a risk of a cartel between investment banks to deliberately fix the Libor rate? Hester reckons that the problem is at a more junior level: There was a mateyness, a city bars kind of thing, going back to the Big Bang. But senior people have not been gathering in rooms like a formal cartel, he insists. Next question for CEO and chairman -- why did you not have adequate controls in place to keep traders in line? Hampton confirms that the UK Financial Services Authority is quite right to say that the bank did not have any LIBOR-related systems and controls in place until March 2011. He says: We had no controls, absolutely. Libor has been going since the mid 1980, and we had no controls in place [on Libor submissions]. Generally speaking, banks didn't have controls in place. This is a pretty serious issue -- as RBS actually told the FSA in March 2011 that its LIBOR related systems and controls were adequate, but it now concedes this was not correct. Hester adds that tighter controls have been brought in since, with changes at senior level. What's the situation in America now? Hester says that the US regulators have not found any evidence that rate fixing extended to the US dollar, but involved the Swiss franc and the yen. Presumably the penalties would have been even bigger if dollar Libor fixing had also taken place. Hester doesn't think the fine will affect other operations in the US, but points out that probes of this type can affect all parts of a global bank: There is no operation of RBS that does not require the company to be in satisfactory position with its regulators. Many thousands of RBS staff will lose their bonuses for the last year, because of the Libor fine. This is pretty tough for them, he says. The ironic thing about the refusal to name the 21 guilty people is that the only name we do have -- John Hourican -- was not actually responsible. But is taking responsibility. Hampton is using nautical analogies, referring to: The captain on the bridge thing, when the iceberg was hit, or the ship hit the land. Thus Hourican walks the plank. How much will the RBS bonus pool be this year? Hester won't comment - says it will come out in the bank's financial results in two weeks. Who are the two managers who left the group? And what was their role? Hester says that there were three supervisors who were 'over' the wrongdoers (ie, in the reporting chain). Our judgement was that they were sufficiently close in reporting terms that while not ..guilty, they carried enough responsibility, he says. Hester is also refusing to name any of the 21 people whose wrongdoing led to the fine. Was RBS cross that the Treasury declared in recent days that RBS staff should pay the cost of the fine? (this is the \u00a3300m that will come from the bank's bonus pot). Philip Hampton says it's 'absolutely reasonable' for staff to carry the can. Given the force of the extra cost - it came from the employees, not from anything the shareholders had done. Stephen Hester is not keen to give a yes or no answer to the question of whether he considered resigning. There are ups and downs in this job, he says, pledging: I'll try not to fail Next question -- is RBS co-operating with the authorities over potential criminal action against those involved? And what did you have to do to get fired for Libor fiddling, rather than simply disciplined? Hampton confirms that RBS is working with all the relevant bodies over potential charges. He also says that those who lost their jobs were dismissed \"pretty summarily\". Hester chips in, adding that there were probably \"three or four\" ringleaders involved in the Libor fiddling. Some final written warnings have also been issued - including one to a young graduate who had only just joined the Bank and got caught up in an email exchange, Hester adds. Hampton, is also arguing that the culpability for Libor should not fall on Hester or the RBS board. It's tough on John Hourican, he adds. RBS chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, argues that RBS wasn't the only organisation which failed to spot the Libor problem Certainly our regulator weren't giving it enough priority. Not was the press, he argues. Well, we're making up for it now The second questioner seeks a simple yes/no question as to whether Hester considered resigning, and reminds him of the other scandals in British banking (PPI, interest rate swaps): It is right for me to want to finish the job - it is up to others to decide whether I and the board are capable of that. In other words - the UK Treasury can decide whether it wants Hester to carry on. On the second point, Hester says that those other issues are 'industry wide'. And, somewhat worryingly, he predicts that there are further problems in the banking sector, and within RBS, that have yet to come out. First question goes to our own Jill Treanor -- has Stephen Hester considered resigning? Hester replies that \"it is important that everyone is responsible for what goes on on our watch, the good things and the bad things\". However, there is no evidence that the scandal went as far as the board room. Hester says he was put into RBS (after it almost collapsed) to clean up a huge mess: I believe RBS has made incredible progress from the dark days of threatening this country in financial and other terms. Hester adds that he can be dismissed at any time if those in charge feel he is failing, but insists he is committed to finishing the job. RBS also insisting that there is not evidence that traders deliberately tried to mislead the markets about the banks cost of borrowing -- this was done for personal gain. Hampton is also taking the 'few rotten apples' line: A small number of people have exposed the bank to \"serious reputational damage\", and lost touch with what was right, he adds. The RBS press conference is underway! Philip Hampton says the board became aware of some potential issues relating to Libor around two years ago, confirming that 21 individuals were involved (see earlier post). Also confirming that John Hourican is leaving. The FSA's full ruling against RBS is online here (pdf). It too has plenty of damning exchanges between traders. For example: Broker B: u see 3m jpy libor going anywhere btween [sic] now and IMM?4 Primary Submitter B: looks fairly static to be honest, poss more pressure on upside, but not a lot Broker B: Oh. we hve a mutual friend who'd love to see it go down, no chance at all? Primary Submitter B: haha [External Trader A] by chance Broker B: shhh Primary Submitter B: hehehe, mine should remain flat, always suits me if anything to go lower as I rcve funds Broker B: gotcha, thanks, and, if u cud see ur [sic] way to a small drop there might be a steak in it for ya, haha Primary Submitter B: noted ;-) For the love of a steak, a lot of money was lost.... Sky News say they've got hold of a memo sent to RBS staff from the departing Head of Markets and International Division, John Hourican: In related news.. If you're reading on a mobile, you might not be able to watch that Stephen Hester video -- but clicking here should work. A selection of reaction from the UK media: A reminder: RBS will hold a press conference to discuss today's Libor fine at 2.30pm, so in around 15 minutes. RBS has issued a video clip of its chief executive, Stephen Hester, talking about today's fines. In it he says: I think that I have to say that this whole episode on the one hand disgusts me and on the other hand deeply depresses me. RBS employees will pay a total of \u00a3300m towards the \u00a3390m worth of fines imposed on the banks. This will come from its bonus pot ('incentive pay' in the jargon), with the Markets division hit hardest. That will roughly cover the total amount that will flow across the Atlantic to the US regulators, the DoJ and the CFTC. The remaining \u00a387.5m levied by the FSA will remain in the UK. Speaking on Sky News, Tracey McDermott, the head of enforcement at the FSA, said: A number of individuals in banks seem to have decided that the rules didn't apply to them. Today's settlement shows that RBS struggled to get to grips with Libor rigging. Our City editor Jill Treanor has been scouring the details, and reports: RBS has also revealed that action has been taken, or is still being undertaken, against the 21 staff members implicated in fixing Libor Here's the breakdown: \u2022 Six staff have been dismissed for LIBOR related misconduct, including two managers. \u2022 Six have been severely disciplined or are going through a disciplinary process. \u2022 Eight left the organisation before disciplinary action could be taken. \u2022 One was dismissed for misconduct not related to these findings. RBS added that \"two managers with supervisory responsibilities have also left the Group\" As rumoured, the head of RBS's investment bank is leaving. John Hourican will receive 12 month's pay, but will surrender all the unvested bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan awards that can be clawed back (thought to be worth around \u00a34m). RBS said: While John had no involvement in or knowledge of the misconduct, and very notable business achievements while in office, both John and the Board felt it was right that he leave the organisation in recognition of the management issues identified in relation to this settlement and the impact on the Group\u2019s reputation. Here's another exchange between an RBS trader and a colleague who submitted the bank's Libor rate: May 14, 2009: Swiss Franc Trader: [Primary Submitter] pls can we get super high 3m[,] super low 6m Swiss Franc Trader: PRETTY PLEASE! Primary Submitter: 41 &amp; 51 Swiss Franc Trader: if u did that[,] i would lvoe [sic] u forever Primary Submitter: 41 &amp; 55 then \u2026 Swiss Franc Trader: if u did that i would come over there and make love to you[,] your choice Primary Submitter: 41+51 it is Swiss Franc Trader: thouht [sic] so Primary Submitter: so shallow Royal Bank of Scotland has issued a formal response to today's Libor fine. I've pasted it in full: Philip Hampton, RBS Chairman, said: \"The RBS Board acknowledges that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls and also in the integrity of a small group of our employees. This is a sad day for RBS, but also an important one in continuing to put right the mistakes of the past. \u201cWe have to fix the culture in the banking industry. The most important part of that is focusing our efforts on the needs of our customers and acting with integrity. And it also involves facing up to the Bank\u2019s past failings, no matter how uncomfortable that is. That is why those responsible have left the organisation or been subject to disciplinary action. The Board has also used all means possible to ensure the gravity of this issue is reflected in the remuneration received by employees. No one should be left in any doubt about how seriously RBS takes these failings. \u201cAlthough this wrongdoing went undetected for longer than we would have wished, in this and across all risk areas we are working hard to root out bad practices and put them right for the future. This process has no short cuts but does have our full attention.\" Stephen Hester, RBS Group Chief Executive, said: \u201cI want to speak very clearly and on behalf of the 137,000 employees of RBS. We condemn the behaviour of the individuals who sought to influence some LIBOR currency settings at our bank from 2006-10. There is no place at RBS for such behaviour. \u201cWe are also determined to correct the broad range of control and risk management failures that originated in RBS during the financial boom years. LIBOR manipulation is one example. This is a painstaking task undertaken carefully and diligently over five years. We know that we cannot detect and solve every problem as fast as we would like. But our commitment is absolute. We are dedicated to creating a safe and secure RBS that serves customers well and that, in the right way, creates value for those who rely on us. \u201cLIBOR manipulation is an extreme example of a selfish and self-serving culture that took hold in parts of the banking industry during the financial boom. We will use the lessons learned from this episode as further motivation to reject and change the vestiges of that culture. RBS is making substantial progress overall. Today's announcement is not the first and will not be the last reminder of the scale of the changes that need to be made. But our determination to clean up RBS for all is undiminished. The documents released by the CFTC and the FSA are riddled with examples of RBS traders conspiring to fix Libor. Libor is meant to be an honest, reliable measure of the cost of borrowing between banks. It is calculated by the daily submissions made by a group of banks. But - as at Barclays and UBS - it's clear that some traders conspired to fix the rate by changing the rate that they submitted to the Libor panel. Here are some of the most remarkable exchanges identified: September 15: Yen Trader 1: can we lower our fixings today please [Primary Submitter] Primary Submitter: make your mind up[,] haha , yes no probs Yen Trader 1: im like a whores drawers ..... September 19, 2008: (RBS Order p. 23.) Interdealer Broker B: can you do me a favour \u2026 you\u2019re not going to get paid any bro for this and we\u2019ll send you lunch around for the whole desk. Can you flat\u2026can you switch two years semi at 5 3/4 , 100 yards [meaning 100 billion] \u2026 between UBS. Just get \u2026 take it from UBS, give it back to UBS. He wants to pay some bro. We won\u2019t bro you\u2026 Yen Trader 1: Yeah, yeah [\u2026] Interdealer Broker B: Yeah. Yeah. 100 yards \u2026 actually can you make it 150 and I\u2019ll send lunch around for everybody? Yen Trader 1: Yeah. Interdealer Broker B: Thanks very much. Cheers. Cheers, mate and you choose lunch. ... December 4, 2008: Swiss Franc Trader: can u put 6m swiss libor in low pls? Primary Submitter: NO Swiss Franc Trader: should have pushed the door harder Primary Submitter: Whats it worth Swiss Franc Trader: ive got some sushi rolls from yesterday? [\u2026] Primary Submitter: ok low 6m , just for u Swiss Franc Trader: wooooooohooooooo[,] 0.01%? thatd be awesome Primary Submitter: 1.33 Swiss Franc Trader: perfect[.] u r a nice man .... The Financial Services Authority's announcement has also been published,. It says the practice of Libor rate-rigging was \"widespread\", with \"at least 219 requests for inappropriate submissions were documented \u2013 an unquantifiable number of oral requests, which by their nature would not be documented, were also made. The FSA also says that at least 21 people were involved, including \"derivatives and money market traders\" and at least one manager. The total fine for Libor rigging comes to around \u00a3390m. Here's the breakdown: \u2022 CFTC: $325m (\u00a3207m) \u2022 Financial Services Authority: \u00a387.5m \u2022 US Department of Justice $150m (\u00a395m) The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission is highly critical of RBS in its announcement of the $325m fine which the bank must pay. David Meister, the CFTC\u2019s Director of Enforcement, said: The integrity of LIBOR depends on truthful information provided by a select group of some of the world\u2019s most important banks. The public is deprived of an honest benchmark interest rate when a group of traders sits around a desk for years falsely spinning their bank\u2019s LIBOR submissions, trying to manufacture winning trades. That\u2019s what happened at RBS. The full statement is online here The charges brought against RBS relate to: Successful manipulation, attempted manipulation, and false reporting relating to LIBOR for Yen and Swiss Franc. They cover the period between mid-2006 and 2010. That means the practice continued after it was partially nationalised. Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined for its role in the Libor rate-fixing scandal. RBS and regulators on both side of the Atlantic are announcing that the bank, majority owned by the UK taxpayer, will pay the penalty after its traders manipulated the London inter-bank operating rate (Libor). The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is fining RBS $325m, or around \u00a3207m. More fines are due in the next few minutes, from the UK's Financial Services Authority and the US Department of Justice. RBS is now the third bank to reach a settlement over Libor, after Barclays and UBS. We'll be covering the story for the next few hours, with full details of the fine and the deal RBS has struck with US authorities. RBS is due to give a press conference at 2.30pm, and reaction is already flooding in. Here's some background to the case \u2022 RBS bankers must pay Libor fine, says George Osborne - 4 February 2013 \u2022 Libor rigging: US regulators may want RBS to plead guilty to criminal charges - 29 January 2013 \u2022 Barclays fined \u00a3290m as bid to manipulate interest rates is exposed - 27 June 2012 \u2022 What is the London interbank offered rate? - 17 August 2009",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, will be answering your questions live from 12.30pm GMT", 
      "body": "<p>The chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland will be appearing live on theguardian.com to answer readers' questions about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/06/rbs-fined-libor-rigging-scandal\">the \u00a3390m fine the bank is paying to settle allegations it rigged Libor</a>. The webchat will take place from <strong>12.30pm GMT on 7 February.</strong></p> <p>Sir Philip Hampton is chairman of the bank which was bailed out in October 2008, eventually with a total of \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds.</p> <p>He will answer questions about the \u00a3390m fine that regulators in the UK and the US have levelled on the bank for the rigging of the key benchmark rate which is used to set the rate of borrowing on \u00a3300tn of financial products around the world.</p> <p>Hampton, who was appointed chairman after the taxpayer bailout, has said that 21 of the bank's 137,000 staff were involved in the manipulation of Libor. In his formal response to the fine, he wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have to fix the culture in the banking industry. The most important part of that is focusing our efforts on the needs of our customers and acting with integrity. And it also involves facing up to the Bank's past failings, no matter how uncomfortable that is. That is why those responsible have left the organisation or been subject to disciplinary action. The Board has also used all means possible to ensure the gravity of this issue is reflected in the remuneration received by employees. No one should be left in any doubt about how seriously RBS takes these failings.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/06/libor-scandal-rbs-your-questions?commentpage=2\">Please post your questions for the RBS chairman in the comments section below</a></strong></p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton is live online and answering questions now</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hello,</p> <p>I'm online and will be answering questions now. I'm sure you will not hold back!</p> </blockquote> <h2>OmarSelim asks:</h2> <p>1- do you dispute that rigging interest rate is a major crime that warrants criminal prosecution?<br>2- Do you accept that the buck stops with you in the LIBOR crime?<br>3- Do you believe you deserve the remuneration you are getting?</p> <h2>Sir Philip responds:</h2> <p>1. If people break the law they should face the full weight of the criminal justice system. We have already seen traders at other banks arrested over LIBOR manipulation and I expect we will see more. That is how it should be. If people don't end up in prison over this scandal I worry it will further perpetuate the sense that there is one rule for the financial system and another set of rules for the rest of society. That's dangerous and it's wrong. In the case of former RBS traders the authorities now have plenty of evidence to look at and I expect they will be doing just that. If we can help them, we will.</p> <p>2. I am the Chairman and the buck stops with me. That's one reason I'm here answering questions today. There is no doubt that mistakes have occurred on my watch and of course I regret that. In addition to the major physical restructuring of the bank - perhaps the biggest turnaround of its kind in the world - Stephen Hester and I certainly knew that cleaning up the culture of RBS needed to be a priority. Yesterday's settlement was painful evidence that the culture of a 150,000 person organisation cannot be turned around overnight. My view is that it's easy to come up with flashy statements on culture and whipping bankers into shape, but much harder to make the thousands of little changes that will be required to make a real difference.</p> <p>3. my remuneration is set by other people according to market norms. It is high, but I don't think the pay for the RBS chairman has moved since 2006.</p> <h2>jamesgor asks:</h2> <p>Do you see any connection at all between the cultural imperatives which lead to the libor fixing and your current total lack of focus on customer care in your high street banks?</p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton responds:</h2> <p>@jamesgor - We are hugely focused on customers in the high street and throughout our business. It's also true that customers have not been given sufficient attention by the banking industry, for many years. It's a key thing that needs to be fixed. It is linked absolutely to the Libor issues which again show scant regard to the interests of customers.</p> <h2>Whitehatter asks:</h2> <p>Will you ensure that taxpayers are protected from paying the fines levied due to the actions of RBS employees, and recover this money from bankers' bonus payments and salaries?</p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton responds:</h2> <p>@Whitehatter - Taxpayers own the great majority of the shares in RBS which is another reason why we very much want to protect their interests. These fines are a big cost and we need to try to recover those costs. As very obvious place is from the more highly paid employees that we have. We plan to recover all of the money that will be paid to settle the US fines from pay.</p> <h2>rosodave asks:</h2> <p>Do you believe that at least some, if not all of the 21 people involved in the libor rigging should face criminal charges? You seem to be suggesting that having lost their jobs with your bank is sufficient punishment for their actions</p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton responds:</h2> <p>As I've said earlier, anybody committing crimes should face the full face of the law. In business terms, certainly, these are serious crimes by any measure</p> <h2>rosodave also asks:</h2> <p>Are you comfortable with the fact that just one year's bonus paid to some bankers is more money than a nurse, teacher and even some doctors will make in a lifetime of dedicated hard work?</p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton responds:</h2> <p>I've said many times that I think pay in banks is too high, especially investment banks. The bonuses are falling sharply now, especially at RBS. As a general rule however I think bonuses that are justified by strong financial results are much more understandable, where the banking industry has failed in recent years is that high pay is associated with poor financial performance</p> <h2>defragmentation asks:</h2> <p>Many of the problems (cultural as well as financial) experienced by banks have been caused by the move away from 'customer service' and towards 'shareholder value'--discuss</p> <p>Senior staff in banks should not hold shares (in any form) as this creates a conflict of interest when making business decisions-discuss</p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton responds:</h2> <p>@defragmentation - You have to do both. You only get shareholder value in most businesses - especially banks - by making sure that your customer service and your products are up to scratch. It's not an either/or. But you are right that in recent years shareholder value - particularly short-term shareholder value - came to dominate banking strategy. I think this process is now being reversed.</p> <h2>Bermondsey asks:</h2> <p>Could you explain to the British public why 14 year old children are thrown into prison for 3 years for writing nonsense on Facebook and why someone looses their home and goes to jail for doing a nanny job while receiving \u00a370 week in social security while Fred Goodman lives in his holiday home in Barbados for 3 months a year? Why have you not been sacked and arrested?</p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton responds:</h2> <p>@Bermondsey - I've said before here that serious action should be taken against people who've committed serious crimes. RBS is not the law enforcer, but where we have sanctions in terms of firing people or removing financial incentives we have applied them in a very tough way.</p> <p>I completely understand that the financial (and other) harm that was done in the financial crisis is very painful for many people in the country.</p> <h2>TheJoyOfEssex asks:</h2> <p>Firstly, congratulations on having the cajones to face an obviously hostile crowd.</p> <p>My question - In the current economic climate how many staff do you think RBS would lose if you paid zero bonuses this year?</p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton responds:</h2> <p>I absolutely understand the concern about high banker pay and I share it. But we also need to operate in a competitive commercial environment and we won't turn this bank around without having top quality people to do it. I think the risk to the bank of paying zero bonuses would be too great a risk to accept.</p> <h2>MFV1037 asks:</h2> <p>\"We have to fix the culture in the banking industry.\"</p> <p>Since becoming Chairman in February 2009 what have you done to fix the culture at RBS?</p> <p>With the unprecedented fine that RBS have just been given, do you agree that you failed?</p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton responds:</h2> <p>@MFV1037 -</p> <p>Culture change doesn't happen overnight. It takes a lot of work and it requires in many cases quite a lot of new people, but I'm satisfied that RBS is changing quite fundamentally.</p> <p>Central to this is putting customers front and centre of all our employees' minds, whether they be branch staff or currency traders. A bank that puts customers first wouldn't sell a PPI policy to a person who could never claim on it. It wouldn't allow people to take on a mortgage they couldn't afford. And a banker that puts customers first wouldn't cheat the interest rate system for their own benefit. This may sound like 'motherhood and apple pie', but it's fundamental. To achieve it we have to think about training; about incentives; about the products we should be offering and the products we need to stop offering; about the way we recruit people and the sort of values we want to promote. The list goes on.</p> <h2>lorduxbridge asks:</h2> <p>Just a little one from me.</p> <p>I was always given to understand traders were extremely well-qualified and intelligent individuals.</p> <p>Please review the standard of English exhibited here.</p> <p>I'd like to know how these chaps passed GCSE English, let alone 'made it' into a position of responsibility at a City firm.</p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton responds:</h2> <p>@lorduxbridge - I hope your leg is better. Didn't you lose it in 1815?</p> <p>The language in some of the emails and messages that have been published is wretched, even allowing for the fact that these are effectively market traders and we all know that bad language happens in vigorous markets. But it's what it says about the culture rather than the grammar which is most disturbing.</p> <h2>benj67 asks:</h2> <p>How do you continue to justify continued your role in financing the Canadian tar sands, arguably a greater crime than the Libor scandal?</p> <h2>Sir Philip Hampton responds:</h2> <p>@benj67 - We haven't lent money to tar sands projects for at least four years. By the same token we stopped all association with businesses that make cluster bombs. We take these environmental and sustainability concerns extremely seriously.

      "bodyText": "The chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland will be appearing live on theguardian.com to answer readers' questions about the \u00a3390m fine the bank is paying to settle allegations it rigged Libor. The webchat will take place from 12.30pm GMT on 7 February. Sir Philip Hampton is chairman of the bank which was bailed out in October 2008, eventually with a total of \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds. He will answer questions about the \u00a3390m fine that regulators in the UK and the US have levelled on the bank for the rigging of the key benchmark rate which is used to set the rate of borrowing on \u00a3300tn of financial products around the world. Hampton, who was appointed chairman after the taxpayer bailout, has said that 21 of the bank's 137,000 staff were involved in the manipulation of Libor. In his formal response to the fine, he wrote: We have to fix the culture in the banking industry. The most important part of that is focusing our efforts on the needs of our customers and acting with integrity. And it also involves facing up to the Bank's past failings, no matter how uncomfortable that is. That is why those responsible have left the organisation or been subject to disciplinary action. The Board has also used all means possible to ensure the gravity of this issue is reflected in the remuneration received by employees. No one should be left in any doubt about how seriously RBS takes these failings. Please post your questions for the RBS chairman in the comments section below Sir Philip Hampton is live online and answering questions now Hello, I'm online and will be answering questions now. I'm sure you will not hold back! OmarSelim asks: 1- do you dispute that rigging interest rate is a major crime that warrants criminal prosecution? 2- Do you accept that the buck stops with you in the LIBOR crime? 3- Do you believe you deserve the remuneration you are getting? Sir Philip responds: 1. If people break the law they should face the full weight of the criminal justice system. We have already seen traders at other banks arrested over LIBOR manipulation and I expect we will see more. That is how it should be. If people don't end up in prison over this scandal I worry it will further perpetuate the sense that there is one rule for the financial system and another set of rules for the rest of society. That's dangerous and it's wrong. In the case of former RBS traders the authorities now have plenty of evidence to look at and I expect they will be doing just that. If we can help them, we will. 2. I am the Chairman and the buck stops with me. That's one reason I'm here answering questions today. There is no doubt that mistakes have occurred on my watch and of course I regret that. In addition to the major physical restructuring of the bank - perhaps the biggest turnaround of its kind in the world - Stephen Hester and I certainly knew that cleaning up the culture of RBS needed to be a priority. Yesterday's settlement was painful evidence that the culture of a 150,000 person organisation cannot be turned around overnight. My view is that it's easy to come up with flashy statements on culture and whipping bankers into shape, but much harder to make the thousands of little changes that will be required to make a real difference. 3. my remuneration is set by other people according to market norms. It is high, but I don't think the pay for the RBS chairman has moved since 2006. jamesgor asks: Do you see any connection at all between the cultural imperatives which lead to the libor fixing and your current total lack of focus on customer care in your high street banks? Sir Philip Hampton responds: @jamesgor - We are hugely focused on customers in the high street and throughout our business. It's also true that customers have not been given sufficient attention by the banking industry, for many years. It's a key thing that needs to be fixed. It is linked absolutely to the Libor issues which again show scant regard to the interests of customers. Whitehatter asks: Will you ensure that taxpayers are protected from paying the fines levied due to the actions of RBS employees, and recover this money from bankers' bonus payments and salaries? Sir Philip Hampton responds: @Whitehatter - Taxpayers own the great majority of the shares in RBS which is another reason why we very much want to protect their interests. These fines are a big cost and we need to try to recover those costs. As very obvious place is from the more highly paid employees that we have. We plan to recover all of the money that will be paid to settle the US fines from pay. rosodave asks: Do you believe that at least some, if not all of the 21 people involved in the libor rigging should face criminal charges? You seem to be suggesting that having lost their jobs with your bank is sufficient punishment for their actions Sir Philip Hampton responds: As I've said earlier, anybody committing crimes should face the full face of the law. In business terms, certainly, these are serious crimes by any measure rosodave also asks: Are you comfortable with the fact that just one year's bonus paid to some bankers is more money than a nurse, teacher and even some doctors will make in a lifetime of dedicated hard work? Sir Philip Hampton responds: I've said many times that I think pay in banks is too high, especially investment banks. The bonuses are falling sharply now, especially at RBS. As a general rule however I think bonuses that are justified by strong financial results are much more understandable, where the banking industry has failed in recent years is that high pay is associated with poor financial performance defragmentation asks: Many of the problems (cultural as well as financial) experienced by banks have been caused by the move away from 'customer service' and towards 'shareholder value'--discuss Senior staff in banks should not hold shares (in any form) as this creates a conflict of interest when making business decisions-discuss Sir Philip Hampton responds: @defragmentation - You have to do both. You only get shareholder value in most businesses - especially banks - by making sure that your customer service and your products are up to scratch. It's not an either/or. But you are right that in recent years shareholder value - particularly short-term shareholder value - came to dominate banking strategy. I think this process is now being reversed. Bermondsey asks: Could you explain to the British public why 14 year old children are thrown into prison for 3 years for writing nonsense on Facebook and why someone looses their home and goes to jail for doing a nanny job while receiving \u00a370 week in social security while Fred Goodman lives in his holiday home in Barbados for 3 months a year? Why have you not been sacked and arrested? Sir Philip Hampton responds: @Bermondsey - I've said before here that serious action should be taken against people who've committed serious crimes. RBS is not the law enforcer, but where we have sanctions in terms of firing people or removing financial incentives we have applied them in a very tough way. I completely understand that the financial (and other) harm that was done in the financial crisis is very painful for many people in the country. TheJoyOfEssex asks: Firstly, congratulations on having the cajones to face an obviously hostile crowd. My question - In the current economic climate how many staff do you think RBS would lose if you paid zero bonuses this year? Sir Philip Hampton responds: I absolutely understand the concern about high banker pay and I share it. But we also need to operate in a competitive commercial environment and we won't turn this bank around without having top quality people to do it. I think the risk to the bank of paying zero bonuses would be too great a risk to accept. MFV1037 asks: \"We have to fix the culture in the banking industry.\" Since becoming Chairman in February 2009 what have you done to fix the culture at RBS? With the unprecedented fine that RBS have just been given, do you agree that you failed? Sir Philip Hampton responds: @MFV1037 - Culture change doesn't happen overnight. It takes a lot of work and it requires in many cases quite a lot of new people, but I'm satisfied that RBS is changing quite fundamentally. Central to this is putting customers front and centre of all our employees' minds, whether they be branch staff or currency traders. A bank that puts customers first wouldn't sell a PPI policy to a person who could never claim on it. It wouldn't allow people to take on a mortgage they couldn't afford. And a banker that puts customers first wouldn't cheat the interest rate system for their own benefit. This may sound like 'motherhood and apple pie', but it's fundamental. To achieve it we have to think about training; about incentives; about the products we should be offering and the products we need to stop offering; about the way we recruit people and the sort of values we want to promote. The list goes on. lorduxbridge asks: Just a little one from me. I was always given to understand traders were extremely well-qualified and intelligent individuals. Please review the standard of English exhibited here. I'd like to know how these chaps passed GCSE English, let alone 'made it' into a position of responsibility at a City firm. Sir Philip Hampton responds: @lorduxbridge - I hope your leg is better. Didn't you lose it in 1815? The language in some of the emails and messages that have been published is wretched, even allowing for the fact that these are effectively market traders and we all know that bad language happens in vigorous markets. But it's what it says about the culture rather than the grammar which is most disturbing. benj67 asks: How do you continue to justify continued your role in financing the Canadian tar sands, arguably a greater crime than the Libor scandal? Sir Philip Hampton responds: @benj67 - We haven't lent money to tar sands projects for at least four years. By the same token we stopped all association with businesses that make cluster bombs. We take these environmental and sustainability concerns extremely seriously. We do of course have extensive business dealings with major oil companies such as BP and Shell, and have done for many decades. davefourdogs asks: Dear Sir Phillip. Do you care what the average Guardian reader thinks? Sir Philip Hampton responds: @davefourdogs - I think of little else. I am a guardian reader, particularly the business and sports pages. downhollander asks: Were the banks largely responsible for our current economic woes as the Chancellor said this week or was the previous government as he says ever other week? Sir Philip Hampton responds: @downhollander - The financial crisis centred on the banks has had a massive impact on the performance of the economy, on jobs and living standards. It's why we need to make sure that we don't have a repeat of a financial crisis by making sure that the banks are soundly financed and properly managed. Sir Philip Hampton has now left the webchat: That was a brilliant set of questions - sorry I wasn't able to answer all of them. But maybe next time.

      "bodyText": "That's a good moment to finish, I think. Thanks for reading and commenting - sorry the service was a bit spartan this afternoon. Blame those RBS libor fixers. Anyway Thursday will be a more exciting day, with the European Central Bank holding its monthly press conference. What, I wonder, will Mario Draghi say about the corruption scandal in Spain and the increasingly tight Italian election? We'll find out tomorrow! Until then, goodnight! Important developments in Ireland tonight - it appears that the Dublin government is poised to liquidate Anglo Irish Bank. The dramatic move would allow Ireland to resolve the long-standing problem of the Promissory Notes issued to help pay for the nationalisation of Anglo, and which threatened to drain Ireland of much-needed capital for many years to come. Michael Noonan, Ireland's minister for finance, is expected to give a speech on the issue tonight. RTE is running a live blog on the situation -- so I suggest you point your browser over there! Promissory Note Updates Over to Greece again -- where we learn the governing coalition partners are now holding talks to discuss how best to handle a range of pressing issues including the resurgence in industrial action Our correspondent Helena Smith reports that leaders have also been meeting Germany\u2019s main opposition leader today. She writes: Prime Minister Antonis Samaras began the talks with his junior partners against a backdrop of protests and mounting discontent. The government\u2019s recourse to mobilization of striking seamen today, and metro workers a few weeks ago, has deeply troubled both of his power-sharing partners especially Fotis Kouvellis, head of the small Democratic Left party. Aides say the meeting will also focus on protesting farmers. The socialist Pasok leader, Evangelos Venizelos, is particularly concerned by the looming showdown between farmers who are enraged by higher taxes and production costs and have threatened blockades of central arteries up and down the country, and a government that under pressure from international lenders has almost no room for manoeuvre. Meanwhile, says Helena, the German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s challenger in the country\u2019s autumn general election has also been visiting Athens \u2013 and, it would seem, saying all the right things. She writes: He may be gaffe prone back home but in Greece Peer Steinbruck, the Social Democrat candidate for the German chancellorship, has been busy making statements that are music to the ears of those who met him today. The politician said it was clear that the debt-choked country \u201cneeds time to succeed in its stabilisation and for people to regain confidence.\u201d After holding talks with his fellow Social Democrat Evangelos Venizelos, the German leader insisted that confidence in Greece was vital if it was to lure foreign investment again. \u201cConfidence is absolutely necessary for investments not just from Greeks but foreigners because very simply ... austerity alone cannot bring results,\u201d he said noting that Greek workers and pensioners had already suffered cuts in the range of 30 and 40 percent. The social democrat who was also given an overview of the Greek economy by finance minister Yiannis Stournaras added that \u201cmeasures that would not be imposed on our own people should not be imposed on another country.\u201d Hello again. Some rather alarming news from Italy -- Silvio Berlusconi narrowed the lead of front-runner Pier Luigi Bersani to within the margin of error of an opinion poll for the first time. With the elections taking place on February 24th and 25th, the coalition of Berlusconi's People of Liberty Party and the Northern League is now attracting 29.4% of the vote, up 0.1%. Bersani's left-leaning coalition is polling at 33.1%, down 0.2 percentage points. The polling data has a margin of error of 4%, so Berlusconi could actually be ahead -- having pledged to abolish Italy's unpopular property tax. The election is likely to be decided in a couple of regions, including Lombardy in the north. It's looking increasingly close.... More here Germany has hit back at the suggestion from the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, that the euro was overvalued - and that new exchange rate controls are needed. German chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, argued that the euro was not overvalued, if you took a long view. Via Reuters, here are the quotes from Seibert: If you look at the historic context, the German government is of the view that the euro is not overvalued at the moment. and: There will certainly be a conversation about that ... but the view of the German government is that exchange rate policy is not a suitable instrument to increase competitiveness...You only achieve short-term impulses through targeted devaluation. A long-term strengthening of competitiveness is not achieved in that way and Our basic conviction is that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamental data. PS: updates may be light this afternoon due to other events.... Poland's central bank has cut its headline interest rate by a quarter-point, to 3.75%, in the latest example of monetary policy easing. Here are some more photos from the protests at Athens' Piraeus port today: (see 11.20am): Meanwhile, Helena reports that Greek media are running shocking footage showing desperate Greeks fighting with one another earlier today outside the agriculture ministry in central Athens, where farmers, protesting agianst production costs, were handing out free fruit and vegetables. Here are two clips from the scene: In commentary run alongside the video, the Greek news portal Newsit described the scenes that followed the farmers' decision to set up a makeshift market as \"chaotic.\" Newsit added: These people are not beggars, they are the victims of an economic crisis that like a hurricane has swept over and levelled entire families. They are people next door who until yesterday had jobs and lead a normal life. Today, these people, swallowing their pride and dignity, are going wherever they can to find a little free food, standing in line as they did today in Vathis square. A huge rally is underway in the port of Piraeus, in Greece, as protesters gather in solidarity for striking seamen who were forced to return to work this morning or be sacked. Other workers are now striking in sympathy. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Thousands of communist militants, unionists and other supporters have converged on Pireaus to denounce the government\u2019s decision to mobilise seamen this morning. The KKE communist party leader Aleka Papariga also joined the rally as political forces opposed to the strident terms of the bailouts debt-received Greece has received from the EU and IMF hit back in solidarity for the seaman. Crews and dock workers returned to work under threat of being fired -- with the first ferries setting sail and riot police leaving the port -- but other sectors have now walked off the job in a massive display of support for the strikers. At noon local time employees operating bus lines, trolleys and the suburban railway network began a four-hour work stoppage as the civil servants union, ADEDY, and the country\u2019s biggest private sector force, the General Confederation of Greek Labour (GSEE), retaliated with a 24-hour strike. Both unions have released withering statements decrying the conservative-dominated coalition\u2019s \u201cundemocratic\u201d decision to break up the seamens' strike. The ADEDY union said: ADEDY wholeheartedly denounces the government decision to move ahead with the policy of mobilizing striking seamen. It is the second time in less than two weeks that it has resorted to this anti-democratic practice of penalizing workers and strike action, confirming with its action that democracy, and the fundamental rights of workers, have effectively been suspended. The government, ADEDY continued, should know that the \u201csystematic undermining\u201d of the hard-earned rights of unions and workers \u201cviolate the country\u2019s constitution and international and European treaties protecting the rights of workers.\u201d The use of martial law \u201cin a democratic European\u201d was outrageous. The president of the Panhellenic Union of Seamen, Antonis Dalacogiorgos, said protesters would march on the merchant marine ministry within the day while the union\u2019s central committee would also meet to decide on what course of action to take. Another line from the IFS Green Budget - it predicts that a euro breakup would send UK into a deep recession, pushing national debt above 100% of GDP. Here's the graph (via Sky's Ed Conway, whose also at the IFS briefing) Bad news for chancellor George Osborne, and the rest of the UK, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. In its latest Green Budget, the IFS warned that Britain will have borrowed \u00a364bn more than expected by the time of the next general election in 2015. It also predicted that 1.2m public sector jobs will have been cut by 2018 - 300,00 more than previously estimated. The Guardian's economics editor, Larry Elliott, is at the event, and radios in that: The UK's leading tax and spending experts said that the public finances would be in a worse state in 2015 than permitted under the plans made by the last Labour government to tackle the deficit. In its annual health check on the public finances, the IFS said the chancellor was allowing extra borrowing to take the strain during the current parliament at the expense of another bout of austerity after the 2015 election. On the eurozone, the report (produced with Oxford Economics) predicted a 0.2% contraction this year - with the risks 'balanced' (so a less worrying situation than last year). Japan's Nikkei index closed at its highest level for four and a half years this morning. It jumped by 3.8% in its biggest one-day rally in almost two years, finishing 416.83 points higher to 11,463.75. The trigger was the news yesterday that Bank of Japan governor Masaaki Shirakawa is stepping aside three weeks early - meaning the process of priming the printing presses, driving inflation towards 2% and going for growth can begin a bit earlier. Europe's economic woes have hurt the world's largest steelmaker, ArcelorMittal. ArcelorMittal posted a net loss of $3.99bn (\u20ac2.94 billion) for the 2012, with sales down 14%. The heavy loss was mainly due to a $4.8bn of charges and write-downs related to its European operations, where it has closed one factory in Belgium and mothballed another two, in Spain and France. Chief executive Lakshmi Mittal pointed the blame firmly at Europe: 2012 was a very difficult year for the steel industry, particularly in Europe where demand for steel fell a further 8.8%. He added that this year will also be tough: Although we expect the challenges to continue in 2013, largely due to the fragility of the European economy, we have recently seen some more positive indicators. The closure of ArcelorMittal's plant in Belgium will cost 1,300 jobs, and is deeply unpopular. Workers took to the streets to protest late last month: European stock markets are mostly up again in early trading, clawing back some more of Monday's losses. Eurozone fears continue to abate.... FTSE 100: up 32 points at 6314, +0.5% German DAX: up 18 points at 7683, +0.25% French CAC: up 10 points at 3705, +0.28% Spanish IBEX: up 52 points at 8144, +0.6% Italian FTSE MIB: down 13 points at 16698, - 0.07% Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says trader are: prepared to overlook eurozone woes, giving greater weight to the improved [economic] macro outlook. Speaking of Greece... there is deep concern that the country's neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party has begun a support drive in Germany. Golden Dawn has set up a cell in the southern German city of Nuremberg, from where it plans to target young Greeks who have moved to Germany seeking employment. As we reported last night: Greek community leaders in Germany have condemned the arrival of the party, also known as Chrysi Avgi, and called on authorities to clamp down on a group that they said had shown its readiness to use violence in Greece and could attempt to do the same in Germany. Golden Dawn, which has close to 20 seats in the Greek parliament, has described the move on its website as the \"answer of expat Greeks to the dirty hippies and the regime of democratic dictatorship in our homeland\". More here Here's the latest details of the attempt to break the Greek seaman's strike this morning, via AFP: Riot police were sent to Greece's main harbour, Piraeus, early on Wednesday to end a strike by seamen that has disrupted ferry services to the country's myriad islands for nearly a week. Television footage showed a cordon of riot police deployed at the harbour to keep a strike support force away from ships taking on passengers and cargo. Good morning, and welcome back to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis and other key events in the global economy. The Spanish cash-for-contracts row that broke last week continues to dominate our attention this morning. Luis B\u00e1rcenas, the former treasurer of the governing People's party, will face an anti-corruption prosecutor today. B\u00e1rcenas will be quizzed on those dramatic allegations that he ran a secret scheme where senior party officials received secret payments from business people, who were rewarded with government contracts. High court judge Pablo Ruz has also begun a probe, after documents dramatically published last week showed that up to \u20ac22m was concealed in a secret 'slush fund' run by B\u00e1rcenas. If true, those involved could have broken rules on money laundering and tax fraud. El Pais reports this morning that Ruz's investigation isn't limited to B\u00e1rcenas: Ruz has also issued an injunction against Jes\u00fas Sep\u00falveda, the former mayor of Pozuelo, an upscale Madrid dormitory town, to answer questions on alleged irregular payments and gifts made to him and his family by the G\u00fcrtel corruption ring in the period 2000-2005. Sep\u00falveda is the former husband of Health Minister Ana Mato, who has denied receiving luxury goods and trips as gifts from the ring. Despite the legal activity, speculation that the scandal could force Mariano Rajoy to resign as prime minister have somewhat died down. There's a growing belief that Spain's slow-moving legal system means Rajoy is safe, for a while at least\u2026 Also coming up this morning\u2026 Greek police will attempt to end a six-day strike by its seamen. As Helena Smith reported from Greece last night: The Greek government said that as of 6am Wednesday protestors will be issued with mobilisation papers that will give them little choice but to return to work or be fired. Addressing reporters, Kostas Mousouroulis, the merchant marine minister, said: \u201cThe government has made every possible effort to satisfy the demands of seamen. We exhausted dialogue and came up with specific solutions. We'll be tracking the latest developments in Spain, Greece, and beyond through the day \u2013 including the OECD's latest verdict on the UK economy (at 3pm GMT).",

      "bodyText": "Britain will have borrowed \u00a364bn more than expected by the time of the next general election after weak growth played havoc with George Osborne's deficit reduction plan, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned. The UK's leading tax and spending experts said on Wednesday the public finances would be in a worse state in 2015 than permitted under plans made by the previous Labour government to tackle the deficit. In its \"green budget\" annual healthcheck on the public finances, the IFS said the chancellor was allowing extra borrowing to take the strain during the current parliament at the expense of another bout of austerity after the 2015 election. It said on current plans those departments not protected by the government's ringfence would see their budgets fall by a third in real terms between 2010-11 and 2017-18. Public sector employment would fall by 1.2 million over the same period, it added. That is 300,000 more lost jobs than the 900,000 figure produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility last December. Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said: \"As economic performance and forecasts have worsened the chancellor has followed a dual strategy.

      "bodyText": "A flurry of complex deals struck by the Barclay brothers to gain a controlling stake in the \u00a31bn Mayfair hotel group behind Claridge's involved a \"quite astonishing, even grotesque,\" attempt to freeze out major investor Paddy McKillen, three appeal court judges were told on Tuesday. Lord Goldsmith QC, the former attorney general, accused Sir David and Sir Frederick \u2014 best known as the owners of the Ritz and Telegraph newspapers \u2014 of deploying a clever, but ultimately illegal, strategy to dominate the hotel business. The strategy, explained Goldsmith, counsel for McKillen, involved side payments to the family of fallen property tycoon Derek Quinlan, a former business partner of McKillen, who was drowning in debt. Quinlan, it was suggested, was important to the Barclays because he still owned a one-third stake in Coroin \u2014 the company behind Claridge's and sister hotels The Berkeley and The Connaught \u2014 even though the value of his shares was less than the borrowings against which they were pledged. Goldsmith is seeking to overturn a judgment handed down by Mr Justice David Richards last August which found there was nothing improper about a pact entered into by the Barclays and Quinlan. The judge ruled he saw no evidence suggesting advances of \u00a31.86m and \u20ac1m from the brothers, between late 2010 and early 2012, were part of a contract struck with the Quinlans. The Barclay twins declined to appear in court during the 30-day hearing last year, but in a witness statement \u2014 released to the Guardian only after the intervention of Justice Richards \u2014 Sir Frederick insisted financial assistance had been offered to Quinlan's family purely out of friendship. \"Helping the Quinlan family in their time of need was something that I will never regret and I would not hesitate to do it again if necessary, regardless of anything to do with Coroin [the disputed hotel group], which is irrelevant to how I feel on this issue.\" He added: \"My brother and I deeply resent the suggestion that we have been party to an unlawful conspiracy,\" noting that they had been family friends with the Quinlans for some years.
