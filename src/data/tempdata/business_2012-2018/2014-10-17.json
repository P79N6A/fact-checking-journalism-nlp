      "bodyText": "Raising UK interest rates soon simply isn\u2019t cricket, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has declared, in an intervention that swapped the spreadsheet for the Wisden almanack. Casting aside the welter of economic data that informs interest rate decisions, Andy Haldane instead deployed batting statistics to explain why he had changed his mind on when to hike borrowing costs. In June Haldane had invoked the front foot play of England batsman Ian Bell as he sided with an early move towards higher rates. But on Friday, the senior policymaker hailed Bell\u2019s teammate Joe Root, whose ability to stay on the back foot and play the oncoming ball late has made him a totem on the monetary policy committee as well as in the England dressing room. Haldane told an audience in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, that the weakening global economy and falling inflation meant this was no time to be lurching forward with a rate hike - with next summer now the most likely date. \u201cThree months on, it is time to update the batting averages,\u201d Haldane said. Using language that might be as incomprehensible as Gordon Brown\u2019s post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory for those who have never heard the sound of leather on willow, he added: \u201cIan Bell\u2019s batting average has remained at 45 \u2013 the front foot recovery has remained on track. But over the same period, Joe Root\u2019s has risen to 51. Cricket statisticians and financial markets are agreed. While still a close run thing, the statistics now appear to favour the back foot.\u201d His non-cricket explanation did little to increase the speech\u2019s lucidity average. \u201cOn balance, my judgement on the macro-economy has shifted the same way. I have tended to view the economy through a bi-modal lens. And recent evidence, in the UK and globally, has shifted my probability distribution towards the lower tail.\u201d He concluded: \u201cPut in rather plainer English, I am gloomier.\u201d The speech will reinforce market views that rates are unlikely to rise from their record low of 0.5% until the middle of next year. Talk of front foot and back foot play may have stumped Haldane\u2019s own captain, governor Mark Carney, a Canadian and a fan of ice hockey. Carney upset traditionalists this summer by axing the Bank\u2019s traditional game of cricket, replacing it with a more \u2018inclusive\u2019 game of rounders. Haldane\u2019s speech, entitled Twin Peaks, cited \u201cplenty of reasons to be cheerful\u201d but also \u201creasons to be fearful\u201d. Warning that Britain\u2019s economy is balanced between extremes, he said the country\u2019s economic performance \u201cappears to be writhing in both agony and ecstasy\u201d. On the upside, Haldane said growth in the UK was the fastest of the G7 advanced economies, the recession appeared to have been shallower than first thought, growth was \u201creasonably well-balanced between consumption and investment\u201d, inflation had slowed, unemployment was falling and share prices were up. But he listed three features of the UK economy that \u201cpaint a more sobering picture\u201d: falling real-wage growth; flat-lining productivity and real interest rates around 0%. Tipped as a successor to Carney, Haldane revealed that he has created an \u201cagony index\u201d, which is \u201ccurrently at painfully low levels.\u201d \u201cSuch an extended period of agony is virtually unprecedented going back to the late 1800s, with the exception of the aftermath of the world wars and the early 1970s,\u201d he said. A separate Haldane \u201cecstasy index\u201d, based on economic growth, unemployment and inflation, suggests Britain is in \u201cfine fettle.\u201d But wage growth paints a different picture, with earnings remaining stubbornly weak. Real wages have now fallen for 71 of the last 74 months. That is \u201cunprecedented since at least the mid-1800s,\u201d when W G Grace would have been picking up his first bat. \u201cRather peculiarly, the UK economy appears to be writhing in both agony and ecstasy. It is twin-peaked,\u201d Haldane declared. Two of Haldane\u2019s teammates on the monetary policy committee, the hawkish Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, are already on a sticky wicket having voted to raise rates in August and September, before UK inflation fell and global tensions rose. On Wednesday, the Bank will reveal whether they returned to the fold at October\u2019s MPC meeting. Haldane\u2019s speech follows news earlier this week of a drop in inflation to 1.2% in September, well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target. That sparked big moves in financial markets to push back bets of when the Bank\u2019s policymakers will vote to hike rates, which have been at 0.5% since 2009. Markets had until then been pricing in a significant chance of a rate hike to 0.75% in the early months of 2015, but are now looking to the summer. Haldane\u2019s words about the strains on workers will resonate with the many households who have seen their income fail to keep up with inflation. Even with inflation coming down sharply on the latest figures, wages have continued to fall in real terms. Haldane also warned that Britain was vulnerable to another explosion in the eurozone, five years since the crisis began when Greece revealed its budget deficit was twice as large as expected. He told ITV News: \u201cIt\u2019s a concern. It [the eurozone] is our biggest trading partner by far. We know we\u2019ve seen recently that any event on the continent laps back to the UK very quickly through our trade links, but also through our financial links and, indeed, increasingly just because of confidence. If confidence is ebbing on the continent, it appears to leak across here pretty quickly.\u201d This article was amended on 18 October 2014 to correct the date of an earlier speech made my Andy Haldane. The spelling of the Wisden almanack has also been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "Signs that central bankers might extend their support for the flagging global economy - possibly extending QE in the case of the US or the Bank of England not raising rates as quickly as expected - has given a boost to markets at the end of a volatile few days, writes Nick Fletcher. Better than expected Michigan consumer figures also calmed some of the recent nerves, as did an easing of bond yields in the eurozone. But David Madden at IG warned: The fear has evaporated out of the eurozone today as the bond markets have calmed down but I wouldn\u2019t get too comfortable as next week is likely to be a rocky ride. The eurozone debt crisis has a history of rearing its ugly head, Ebola has yet to be contained, China\u2019s GDP report will tell us the golden days of Chinese growth are over. Confidence in equity markets takes months to be gained but it is lost in hours. For now though markets have accentuated the positive, unlike the past few days, and so the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 114.38 points or 1.85% at 6310.29 Germany\u2019s Dax added 3.12% to 8850.27 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.92% better at 4033.18 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 3.42% to 18,700.98 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.97% higher at 9956.8 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 285 points or 1.77%. And on that note, we\u2019ll close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and don\u2019t forget our pieces looking at the five years of the eurozone crisis. We\u2019ll be back on Monday, so have a good weekend. Some afternoon reading... It\u2019s five years (tomorrow), since the eurozone crisis began, when Greece revealed that its budget deficit was a staggering 12%. Larry Elliott, our economics editor, has written about how the crisis remains unresolved: Eurozone crisis, five years on: no happy ending in sight for Greek odyssey And I\u2019ve looked back over the hundreds of live blogs we\u2019re written over half a decade... Europe in turmoil: five years of economic crisis And here\u2019s Data Blog\u2019s take: Good news for those rich Americans -- shares on Wall Street are rallying in early trading. European markets are holding their gains too - the FTSE 100 is currently up 66 points, or around 1%. The German DAX is up 1.7%, and the CAC has gained 2%. The Fed has released 12 charts to accompany Janet Yellen\u2019s speech on inequality -- they\u2019re online here. I\u2019ve picked a few out, to show the scale of wealth disparity in America. As Yellen asks, is this really compatible with a country based on opportunity? Yellen also touches on inheritance as a key factor in wealth inequality The average age for receiving an inheritance is 40, when many parents are trying to save for and secure the opportunities of higher education for their children, move up to a larger home or one in a better neighborhood, launch a business, switch careers, or perhaps relocate to seek more opportunity. ...., I think the effects of inheritances for the sizable minority below the top that receive one are likely a significant source of economic opportunity. (note those double axis on the right) Fed chair Janet Yellen has also provided stark evidence of how the richest 5% in America have become richer in the last 25 years. In her speech on inequality, she says: The wealthiest 5 percent of American households held 54 percent of all wealth reported in the 1989 survey. Their share rose to 61 percent in 2010 and reached 63 percent in 2013. By contrast, the rest of those in the top half of the wealth distribution--families that in 2013 had a net worth between $81,000 and $1.9 million--held 43 percent of wealth in 1989 and only 36 percent in 2013. The lower half of households by wealth held just 3 percent of wealth in 1989 and only 1 percent in 2013. To put that in perspective, figure 4 shows that the average net worth of the lower half of the distribution, representing 62 million households, was $11,000 in 2013. About one-fourth of these families reported zero wealth or negative net worth, and a significant fraction of those said they were \u201cunderwater\u201d on their home mortgages, owing more than the value of the home. Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, has made a dramatic intervention into the debate on inequality. Yellen, arguably the most powerful woman in the world, has questioned whether America\u2019s wealth inequality can actually be squared with its founding principles. She told a conference on Economic Opportunity and Inequality that she is \u2018greatly concerned\u2019 by the wealth inequality in America, which are at their worst in a century. The distribution of income and wealth in the United States has been widening more or less steadily for several decades, to a greater extent than in most advanced countries. This trend paused during the Great Recession because of larger wealth losses for those at the top of the distribution and because increased safety-net spending helped offset some income losses for those below the top. But widening inequality resumed in the recovery, as the stock market rebounded, wage growth and the healing of the labor market have been slow, and the increase in home prices has not fully restored the housing wealth lost by the large majority of households for which it is their primary asset. The extent of and continuing increase in inequality in the United States greatly concern me. The past several decades have seen the most sustained rise in inequality since the 19th century after more than 40 years of narrowing inequality following the Great Depression. By some estimates, income and wealth inequality are near their highest levels in the past hundred years, much higher than the average during that time span and probably higher than for much of American history before then. It is no secret that the past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority. I think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation\u2019s history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity. Here\u2019s the speech: Perspectives on Inequality and Opportunity from the Survey of Consumer Finances More to follow... Update: The European Central Bank has issued a statement on the leak of its minutes to the New York Times. It insist that the governing council was united in its handling of the Cyprus crisis, even though these minutes expose the concerns expressed by some members. It concludes: The ECB was not the supervisor and fully relied on the assessment of the Central Bank of Cyprus. Therefore to draw conclusions about the ECB\u2019s future banking supervision role on the basis of ELA to Cyprus is tendentious. 17 October 2014 - Statement on New York Times articles But...but... the leak, dammit? How did that happen?! Now this is interesting..... The New York Times appears to have been leaked the minutes of several European Central Bank governing council meetings. These minutes are meant to be kept secret for decades. But someone\u2019s passed them into the NYT. Full story. They show divisions at the heart of the ECB over how to address Cyprus\u2019s banking woes, in the months leading up to its bailout. In particularly, Germany, France and the Netherlands all expressed concern over providing help to peripheral banks, such as the Cyprus Popular Bank. The NYT says: Mr. Weidmann, the tough-talking Bundesbank head, had long styled himself as the institution\u2019s bailout scold. The minutes show him sharply opposing E.C.B.-backed rescues of the French-Belgian lender Dexia and smaller banks in Ireland, Greece and Spain. In January 2013, just two months before the controversial Cyprus rescue package, Mr. Weidmann repeated his complaint that the E.C.B. was putting itself at risk in propping up Cyprus Popular Bank \u2014 which subsequently changed its name to Laiki Bank. Moreover, Mr. Weidmann said that the value of the collateral posted at the central bank was inflated \u2014 which, if true, would allow it to secure more credit... In the end, the ECB didn\u2019t block the lifeline to Cyprus Popular Bank - and subsequently it collapsed amid the Cyprus bailout. Interesting stuff, and a major breach of security at the ECB.... More here: Before a Bailout, Doubts Over Keeping a Cyprus Bank Afloat European carmakers are rallying after data showed car sales in Europe climbed 6.1% to 1.3m vehicles last month. Shares in Renault and Volkswagen are both up 3%, and Peugeot Citreon have surged 5.5%. Europe\u2019s car market bottomed out last year, ending a six-year slump, and has been growing for 13 months. According to the Association of European Carmakers, Germany, the biggest market, saw sales rise 5.2% to 260,062. The UK, the number 2 market, was up 5.6% while France, the number 3, climbed 6.3%. Sales in Spain, Portugal and Greece surged 30% or more as buyers snapped up cars from Volkswagen, Ford and Opel. JP Morgan economist Allan Monks has pushed back his prediction for the first UK rate hike by one quarter to the second quarter of next year, following Andrew Haldane\u2019s comments today. Haldane\u2019s views have been close to the centre ground on the committee so far. He is one of the MPC\u2019s intellectual heavyweights, as well as Chief Economist, and hence we put significant weight on his comments. Although the UK data have turned more mixed, the primary driver of Haldane\u2019s shift rhetoric is global at heart. He summarizes by drawing attention to \u201cthe mark-down in global growth, heightened geo-political and financial risks and the weak pipeline of inflationary pressures from wages internally and commodity prices externally\u201d. The speech contains a lengthy discussion of the recent weakness in wages. But as we noted earlier this week, the pay data are showing tentative signs of improvement and are consistent with the BoE\u2019s August Inflation Report projections. While the odds of a 1Q15 rate increase have not completely evaporated, Haldane\u2019s comments suggest the data would need to turn stronger than we expect to deliver the first rate increase on this timescale. But we are also mindful that the global element driving Haldane\u2019s view could look rather different in a few months time. JPMorgan\u2019s global forecast is relatively upbeat, with the US projected to grow at 3% and the euro area at 2% by the early part of next year. If delivered, this path would give the MPC confidence in the UK recovery, while clearer signs of wage inflation by that time (our current view) will also help to shift perceptions of medium term inflation risks. While Jimmy Choo got its float away this morning, Virgin Money has just delayed its planned stock market listing beyond this month against a background of financial chaos. This colour-coded chart from our data blog team shows which eurozone countries have benefitted most today\u2019s revised growth data: Here\u2019s another important chart from Andy Haldane\u2019s speech, showing how higher earners have disproportionately benefitted from pay rises since 1997. Haldane says that this shows that the distribution of wages has not been static; it has widened over the past 20 years. In the late 1990s, wages for the top 10% of earners were around 6.5 times higher than the bottom 10%. Today, the figure is closer to eight. Or, put differently, in the decade prior to the recession, real wages for the top decile rose on average by 3% per year, while for the bottom decile they rose by around half that. Since the crisis, there has been an across-the-board squeeze on real wages. Those distributional differences have, however, persisted and have if anything widened further. Despite having fallen by almost 10% since the crisis, real wages among the top 10% are still over 20% higher than in 1997. But wages for the bottom 20% have fallen by almost 20% since 2007 and are essentially back to where they were in 1997. Haldane isn\u2019t the only central banker making headlines this morning. Germany\u2019s Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, has criticised those who are calling for Berlin to boost its spending to help its own economy, and the rest of the eurozone. Speaking in Riga, Weidmann claimed: \u201cThe boost to the peripheral countries from an increase in German public investment is ... likely to be negligible \u201cAnd with the economy operating at normal capacity utilisation, Germany is not in need of stimulus either \u2013 and this will remain the case with the revised forecasts that still foresee growth in line with potential.\u201d Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC has snapped up a 4.6% stake in Jimmy Choo, which debuted on the London stock market this morning. The shares are now flat at 140p. Over to the eurozone....and stats body Eurostat has updated its GDP, to get into line with international standards. The revisions account for research and development activity, and also for black market activities. And they have added an extra 3.5% to the size of the eurozone economy, and the wider EU. That should drive down the region\u2019s debt/GDP ratio, making Europe\u2019s debts look more sustainable. But the broad picture isn\u2019t changed; Europe still suffered a massive recession after Lehman Brothers collapsed, and has managed little growth since the debt crisis. Some highlights: the Netherlands GDP is 7.6% bigger than thought. Cyprus is 9.5% larger (mainly due to \u2018statistical improvements\u2019). R&amp;D has added an extra 3.5% to Ireland\u2019s GDP; those multinational tech firms making a contribution to the local economy (if not to the tax pot). But Latvia is 0.1% smaller, due to statistical improvements... More here: ESA 2010 shifts level of EU and euro area GDP upward, growth rates almost unaffected Here\u2019s more charts from this morning\u2019s Andy Haldane speech on the \u2018agony and ecstasy\u2019 of the UK economy: The relief rally continues in European stock markets. The FTSE 100 index is trading nearly 80 points higher at 6273.07, a 1.2% gain (with only five fallers on the blue-chip index in stark contrast to yesterday, when stocks were in freefall around the world). Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.8% ahead and France\u2019s CAC has added 1.9%. Wall Street futures indicate the Dow Jones will open 174 points higher... Haldane highlighted the long period of falling real wages (adjusted for inflation) in his speech this morning. He said: This has been a jobs-rich, but pay-poor, recovery. Relief is rife in the European stock markets - the main indices are a sea of green: If Haldane is right, the UK won\u2019t see an interest rate rise before next May\u2019s election. That\u2019s a relief for George Osborne and colleagues, suggests Paul Waugh of Politics Home: On the markets, Jimmy Choo made its stock market debut this morning. While the luxury brand is famous for its perilously high heels, the shares got off to a rather flat start: up 0.5p to 140.5p. They were priced at the bottom end of the price range (140p), valuing the company, owned by JAB Luxury \u2013 the investment arm of Germany\u2019s billionaire Reimann family \u2013 at \u00a3545.6m \u2013 rather than \u00a3700m as expected last month. It\u2019s early days, but there are signs that the US stock market might rally today. Investors are taking comfort in Andy Haldane\u2019s dovish comments that UK interest rates will stay lower for longer. Last night\u2019s hints from Federal Reserve policymaker Jimmy Bullard that America could maintain its QE stimulus programme for longer has also calmed nerves. Haldane also warns that Britain is vulnerable to another explosion in the eurozone crisis, telling ITV News that: \u201cIt\u2019s a concern. It [the euro area] is our biggest trading partner by far. We know we\u2019ve see recently that any event on the continent laps back to the UK very quickly through our trade links but also through our financial links and indeed increasingly just because of confidence. If confidence is ebbing on the continent, it appears to leak across here pretty quickly.\u201d Andrew Haldane has also given an interview to ITV News, in which he reiterates that he is more reluctant to consider raising interest rates than three months ago. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist says: In the global economy, certainly, we\u2019ve seen some of the energy of the recovery reduced, we\u2019ve seen global growth prospects revised down a bit and here in the UK we\u2019ve seen inflationary pressures from wages but also from oil prices, from commodity prices also heading south and those two things in combination means that I\u2019m a bit less on the front foot than I was three months ago.\u201d So when might they rise? \u201cWho knows precisely when the lift-off date [the first interest rate hike] will come. If you believe the financial markets, they\u2019re now betting somewhere in the middle of next year. Perhaps that\u2019s not a bad bet.\u201d That interview will be on ITV News at 1.30pm, 6.30pm and Ten. The pound has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar, underlining that expectations of an early rate rise have been stumped. It\u2019s trading at $1.6044 this morning. The key monetary policy message from Andy Haldane this morning is that UK interest rates will probably stay at their current record lows for longer. Having weighed up his agony and ecstasy indexes, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist turns to cricket to explain his change of view: In June, when evaluating the UK\u2019s monetary stance, I used the metaphor of a batsmen in cricket deciding whether to play off the front foot (raise rates) or the back foot (hold rates). And I compared the averages of two English batsmen, one who played from the front foot (Ian Bell), the other from the back (Joe Root), to illustrate the dilemma. At the time, Ian Bell averaged 45 to Joe Root\u2019s 43. In other words, while it was a close run thing, the data narrowly favoured the front foot. Cricketing statistics are not the sole basis for my views on the appropriate stance for UK monetary policy. Nonetheless, on balance, I felt the same front-foot judgement was appropriate for UK interest rates at the time. By contrast, if the effect on supply capacity was only temporary, lowering the measured output gap, that could imply the need for tighter policy. Three months on, it is time to update the batting averages. Ian Bell\u2019s batting average has remained at 45 \u2013 the front foot recovery has remained on track. But over the same period, Joe Root\u2019s has risen to 51. Cricket statisticians and financial markets are agreed. While still a close run thing, the statistics now appear to favour the back foot. So, Haldane won\u2019t be voting to raise interest rates soon (the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee has been split 7-2 on his issue). Rolls-Royce has warned it won\u2019t return to profit growth next year, blaming worsening economic conditions and tighter Russian trade sanctions. The shares tumbled more than 7%, or 71.5p, to 868p, making them the worst performer on the FTSE 100 in early trading. The British engineering firm said \u201ca number of customers\u201d had delayed or cancelled orders. While the company cut its revenue forecast for this year, it maintained its forecast of \u201cflat\u201d 2014 profits \u2013 but no longer expects to return to growth in 2015. Its current \u201cbest estimate\u201d is that underlying profit will be flat to 3% lower next year. Rolls-Royce is the world\u2019s second-largest aircraft engine maker behind General Electric. A calm start to Europe\u2019s stock markets, as traders digest Andy Haldane\u2019s speech (new readers start here). The German DAX has jumped by 0.6%, and the French CAC is up 0.4% The FTSE 100 is up just 3 points, dragged down by Rolls Royce which warned on revenues and profits this morning (more in a moment...) Haldane has also created an \u2018ecstasy index, based on unemployment, inflation and GDP growth in the UK. And in contrast to his agony index, this one looks quite good: He says: In only 42 of the past 144 years has the index been above current levels. So far, then, so good. The UK economy appears to be healthier than on average in the past, if perhaps not quite yet ecstatic. Certainly, it appears to be firmly on the front foot. Thus Haldane\u2019s point about Britain \u2018writhing in agony and ecstasy\u2019.... Andy Haldane has also produced an \u201cagony index\u201d for the UK, a simple index of real wages, real interest rates and productivity growth. And it shows that Britain\u2019s economy is suffering serious pain: Haldane tells his audience in Kenilworth, Warwickshire: The agony index is currently at painfully low levels. It has been around 5 percentage points below its 1970-2014 average since 2008. Such an extended period of agony is virtually unprecedented going back to the late 1800s, with the exception of the aftermath of the World Wars and the early 1970s. Andy Haldane speech is online here: Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, has warned that economic conditions have worsened. In an important intervention at the Kenilworth Chamber of Trade right now, Haldane is explaining that he is gloomier about economic prospects. He\u2019s predicting that interest rates will remain at their record lows for longer. Haldane points to slowing global growth, heightened geo-political and financial risks and the weak pipeline of inflationary pressures from wages in the UK and commodity prices worldwide. This has led Haldane -- one of the brightest central bankers around -- to push back his own expectations of when UK interest rates will need to rise. He says: Rather peculiarly, the UK economy appears to be writhing in both agony and ecstasy. It is twin-peaked. Haldane points out that the UK is in \u201cfine fettle\u201d by some measures; the strongest growth in the G7, and unemployment falling from 8.4% to 6%. But there are also \u201creasons to be fearful\u201d: Growth in real wages has been negative for all bar three of the last 74 months\u2019. \u2018The level of productivity is no higher than it was six years ago\u2019. And real interest rates are around zero. This combination of poor economic outcomes is \u2018virtually unprecedented going back to the late 1800s, with the exception of the aftermath of the world wars and the early 1970s.\u2019 And in conclusion, Haldane says: On balance, my judgement on the macro-economy has shifted the same way. I have tended to view the economy through a bi-modal lens. And recent evidence, in the UK and globally, has shifted my probability distribution towards the lower tail. Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier. I\u2019ll post some nice charts from his speech now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. There\u2019s no let- up in the panic swirling in the financial markets this morning, after the dramatic sell-offs that have racked the City in recent days. Asian stock markets have endured another ropey day, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei losing another 1.4%. That\u2019s despite St Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard suggesting yesterday that the Fed should consider delaying the end of its bond-purchase program. European markets are expected to open more calmly, although in this environment who knows? The real story could come in the bond markets. Yesterday, Greece\u2019s bonds came under heavy pressure, pushing the yield on its bonds up to 9%. Chris Weston of IG comments: The bond market looks like it has pushed Greece out (once again) of the funding markets. There are plenty more central bankers speaking today, including Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, so it could be a lively day....",

The past several decades have seen the most sustained rise in inequality since the 19th century after more than 40 years of narrowing inequality following the Great Depression.

The minutes show him sharply opposing E.C.B.-backed rescues of the French-Belgian lender Dexia and smaller banks in Ireland, Greece and Spain.</p> <p>In January 2013, just two months before the controversial Cyprus rescue package, Mr. Weidmann repeated his complaint that the E.C.B. was putting itself at risk in propping up Cyprus Popular Bank \u2014 which subsequently changed its name to Laiki Bank.</p> <p>Moreover, Mr. Weidmann said that the value of the collateral posted at the central bank was inflated \u2014 which, if true, would allow it to secure more credit...</p> </blockquote> <p>In the end, the ECB didn\u2019t block the lifeline to Cyprus Popular Bank - and subsequently it collapsed amid the Cyprus bailout.</p> <p>Interesting stuff, and a major breach of security at the ECB....<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/statuses/523078595821182976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Landonthomasjr\">@Landonthomasjr</a>&#39;s piece in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytimes\">@nytimes</a> re 2012 ELA support for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cyprus?src=hash\">#Cyprus</a>&#39; Laiki is nothing less than a bombshell for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecb\">@ecb</a>&#39;s credibility.</p>&mdash; Yannis Koutsomitis (@YanniKouts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/status/523078595821182976\">October 17, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LorcanRK/statuses/523078369748189184\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I guess the presumption has to be that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecb\">@ecb</a> minutes came from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bundesbank\">@bundesbank</a>.

He is one of the MPC\u2019s intellectual heavyweights, as well as Chief Economist, and hence we put significant weight on his comments. </p> <p>Although the UK data have turned more mixed, the primary driver of Haldane\u2019s shift rhetoric is global at heart. He summarizes by drawing attention to \u201cthe mark-down in global growth, heightened geo-political and financial risks and the weak pipeline of inflationary pressures from wages internally and commodity prices externally\u201d. The speech contains a lengthy discussion of the recent weakness in wages. <br></p> <p>But as we noted earlier this week, the pay data are showing tentative signs of improvement and are consistent with the BoE\u2019s August Inflation Report projections. While the odds of a 1Q15 rate increase have not completely evaporated, Haldane\u2019s comments suggest the data would need to turn stronger than we expect to deliver the first rate increase on this timescale. <br></p> <p>But we are also mindful that the global element driving Haldane\u2019s view could look rather different in a few months time. JPMorgan\u2019s global forecast is relatively upbeat, with the US projected to grow at 3% and the euro area at 2% by the early part of next year. If delivered, this path would give the MPC confidence in the UK recovery, while clearer signs of wage inflation by that time (our current view) will also help to shift perceptions of medium term inflation risks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5440f4efe4b0b858885aff57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-17T10:58:22.731Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While Jimmy Choo got its float away this morning,<strong> Virgin Money has just delayed its planned stock market listing beyond this month against a background of financial chaos.</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5440f4bee4b0d81d4881b356\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-17T10:53:34.342Z\">11.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This colour-coded chart from our data blog team shows which eurozone countries have benefitted most today\u2019s revised growth data:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlbertoNardelli/statuses/523063547606364160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Impact of eurozone 2010 GDP revisions by country: <a href=\"http://t.co/obLUQpKjGc\">pic.twitter.com/obLUQpKjGc</a></p>&mdash; Alberto Nardelli (@AlbertoNardelli) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlbertoNardelli/status/523063547606364160\">October 17, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5440ef9ee4b02f15ae75788e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-17T10:49:18.161Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s another important chart from Andy Haldane\u2019s speech, showing how higher earners have disproportionately benefitted from pay rises since 1997.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8aca820aee974455020e09a52824797ffc661442\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/17/1413542866330/179fa789-dcbc-4dbd-aa06-8b7d2b7b8955-460x333.png\" alt=\"Andy Haldane chart on wages\" width=\"460\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Haldane chart on wages</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bank of England</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Haldane says that this shows that the distribution of wages has not been static; it has widened over the past 20 years.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the late 1990s, wages for the top 10% of earners were around 6.5 times higher than the bottom 10%.

Despite having fallen by almost 10% since the crisis, real wages among the top 10% are still over 20% higher than in 1997.

In other words, while it was a close run thing, the data narrowly favoured the front foot. Cricketing statistics are not the sole basis for my views on the appropriate stance for UK monetary policy. Nonetheless, on balance, I felt the same front-foot judgement was appropriate for UK interest rates at the time. </p> <p>By contrast, if the effect on supply capacity was only temporary, lowering the measured output gap, that could imply the need for <em>tighter </em>policy. </p> <p>Three months on, it is time to update the batting averages. Ian Bell\u2019s batting average has remained at 45 \u2013 the front foot recovery has remained on track. But over the same period, Joe Root\u2019s has risen to 51. Cricket statisticians and financial markets are agreed. While still a close run thing, the statistics now appear to favour the back foot.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fffe988e72b0d1ee64c03ec88331829cb1529bc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/17/1413531034960/21bf1f85-8e83-449b-9e40-6df4d471236e-460x322.jpeg\" alt=\"England's Joe Root.\" width=\"460\" height=\"322\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s Joe Root.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PAUL ELLIS/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, Haldane won\u2019t be voting to raise interest rates soon (the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee has been split 7-2 on his issue).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KingEconomist/statuses/523010654492692481\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>It seems unlikely that BoE&#39;s Andy Haldane is on the same wavelength as Martin &quot;wages are about to take off&quot; Weale: <a href=\"http://t.co/d6uerOnbq3\">http://t.co/d6uerOnbq3</a></p>&mdash; Stephen King (@KingEconomist) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingEconomist/status/523010654492692481\">October 17, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-17T10:50:05.473Z\">at 11.50am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5440c351e4b0cd82a095fa35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-17T07:23:10.880Z\">8.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rolls-Royce has warned it won\u2019t return to profit growth next year</strong>, blaming worsening economic conditions and tighter Russian trade sanctions.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chances of an early rise in UK interest rates have fallen, says the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andrew Haldane, who admits he is \u201cgloomier\u201d about the prospects for the economy than he was a few months ago. In a speech on Friday morning, which will reinforce market views that rates are unlikely to rise from their record low of 0.5% until the middle of next year, Haldane said: \u201cThat reflects the mark-down in global growth, heightened geo-political and financial risks and the weak pipeline of inflationary pressures from wages internally and commodity prices externally. \u201cTaken together, this implies interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago, without endangering the inflation target,\u201d said Haldane, a member of the Bank\u2019s nine-member interest rate setting committee. The prospect that interest rates will stay lower for longer sent sterling tumbling on the foreign exchanges, with the pound losing half a cent against the dollar. Haldane also warned that Britain was vulnerable to another explosion in the eurozone crisis. He told ITV News: \u201cIt\u2019s a concern. It [the eurozone] is our biggest trading partner by far. We know we\u2019ve seen recently that any event on the continent laps back to the UK very quickly through our trade links, but also through our financial links and, indeed, increasingly just because of confidence. If confidence is ebbing on the continent, it appears to leak across here pretty quickly.\u201d In June, Haldane had put even weight on moving interest rates sooner and moving them later. He used the cricketing terms \u201cbeing on the front foot\u201d and being on the \u201cback foot\u201d. On Friday, he said: \u201cWhile still a close-run thing, the statistics now appear to favour the back foot. Recent evidence, in the UK and globally, has shifted my probability distribution towards the lower tail. Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier.\u201d His speech to the Kenilworth Chamber of Trade in Warwickshire, entitled Twin Peaks, cites \u201cplenty of reasons to be cheerful\u201d but also \u201creasons to be fearful\u201d. On the upside, Haldane says growth in the UK is the fastest of the G7 advanced economies, the recession appears to have been shallower than first thought, growth is \u201creasonably well-balanced between consumption and investment\u201d, inflation has slowed, unemployment is falling and share prices are up. But he lists three features of the UK economy that \u201cpaint a more sobering picture\u201d: falling real-wage growth, flat-lining productivity and real interest rates around zero per cent. Explaining the impact of those features, he said: \u201cThese indicators clearly have an important bearing on macro-economic health: among workers, whose disposable incomes have fallen materially below their pre-crisis levels; among savers, the rates of return on whose assets have fallen materially below their pre-crisis levels and are near-zero in inflation-adjusted terms; and among companies, whose underlying efficiency has flatlined since the crisis.\u201d Haldane has drawn up an \u201cagony index\u201d for the UK, a simple index of real wages, real interest rates and productivity growth. He said: \u201cThe agony index is currently at painfully low levels. It has been around 5 percentage points below its 1970-2014 average since 2008. \u201cSuch an extended period of agony is virtually unprecedented going back to the late 1800s, with the exception of the aftermath of the world wars and the early 1970s.\u201d Haldane\u2019s speech follows news earlier this week of a drop in inflation to 1.2% in September, well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target. That sparked big moves in financial markets to push back bets of when the Bank\u2019s policymakers will vote to hike rates, which have been at 0.5% since 2009. Markets had until then been pricing in a significant chance of a rate hike to 0.75% in the early months of 2015, but are now looking to the summer. Haldane\u2019s words about the strains on workers will resonate with the many households who have seen their income fail to keep up with inflation. Even with inflation coming down sharply on the latest figures, wages have continued to fall in real terms. \u201cGrowth in real wages has been negative for all bar three of the past 74 months. The cumulative fall in real wages since their pre-recession peak is around 10%. As best we can tell, the length and depth of this fall is unprecedented since at least the mid-1800s,\u201d said Haldane. \u201cThis has been a jobs-rich, but pay-poor, recovery.\u201d He was cautious about the longer-term outlook for the economy, noting that the monetary policy committee had been over-optimistic in the past. \u201cThe MPC, in common with every other mainstream forecaster, has been forecasting sunshine tomorrow in every year since 2008 \u2013 that is, rising real wages, productivity and real interest rates. The heatwave has failed to materialise. The timing of the upturn has been repeatedly put back.\u201d He said the mixed picture would be around for some time. \u201cIf this story of a growing, but diverging, economy is right, then the message is clear. Forecasts of both macro-economic sunshine and showers, tales of both agony and ecstasy, sightings of both the upper and lower peaks, may be here for some time to come.\u201d",

Even with inflation coming down sharply on the latest figures, wages have continued to fall in real terms.</p> <p>\u201cGrowth in real wages has been negative for all bar three of the past 74 months. The cumulative fall in real wages since their pre-recession peak is around 10%. As best we can tell, the length and depth of this fall is unprecedented since at least the mid-1800s,\u201d said Haldane. \u201cThis has been a jobs-rich, but pay-poor, recovery.\u201d</p> <p>He was cautious about the longer-term outlook for the economy, noting that the monetary policy committee had been over-optimistic in the past.</p> <p>\u201cThe MPC, in common with every other mainstream forecaster, has been forecasting sunshine tomorrow in every year since 2008 \u2013 that is, rising real wages, productivity and real interest rates. The heatwave has failed to materialise. The timing of the upturn has been repeatedly put back.\u201d</p> <p>He said the mixed picture would be around for some time.</p> <p>\u201cIf this story of a growing, but diverging, economy is right, then the message is clear. Forecasts of both macro-economic sunshine and showers, tales of both agony and ecstasy, sightings of both the upper and lower peaks, may be here for some time to come.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Over the past decade, as part-time employment in Australia has become more common, concerns have been raised about the casualisation of Australia\u2019s workforce. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows that while the overall proportion of casual labour remains steady, there has been a sharp rise in the level of under-30s employed in a casual arrangement. Given casual workers have less income security and are denied access to benefits such as sick and annual leave, this increase is a concern as it could be a signal that such work is to become more common for all adults. </p> <p>This increase in youth working in casual labour is balanced alongside new research which shows that up to a third of workers under 35 are choosing to do some form of freelance work due to the flexibility such work provides them. </p> <p>The survey released on Thursday of 1,049 adults, conducted by Edelman Berland on behalf of the online workplace company Elance-oDesk, suggests that up to 30% of Australians are doing some form of freelance work. The findings show that both workers under 35 and those over 55 are most likely to be freelancers. </p> <p>The survey takes a much broader view of freelancing than the ABS. Whereas the ABS measures only those for whom freelancing is their main source of income \u2013 typically independent contractors \u2013 this study included all workers who had \u201cengaged in supplemental, temporary, project or contract-based work, within the past 12 months\u201d.</p> <p>This includes people who may work full-time but who \u201cmoonlight\u201d as a freelancer, people who work part-time in traditional employment but who also diversify their income by doing freelance work, and people who may be working for an employer, but are doing so for a temporary contracted period:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/83ZaY/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This broader definition thus in some ways takes into account the underemployment side of the labour market, where workers are seeking extra work because their current jobs are not providing enough income. </p> <p>Indeed overwhelmingly, the research found that the main reason people chose to freelance was \u201cto earn extra money\u201d. 55% of those surveyed gave that as their reason for freelancing, with 40% suggesting it was the ability to have a flexible schedule, and just over 30% stating that being be able to choose their own projects was a primary motivator. </p> <p>Overall, for 58% of those surveyed who freelanced, they did so out of choice rather than necessity, and 75% of those who did not freelance said they would be willing to do additional work outside of their primary job if it was available and enabled them to make more money.</p> <p>The research also found that both freelancers and non-freelance workers valued a good work-life balance, but that non-freelancers regarded it as more important. Freelancers however, regarded the flexibility to work when and where they wanted and the chance to earn \u201chigh pay\u201d more than did non-freelancers. Non-freelance workers on the other hand were significantly more concerned about being paid an appropriate amount for their skill level. </p> <p>The research also looked at what workers of various ages considered important in their work. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it found younger workers \u2013 those under 35 year of age \u2013 were more interested in the opportunity to learn new skills and to work on \u201cinteresting projects\u201d than were older workers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/9RGMD/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And yet older workers were more interested than younger workers in flexibility and being able to \u201ccontrol their destiny\u201d. </p> <p>This confluence of differing reasons could be why both workers under 35 and workers over 55 are more likely to freelance.
