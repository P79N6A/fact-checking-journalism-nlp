      "bodyText": "Never one to miss a photo-opportunity, Ryanair boss, Michael O\u2019Leary, jumped up on to a plinth inside Belfast\u2019s Europa hotel. Goofing around like a child, he pretended to be a plane, his arms stuck out like wings. It was March 2016 and O\u2019Leary was at the Europa, repeatedly attacked during the Troubles, to mark Ryanair\u2019s return to Northern Ireland. The assembled guests, including MPs and leading business figures, stood, mouths agape, as O\u2019Leary seized the moment with his clowning antics. Which paid off as the plane pose was captured by a photographer before going viral. One Irish aircraft industry insider, present at the Europa, recalls: \u201cHe just did it on the spur of the movement when all the guests were mingling and chatting over their teas and coffees. He instantly grabbed everyone\u2019s attention and got the shot he wanted.\u201d For the first time in his career, perhaps, O\u2019Leary might feel there\u2019s just too much attention now directed his way. The last seven days must certainly have been among the grimmest for Ryanair and its colourful CEO. The cancellation of approximately 20,000 flights from the end of October to next March has dealt a huge blow to the carrier\u2019s reputation for delivering passengers on time, at the cheapest price, to destinations all over Europe. The massive disruption to Ryanair\u2019s services was brought about because of an error with pilot holiday rotas and it is O\u2019Leary who is taking the flak from both the company\u2019s shareholders and the estimated 400,000 passengers affected. Can the ebullient, controversial and combative O\u2019Leary survive the turbulence? One of his main rivals and fellow Irish aviation chief, Willie Walsh, seems to think so. The CEO of International Airlines Group, the conglomerate that owns British Airways, said he believes O\u2019Leary and Ryanair will bounce back from the disaster. Speaking at an aviation conference last Thursday, Walsh said O\u2019Leary would learn from the mistakes made over the \u201cmess-up\u201d about pilots\u2019 leave. \u201cThe mix-up came as a great surprise to everybody,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cBut whatever the screw-up, their ability to fix things and move forward is unparalleled. I would have loved to have been able to sit there and watch what was going on \u2013 although I\u2019m sure the blood on the walls has been washed off now \u2013 but I don\u2019t take any pleasure out of it.\u201d Walsh has been bloodied and battered himself in the commercial battles O\u2019Leary\u2019s Ryanair waged over the years with Aer Lingus, which Walsh used to run. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our fair share of problems and I don\u2019t get any pleasure at people laughing at me when I have a problem. I\u2019m therefore not going to laugh when someone else has a problem,\u201d said Walsh, not entirely free, perhaps, of schadenfreude. O\u2019Leary\u2019s entry into the airline industry came about through the unlikely corridor of accountancy. A graduate of Trinity College Dublin, he was hired in 1987 to manage the personal tax affairs of Tony Ryan, who then ran Guinness Peat Aviation. A few years earlier, he\u2019d co-founded Ryanair and, having been recruited, O\u2019Leary rose through the ranks until he was promoted to chief executive in 1994. His accountant\u2019s eye for slashing costs and saving cash led him to create the low-budget model, where, even during this crisis-ridden weekend, Ryanair is offering flights (at least on those routes still operating) for \u00a39.99. The financial strategy he pioneered is to use revenue generated from on-board shopping, car hire, hotel bookings and even internet gaming to replace the stream of profits from putting bums on aircraft seats. O\u2019Leary has also successfully negotiated reduced landing fees with airports across Europe, some of which happen to be a considerable distance from city centres. His success has made him one of Ireland\u2019s wealthiest men, with an estimated worth of around \u20ac700m. Despite his fortune, he lives with his wife, Anita, in Westmeath. Unlike other mega-rich Irish tycoons or pop stars, O\u2019Leary points out that he resides in the country where he was born and pays its taxes. His passion, outside mowing down other airlines and maintaining \u2013 now saving? \u2013 Ryanair\u2019s reputation as the most famous budget airline on the planet, is horse racing. His horses, War of Attrition (in 2006) and Don Cossack (in 2016), won the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He also owns a Grand National winner, appropriately called Rule the World, which took the prize in 2016. Perhaps that is why whenever one of Ryanair\u2019s aircraft touches down early at an airport the Tannoy system plays the bugle call more associated with the racecourse. Yet O\u2019Leary insists, with his accountant\u2019s hat on, that he never gambles, not even on his beloved horses. Frugality is a way of life is the suggestion, though he likes the buzz of a fight. At home, he has enjoyed taking on the big institutions. He once described Irish public broadcaster RTE as a \u201crat-infested North Korean union shop\u201d. Even a former Irish government minister, the highly regarded Mary O\u2019Rourke, has admitted that O\u2019Leary\u2019s personalised blasts against local politicians \u201cmade her cry\u201d. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s party, Fianna F\u00e1il, has demanded that in the aftermath of the flight cancellation debacle, O\u2019Leary should be summoned to explain himself to a D\u00e1il parliamentary committee. Given his penchant for free publicity, he might be tempted to square up to his political critics on television. He has questioned climate change and the airline industry\u2019s role in global warming. After 9/11 and, later, the plot to bring down transatlantic planes with liquid weapons, O\u2019Leary criticised enhanced counter-terrorist measures such as the ban on taking water and toothpaste through airport security. Alan Ruddock, the late author of Michael O\u2019Leary: A Life in Full Flight, quoted the Ryanair boss as saying that the terrorists \u201cmust be rolling around the caves of Pakistan laughing. We are not in danger of dying at the hands of toiletries.\u201d He can be gregarious and fun in company. One reporter who joked to him that he should turn up, guerrilla fashion, for photo-ops at plane steps, delivering gentle kicks to the behinds of passengers to hurry them on to the aircraft, was taken back by O\u2019Leary\u2019s apparent enthusiasm for the idea. It would take a deal of chutzpah to go through with the idea at the moment. In terms of all the airports affected by Ryanair\u2019s decision to suspend flights, Belfast International Airport comes off worst. Prior to last week\u2019s cancellation catastrophe, O\u2019Leary\u2019s airline operated 35 flights between Belfast International and Gatwick. As for the pilots themselves, O\u2019Leary has never sought to curry favour with the men and women who take his millions of passengers from A to B nearly every day of the year. \u201cI don\u2019t like aeroplanes. I never wanted to be a pilot like those other platoons of goons who populate the air industry,\u201d he has said. However, the worst calamity to hit the European airline industry for some years has exposed O\u2019Leary\u2019s position as Ryanair CEO like never before. There are reports that a board meeting last Monday in Dublin was incredibly fractious and O\u2019Leary only just survived moves to push him off his pedestal. After hijacked jets smashed into the World Trade Center and planes became a new weapon for terrorists, O\u2019Leary enlisted none other than Winston Churchill in the battle to keep people flying. Standing beside an actor posing as Britain\u2019s wartime leader, complete with bowler hat and ubiquitous cigar, O\u2019Leary paraphrased one of Churchill\u2019s rallying calls to the British people in a Ryanair advertisement. \u201cWe shall fly them to the beaches. We shall fly them to the hills. We shall fly them to London.\u201d O\u2019Leary will need even more than that Churchillian spirit to win back the faith of millions of customers. THE O\u2019LEARY FILE Born In Kanturk, County Cork, in 1961, the second child of a family of six to middle-class parents Ted and Ger O\u2019Leary. Educated at Clongowes College and, later, Trinity College Dublin, where he read economic and social studies. Best of times In May, Ryanair announced that in 2016 it had made a net profit of \u20ac503m. Two months after that profit report, O\u2019Leary said: \u201cIn 1987, Ryanair had no passengers. This year. we will have 130 million. We\u2019re an Irish airline but we are the world\u2019s biggest international airline by passenger numbers.\u201d Worst of times In the face of the recent mutiny of pilots over leave owed to them, O\u2019Leary has admitted that this has been \u201cone of the toughest weeks\u201d for Ryanair. Characteristically, however, he also said: \u201cIt\u2019s not my biggest cock-up. I have a litany of cock-ups in Ryanair over the past 25 years.\u201d What he says \u201cPeople say the customer is always right, but you know what? They\u2019re not. Sometimes, they are wrong and need to be told so.\u201d What others say \u201cPromise you won\u2019t tell lies.\u201d RTE broadcaster Joe Duffy to O\u2019Leary during a live radio interview.",

      "bodyText": "It was a week of another lot of bad polls for the government, but it also brought good economic news and remains a very stark reminder that the next election will be a tough one for the Labor party to win. Normally, commentary on polls is considered among the lowest form of political analysis since it tends to explain politics as a horse race, but having set the parameters himself, such commentary is expected with Malcolm Turnbull. When he challenged the then prime minister Tony Abbott in 2015, he said the government had \u201clost 30 Newspolls in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their mind about Mr Abbott\u2019s leadership.\u201d The fact that this week the Turnbull government has lost its 20th Newspoll in a row now takes on greater significance. But the ALP really needs to hold off popping any champagne corks, for there was also some economic news this week that highlighted how the election was a long way from being lost for the government. It has announced the final outcome for the 2015-16 budget. The deficit has come in at $33.2bn \u2013 about $4.4bn better than what was expected just four months ago when the May budget predicted a $37.6bn deficit. The 2016-17 budget was the last one the ALP had a crack at predicting \u2013 in Wayne Swan\u2019s last budget, he forecast a $6.5bn surplus \u2013 equal to 0.4% of GDP. Clearly that did not happen. But the Liberal party can\u2019t get too carried away with its foresight. Joe Hockey\u2019s budget update, done after the 2013 election, forecast a deficit for 2016-17 of $17.7bn, which was lowered to $10.6bn in Hockey\u2019s first budget, only to increase in his second one to $25.8bn. And then in the actual 2016-17 budget last year, Scott Morrison forecast a deficit of of $37.1bn. This is thus the first budget result since 2009-10 that has turned out better than what was forecast. In 2009, Swan predicted that the 2009-10 budget would have a $57.6bn deficit \u2013 it turned out the extremely pessimistic estimates of the global financial crisis impact were slightly too dire. The end result was a deficit of \u201cjust\u201d $54.5bn. Since then, every time the treasurer has stood to announce an estimated budget deficit for the following financial year, the result has beena larger deficit. That we still have a deficit of $33bn as well as $322bn in net debt \u2013 the highest ever \u2013 does suggest we are hardly in boom times, but clearly things are improving. The reason can mostly be put down to higher than expected revenue. While government expenditure was $1.2bn lower than predicted in May \u2013 largely owing to $886m less being spent on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, revenue was $4.1bn more than expected for that same month. A big chunk of that was because of an extra $2bn in non-tax receipts \u2013 with a bit of a billion of that due to \u201cadjustments for medicines subject to commercial pricing arrangements under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme\u201d. The government also did better in terms of taxes from superannuation funds \u2013 6.3% more than expected in May, which yielded an extra $488m. But while company taxes were only 0.9% above forecasts, they accounted for another $590m, resulting in the biggest one-year jump in company tax revenue in five years. In 2012-13 and 2013-14, company tax revenue rose just 0.5%, and in 2014-15 and 2015-16, it went backwards. In the past financial year, however, it has risen 8.7% \u2013 the second biggest increase in a decade. The main reason for this is that while in last year\u2019s budget the forecast for iron ore prices was $55 a tonne, in this year\u2019s budget papers the discussion was about what would happen if the price fell to that level. So yes, the government will talk about spending restraint, but budget balances are a heck of a lot easier to improve if revenue goes up. And revenue usually goes up when things are going well. But one area where revenue has not performed very well is individual income tax. The rise of 3.6% is the worst in seven years, and reflects the very low wage growth. Things might finally be starting to improve on this front, however. On Thursday, the latest job vacancy figures released by the ABS showed that on average across Australia, there were just 3.6 unemployed per vacancy \u2013 the lowest since May 2012. In New South Wales, there are just 2.6 unemployed per vacancy \u2013 a historic low. In Victoria, it is 3.7 \u2013 the best result since 2011. That is a very strong sign that the solid employment growth will continue and there is an extremely good chance higher wage growth will follow. The ALP has been riding high on a combination of good policy initiatives and an economy that has improved mostly in non-household areas. But that is less and less the case. The political hard heads in the Labor party would do well to realise that if employment continues to improve, and this translates into higher wages, households will finally begin to see an improvement in their standard of living. Once that occurs, the ALP\u2019s policies aimed at inequality, while no less valid, will become a harder sell. We should not, however, underestimate the ability of this government to shoot itself in the foot. After all, it has ministers and backbenchers who advocated for the marriage equality postal survey but who now complain about the active campaign of the yes side and argue that free speech means two songs should be played at the NRL grand final \u2013 one pro-marriage equality and one against. So we\u2019re not talking about the sharpest tools in the shed. Indeed, the ALP\u2019s best hope is that these same blunt tools will use the run of bad polls as a reason to move against Turnbull and essentially hand the election to Shorten. The economy, though, is certainly improving. And while you can argue just how much of a role the government has had to play \u2013 such argy-bargy is largely meaningless if people\u2019s wages begin to improve. The Coalition will start getting the credit and the ALP will need to adjust its pitch and policies to adapt to a different economic picture.",

When he challenged the then prime minister Tony Abbott in 2015, he said the government had \u201clost 30 Newspolls in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their mind about Mr Abbott\u2019s leadership.\u201d The fact that this week the Turnbull government has lost its 20th Newspoll in a row now takes on greater significance.</p> <p> </p> <p>But the ALP really needs to hold off popping any champagne corks, for there was also some economic news this week that highlighted how the election was a long way from being lost for the government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/06/scott-morrison-says-gdp-figures-show-economy-moving-towards-balanced-growth\">Scott Morrison claims 'better days ahead' for Australian economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p> It has announced the final outcome for the 2015-16 budget. The deficit has come in at $33.2bn \u2013 about $4.4bn better than what was expected just four months ago when the May budget predicted a $37.6bn deficit. </p> <p>The 2016-17 budget was the last one the ALP had a crack at predicting \u2013 in Wayne Swan\u2019s last budget, he forecast a $6.5bn surplus \u2013 equal to 0.4% of GDP. Clearly that did not happen.</p> <p>But the Liberal party can\u2019t get too carried away with its foresight. Joe Hockey\u2019s budget update, done after the 2013 election, forecast a deficit for 2016-17 of $17.7bn, which was lowered to $10.6bn in Hockey\u2019s first budget, only to increase in his second one to $25.8bn. And then in the actual 2016-17 budget last year, Scott Morrison forecast a deficit of of $37.1bn.</p> <p>This is thus the first budget result since 2009-10 that has turned out better than what was forecast. </p> <p> In 2009, Swan predicted that the 2009-10 budget would have a $57.6bn deficit \u2013 it turned out the extremely pessimistic estimates of the global financial crisis impact were slightly too dire. The end result was a deficit of \u201cjust\u201d $54.5bn.</p> <p>Since then, every time the treasurer has stood to announce an estimated budget deficit for the following financial year, the result has beena larger deficit.</p> <p>That we still have a deficit of $33bn as well as $322bn in net debt \u2013 the highest ever \u2013 does suggest we are hardly in boom times, but clearly things are improving.</p> <p>The reason can mostly be put down to higher than expected revenue. While government expenditure was $1.2bn lower than predicted in May \u2013 largely owing to $886m less being spent on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, revenue was $4.1bn more than expected for that same month. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/21/newspoll-has-labor-leading-coalition-54-to-46-in-two-party-terms\">Newspoll has Labor leading Coalition 54% to 46% in two-party terms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A big chunk of that was because of an extra $2bn in non-tax receipts \u2013 with a bit of a billion of that due to \u201cadjustments for medicines subject to commercial pricing arrangements under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme\u201d.</p> <p>The government also did better in terms of taxes from superannuation funds \u2013 6.3% more than expected in May, which yielded an extra $488m. </p> <p>But while company taxes were only 0.9% above forecasts, they accounted for another $590m, resulting in the biggest one-year jump in company tax revenue in five years. </p> <p>In 2012-13 and 2013-14, company tax revenue rose just 0.5%, and in 2014-15 and 2015-16, it went backwards. In the past financial year, however, it has risen 8.7% \u2013 the second biggest increase in a decade. </p> <p>The main reason for this is that while in last year\u2019s budget the forecast for iron ore prices was $55 a tonne, in this year\u2019s budget papers the discussion was about what would happen if the price <em>fell</em> to that level. </p> <p>So yes, the government will talk about spending restraint, but budget balances are a heck of a lot easier to improve if revenue goes up.

      "bodyText": "A warning from the Bank of England last week that the banking sector could lose as much as \u00a330bn in unpaid debt from credit cards, personal loans and car finance if interest rates and unemployment were to rise sharply was only the latest shot across the industry\u2019s bows. During the summer months individual central bank executives made speeches to that effect and the main consumer finance regulator has talked about tackling the worst excesses of the loan business. The conclusion must be that policymakers are well aware of a potential consumer-lending bubble and we can all sleep soundly in our beds. However, in offices around London\u2019s Old Street station, e-finance entrepreneurs are mulling over the metrics behind consumer lending and the way technology can allow high street banks and a new breed of \u201cfintech\u201d firms to target juicy opportunities. In this market, \u201copportunities\u201d is another word for a class of customer who has found themself excluded from cheap credit by outmoded, outdated, old-fashioned thinking. It raises the question: who are the regulators watching when they tell us all is well? The usual suspects is the answer \u2013 which is distressing, to say the least. From the bankers\u2019 standpoint, it is easy to see why the best brains are being put to use thinking up ways to expand consumer credit. While ultra-low interest rates and state subsidy in the form of help to buy have supported home-loan lending, the mortgage market is operating under strict rules. The financial crash of 2008 was a tale of sub-prime mortgages sold to poor people and resold to investors in a complex web of derivatives that few understood. When a few banks pushed things too far, mostly in America but with the UK\u2019s Northern Rock among them, the regulators determined that most of the debt couldn\u2019t be verified and was therefore worthless. Ten years later, it is difficult to sell a mortgage to anyone who cannot supply a 10% deposit and provide guarantees of permanent employment. There is a limit to the number of people who can satisfy this demand, especially when the government\u2019s austerity measures and only modest business investment have spawned an economy based on insecure employment, while the failure to build new homes has forced thousands into rented accommodation. How can a bank generate loans to the under-40s when so many appear to have little in the way of secure employment, or mortgage equity, or both? The UK has already seen a rise in self-employment to 15% of the workforce. More than a million women have joined the workforce in England since 1996, many of them with little credit history. Within a decade, 40% of households could be in rented accommodation. What a bank can do is turn to the physics graduates who developed the systems that brought the financial world to its knees in 2008 and ask them to be innovative again. Few will be surprised to learn that Goldman Sachs is a leading light in the search for ways to lend to US consumers. Like so many of its rivals, the firm has spotted the self-employed consultant \u2013 a group whose numbers are growing, and who have struggled under existing lending rules to secure credit \u2013 as a target for cheap loans. Upstart credit ratings agencies are developing software that can discern which consultant is worth enticing with a flexible loan and which is not. Goldman Sachs is these days not so much a bank as a technology company. Hundreds of online retailers could soon be offering loans to buy their goods using digital purses or even digital currencies. In the US, the number of people taking out unsecured loans jumped more than 15% to 15.8 million in 2016 from 13.7 million a year earlier and is now at the highest level since 2009, according to credit data agency TransUnion. In the UK, consumer credit has been growing at 10% a year for the past three years, while the mortgage market has flatlined. Of course, the banks and the hundreds of fintech firms playing the credit game should be wary given the regulator\u2019s warnings. They should, but they won\u2019t be. There is so much money in play, given to them by global savers in bucketloads. And there is the securitisation market. Just as happened in the early 2000s, loans are increasingly resold in packages, or securities, for investors to buy. The mortgage-backed securities market was at the heart of the last crash. Will a securities market based on consumer loans be at the heart of the next? Once the high street banks and a new breed of players targeting the young, old, poor and self-employed have sold on the loans, they will have little reason to care whether customers default. It means that when they recycle the next bunch of loans through the money markets they can extend their reach beyond the most secure lending risks, knowing someone else in the chain will pick up the tab if something goes wrong. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, recognised the trend in a speech on Friday. She said that regulators were capable of spotting credit trends and keeping lenders in check. Unfortunately, their efforts last time were found wanting and the suspicion must be that they will again.",

      "bodyText": "Eddie McFall has spent 18 years working at Bombardier\u2019s Belfast factory, most recently on the C-Series plane at the heart of the firm\u2019s high-profile trade dispute in the US. McFall said the mood on the shop floor was \u201csurprisingly good\u201d, despite the US commerce department\u2019s plan to slap a 219% tariff on sales of the C Series to Delta Air Lines following a complaint by rival Boeing. But he and his colleagues have little faith in Theresa May riding to their rescue or being able to persuade the US president, Donald Trump, to back down. \u201cIn Belfast, we are in a bad position. We have no local representation in Stormont. The DUP [Democratic Unionist party] are too busy propping up a failing government, which has still to get to grips with what Brexit really means. Then there\u2019s Trump being Trump,\u201d McFall said. \u201cMy own personal assessment is that Boeing is playing on Trump\u2019s protectionist policies and basically trying their arm.\u201d The Bombardier dispute seemed to sum up the difficulties Britain faces in its quest to boost exports just as the world\u2019s major trading blocs adopt protectionist policies. Trump and his commerce secretary, the billionaire financier Wilbur Ross, are single-minded in their determination to protect US blue-collar jobs from being undercut by foreign competitors that benefit from unfair subsidies. Unfortunately for McFall and the other 4,000 workers making the wings for the C Series, the enforcement and compliance branch of the commerce department\u2019s international trade administration says that Canadian subsidies amount to $10m per plane, in clear breach of international rules. Officials said that dumping occurs \u201cwhen a foreign producer sells a product in the United States at a price that is below that producer\u2019s sales price in the country of origin (\u2018home market\u2019), or at a price that is lower than the cost of production\u201d. In Bombardier\u2019s case, it said both definitions of dumping apply. Adding to the pain, the World Trade Organisation has stepped in to investigate, which suggests there is a case to answer. Not all is lost. Bombardier has a $1.1bn contract that airBaltic is close to signing, which could keep the factory in good shape while the US dispute rumbles on. But what about a post-Brexit world, where a Canadian company with a British factory that is accused of selling $30m planes for $20m runs up against EU anti-dumping rules and intense lobbying from Airbus? The answer from the free market thinktanks is simple: stop subsidising industries. A new thinktank to promote a more open, buccaneering spirit, the Institute for Free Trade (IFT), argues that we would all be better off if companies were forced to stand on their own two feet. Before the launch of the IFT, its president, Daniel Hannan, the Tory MEP and Brexit cheerleader, said the way to solve the Bombardier case was for Britain to quit the EU. Unshackled, it could secure a free-trade deal with the US that would eliminate the incentive to impose tariffs. It would also allow the UK to retaliate with all its might, unrestrained by officials in Brussels. In this way, Hannan has it both ways. But the logical conclusion of the argument made by the IFT \u2013 which enjoyed the presence of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and trade minister, Liam Fox, at its launch \u2013 is set out by the Cardiff University economics professor Patrick Minford, who acknowledges that a British economy without government subsidies would have most of its agriculture and manufacturing sectors wiped out. That\u2019s because everyone is subsidising their major industries in some form, albeit less obviously than the Canadians have with Bombardier. Even Boeing receives subsidies, in the form of overpriced defence contracts and government-backed insurance covering export orders. Most countries will channel huge sums of money through universities that find their way, in the name of innovation and research, into the revenues of private companies. Academics who monitor trade are incredulous at the naivety of the free market argument. British exports, they say, would be crushed. Nigel Driffield, professor of international business at Warwick Business School, said: \u201cBoth sides of the Atlantic seem to think that a free-trade deal would solve the industrial problems posed by Sheffield and Pittsburgh. But when it comes to which steelworks will survive, there can be only one winner.\u201d Trump might say that he is in favour of a deal with the UK, but an America First slogan puts the likes of Boeing in the driving seat. Driffield is also sceptical that life outside a major trading bloc such as the EU will be easy. All the studies of trade show that a shared history matters, but geography is more important. \u201cEvery empirical study shows that it does [matter], probably more than economic theory would lead us to believe.\u201d A trade deal with the EU is also an element of the free marketers\u2019 aims, along with deals that give access to India, China and the major developing nations of Russia, South Africa and Mexico. Detailed studies show that deals are easier to construct with nations at a similar level of development. Otherwise, governments seek to protect industries that are either fledgling and in need of a little nurturing or are large employers. Jaideep Prabhu, professor of marketing at Cambridge university\u2019s Judge Business School, says that a historical connection with India is difficult to capitalise on when the country\u2019s economy has only recently achieved the level of homogeneity seen across the EU. \u201cIndia would appear to be more integrated than the EU, but it is only in the last few months that it has extended being a political unit to being an economic unit with a single sales tax. Not so long ago each state had its own customs rules and lorries stopped at state borders to pay the local tax.\u201d It is a measure of how much catching up there is for some countries to do before they enter into what UK officials would consider a free trade deal. There are also the protectionist tendencies of the Indian government and the likelihood of demands for free movement of labour that would accompany any deal. Prabhu advises companies on their international marketing strategies. He says: \u201cWhat is the UK\u2019s bargaining power in a post-Brexit world? Not much. India will not be opening its markets any time soon. \u201cIn a trade deal you have to give something to get something, and it\u2019s not clear what the UK would have to offer.\u201d Lord O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist and Tory minister, said last week: \u201cYou do not have to leave the EU to have great trade relationships with new exciting places in the world, and that\u2019s something that the [Brexit] evangelists in the UK seem to ignore.\u201d Using the example of China being Germany\u2019s biggest trading partner, O\u2019Neill said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be good at trade. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re in the EU or not.\u201d O\u2019Neill\u2019s demand for urgent investment in infrastructure, especially to support businesses in the north of the country, fell on deaf ears in the Treasury during his time as commerce secretary and led to his resignation. Any long-term package of cleverly structured subsidies will come too late to save the Bombardier export deal. McFall believes there will be a surge in applications for voluntary redundancies as the legal battle between Bombardier and Boeing rages in the US. \u201cThere has already been a list of guys trying to get out on voluntary redundancies, but I\u2019m sure this case has exacerbated things somewhat,\u201d he says.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair was facing a fresh backlash on Saturday as customers complained they had been told they were ineligible for an improved compensation offer for cancelled flights. Among those affected by more than 20,000 flight cancellations, travellers who had initially opted for a refund on the cost of their Ryanair tickets complained of being, in effect, locked out of the airline\u2019s expanded offer to rebook passengers on other airlines. In what was described by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as a \u201ccapitulation\u201d, Ryanair responded on Friday evening to threats of legal action by emailing affected customers to tell them they could receive a refund or be transferred to other flights, or travel by train, bus or hire car. However, as Ryanair customers digested the announcement, there was anger from those who had already accepted refunds. Travellers told of testy exchanges with customer service staff and having phone calls cut off when they pressed their case. Vasileios Ntontis told the Observer that he had been scheduled to fly from Thessaloniki in Greece to Paris in November: he received an email from Ryanair on Wednesday saying the flight was cancelled, and giving him the option of a refund or rebooking with Ryanair. He accepted a refund and received a voucher the next day. \u201cOn Friday I received a third email saying I could book a flight with another carrier and that Ryanair would cover the cost, but when I contacted them through their chat service they told me that I was not eligible as I had already opted for a refund,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I said that they had not given me that option in the first place, they weren\u2019t very cooperative and tried to avoid any further conversation.\u201d Ntontis said that he had now booked a ticket with Austrian Airlines for \u20ac150 and had been forced to change his holiday dates. Melissa, another passenger, who asked to be identified only by her first name, had booked Ryanair flights to travel with her boyfriend from Scotland to London for her graduation, but her tickets were cancelled. \u201cThey should have paid for my new flights with a rival carrier, but I was not informed of this at the time and only offered a refund or rebooking on one of their flights. I took the refund and booked new flights. I now realise this was not an issue. \u201cI now can\u2019t get hold of anyone to speak to about this. I have lost money on new flights and new transfers to the city centre and back, as I\u2019m now having to fly to a different airport.\u201d A further 18,000 winter flights were cancelled by Ryanair last week in a move that affected 400,000 customers. Several popular routes used by UK travellers were hit, such as Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Gatwick to Belfast, Newcastle to Faro, and Glasgow to Las Palmas. The latest cancellations add to mounting anger at Ryanair, which was already being heavily criticised after cancelling up to 50 flights a day earlier this month. Kenny Jacobs, the airline\u2019s chief marketing officer, said: \u201cWe apologise again sincerely for the disruption and inconvenience our rostering failure has caused some of our customers. \u201cWe have taken on extra customer service staff and are moving now to process and expedite all EU261 claims from affected customers. We are committed to processing all such claims within 21 days of receipt and hope to have all such claims settled before the end of October.\u201d On Thursday, the CAA accused the Dublin-based carrier of \u201cnot complying with the law\u201d over its handling of the fiasco and said it was not telling passengers that under EU261 they were entitled to be rerouted on another airline. Ryanair\u2019s offer to passengers has several conditions, including assessing the cost of flights on other airlines \u201con a case-by-case basis\u201d before bookings are made. Alex Neill, a managing director at consumer group Which?, said passengers face a \u201cpotential minefield\u201d to reach their destination, describing the process as convoluted. \u201cIt still smacks of a lingering reluctance to do the right thing,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has said it made a mistake when it described chicken sold under its Willow Farm brand as \u201creared exclusively\u201d for the supermarket chain, after undercover footage of a processing plant showed packs of drumsticks returned by Lidl being repackaged as Willow Farm products. The UK\u2019s biggest retailer has removed the claim that Willow Farm chicken is \u201creared exclusively for Tesco\u201d from its website after film obtained as part of a Guardian and ITV News investigation into poultry giant 2 Sisters Food Group (2SFG) showed packs of Lidl drumsticks being opened and emptied back on to the production line. The drumsticks then re-emerged at the end of the line, repackaged with Willow Farm labels and destined for Tesco\u2019s shelves. \u201cThe Willow Farm brand is exclusive to Tesco and this is clearly marked on our packaging,\u201d said a Tesco spokesman. \u201cThe wording on our website unfortunately was incorrect and we have already removed it. We sincerely apologise to customers for any confusion this may have caused.\u201d Lawyers from Schillings, speaking on behalf of 2 Sisters, said: \u201cThe Willow Farms brand is exclusive to Tesco, but the raw material is not.\u201d Willow Farm is one of seven so called \u201cfarm\u201d brands launched by Tesco last year to stop customers defecting to cheaper rivals Aldi and Lidl. The use of fake British-sounding farm names, such as Woodside, Willow and Boswell was controversial from the outset with the National Farmers\u2019 Union pointing to the abundance of real farms in Britain. Retailers can return chicken to suppliers for a variety of reasons including packaging and labelling errors. It does not mean it is unfit to eat. However, if older meat is mixed with fresher meat, the use-by date should reflect the age of the oldest meat in the batch. The Guardian investigation found evidence of 2 Sisters workers altering the slaughter date of poultry, raising the risk that shoppers could end up buying meat past its use-by date. It also captured workers dropping chicken on the floor of the processing plant and returning it to the production line. In a statement Schillings, 2 Sisters\u2019s legal advisers, told the Guardian: \u201c2SFG meets the raw materials specifications for the Willow Farms brand.\u201d Tesco said it took the allegations against 2 Sisters extremely seriously and was carrying out its own \u201crigorous\u201d investigation into the issue. \u201cThe Food Standards Agency has conducted an initial inspection which did not find any current breaches, however we will continue to review their findings as well as our own,\u201d continued the spokesman. \u201cTo provide additional assurance to our customers we will also be putting in place further quality measures at the site while our investigation continues.\u201d The Tesco boss, Dave Lewis, a marketer who spent most of his career at consumer brands giant Unilever, has always defended the no-frills farm brands which span meat, poultry and other produce, and have been a big hit with shoppers. Willow Farm chicken drumsticks are the cheapest on sale in Tesco at \u00a31.99 per kilo. Free range, corn-fed drumsticks, sold under its top house brand Finest, cost more than twice as much at \u00a34 a kilo. Last year Lewis insisted that customers were \u201csavvy\u201d about how marketing worked. He added: \u201cDo they come from farms? Yes. Can one farm satisfy all the demand from Tesco? No. The product truth is absolutely right.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Wolf of Wall Street's Jordan Belfort: 'The lessons of the crash have been forgotten'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Wolf of Wall Street forgives but he never forgets. Ten years ago when I last met Jordan Belfort, convicted criminal, aspiring author and shortly to be a man at the center of a fierce bidding war for his biography, I suggested his hair was \u201cthe sort of dark brown that only passes for natural in LA\u201d. Also his skin was a little too taut and maybe he wore lifts. A decade on the 55-year-old still looks 10 years younger than his age. And his hair is still a rich mahogany. But he\u2019s keen to point out it\u2019s all natural. \u201cI swear to God,\u201d he says. \u201cDo I dye my hair?\u201d he asks Anne Koppe, his partner, as they sit in their Manhattan hotel suite. Koppe \u2013 the sort of blonde who probably gets described as \u201cwillowy\u201d and spends part of the interview curled round Belfort like a cat \u2013 points at his chest hair, peaking out from his polo shirt. That\u2019s definitely brown. \u201cIt\u2019s all an expensive dye job,\u201d I say. The couple laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d he says. Back in his native New York for a family visit Belfort seems very happy. It\u2019s over 11 years since he was released from jail having served four years for running a \u201cpump and dump\u201d share selling scheme at his broker, Stratton Oakmont, that prosecutors said led to losses of approximately $200m. Life has moved on for him, and how. His drug-fueled crime spree, in which he crashed a helicopter (while high on quaaludes), sank a yacht and arranged midget-tossing in his office, was turned into a film by Martin Scorsese starring Leonardo DiCaprio, that became an international box office hit. He remains friends with DiCaprio. He taught the actor, who has never done drugs, how to act when he was portraying the scenes of Belfort out of his mind on his usual cocktails of narcotics. It was: \u201cValium for breakfast, marijuana for lunch and quaaludes for dinner,\u201d one of his associates said. Now he has another book out, Way of the Wolf, that promises to teach anyone how to be an ace \u2013 and ethical \u2013 salesman, and is in the early stages of turning his life story into a Broadway musical. Crime does pay! Belfort, 20 years sober, lives a charmed life. It took almost seven years for the film to be made after it was optioned and even that delay worked in his favor. The script originally ended with Belfort in jail. By the time it was made, Belfort had rebuilt his business, giving seminars about his \u201cstraight line\u201d sales techniques and the film ended with him giving one of those talks. It was \u201camazing\u201d he says. \u201cIn a way the fact it was so late really worked.\u201d Now living in Los Angeles, Belfort says he leads a quiet life. \u201cWe are very boring,\u201d he says. \u201cAll these delivery services, Doordash, Grubhub. They make it too easy to stay home and have bed picnics. That\u2019s our favorite thing to do.\u201d But the bizarro world of the Wolf continues. The US government now owns the TV rights to his story (but not the Broadway ones) after the film\u2019s producers, Red Granite Pictures, reached an agreement with federal prosecutors looking to recoup some of the billions they claim were stolen from the Malaysian government and used, in part, to finance the film. Belfort says he had a strange feeling about those investors from the start. \u201cThe way they spent money, I have never seen anything like it,\u201d he says. The Malaysian investors flew Kanye West out for the film\u2019s launch party. When you steal money, he says, you just want to spend it. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weird compulsion,\u201d says a man who should know. For his own part, Belfort says the high-spending days are over. He wants to pay back Stratton\u2019s investors (he\u2019s already paid about $20m) and get on with his life. But his celebrity \u2013 and his past \u2013 do get in the way. All the harping on the past can be a bit annoying. \u201cThe movie came out a few years back but it depicts events from my life almost 30 years ago. I\u2019m not the same Jordan Belfort. I continue to pay back money and I am hopeful that I will pay back all the money. It\u2019s frustrating because you want to reinvent yourself and you feel you have. And he knows your past is always there.\u201d The book, he says smoothly moving into sales pitch mode, is about that. \u201cIt\u2019s really about a strategy for coming back from failure,\u201d he says. \u201cI should have written this book a long time ago,\u201d he says. The problem is he hates writing. Anne shows me a video of him typing away in bed (they clearly spend a lot of time there). He holds the laptop in one hand and types one finger at a time. \u201cEven better,\u201d he says out loud in the video. \u201cBetter yet. Better though.\u201d He pauses. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve been. Once you HAVE been \u2026\u201d It goes on and on and looks excruciating. Anne says it helped him sleep. A lot. But the result is fun, with more insights from the world of Stratton Oakmont and allusions to The Italian Job and Forrest Gump. It\u2019s the sort of easy read that will no doubt fly off the bookshelves at airports around the world. It\u2019s not just for sales people, he says. Everyone is always selling themselves. \u201cThere are so many people out there who are brilliant, hardworking and industrious but lack the art of persuasion,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because of that they end up dying with their music on their lips. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d If he wants to make the switch from villain to hero, there are others to take his place. In the pantheon of Wall Street villains Belfort has been eclipsed by Martin Shkreli, the \u201cpharma bro\u201d who hiked the price of a lifesaving drug 5,000% and is now in jail after calling on his Facebook fans to steal a lock of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair. \u201cThere has got to be something wrong with that guy,\u201d says Belfort. \u201cIs he crazy?\u201d But it\u2019s not the players, it\u2019s the bigger picture on Wall Street that worries him these days. He says bitcoin is a bubble waiting to burst. \u201cIt\u2019s artificially created scarcity,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem I have with bitcoin right now is that it\u2019s very much like at the tail end of of 2007, 2008 right before the mortgage market blew up. You\u2019d be getting your haircut and he\u2019d be like: \u2018Oh yeah I also do mortgages on the side.\u2019 Everybody was a broker. Everyone\u2019s flipping houses. Now everyone\u2019s buying bitcoin. I promise you the end is near.\u201d He also thinks that the stock markets \u2013 which seem to reach record highs on a daily basis \u2013 are in for a fall. \u201cI think the lessons of the crash have been forgotten,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like we are going back into a cycle of irrational exuberance.

      "body": "<p>The Wolf of Wall Street forgives but he never forgets. Ten years ago when I last met Jordan Belfort, convicted criminal, aspiring author and shortly to be a man at the center of a fierce bidding war for his biography, I suggested his hair was \u201cthe sort of dark brown that only passes for natural in LA\u201d. Also his skin was a little too taut and maybe he wore lifts.</p> <p>A decade on the 55-year-old still looks 10 years younger than his age. And his hair is still a rich mahogany. But he\u2019s keen to point out it\u2019s all natural. \u201cI swear to God,\u201d he says. \u201cDo I dye my hair?\u201d he asks Anne Koppe, his partner, as they sit in their Manhattan hotel suite. </p> <p>Koppe \u2013 the sort of blonde who probably gets described as \u201cwillowy\u201d and spends part of the interview curled round Belfort like a cat \u2013 points at his chest hair, peaking out from his polo shirt. That\u2019s definitely brown. \u201cIt\u2019s all an expensive dye job,\u201d I say. The couple laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Back in his native New York for a family visit Belfort seems very happy. It\u2019s over 11 years since he was released from jail having served four years for running a \u201cpump and dump\u201d share selling scheme at his broker, Stratton Oakmont, that prosecutors said led to losses of approximately $200m. Life has moved on for him, and how.</p> <p>His drug-fueled crime spree, in which he crashed a helicopter (while high on quaaludes), sank a yacht and arranged midget-tossing in his office, was turned into a film by Martin Scorsese starring Leonardo DiCaprio, that became an international box office hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81f7b77265b303cb37f0ffdc4e1d004e550612f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81f7b77265b303cb37f0ffdc4e1d004e550612f7/0_193_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort in \u2018The Wolf of Wall Street.\u2019.

Belfort taught DiCaprio how to act like he was on drugs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He remains friends with DiCaprio. He taught the actor, who has never done drugs, how to act when he was portraying the scenes of Belfort out of his mind on his usual cocktails of narcotics. It was: \u201cValium for breakfast, marijuana for lunch and quaaludes for dinner,\u201d one of his <a href=\"http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/7555-former-employee-of-real-wolf-of-wall-street-talks-life-of-excess\">associates said.</a></p> <p>Now he has another book out, <a href=\"http://jordanbelfort.com/way-of-the-wolf/\">Way of the Wolf</a>, that promises to teach anyone how to be an ace \u2013 and ethical \u2013 salesman, and is in the early stages of turning his life story into a Broadway musical. Crime does pay!</p> <p>Belfort, 20 years sober, lives a charmed life. It took almost seven years for the film to be made after it was optioned and even that delay worked in his favor. The script originally ended with Belfort in jail. By the time it was made, Belfort had rebuilt his business, giving seminars about his \u201cstraight line\u201d sales techniques and the film ended with him giving one of those talks. It was \u201camazing\u201d he says. \u201cIn a way the fact it was so late really worked.\u201d</p> <p>Now living in Los Angeles, Belfort says he leads a quiet life. \u201cWe are very boring,\u201d he says. \u201cAll these delivery services, Doordash, Grubhub. They make it too easy to stay home and have bed picnics. That\u2019s our favorite thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>But the bizarro world of the Wolf continues. The US government now owns the TV rights to his story (but not the Broadway ones) after the film\u2019s producers, Red Granite Pictures, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/wolf-of-wall-street-red-granite-1mdb-settlement-1202560617/\">reached an agreement</a> with federal prosecutors looking to recoup some of the billions they claim were stolen from the Malaysian government and used, in part, to finance the film.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iszwuX1AK6A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iszwuX1AK6A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Belfort says he had a strange feeling about those investors from the start. \u201cThe way they spent money, I have never seen anything like it,\u201d he says. The Malaysian investors flew Kanye West out for the film\u2019s launch party. When you steal money, he says, you just want to spend it. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weird compulsion,\u201d says a man who should know.</p> <p>For his own part, Belfort says the high-spending days are over. He wants to pay back Stratton\u2019s investors (he\u2019s already paid about $20m) and get on with his life. But his celebrity \u2013 and his past \u2013 do get in the way.</p> <p>All the harping on the past can be a bit annoying. \u201cThe movie came out a few years back but it depicts events from my life almost 30 years ago. I\u2019m not the same Jordan Belfort. I continue to pay back money and I am hopeful that I will pay back all the money. It\u2019s frustrating because you want to reinvent yourself and you feel you have. And he knows your past is always there.\u201d</p> <p>The book, he says smoothly moving into sales pitch mode, is about that. \u201cIt\u2019s really about a strategy for coming back from failure,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>\u201cI should have written this book a long time ago,\u201d he says. The problem is he hates writing. </p> <p>Anne shows me a video of him typing away in bed (they clearly spend a lot of time there). He holds the laptop in one hand and types one finger at a time. \u201cEven better,\u201d he says out loud in the video. \u201cBetter yet. Better though.\u201d He pauses. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve been. Once you HAVE been \u2026\u201d It goes on and on and looks excruciating. Anne says it helped him sleep. A lot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"006f944ebe2ae2300cd69d24908d76d66ecc600d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/006f944ebe2ae2300cd69d24908d76d66ecc600d/0_191_3536_2122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan Belfort hosts business conference in Mexico City in May 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan Belfort hosts business conference in Mexico City in May 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: El Universal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the result is fun, with more insights from the world of Stratton Oakmont and allusions to The Italian Job and Forrest Gump. It\u2019s the sort of easy read that will no doubt fly off the bookshelves at airports around the world. It\u2019s not just for sales people, he says. Everyone is always selling themselves. \u201cThere are so many people out there who are brilliant, hardworking and industrious but lack the art of persuasion,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because of that they end up dying with their music on their lips. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p> <p>If he wants to make the switch from villain to hero, there are others to take his place. In the pantheon of Wall Street villains Belfort has been eclipsed by Martin Shkreli, the \u201cpharma bro\u201d who hiked the price of a lifesaving drug 5,000% and is now in jail after calling on his Facebook fans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/13/martin-shkreli-jail-securities-fraud-hillary-clinton\">steal a lock of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair</a>. \u201cThere has got to be something wrong with that guy,\u201d says Belfort. \u201cIs he crazy?\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s not the players, it\u2019s the bigger picture on Wall Street that worries him these days. He says bitcoin is a bubble waiting to burst. \u201cIt\u2019s artificially created scarcity,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem I have with bitcoin right now is that it\u2019s very much like at the tail end of of 2007, 2008 right before the mortgage market blew up. You\u2019d be getting your haircut and he\u2019d be like: \u2018Oh yeah I also do mortgages on the side.\u2019 Everybody was a broker. Everyone\u2019s flipping houses. Now everyone\u2019s buying bitcoin. I promise you the end is near.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He also thinks that the stock markets \u2013 which seem to reach record highs on a daily basis \u2013 are in for a fall. \u201cI think the lessons of the crash have been forgotten,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like we are going back into a cycle of irrational exuberance. Like with Trump. How can the country be that unsure of him, how can we be that unsure of him and the markets be so high? If there is that much uncertainty then there is risk,\u201d he says. \u201cThe market itself might not be linked to reality any more,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018greater fool theory\u2019. If there is a greater fool that will buy it from me at a greater price then I did good.\u201d</p> <p>Something is off and there is going to be a big correction, he says. \u201cThere is North Korea and yet \u2026 What are they going to do with the national debt? Something is going to happen.\u201d Whatever it is, you get the feeling it\u2019s going to work out just fine for the Wolf of Wall Street. </p> <p>\u2022 <em>Way of the Wolf is out now through North Star Way in the US and released in Australia by Hachette on 10 October</em></p>",
