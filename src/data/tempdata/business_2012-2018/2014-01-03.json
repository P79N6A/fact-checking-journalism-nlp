      "bodyText": "A power company is offering \u00a375 to any of its customers left without electricity at any time on Christmas Day as part of its compensation package to those affected by blackouts during the storms just before the holiday. More than 130,000 customers in southern England lost power as winds of up to 80mph, along with heavy rain and flooding, hit supplies on 23 December and Christmas Eve. Scottish and Southern Energy said over 500 staff had dealt with more than 850 separate faults, many of which were initially inaccessible due to the conditions. Most who lost power early on Christmas Eve had their power restored on Christmas Day and the final customers by 28 December. Those without electricity for 48 hours were entitled to a payment of \u00a354 and further payments of \u00a354 for each subsequent full 12-hour period, said the company, which covers an area between Somerset and west London in one direction and Oxfordshire and the Isle of Wight in another. It would extend \"goodwill\" payments to anyone without power on 25 December, it said. Mark Mathieson, managing director of networks, said: \"We run an efficient network and I am proud of what we deliver. Just as the Environment Agency cannot make flood defences bulletproof, we cannot wave a magic wand when major weather events hit. \"The levels exceed statutory levels because we recognise what an important time of year it is. We are matching the highest payments in the UK because we don't support postcode lotteries, but we are proud of what we delivered for our customers.\" UK Power Networks, supplying customers in London, south-eastern and eastern England, has already said it is writing to all those eligible for compensation because of power cuts. It said it would boost the industry standard payment from \u00a327 to \u00a375 for customers without power for 48-60 hours including Christmas Day, and additional payments would be made to any customers off supply for longer.",

The city has already produced some globally recognised tech startup successes, including the music sharing service SoundCloud and games company Wooga \u2013 and Wowereit wants more. \"Berlin has caught the public's attention as a startup hub,\" he said. \"We want to capture that momentum and drive Berlin's economy forward. [We] will fully dedicate ourselves to becoming Europe's leading startup hub.\" The city already boasts 2,500 tech startups, and has attracted hundreds of millions of euros in investment from some of the world's biggest venture capital funds. Wowereit admits that Berlin has some way to go in overtaking London as Europe's startup capital and has called in Chancellor Angela Merkel to help. She toured the city's new-tech clusters last year, told startups they were \"the yeast that makes the industry grow\" and promised to help make it easier for foreigners to register to work in the city. The momentum behind Berlin has been building steadily in the past few months with Microsoft founder Bill Gates leading a $35m (\u00a321m) investment in ResearchGate, a Berlin-based global network for scientists. Other big investments include famous Silicon Valley fund Sequoia Capital pumping $19m into 6Wunderkinder, maker of the popular to-do list app Wunderlist.As part of the investment Sequoia's Welsh partner Sir Michael Moritz will join the board of the three-year-old company that already boasts 6m users. New York fund Union Square Ventures led a $7m investment in the Football App, a mobile football news and information service downloaded by more than 12m people. Gates's successor at Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, has opened an \"accelerator\" for startups in a grand building on Unter den Linden, Berlin's most famous boulevard.It joins a long list of other big established companies, including Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Post, drugs company Bayer, media company Alex Springer and even supermarket chain Rewe and Coca-Cola. Ballmer said he chose to locate the accelerator in Berlin \u2013 alongside Bangalore, Paris, Beijing, Tel Aviv and London \u2013 because he had been impressed by the \"amazing emerging ecosystems\" and \"incredible startups\" springing up in the city. Microsoft's general manager for Germany, Christian Illek, said: \"Why have we chosen Berlin? Berlin is the metropolis for creativity. Berlin has become the hotspot in Europe, alongside London, for founding IT companies and startups. \"There is no other city like Berlin where the spirit of pioneering and innovation is so strong. If we succeed in implementing the ideas of startups into successful business models, Berlin will become Europe's Silicon Valley.\" Alexander Ljung, co-founder and chief executive of SoundCloud \u2013 which has attracted investment from Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher's A-Grade Fund and a rumoured $50m from venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers \u2013 said he and co-founder Eric Wahlforss chose to move from their native Sweden to Berlin because of the city's internationally-acclaimed clubbing scene and because it was much cheaper than staying in Stockholm or moving to London. \"The atmosphere and culture in Berlin is very unique,\" he said. \"Since the costs for living are still low, people can afford to only work a few hours per week, and do the stuff they want the rest of the time. \"Some folks are like professional clubgoers. And the consequence is that people in the creative, media and internet world are much more understanding and tolerant when someone comes to a meeting a little bit later, and with a hangover. Nevertheless, if you want to create a company, you have to work hard, which means that you need a lot of discipline here not to get tempted too often to enjoy the Berlin nightlife.\" Rising rents in London's Silicon Roundabout are also pricing out many startups, with some looking as far afield as Berlin. According to the estate agent Savills startups have made the area around Old Street roundabout so \"fun, funky and trendy\" that \"boring corporates think: 'we want a bit of that'\" and are sending the rents up to \u00a340 per sq ft, and a single desk space in a shared office to \u00a3400 a month. By comparison, Berlin office rents can range from as low as \u20ac4 per sq ft in the trendy up-and-coming Neuk\u00f6lln district to \u20ac20 in Mitte, right in the centre. Google is backing The Factory, a new 16,000 sq ft startup campus complete with apartments, gym and restaurants built into the remains of the Berlin Wall near the touristy Mauerpark flea market. Office space in the building costs \u20ac16 per sq ft and was fully let months before opening. Simon Schaefer, founder of The Factory, said people from the UK, Europe and the rest of the world were attracted by the rents but also the opportunity to help build a community. \"There is nothing that Berlin really stands for, except being cheap and cool, and drunk and druggie,\" he said. \"It's the potential to shape something, that is why so many people are coming here.\" Adam Haywood, the British chief executive of the photography location service Reccy, said his company chose to start in Berlin rather than London because \"the rents and other costs are so much lower we can stretch money a lot further. It's also a really fun city and everyone speaks English\". Berlin's internationalism and the widespread use of English is another key draw for startups and investors. Jens Begemann, founder and chief executive of Wooga and a mentor to dozens of other startups, says the office language of all startups in the city is English even in the few that have all German-speaking staff. \"You have to have everything in English, it is the only language we speak here,\" he said in Wooga's colourful offices near Alexanderplatz. \"Because English is the official language here we can hire anyone from anywhere. There are talented young people across the world who can't get jobs; if they come here they can get a job. \"We have done interviews over Skype, and they've arrived the next day.\" He jokes that the company canteen \u2013 which apes Google by giving away food and drink \u2013 is \"like the United Nations\" because the company employs staff from about 50 countries. Foreign staff are not required to learn English, but they are offered lessons and encouraged \"to try\". The influx of young well-paid non-German speaking people has not gone down well with everyone, mainly because it has pushed up rents for locals. Monika Herrmann, the mayor of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, one of the areas most favoured by expats, has accused long-term visitors of treating the city as a \"movie set\". \"I expect them to participate. It's not just a cool place to live. It's not just a place to party. The coolness of the district has something to do with the fact that we want to live here together,\" she told the English-language magazine Ex-Berliner. \"It has something to do with the fact that you meet in your pub at night, regardless of which language you speak. There's a danger that this will slowly disappear, because some people just want to invest in a cool area, which they don't really care about.\"",

The idea was that a fall in the unemployment rate to 7% would trigger a rate rise (the jobless rate is 7.4% according to the latest ONS data). The MPC has since suggested it could lower the trigger threshold to 6.5%, which appears increasingly likely according to <strong>Scotiabank's</strong> <strong>Alan Clarke</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The unemployment rate fell by much more than expected in October [to 7.4% from 7.6%], bringing forward the likely timing that the magic 7% threshold will be hit. We think that 7% will be hit in the early months of 2014. As a result, the BoE is likely to modify its forward guidance policy \u2013 lowering the threshold to 6.5% - most likely at the February Inflation Report.</p> <p>Despite moving the target, <strong>the timing of the first rate hike does feel like it is moving closer</strong>. While we wouldn\u2019t rule out an interest rate hike this year, early 2015 seems more likely at this stage.</p> </blockquote> <p>So while no imminent move on rates is expected, the debate is likely to build as 2014 gets underway, especially if the data continue to paint a positive picture.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Sentance, PwC economist and a former MPC member</strong>, has told his Twitter followers that a lowering of the forward guildance threshold to 6.5% unemployment would be a mistake:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/asentance/statuses/419116000303280129\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky\">@EdConwaySky</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland\">@bankofengland</a> If they do, it will be part of a consistent pattern - waiting till it is too late before raising rates.</p>&mdash; Andrew Sentance (@asentance) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asentance/statuses/419116000303280129\">January 3, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-03T14:50:38.373Z\">at 2.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52c6b54ee4b09f9df01d21ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-03T13:32:33.178Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek bank deposits rose in November, ending a five-month decline</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-85f9608b-cfea-414a-9a85-50cd0fb21529\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2010/4/28/1272458333161/Bank-of-Greece-HQGreek-de-004.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of Greece HQ\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of Greece HQ</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Greek bank deposits</strong> rose slightly in November according to the <strong>Bank of Greece</strong>, following five months of declines during as consumers struggled to deal with austerity and a crisis ridden economy.Business and household deposits rose to \u20ac161.04bn from \u20ac160.38bn in October.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the central bank said <a href=\"http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/PressReleases/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=4463&amp;List_ID=1af869f3-57fb-4de6-b9ae-bdfd83c66c95&amp;Filter_by=DT\">lending to the private sector</a>&#xa0;fell by 3.8% in November compared with a year earlier (following a 3.9% fall in October).

      "bodyText": "That's all for today. The major indices in the US and Europe remain in positive territory. The FTSE 100 is up 0.4% with Next still heading the leader board, up 10.2% after that strong trading update. Economists await the December UK services PMI from Markit/CIPS on Monday, which follows today's upbeat survey from the construction sector. Staying in the UK Nationwide said average house prices rose 8.4% in 2013, while the Bank of England reported a rise in mortgage approvals in November. UK lending to businesses fell, however, while inflation in Italy and Spain remained subdued. Thank you for reading and commenting today, and please join us again on Monday. Have a great weekend. AM The biggest risk to the UK's economic recovery would be a continued dependence on debt fuelled spending and rising house prices, and insufficient growth in business investment and exports according to economists polled by Reuters. After all, the strong data we've seen from the housing sector today does little to help the government's ambitions of a rebalanced economy. Dow Jones: +0.15% at 16,466.78 S&amp;P 500: +0.12% at 1,834.10 Nasdaq: +0.14% at 4,148.83 Precious metal prices have climbed on rising demand for safe haven assets. Spot gold rose to a two-week high of $1,231.6 an ounce after its first annual fall in 32 years in 2013. Platinum touched a six-week high, while palladium hit a three week high. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said another drop in the price of gold was possible in 2014. \"It's probably too early to say that we've seen the lows,\" he told Reuters. Back in the UK, we have the first monthly policy decision of 2014 from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee on Thursday next week. Economists are not expecting a move on interest rates, which have been held at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009, but speculation about the timing of a first rate hike is mounting. The economy appears to be growing steadily, unemployment is falling, and yet monetary policy remains exceptionally loose, thanks to a combination of historically low rates and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing. Mark Carney broke with tradition when he joined the Bank as governor last summer, by introducing forward guidance to give some indication of the likely future path of interest rates. The idea was that a fall in the unemployment rate to 7% would trigger a rate rise (the jobless rate is 7.4% according to the latest ONS data). The MPC has since suggested it could lower the trigger threshold to 6.5%, which appears increasingly likely according to Scotiabank's Alan Clarke: The unemployment rate fell by much more than expected in October [to 7.4% from 7.6%], bringing forward the likely timing that the magic 7% threshold will be hit. We think that 7% will be hit in the early months of 2014. As a result, the BoE is likely to modify its forward guidance policy \u2013 lowering the threshold to 6.5% - most likely at the February Inflation Report. Despite moving the target, the timing of the first rate hike does feel like it is moving closer. While we wouldn\u2019t rule out an interest rate hike this year, early 2015 seems more likely at this stage. So while no imminent move on rates is expected, the debate is likely to build as 2014 gets underway, especially if the data continue to paint a positive picture. Andrew Sentance, PwC economist and a former MPC member, has told his Twitter followers that a lowering of the forward guildance threshold to 6.5% unemployment would be a mistake: Greek bank deposits rose slightly in November according to the Bank of Greece, following five months of declines during as consumers struggled to deal with austerity and a crisis ridden economy.Business and household deposits rose to \u20ac161.04bn from \u20ac160.38bn in October. Meanwhile, the central bank said lending to the private sector fell by 3.8% in November compared with a year earlier (following a 3.9% fall in October). Falling deposits and tougher capital requirements have held back bank lending in the cash-strapped country since mid 2011. A weak pricing environment persisted in Italy and Spain in December according to the latest official data, as high unemployment and declining incomes weigh on consumer spending. Annual inflation in Italy slowed to 0.6% from 0.7% in November, while in Spain inflation remained flat at 0.3%. Last month the European Central Bank lowered its forecast for eurozone inflation in 2014 and 2015 to 1.1% and 1.3% respectively, undershooting the bank's target of 2% inflation. Mario Draghi, ECB president, said the central bank was \"fully aware of downside risks of protracted low inflation\", but insisted the eurozone was unlikely to sink into a Japan-style deflationary spiral and Lost Decade. Some brighter corporate news, not least from the UK's retail sector, has encouraged modestly positive sentiment among European investors: FTSE 100: +0.06% at 6,722.16 CAC 40: +0.47% at 4,246.98 DAX 30: +0.23% at 9,421.21 IBEX: +0.43% at 9,802.9 FTSE MIB: +0.94% at 19,107.43 While consumer credit rose in Novemer lending to businesses dropped sharply by \u00a34.7bn in the same month. It was the sharpest drop since the Bank of England series started in April 2011, and a bigger drop than the \u00a31.1bn fall in October. However, the fall was entirely down to diminishing large business loans, while lending to small and medium-sized enterprises actually nudged up by \u00a3140m, following a decline of \u00a3505m and \u00a3383m in October and September respectively. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics: Looking ahead, only a gradual recovery in bank lending continues to look likely. While new buyer enquires at estate agents have reportedly continued to rise, anecdotal evidence suggests that many applicants are still failing banks\u2019 strict affordability tests. What\u2019s more, mortgage rates could rise soon in response to recent increase in market interest rates and the Bank of England\u2019s decision at the end of November to remove the incentives that the Funding for Lending Scheme provides to expand mortgage lending. Meanwhile, firms\u2019 large cash stockpiles may mean that their appetite for external funds remains depressed. So all in all, lending seems unlikely to pick up in 2014 to levels that would come close to resembling another credit boom. UK mortgage approvals for house purchase (i.e excluding remortgages) rose to 70,758 in November from 68,029 a month earlier. It was the highest level since January 2008, before the financial crisis took hold. The Bank of England data showed lending to houses increased. Unsecured consumer credit rose to \u00a3627m in November from a four-month low of \u00a3452m in October. Meanwhile as Christmas drew near net borrowing on credit cards rose to \u00a3388m from \u00a3266m in October and a five-month low of \u00a3166m in September. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight: Overall, it does appear that markedly improved consumer confidence overall means that people have become more prepared to borrow in recent months. It may also be that the squeeze on consumer spending coming from inflation running well above earnings growth for an extended period means that some people are having to borrow more to finance any major spending. There is concern that improved UK growth is being fuelled by consumers increasing their debt. However, while unsecured consumer borrowing has undeniably picked up overall in recent months, it is currently still relatively limited compared to long-term norms and appreciably below the levels seen before the 2008/9 crisis. Growth in activity in Britain's construction sector edged slightly lower in December from a six year high in November. The Markit/CIPS construction PMI fell to 62.1 from 62.6 a month earlier. However, with anything above 50 indicating expansion, the sector was still seeing robust growth, and the December figure was slightly better than economists were expecting. The latest survey marked the eighth successive month of expansion for the UK construction sector. There was broad based growth across the construction industry, but the fastest pace of growth was in housebuilding, at 63.7 on the index. Work on commercial projects rost the most since August 2007, while civil engineering activity was flat. Employment in the industry grew for a seventh month. Read the full story on the construction PMI by the Guardian's Katie Allen here. Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist said the latest survey suggested the economy as whole was grew at a faster rate in the fourth quarter of 2013 than the 0.8% growth achieved in the third quarter. The construction industry enjoyed another month of strong growth in December, according to PMI survey respondents. The sector consequently looks to have provided a major boost to the UK economy in the final quarter of 2013, with output and jobs growing at some of the fastest rates for just over six years. The upturn is also broad-based within the construction sector, as levels of housing, commercial and civil engineering activity all rising sharply. The slowing in the construction sector matched a similar easing in the manufacturing PMI survey in December, though both surveys remained at elevated levels and were consistent with the economy as a whole picking up further momentum from the 0.8% quarterly pace of growth seen in the third quarter. As we await the UK construction PMI, the official purchasing managers' index for China's services sector dropped to a four-month low of 54.6 in December, from 56 in November. The government survey showed that business expectations fell, building on evidence that the world's second largest economy lost some momentum as 2013 drew to a close The FTSE 100 turns 30 today, having replaced the FT30 as the main indicator for companies listed on the London Stock Exchange on 3 January 1984. Just 30 companies from the original list are featured in the index today and only 19 have remained for the entire period - including oil giant BP, retailer Marks &amp; Spencer and insurer Prudential. The Press Association reports: Britain's leading share index marks its 30th anniversary on Friday as forecasts suggest that it will reach record highs in the year ahead. The FTSE 100 replaced the FT 30 as the main indicator for the performance of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange on 3 January 1984. Today, the combined value of its constituents stands at \u00a31.87tn, more than 10 times higher than the market capitalisation total of \u00a3164bn in December 1985, the first available data. The index has weathered the miners' strike, the Big Bang of market deregulation in 1986 and the Black Monday crash of 1987, as well as the dotcom boom in the 1990s and most recently the financial crisis. The FTSE 100 was founded with a base level of 1000. It reached an all-time closing high of 6930.2 at the height of the dotcom boom on 30 December 1999. Its biggest one-day rise, 9.8%, came on 24 November 2008 as the index bounced back from a five-year low during the financial crisis. The steepest fall came on 20 October 1987, when it plunged 12.2% following a wave of panic selling on Wall Street that became known as Black Monday. On an annual basis, the biggest rise was in 1997, when it rose nearly 25%, and the heaviest fall was in 2008, when it fell 31%. It reached its lowest level of the last five years on 5 March 2009, sliding to 3529.7 as the Bank of England slashed interest rates to their current low and started pumping billions into the economy amid the dark days of recession. By the end of the year, however, it had jumped 22% as the stimulus measures began to take effect. The picture across Europe is a bit mixed this morning, following falls in US stock markets on Thursday and a 0.7% rise in the Nikkei overnight. Shares in Next are now up by more than 10% after that strong trading update but the FTSE 100 is down 0.2% at 6,705.03. CAC 40: +0.15% at 4,233.6+8 DAX 30: -0.21% at 9,380.50 IBEX: -0.06 at 9,754.1 FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 18,985.94 Meanwhile momentum in the UK housing market continues to build, with Nationwide reporting an 8.4% rise in average house prices in 2013, ending the year at \u00a3175,826. On a monthly basis, prices rose 1.4% in December, which was the biggest monthly increase in more than four years. House price growth has been outstripping average earnings growth since the middle of 2013. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, had this to say: The UK housing market followed the trajectory of the wider economy through 2013, gaining momentum as the year progressed. Overall, prices increased by 8.4% in 2013, though they remain around 5% below the all-time highs recorded in late 2007. A large part of the pickup in the housing market can be attributed to further improvements in the labour market and the brighter economic outlook, which helped to bolster sentiment amongst potential buyers. Policy measures also played an important supporting role by helping to keep mortgage rates close to all-time lows and improving the availability of credit, especially for those with smaller deposits. A breakdown of the figures showed that on a regional basis, Manchester beat London as the biggest riser, with average property values in the City up 21% over the year. London came in second followed by Brighton in third place. Best performing towns/cities: Manchester: +21% at \u00a3209,627 London: +13% at \u00a3385,741 Brighton: +12% at \u00a3348,918 Leicester: +11% at \u00a3168,778 Birmingham: +10% at \u00a3151,793 Worst performing towns/cities: Carlisle: +1% at \u00a3136,128 Edinburgh: +1% at \u00a3235,907 Newcastle: +2% at \u00a3169,395 Glasgow: +2% at \u00a3157,364 Coventry: +2% at \u00a3170,243 UK house prices rose 2.7% to \u00a3174,444 in the fourth quarter, 7.1% higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Read our full story here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone, and the business world. We've had more upbeat news from the UK this morning as clothing retailer Next upped its pre-tax profit guidance for the year to 25 January to between \u00a3684m to \u00a3700m. Back in October it was expecting pre-tax profits of between \u00a3650m and \u00a3680m, which was also an upward revision from an earlier estimate. Next shares are toppping the FTSE 100 leader board, up 8% at \u00a359.60. \"We are now confident of achieving an annual profit of around \u00a3692m in the current year, the midpoint of our guidance range,\" the company says in a trading update. Next has also decided to pay a special dividend of 50p a share to shareholders, to be paid on 3 February, and at a cost of \u00a375m. The retailer has put its strong Christmas performance down to a better range of \"seasonal knitwear, nightwear and gift offer.\" Sales were up 12% on last year for the period from 1 November to 24 December. That said, it wouldn't be a Next update without a heavy dose of caution to counter the optimists: It is very unlikely that the strength shown in this quarter will continue through the first half of the new financial year, and of course this year's success will present difficult comparative numbers in the fourth quarter next year. As far as the consumer environment is concerned, it seems likely that the economy will continue to steadily improve with strong employment numbers driving a general recovery. However, the problem of little or no growth in real earnings looks set to persist for some time, and we cannot see any reason to expect a significant increase in total consumer spending in the year ahead. We are also wary that any return to significant economic growth is likely to result in rising interest rates which, in turn, is likely to moderate spending of those with mortgages. At 9.30 we get December's construction PMI from Markit/CIPS which will reveal whether or not the building industry ended 2013 on a high note in a similar fashion to the manufacturing sector.",

Just 12 months ago, the shares were changing hands at \u00a339.05. The group shrugged off fears that the festive season had been tough for clothing stores with a 12% rise in sales in the period from 1 November to 24 December compared with the same period a year before. Next held out against a wave of discounting by rivals in the final trading days before Christmas, but doubled its pace of growth online from the previous quarter and experienced its strongest underlying growth in stores since the summer of 2002, according to analysts at Bernstein. In light of that storming performance, Next raised its pre-tax profit forecast for 2013 by about 4% to a range of \u00a3684m to \u00a3700m, putting it well ahead of the City's expectations for the much bigger Marks &amp; Spencer, which is expected to make an annual profit of \u00a3650m. Next's stock market value climbed to nearly \u00a32bn more than Marks &amp; Spencer as it announced that a special dividend of 50p a share would be paid to shareholders in early February, at a cost of \u00a375m. The company is planning to distribute a further \u00a3300m in 2014 via share buybacks and special dividends. Next's healthy Christmas numbers come after John Lewis and House of Fraser reported a seasonal sales surge, boosted by performance online. Out in the cold is Debenhams, which issued a profits warning and parted company with its finance director after disappointing sales. Attention is now turning to Marks &amp; Spencer. Like Debenhams, the group slashed prices in a last-minute attempt to woo shoppers in the days leading up to Christmas, raising fears that the high-street stalwart could also miss its profit targets. A poor Christmas for Marks &amp; Spencer, which reveals its festive trading figures next week, would pile more pressure on the chief executive, Marc Bolland, who is trying to turn around years of poor clothing sales. Analysts said that Next's strict policy of not discounting until the clearly defined start of its sale on Boxing Day was something other retailers should take heed of and had clearly not affected its ability to take market share. Neil Saunders, at the retail analysts Conlumino, said: \"This is one of the reasons why Next is a festive winner in terms of both sales and profits.\" Simon Wolfson, the chief executive, said Next had performed well partly because of shoppers' growing confidence in ordering online for delivery to homes and stores, which helped the company capitalise on a late surge in sales this year. But he said sales had mainly been lifted because Next had got its ranges right this year, particularly on womenswear, after a not so sparkling year in 2012. \"We had a good season and a lot of ranges were better than the previous year.\" Lord Wolfson warned that the retailer's strong performance was unlikely to continue in the first half of 2014 and sounded a warning about confidence among cash-strapped consumers. \"The consumer hasn't had an awful lot more to spend. Looking forward, the environment will be better, just not a lot better,\" he said. \"Although we have seen a return to economic growth and the credit squeeze on consumers is abating, earnings are not keeping up with inflation and so we are not expecting a return to the boom times.\" On a day when Nationwide revealed that house prices rose by 8.4% in 2013, Next sounded the alarm over a potential rise in interest rates adding further pressure on household incomes. \"We are also wary that any return to significant economic growth is likely to result in rising interest rates which, in turn, is likely to moderate spending of those with mortgages,\" the company said. The City took heart from Next's performance as it awaits a flurry of Christmas trading reports over the coming weeks. The supermarkets Tesco and Sainsbury's and the online grocer Ocado are scheduled to reveal trading figures next week.

      "bodyText": "The amount lent to businesses has suffered its biggest drop since April 2011, raising concerns that economic growth is dependent on household spending, and casting doubt on the effectiveness of schemes intended to increase banks' appetite to lend. Lending to non-financial companies fell by \u00a34.7bn in November, compared with a monthly average decrease of \u00a31bn over the previous six months. But it was caused by a drop in loans to big businesses and the data, from the Bank of England, showed that small business lending actually rose for the first time in five months. \"Whatever the causes behind the marked drop in business lending in November, the data suggests that banks have yet to become markedly more prepared to lend to businesses amid the improved economic situation and outlook,\" said Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight. The Funding for Lending scheme (FLS) was refocused on business lending in November in an attempt by the Bank of England to take some of the heat out of the mortgage market, where lending is recovering from the 2008 banking crisis. In November, 70,758 mortgages were approved, up from 68,029 the previous month and the most since January 2008, although lending, at \u00a316bn in November, is still half of that before the crisis. While the FLS is being refocused from the mortgage market, the government's Help to Buy scheme \u2013 which helps customers with only small deposits for their homes \u2013 is continuing \u2013 David Cameron on Thursday insisted the policy was not feeding a housing bubble. The prime minister said that the house price growth was focused in London and south-east, although the latest house price survey from Nationwide building society showed that Manchester beat the capital to have the strongest house price growth in 2013. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the Help to bBuy mortgage guarantee scheme could be fuelling the mortgage approval figures and that the data followed by the Bank of England's monetary policy committee was not growing. \"The MPC's preferred measure of overall bank lending merely held steady in November. While lending to households increased a fraction, lending to companies fell by 0.5% on the previous month,\" Tombs said. David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas, said Help to Buy and the FLS had been successful in stimulating the housing market and were also helping to fuel the construction industry, reflected in data released on Friday that showed construction growing for the eighth consecutive month. \"A recovery in residential housebuilding is a key driver in the rise in the PMI, with the index having risen from 47.5 in January 2013 to stand at 63.7 in December. But that is not the only story. Civil engineering has also seen a solid rise, and work on commercial construction in December showed the latest rise since August 2007,\" said Tinsley. \"Overall the picture from the data remains consistent with a UK recovery that has been fairly household-led. The housing market is recovery strongly and this has seen some useful rise in construction activity too. And this construction uptick is spreading beyond just housing, which is encouraging. But for now there remains relatively little sign of a pick-up in broader corporate lending.\" Households borrowed an extra \u00a31.5bn in November - the small increase since June 2012 - while credit card borrowing rose slightly to \u00a357.4bn, its highest level since May 2011.",

A survey of the sector suggested it was continuing to claw back ground lost during the downturn and finished 2013 with its eighth straight month of growth. The Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI came in slightly ahead of expectations with a headline activity reading of 62.1 for December. That was well above the 50-mark which separates growth from contraction but was down from 62.6 in November, which is the highest reading since mid-2007. Construction companies said greater confidence in the economic outlook meant clients were spending more. The survey indicated the biggest growth in commercial projects since 2007, before the financial crisis. Housebuilding remained the fastest growing area of the sector, echoing a pick-up in housing market activity and the government scheme to boost access to mortgages, the Help to Buy initiative. Separate data from the Bank of England on Friday showed mortgage approvals hit a new five-year high in November.

MPs have expressed \"extreme concern\" that drug manufacturers appear to only publish around 50% of completed trial results and warned that the practice has \"ramifications for the whole of medicine\". Their conclusions have emerged in a public accounts committee report which examined the Department of Health's decision to spend \u00a3424m on stockpiling the flu drug Tamiflu, before writing off \u00a374m because of poor record keeping. The MPs found that experts failed to agree on how well Tamiflu works, but discussions were hampered because important information was held back. Richard Bacon, a senior member of the committee, said the practice of holding back results was undermining the ability of doctors, researchers and patients to make informed decisions about treatments. \"Regulators and the industry have made proposals to open up access, but these do not cover the issue of access to the results of trials in the past which bear on the efficacy and safety of medicines in use today,\" he said. \"Research suggests that the probability of completed trials being published is roughly 50%.
