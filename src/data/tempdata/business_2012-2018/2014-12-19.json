Those knitwear discounts were on top of a widely advertised 30% discount on adult coats. and speculation that the store chain has seen a decline in the number of shoppers in its stores while its online sales are suffering because of problems at the company\u2019s new high-tech warehouse.</p> <p>Gap, often one of the first chains to go for sales, is offering up to 60% off a vast range of clothing with a further 20% reduction on some items. In its Oxford Circus store in London, H&amp;M had a whole floor of sale items on offer at up to 60% off. Debenhams, Benetton, Miss Selfridge, BHS, Moss Bros, French Connection, Mango and House of Fraser are all offering up to 50%.</p> <p>Some chains, including Hobbs and French Connection appeared to have about half their stock in the sale, while discounts at Primark and River Island are very limited. Only a few retailers \u2013 notably Ted Baker, Next and Mint Velvet \u2013 are holding their nerve and sticking to their full prices.</p> <p>John Lewis, which analysts said was one of the busiest stores on the high street, is only discounting branded items where it is forced to match prices against other retailers as part of its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d price promise.</p> <p>Analysts said the big discounts did not necessarily mean slumping profits. They believe most retailers have limited the damage to their bottom line by being more cautious about the amount of stock ordered this year, so less stock has to be marked down and the sales after Christmas could end early.</p> <p>Veteran retail analyst Tony Shiret at BESI said: \u201cIts difficult but not desperate. The big guys have been more disciplined than last year.\u201d</p> <p>Alastair Davies, a retail expert at broker Investec agreed that retailers appeared to have planned more carefully but he said it was too early to tell how their profits might be affected. \u201cIts a nailbiting finish for the clothing sector this year and the sector has a habit of shooting itself in the foot.\u201d</p>",

Mark Hudson, a retail expert at accountancy company PwC said its weekly survey of the top 100 high street retailers found 75% are on sale this week, up from 72% last year, with average discounts of 45% \u2013 the same level as last year. However, Hudson, said there are more cuts to come: \u201cExpect to see further sale activity in the final three days as savvy last-minute shoppers hold out for pre-Christmas bargains.\u201d On Oxford Street, in London\u2019s West End, on Friday , piles of unsold knitwear and coats were on offer at knock-down prices in nearly every store. Marks &amp; Spencer is offering 30% off almost all its knitwear, the chain\u2019s most important winter product category, in an apparent panic move as the sale was not backed up by any advertising or online deals. Those knitwear discounts were on top of a widely advertised 30% discount on adult coats. and speculation that the store chain has seen a decline in the number of shoppers in its stores while its online sales are suffering because of problems at the company\u2019s new high-tech warehouse. Gap, often one of the first chains to go for sales, is offering up to 60% off a vast range of clothing with a further 20% reduction on some items. In its Oxford Circus store in London, H&amp;M had a whole floor of sale items on offer at up to 60% off. Debenhams, Benetton, Miss Selfridge, BHS, Moss Bros, French Connection, Mango and House of Fraser are all offering up to 50%. Some chains, including Hobbs and French Connection appeared to have about half their stock in the sale, while discounts at Primark and River Island are very limited. Only a few retailers \u2013 notably Ted Baker, Next and Mint Velvet \u2013 are holding their nerve and sticking to their full prices. John Lewis, which analysts said was one of the busiest stores on the high street, is only discounting branded items where it is forced to match prices against other retailers as part of its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d price promise. Analysts said the big discounts did not necessarily mean slumping profits. They believe most retailers have limited the damage to their bottom line by being more cautious about the amount of stock ordered this year, so less stock has to be marked down and the sales after Christmas could end early. Veteran retail analyst Tony Shiret at BESI said: \u201cIts difficult but not desperate. The big guys have been more disciplined than last year.\u201d Alastair Davies, a retail expert at broker Investec agreed that retailers appeared to have planned more carefully but he said it was too early to tell how their profits might be affected. \u201cIts a nailbiting finish for the clothing sector this year and the sector has a habit of shooting itself in the foot.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Another rally across global markets looked on the cards early on, following the US Federal Reserve\u2019s comments it would be patient over any rate rise and upbeat statements from Japan\u2019s central bank about the country\u2019s economic prospects. The rouble was recovering and oil was fairly steady. But while the UK held onto its gains, European markets slipped back, unsettled by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s cutting its ratings on a number of Italian banks late on Thursday. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 79.27 points or 1.23% at 6545.27 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.25% to 9786.96 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.18% lower at 4241.65 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB slipped 0.4% to 18,983.83 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.27% at 10,363.6 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.41% to 862.4 Russia\u2019s RTS edged up 0.41% to 768.06 Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.12% after two days of rises. Back with Russia and the rouble has risen by 4% to 59.53 to the dollar, while oil is 2% higher with Brent crude at $60.63 a barrel. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Back with Greece, and this week\u2019s presidential vote has been hit by bribery allegations. Helena Smith writes: Greece\u2019s presidential election descended into accusations of skulduggery on Friday as an opposition MP lobbed claims of attempted bribery at the government. With just four days to go before a second round of voting in the 300-seat chamber, Pavlos Haikalis, who represents the small, rightwing Independent Greeks party, said he had been approached by a middleman offering him a multimillion-euro inducement to support the ruling coalition\u2019s candidate for the post. \u201cThere was a preliminary discussion which started as a joke but then became very serious,\u201d the MP told Mega TV, adding that the interlocutor had not only offered to hand him \u20ac700,000 but to pay off his mortgage and provide advertising contracts. The Greek chamber reconvenes next Tuesday for a second vote after earlier this week the government fell far short of amassing the necessary 200 ballots for its nominee, the former European commissioner, Stavros Dimas. Full story here: Greek presidential elections hit by new bribery allegations Ukraine has seen its rating cut by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s from CCC to CCC- with a negative outlook. Capital Economics is also worried about a Russian banking crisis: The Russian ruble has rallied over the past 24 hours, but there are growing signs that the crisis is spreading to the banking sector. In particular, interbank interest rates have jumped to over 27%, which is well above the cost of central bank liquidity and suggests that the interbank lending market may be starting to freeze up. This has often been a precursor to banking crises and, as a result, the interbank rate will be a key indicator for investors to watch over the coming days and weeks. Evgeny Gavrilenkov, chief economist at the investment banking arm of Russia\u2019s largest lender Sberbank, has warned that the moves by the central bank to support the finance system could cause a \u201cfull scale banking crisis.\u201d According to Business Insider, he said: \u201cIf the Central Bank of Russia continues to provide refinancing in exchange for non-marketable securities that banks can generate in almost unlimited amounts, the system will gradually ramp up to full-scale banking crisis.\u201d He believes banks may prove unable to pay back loans from the central bank at the current 17% interest rate, and the collateral they provide may not be enough to cover any losses. Meanwhile Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament hastily approved a draft law on Friday that would give the banking sector a capital boost of up to 1 trillion roubles ($16.5 billion). Greece has received an extension to its second Economic Adjustment Programme financed by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). Instead of ending on 31 December 2014, the EFSF programme will now end on 28 February 2015. The EFSF said the decision followed a request from Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis. Back with the IMF, and the fund said it had failed to reach agreement with Ukraine which would allow the country to receive its next bailout trance in January. The fund said it had held productive discussions with officials in Ukraine this week, and would return for further talks in January. Ukraine has received two tranches under the IMF program worth $4.6bn. The IMF mission chief Nikolay Gueorguiev said: \u201cThe mission held productive technical discussions with the new economic team of the Ukrainian government and with the National Bank of Ukraine in the context of the Fund-supported program, covering key issues facing the economy. We found that the Ukrainian authorities are preparing to move decisively on a broad and comprehensive agenda to stabilize and reform the economy, while coping with the difficult challenges that emerged in the last year. In this context, we advanced substantially our mutual understandings of policy priorities going forward. \u201cDiscussions will continue over the coming weeks, following the mission\u2019s departure. The mission is expected to return to Kyiv for policy discussions with the Ukrainian authorities in January 2015.\u201d Wall Street is still flat; the FTSE is up 0.6% while the rest of Europe is still trading lower. Iceland has paid back, ahead of schedule, another chunk of the rescue package it received from the International Monetary Fund at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. The IMF announced today that the country had repaid SDR275m ($400.6m). This amounts to a fifth of the $2.1bn borrowed by Iceland from the IMF under its standby agreement, and cuts its IMF debts to $345.1m, which are expected to be paid back in 2015-16. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has opened flat at 17,779.85. European stock markets have fallen further, while London is still up. The FTSE 100 index is up 0.47% at 6496.19 France\u2019s CAC is down 0.76% at 4217.05 Germany\u2019s Dax has lost nearly 1% to 9714.95 Spain\u2019s Ibex has tumbled 1.15% to 10271.8 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has slid 0.75% to 18,919.07. Oil prices are holding on to their gains, with Brent crude trading 2.4% higher at $60.68 a barrel. The rouble has strengthened 4.55% to 59 against the dollar. Russia\u2019s richest man, Alisher Usmanov, has responded to president Putin\u2019s call on businessmen to bring their assets home. Usmanov has transferred his holdings in mobile operator Megafon and iron ore producer Metalloinvest to Russian entities, after Putin used his end-of-year press conference on Thursday to ask businessmen to \u201cde-offshore\u201d their assets. The relentless slide in oil prices since the summer could spark a buying spree in the energy sector, analysts say. Benchmark crude oil prices have nearly halved over the past six months to $60 a barrel, and energy companies have seen their share prices tumble. This means big oil companies flush with cash could pounce on smaller rivals. Repsol agreed to buy Canada\u2019s Talisman Energy for $8.3bn this week, which it says is the largest international deal by a Spanish company in the last five years. Investment bank BMO Capital Markets said: We believe the current environment will precipitate a wave of M&amp;A activity in the European exploration and production sector once the oil price stabilises and begins to firm. Staying with the oil theme, Sir Ian Wood, the oil veteran who produced a review of the North Sea oil and gas industry last year, has just issued this statement. He believes that, despite some very real challenges in the next 12 months, the North Sea oil industry will find itself in better shape in 2016. I read with real concern the comments yesterday that the UK offshore oil &amp; gas industry was \u201cclose to collapse\u201d. These comments are over the top for an industry which thinks and plans long term, has significant momentum from current production and from major investments made over the last two or three years, and where the operators make their investment decisions based on the anticipated price of oil in two to three years\u2019 time. It\u2019s important to have a balanced perspective at this time. The UKCS does face a very difficult year to 18 months which will see a slow down in investment, the loss of some offshore production, up to 10%, and the possible loss of around 15,000 jobs within an industry which employs 375,000, although this is difficult to estimate. It will be a tough time for the industry and the people that work in it, but we are entering a downturn from which we will recover. There are structural reasons to believe that the price of oil should recover, probably late 2015 early 2016, and there are reasons to believe that the industry should be in better shape to attract even more investment then because of initiatives currently underway. Here\u2019s a chart from Berenberg Bank. Analysts at Berenberg Bank believe cheap oil is a gamer changer. Holger Schmieding and Christian Schulz write: If oil prices remain close to current levels, the western world and many emerging markets can look forward to benefiting from a big de facto tax cut. Even better, the tax cut will be paid for by Russia and the Middle East. Like every major shift in relative wealth and prices, it is disruptive. But lower energy costs will leave consumers with more money to spend on other things. The additional fall in oil prices since late November should boost demand in the US and Europe by at least 0.5% over the next six quarters or so, and possibly more. Beyond the short-term stimulus to demand, cheaper oil can provide a more lasting boost to the world economy. Over the past 50 years or so the UK has experienced strong growth when the oil price has been low, and vice-versa. The picture is similar for other Western economies. The black gold matters \u2013 less so now than the 1970s, but nevertheless important. Slashing the price of a key input could, over time, boost productivity, allowing strong non-inflationary growth. In the jargon, oil may turn out to be a positive supply shock. They concede that there are risks too. Shale oil producers may be hurt, while Norway and the UK will lose out from their offshore oil sector. In general, some oil producers may have to cut spending before oil consumers spend their windfall gains. Also, markets may initially focus more on the risks for the few countries and companies that are being hurt badly than on the more widely dispersed gains for the many consumers. The big risks come from economic turmoil in Russia. Will its economy implode? Could this drive the wounded bear to lash out again with another expensive war? We need to watch the risk of a Russian crisis carefully. Most of the Western world barely blinked during the 1998 Russian crisis, but exposed Germany and Italy were hit materially for three quarters. But, they conclude The benefits of cheap oil far outweigh the costs. For anybody who ever argued for giving Western economies a fiscal boost, this is it. It is big, non-inflationary and paid for by somebody else. The euro is heading towards 28-month lows against the dollar as the ECB inched closer towards quantitative easing [see 10:57]. Also, data showed direct and portfolio investments in the eurozone dropped to \u20ac53bn in October from \u20ac62.6bn the month before, contributing to the euro\u2019s weakness. It hit $1.2253, close to the 28-month low of $1.2247 struck on 8 December. Eurozone bond yields are expected to stay at their current low levels for the next two years, according to ratings agency Fitch. In a report on European Government borrowing, Fitch said it expected eurozone and western European governments to borrow \u20ac1.8trn next year, in line with 2014. It added: Gross borrowing in 2015 will be around 13% of GDP and compares favourably with a 20% borrowing requirement in the United States and 50% in Japan. At \u20ac393bn or 24% of GDP, Italy has the highest projected borrowing requirement among European countries. Historically low yields will continue to support fiscal consolidation efforts in the medium term. Fitch expects 10-year yields in the eurozone to remain stable at the current low levels over the next two years, given weak growth and inflation dynamics and an easy ECB monetary policy. As debt stocks are refinanced, the favourable market conditions will feed into countries\u2019 debt servicing costs, providing a helpful boost to debt dynamics. Across Europe, the average effective interest rate paid on all general government liabilities has already fallen by around two percentage points since 2005, and Fitch expects it to fall further. From the European gross borrowing requirement for 2015, 3% is for Belgium, the only sovereign with a negative rating outlook, and 2% of the borrowing requirement is for sovereigns on positive outlook. 12 months ago, 30% of the borrowing requirement was for sovereigns on negative outlook. The outlooks of Italy (BBB+), the Netherlands (AAA), and Slovenia (BBB+) are now stable, and the outlooks for Cyprus (B) and Portugal (BB+) have been revised to positive from negative during the past year. A downgrade of Italian banks by ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s is being cited as one reason for the dip in European markets. The downgrade came late on Thursday, and shares in Italian banks have come under pressure as a result and helped pull the Italian and other peripheral markets lower. Reuters reported: Standards and Poor\u2019s cut its ratings on a number of Italian banks on Thursday, including UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, citing rising economic risks and a recent downgrade of Italy\u2019s sovereign rating. \u201cEconomic prospects in Italy are likely to be weaker than we had previously anticipated and weak overall in the next couple of years,\u201d S&amp;P said in a statement. The ratings agency cut Italy\u2019s sovereign credit rating earlier in December from BBB to BBB-, just one notch above junk, saying weak growth and poor competitiveness undermined the sustainability of its huge public debt. The full story of the downgrades is here. The rouble continues to rally, now up around 4% at just over 59 to the dollar. Meanwhile oil has also edged higher, up 1.1% at $59.92. While the FTSE in London is still up, trading 0.57% higher at 6503.09, European markets have turned negative as the Santa rally fizzles out. The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.14% lower, France\u2019s CAC has slid 0.26%, Spain\u2019s Ibex has lost 0.9% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB 0.8%. The survey comes a day after official figures showed a 1.6% jump in retail sales in November from October, with a spending splurge on Black Friday. Retail sales in the UK are the strongest since 1988, according to the CBI\u2019s latest survey. The sales volumes balance more than doubled to 61 in December from 27 in November. Meanwhile, European Central Bank officials are considering ways to ensure weak countries that stand to gain most from a fresh round of money printing bear more of the risk and cost, Reuters reported. Officials told the news agency that the ECB could ask central banks in countries such as Greece or Portugal to set aside extra money to cover potential losses from any bond-buying, reflecting the riskiness of their bonds. This could help persuade a reluctant Germany to back plans to buy state bonds. There is currently a stand-off between the ECB and Germany\u2019s Bundesbank over ECB plans to buy sovereign bonds to shore up the flagging euro zone economy. The deal would have given state-owned Gazprom greater access to gas trading and storage in Germany, while BASF\u2019s subsidiary Wintershall would have received more stakes in Siberian gas fields. BASF said: Due to the currently difficult political environment, BASF and Gazprom have decided not to complete the asset swap panned for the end of the year. In a surprise move, German chemical giant BASF and Russian energy company Gazprom have called off a major asset swap. The swap would have seen BASF subsidiary Wintershall transfer a jointly operated natural gas trading and storage business to Gazprom. The Russian parliament has rushed through a bill that will give the banking sector a capital boost of up to 1 trillion roubles ($16.5bn), as part of efforts to shield banks from western economic sanctions. Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis have restricted banks\u2019 access to international capital markets and sharply driven up their funding costs, in an economy that\u2019s sliding back into recession. The draft law has sailed through the state Duma and now needs to be passed by the upper house of parliament and then signed into law by president Putin. The Treasury was pleased. An HM Treasury spokesperson said: The week before Christmas has seen three pieces of good news confirming that the long term economic plan is working. Inflation has reached its lowest level for 12 years and regular earnings are growing in real terms for the first time since 2009. It is encouraging that today\u2019s figures show borrowing for the month is lower than last year, due to stronger receipts. However the effects of the great recession are still being felt in our economy and the public finances. That\u2019s why we will continue working through the plan that is building a resilient British economy. The state of Britain\u2019s public finances improved sharply last month, boosted by a \u00a31.1bn fine on banks for foreign exchange rate fixing. But income tax receipts, which had been weak until now, also improved. The government\u2019s deficit came in at \u00a314.1bn in November, down 10% from November 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics. The improvement was better than City economists had expected. However, it won\u2019t be easy for the chancellor to meet his new, less ambitious borrowing goals. He had to admit in the recent autumn statement that he would miss his target for cutting the deficit in the current financial year and announced a new one of \u00a391.3bn, nearly 6% higher than the old one. Japan\u2019s Nissan and French partner Renault have stopped taking orders for some cars in Russia and could further hike prices on others if the rouble\u2019s slide continues, the head of the Nissan-Renault alliance Carlos Ghosn said this morning. He told reporters at Nissan\u2019s headquarters in Yokohama (reported by Reuters): We have suspended taking orders. We didn\u2019t do it overall, just on some models. We said: \u2018Sorry, until we see where this situation is going we don\u2019t take orders.\u2019| Nissan has already raised prices on half the models sold in Russia by 5-8%. Russia is Nissan\u2019s fifth-largest market. Ghosn remained confident that the Russian car market would \u201cstabilise\u201d but added that the plunging value of the rouble made it hard to plan ahead. The bad news is that the market is shrinking. This is bad news for everyone. When the rouble sinks it\u2019s a bloodbath for everybody. It\u2019s red ink, people are losing money, all car manufacturers are losing money. This morning the rouble is actually up, underpinned by encouraging comments from the Russian finance minister \u2013 it is currently trading at 60.32 roubles to the dollar, up 2.5% on the day. Let\u2019s take another look at oil prices. While steady, Brent crude is still below $60 a barrel, close to a 5 1/2 year low amid a global oil glut. Oil prices are heading for a fourth week of declines after oil cartel OPEC decided not to cut production last month. Ken Hasegawa, commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan, told Reuters: Following the long and steep decline in oil prices, we have seen some buying interest in recent days. But there is still a lot of selling pressure. For now there is no significant halt in production and no change to the supply and demand situation. So oil prices can still go lower. Nearly all European stock markets are trading higher this morning, with the FTSE 100 index in London up 0.65% at 6507.73. Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.45% ahead at 9855.45, France\u2019s CAC has gained 0.68% at 4278.19, and Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 0.44% at 10,437.4. Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is bucking the trend with a 0.43% fall to 18,977.72. There was some bad news for Cyprus this morning, as the International Monetary fund said it would not release a further \u20ac88m in bailout funds. More here. Oil prices have steadied after a wild week. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is trading 15 cents higher at $59.42 a barrel while New York light crude is 35 cents ahead at $54.46 a barrel. In Russia, the rouble has strengthened 3.4% this morning, going below 60 against the dollar for the first time since Wednesday. Russia\u2019s finance minister Anton Siluanov confirmed his ministry had been selling foreign currency, Reuters reported. He also said the rouble would definitely firm early next year. Meanwhile, the Russian central bank announced that it did not intervene in the markets on Wednesday. It has spent more than $80bn defending the rouble this year. China has revised the size of its economy by $308.8bn \u2013 adding the equivalent of Malaysia\u2019s economic output. This makes the debt of the world\u2019s second-largest economy look smaller by comparison. China\u2019s GDP was 58.8 trillion yuan in 2013, according to the results of a nationwide economic census. That\u2019s 3.4% larger than before. Malaysia\u2019s GDP was $312bn last year. Bloomberg noted that the change was smaller than the last time a revision was made, in 2008, reflecting more accurate counting of the fast-growing services industry. The FTSE has opened nearly 50 points higher at 6512.11, a 0.7% rise. As mentioned earlier, German consumers are also more confident about their economy. The monthly survey by the GfK market research group shows consumer confidence rising to 9 points for January from 8.7 points in December. This is the highest reading since December 2006 when it hit 9.1 points. Gfk said: Consumers assume the economic weakness in Germany is only temporary and the domestic economy will return to the growth path in the next few months. The Bank of Japan held off announcing fresh measures (after unveiling a big expansion of its asset-buying programme in October) and offered a more upbeat outlook, raising hopes the third-largest economy could pull out of recession soon. Japan slipped into recession in the last quarter. Wrapping up a two-day meeting, the central bank said: Japan\u2019s economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend ... (while) overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies - have been recovering, albeit with a lacklustre performance still seen in part. In this situation, exports have shown signs of picking up. Business sentiment has generally stayed at a favourable level, although some cautiousness has been observed. Private consumption remains \u201cresilient\u201d while real-estate investment has \u201cstarted to bottom out\u201d, the bank said.. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. The Santa rally is here. The Bank of Japan has struck a more optimistic view of the economy which bodes well for global growth, fuelling a rally in Asian stocks. Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 2.4% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 1.3%, following big gains on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow Jones scored a 421 point gain as concerns over a Fed interest rate hike and lower oil prices eased. Over here, things are also looking more rosy, with German consumer sentiment hitting an eight-year high. European markets are expected to open higher. Equity market calls from Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets : FTSE100 is expected to open 77 points higher at 6,543 DAX is expected to open 108 points higher at 9,919 CAC40 is expected to open 56 points higher at 4,305",

Holger Schmieding and Christian Schulz write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If oil prices remain close to current levels, the western world and many emerging markets can look forward to benefiting from a big de facto tax cut. Even better, the tax cut will be paid for by Russia and the Middle East. Like every major shift in relative wealth and prices, it is disruptive. But lower energy costs will leave consumers with more money to spend on other things. The additional fall in oil prices since late November should boost demand in the US and Europe by at least 0.5% over the next six quarters or so, and possibly more.</p> <p>Beyond the short-term stimulus to demand, cheaper oil can provide a more lasting boost to the world economy. Over the past 50 years or so the UK has experienced strong growth when the oil price has been low, and vice-versa. The picture is similar for other Western economies. The black gold matters \u2013 less so now than the 1970s, but nevertheless important. Slashing the price of a key input could, over time, boost productivity, allowing strong non-inflationary growth. In the jargon, oil may turn out to be a positive supply shock.</p> </blockquote> <p>They concede that there are risks too.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shale oil producers may be hurt, while Norway and the UK will lose out from their offshore oil sector. In general, some oil producers may have to cut spending before oil consumers spend their windfall gains. Also, markets may initially focus more on the risks for the few countries and companies that are being hurt badly than on the more widely dispersed gains for the many consumers. The big risks come from economic turmoil in Russia. Will its economy implode? Could this drive the wounded bear to lash out again with another expensive war? We need to watch the risk of a Russian crisis carefully. Most of the Western world barely blinked during the 1998 Russian crisis, but exposed Germany and Italy were hit materially for three quarters.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, they conclude <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The benefits of cheap oil far outweigh the costs.

It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gross borrowing in 2015 will be around 13% of GDP and compares favourably with a 20% borrowing requirement in the United States and 50% in Japan. At \u20ac393bn or 24% of GDP, Italy has the highest projected borrowing requirement among European countries.</p> <p>Historically low yields will continue to support fiscal consolidation efforts in the medium term. Fitch expects 10-year yields in the eurozone to remain stable at the current low levels over the next two years, given weak growth and inflation dynamics and an easy ECB monetary policy. As debt stocks are refinanced, the favourable market conditions will feed into countries\u2019 debt servicing costs, providing a helpful boost to debt dynamics. Across Europe, the average effective interest rate paid on all general government liabilities has already fallen by around two percentage points since 2005, and Fitch expects it to fall further.</p> <p>From the European gross borrowing requirement for 2015, 3% is for Belgium, the only sovereign with a negative rating outlook, and 2% of the borrowing requirement is for sovereigns on positive outlook. 12 months ago, 30% of the borrowing requirement was for sovereigns on negative outlook. The outlooks of Italy (BBB+), the Netherlands (AAA), and Slovenia (BBB+) are now stable, and the outlooks for Cyprus (B) and Portugal (BB+) have been revised to positive from negative during the past year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-12-19T12:31:34.487Z\">at 12.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54941183e4b019234074e494\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-19T12:00:34.264Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A downgrade of Italian banks by ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s is being cited as one reason for the dip in European markets.</strong></p> <p>The downgrade came late on Thursday, and shares in Italian banks have come under pressure as a result and helped pull the Italian and other peripheral markets lower.

      "bodyText": "The role of the North Sea as a goldmine for future tax revenues and highly paid jobs is under threat unless something is done urgently to address a crisis triggered by plunging oil prices, the government was warned. Leading executives, politicians and union leaders said billions of pounds worth of Treasury income and 37,500 jobs were at risk and some want the tax burden to be lowered further in a bid to stimulate new activity and create longerterm fiscal revenues. Sir Ian Wood, a government adviser and former oil engineering boss, said 10% of the North Sea workforce could be in danger while Robin Allan, chairman of the independent explorers\u2019 association Brindex, told the BBC that the industry was \u201cclose to collapse\u201d. Jake Molloy, oil and gas organiser for the RMT union, said oil and gas companies had already started to make hundreds of redundancies, delay projects and scrap drilling contracts. \u201cIt is not just the oil price that is a recipe for disaster, its the level of taxes. Reducing them by 2% [as in the autumn statement] is not scratching the surface given they have been earlier raised by 40%.\u201c Frank Doran, MP for Aberdeen North, agreed. \u201cI think we have reached a stage in the (oil price) cycle where tax cuts have to be seriously looked at. The North Sea is one of the most expensive places in the world but it is not just about tax. I would want to see tax cuts tied to a reduction in costs through companies becoming more efficient.\u201d The North Sea is regarded as a high tax and \u201cmature\u201d basin with few opportunities for making the kinds of major discoveries still available in newer areas such as Brazil, Angola or even the deep water US Gulf. The tax rate on a barrel of oil produced in the North Sea is between 60% and 80% \u2013 and the industry wants that burden reduced. The price collapse has been caused by a huge growth in supply from the US shale fields coupled with a lower than expected growth in demand due to the faltering world economy. A decision by Opec late November to hold the output levels at existing levels triggered an even wider sell-off of crude which has spread panic among the oil companies. Allan said almost no new projects in the North Sea were profitable with oil below $60 a barrel. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to make money at these oil prices. It\u2019s a huge crisis,\u201d added Allan, who is a director of Premier Oil in addition to chairing Brindex. \u201cIt\u2019s close to collapse. In terms of new investments - there will be none, everyone is retreating, people are being laid off at most companies this week and in the coming weeks. Budgets for 2015 are being cut by everyone.\u201d Shell said late summer it would cut 250 onshore jobs from its North Sea operation in Aberdeen while BP is also cutting back although it has not given specific numbers. US-based oil giroup, ConocoPhillips, plans to reduce its staff headcount in the UK by 230 out of 1,650 posts while Texas-based oilfield services company Schlumberger cut back its UK-based fleet of geological survey ships ithis month, taking an $800m (\u00a3511m) loss and axing an unspecified number of jobs. Much of Aberdeen\u2019s future wellbeing \u2013 and the Treasury\u2019s tax take from the North Sea \u2013 depends on how long the current price slump will last and that could be influenced by many things, not least whether Opec will cut production in the spring. Alex Kemp, a professor and oil economist at Aberdeen University, predicted oil could fall from its current level of below $60 per barrel to $50 next year compared with levels of $115 in June. \u201c(In) the short term, the price could go down a bit more. There\u2019s nothing to stop it,\u201d he said in a prediction which would have devastating impact on tax revenues which are already rattling down as production falls. But Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, claimed the sharp crude price falls will be short-lived. He said: \u201cI am optimistic about the future. What we are facing now and what the world is facing is a temporary situation and (it) will pass.\u201d",

The business lobby group said shoppers thronged Britain\u2019s high streets in the two week to 11 December to take advantage of huge price discounts. Black Friday on 28 November played a major role in driving the surge in sales, but the major supermarkets also enjoyed a boost after grocery sales registered the strongest year-on-year growth in the sector. About 70% of respondents reported sales volumes up on a year ago, while 9% said they were down, the CBI said, giving a rounded balance of +61%, which was well above the +38% that had been expected and the highest balance since January 1988. Sales volumes for the time of year were above average with 22% of shops describing them as \u2018good\u2019 against 5% saying \u2018poor\u2019, giving a rounded balance of +16%. Barry Williams, Asda chief merchandising officer for food and CBI retail chairman, said Black Friday price-cuts were embraced more widely than ever by UK retailers and shoppers reacted by buying more goods. But he struck a note of caution when he said the remainder of the Christmas period could be weaker than previous years. \u201cShoppers may have caught the Christmas bug early and brought some of their spending forward. This has been a tough year for many retailers and parts of the sector are still struggling. \u201cIncreasing disposable income from real wages growth, and falling fuel prices are giving retailers reasons for optimism but we\u2019ll need to see in the new year whether the upbeat mood takes hold.\u201d The survey comes only a day after official data for November found that sales grew at a pace not seen for 10 years. The Office for National Statistics said Black Friday discounts and a dramatic fall in petrol prices over the last month provided shoppers with extra cash for other purchases. The CBI said internet sales grew only moderately on a year ago, bringing a sense of calm after a bonanza of sales in November. The survey also includes motor retailers, which remain in rude health after more than two years of double digit sales growth. Car manufacturing and sales account for much of the growth in manufacturing and consumer spending during the recovery, according to ONS figures.",

The Unilever company originally filed suit against Hampton Creek, a small California company, on the basis that the name Just Mayo amounted to false advertising because being egg-free meant it could not be defined as mayonnaise. It argued that the word \u201cmayo\u201d implied that the product was mayonnaise, and that Hampton Creek had stolen market share from Hellman\u2019s. Hampton Creek said it marketed its product as \u201cmayo\u201d rather than mayonnaise specifically to meet labelling regulations. Unilever said on Thursday that it had decided to withdraw the lawsuit so that Hampton Creek could address its labelling directly with industry groups and regulatory authorities. Hampton Creek\u2019s chief executive, Josh Tetrick, said there had been positive conversations with industry groups and government officials. He said the company may make the word \u201cjust\u201d larger on the label but had no plans to change the product\u2019s name. Just Mayo\u2019s label states that it does not contain eggs. The label features a white egg with a plant growing in front, which Tetrick said was the company\u2019s way of showing they used plants instead.

Whatever the reason, St Ives in Cornwall has been voted the ideal place to live by visitors to property website Rightmove. The town, which boasts an outpost of the Tate and the Barbara Hepworth Museum, topped a list of locations in a poll of 2,600 people who were asked where there ideal home would be. The desirability of St Ives has already helped push asking prices up by 7.6% over the past year, to an average of \u00a3375,383. The rest of the top three are both seaside towns, with Poole in second and Brighton in third. Edinburgh and York made up the rest of the top five. Rightmove\u2019s director Miles Shipside said: \u201cMany people choose to holiday by the sea, and given the choice of where to live they would like to make that a permanent arrangement. But it also seems many like the features of a smart town or city, so one near the coast seems the ideal location to live. St Ives was one of several locations in the south-west to crop up on the list, and combined the area accounted for a fifth of the votes. Why is St Ives so great? Let us know in your comments below",
