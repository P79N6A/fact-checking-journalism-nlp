      "bodyText": "'David Cameron genuinely tried to detoxify the Conservative party in the belief that his right wing had nowhere else to go \u2026 then along came Ukip.\" Thus spoke a senior Conservative figure recently, on the eve of Labour's truly amazing U-turn on economic policy in general and austerity in particular. The speaker was one of many traditional Conservatives who were bemoaning the way their party, still suffering the fallout from rightwing resentment at the defenestration of Margaret Thatcher 23 years ago, seemed to be tearing itself apart. I lost count of the number of Tories who complained that \"divided parties do not win elections\". Meanwhile, they noted with reluctant admiration how perceptive from the outlet had been the analysis by shadow chancellor Ed Balls of the weaknesses of George Osborne's economic strategy. They might not like Ed Balls; indeed, the shadow chancellor has a remarkable ability to put Conservatives' backs up; but how right he had been in predicting the failure of a strategy that has been dubbed with the oxymoron \"expansionary fiscal contraction\". Before we go any further, it is worth addressing those critics who argue that the austerity policy is not the cause of the crisis. The answer is simple: those, alas all too few, of us who go on about the austerity policy are perfectly aware that the roots of the depression lay, and lie, with the failure of the financial system. The point is that programmes of austerity in the UK and the eurozone have aggravated that crisis and been almost tailormade to prevent a recovery. Indeed, there is an impressive weight of evidence that recovery had begun in 2010, thanks to the collective impact of fiscal and monetary measures known as \"the stimulus\", but the recovery was aborted by the premature abandonment of the fiscal side of the stimulus. Indeed, pace the incoming governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, there is a limit to what monetary policy can do, as his central banking colleagues around the world are beginning to emphasise \u2013 a limit recognised decades ago by John Maynard Keynes, who emphasised the importance of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy involves changes in the levels of taxation and public spending, in order to stimulate a depressed economy or to cool down one that is overheating. That policymakers may have ignored the \"slowing down\" side of fiscal policy is no argument against what should be a fitting response to depression, namely fiscal expansion. The perversity of policies adopted in the UK and eurozone is that, far from going for fiscal expansion, the likes of George Osborne have deliberately opted for contraction. It is certainly easy to point out that even in this objective they are missing their targets. The point is that they have not opted for conscious expansion. They talk about the importance of growth but do nothing to stimulate it. Indeed, perversely, they do the reverse. Hence, after the sensational fiscal tightening of the coalition years, last week Osborne piled on the pressure with yet more planned cuts. Yet senior Labour party members, instead of capitalising on their success in attacking the government's failed strategy, choose to hoist the white flag and accept the broad thrust of the chancellor's policy, quibbling over the details, and even then sounding as though they are terrified of saying anything that might upset the rightwing press. They call this the need for credibility. Do they not see that in the very act of seeking credibility they are losing it? A veteran of many past Labour efforts at seeking credibility, Roy Hattersley, makes an appeal for sanity in a new book (The Socialist Way \u2013 Social Democracy in Contemporary Britain, I B Tauris). Labour has a choice, he says: \"It can grub about in search of policies which will attract the swing voters and lose the next general election or it can become again an indisputable party of principle and win.\" This economy, with masses of spare industrial and service capacity, and millions who are either officially unemployed or in work but underemployed, is crying out for a serious economic recovery programme. There are hundreds of thousands of houses or flats to be built, and there is a huge opportunity for investment in our public infrastructure \u2013 the infrastructure that the most rightwing entrepreneur requires in order to conduct private business. Labour should be planning tens of billions of spending, in an economy that is running up to 15% below what historical trends indicate is possible. It is not 1940s austerity under a Labour government that Ed Miliband should be evoking but 1950s recovery. The defence of Labour's U-turn is that \"this is all about politics\". Yet, as we were reminded by the Treasury's chief economic adviser, Dave Ramsden, last week, in a lecture at the Mile End Group, Queen Mary, University of London, it was because Balls rightly argued that the decision about entering the eurozone should be based on economics, not politics, that Gordon Brown instituted an enquiry based on what were known as \"the five tests\". Ramsden was the key civil servant in charge of that exercise, and he made clear in his lecture on the 10th anniversary of the unveiling of the results that the result was not predetermined by Brown or Balls but was a genuine analysis. Most people think Labour got it right putting the economic case above the political. It saddens me that they seem to be abandoning their economic case about austerity for what they seem to think is a short-term political advantage \u2013 which to my mind sounds dubious anyway.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney, the high-flying Canadian hand-picked by the chancellor to run the Bank of England, could hardly have heavier expectations weighing on his shoulders when he starts his new job tomorrow \u2013 Canada Day. George Osborne is hoping the slick former Goldman Sachs banker will shake up the fusty corridors of Threadneedle Street, fix the fragile banking system and put a rocket under the recovery. Yet he arrives at a time when economists \u2013 most recently at the central bankers' club, the Bank for International Settlements \u2013 are starting to question whether quantitative easing has reached the point where it is doing more harm than good. Meanwhile, investors are waiting anxiously for fresh signs of when Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke plans to begin \"tapering\" the $85bn (\u00a355.7bn) a month bond-buying spree that has helped pump up financial markets across the world. They are also combing every pronouncement from China's policymakers about the risks of a credit crisis. Carney has made it clear that he believes there is plenty that central banks can do to rekindle growth, even with rates at record lows. But at his first monetary policy meeting, starting on Wednesday, he will have to contend with the six members of the monetary policy committee who have repeatedly ignored Sir Mervyn King's arguments for a fresh round of quantitative easing. Carney will also have some tough hiring decisions to make, with two of the Bank's key deputy governors \u2013 Paul Tucker and Charlie Bean \u2013 due to leave within months. And with his \u00a3874,000 pay-and-perks package making him considerably more expensive than his predecessor, Carney will have a lot to prove. We asked five experts to offer their advice to the new governor. ANN PETTIFOR Director, Policy Research in Macroeconomics Last week the UK's gilt market suffered heavy falls and a rise in yields, a result of turmoil caused by the Federal Reserve's decision to drop long-term calendar guidance on the direction of interest rates in favour of a new, less predictable outcome: the 6.5% unemployment threshold. The 10-year UK government bond yield rose to 2.5% \u2013 way above the bank rate of 0.5%. On 25 June, the day of greatest upheaval, the UK's debt management office committed British taxpayers to paying 3.65% for the next five years on the \u00a35bn gilt it issued. This rise in yields is bound to increase rates on UK mortgages and loans, and lead to defaults. This will affect our zombie banks, weighed down by the world's heaviest private debt burden. As you know, the Bank of England does not help to co-ordinate monetary policy and the government's (unwise) debt management, and long ago gave control over the full spectrum of rates \u2013 short and long, safe and risky \u2013 to the \"invisible hand\" of \"submitters\" in banks, such as Barclays, operating in the Libor market. This misallocation of responsibilities is dangerous for Britain's private debtors, so please give the determination of the full spectrum of rates your full attention. PAUL MYNERS Former City minister Governor Carney, you need to restore the credibility of the Bank, make it fit for purpose and then get to grips with some very big issues. On the credibility front, I recommend that you immediately commission an independent review into the Bank's performance during the runup to the crisis. And you need to convince people that the Bank is committed to meeting the 2% inflation target. If you think the target is too low for the good of the economy and society, you should tell the chancellor he should either set a higher target or accept the consequences of you remorselessly pursuing the one he has given you. This brings me to your relationship with Mr Osborne. The Bank's monetary policies have provided excessive cover for his failed fiscal strategy. Tell him that the Bank has gone far enough and to go further would further compromise its integrity. And own up to the fact that the Bank's policies have political consequences \u2013 quantitative easing has penalised savers and rewarded borrowers. Insist on appointing your own deputy governors and delegate real authority to them \u2013 essential with the wider responsibilities now given to the Bank. Get to grips with the culture and bureaucracy \u2013 headcount doubled under Mervyn King. You don't need more than 150 economists in the monetary division of the Bank. The Bank's building looks impenetrable and its internal structure reeks of hierarchy, like a Freemason's hall. Bring in new people but protect the best of those you inherit \u2013 there are a couple of stars just below deputy governor level. Sell the building \u2013 I am sure it will appeal to an oil sheikh, oligarch or Holiday Inn. Donate the waiters' pink frock coats to Oxfam. Finally, on monetary policy, in a couple of years you are going to have to contend with unwinding QE (unless you think that by limiting your appointment to five years you might pass this hot potato to your successor) while at the same time funding a large running deficit. Investigate whether some of the \u00a3300bn of gilts currently owned by the Bank \u2013 effectively a borrower owning its own debt \u2013 could be cancelled. Some will say that this is inconsistent with your inflation obligation but you have plenty of tools to handle this. Let it be known that you are going to abstain at your first three meetings of the MPC. You need to get a better feel for the UK economy. Always vote last at MPC meetings \u2013 don't intimidate others with an early vote. I hope this helps. And don't overdo it with the housing allowance \u2013 avoid any postcode in which Goldman Sachs partners live. DANNY GABAY Director, Fathom Financial Consulting Mark, welcome back to London and congratulations on your new role. It is barely possible to exaggerate how crucial that role will be in shaping the UK's near-term, and perhaps its long-term, economic performance. That is not because monetary policy can fix everything but because it has an essential role to play in achieving escape velocity. But it will take fresh thinking. You have highlighted the key part played in the current crisis by overvalued housing, overleveraged households and overextended banks, not just in Canada but across the developed world. You were right to do so. That unholy axis is the fundamental problem facing the British economy. The UK banking sector has large, unrealised losses on its balance sheet, most relating to the household sector. There are other bad assets too, but the household sector is the big one. A related problem is the damage the banking crisis has wrought on the UK's supply potential. It will not be easy, but you must do your best to withstand the arrant nonsense of short-term wheezes such as Help to Buy, designed to boost short-term demand and court political favour, but certain to heap more on to the debt mountain. First, fix the banks. Housing is the principal troubled asset in the UK; a British version of Tarp [the US financial rescue scheme] must be part of the solution. ANDREW SENTANCE MPC member 2006-11, and senior economic adviser to PricewaterhouseCoopers Governor Carney, welcome to the UK and the task of managing the Bank of England through one of the most challenging periods in its history. Your main challenge over the next five years is to wean the UK economy off the current policy \u2013 very low interest rates and periodic injections of quantitative easing, which has sustained us through the crisis and the early phase of the recovery. This is not a task that can be left much longer. There are already signs that the long period of monetary stimulus from 2008/9 onwards is distorting our economy, sustaining high inflation and supporting a bubble in the stock market and in housing. Over the next five years, you will need to manage the transition to a more normal monetary regime \u2013 not the same as the one we left behind in 2007 but a level of interest rates and a financial climate that strikes a better balance between savers and borrowers than exists at present. That means raising interest rates to wean borrowers off life support and give a better deal to savers. This can only be achieved gradually and hence you need to start soon, and prepare the ground with your early public statements. Good luck! PAT MCFADDEN Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee Dear Mark, welcome to Britain and to your new job. The textbook response to a financial crisis adopted in recent years in the UK of loose monetary policy and tight fiscal policy has yet to produce any meaningful economic growth. You will be expected to be bold and imaginative in the use of monetary policy to try to address this, but be careful not to become the government's fall guy by allowing it to pass on to you responsibility for what it has failed to achieve. Our banking sector \u2013 which is huge relative to the rest of our economy \u2013 is going through a number of important reforms in terms of capital levels, ringfencing, regulation and most recently the standards and culture changes recommended by the parliamentary banking commission. Do what you can to drive these changes through but do not believe they alone are enough. It would be rash to claim that \"too big to fail\" has been resolved and there are still big questions around the size of these organisations and the potential risks they pose. Banking reform is not yet finished. Aim to keep a strong financial sector in the UK \u2013 but don't let it hold taxpayers or the rest of the economy to ransom. Good luck.

And don't overdo it with the housing allowance \u2013 avoid any postcode in which Goldman Sachs partners live.</p> <h2><strong>DANNY GABAY </strong><br><strong>Director, </strong><a href=\"http://www.fathom-consulting.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Fathom Financial Consulting</strong></a><strong> </strong><br></h2> <p>Mark, welcome back to London and congratulations on your new role. It is barely possible to exaggerate how crucial that role will be in shaping the UK's near-term, and perhaps its long-term, economic performance. That is not because monetary policy can fix everything but because it has an essential role to play in achieving escape velocity. But it will take fresh thinking.</p> <p>You have highlighted the key part played in the current crisis by overvalued housing, overleveraged households and overextended banks, not just in Canada but across the developed world. You were right to do so. That unholy axis is the fundamental problem facing the British economy. The UK banking sector has large, unrealised losses on its balance sheet, most relating to the household sector. There are other bad assets too, but the household sector is the big one.</p> <p>A related problem is the damage the banking crisis has wrought on the UK's supply potential. It will not be easy, but you must do your best to withstand the arrant nonsense of short-term wheezes such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/04/george-osborne-help-to-buy-moronic\" title=\"\">Help to Buy</a>, designed to boost short-term demand and court political favour, but certain to heap more on to the debt mountain.</p> <p>First, fix the banks. Housing is the principal troubled asset in the UK; a British version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program\" title=\"\">Tarp </a>[the US financial rescue scheme] must be part of the solution.</p> <h2><strong>ANDREW SENTANCE</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/overview.aspx\" title=\"\"><strong>MPC</strong></a><strong> member 2006-11, and&#xa0;senior&#xa0;economic adviser to </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/pricewaterhousecoopers\" title=\"\"><strong>PricewaterhouseCoopers</strong></a><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-411828782\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/About/General/2011/5/25/1306343193851/Andrew-Sentance-002.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Sentance\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Governor Carney, welcome to the UK and the task of managing the Bank of England through one of the most challenging periods in its history. Your main challenge over the next five years is to wean the UK economy off the current policy \u2013 very low interest rates and periodic injections of quantitative easing, which has sustained us through the crisis and the early phase of the recovery. This is not a task that can be left much longer. There are already signs that the long period of monetary stimulus from 2008/9 onwards is distorting our economy, sustaining high inflation and supporting a bubble in the stock market and in housing.</p> <p>Over the next five years, you will need to manage the transition to a more normal monetary regime \u2013 not the same as the one we left behind in 2007 but a level of interest rates and a financial climate that strikes a better balance between savers and borrowers than exists at present. That means raising interest rates to wean borrowers off life support and give a better deal to savers. This can only be achieved gradually and hence you need to start soon, and prepare the ground with your early public statements. Good luck!</p> <h2><strong>PAT MCFADDEN </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/Mr-Pat-McFadden/1587\" title=\"\"><strong>Labour MP</strong></a><strong> and member of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/treasury-committee/\" title=\"\"><strong>Treasury select committee</strong></a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-411828783\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/5/14/1242303524614/Pat-McFadden-MP-001.jpg\" alt=\"Pat McFadden MP\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pat McFadden MP Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dear Mark, welcome to Britain and to your new job. The textbook response to a financial crisis adopted in recent years in the UK of loose monetary policy and tight fiscal policy has yet to produce any meaningful economic growth. You will be expected to be bold and imaginative in the use of monetary policy to try to address this, but be careful not to become the government's fall guy by allowing it to pass on to you responsibility for what it has failed to achieve.</p> <p>Our banking sector \u2013 which is huge relative to the rest of our economy \u2013 is going through a number of important reforms in terms of capital levels, ringfencing, regulation and most recently the standards and culture changes recommended by the parliamentary banking commission.</p> <p>Do what you can to drive these changes through but do not believe they alone are enough. It would be rash to claim that \"too big to fail\" has been resolved and there are still big questions around the size of these organisations and the potential risks they pose. Banking reform is not yet finished. Aim to keep a strong financial sector in the UK \u2013 but don't let it hold taxpayers or the rest of the economy to ransom. Good luck.</p> <p><strong>Interviews by Heather Stewart, Katie Allen and Jill Treanor</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Anyone subjected to brash DFS adverts promising double discounts and 0% finance on sofas would think it was impossible for the furniture firm to get its products from anywhere other than low-cost factories in the developing world. However, the company is one of a number of British businesses, including Golden Wonder, Hornby and Aston Martin, that has stopped shipping products back to the UK and is transporting jobs to these shores instead, making it the biggest sofa manufacturer in Europe. At a DFS factory on an industrial estate in Derbyshire there are banks of sewing machines, state-of-the-art fabric cutters and gas-powered staple guns. Harvey Ellis, head of manufacturing at DFS, who oversees the 838 workers on three sites and in two woodmills, explained: \"Once we receive an order, it takes just four days to go from an order on our screens to being loaded on to a van. The frames are shipped in from our wood factory six miles away and we will make 3,000 pieces a week. Today we'll complete 900.\" In three years DFS has toned down its Chinese activities to join the march of the makers, increasing UK production by a quarter. One worker, nail gun at the ready, said he could cover an entire sofa with fabric \u2013 sewn by the factory's seamstresses \u2013 in less than 30 minutes. It is a skill in much demand. The desire for British-made products has become so great that the factory in Alfreton has just increased its workload, adding an extra shift to keep it running 16 hours a day. Along with two more factories in Doncaster and Long Eaton, it means DFS now makes nearly all of its fabric sofas in the UK, accounting for half of all furniture sold by the company. Only the labour-intensive leather products are still made abroad. DFS chief executive Ian Filby said he wanted to see the business return to its British roots, and that customers now asked why the company did not make more of its UK credentials. \"Customers are astounded to think that a value-for-money player is also a major UK manufacturer,\" he said. Then, with a nod to the dark days of the three-day week, he added: \"We all know about the bad old seventies, but the historical mindset of 'all UK manufacturing is shoddy' has gone full circle and people now see the UK as the sort of place where people work hard and make a decent crust. People believe that quality product is made in the UK and aren't going to buy British if the product is poor.\" DFS appears to have tapped into a patriotic zeal among the British public. Its market share has risen from 25% to 28% in the last three years and Filby believes that there are also compelling financial reasons for bringing work back to the UK. \"I'd be surprised if there's not a lot of British manufacturers wanting to be more responsive to shorter lead times. We're never going to compete with the sweatshops of the Far East as a country, but you can manufacture here as long as you're adding design or R&amp;D [research and development]. I think the other phenomena which people recognise and is going to continue, is that moving things around the globe is expensive.\" And it is not just DFS that has seen the benefits of shifting work back to the UK. This year Golden Wonder revealed that its Pot Noodle snack will be made in Leeds instead of being shipped 10,000 miles from China, and Aston Martin Rapide S cars are now built in the Midlands, while clothing businesses including Topshop and Marks &amp; Spencer are selling more British-made outfits. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF manufacturing association, explained that manufacturing in the UK was increasing as costs overseas grew and customers became more demanding. \"I think customers would be surprised by how much is made in the UK,\" she said. \"There is a lingering perception that it is still made overseas. Manufacturing output is higher now than the 1980s in real terms, although we're still 11% below our pre-recession peak. There's been big investment in technology and equipment, while there is also a focus now on innovation to look beyond the product.\" Model railway maker Hornby is another example, shifting its paint production back to the UK from China after there were fears that any quality issues would take several weeks to be resolved. Executive chairman Roger Canham added that making products closer to home helped businesses respond to demand \u2013 and check for errors \u2013 more easily. \"It takes four weeks for a shipment to arrive from China, which means if you want to check the quality you have to wait until it arrives,\" he said. \"Now, if I want to check all I need to do is jump in a car and go to the factory. \"There was a huge surge in manufacturing from China in the 1990s, but now that wages are increasing and shipping is more expensive it's slowed down. We've got a new range of Airfix quick- build models which we will manufacture in the UK because it gives us a better chance to respond to demand quickly.\" And with the shift in work back to the UK come much-needed new jobs, at a time when youth unemployment running at around 20%. Filby said he would create 250 new jobs at DFS this year, having hired 400 new people in the 18 months to January, and revealed that one of the benefits of having UK factories was the loyalty he got from the staff who had worked there for generations. At Alfreton, for example, nearly half the staff have been there for five years, and 35% have notched up 10 years' service. Owned by private equity group Advent, DFS has promised to reward staff for their loyalty with 1% of any profit made from the company's sale, which is expected to happen over the next few years. Another reason why British workers will welcome the return of a manufacturing base that dwindled for decades but is showing renewed determination to compete with the rest of the world.",
