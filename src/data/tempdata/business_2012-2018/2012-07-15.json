      "bodyText": "With Bob Diamond out of the way and the economy flat on its back, there can be no better time than now to revisit the banks and what they are doing to support growth. The answer is not much, and the reason dates back to the crisis. They are still bombed-out shells where once magnificent institutions stood. Only governments think they are worth supporting. Private investors can't see the point. Or more accurately, they can't see a dividend payout any time soon. Without private cash from pension funds or sovereign wealth funds to boost their reserves, the banks have no capital cushion to fall back on. And a capital cushion is the basis for lending. The result is that banks call in loans and refuse to issue new ones. The nationalised banks, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, are the worst hit while Barclays and HSBC are limited in what they can do, especially while the eurozone crisis persists and nervous international money markets raise the cost of funding. That nervousness has swept through large corporates on both sides of the Atlantic and on the continent. Mindful of this worsening situation, the Bank of England has stepped in with a funding for lending scheme. First outlined in June by the central bank's governor in his Mansion House speech, it will come into effect next month. If the banks take the money on offer there should be higher lending figures in September for Sir Mervyn King to boast about. However, there is every likelihood banks will take the money but overall lending will be static. The euro crisis shows no signs of abating, which means nervous investors will continue to charge banks a higher rate for access to their funds, thus offsetting cheaper sources of finance from the Bank of England. In this way, the funding for lending scheme will act much like quantitative easing, which puts a floor under the worsening situation but is incapable of lifting economic growth. The Bank is well aware that its latest lending policy could simply mitigate problems elsewhere. It makes clear it stepped into the fray following reports from the high street lenders that a severe contraction in lending is on its way. Investec's chief economist, Philip Shaw, illustrates the point with the Bank of England's own figures. \"They show that the stock of bank loans to the corporate sector peaked in August 2008 at \u00a3517bn, and they have since fallen back by \u00a395bn, or by 18%,\" he said. \"Indeed data for May showed that bank loans to companies were still declining by 3% on the year. In particular small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), which in terms of their borrowings have few alternatives to banks, have experienced a decline of 4%.\" Some analysts dismiss the SME sector. After all, the biggest companies, those with over 250 employees, account for more than 80% of investment. Shaw disagrees. \"We reiterate our view that SMEs are an important but largely neglected area of the UK economy. They provide almost 50% of UK gross turnover. They also account for almost 60% of UK private sector employment,\" he said. Yet investment and innovation are the keys to an economy's ability to employ lots of people, and that is not just about bank loans to businesses. The National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts, in a report published on Monday, has attempted to lift the debate about the progress of the UK economy with publication of its third innovation index. Mainstream economists have described how the financial crisis has encouraged not just international investors, but major companies, to hoard their cash and keep it safe. A safety first policy means putting it in the bank. As long as there are scary developments on the horizon, such as the return of Silvio Berlusconi as Italian prime minister, a Spanish debt default or a prolonged recession in the UK, there is a strong appeal to investing in safe haven assets such as German government bonds. Nesta, a National Lottery-funded thinktank, argues the problem goes back further. It says UK economy has experienced a \"lost decade\" of innovation, with new evidence showing that businesses had a crisis of confidence in the early 2000s. The analysis ties the loss of confidence in Britain as a place to invest to the time of the dotcom bust and the ultra-low interest rates that followed. Those interest rates were used to invest in property as a safe haven, rather than to generate income through new products. Nesta's latest Innovation Index puts a figure on the decline in investment. It says British businesses have reduced the amount by \u00a324bn since the recession began. The decline has continued in the past two years of \"recovery\". To put the shortfall in context, Nesta says it is five times the amount the government spends each year on science and technology research. Geoff Mulgan, the former New Labour strategy adviser and Nesta's chief executive, said other countries were prioritising investments in new ideas while UK businesses haggled over commercial-property prices. Getting rid of Diamond was a necessary step, if only because the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme is wide open for bank bosses to line their pockets again and Diamond never lost any sleep receiving millions of pounds from the Barclays cashpoint after some generous government support. But the problems go wider. Weak banks are one issue, a reluctance among large companies to spend their large cash piles is another. And if that reluctance goes back to the early 2000s, the UK has a bigger mountain to climb.",

      "bodyText": "BP will open discussions this week with potential purchasers over the sale of its half of joint Russian venture TNK-BP, which could lead to a $30bn windfall. The oligarchs who belong to the Alfa Access Renova (AAR) consortium that own the other 50% of the venture will tell BP they want to exercise their right to negotiate for the stake. The Russians have indicated they will only offer $7bn (\u00a34.5bn), for half of the BP stake, claiming that a further $3bn would be accounted for by AAR dropping claims for compensation over the failure of a previous attempt by BP to tie up a separate deal with Rosneft against the wishes of the oligarchs. BP, which has been in conflict with its Russian shareholders for a long time, will on Saturday be allowed to widen purchase talks to some of other companies that have expressed an interest in the 50% holding as a 45-day notice period runs out. Neither BP nor AAR was willing to comment but industry sources confirmed that moves to finalise the future TNK-BP ownership structure would move into a different phase this week. A host of major names have been suggested as alternative buyers to AAR, including ExxonMobil and Shell as well as Chinese and Russian firms. Most independent analysts believe BP could obtain as much as $30bn for its stake. None of those alternative firms has publicly confirmed their interest and in an interview with the Wall Street Journal two weeks ago Alfa Group chairman, Mikhail Fridman, claimed there were \"no serious buyers\" outside his own consortium. He also believed that the Kremlin would support an AAR takeover while \"any foreign company would face a very complex process of getting approvals\". AAR is said to have failed to drum up support from the international loan market for a $20bn financing that would help it to acquire BP's stake, according to the International Financing Review website. That publication speculated that AAR might eventually turn out to be a seller of its own 50% stake rather than a buyer. BP announced on 1 June that it had received a number of unsolicited approaches for a stake that had yielded enormous profits for the UK oil company since it was bought in 2003 for $8bn. In a separate development, the head of BP's London-based tanker chartering business, who had been suspended pending a bribery investigation, has left the company. BP said that Lars Dencker Nielsen had left for \"personal reasons\" while its internal inquiry and that of the Serious Fraud Office continued. The whereabouts of Dencker Nielsen was unknown but the Danish national has previously denied any wrongdoing while BP said his post was being filled temporarily by \"regional managers\". The affair emerged in April when a whistleblower inside BP sent a letter to its chief executive, Bob Dudley, as well as one to the SFO, setting out what he claimed was a five-year catalogue of bribery and corruption within the chartering department of BP Shipping. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 July 2012.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It may boast a presence in the knicker drawer of almost every woman in the country, but it would seem the great British public think that Marks &amp; Spencer is, well \u2026 pants. Despite high-profile advertising campaigns featuring sophisticated supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and a frolicking Twiggy, Myleene Klass and Dannii Minogue, we still can't be persuaded to buy its clothes. Last week, the company announced its worst first-quarter results in three years as the chief executive, Marc Bolland, confessed that general merchandise sales \u2013 90% of which is clothing \u2013 are down 6.8%. Excuses were aplenty, with weakening market conditions and unseasonal weather proffered as reasons for poor performance, but the truth is a tougher pill for the executive board to swallow: M&amp;S, the stalwart of the British high street, is floundering inelegantly at the deep end of the fashion pool, while being left behind by its competitors. Just last month, Next overtook the veteran trader as the most valuable retailer on the London Stock Exchange. And, on the same day M&amp;S delivered its dire statement, the 12-year-old upstart Asos announced total sales growth of a staggering 49% (7% in the UK and 103% internationally). So why is it that even in these straitened times people are spending what little disposable income they have with a relative newcomer, whose business is wholly virtual, while good old Marks \u2013 part of the fabric of British society with more than 700 stores across the nation \u2013 is struggling to woo customers? \"Asos live and breathe their target customer,\" said Caroline Nodder, editor in chief of fashion industry trade bible Drapers. \"The people that work for them are the very same people they are selling to, and they know their needs and desires inside out. In contrast, M&amp;S are trying to be all things to all people with all those sub-brands: they've alienated their core customer and have failed to attract new ones. Amazing customer service used to be the hallmark at M&amp;S, but Asos have come along and set the benchmark for a whole new kind of positive customer relationship.\" Nick Robertson, the founder and CEO of Asos, is the man who had the vision to create that online shopping experience. Originally launched in 2000 as an acronym of \"as seen on screen\", the fledgling website delivered film and TV-influenced fashion to the celebrity-obsessed youth market. Today, his site is the online destination for style-conscious twentysomethings \u2013 and often their mums, work colleagues and younger siblings. Even some of the stars whose outfits inspired the site wear Asos clothes. With more than 65,000 products listed for sale at any given time, the range changes rapidly in response to customer demand, with an appetite-whetting mix of affordable own-label merchandise sitting alongside familiar high street brands such as River Island and Whistles, as well as aspirational pieces from designers including Stella McCartney, Paul Smith and Vivienne Westwood. Robertson's business model has also continually adapted to deliver innovations such as Asos Marketplace, a forum where customers can sell their own clothes through the website. \"Shopping has evolved over hundreds of years, from marketplacesin market towns, through to small shop fronts, then on to department stores, which were essentially bigger, more organised marketplaces,\" said Robertson from his London HQ last week. \"The internet has rewritten the rules again, but essentially it has always been as much about service as product. At Asos, I deliver the two in equal measure: the proposition and the service. Service isn't lower down the board, because it's fundamental to customer loyalty: it needs to be simple, seamless and quick for consumers to get the best possible experience, so right from the start I wanted free delivery and easy returns.\" These are the guiding principles of a successful online venture: when you are shipping 40,000 parcels a day to customers who want instant gratification, you have to meet those demands, or hopefully exceed them. \"We take an average twentysomething and look at her wardrobe, which is a mix of high street brands, a bit of vintage and something she's saved up for from a designer label,\" said Robertson. \"We then sell that back to her, in all its forms. Why wasn't I afraid to sell other brands and let our customers sell their own cast-offs through our site? Because she's going to do it anyway, and I'd rather keep her on board with us, than have her click off on to another competing site.\" Anouszka Budny, a glamorous, style-conscious 20-year-old history undergraduate at Exeter University, is typical of the Asos customer and said it is \"the go-to site whenever I want something new for my wardrobe. All my friends buy their clothes there: you can order a new outfit from the sofa the day before a night out, an interview or a wedding and they always deliver. \"It doesn't matter what I want, I always find things I like there, and the free delivery and ease of return is definitely an incentive to buy and try. My mum, who is 52, and my 18-year-old brother are also big fans, so they are reaching out to a wider audience than you think.\" Of course, Asos and M&amp;S aren't directly competing in the same demographic market, and there is a plethora of other stores \u2013 online and in the high street \u2013 competing for customers' hard-earned cash. Even Amazon is eating its way into the lucrative clothing market, and stores such as Oasis, Warehouse and Whistles all offer same-day delivery (in certain postcodes) on their websites. Zara, Mango, J Crew and Banana Republic are all examples of the globalisation of fashion, an increasingly competitive arena. Philip Green's Topshop has capitalised on phenomenal success at the turn of the millennium with a brilliant online offering that ensures those who have access only to small regional stores can enjoy the comprehensive collection featured in the world-renowned Oxford Circus flagship \u2013 and he's just announced a distribution deal with the US department store Nordstrom. But Asos and M&amp;S are extreme case studies demonstrating the inspiring success story and the tired underachiever of modern retailing. Many believe that for too long M&amp;S has assumed it has a special place in the hearts and wardrobes of British women, but has failed to evolve with the needs and tastes of those people. The retail guru Mary Portas is vociferous in her thoughts on the matter: \"Asos is simply brilliant. They know their customer and they focus on what she wants. Marks have failed to keep up. A little tweak at board level [M&amp;S's head of general merchandise, Kate Bostock, left \"by mutual consent\" following the trading announcement last week] with short-term plans to appease shareholders isn't enough here: they need to completely redefine how they do business. \"They need to go really deep into the brand and strategically plan where they want to be in 10 years, and stop limping along, lurching from one disaster to another. They need someone to come along and do what Mickey Drexler did with J Crew in the USA, changing the entire proposition and perception of the brand, making the whole associated experience a positive one. I feel like Marks's stores haven't changed a bit in the last 10 years: they look out of date.\" She added: \"The retail environment at Marks &amp; Spencer simply isn't inviting or exciting any more. It doesn't appeal to anyone. The whole world was once at their feet, and they simply let it walk on by because they didn't make the effort to move on with their customer. Even if they are the only fashion retailer in a town, they can't assume that women will shop there any more, because those women know they can buy online. \"Just having that many doors on the high street doesn't give them a captive audience and they have to stop the rot. I've seen what the closure of Woolworths did to the British high street, and M&amp;S would be an absolute disaster. It's not too late to do something, but it needs to be drastic.\"",
