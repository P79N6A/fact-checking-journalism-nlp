      "bodyText": "You never know when an impromptu act of derring-do \u2013 such as performing an emergency tracheotomy or stopping a runaway hot air balloon \u2013 will be required, so it's always best to be prepared. That philosophy has kept Victorinox, the maker of Swiss army knives, in business for 125 years: the examples above are real occasions when its trusty red pocket knives have saved the day. \"The knife for us is more than just a knife: it is a friend and a companion,\" says chief executive Carl Elsener earnestly. The torch-bearer of the company behind one of Switzerland's most famous exports is in London before a big advertising push to raise awareness of the brand, founded by his great-grandfather Karl Elsener in 1884. Victorinox is still based in the same Swiss town of Ibach, its modern factory nestling in a scene so picturesque it looks like a chocolate bar wrapper: snow-capped Alps towering behind and cows grazing in the adjoining fields. But after worrying about corkscrews and toothpick attachments for more than a century, the company now harbours ambitions to become a global lifestyle brand and is applying the Swiss precision engineering behind its knives to luggage, watches, clothing and even perfumes. The \"Swiss Army for Her\" fragrance promises to \"whisk away the senses to the lofty heights of the Swiss Alps\". Like the original pocket knife, which has evolved from a chunky wooden-handled effort to a hi-tech tool boasting a memory stick and laser pointer, Victorinox has also developed creatively. In 2000 the Elsener family effectively handed ownership to their employees, giving 85% of the company to a foundation and the remainder to a charity that is endowed with 10% of the firm's annual profits. The rest are ploughed back into the business. \"The family no longer owns the company and if it was ever sold, the money would go into the foundation and we would have to come up with a new goal for it,\" explains Elsener. In common with many other family-run enterprises, the company, which had annual sales of \u20ac412m (\u00a3335m) last year, takes a long-term view. \"In our history we have never looked at quarterly results,\" says Elsener. \"We always tried to think in generations.\" The foundation, he says, was established so that the company could remain financially independent: \"We wanted to make sure the company was not destabilised by the next generation. We are 11 children and there are already 23 grandchildren.\" Elsener says Victorinox products epitomise \"typical\" Swiss traits such as inventiveness and reliability; it is his wife Veronika, one of the company's marketers, who acknowledges, in jest at least, that the fastidious Swiss can be \"a little bit boring\". \"We are down to earth, definitely,\" she explains. \"Especially where our company is based. It is in the mountains where people tend to be a little bit conservative. But they are also pushed to the limits in order to survive, so you have to look outwards.\" When Elsener started the firm in the 19th century, Switzerland was one of the poorest countries in Europe, and a paternalistic approach to staff has been handed down through the generations. The philosophy extends to pay, with the highest earner receiving no more than five and a half times that of the lowest. \"We have always felt that what you exaggerate is not healthy and today you see companies who exaggerate and it is never good,\" says Elsener. \"It does not build mutual trust and respect.\" It all sounds too good to be true and Elsener agrees it is an unusual set-up, shaped by \"unobtrusive\" Christian values: \"It is a unique situation for 11 children to come to the same conclusion and give away a big part of their wealth. For us the long-term success of the company was always our main objective.\" Elsener joined his father at the office in 1978 and says the company \u2013 named after his great-great-grandmother Victoria \u2013 has been consistently profitable although it does not disclose its returns. Half of the 1,800 employees are based in Ibach and such it is importance to the local economy the area has been nicknamed \"Swiss army knife valley\". The family is proud of the fact that, to date, it has never had to make staff redundant because of a downturn in sales. \"We will do whatever is possible to continue with this philosophy,\" he adds. Over the decades, Victorinox has targeted hobbyists such as fishermen and mountaineers \u2013 one frightening-looking model, the SwissChamp XLT, boasts 50 tools, including a wire-crimping blade and pharmaceutical spatula. Elsener's favourite new feature is the LED light, although he admits his father, a purist who turns 90 this year, cannot understand the appeal of the memory stick. \"I am a big fan of the LED,\" he says pulling out a long key chain that jangles with three Victorinox tools. \"Many times it has offered me great service.\" His fascination with LEDs has become a running joke with his three children, not least because he keeps incorporating them in new products, including the zipper slider of a jacket. That urge to diversify intensified after 9/11, when the security crackdown at airports resulted in a 30% drop in knife sales. \"September 11 showed us how dangerous it can be when you are just on one strong leg,\" says Elsener, who reports new business areas now account for more than 60% of sales. Victorinox is also under attack from increasingly sophisticated counterfeit producers in Asia. \"We had to ask ourselves how could we continue to manufacture in Switzerland and stay competitive? When the quality of a copy is getting close to the original, but at half the price, then the only solution is to invest in brand,\" he says. Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders says it makes sense for Victorinox to broaden its product range to gain wider appeal: \"Most professionals don't need to carry a pen knife around with them \u2013 it's quite a niche market. People are willing to spend on products that are interesting and durable and that is what the Swiss army brand stands for.\" After 125 years, the penknife market is yet to be saturated, with Elsener reporting growth of more than 10% in the first three months of the year as its luggage and clothing provide walking adverts for the brand. \"I think the knives, even the standard one, [are] still relevant. When you see a young boy who is seven or eight years old and his father offers him a Swiss army knife, you still see his eyes light up.\"",

      "bodyText": "At the end of last month, 5,000 people marched through Dublin to protest against the imposition of a \u20ac100 (\u00a380) household tax that the Irish government was already struggling to collect from voters sick of austerity measures imposed on a stagnating economy. It was a small demonstration by the standards of some that have taken place across Europe in recent months \u2013 in places such as Syntagma Square in Athens, or in Spanish cities during the general strike that took place just before the Dublin protest \u2013 but numbers on the streets are not everything these days. As polls in Ireland revealed last week, support for the coalition government's policies is collapsing, while backing for Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 which is calling for a \"no\" vote in next month's referendum on the EU fiscal compact that would bind member states other than the UK, which opted out, to budget deficits of 3% or less in perpetuity \u2013 has propelled it into the rank of Ireland's second most popular party after Fine Gael. Whether there will still be a fiscal compact to vote on, when the Irish go to the polls, is a moot point. The likely winner of the second round of the French presidential elections next Sunday, the Socialist, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2013 who some polls put nine points ahead of the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy \u2013 has said he would revise the deal. In recent days, the Dutch coalition government has been brought down by the departure of Geert Wilders's far-right Freedom party, which was unwilling to sign up to a budget in line with the EU's belt-tightening package, even though the Dutch government has been one of the most aggressively in favour of imposing harsh austerity measures on members such as Greece and Portugal. Indeed, opinion polls in the Netherlands suggest that if elections \u2013 set for September \u2013 took place today, parties opposing the austerity regime might, both to the left and far right, win up to a third of seats. While some analysts have pointed to Hollande's emergence as the leader of a pan-European anti-austerity movement, others believe that something more complex is occurring \u2013 a \"game-changing moment\" in Europe in which individual electorates are emboldened to push back and debate new strategies by events they see taking place in other countries. What is being demanded by voters, as European debt has continued to balloon along with unemployment, even as growth has evaporated, is nothing less than a \"Plan B\" \u2013 an alternative to the dominant anti-austerity drive. Significantly, for the first time those calls are gaining real traction. \"The one thing you notice,\" says Eoin O'Malley, a politics lecturer at Dublin City University researching reactions to the European crisis, \"is how the push back in one country [against austerity] is influencing politics elsewhere. You see Hollande's comments in France and the fall of the Dutch government influencing how voters here see the Irish referendum on the fiscal compact and believing increasingly they can say no. If you ask me now, I would bet that a no vote was more likely than it was last week.\" In just a few weeks, the long-running European debt catastrophe that has stumbled from summit to bailout to the fall of governments has been transformed into a far more corrosive crisis of legitimacy that is increasingly pitting electorates against the established political castes. From London to Madrid, from the EU's northern core to its periphery, voters have begun to resist policies tightly predicated on targets and deadlines for reducing debt to satisfy the markets and ratings agencies that have no means for encouraging growth. While in London and Berlin politicians and officials have stuck to the script \u2013 that there is no Plan B \u2013 elsewhere the past few weeks have seen increasing signs that senior EU and government officials are rapidly waking up to the risks posed to the EU by the new public mood of resistance. This has seen politics return to reassert itself in a crisis that has for long been dominated by economic considerations and has led to the fall of five European governments so far. Last Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal quoted unnamed officials tentatively suggesting that a debate had begun on whether to soften the 2009 targets for reducing debt to 3% of GDP by 2013. \"The debate is not to be excluded,\" the paper quoted one EU official as saying, \"but it could give a signal that we are easing up at a time when we are struggling to show that we can keep the system.\" By Friday, that debate \u2013 initiated by Hollande \u2013 had been taken up in unexpected places. Mario Monti, the technocratic prime minister of Italy installed precisely to pursue an austerity regime, became the latest leader to criticise a policy focused only on cutting. \"If there is no demand, growth will not materialise. All the reforms we are putting in place now are deflationary,\" he said. Last Thursday, the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, said that growth needed to be pushed to the front of the debate, although he later cautioned: \"There are no magic formulas.\" He was responding to the European Central Bank's Mario Draghi, who on Wednesday told the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee that a fiscal compact needed to be followed by a \"growth compact\". It is a debate that has been accompanied by loud and febrile commentary from economists and analysts in the media, who have become emboldened to declare Europe's much-heralded bailout, less than two months old, stillborn. In the New York Times last week, Nobel prizewinning economist Paul Krugman \u2013 long at the forefront of criticising austerity measures \u2013 denounced the failed \"zombie economic policies\" of Europe's (and America's) \"austerians\". In the Financial Times, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Torreblanca, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, reflecting a growing view even within the conservative Spanish administration of Mariano Rajoy, whose government's credit rating was on Friday downgraded a second time, announced: \"Time to say 'basta' to the nonsense of austerity.\" None of which is what Germany and its chancellor, Angela Merkel, want to hear before a key vote in May in the German parliament that would not only approve the fiscal compact, but even more importantly, the European Stability Mechanism \u2013 the region's new emergency bailout fund. Other events on the horizon include elections in Greece and the French legislative elections in June, all of which threaten to turn a growing anti-austerity moment, underpinned by rising populism, into a major crisis. If there is one place, however, where the anti-austerity backlash is not being felt, it is in Germany, where the prescription from politicians and central bankers for Europe's problem cases remains largely unchanged. It was reiterated in comments to the New York Times last week by Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank and formerly a top adviser to Merkel, who warned that agreements previously made must be respected, even at the loss of some \"national sovereignty\". Ulrike Gu\u00e9rot, a colleague of Torreblanca and senior research fellow and representative for Germany on the European Council on Foreign Relations, explains: \"It is different for the German government. It can still withstand the wider sense of political crisis because there is no unemployment at 50%, as there is in Spain, and no rising political populism.\" Despite that, she believes that outside Germany \"a game change is coming\" that Merkel will not be able to ignore. While Gu\u00e9rot believes that the rapid change in the tone of the debate may cause a moment of political crisis for Europe, she also argues that the imminent ending of \"Merkozy\" \u2013 the lockstep relationship between France and Germany embodied in Merkel and Sarkozy that has driven European economic and political policy \u2013 may be a good thing. \"What is happening is serious. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande seems to be emerging as a leader of a pan-European anti-austerity movement.\" Gu\u00e9rot believes that the \"symbiotic relationship\" of Sarkozy and Merkel as the driving engine for EU policy may have contributed in large measure to the feeling by many countries and electorates that they were being excluded from the debate. \"There is an advantage to the end of the Merkel-Sarkozy relationship in that it will open up room for new disputes, new ideas and new debate.\" Not least, she adds, over a necessary realignment in the relationship between democracy in the EU and the influence of the markets. \"We are not talking growth versus austerity. The debate is over what kind of growth we need.\" And, she adds, over whether the targets in the fiscal compact are too tight. \"We can't just save. We need to invest. The world isn't going to end if the 3% target is missed by a few points next year.\" While some argue that a full-blown political crisis in Europe that leads to a rejection of the German-led austerity measures might force a crisis in Germany over Europe, Gu\u00e9rot believes that the most likely outcome is a renegotiation. \"Merkel is a survivor and pragmatic. And I think Hollande knows that he will need an accommodation, too. If this fiscal compact falls \u2013 if there is a second version \u2013 it will have to be faced.\" While analysts such as Gu\u00e9rot might be relaxed about such an outcome, for those politicians at the heart of the growing storm the stakes could not be higher. On Friday, in Dublin, it was the turn of Ireland's deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore, whose Labour party has been crucified in opinion polls for its support for austerity, to use apocalyptic language, warning that Ireland would not have access to any alternative funding if next month's fiscal treaty is rejected. The real question is whether Ireland's \u2013 or Europe's \u2013 voters, after years of pain, still have the stomach for this message.",

All the reforms we are putting in place now are deflationary,\" he said.</p> <p>Last Thursday, the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, said that growth needed to be pushed to the front of the debate, although he later cautioned: \"There are no magic formulas.\" He was responding to the European Central Bank's Mario Draghi, who on Wednesday told the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee that a fiscal compact needed to be followed by a \"growth compact\".</p> <p>It is a debate that has been accompanied by loud and febrile commentary from economists and analysts in the media, who have become emboldened to declare Europe's much-heralded bailout, less than two months old, stillborn.</p> <p>In the <em>New York Times</em> last week, Nobel prizewinning economist Paul Krugman \u2013 long at the forefront of criticising austerity measures \u2013 denounced the failed \"zombie economic policies\" of Europe's (and America's) \"austerians\".</p> <p>In the <em>Financial Times,</em> Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Torreblanca, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, reflecting a growing view even within the conservative Spanish administration of Mariano Rajoy, whose government's credit rating was on Friday downgraded a second time, announced: \"Time to say 'basta' to the nonsense of austerity.\"</p> <p>None of which is what Germany and its chancellor, Angela Merkel, want to hear before a key vote in May in the German parliament that would not only approve the fiscal compact, but even more importantly, the European Stability Mechanism \u2013 the region's new emergency bailout fund. Other events on the horizon include elections in Greece and the French legislative elections in June, all of which threaten to turn a growing anti-austerity moment, underpinned by rising populism, into a major crisis.</p> <p>If there is one place, however, where the anti-austerity backlash is not being felt, it is in Germany, where the prescription from politicians and central bankers for Europe's problem cases remains largely unchanged. It was reiterated in comments to the <em>New York Times</em> last week by Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank and formerly a top adviser to Merkel, who warned that agreements previously made must be respected, even at the loss of some \"national sovereignty\". Ulrike Gu\u00e9rot, a colleague of Torreblanca and senior research fellow and representative for Germany on the European Council on Foreign Relations, explains: \"It is different for the German government. It can still withstand the wider sense of political crisis because there is no unemployment at 50%, as there is in Spain, and no rising political populism.\"</p> <p>Despite that, she believes that outside Germany \"a game change is coming\" that Merkel will not be able to ignore. While Gu\u00e9rot believes that the rapid change in the tone of the debate may cause a moment of political crisis for Europe, she also argues that the imminent ending of \"Merkozy\" \u2013 the lockstep relationship between France and Germany embodied in Merkel and Sarkozy that has driven European economic and political policy \u2013 may be a good thing. \"What is happening is serious. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande seems to be emerging as a leader of a pan-European anti-austerity movement.\"</p> <p>Gu\u00e9rot believes that the \"symbiotic relationship\" of Sarkozy and Merkel as the driving engine for EU policy may have contributed in large measure to the feeling by many countries and electorates that they were being excluded from the debate. \"There is an advantage to the end of the Merkel-Sarkozy relationship in that it will open up room for new disputes, new ideas and new debate.\" Not least, she adds, over a necessary realignment in the relationship between democracy in the EU and the influence of the markets. \"We are not talking growth versus austerity. The debate is over what kind of growth we need.\" And, she adds, over whether the targets in the fiscal compact are too tight. \"We can't just save. We need to invest. The world isn't going to end if the 3% target is missed by a few points next year.\"</p> <p>While some argue that a full-blown political crisis in Europe that leads to a rejection of the German-led austerity measures might force a crisis in Germany over Europe, Gu\u00e9rot believes that the most likely outcome is a renegotiation. \"Merkel is a survivor and pragmatic. And I think Hollande knows that he will need an accommodation, too. If this fiscal compact falls \u2013 if there is a second version \u2013 it will have to be faced.\"</p> <p>While analysts such as Gu\u00e9rot might be relaxed about such an outcome, for those politicians at the heart of the growing storm the stakes could not be higher. On Friday, in Dublin, it was the turn of Ireland's deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore, whose Labour party has been crucified in opinion polls for its support for austerity, to use apocalyptic language, warning that Ireland would not have access to any alternative funding if next month's fiscal treaty is rejected.</p> <p>The real question is whether Ireland's \u2013 or Europe's \u2013 voters, after years of pain, still have the stomach for this message.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne and David Cameron made little effort to hide their discomfort at last week's news that the economy had slipped back into recession. Their carefully conceived political arc \u2013 take the pain, restore growth, sail serenely back to power \u2013 has been shattered. Analysts embarrassed by getting their forecasts wrong rubbished the official estimate that GDP declined by 0.2% in the first quarter. But a couple of tenths of a percentage point either way would make no difference to the big picture, which is of an economy flat on its back. Output is lower than it was in the third quarter of 2010. Osborne's central economic gambit \u2013 that, by cutting business tax and regulation and convincing the markets he was serious about tackling the deficit, he would clear the way for growth \u2013 has failed miserably. And perhaps it's no coincidence that just as his economic strategy is so publicly collapsing, the chancellor's deft touch for political strategy appears to have deserted him. The backlash against March's budget has been the most painful and drawn out since Gordon Brown used his last outing with the red box to abolish the 10p tax rate for low earners, leaving a ticking time bomb for Alistair Darling. Osborne isn't being helped either by the fact that the intellectual and political tide across much of Europe seems to be running against him. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's strong showing in the first round of the French presidential election underlines the fact that voters are no longer willing to submit unquestioningly to the markets' demand for austerity. Meanwhile, the surprise collapse of the Dutch government \u2013 one of the most hardline in calling for budgetary discipline elsewhere \u2013 reveals how concerned politicians of many hues are becoming about the social costs of Europe's draconian \"fiscal compact\". But for the chancellor to protest that he has made the UK a \"safe haven\" from the euro storm \u2013 effectively, that it's only thanks to him we're not Greece \u2013 is a cheap get-out. Unlike the single currency's hapless members, the UK has its own central bank and its own currency. That has allowed the pound to fall sharply against the euro and the dollar since the onset of the crisis (though it has appreciated in recent months), and the Bank of England to slash interest rates to 0.5% and pump \u00a3325bn into the economy. A more instructive comparison is the one Ed Balls has gleefully been making for the past 12 months \u2013 with the performance of the US. Admittedly, America's failure to make inroads into its debt has been as much a product of political paralysis in Washington as a thought-through strategy. But over the past three years, President Obama has been unabashed about keeping the spending taps open, and it seems to have paid off. Despite being downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's, and suffering a far worse housing crash than the UK, the US has returned to growth. While GDP in the UK remains more than 4% below its pre-crisis peak, in the US it's more than 1% higher. Of course, there are other secrets to US success: it has a more diversified economy than the UK, where \"business and financial services\" \u2013 the City, plus our armies of accountants, lawyers and consultants \u2013 make up 29% of GDP, against less than 20% in the US. But America is wrestling with many of the same structural difficulties as the UK, such as over-leveraged consumers and banks. So fiscal stimulus may not be the whole answer, but there does seem to be a prima facie case that it helps. As Trevor Greetham of Fidelity says, when comparing the two countries' fortunes, \"growing your way out of debt looks like the better strategy\". Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, certainly thinks so. Warning at his press conference last week about the risk to the economy from what has become known as the \"fiscal cliff\" in 2013 \u2013 when a series of tax allowances runs out at the same time as savage automatic spending cuts kick in \u2013 he said that the Fed, which has been aggressive in propping up growth, would be powerless to help. \"There is absolutely no chance that the Federal Reserve would be able to have the ability whatsoever to offset that effect on the economy,\" he said. As Sir Mervyn King and his colleagues have discovered, central banks can only do so much when the government is sucking demand out of the economy. However, the fact that Osborne's slash and burn approach delivered a knockout blow to an economy that was struggling to get to its feet doesn't mean that a shot of public money will bring Britain back to fighting strength. Most of the sources of growth that powered the expansion of the past 20 years \u2013 consumer credit, property, finance, public services \u2013 are in retreat and likely to remain so, perhaps for years; while exporters, Osborne's great hope, are facing recession and austerity in major markets across the Channel. As Tim Morgan of City broker Tullett Prebon put it in an apocalyptic note last week, \"a substantial majority of the economy has become ex-growth\". It's becoming an increasingly widely held view, in the City and beyond, that without radical action the UK now faces a prolonged period of stagnation. Even within his spending plan, Osborne could have thought urgently about easing the squeeze on hard-pressed families, funding infrastructure projects that would create jobs and boost productive capacity, and channelling investment to firms still starved of the funds to expand. Instead, his priority was to deliver a tax cut to some of the highest earners in the country. For the past two years, the coalition has whined about being left to clear up \"Labour's mess\". But as the economy bumps along the bottom, it's time for Osborne to man up and shoulder his share of the blame.",

As Sir Mervyn King and his colleagues have discovered, central banks can only do so much when the government is sucking demand out of the economy.</p> <p>However, the fact that Osborne's slash and burn approach delivered a knockout blow to an economy that was struggling to get to its feet doesn't mean that a shot of public money will bring Britain back to fighting strength.</p> <p>Most of the sources of growth that powered the expansion of the past 20 years \u2013 consumer credit, property, finance, public services \u2013 are in retreat and likely to remain so, perhaps for years; while exporters, Osborne's great hope, are facing recession and austerity in major markets across the Channel.</p> <p>As Tim Morgan of City broker Tullett Prebon put it in an apocalyptic note last week, \"a substantial majority of the economy has become ex-growth\". It's becoming an increasingly widely held view, in the City and beyond, that without radical action the UK now faces a prolonged period of stagnation.</p> <p>Even within his spending plan, Osborne could have thought urgently about easing the squeeze on hard-pressed families, funding infrastructure projects that would create jobs and boost productive capacity, and channelling investment to firms still starved of the funds to expand. Instead, his priority was to deliver a tax cut to some of the highest earners in the country.</p> <p>For the past two years, the coalition has whined about being left to clear up \"Labour's mess\". But as the economy bumps along the bottom, it's time for Osborne to man up and shoulder his share of the blame.</p>",
