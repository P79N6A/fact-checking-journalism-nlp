      "bodyText": "The contrasting fortunes of rich and poor in the decade since the start of the financial crisis are starkly illustrated by a new report showing the young and those renting homes struggling while the top 1% have now recouped all the ground they lost during the world\u2019s worst post-second world war slump. New research from the Resolution Foundation showed that households with incomes of \u00a3275,000 or more quickly recovered from the impact of the deep recession and have seen their share of national income return to the level seen before the global banking system froze up in the summer of 2007. But while the rich have been thriving, the thinktank said the other 99% of UK households had found it more difficult to make ends meet. It added that the year running up to last month\u2019s general election had seen weaker wage growth, higher inflation and frozen welfare benefits and that these offset any gains from rising employment. Groups that strongly supported Labour in the election \u2013 those aged under 35 who have been frozen out of home ownership by low wages and high prices \u2013 have fared particularly badly. They are the only group that had so far failed to see incomes return to pre-crisis levels. The thinktank said the report highlighted a country increasingly divided by age, by housing tenure and by inequality \u2013 and that all three factors had been important in the shock election result in which Labour gained 30 seats and deprived the Conservatives of an overall majority. The foundation added that the surprise was not that the groups faring badly had turned out \u2013 both in last year\u2019s EU referendum and in the recent general election \u2013 to reject the status quo, but that it had taken them so long to do so. Sterling\u2019s fall since the Brexit vote in June 2016 has pushed up inflation by making imports dearer, but the Resolution Foundation said the current squeeze on living standards for the \u201cjust about managing\u201d previously championed by the prime minister, Theresa May, was a continuation of a longer-term trend. Families on low and middle incomes had seen their living standards rise by just 3% since 2002-03. Once housing costs had been taken into account they were no better off than they were 15 years ago. Two in five said they were unable to afford to save \u00a310 per month, while 42% say they could not afford a week away on holiday at least once a year, up from 37% before the financial crisis. Adam Corlett, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThe incomes of the top 1% took a short, sharp hit following the financial crisis. But they\u2019ve recovered rapidly since and the very richest households have now seen their share of the nation\u2019s income return to very high pre-crisis levels. \u201cIn contrast, for millions of young and lower-income families the current slowdown comes on top of a tough decade for living standards, providing a bleak economic backdrop to the shock election result. \u201cOver the last 15 years and four prime ministers, Britain has failed to deliver decent living standards growth for young families and those on low incomes. Rising housing costs have added further financial pressures. The big surprise of the recent election and EU referendum wasn\u2019t that many of those families turned out to vote against the status quo, but rather why it\u2019s taken so long for that to happen.\u201d The share of national disposable income for the richest 1% of households rose steadily after Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979 and reached a peak of 8.5% on the eve of the financial crisis. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s report showed that after dipping to 7% during the recession that followed, the top 1% again have 8.5% of national income. The thinktank \u2013 which focuses on those on middle and lower incomes \u2013 said Theresa May had been right when she entered No 10 to emphasise the need for the economy to work for the young and those on low pay. However, the foundation\u2019s annual audit of living standards found that real incomes for these groups had fallen over the past year. It said a shortlived boom in the UK in the two years ahead of the 2015 general election won by David Cameron had come to an abrupt end in 2016-17, when real income growth for the typical household income had halved to 0.7% a year. Low and middle-income families fared even worse, with income growth of 0.4%. \u201cThis is the big challenge facing Britain today,\u201d said Corlett. \u201cNot only do we need to get incomes growing again but we need to ensure that growth is spread evenly across the country, across generations and between rich and poor.\u201d Recent evidence had suggested that living standards \u2013 usually a key factor in deciding which way people vote \u2013 were actually falling when the prime minister decided to call the June election. The Resolution Foundation said the disappointing recent performance of the economy meant that the incomes of young families \u2013 those under 35 \u2013 were no higher than they were 15 years ago. The incomes of pensioners \u2013 a group that overwhelmingly voted Conservative last month \u2013 have grown by 30% in real terms over the same period. Britain has had ultra-low interest rates since 2009, but the report said the benefits had gone to those who owned property, not renters. Incomes of those with a mortgage grew by an above-average 1.7% in 2016 while private and social renters experienced income growth of 0.2%. The report said differences between those with mortgage and renters went beyond the security and wealth associated with home ownership and extended to families\u2019 day-to-day living standards. Fast-rising disposable incomes for the top 1% had been the sole driver of rising inequality since the mid-1990s, the Resolution Foundation said. The gap between rich and poor for the other 99% of the population had actually fallen over the same period, it added.",

But fast-forward to 2017 and concerns about Britons\u2019 burgeoning waistlines means the first product launch from Mars in 20 years is only half-covered in chocolate. The strangely named Goodness Knows is being billed as Mars\u2019s biggest product launch in the UK since Celebrations back in 1997, when we were invited to \u201cshare the joy\u201d with mini versions of Twix, Bounty and Snickers united in one box. This time, Mars says Goodness Knows is a treat that comes with \u201cgood intentions\u201d. It is good in the sense that the florentine-like biscuit squares have only the thinnest scraping of dark chocolate and even if you shove all four of them in your mouth at once it will only add up to 160 calories. \u201cBrands are at the heart of what we do, but it\u2019s really, really rare that we launch a new one,\u201d said Mars marketing manager Rebecca Shepheard-Walwyn. In a bid to kickstart sales the confectionery giant will pump nearly \u00a35m into advertising the brand in the first year. UK chocoholics will munch through \u00a36.2bn worth of the sweet stuff this year, but market research group Euromonitor says we are all spending less and it expects total sales to fall back to \u00a35.8bn by 2022. However, at the same time the snack bar market is growing. The recipe for Goodness Knows was honed in development kitchens at the Mars manufacturing plant in Slough, Berkshire, over the last 18 months. It will also be made in Slough, where production lines will churn out 80,000 of the new squares every hour. They will sell for about 90p a pack. A version is already on sale in the US but Mars has had to make it sweeter for UK tastebuds. There is no Mars branding on the new snack pack, while the marketing blurb includes the helpful advice that it can be \u201ceaten all at once, or broken up through the day depending on how you feel\u201d. Shepheard-Walwyn said the product was aimed at modern eating habits. \u201cMost of us are snacking regularly throughout the day on anything from chocolate to an apple. Daily snacking has doubled and people are now spending less than 25 minutes on a single meal.\u201d \u201cConsumers are also increasingly aware of the importance of healthy weight in prevention of diabetes and other diseases, so minimising sugar and calorie intake is high on consumers\u2019 agenda,\u201d said Euromonitor International analyst Wiebke Schoon. \u201cGoodness Knows taps into a lot of current trends,\u201d added Schoon. \u201cMaking fruit and nuts the main ingredients appeals to consumers looking for products with a natural positioning.\u201d Malcolm Clark, of the health group Sustain, said that from a nutritional standpoint Goodness Knows looked fine, but he added: \u201c\u00a34.6m is a massive amount of money to spend on advertising a new product. My worry is that this is another example of food giants like Mars simply trying to create more and more \u2018snacking opportunities\u2019 for consumers that they don\u2019t actually need.\u201d",

In a bid to kickstart sales the confectionery giant will pump nearly \u00a35m into advertising the brand in the first year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/14/tesco-cherry-british-crop-prices-kent-herefordshire\">Tesco takes the cherry as bumper British crop leads to lower prices</a> </p> </aside>  <p>UK chocoholics will munch through \u00a36.2bn worth of the sweet stuff this year, but market research group Euromonitor says we are all spending less and it expects total sales to fall back to \u00a35.8bn by 2022. However, at the same time the snack bar market is growing.</p> <p>The recipe for Goodness Knows was honed in development kitchens at the Mars manufacturing plant in Slough, Berkshire, over the last 18 months. It will also be made in Slough, where production lines will churn out 80,000 of the new squares every hour. They will sell for about 90p a pack. A version is already on sale in the US but Mars has had to make it sweeter for UK tastebuds.</p> <p>There is no Mars branding on the new snack pack, while the marketing blurb includes the helpful advice that it can be \u201ceaten all at once, or broken up through the day depending on how you feel\u201d.</p> <p> Shepheard-Walwyn said the product was aimed at modern eating habits. \u201cMost of us are snacking regularly throughout the day on anything from chocolate to an apple. Daily snacking has doubled and people are now spending less than 25 minutes on a single meal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConsumers are also increasingly aware of the importance of healthy weight in prevention of diabetes and other diseases, so minimising sugar and calorie intake is high on consumers\u2019 agenda,\u201d said Euromonitor International analyst Wiebke Schoon. </p> <p>\u201cGoodness Knows taps into a lot of current trends,\u201d added Schoon. \u201cMaking fruit and nuts the main ingredients appeals to consumers looking for products with a natural positioning.\u201d</p> <p>Malcolm Clark, of the health group Sustain, said that from a nutritional standpoint Goodness Knows looked fine, but he added: \u201c\u00a34.6m is a massive amount of money to spend on advertising a new product. My worry is that this is another example of food giants like Mars simply trying to create more and more \u2018snacking opportunities\u2019 for consumers that they don\u2019t actually need.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Before closing up, let\u2019s take a look at the markets. Wall Street is up in early trading, as weaker data appeared to dampen the chances of further rate rises this year: Dow Jones: +0.1% at 21,566 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,453 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 5,815 The picture in Europe is more mixed: FTSE 100: -0.3% at 7,392 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 12,615 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,233 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 21,457 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,665 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 387 The pound is still going (relatively) strong, up 1% against the dollar at $1.3058. Sterling is up 0.6% against the dollar at \u20ac1.1406. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all the comments and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. AM Before we take a look at Wall Street, the Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith brings us this report on Cyprus: It is not just Greece that is enjoying a bumper tourism season this year. Cyprus\u2019 national statistics office announced today that revenues from tourism have risen considerably, enabling the island to bounce back from its economic crisis. Tourism revenues grew by 25% between January and April, Cystat, said. The data agency attributed the increase to an annual 4.6% rise in average daily spending per person to \u20ac75.23. Brits, who comprise nearly half of the 3.2 million annual tourists who visit Cyprus, shortened their average length of stay by 0.2 days to 9.7 days in April, but their increased spending more than made up for the time lost, according to the service. Greece - which is braced for an unprecedented 30 million foreign visitors this year - and Cyprus have both benefited from tourists staying away from Turkey and Egypt because of security concerns. Falling food and petrol prices contributed to the drop in the annual rate of US inflation, to 1.6% in June from 1.9% in May. The Labor Department figures showed that core inflation \u2013 stripping out food and energy - was unchanged at 1.7% in June. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, is still expecting the Fed to raise rates in the second half of this year: With its dual mandate, the Fed needs to take into account the decline in the unemployment rate this year as well as the drop back in core inflation. For that reason, we still expect the Fed to continue raising interest rates in the second half of this year. Nevertheless, the odds of a September rate hike are fading. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, says the weak inflation and retail sales figures will make the Fed waver even more when considering its next policy move. US inflation and retail sales came in on the softer side of expectations, reinforcing the view in the market\u2019s mind that the Fed won\u2019t carry through with the four rate hikes they are currently forecasting before end 2018. The market is pricing in just one and a half hikes. We still look for three \u2013 one more this year along with a formal start to balance sheet reduction with two more hikes in 2018. Our reasoning is that inflation is likely be back above 2% in the fourth quarter while GDP looks set to grow by around 3% in the second quarter. The dollar is down against the yen and the euro (as well as the pound). The US currency is at a near two-week low of 112.33 yen, down 0.8% after the weak inflation and retail sales figures. The euro is up 0.5% against the dollar at $1.1459. The dollar\u2019s loss from the weak US data is the pound\u2019s gain... The pound is up 0.5% at $1.2996, within touching distance of that $1.30 mark. US consumer price inflation has fallen more sharply than expected, to 1.6% in June from 1.9% in May. Consumer spending was also weaker than expected, with a surprise 0.2% fall in retail sales in June, versus expectations of a 0.1% rise. More soon... Craig Erlam, analyst at currency trader Oanda, says markets are subdued ahead of the US inflation and retail sales data, due at 13.30, as investors wait for clues on the next move from the Fed. It\u2019s been a sluggish start to trading on Friday as traders await inflation and consumer spending numbers from the US that could add a further dovish layer to Janet Yellen\u2019s comments on Wednesday. It\u2019s become very clear in recent weeks that an increasing number of Federal Reserve policymakers are becoming concerned about persistent subdued inflation despite evidence suggesting that the labour market is tightening, typically a trigger for stronger wage growth and higher prices. While headline consumer price inflation is expected to fall to 1.7% in June, from 1.9% in May, core CPI is seen unchanged also at 1.7%. This isn\u2019t going to put policy makers fears at ease at all. The pound is up against both the dollar and the euro. It hit an 11-day high against the dollar, at $1.2984, up 0.3%. Sterling is up 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1365. JP Morgan Chase has kicked off the US banks reporting season for the second quarter with better than expected results. The biggest US bank by assets reported a 13.4% increase in quarterly profits, as gains from higher interest rates offset a drop in bond trading. Net income rose to $7.03bn in the second quarter ended 30 June, from $6.2bn a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to $1.82 from $1.55, beating analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue of $26.4bn was also better than expected. Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive, commented on the figures: We continued to post very solid results against a stable-to- improving global economic backdrop. The US consumer remains healthy, evidenced in our strong underlying performance in consumer and community banking. Loans and deposits continue to grow strongly, and card sales and merchant processing volumes were up double digits. We are also pleased to announce increases to our capital return plans while continuing to invest in our businesses for long-term profitability \u2013 reflecting the financial strength of our company and the significant capital and liquidity improvements we have made over the past several years. Citigroup and Wells Fargo are also expected to report today. Roughly 1.5m new cars were sold in Europe in June, 2.1% more than the same month last year and the highest number since June 2007, just before the global crisis struck a blow to the industry. The figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association show that the wider European market is outperforming the UK, where new car sales fell for a third month in June. Volkswagen is the most popular brand in Europe. Here is the car sales performance in the top five European economies in June: Italy: +12.9% Spain: +6.5% France: +1.6% Germany: -3.5% UK: -4.8% Over the first half of 2017, new car sales in Europe rose 4.7% to more than 8 million: Italy: +8.9% Spain: +7.1% Germany: +3.1% France: +3% UK: -1.3% Eurozone trade was in good shape in May, with the goods surplus rising to \u20ac21.4bn from \u20ac17.9bn in April. The single currency bloc exported \u20ac189.6bn of goods in May, a 12.9% increase on the same month last year. Imports from the rest of the world also rose, by 16.4% to \u20ac168.1bn according to the official figures from Eurostat. Over the first five months of 2017, exports were 8.5% higher than the same period a year ago, at trade \u20ac898.5bn, while imports were up 12.3% at trade \u20ac815.6bn . Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the strong trade figures were good news for the wider eurozone economy. The widening of the euro-zone\u2019s trade surplus in May adds to signs that GDP growth may have accelerated in the second quarter. And in contrast to the situation last year, we expect net trade to boost euro-zone GDP growth in the quarters ahead. Analysts at TS Lombard said Chinese leaders will be hoping to settle differences at this weekend\u2019s National Financial Work Conference: This year\u2019s meeting has attracted particular attention after Xi Jinping is said to have demanded better regulatory coordination following the July 2015 stock market correction and large-scale capital outflows in H2/15. There had been discussion of moving the meeting up to summer 2016 \u2013 half a year ahead of schedule. In the end, however, the meeting, which should have been held in January, has ended up being delayed by disagreements about how to approach regulation. These disagreements have centred around a potential restructuring of the regulatory system. The final decision has not been made, but reports are that a new People\u2019s Bank of China-led office will be established with representatives from other regulators and key government bodies such as the Ministry of Finance and the Development and Reform Commission. The sale of government shares in bailed out bank Royal Bank of Scotland was \u201cvalue for money\u201d despite losses for the taxpayer of nearly \u00a32bn. That\u2019s the verdict of the public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, which has published a report on the controversial sale of a 5.4% two years ago. The NAO concluded the sale was \u201cwell planned and organised and represented value for money\u201d. The Press Association reports: The sale came under heavy criticism at the time after the Government offloaded its first tranche of shares in RBS at a 52-week low. There was also speculation over leaked information after shares plunged 8% in the three days before the sale as hedge funds bet against RBS. It was originally estimated that the 2015 share sale saw losses of \u00a31.1 billion on the price paid under the \u00a345.5 billion bailout of RBS at the height of the financial crisis. But the NAO said, taking into account costs of financing the rescue, losses on the stake sale soared to \u00a31.9 billion. It comes a day after RBS was ordered to pay $5.5bn (\u00a34.2bn) to US regulators for misselling toxic mortgage bonds: John Lewis says consumers are increasingly unwilling to spend money on big ticket items as confidence wanes and incomes are squeezed by higher prices and weak wage growth. Paula Nickolds, the new chief executive of Britain\u2019s biggest department store, said demand had dropped for the larger, non essential purchases. However the \u2018lipstick effect\u2019 appears to have kicked in, where cash-strapped consumers are more willing to buy less costly luxurious goods, instead of that new TV or piece of furniture. Nickolds told journalists at a press dinner: It\u2019s the more considered categories, the arguably deferrable spend, that we\u2019re seeing most affected by the uncertainty in the macro conditions - so those big ticket categories are currently trading just behind last year. \u201cWe believe [spontaneous categories such as beauty] to be significantly ahead of the market. Perhaps it\u2019s the lipstick effect as we might have called it back in the recession [of 2008].\u201d Acknowledging the challenging consumer backdrop, Nickolds said: I would have preferred to start my first year as managing director of John Lewis in slightly more benign conditions. The backdrop is very uncertain and it was made worse by the tragic events that happened across British cities over the last few months. Consumers feel uncertain and worried about what the circumstances will mean for their future financial prosperity. Some respite for Carillion this morning with shares up 4.6% at 60p, making the building group the top riser on the FTSE 250. After heavy losses every day this week, shares have been boosted by the news that the troubled company has appointed HSBC as its joint financial adviser and joint corporate broker. Analysts at investment bank Jefferies warned earlier this week that Carillion was unlikely to survive without a hefty rights issue of at least \u00a3500m. Carillion is a major contractor to customers such as the Highways Agency and Network Rail and investors panicked on Monday when it revealed an \u00a3845m writedown against customer payments it no longer expected to be able to collect. At the same time it announced chief executive Richard Howson had immediately stepped down. Over subsequent days 70% of its market value was wiped out as shares plummeted. Shares were worth 200p a month ago. A reminder of how events unfolded: European markets are steady in early trading, with only small moves. FTSE 100: -0.03% at 7,411 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 12,633 France\u2019s CAC: +0.03% at 5,237 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.03% at 21,516 Spain\u2019s Ibex: +0.04% at 10,663 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.03% at 386 China\u2019s leaders gather every five years to discuss ways to improve the financial system of the world\u2019s second largest economy. The next meeting of the National Financial Work Conference takes place today and tomorrow in Beijing and President Xi Jinping is expected to attend. Items on the agenda are likely to include reining in financial risk, and giving the central bank a bigger role in overseeing other financial regulators. Some background on the history of the meeting from Bloomberg: The meeting has held a special place in China\u2019s economic and political calendar since it was introduced to encourage more sustainable economic growth following the Asian financial crisis. The first conference in 1997 saw the establishment of an insurance regulator and a plan to bail out China\u2019s largest banks. The second led to the creation of a banking regulator and a drive to list major state-owned lenders on overseas stock exchanges. The 2007 conference oversaw the creation of the sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp., which now has $813.5 billion of assets. The meeting in 2012 focused on the fallout from the global financial crisis. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European markets are expected to follow Wall Street higher this morning as investors continue to digest the more cautious tone from Fed chair Janet Yellen. A rate hike in September is no longer looking like a foregone conclusion after Yellen highlighted weak inflation as a factor weighing on the minds of policymakers. Michael Hewson from CMC Markets explains: The Dow Jones posted another record close, while the US dollar remained under pressure as markets adjusted to how the next moves on monetary policy might play out. The prospect that further interest rate rises may well be much more gradual, if they happen at all, shouldn\u2019t have been entirely unexpected given the risks involved in trying to withdraw stimulus and raise rates at the same time, nonetheless judging by the market reaction it appears to have gone down fairly well. With that in mind, investors will be focused on the latest US inflation data, due at 13.30 UK time. It is expected to show consumer price inflation fell to 1.7% in June from 1.9% in May. US retail sales data for June will also be published at 13.30, and are expected to show the sector managed growth of just 0.1% last month, following a 0.3% drop in sales in May.

Tesco has announced it will take excess produce from its suppliers, in line with an existing agreement, and begin selling large 1kg trays of cherries at a lower price per unit than usual. \u201cWe want to support our British farmers and stop any cherries from going to waste on farms. So, to help our homegrown suppliers, Tesco has bought an extra 80 tonnes per week of British cherries to help growers use the bumper crop of fruit created,\u201d the firm said. It will sell the 1kg trays for \u00a34 each, significantly less per unit than the \u00a310 per kg rate of its usual 200g punnets and the usual \u00a37.50 per kg rate of its 400g ones.

Tesco said it has an agreement with suppliers to take crops from them throughout the year, meaning it is obliged to increase its orders when there is a bumper harvest.

Vernon Mascarenhas, sales director of the wholesaler First Choice, said that, in his experience, prices had remained stable from last year, meaning that wholesalers were able to benefit from increased orders. He said that technological advancements and improvements in agricultural techniques had made British cherries cheaper and easier to harvest in recent years, adding: \u201cThe demand from the restaurants I supply, every year, it gets higher.\u201d He said that cherry prices had not risen in line with other fruits, meaning that wholesalers were \u201cturning over more money\u201d with increased orders, but not necessarily making more profits.",

      "bodyText": "It was one of George Osborne\u2019s most effective soundbites. Before, during and after the 2010 general election, the man who served as David Cameron\u2019s chancellor for six years blamed his austerity measures on Labour\u2019s failure to \u201cfix the roof while the sun was shining\u201d. What goes around comes around. The Office for Budget Responsibility was set up by Osborne in 2010 to keep tabs on the state of the public finances free from the clutches of politicians and has now published its first report into the long-term fiscal risks facing Britain. Its message was brutally simple. The UK has had a recession once in every decade since the 1970s and there is a 50% chance of there being another one in the next five years. Recessions play havoc with the public finances: three of those since the 1970s have seen the budget deficit \u2013 the difference between what the government spends and its income in any one year \u2013 rise to 6% or more. \u201cGiven their near inevitability, but unpredictable timing, there is little policymakers can do in advance beyond recognising that they will need to accept their fiscal costs at some point in the future,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis is one reason why academic research and International Monetary Fund advice says that governments should aim to create fiscal space in normal times.\u201d Creating fiscal space in normal times is just a posh way of saying governments should fix the roof while the sun is shining. So how is the repair job going? Well, the good news is that the deficit is now running at only a quarter of its 10% peak. The bad news is that the ratio of national debt to national income \u2013 the accumulation of all the deficits racked up down the years \u2013 has doubled since the start of the crisis. The roof has not been fixed at a time when both short-term and long-term pressures are building. In the short term, Theresa May\u2019s government eased up on the deficit reduction plan inherited from Cameron and saw the result of the election as evidence of \u201causterity\u201d fatigue. The cost of the overnment\u2019s survival \u2013 a \u00a31bn package of financial support for Northern Ireland \u2013 has led to demands for higher spending in other areas, most notably public sector pay. Longer term, the population is getting older, which means that health care costs are inevitably going to rise. That needs to be taken into account when the government is making its fiscal plans. So does the impact of Brexit. While the OBR\u2019s report was careful to make no assessment of the cost of leaving the EU, it did stress how sensitive the public finances were to even quite modest changes in the economy\u2019s long-term economic performance. Should the economy\u2019s long-term trend growth rate fall by 0.1 percentage point as a result of weaker trade and investment following departure from the EU, there would be a slow-burn effect on the public finances. Over 50 years, the cumulative impact of weaker growth and lower tax receipts would lead to the debt to GDP ratio being 50 percentage points higher. Even before Brexit, the OBR had been forced to reassess some of its key assumptions by virtue of the economy\u2019s failure to bounce back from the financial crisis and the deep slump of 2007-09. For many years it kept predicting that productivity growth would recover to its long-term trend of 2.2%. But this estimate was cut twice in 2016 \u2013 first to 2% and then to 1.8%. It is always tempting, the OBR notes, for a government to indulge in a few tax and spending giveaways on the basis that the money will be clawed back by takeaways tomorrow. \u201cThe risk there, of course, is that tomorrow never comes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "EasyJet is to open a new European headquarters in Austria to enable it to continue to operate flights within the EU after Brexit. The airline said it intended to establish a new airline, easyJet Europe, which would be headquartered in Vienna. The carrier has been searching for a new operating licence from an EU country while uncertainty hangs over its business. Without the Austrian licence, easyJet would be unable to continue flights between other EU countries. The restructuring of the business, which will involve the re-registering of 110 aircraft under Austrian jurisdiction, is expected to cost at least \u00a310m \u2013 although the overall costs of Brexit to the airline have run much higher, with currency devaluation alone hitting profits by \u00a388m in 2016 and \u00a382m in the first half of this year. EasyJet still faces legal uncertainty over whether it will be able to fly between the UK and Europe, and on what terms, after Brexit. Ryanair repeated its warnings to the European parliament this week that there was a real prospect of no flights operating between the EU and UK for a period in 2019. EasyJet said it was continuing to push for negotiators \u201cto reach an aviation agreement which at a minimum will enable flights between the UK and EU\u201d. The company said the Vienna move would make it a pan-European aviation group \u2013 with three airlines based in Austria, Switzerland and the UK \u2013 that would be controlled by easyJet plc, which would remain listed on the London Stock Exchange. EasyJet, which employs 4,000 staff in continental Europe, said the move would not affect UK jobs \u2013 its 6,000 employees in Britain would continue to be based in Luton and its 11 other bases across the country.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A third of Burberry\u2019s shareholders have failed to back the luxury brand\u2019s remuneration report in a protest over high pay. Investors representing just over 32% of voting shares rejected the report with more investors withholding their votes despite recent attempts to appease their anger by reducing overall pay deals. The rebellion was the biggest since 2014, when more than half of shareholders voted against director pay at the British fashion house. At Burberry\u2019s annual meeting in central London on Thursday morning, the chairman, John Peace, defended the pay packages for key executives including Christopher Bailey, who was joint chief creative director and chief executive until last week, and the new chief operating officer and finance officer, Julie Brown. Bailey\u2019s total remuneration last year rose from \u00a31.9m to \u00a33.5m. While he waived his entitlement to any annual bonus for the year, his total was boosted by a \u00a31.4m payout from an award of shares from a 2014 plan. This month he will also receive shares worth \u00a310.5m \u2013 600,000 of the 1m shares he was awarded in 2013, when the company was concerned that he might be poached by a rival. Brown, who joined from medical supplies group Smith &amp; Nephew, was paid \u00a34.7m between January and March 2017, including a golden hello of \u00a34.5m consisting of \u00a34m in shares and \u00a3550,000 in cash. However, she handed back \u00a30.8m of those shares and a further \u00a31.6m of additional share awards after complaints from shareholder advisory groups. Peace, who has signalled he will step down by the end of next year, said after the AGM: \u201cMy job is to work with the board and remuneration committee to do what\u2019s right for the longer term. My job is to get the best we can for the company and I think in Julie we have an absolute star.\u201d Fabiola Arredondo, the former Yahoo executive, who now heads Burberry\u2019s remuneration committee, said that since she took over in August last year the committee had been actively engaging with shareholders and addressing concerns. The row over pay came as shareholders got their first chance to meet Marco Gobbetti, who last week took over from Bailey as chief executive. Bailey will now focus on his creative role under the title of president. The new appointment followed pressure from shareholders concerned that Bailey was struggling to handle his dual role in a luxury goods market faced with slowing sales across key markets such as China and the Middle East. Speaking after the meeting, Gobbetti said both he and Bailey were used to working in partnership. \u201cChristopher is one of the reasons I came to this company. We have the same vision and same values,\u201d he said. Bailey told shareholders the partnership would let him \u201credouble my focus on design and creating experiences that will energise the brand\u201d. Gobbetti said he would spend time talking to shareholders, customers and people inside the business around the world, particular outside Asia, where he has been working for Burberry since January due to restrictions under his contract with former employer, the French brand C\u00e9line. Gobbetti also reiterated Burberry\u2019s commitment to manufacturing in Leeds and said that dropping the option on developing the listed Temple Mill building, as revealed on Wednesday, simply meant dropping one option for the project. \u201cThere are others,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 July 2017 to clarify how much Julie Brown handed back after complaints from shareholder advisory groups.",
