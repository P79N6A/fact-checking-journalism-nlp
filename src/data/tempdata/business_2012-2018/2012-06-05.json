The Lloyds data shows broad based declines in an index which measures economic prospects, trading prospects, employment prospects and profit margins across all sectors and regions, with the most notable declines in the North and Midlands and in the retail and distribution sectors. Nevertheless, overall sentiment remains better than at the time of the 2008/09 financial crisis and ahead of pre-Christmas 2011 levels.

      "bodyText": "Their wardrobes are packed with haute couture and designer accessories but for the world's super-rich shopping is no longer enough: lavish one-of-a-kind travel adventures are the latest status symbol. Helicopter skiing in Alaska or a getaway to luxury goods group LVMH's exclusive hideaway in the Maldives are the current trends for the growing number of millionaires, according to a report. It predicts that, despite the eurozone crisis, spending on luxury goods will hit $1.5tn (\u00a3975bn) this year as the wealthy look for novel ways to spend their riches. The study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) identifies a shift from \"owning a luxury to experiencing a luxury\" with bespoke treats now accounting for more than half of the $1.4tn spent on luxury goods and services last year. Luxury sales have boomed in the last two years as the industry recovered from the hiatus caused by 2008 global financial crisis, which provoked a sharp fall in conspicuous consumption. The sector has also been buoyed by the growing number of millionaire shoppers in markets such as China and Brazil, who are picking up the slack as consumers in traditionally important luxury markets such as western Europe, Japan and the US continue to spend more cautiously. \"The gap in income inequality is growing, which is unfortunate, but there are more and more millionaires every year,\" said Jean-Marc Bellaiche, a BCG senior partner who heads the firm's luxury practice.

But rates are still expected to fall soon. \"We doubt that the ECB will cut interest rates as soon as their June policy meeting on Wednesday \u2013 although it is not inconceivable given the Eurozone's heightened economic and sovereign debt problems \u2013 but we do now think it is highly likely that the ECB will cut interest rates to 0.75% in the third quarter,\" said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, added to the pressure on the ECB by saying it has room to cut rates. With Spanish bond yields close to the \"danger zone\", and Italy not far behind, the ECB is also facing calls to start buying both country's debt in the bond markets again. European stock markets experienced a mixed day on Tuesday. France's CAC index ended 1% higher, but Germany's DAX closed down 8 points at 5969, and the main Athens index fell more than 5% to a fresh 22-year low. European markets will remain highly nervous until the deadlock over Spain's banking crisis is resolved. Madrid's government continues to resist pressure to seek a bailout, but many analysts believe its resolve must crack. Germany's governing Christian Democrats, and the opposition Social Democrats, are both adamant that EU rules cannot be bent for Spain. Volker Kauder, the CDU's parliamentary leader in Berlin, said financial aid for Spain must be requested by the government itself. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, former German foreign minister and current SPD parliamentary leader, took a stronger line, saying there was a risk that Spain could run out of time. \"I see a risk that Spain will be too late in deciding to seek protection from the euro rescue umbrella,\" Steinmeier said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Finance ministers from the developed world have thrown their weight behind moves towards greater \"fiscal and financial union\" in the eurozone as the best way to tackle the debt crisis threatening to destroy the single currency. The British chancellor, George Osborne, and other finance ministers from the G7 group of industrialised nations and central bankers discussed the growing pressure on Europe in a telephone conference on Tuesday. British officials described it as a \"stocktaking session\" in advance of the G20 summit in Mexico on 18-19 June. David Cameron flies to Berlin later this week for talks, and will tell the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that Britain will support greater fiscal governance in the eurozone. Finance ministers, fearful that the crisis could derail the global economy, are keen to find swift solutions as the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, warned that his country faces \"extreme difficulty\". Earlier Rajoy's treasury minister, Crist\u00f3bal Montoro, admitted that Spain was effectively shut out of the bond market, unable to raise cash because of the high interest rates demanded by investors. G7 finance ministers made clear that the EU's ongoing crisis will dominate the G20 summit. Michael Froman, a senior economic adviser to the US president, Barack Obama, said: \"The eurozone crisis is the most significant threat to growth.\" The prime minister discussed the eurozone crisis in a phone call with Obama on Tuesday night. The call was one of a series the president is holding with world leaders before the G20 summit. The White House said Obama also used the call to commend Britain for the special forces raid in Afghanistan over the weekend which freed four hostages. A statement issued by the US treasury, which currently chairs the finance chiefs' group, said: \"The G7 ministers and governors reviewed developments in the global economy and financial markets and the policy response under consideration, including the progress towards financial and fiscal union in Europe. They agreed to monitor developments closely ahead of the G20 summit in Los Cabos [in Mexico].\" The statement was issued after the Guardian reported that European leaders were drawing up a blueprint for what is described as a federalised eurozone. The new French government and the European commission have voiced strong support for a new eurozone \"banking union\" to save the single currency, but the French may balk at having to surrender sovereignty over their budgets and fiscal policies. The EU's four key players \u2013 the European council president, the European commission president, the president of the European Central Bank and the head of the 17-strong eurozone finance ministers \u2013 are due to present proposals to an EU summit at the end of the month. Cameron will tell Merkel in Berlin Britain would welcome moves towards fiscal governance in the eurozone. Downing Street believes survival of the euro is vital to the British national interest and a single currency can only succeed if it co-ordinates monetary and fiscal policy. But the UK will not be writing any blank cheques, as Cameron showed when he vetoed a proposed amendment to the Lisbon treaty last December that would have embedded the new eurozone fiscal compact within the architecture of the EU. This meant France and Germany had to take the lead in drawing up a parallel treaty. The prime minister may find himself in the slightly curious position of encouraging Merkel to take steps towards greater pooling of eurozone sovereignty that she currently finds unacceptable. Cameron believes, for example, the eurozone should give serious consideration to eurobonds \u2013 jointly issued bonds which would enable debt-laden countries to benefit from the strong financial position, and lower borrowing costs, of Germany. Britain does not currently detect any moves in Berlin towards accepting eurobonds. Ministers do, however, detect interest in Berlin to using the European financial stability facility to support European banks. That would involve the eurozone countries jointly guaranteeing savers' bank deposits. One British official said: \"The German position is evolving. It is not shifting dramatically.\" Finance ministers were keen to touch base ahead of the G20 summit after the recent weak job figures in the US and the poor growth figures in China. Rajoy told the Spanish senate Europe must underline the \"irreversibility\" of the euro by agreeing a common banking union and backing eurozone bonds. Montoro and Rajoy are determined to avoid a full-scale bailout, because of the tough conditions that would be attached to the funds, but want the eurozone to inject cash into its banks \u2013 not allowed under current rules. However, Jeremy Cook of foreign currency trading group World First, said Spain should apply for a formal bailout: \"Although politically destructive and obviously humiliating, it is time for Spain to ask for help from the IMF.\" Economists at US bank JP Morgan estimated on Tuesday that Spain might require a bailout of \u20ac350bn (\u00a3283bn), of which \u20ac75bn needs to be pumped into its struggling banking sector.",

Lloyd's Register (LR) could be a cheerleader for foreign secretary William Hague's exhortations \"to win our place in the world economy\" \u2013 except that chief executive, Richard Sadler, is strongly critical of Westminster policies. \"The government needs a long-term plan to protect the supply chain, whether we are talking about food or energy. If [shipping and oil capacity] is all in the hands of foreign governments we should not be surprised if they protect their own first if the need arrives,\" he argues. \"We are not looking ahead and taking an integrated approach like in China and Germany and that is poor policy.

And it has no hesitation investing in new university-based technology centres, whether in Singapore or Southampton as well as handing out cash to run lifeboats through the RNLI. But there is little doubt where home is, given LR was a product of the same Lombard Street coffee shop as another famous maritime name, the Lloyd's insurance market. The two organisations were once one, and continue to provide services for each other but they have no ownership ties any more. LR is also at least 20 times smaller in revenue terms. The company employs fewer than 10,000 staff but has a turnover of nearly \u00a31bn and makes steady returns of 10% on that. About 40% of the revenues still come from roughly the same kind of maritime business that LR started in. It was formed in 1760 to provide third-party safety checks on the fleet of merchant vessels that served the British empire from its base in London docks. But a current slump in shipping \u2013 following the 2008 credit crunch \u2013 and the growth of the energy sector has led to wind farms and oil refineries expanding to 30% of its business.

      "body": "<p>Six internal factors suggest that the US economy is slowly healing. For some observers, these factors were deemed sufficient to form the critical mass needed to propel the economy into escape velocity.</p> <p>While I hoped they might be proven right, the recent stream of weak economic data, including May's timid net job creation of only 69,000, confirmed my doubts. With this and other elements of a disheartening employment report now suddenly raising widespread worries about the underlying health and durability of America's recovery, it is important to understand the positive factors and why they are not enough as yet.</p> <p>For starters, large US multinational companies are as healthy as I have ever seen them. Their cash balances are extremely high, interest payments on debt are low, and principal obligations have been termed out. Many of them are successfully tapping into buoyant demand in emerging economies, generating significant free cash flow.</p> <p>Company cash is not the only source of considerable spending power waiting on the sidelines. Rich households also hold significant resources that could be deployed in support of both consumption and investment.</p> <p>The third and fourth positive factors relate to housing and the labour market. These two long-standing areas of persistent weakness have constituted a major drag on the type of cyclical dynamics that traditionally thrust the US out of its periodic economic slowdowns. But recent data support the view that the housing sector could be in the process of establishing a bottom, albeit an elongated one.

      "bodyText": "Six internal factors suggest that the US economy is slowly healing. For some observers, these factors were deemed sufficient to form the critical mass needed to propel the economy into escape velocity. While I hoped they might be proven right, the recent stream of weak economic data, including May's timid net job creation of only 69,000, confirmed my doubts. With this and other elements of a disheartening employment report now suddenly raising widespread worries about the underlying health and durability of America's recovery, it is important to understand the positive factors and why they are not enough as yet. For starters, large US multinational companies are as healthy as I have ever seen them. Their cash balances are extremely high, interest payments on debt are low, and principal obligations have been termed out. Many of them are successfully tapping into buoyant demand in emerging economies, generating significant free cash flow. Company cash is not the only source of considerable spending power waiting on the sidelines. Rich households also hold significant resources that could be deployed in support of both consumption and investment. The third and fourth positive factors relate to housing and the labour market. These two long-standing areas of persistent weakness have constituted a major drag on the type of cyclical dynamics that traditionally thrust the US out of its periodic economic slowdowns. But recent data support the view that the housing sector could be in the process of establishing a bottom, albeit an elongated one. Meanwhile, job growth, while anaemic, has been consistently positive since September 2010. Then there is the US Federal Reserve Board. Despite legitimate questions about the effectiveness of its unconventional and ever-experimental policy stance, the Fed appears willing to be even more activist if the economy weakens. Indeed, if the Fed makes an inadvertent mistake (the likelihood of this is considerable, given the country's complex situation and the \"unusually uncertain\" outlook), it is more likely to err on the side of staying accommodative for too long, rather than tightening monetary policy prematurely.

Last month the budget carrier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/21/ryanair-fuel-rises-eurozone-crisis?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Ryanair said its profits could fall by up to 20% this year</a>.</p> <p>Despite the setback, Joyce, who has announced 1,000 job cuts, is sticking to the target of returning the international business to profit in 2014. \"We are attacking costs and allocating aircraft and capital efficiently,\" he said, highlighting the withdrawal from loss-making international routes. The world's second-oldest airline is also shrinking its engineering and maintenance centres to save money.</p> <p>Qantas is the market leader in Australia with a share of 65%, but Virgin Australia has recently been going head to head on key domestic business routes. Qantas's woes come as Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways said it had acquired an initial near 4% stake in Virgin Australia. \"We're interested in taking the stake up to a higher level of 10% subject to the necessary regulatory approvals,\" Etihad said, adding that the state-owned airline had \"no interest\" in investing in Qantas.</p>",

The profit warning underlines the global aviation sector's struggles as high oil prices and sagging demand resulting from eurozone turmoil take their toll. The International Air Transport Association has downgraded its forecast for total airline profits in 2012 to $3bn from $3.5bn, and warned the rise in oil prices could lead to losses of as much as $5.3bn. Last month the budget carrier Ryanair said its profits could fall by up to 20% this year. Despite the setback, Joyce, who has announced 1,000 job cuts, is sticking to the target of returning the international business to profit in 2014. \"We are attacking costs and allocating aircraft and capital efficiently,\" he said, highlighting the withdrawal from loss-making international routes. The world's second-oldest airline is also shrinking its engineering and maintenance centres to save money. Qantas is the market leader in Australia with a share of 65%, but Virgin Australia has recently been going head to head on key domestic business routes. Qantas's woes come as Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways said it had acquired an initial near 4% stake in Virgin Australia. \"We're interested in taking the stake up to a higher level of 10% subject to the necessary regulatory approvals,\" Etihad said, adding that the state-owned airline had \"no interest\" in investing in Qantas.",
