      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has admitted his profession is in crisis having failed to foresee the 2008 financial crash and having misjudged the impact of the Brexit vote. Andrew Haldane, said it was \u201ca fair cop\u201d referring to a series of forecasting errors before and after the financial crash which had brought the profession\u2019s reputation into question. Blaming the failure of economic models to cope with \u201cirrational behaviour\u201d in the modern era, the economist said the profession needed to adapt to regain the trust of the public and politicians. Haldane described the collapse of Lehman Brothers as the economics profession\u2019s \u201cMichael Fish moment\u201d (a reference to when the BBC weather forecaster predicted in 1987 that the UK would avoid a hurricane that went on to devastate large parts of southern England). Speaking at the Institute for Government in central London, Haldane said meteorological forecasting had improved markedly following that embarrassing mistake and that the economics profession could follow in its footsteps. The bank has come under intense criticism for predicting a dramatic slowdown in the UK\u2019s fortunes in the event of a vote for Brexit only for the economy to bounce back strongly and remain one of the best performing in the developed world. Haldane is known to be concerned about mounting criticism of experts and the potential for Threadneedle Street\u2019s forecasts to be dismissed by politicians if errors persist. Former Tory ministers, including the former foreign secretary William Hague and the former justice secretary Michael Gove, last year attacked the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, for predicting a dramatic slowdown in growth if the country voted to leave the EU. Prominent Brexit campaigners have also besieged the central bank. Before the vote, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson accused the bank of risking undermining economic confidence by issuing warnings about the potential effects of a vote for Brexit. During her conference speech following the vote, on 6 October, the prime minister, Theresa May, criticised the bank\u2019s reaction to the vote after it cut interest rates further and boosted its package of stimulus measures by \u00a360bn to \u00a3435bn. Gove said last week that when he said experts needed to be challenged, he meant economists in particular. In a debate with Stephanie Flanders, the former BBC economics editor, he cited an academic study to support his argument that expert economists were not good at making predictions. Gove said: \u201cSometimes we\u2019re invited to take experts as though they were prophets, as though their words were carved in tablets of stone and that we had to simply meekly bow down before them and accept their verdict. \u201cI think the right response in a democracy, to assertions made by experts, is to say \u2018show us the evidence, show us the facts\u2019. And then, if experts or indeed anyone in the debate can make a strong case, draw on evidence and let us think again \u2013 then of course they deserve respect.\u201d Flanders, who now works for JP Morgan, agreed that economists had a long record of being wrong on direct forecasts while expressing concerns about the consequences of expertise being dismissed out of hand. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen over the last few years economists and indeed the elite, the technocrats, can be wrong in some pretty big areas,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were wrong in their assumptions about certain financial instruments and developments, which helped contribute to the financial crisis.\u201d Official figures have shown the economy was outstripped only by the US among the large economies last year after growth in the third quarter was upgraded to 0.6%. Forecasts by the Treasury, the International Monetary Fund and the Paris-based OECD, all pointed to a recession after the vote, based on assumptions of steeply declining consumer spending and business investment. Haldane said: \u201cIt\u2019s a fair cop to say the profession is to some degree in crisis. It\u2019s not the first time it has happened. It happened back in the 1930s and [during] the Great Depression. But out of that something good spread. It brought us [John Maynard] Keynes and the birth of modern macro-economics. Out of this crisis, there could be a rebirth of economics. I\u2019m not someone who would say that all that\u2019s been done in the past is terrible. It\u2019s just that the models we had were rather narrow and fragile. The problem came when the world was tipped upside down and those models were ill-equipped to making sense of behaviours that were deeply irrational.\u201d He blamed the profession\u2019s reliance on models that were built for an age when consumers and businesses, and especially banks, \u201cbehaved rationally\u201d. Since 2008, consumers have maintained their spending when the classic economic models would have expected them to be more circumspect. Haldane, who is regularly cited as a dove on the bank\u2019s interest rate-setting committee, has argued that the economy remains weak and that rates should stay low to boost growth. Answering critics of the bank\u2019s gloomy November forecast for the economy, he admitted that the bank did not anticipate the resilience of consumer spending after Britain voted to leave the EU. But he said that he thought the bank was wrong about timing not about the fundamentals, and that the Bank of England still expected Brexit to harm growth. \u201cI think, near-term, the data, the evidence we\u2019ve been accumulating since the referendum, has surprised to the upside. [There\u2019s been] greater resilience, in particular among consumers and among the housing market, than we had expected. Has that led us to fundamentally change our view on the fortunes of the economy looking forward over the next several years? Not really. \u201cThis is more a question, I think, of timing than of a fundamental reassessment of the fortunes of the economy. So back in November we published a forecast for inflation which was the highest we\u2019ve ever published. And the forecast for growth in the UK economy, that was the lowest we have ever published. \u201cWe are still expecting this rather difficult balancing act for monetary policy with a slowing, not a huge slowing, but nonetheless a material slowing, during the course of next year as the effects of higher prices in the shops begin to chew away a little at the spending power of consumers and cause them to rein back a little in their spending. That remains our central view, with huge amounts of uncertainty around it.\u201d He blamed decades of education policies \u2013 that had left numeracy levels in England only just above Albania \u2013 for holding back improvements in productivity. He said the lack of numeracy skills was stark in comparison with other countries, which placed more emphasis on workers having more than a basic level of maths. Haldane said: \u201cI\u2019ll give an example of where Britain is punching well below its weight and that\u2019s in core numeracy skills. There are 17 million people who have levels of numeracy that are no better than those expected of primary age children. In a recent OECD study that looked at numeracy as it applies to financial literacy, the UK came 17th, just above Albania, on questions of financial literacy.\u201d He added that the UK\u2019s lack of numeracy skills across more than half the working population was a key reason for its lack of productivity growth since the financial crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Remember Keith Hellawell\u2019s solemn vow, delivered to TV cameras only last September, that he would stand down if outside shareholders didn\u2019t back him in a year\u2019s time? He spoke more in sorrow than in anger, having seen a 53% vote against his re-election, which was repeated in Thursday\u2019s non-binding poll. He understood investors\u2019 frustrations. Lessons had been learned. He had offered to resign but Mike Ashley had asked him to stay. He would prove his worth over the next 12 months. If outside shareholders still wanted him out next September, he\u2019d go without a quibble. Four months later, Ashley would like Hellawell to ignore everything he said and carry on regardless. In other words, Ashley was so alarmed by Thursday\u2019s result \u2013 which, unsurprisingly, showed outsiders\u2019 views haven\u2019t softened one jot \u2013 that he thinks Hellawell is a dead man walking if he intends to honour his pledge. Thus the solution, in Ashley\u2019s eyes, is to ask Hellawell to renege on his promise. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised. If Ashley, owner of 55% of Sports Direct, really wanted to share his boardroom with a strong and independent chairman who would hold him to account, he would have appointed one years ago. The list of Hellawell\u2019s slip-ups is long. He gave a lamentable performance in front of a committee of MPs in March 2015 when questioned about Sports Direct\u2019s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes\u2019 notice. Hellawell said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator\u2019s report. Would any other chairman of a FTSE 100 company, as Sports Direct was at the time, be so incurious or unprepared? Lack of curiosity seems to be a hallmark. In the Shirebrook fall-out, Hellawell blamed some shortcomings on duff intelligence. \u201cOne of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,\u201d he said. But, come on, the Unite union and the media had been raising the alarm for years. A former chief constable of West Yorkshire could surely have turned over a few stones himself. Or consider Hellawell\u2019s claim to have engaged regularly with shareholders, one of the first duties of a chairman of a public company. Standard Life \u2013 in the vanguard of those calling for Hellawell to go \u2013 said last September that the board\u2019s responses to its inquiries had been \u201cunconvincing or non-existent\u201d. After that record, and after two votes of no confidence by outside shareholders, the only honourable course for Hellawell is to stick to his pledge to quit if he gets a third thumbs-down. Maybe, at the final hour, he\u2019ll summon the courage to say no to Ashley. He would salvage a scrap of dignity if he does, but don\u2019t bet a penny on that outcome. Homes sweet homes for Persimmon \u201cWe expect our gross margin in the second half [of 2016] will have improved further,\u201d said housebuilder Persimmon in its end-of-year update, without stating what the new figure will be. Here\u2019s a guess: the profit margin was 23.8% in the first half of the year so Persimmon may now be converting \u00a31 in every \u00a34 of revenue into gross profit. Few companies run on 25% profit margins and fewer enjoy a return on capital employed of 35.6%, which was Persimmon\u2019s half-time score. One could congratulate the company on running a tight ship but do not be surprised if Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, takes a different line. He has a white paper on housing in the offing and hasn\u2019t been shy in saying life for big housebuilders is too cushy. Build more houses, and build them faster, argues Javid, because current volumes are \u201cnowhere near good enough\u201d. Up to a point, Javid\u2019s frustration is fair. Persimmon sold 599 more homes in 2016 than in 2015, an increase of 4%, which doesn\u2019t obviously suggest it is busting a gut. On the other hand, what weapons does Javid hold? Persimmon says it is building on every plot where it has planning permission and would argue that skilled builders are in short supply (and maybe shorter still post-Brexit). Javid will have enough problems selling his planning reforms to those Tory MPs who detect a policy for more urban sprawl, as opposed to intelligent city regeneration. When the dust settles, one suspects the white paper will hold few terrors for big housebuilders. Persimmon\u2019s shares rose 7%, lifting the whole sector. Life is indeed (too) gentle for the big boys, but it\u2019s hard to argue with the market\u2019s view that it can continue for a while yet.",

If Ashley, owner of 55% of Sports Direct, really wanted to share his boardroom with a strong and independent chairman who would hold him to account, he would have appointed one years ago.</p> <p>The list of Hellawell\u2019s slip-ups is long. He gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/25/sports-direct-backstreet-outfit-mps-parliamentary-inquiry\">a lamentable performance in front of a committee of MPs</a> in March 2015 when questioned about Sports Direct\u2019s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes\u2019 notice. Hellawell said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator\u2019s report. Would any other chairman of a FTSE 100 company, as Sports Direct was at the time, be so incurious or unprepared?</p> <p>Lack of curiosity seems to be a hallmark. In the Shirebrook fall-out, Hellawell blamed some shortcomings on duff intelligence. \u201cOne of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,\u201d he said. But, come on, the Unite union and the media had been raising the alarm for years. A former chief constable of West Yorkshire could surely have turned over a few stones himself.</p> <p>Or consider Hellawell\u2019s claim to have engaged regularly with shareholders, one of the first duties of a chairman of a public company. Standard Life \u2013 in the vanguard of those calling for Hellawell to go \u2013 said last September that the board\u2019s responses to its inquiries had been \u201cunconvincing or non-existent\u201d.</p> <p>After that record, and after two votes of no confidence by outside shareholders, the only honourable course for Hellawell is to stick to his pledge to quit if he gets a third thumbs-down. Maybe, at the final hour, he\u2019ll summon the courage to say no to Ashley. He would salvage a scrap of dignity if he does, but don\u2019t bet a penny on that outcome.</p> <h2>Homes sweet homes for Persimmon</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b9400c9bf47dcfe422f77b0c2919fbf6fafbc9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b9400c9bf47dcfe422f77b0c2919fbf6fafbc9a/0_252_4687_2812/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Persimmon construction site\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Persimmon may now be converting \u00a31 in every \u00a34 of revenue into gross profit</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe expect our gross margin in the second half [of 2016] will have improved further,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/05/london-property-prices-taxes-brexit-vote-savills-persimmon\">said housebuilder Persimmon in its end-of-year update</a>, without stating what the new figure will be. Here\u2019s a guess: the profit margin was 23.8% in the first half of the year so Persimmon may now be converting \u00a31 in every \u00a34 of revenue into gross profit.<br></p> <p>Few companies run on 25% profit margins and fewer enjoy a return on capital employed of 35.6%, which was Persimmon\u2019s half-time score. One could congratulate the company on running a tight ship but do not be surprised if Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, takes a different line. He has a white paper on housing in the offing and hasn\u2019t been shy in saying life for big housebuilders is too cushy. Build more houses, and build them faster, argues Javid, because current volumes are \u201cnowhere near good enough\u201d.</p> <p>Up to a point, Javid\u2019s frustration is fair. Persimmon sold 599 more homes in 2016 than in 2015, an increase of 4%, which doesn\u2019t obviously suggest it is busting a gut. On the other hand, what weapons does Javid hold? Persimmon says it is building on every plot where it has planning permission and would argue that skilled builders are in short supply (and maybe shorter still post-Brexit).</p> <p>Javid will have enough problems selling his planning reforms to those Tory MPs who detect a policy for more urban sprawl, as opposed to intelligent city regeneration. When the dust settles, one suspects the white paper will hold few terrors for big housebuilders. Persimmon\u2019s shares rose 7%, lifting the whole sector. Life is indeed (too) gentle for the big boys, but it\u2019s hard to argue with the market\u2019s view that it can continue for a while yet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump threatened Toyota on Thursday with a \u201cbig border tax\u201d if it didn\u2019t build cars meant for the US within the states, the latest in a series of attacks on car manufacturers and the first time since his election that he has threatened a foreign company. The $1bn plant will be located Guanajuato, a state in central Mexico, not Baja California, as Trump tweeted. Toyota plans to increase capacity at an existing plant in Tijuana, Baja California, that makes Tacoma pickup trucks. Toyota plans to manufacture 200,000 Corollas at the new plant. The Corolla is the second bestselling compact car in the US behind fellow Japanese manufacturer Honda\u2019s Civic. Trump\u2019s latest threat follows a similar one against General Motors over its plans to manufacture compact cars south of the border for US export. Jorge Guajardo, the former Mexican ambassador to China, immediately lit into Trump: \u201cIf you think intentionally wrecking your neighbor\u2019s economy is what\u2019s going to bring peace and stability to US you\u2019re in for a big surprise,\u201d he tweeted. Trump, who was elected on a promise to restore US manufacturing jobs, has spent the week instructing automakers to move their compact car production out of Mexico. On Tuesday he told GM that it too must weigh his opinion favorably against the financial efficiencies offered on foreign soil. \u201cMake in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\u201d Trump tweeted. Last month Trump threatened \u201cretribution\u201d against companies outsourcing factory work to foreign facilities. \u201cThere will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies,\u201d he tweeted, naming car and air conditioner manufacturers in the same series of remarks. In recent weeks, Trump also threatened aerospace firms Boeing and Lockheed-Martin, both of which rely heavily on government contracts for multibillion-dollar revenues. Those threats, also tweeted, shocked shareholders and caused stock prices to plummet. But threatening car companies with taxation has barely caused the market to blink. The US president cannot personally levy taxes; that duty falls to state legislatures and the US House of Representatives, which holds the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d. Trump\u2019s campaign platform heavily criticized companies for moving labor out of the US, but thus far his favored method of dealing with corporations has been rewards via back channels, rather than punishment. Instead of taxing air conditioner company Carrier more for exporting jobs, however, Trump and Indiana governor Mike Pence offered the Indiana-based company $7m in tax breaks to keep 700 jobs.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell rejected by shareholders again", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Keith Hellawell, the embattled chairman of Sports Direct, has been rejected by independent shareholders for the second time in four months, as outside investors repeated calls for the former police chief constable to be ousted from the sportswear retailer\u2019s board. In a second poll, forced by independent investors under new City rules, 54% of the group\u2019s outside shareholders voted against Hellawell\u2019s re-election to the group\u2019s board. They had defeated a similar company resolution to retain Hellawell at the annual meeting in September. However, Hellawell will remain in position after winning 81% of the vote, because of the support of Sports Direct\u2019s founder Mike Ashley, who owns 55% of the company. In a statement issued to the stock exchange announcing the result, Ashley said: \u201cKeith has my full backing and will be continuing in his role on the basis that he has the unanimous support of the board. I note that many of those who voted against Keith have acknowledged that we have made positive progress since the AGM.\u201d At the previous vote in September, Hellawell tried to assuage disgruntlement among investors by promising to step down at the 2017 annual meeting if he did not win the support of independent investors again. However, Ashley risked inflaming relations once again by adding: \u201cI have spoken to Keith Hellawell this afternoon to inform him that I hope that he will reconsider his intention to stand down if he does not receive the backing of a majority of independent shareholders at the 2017 AGM.\u201d The company also appeared to row back on a commitment to conduct an independent review of working conditions and corporate governance, adding: \u201cIn view of continuing frustrations, the board will meet in the near future to reconsider all options in relation to its review of corporate governance.\u201d The additional statements prompted an immediate reaction from Aberdeen Asset Management, the City fund manager which has been among Ashley\u2019s more vocal critics. Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen, said: \u201cThe board should focus on delivering the significant governance change that is expected over the next eight months. \u201cThat is the best way to encourage shareholders to support all resolutions at the AGM in September. If that happens, there will be no need for any discussion of Keith Hellawell standing down.\u201d Ashley\u2019s majority stake did not count towards an independent resolution on Hellawell\u2019s re-election in the first ballot at the group\u2019s annual meeting in September, when 53% of the votes cast by investors excluding Ashley opposed the chairman\u2019s re-election on a marginally higher turnout. That result forced Thursday\u2019s re-election, in which Ashley\u2019s stake counted. Apart from Aberdeen, the City dissenters included Standard Life, Royal London and Hermes, which advises a string of investors. Standard Life said the insurance company was concerned at the lack of progress being made by the retailer: \u201cIn particular, we are disappointed to note the lack of progress in recruiting a chairperson for the independent governance review, an initiative that we see as being fundamental to Sports Direct fulfilling its long-term value creation potential.\u201d Before the vote last September, Hellawell also attempted to appease disgruntled shareholders by saying he had offered to go, although the board had refused to accept his resignation. Despite that offer seeming to acknowledge that he and the board accepted responsibility for the group\u2019s situation, last month Hellawell criticised MPs, trade unions and the media for waging a campaign against the business as it reported a 57% drop in first-half profits. The results represented the latest disappointing financial statement after the company\u2019s share price halved during 2016. The group was relegated from the FTSE 100 in March. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of the shareholder proxy voting service Manifest, said Hellawell must stand aside at the September 2017 AGM and Sports Direct had to make big changes: \u201cThey have eight months until the next AGM to get new people in. They are losing goodwill and this is an existential threat to the business, and they have to respond to do something about it.\u201d Other shareholder advisory bodies have also weighed into the debate. Pirc and Institutional Shareholder Services advised clients to vote against Hellawell, with the latter saying he had overseen a \u201ccatalogue of governance and operational failures\u201d. However, their rival Glass Lewis, which supported Hellawell at last year\u2019s AGM when it instead recommended a vote against Ashley\u2019s reappointment, urged its clients to back the chairman again. The crisis at Sports Direct was triggered by a Guardian investigation in 2015, which revealed that workers at the firm\u2019s Derbyshire warehouse were paid less than the national minimum wage. The scandal prompted a parliamentary inquiry last year, in which MPs likened the depot to a Victorian workhouse, reigniting long-held concerns about the level of control Ashley enjoys at the company. The newspaper reports also encouraged some investors to react after years of backing the board, including 76% of independent shareholders voting for Hellawell\u2019s reappointment at the 2015 annual meeting. Aberdeen, which owns 0.3% of Sports Direct, said it viewed the company as having made progress by implementing an independent review into working practices and appointing the investment banker David Brayshaw as a non-executive director. It also views the departures of the chief executive, Dave Forsey, and acting chief financial officer, Matt Pearson, as positive moves. The company has not had a full-time, board-level finance director for more than three years.",

      "bodyText": "The maker of the Brompton fold-up bike is hoping the launch of an electric model this year will kickstart growth after a 40% fall in annual profits. Underlying profits at Brompton Bicycle slumped to \u00a31.3m in the year to 31 March 2016, after costs rose by \u00a31.8m. The London-based business has invested heavily in developing an electric bike with Formula One group Williams, renting a new factory and investing in a New York office. However, sales rose 3.4% to \u00a328.4m as it sold 2% more bikes, recovering from a 4% fall in 2015. Will Butler-Adams, the chief executive, said growth had been lower than expected amid a global slump in bicycle sales, partly prompted by the rise of electric bikes in northern Europe. Issues with smog in Singapore, changing trends in the US and economic difficulties in South Korea had also dampened demand. Sales in the UK remained steady. Brompton, which moved to new premises in west London in 2015, aims to produce 100,000 bikes a year by 2020. The company has invested \u00a32.5m in the facility and expects to spend \u00a32m on developing its electric bike. Butler-Adams said: \u201cWe are a little company going through growing pains. There are periods in manufacturing where you have got to take a big risk. We went to shareholders before we took them on this rollercoaster \u2026 they knew it was coming.\u201d Despite the profits squeeze, the company paid a \u00a3485,656 dividend to its shareholders, who include members of the Sainsbury supermarket family, founder Andrew Ritchie and Luke Johnson, the Pizza Express entrepreneur who bought a 5% stake in Brompton in 2015. Ritchie, who developed the Brompton bike in 1975, holds a 20% stake in the company and remains its biggest shareholder, despite stepping down from the board last year amid a dispute with Butler-Adams over the pace of expansion. Butler-Adams said Brompton was now past its \u201ckiller year\u201d and expected to see improved profits and sales in 2017 through increased efficiency at its new factory. Sales in the UK have also strengthened after a tough 2015. He said he hoped the launch of the electric bike at the end of 2017 would kickstart sales, especially in northern Europe. In Germany, the electric bike market has ballooned from about \u20ac20m (\u00a317m) 12 years ago to \u20ac1.2bn. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an electric bike and so we are missing out on that,\u201d Butler-Adams said. The bike has taken four years to develop, but Butler-Adams said it was \u201cmonstrously unique\u201d because the folding model had to be light, compact and simple. He said he expected the UK\u2019s exit from the EU to be positive for the company. Brompton, which sells nearly 80% of its bikes overseas, has reduced its prices by 7% outside the UK, exploiting the fall in the pound\u2019s value against the euro and the dollar. Butler-Adams said concerns about relations with Europe were \u201ccompletely irrelevant\u201d when compared with the scale of opportunity in the US and China. \u201c[The debate over trade negotiations with Europe] is mostly gubbins for our business,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 is trading 15 points higher at 7,205.35, putting it on track for yet another all-time closing high. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC are broadly flat, while the Dow on Wall Street is slightly down, trading just below the historic 20,000 mark. With this, we are closing the blog for the day. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Dennis de Jong, managing director at online forex broker UFX.com, was quick to react to the survey data. The US services industry accounts for two-thirds of the country\u2019s economic output, so the above-expectations ISM non-manufacturing PMI for December will please Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed, especially as it comes on the back of broadly encouraging financial data of recent weeks. The US economy was remarkably resilient in the face of growing uncertainty during 2016, and the markets reacted positively to Donald Trump\u2019s election in November. With the president-elect now just weeks away from the White House, the challenge is to deliver the growth he has promised. The Dow Jones is still in negative territory, but has improved slightly from the open. It is now down 8 points at 19,934.68. The closely watched ISM survey for the US has come in stronger than expected. The non-manufacturing sector PMI, from the Institute for Supply Management, rose to 57.2 in December from 57.2 in November. The new orders sub-index jumped from 57 to 51.6, the highest since August 2015. Another piece of labour market data from the US, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s key non-farm payrolls: the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped 28,000 to 235,000 last week, according to the US Labour Department \u2013 close to the 233,000 touched in November, a 43-year low. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has opened nearly 14 points lower at 19,928.41, as expected \u2013 its first lower open in 2017. It got tantalisingly close to the historic 20,000 mark yesterday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have both slipped a couple of points. Here in London, the FTSE 100 is now more than 10 points ahead at 7,201.18, a 0.16% gain, and could get to another record close today. It would be the sixth in a row. The longest run of all-time closing highs (eight in a row) was in May 1997. The Haldane event has now finished. Back to the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane, who is answering questions at the Institute for Government, a think tank. He said the central bank was keeping an eye on the recent strong growth in consumer lending but saw no need for alarm. You\u2019ll have seen and read from our Financial Policy Committee that this is something that they\u2019re keeping a close... eye on. And they are right to do so. Nonetheless, we need to put all this in a bit of context. Aggregate borrowing by households isn\u2019t tearing away right now. We\u2019ve gone through a long period where borrowing, both by companies and households, has actually been rather subdued. US stocks are set for their first lower open of the year, following the weaker-than-expected jobs data and the minutes of the last Fed meeting. Almost every Fed policymaker thought Donald Trump\u2019s promises of tax cuts and infrastructure spending could stoke higher inflation, which could force the central bank to step up rate hikes this year. The Dow Jones has been flirting with the 20,000 mark for weeks but future markets suggest it will open 15 points lower today. It has never broken through that level before. It closed at 19,942.16 yesterday. Over in the US, the ADP National Employment Report (from payrolls processor ADP) indicated that employers in the private sector created 153,000 jobs last month, below Wall Street forecasts of a job gain of 170,000. The figures come a day before the government\u2019s key non-farm payrolls data. US Treasury bond yields slipped on the news. Haldane reiterated the Bank of England\u2019s view that economic growth will slow a little while inflation will pick up materially this year, following the sharp fall in the value of sterling since the EU referendum. That [higher inflation] will in turn produce something of a squeeze on the spending power of consumers and may lead them to throttle back somewhat in their spending plans. It might not happen, they might choose to run down their savings. But it\u2019s possible, indeed I\u2019d say likely that there will be something of a slowdown. You can watch the Haldane event live here. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist is answering questions at the Institute for Government. More from Andy Haldane. He sees a \u201cvery interesting disconnect\u201d between the political uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote and the strength of the stock market and the economy. Regarding the surprising strength of household spending, Chris Giles, the Financial Times\u2019 economics editor, wrote this piece yesterday. Little is more fashionable at the start of 2017 than criticising UK economic expertise. A sizeable majority of the profession expected a vote for Brexit would rapidly hit Britain\u2019s economic performance and we now know this to be wrong. For some, such as Michael Gove, the prominent Brexiter, the error is sufficient proof of politically motivated groupthink to justify dismissing economists almost entirely. For others, the error requires economists to confess they know very little about the macroeconomy. Both responses are dangerous non sequiturs. A far better response is to admit to the error, understand what went wrong and learn lessons. Excuses should be avoided. It is not good enough to say most forecasts were based on an assumption of an immediate UK notification of Article 50 and the Bank of England leaving policy unchanged. Brexit uncertainty exists regardless of when the UK informs the EU of its intention to leave \u2014 and monetary policy operates with a long delay. In fact, we know the predominant source of error. It stemmed from underestimating the strength of household consumption after the vote for Brexit. Economists expected a vote to leave would increase household savings in the short term, both as precautionary insurance against uncertainty and to begin an adjustment to a less prosperous future. These were reasonable guesses, based on recent household behaviour \u2014 for example, at the time of huge banking uncertainty early in 2008. But rather than rising, household savings fell throughout 2016. The savings ratio dropped to an exceptionally low level in the third quarter as consumers went on a borrowing and spending binge not seen since before the financial crisis. But why has consumer spending been so strong? The interesting question is why households acted in this way. There are three plausible reasons. First, households correctly thought Brexit would improve their personal finances and borrowed and spent accordingly. Second, they were deceived into expecting economic gains from Brexit and still went out to spend. And, third, households watched sterling tumble, understood the likely effect on prices and brought forward their consumption, so they were spending in the knowledge their money would buy less in future. Some Reuters flashes on Haldane: He said there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to think this year will be harder for consumers than 2016, and that higher UK inflation would likely lead to slowing consumer spending, although he added that was not inevitable. He also said that consumers last year behaved almost as though the Brexit vote had never happened. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, is speaking about productivity and other matters at the Institute for Government. The Bank of England hasn\u2019t released a text, but here are some tweets from journos and others who are there. Mike Ashley said: Keith has my full backing and will be continuing in his role on the basis that he has the unanimous support of the board. I note that many of those who voted against Keith have acknowledged that we have made positive progress since the AGM. At the group\u2019s annual meeting in September, 53% of the votes cast by independent shareholders opposed the chairman\u2019s re-election. Ashley wasn\u2019t allowed to vote at that meeting. The crisis at Sports Direct was triggered by a Guardian investigation in 2015, which revealed that workers at its giant Derbyshire warehouse were paid less than the national minimum wage. The scandal prompted a parliamentary inquiry last year, in which MPs likened the depot to a Victorian workhouse, reigniting long-held concerns about the level of control Ashley enjoys at the company. News just in from the Sports Direct shareholder meeting at its Shirebrook headquarters. Chairman Keith Hellawell has survived another shareholder vote, despite growing opposition from investors such as Aberdeen Asset Management. The former chief constable been re-elected to the board with 80.9% of investors backing him and 19.1% voting against. Company founder Mike Ashley, who owns 55% of the company, was able to vote this time. However, nearly 54% of independent shareholders voted against Hellawell\u2019s re-election, and only 46% backed him. My colleague Simon Goodley had previewed the meeting. The FTSE 100 has had a great run recently, thanks to the weakness of sterling, which has benefited all the dollar earners in the index. London\u2019s leading shares recorded all-time closing highs on the final three trading days of 2016 and continued their rally this week, closing at new peaks on Tuesday and Wednesday. (The market was closed on Monday, a Bank Holiday). The five consecutive record closes mean the FTSE is inching closer to the longest run of record closes in May 1997, when it notched up eight consecutive all-time closing highs. However the FTSE is trading over 3 points lower again at the moment. Time for a lunchtime round-up. European trading is somewhat lacklustre, as expected. The FTSE 100 in London hit another all-time high, of 7,211.96 this morning but is now barely in positive territory \u2013 trading 3 points higher at 7,192.68. The Dax in Frankfurt has slipped just over a point to 11,582.64 while the CAC in Paris is nearly 4 points ahead at 4,903.31. The final batch of UK PMI survey data was stronger than expected, and suggests the economy grew by a healthy 0.5% in the final three months of the year \u2013 down slightly from 0.6% in the previous quarter. Higher taxes and jitters over the EU referendum pushed down high-end London property prices last year as sellers accepted more \u201crealistic\u201d offers, according to upmarket estate agent Savills. The Bank of Cyprus has fully paid back the emergency funds it received from the European Central Bank during its crisis in 2013. The country\u2019s biggest lender said it had repaid the entire \u20ac11.4bn emergency liquidity assistance funding. Crude oil prices are rising again after reports that Saudi Arabia had embarked on discussions with customers about lowering crude sales by up to 7%, in an attempt to support efforts by the Opec cartel to reduce the global oil glut. The news swept away doubts that Opec wasn\u2019t serious about its November agreement to reduce production and wouldn\u2019t cut as much as promised. Brent crude is 28 cents ahead at $56.74 a barrel, a 0.5% gain. One source told Reuters: Aramco [The Saudi Arabian Oil Company] is approaching all its customers for possible cuts from February and discussing likely [supply] scenarios. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, agreed to cut output by 486,000 barrels per day. This amounts to 4.6% of its October production of 10.5m barrels. The new year is starting well for people working at Aldi: The German discounter is giving more than 3,000 staff a pay rise in an attempt to leapfrog rival Lidl to become the highest-paying supermarket in the UK. My colleague Rob Davies writes: Employees at the fast-growing supermarket chain will earn \u00a38.53 per hour and \u00a39.75 if they live in London, starting from 1 February. While Aldi\u2019s hourly rate in the capital will be the same as the new minimum announced in November by Lidl, staff outside London will earn 7p an hour more. Both supermarket chains have now matched or bettered the the voluntary minimum pay suggested by the Living Wage Foundation. The stories you need to read, in one handy emailRead more The weak performance of UK hotels and restaurants recorded in today\u2019s services survey is at odds with other data. New figures from VisitEngland out just now show that Brits spent \u00a345.3bn on day trips across England in the first 11 months of 2016, setting a new record for the survey. Spending is up 7% on the previous year. The number of day trips was also the highest ever, rising to 1.35bn, up 14% on the same period in 2015. VisityEngland is promoting day trips to Hull, the UK city of culture this year; the women\u2019s cricket world cup final at Lord\u2019s cricket ground; and the British Music Experience, which has moved from London to Liverpool and opens at the Cunard Building in February. My colleague on the economics desk Katie Allen has taken a close look at the strong UK services survey. ... and it\u2019s back in positive territory, just. Persimmon is leading gains this morning after a strong trading update, along with fellow housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt. Persimmon shares are nearly 6% ahead at \u00a319.13. The FTSE 100 has just turned negative, slipping just over 2 points to 7187.57. Much of its recent strength \u2013 it\u2019s had a run of five consecutive record closes \u2013 has been underpinned by the weaker pound, as many companies on the index are dollar earners. On the currency markets, sterling has recovered some ground against the dollar since the strong PMI data came out, to $1.2311. The dollar is also being knocked by a surge in China\u2019s yuan, prompted by a rise in overnight borrowing costs in Hong Kong. That triggered a broad round of profit taking on the greenback, Reuters reported \u2013 sending the dollar down by more than 1% against the yen and past $1.05 against the euro. Scotiabank\u2019s head of European fixed income strategy Alan Clarke\u2019s verdict is: Brexit clearly hasn\u2019t hurt business sentiment, the acid test is whether this feeds into the hard data. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, has sent his commentary on the PMI survey findings: Hiring has revived alongside upturns in new orders and business confidence, but prices continue to rise sharply. All of which adds weight to the argument that the next move by the Bank of England is as likely to be a rate hike as a cut. He said sterling weakness continued to be seen as a key driver of growth, but mainly for manufacturers. However, while manufacturers again reported stronger export sales in December, buoyed by the more competitive exchange rate, there were few signs of the weak pound boosting spend from overseas tourists in the service sector. Service sector expansion was driven by business service providers and financial services, with transport and communications and IT also showing robust growth. Activity in the hotels and restaurant sector fell for a second month running. What happened to the mini-tourism boom? The FTSE 100 index hit a new record peak of 7,211.96 earlier this morning, and is now trading just below the 7,200 mark at 7,197, up 0.1%. And here\u2019s some instant reaction from economists. They tend to be cautious, saying that the stronger-than-expected economic momentum isn\u2019t likely to last. Scott Bowman of Capital Economics says: December\u2019s Markit/CIPS report on services suggests that the UK economy will turn in another strong performance in Q4 and hasn\u2019t lost any momentum since the vote to leave the EU. The support provided to activity from a lower pound and rock-bottom interest rates should prevent growth from slowing too sharply. Overall, our forecast is for GDP growth to ease from around 2.0% in 2016 to about 1.5% in 2017. Dean Turner at UBS Wealth Management echoed those comments. The robust nature of recent economic data has been supported by a number of factors, in particular the weaker pound, as well as looser monetary and fiscal policy. As we move further into the year, our expectation is that these positive effects may begin to fade. Moreover, higher inflation is likely to erode household income growth which could dampen the up to now buoyant consumer. Here is some instant Twitter reaction. The survey findings took economists by surprise (again). They had pencilled in a slight easing in services growth in December. Let\u2019s dig deeper into those numbers. The final batch of UK PMI survey data for 2016 from IHS Markit and CIPS suggested that the service sector expanded strongly in December to the fastest rate since July 2015, fuelled by stronger growth in new work. The index remained above 50 for the fifth consecutive month, indicating a continued recovery from the contraction suffered in July linked to the EU referendum. However inflationary pressures are also picking up with prices charged by firms surging at the fastest pace since April 2011, due to the decline in sterling since the Brexit vote. The UK services PMI hit a 17-month high of 56.2 in December, up from 55.2 in November, according to Markit/CIPS, which compile the survey. The all-sector PMI, which pools the services, manufacturing and construction survey findings, is also at a 17-month high, rising to 56.4 from 55.1 in November. Markit said this points to GDP growth of 0.5% in the fourth quarter, down a tick from 0.6% in the third quarter. Falling prices for luxury pads and mansions in London triggered more deals in the autumn, says upmarket estate agent Savills. Its latest figures for prime central London show prices fell 2.1% between October and December, and by 6.9% over the year as a whole. Prices are down 12.5% since their 2014 peak. Higher property taxes coupled with political and economic uncertainty have been dragging down prices. Savills is forecasting zero growth over the next couple of years. In outer prime London, where the average value is just below \u00a32m, prices fell 4% last year and are just 2.7% down from where they were two years ago. Savills collected data that suggests from January to the end of November there were around 320 sales worth over \u00a35m in London, with a total of over \u00a33.7bn spent. The number of sales was 17% below the same 11 month period of 2015. Contrary to some reports, the very top end of the market has been more active than in 2015. In the 11 months to the end of November \u00a31.43bn was spent on properties worth over \u00a320m compared to \u00a31.07bn in 2015. Lucian Cook, Savills UK head of residential research, said: We saw a real dearth of transactions over the late spring and summer months following the race to beat the new 3% surcharge [stamp duty]. But further price adjustments, coupled with the currency play for international buyers, appear to have triggered greater buyer commitment and prime London sales volumes picked up significantly in September, October and November before easing back in December. But he cautioned: Buyer sentiment remains fragile. Improved transaction levels are the result of adjusted pricing and should not be seen as a precursor to price rises in the foreseeable future. High stamp duty rates and the uncertainty created by negotiations to leave Europe will still need to be factored into expectations on value. The forecast is for prime central London growth to total 21% in the five years to the end of 2021. Meanwhile the British car industry is warning of a sales downturn this year as the economic uncertainty that followed the Brexit vote kicks in. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham writes: A fifth consecutive year of growth saw nearly 2.7m new car registrations in the UK last year, a rise of 2.2% on 2015. But the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it expected growth to reverse, with a sales decline of 5-6%, as the cost of new cars rises due to sterling\u2019s fall. An end to cheap financing deals would also hit sales, it said. As a reader has helpfully pointed out, global debt levels surged to more than 325% of the world\u2019s GDP last year \u2013 mainly because of a sharp increase in government debt, according to a report from the Institute for International Finance. Reuters has the details: The IIF\u2019s report found that global debt had risen more than $11 trillion in the first nine months of 2016 to more than $217 trillion. The report also found that general government debt accounted for nearly half of the total increase. Emerging market debt rose substantially, as government bond and syndicated loan issuance in 2016 grew to almost three times its 2015 level. China accounted for the lion\u2019s share of the new debt, providing $710 million of the total $855 billion in new issuance during the year, the IIF reported. Higher borrowing costs in the wake of the US presidential election and other stresses, including \u201can environment of subdued growth and still-weak corporate profitability, a stronger [US dollar], rising sovereign bond yields, higher hedging costs, and deterioration in corporate creditworthiness\u201d presented challenges for borrowers, the IIF said in its report. There\u2019s not much corporate news here in London so far, apart from a Persimmon trading update. One of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, it shrugged off Bexit uncertainty and posted 8% growth in revenues to \u00a33.2bn for 2016, when it built 15,171 homes. The York-based company said reservations for new homes remained healthy during the autumn, echoing comments made by other housebuilders. At 11am the embattled retailer Sports Direct will kick off a shareholder meeting at its Shirebrook HQ. Its chairman, Keith Hellawell, a former chief constable, is under growing pressure to step down. He already lost a vote of independent shareholders in September but his offer to resign was rejected by the board. Will he survive today\u2019s meeting? A series of City investment groups, including Aberdeen Asset Management, have called on shareholders to oppose his re-election to the retailer\u2019s board. But this time round the company\u2019s billionaire founder Mike Ashley, who owns 55% of the business, is allowed to vote, which means Hellawell could well cling on. The US Federal Reserve is cautious over the pace of interest rate hikes this year, amid a great deal of uncertainty over how much fiscal policy loosening the Trump administration will unleash, i.e. tax cuts. Last night the minutes of the American central bank\u2019s 14 December meeting which concluded with a 25 basis point rate hike, the first in a year, and only the second since the 2008 financial crisis. The minutes showed that only half of Fed officials included some form of fiscal policy loosening into their economic projections. The median projection at that meeting suggested three more 25bp rate hikes this year, which could take the fed funds target range to between 1.25% and 1.5% by the end of 2017. However some economists think there could be more \u2013 Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says: Assuming that the incoming Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress do agree on a major package of tax cuts by mid-year, however, we still think there will be four rate hikes this year, albeit with three of those hikes coming in the second half of 2017. The recurring theme in the minutes is the uncertainty over the direction of fiscal policy that Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected election victory has thrown up. Neverthless, almost all participants \u201cindicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies.\u201d Some participants thought the upside risks to inflation had increased too. The dollar\u2019s subsequent rally will help to keep a lid on inflation next year, but all that will do is partly offset the impact of the rally in crude oil prices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. This morning at 9:30am we\u2019ll get the UK services purchasing managers\u2019 index from Markit/CIPS for December, a closely watched survey. It is expected to show a slight easing in activity, to 54.8 from 55.2. Anything above the 50 mark indicates expansion. The sister surveys for manufacturing and construction showed both sectors growing at a robust clip, suggesting the economy was stronger than many expected in the fourth quarter, despite the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. The Irish services PMI is already out. It indicates growth in Ireland\u2019s services sector rebounded in December, returning close to the level where it was before Britain voted to leave the European Union. Ireland is considered to be most at risk from the Brexit vote because of its close trading links with the UK. The Investec services PMI for Ireland rose to a five-month high of 59.1 in December from 56 in November, adding to a strong manufacturing survey earlier in the week which showed factory activity at a 17-month high. In the US, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s December non-farm payrolls report we get the latest ADP employment report which is expected to show a drop from November\u2019s 216,000 to about 175,000, while the latest ISM services sector survey is forecast to show a slight slowdown to 56.8, from 57.2 in November. Back in the UK, Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, is speaking at an Institute for Government event on \u2018An economy that works for everyone\u2019 at 1pm today. Britain\u2019s leading share index notched up another record close yesterday when the FTSE 100 gained 0.17% to end the day at 7,7189.74\u2013 the fifth trading day in a row it closed at an all-time high. But today could be different \u2013 European stock markets are set for a somewhat lacklustre opening. Michael Hewson, chief market economist at CMC Markets UK, is predicting: FTSE100 is expected to open unchanged at 7,189 DAX is expected to open 4 points higher at 11,588 CAC40 is expected to open unchanged at 4,899",

Economists expected a vote to leave would increase household savings in the short term, both as precautionary insurance against uncertainty and to begin an adjustment to a less prosperous future.</p> <p>These were reasonable guesses, based on recent household behaviour \u2014 for example, at the time of huge banking uncertainty early in 2008. But rather than rising, household savings fell throughout 2016. The savings ratio dropped to an exceptionally low level in the third quarter as consumers went on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7ccbf80-d264-11e6-9341-7393bb2e1b51\">borrowing and spending</a> binge not seen since before the financial crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>But why has consumer spending been so strong?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The interesting question is why households acted in this way. There are three plausible reasons. First, households correctly thought Brexit would improve their personal finances and borrowed and spent accordingly. Second, they were deceived into expecting economic gains from Brexit and still went out to spend. And, third, households watched sterling tumble, understood the likely effect on prices and brought forward their consumption, so they were spending in the knowledge their money would buy less in future.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T13:41:09.819Z\">at 1.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-586e488ee4b081b2b4eda569\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T13:25:40.946Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BOE's Haldane: 2017 harder for consumers than 2016</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some Reuters flashes on Haldane: He said there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to think this year will be harder for consumers than 2016, and that higher UK inflation would likely lead to slowing consumer spending, although he added that was not inevitable.</p> <p>He also said that consumers last year behaved almost as though the Brexit vote had never happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c655772501b810068f4aee85c4c8a11f4c71d1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c655772501b810068f4aee85c4c8a11f4c71d1c/0_247_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Haldane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Haldane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T13:26:23.096Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-586e4713e4b081b2b4eda565\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T13:22:02.078Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, is speaking about productivity and other matters at the Institute for Government.

Its latest figures for prime central London show prices fell 2.1% between October and December, and by 6.9% over the year as a whole. Prices are down 12.5% since their 2014 peak.</p> <p>Higher property taxes coupled with political and economic uncertainty have been dragging down prices. Savills is forecasting zero growth over the next couple of years.</p> <p>In outer prime London, where the average value is just below \u00a32m, prices fell 4% last year and are just 2.7% down from where they were two years ago.</p> <p>Savills collected data that suggests from January to the end of November there were around 320 sales worth over \u00a35m in London, with a total of over \u00a33.7bn spent. The number of sales was 17% below the same 11 month period of 2015.</p> <p>Contrary to some reports, the very top end of the market has been more active than in 2015. In the 11 months to the end of November \u00a31.43bn was spent on properties worth over \u00a320m compared to \u00a31.07bn in 2015.</p> <p>Lucian Cook, Savills UK head of residential research, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We saw a real dearth of transactions over the late spring and summer months following the race to beat the new 3% surcharge [stamp duty]. But further price adjustments, coupled with the currency play for international buyers, appear to have triggered greater buyer commitment and prime London sales volumes picked up significantly in September, October and November before easing back in December.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he cautioned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Buyer sentiment remains fragile. Improved transaction levels are the result of adjusted pricing and should not be seen as a precursor to price rises in the foreseeable future. High stamp duty rates and the uncertainty created by negotiations to leave Europe will still need to be factored into expectations on value.</p> </blockquote> <p>The forecast is for prime central London growth to total 21% in the five years to the end of 2021.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09269889663bc694d81e1381bacfbae59f1a3212\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09269889663bc694d81e1381bacfbae59f1a3212/0_1441_2574_1543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grosvenor Crescent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grosvenor Crescent</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T09:31:22.108Z\">at 9.31am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-586e04c4e4b081b2b4eda447\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T08:35:54.008Z\">8.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile the British car industry is warning of a sales downturn this year as the economic uncertainty that followed the Brexit vote kicks in. <em>Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham writes:</em></p> <p>A fifth consecutive year of growth saw nearly 2.7m new car registrations in the UK last year, a rise of 2.2% on 2015.

The minutes showed that only half of Fed officials included some form of fiscal policy loosening into their economic projections.</p> <p>The median projection at that meeting suggested three more 25bp rate hikes this year, which could take the fed funds target range to between 1.25% and 1.5% by the end of 2017. However some economists think there could be more \u2013 Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Assuming that the incoming Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress do agree on a major package of tax cuts by mid-year, however, we still think there will be four rate hikes this year, albeit with three of those hikes coming in the second half of 2017.</p> <p>The recurring theme in the minutes is the uncertainty over the direction of fiscal policy that Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected election victory has thrown up. Neverthless, almost all participants \u201cindicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies.\u201d Some participants thought the upside risks to inflation had increased too. The dollar\u2019s subsequent rally will help to keep a lid on inflation next year, but all that will do is partly offset the impact of the rally in crude oil prices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-586defc1e4b0de5081fa2738\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T07:38:27.415Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The agenda: UK, Irish and US services PMIs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>This morning at 9:30am we\u2019ll get the UK services purchasing managers\u2019 index from Markit/CIPS for December, a closely watched survey.

Micheldever, based in the picturesque Hampshire village of the same name, is owned by private equity group Graphite Capital, which has previously sold Maplin Electronics and Paperchase. If Graphite\u2019s latest sale goes through, it will mean the top two British tyre distributors are now in Japanese hands, after Kwik-Fit was sold to trading house Itochu for \u00a3637m in 2011. It will also provide further evidence of a growing appetite among Japanese investors for UK assets. Japanese firms spent $32.9bn (\u00a327.2bn)on 42 British firms last year, according to figures from financial markets analysis firm Dealogic. The lion\u2019s share of last year\u2019s spending was accounted for by SoftBank\u2019s \u00a324bn acquisition of smartphone chip maker ARM Holdings, unveiled in July. But Japanese firms struck a series of less high-profile deals during 2016, both before and after the slump in the value of sterling triggered by the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Sumitomo appears twice in the top five, after agreeing to spend $138m to buy the Dunlop sporting goods brand from Sports Direct, although that deal has yet to complete. Earlier in the year, Japanese instant noodle firm Nissin built a stake of more than 19% in Premier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling cakes and Oxo cubes. A distribution deal between the two firms was among the factors that complicated a takeover bid for Premier Foods from US firm McCormick, the company behind Schwartz dried spices. McCormick eventually walked away from the deal after Premier Foods held out for a higher offer. Graphite Capital is understood to have been seeking a buyer for some time before Sumitomo expressed its interest. The two sides have now struck a \u00a3215m deal, 3.7 times Graphite\u2019s initial investment in 2006, with Sumitomo expected to continue the firm\u2019s expansion, subject to the transaction winning regulatory approval from the European Union. MTS has grown under Graphite\u2019s ownership, increasing turnover from \u00a3150m to more than \u00a3320m and expanding its workforce from 600 people to 1,600. MTS chief executive Duncan Wilkes said the deal would ensure the same management would continue to run the firm, which supplies about 6m tyres a year. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 January 2017. An earlier version said that Takeda Pharmaceuticals had acquired Crescendo Biologics for $790m. In fact the two companies signed a collaboration and license agreement worth up to $790m to develop and commercialise Crescendo\u2019s cancer technology.",

      "bodyText": "Higher taxes and jitters over the EU referendum pushed down high-end London property prices last year as sellers accepted more \u201crealistic\u201d offers, according to upmarket estate agent Savills. But while owners of multimillion-pound London homes were forced to rein in their expectations, housebuilder Persimmon reported rising revenues from sales of less expensive homes around the country. Savills said prices for prime central London properties fell by 6.9% compared with last year and 4.9% when including the rest of the capital. But the real estate firm said a collapse in the number of sales had slowed as sellers adjusted asking prices to reflect increases in stamp duty and the dampening effect of the Brexit vote. Lucian Cook, Savills\u2019 UK head of residential research, said this helped ease a slump in sales volumes since April, when a 3% stamp duty surcharge was imposed on second homes, triggering a rush to complete transactions before a 1 April deadline. \u201cAfter that peak, you had a lull in transactions, which was compounded by Brexit, leading to a very slow summer market,\u201d said Cook. \u201cSince the vote we\u2019ve seen a further softening but in the post-summer period there have been progressively improving transaction levels. \u201cSellers became much more realistic on price as they adjusted to the market reality.\u201d The number of \u00a31m homes sold in 2016 was down 21% year on year, according to data firm Lonres. But this represented a strong rebound from the three months to July, when sales volumes slumped to half of 2015 volumes after the stamp duty change. Sales of \u00a35m homes in the 11 months to the end of November proved more resilient at 17% lower than 2015, Savills said, with transactions adding up to \u00a33.7bn. And the most expensive homes worth more than \u00a320m resisted any downturn at all, with \u00a31.4bn spent in the first 11 months compared with \u00a31bn the year before. Savills said the 6.9% fall in prime central London property prices was not as steep as the 9% it predicted earlier in the year. But Cook warned sellers should not see improved conditions as an indicator that prices are due to rise again. \u201cImproved transaction levels are the result of adjusted pricing and should not be seen as a precursor to price rises in the foreseeable future. \u201cHigh stamp duty rates and the uncertainty created by negotiations to leave Europe will still need to be factored into expectations on value.\u201d Savills expects prime London property to remain stagnant for the next two years, with prices down 12.5% since December 2014, when the government increased stamp duty on the most expensive homes. While Savills reported lower prices for upmarket London property, housebuilder Persimmon enjoyed rising revenues as the availability of mortgages helped boost prices for less expensive homes. The firm\u2019s average selling price was up 4% to \u00a3206,700, boosting its sales by 8% to \u00a33.1bn, while legal home completions grew by 599 to 15,171. \u201cSales reservations through the autumn season were strong with healthy customer demand for new homes,\u201d said Persimmon. \u201cBuying a new-build home remains a compelling choice supported by competitive mortgage offers which continue to make a new home purchase very affordable.\u201d The builder was the best performer on the FTSE 100 on Thursday morning, with shares up more than 5%. Persimmon will report full annual results on 27 February and said it expects to report improved conditions in the second half of the year.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s services sector grew at the fastest pace for 17 months in December, according to a survey that has raised hopes for a strong end to 2016 for the economy. There was also a pick-up in new business and job creation, according to the poll of firms from the UK\u2019s biggest sector, which includes banks, hotels and transport. But news that companies increased their prices at the fastest pace for more than five years will intensify worries over the weak pound stoking inflation in the months ahead and raises the prospect of interest rates going up this year. The main reading on the closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI (pdf) confounded economists\u2019 expectations of a slowdown. It increased for the third month running to 56.2 from 55.2 in November and signalled the fastest growth for the dominant services sector since July 2015. Economists had forecast 54.7 in a Reuters poll. It was the fifth month running that the index was above the 50 mark, which separates growth from contraction, having briefly plunged below it in the wake of June\u2019s referendum on EU membership. The report follows stronger-than-expected surveys from the smaller manufacturing and construction sectors this week. The polls\u2019 compilers said that taken together they point to the economy growing 0.5% in the final quarter of 2016, only a slight slowdown from 0.6% in the third quarter and confounding forecasters who had predicted growth would grind to a halt before the end of the year because of Brexit worries. \u201cA buoyant service sector adds to signs that the UK economy continues to defy widely held expectations of a Brexit-driven slowdown,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. He said that, with the all-sector PMI now at a 17-month high and signs of costs pressures, talk of an interest rate hike was likely to grow. The Bank of England cut official interest rates to a record low of 0.25% after the Brexit vote as part of a package of measures to shore up confidence and keep businesses and consumers spending. Since then policymakers have highlighted they face a trade-off between keeping inflation in check and supporting the jobs market and wider economy. Williamson added: \u201cAt face value, this improvement suggests that the next move by the Bank of England is more likely to be a rate hike than a cut, but policymakers are clearly concerned about the extent to which Brexit- related uncertainty could slow growth this year. \u201cThey will therefore consider the current resilience of the economy alongside the elevated levels of uncertainty highlighted by the historical weakness of business optimism about the year ahead. Any change in policy therefore looks unlikely in the short-term, and the next move in policy could as much be a rate cut as a hike.\u201d The report signalled that new business increased at the fastest rate since July 2015, with companies linking the improvement to a range of factors, including new product launches, government contracts and export business. Employment growth continued for the fifth month running in December, with the rate of job creation unchanged from November\u2019s seven-month high. Markit said the jobs reading was stronger than the long-run survey average but that employment growth over 2016 as a whole was weaker than the trends shown in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Cost pressures remained \u201celevated\u201d, the report said. Companies\u2019 costs, or input prices, rose at the second-fastest rate since April 2011, linked to the weak pound, which has made imports to the UK more expensive. \u201cHigher food and fuel prices were widely mentioned, while labour, IT and oil-based items such as packaging were also cited as being up in price,\u201d the PMI report said. As a result, services companies raised their own charges at the fastest rate since April 2011. The survey covers a large part of the services sector, but not retailers. Those rising prices could soon squeeze consumer spending, economists warned. Scott Bowman at the consultancy Capital Economics said: \u201cA moderation in growth in 2017 seems likely as rising inflation eats into households\u2019 real income growth. \u201cNonetheless, the support provided to activity from a lower pound and rock-bottom interest rates should prevent growth from slowing too sharply. Overall, our forecast is for GDP growth to ease from around 2.0% in 2016 to about 1.5% in 2017.\u201d The PMI reports chime with a modestly upbeat tone in the latest survey from the British Chambers of Commerce. That suggested firms had enjoyed increases in export sales and orders but showed they were worried that rising import prices would slow growth this year. Alan Clarke at the Scotiabank in London said the less timely official data would now be key to confirming the message from the surveys. \u201cBrexit clearly hasn\u2019t hurt business sentiment. The acid test is whether this feeds into the hard data,\u201d he said.",

Employees at the fast-growing supermarket chain will earn \u00a38.53 per hour and \u00a39.75 if they live in London, starting from 1 February. While Aldi\u2019s hourly rate in the capital will be the same as the new minimum announced in November by Lidl, staff outside London will earn 7p an hour more.

Aldi said the increase means it is now the highest paying company in the supermarket sector, adding that 3,356 staff stood to benefit. It pointed out that it also paid staff for breaks, which it claimed Lidl did not.

The discounter said 5,500 employees \u2013 a quarter of its UK workforce \u2013 would benefit from the pay rise, which puts them on a minimum of \u00a38.45 an hour, or \u00a39.75 an hour in London.

      "bodyText": "The British car industry has warned of a sales downturn this year as the economic uncertainty that followed the Brexit vote kicks in. A fifth consecutive year of growth saw nearly 2.7m new car registrations in the UK last year, a rise of 2.2% on 2015. But the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it expected growth to reverse, with a sales decline of 5-6%, as the cost of new cars rises due to sterling\u2019s fall. An end to cheap financing deals would also hit sales, it said. But Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said the domestic market remained comparatively strong. \u201cThis is historically an incredibly high level. We\u2019re not talking about a collapse,\u201d he said, adding that the market had been more resilient than expected after the EU referendum. But, he said: \u201cClearly, we have not seen the full effects [of Brexit] yet.\u201d About 85% of new cars are imported, mostly from Europe, and although manufacturers had hedged currencies and absorbed costs, the weak pound would see prices rise by about 2-3% next year, he said. Interest rate rises, which could be triggered by rising inflation, would threaten a market where motorists regularly switch to new cars through loan and trade-in deals. With 80% of sales coming through such deals, Hawes said, vehicles had been affordable as long as interest rates were low. Hawes said the boom had also been driven by the raft of new models available and rapid changes in technology. \u201cEvery niche imaginable is being filled by not just one brand but a number of them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people want connectivity in their cars.\u201d Minis, luxury vehicles and SUVs have seen the biggest growth in the new car market, with traditional family saloons becoming less popular, he said. The number of electric vehicles sold has continued to grow quickly, but from a small base. Just under 89,000, or 3.3%, of all cars sold in 2016 were hybrid, electric or used an alternative fuel. Despite the diesel emissions scandal and concerns about air quality, diesel still represented almost 48% of all cars sold. While sales figures for individual manufacturers are not released until the end of the week, the VW Group, which admitted in late 2015 to having designed vehicles to cheat emissions tests, had a \u201cvery good year\u201d for sales in 2016, said Hawes. British car manufacturing figures for 2016 will be published this month, but Hawes indicated that any hopes that the Brexit vote would be accompanied by a patriotic desire to buy British did not appear to be supported by the data. Rather, Hawes said, British manufacturers may have been harmed by a European consumer boycott \u2013 due to the Brexit vote \u2013 cited by the Jaguar Land Rover boss, Ralf Speth, in the autumn. The SMMT said the eventual Brexit settlement with Europe would be critical, with tariffs likely to add up to \u00a31,500 to the price of an imported car. Hawes said: \u201cThe strength of the market does depend on maintaining good economic and trading conditions so cost of vehicles can remain competitive. We don\u2019t want to see tariffs.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The British car industry has warned of a sales downturn this year as the economic uncertainty that followed the Brexit vote kicks in.</p> <p>A fifth consecutive year of growth saw nearly 2.7m new car registrations in the UK last year, a rise of 2.2% on 2015. But the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it expected growth to reverse, with a sales decline of 5-6%, as the cost of new cars rises due to sterling\u2019s fall. An end to cheap financing deals would also hit sales, it said.</p> <p>But Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said the domestic market remained comparatively strong. \u201cThis is historically an incredibly high level. We\u2019re not talking about a collapse,\u201d he said, adding that the market had been more resilient than expected after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">the EU referendum</a>. But, he said: \u201cClearly, we have not seen the full effects [of Brexit] yet.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/tesla-uk-prices-new-year-currency-brexit-vote\">Tesla to hike UK prices by 5% in the new year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>About 85% of new cars are imported, mostly from Europe, and although manufacturers had hedged currencies and absorbed costs, the weak pound would see prices rise by about 2-3% next year, he said. </p> <p>Interest rate rises, which could be triggered by rising inflation, would threaten a market where motorists regularly switch to new cars through loan and trade-in deals. With 80% of sales coming through such deals, Hawes said, vehicles had been affordable as long as interest rates were low.</p> <p>Hawes said the boom had also been driven by the raft of new models available and rapid changes in technology. \u201cEvery niche imaginable is being filled by not just one brand but a number of them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people want connectivity in their cars.\u201d</p> <p>Minis, luxury vehicles and SUVs have seen the biggest growth in the new car market, with traditional family saloons becoming less popular, he said.</p> <p>The number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/electric-cars\">electric vehicles</a> sold has continued to grow quickly, but from a small base. Just under 89,000, or 3.3%, of all cars sold in 2016 were hybrid, electric or used an alternative fuel. </p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/sep/23/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-explained-diesel-cars\">the diesel emissions scandal</a> and concerns about air quality, diesel still represented almost 48% of all cars sold. While sales figures for individual manufacturers are not released until the end of the week, the VW Group, which admitted in late 2015 to having designed vehicles to cheat emissions tests, had a \u201cvery good year\u201d for sales in 2016, said Hawes.</p> <p>British car manufacturing figures for 2016 will be published this month, but Hawes indicated that any hopes that the Brexit vote would be accompanied by a patriotic desire to buy British did not appear to be supported by the data. </p> <p>Rather, Hawes said, British manufacturers may have been harmed by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/european-customers-boycotting-british-cars-eu-brexit-vote-jaguar-land-rover\">European consumer boycott \u2013 due to the Brexit vote</a> \u2013 cited by the Jaguar Land Rover boss, Ralf Speth, in the autumn.</p> <p>The SMMT said the eventual Brexit settlement with Europe would be critical, with tariffs likely to add up to \u00a31,500 to the price of an imported car.</p> <p>Hawes said: \u201cThe strength of the market does depend on maintaining good economic and trading conditions so cost of vehicles can remain competitive. We don\u2019t want to see tariffs.\u201d</p>",
