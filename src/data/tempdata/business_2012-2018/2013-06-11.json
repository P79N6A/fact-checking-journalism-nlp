      "bodyText": "There have been three distinct phases for British industry during the financial and economic crisis of the past six years. In phase one, manufacturing output fell off a cliff, dropping by 15% peak to trough as global demand shrank at a rate not seen since the 1930s. The UK was not alone in suffering; indeed, other countries including Germany and Japan suffered even bigger falls. Phase two was the recovery that began in 2009. Sterling fell by more than 25% on the foreign exchanges between 2007 and early 2009, making UK exports more competitive and imports dearer. Helped also by a pickup in global demand, manufacturing production recovered half the ground lost during the recession by the autumn of 2010. At that point, the recovery faltered and phase three began. With the debt crisis in the eurozone casting a long shadow, factories saw their output drop by 4% between late 2010 and early 2013 and are now producing only 3% more than they were in the dark days of 2009. The question now is whether a fourth phase, which will see a sustained increase in manufacturing production and a better balanced economy overall, has begun. Some City analysts were disappointed that output dipped by 0.2% this April, but that followed chunky increases in the previous two months. The quarter on quarter increase of 0.5% was the strongest for almost two years. Forward-looking surveys look promising. Even so, it looks premature to declare that phase four is in full swing. Certainly, Vince Cable, the business secretary, would be reluctant to do so. That's not just because the forward-looking surveys have in the past heralded too many false dawns for comfort. Given the size of the fall in the pound, the rise in manufacturing output has been disappointing and far too concentrated in the pharma and transport sectors. In part that's because the euro crisis that stopped recovery in its tracks is far from over. In part, it's because the squeeze on real incomes at home has stifled consumer demand, which has made companies reluctant to invest.",

Once more Open Europe has helpfully outlined what they see as the main points, along with a bit of commentary:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2022 [Weidmann] warned that ECB OMT blurs the line between monetary and fiscal policy - this makes it more difficult to achieve price stability and spreads solvency risks amongst eurozone countries but without using any parliamentary/democratic approval</p> <p>\u2022 Pushed for a narrow interpretation of a central bank's primary mandate, complete focus on price stability</p> <p>\u2022 Suggested that the OMT does represent potential losses for taxpayers, since if the ECB took on significant amounts of risky debt it may face a large loss which it cannot absorb and require aid from member states</p> <p>\u2022 Argued that even secondary market purchases can overturn the force of market discipline and undermine fiscal autonomy</p> <p>\u2022 Issued a warning over the interpretation of the real risk premiums for bonds, which he suggested was very subjective and dependent on future policies</p> <p>\u2022 Weidmann did accept that the inflation outlook in the eurozone fits with price stability at the moment but still expressed serious concern about comprising the ECB\u2019s focus on this.</p> <p>It\u2019s seems to us that, of the two sides, Weidmann had the tougher case to make. Ultimately, as much of the above shows, he is forced to consider hypothetical scenarios and potential worst cases. These are undoubtedly risks that should be highlighted but it does leave one feeling that his argument is slightly less clear cut than Asmussen\u2019s.</p> <p>Having heard the key testimony of both sides, we still expect the court to side with the ECB but with some caveats (although how strict they will be is very much up in the air). Of course, this could still develop more tomorrow.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p>And on that note we are ending our own proceedings until tomorrow.

However, that suggests that the OMT framework might be released just as a eurozone country dashes for the protection of the ECB, as it loses the confidence of the markets. <em>Not ideal....</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51b7234ee4b0d5cbdff9806b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-11T13:17:02.712Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>South Africa is feeling the force of today's sell-off.

      "bodyText": "And that wraps up Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann's testimony for the day. Once more Open Europe has helpfully outlined what they see as the main points, along with a bit of commentary: \u2022 [Weidmann] warned that ECB OMT blurs the line between monetary and fiscal policy - this makes it more difficult to achieve price stability and spreads solvency risks amongst eurozone countries but without using any parliamentary/democratic approval \u2022 Pushed for a narrow interpretation of a central bank's primary mandate, complete focus on price stability \u2022 Suggested that the OMT does represent potential losses for taxpayers, since if the ECB took on significant amounts of risky debt it may face a large loss which it cannot absorb and require aid from member states \u2022 Argued that even secondary market purchases can overturn the force of market discipline and undermine fiscal autonomy \u2022 Issued a warning over the interpretation of the real risk premiums for bonds, which he suggested was very subjective and dependent on future policies \u2022 Weidmann did accept that the inflation outlook in the eurozone fits with price stability at the moment but still expressed serious concern about comprising the ECB\u2019s focus on this. It\u2019s seems to us that, of the two sides, Weidmann had the tougher case to make. Ultimately, as much of the above shows, he is forced to consider hypothetical scenarios and potential worst cases. These are undoubtedly risks that should be highlighted but it does leave one feeling that his argument is slightly less clear cut than Asmussen\u2019s. Having heard the key testimony of both sides, we still expect the court to side with the ECB but with some caveats (although how strict they will be is very much up in the air). Of course, this could still develop more tomorrow. And on that note we are ending our own proceedings until tomorrow. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back in the morning. Fears that the central bank money taps could be turned off gripped the markets and sent them sharply lower. The Bank of Japan set the trend by keeping monetary policy on hold, and later came trader talk that the US Federal Reserve might use next week's scheduled meeting to begin the process of easing off its bond buying programme. With unrest in Turkey, the Greek privatisation failure and the German court hearing, investors were in a pessimistic mood: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 60.37 points or 0.94% lower at 6340.08 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 1.03% to 8222.46 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.39% lower at 3810.56 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB lost 1.63% at 16,286 \u2022 Spain's Ibex slid 1.68% to 8089.3 Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off its worst levels, down just 20 points or 0.12%. Latvia was hit hard by the financial crisis, but has made a remarkable recovery without bailouts or riots. Now, despite worries about the future of the eurozone, the country is set to become the latest member of the single currency. Ian Traynor reports in full here but below is a flavour: In the centre of Riga, a copper figure of Latvia's mythical maiden soars skyward holding three golden stars. Nicknamed Milda, she stands at the top of the Freedom Monument, symbolising the Baltic country's hard-won liberty and independence. From next January Milda will become a more familiar face across Europe when her likeness is stamped on to \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins to mark Latvia becoming the 18th member of a single currency zone which may, or may not, be emerging from a three-year period of fighting for its life. For Greeks or Portuguese, the euro may have seemed like a prison in recent years. But for Latvia, or at least for its government and elite, the maiden-faced currency will symbolise freedom and independence, reinforcing the vulnerable small country's integration in the west and another big step in liberating itself from its historical tormentor, Russia. More from Weidmann: Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann - who is likely to argue that ECB boss Mario Draghi's intervention was illegal - is up now at the constitutional court in Karlsruhe and starts by saying price stability is the ECB's core mandate. He is telling the court he sees a risk the OMT programme could slow eurozone reform efforts and reduce the ECB's credibility. While admitting the OMT was successful in lowering bond yields, he said it could have long term consequences and could lead to a weakening of fiscal consolidation. And here's his full statement (in German). Asmussen has now finished and Open Europe has handily summed up the key points of his testimony: \u2022 The OMT will have the ability to sell bonds as well as buy them, and it will not take them off the market permanently, unlike its forerunner the SMP (in fact Asmussen repeatedly highlighted the differences between the two) \u2022 the OMT is pari passu (equal to) other creditors \u2022 the OMT seeks only to reduce unwarranted interest rate spikes and is not aimed at harmonising financing conditions of member states \u2022 the ECB would react if a country were to try to game the system by converting all its bond issues to a short maturity (of up to three years), but that in any case markets themselves would \"see through and deny\" such attempts \u2022 the only risks associated with the programme stem from countries operating \"un-sound\" policies, but that those states that fail to comply with the OMT's conditionality could be faced with the prospect of having to leave the eurozone. He also said that he would welcome the ECB publishing minutes of its meetings. Amussen said markets would see through, and deny, any attempts by countries to change 10 year debt to 3 year debt to benefit from the OMT (courtesy Open Europe) And here's a key point, with Asmussen attempting to deal with a major criticism of the bond buying plan: Asmussen also says he does not expect a debt haircut for any eurozone country. Here's the full text of his statement to the court. More from Asmussen, as he distinguishes between the OMT and the ECB's earlier Securities Markets Programme (SMP): J\u00f6rg Asmussen, Germany's representative on the European Central Bank's governing council, is up at the constitutional court again. He is defending the OMT - its Outright Monetary Transactions or bond buying programme - saying it was the right decision for price stability in the eurozone. He said the ECB measures were necessary, effective and within its legal remit. He added that the bond buying scheme needed to be unlimited to show the ECB was serious about defending price stablity. The OMT would only suffer losses if states were to default. But the ECB does not want to, and is not allowed to, substitute actions by democratically-elected governments. The ECB just wanted to prevent a eurozone break-up. He said: Only a currency whose existence is not in doubt can be a stable currency. Quote courtesy Reuters. And he continues: So to recap - the OMT programme is unlimited and had to be, but is at the same time limited because it is focused on shorter maturity bonds... Back in Greece, and the government is said to be planning to close down public broadcaster ERT and re-open it with fewer staff. According to Kathimerini: Sources said that Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has already taken the decision to pull the plug on the broadcaster in its current form and the government has started drawing up the relevant legislation. ERT currently employees 2,800 people. It is not clear how many employees will remain but sources indicated it would be a fraction of those in work at the moment. In case you're wondering, it seems a bit becalmed in Karlsruhe at the moment. Although..... In common with other global markets, Wall Street is also taking a bit of a tanking. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 126 points or 0.84%, with some putting two and two together and suggesting the US Federal Reserve may unveil plans to start unwinding its stimulus package at its scheduled meeting next week. This could well just be traders trying to find a concrete explanation for the day's sell-off, of course. It's early days, but S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung's Ulrich Schaefer reckons that the German Constitutional will not impose new restrictions on the OMT programme: Still all to play for though, with the Bundesbank's Jens Weidmann still to outline his concerns. (and with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher....) The German court should be back at work, after a lunch break, according to the FT's Michael Steen who's at Karlsruhe. Back to the court hearing in Karlsruhe. Jorg Asmussen's statement that the ECB hasn't seen the need to publish the legal framework for OMT (see 12.49pm) has caused some concern. OpenEurope, the think tank, asks whether the ECB is being deliberately obstructive, commenting: It does beg the question: what are they trying to hide? Maybe nothing, but at the very least it seems they are trying to have the best of both worlds. By refusing to reveal the exact terms and conditions, the ECB can try to address German concerns over the extent of the OMT (as we have seen them doing in the run up to this case) while also being able to continuously reassure markets that the scheme is in fact \"unlimited\". Such a balancing act is tough to pull off and may add to confusion if it breaks down. (that's from their own coverage of the court hearing) Asmussen assured the judges that the ECB would publish the legal framework before admitting a country to the programme. However, that suggests that the OMT framework might be released just as a eurozone country dashes for the protection of the ECB, as it loses the confidence of the markets. Not ideal.... South Africa is feeling the force of today's sell-off. The Rand has fallen by 1% to a four-year low against the US dollar, and shares are also lower, as Steve Collins of London &amp; Capital Asset Management flags up: There's a lot of pretty wild moves in the financial markets today. Europe's stock markets are hitting new lows, with the FTSE 100 now down 100 points (-1.55%) and deeper losses in Spain and Italy, both down over 2.5%. Southern European government debt also continues to be pummelled, driving up Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece's bond yields through the trading session (details below) And in the currency markets the yen has surged by 2% against the US dollar -- seemingly as traders seek a safe haven for their money (Dow Jones's Katie Martin explains why here). That's raising new fears that Japan's stimulus package will unravel because Abenomics depends, in part, on a weaker currency helping exports. So what's going on? It's a confusing picture, but traders keep pointing to concerns that the world's central banks will ease their monetary stimulus packages soon. The Bank of Japan's decision early this morning to leave policy unchanged, and raise its economic forecasts, makes the City suspect that the days of ultra-loose monetary policy could be numbered. So, investors are pulling money out of riskier assets, with emerging markets feeling the full force of the sell-off. The German court hearing (highlights from 10.28am) is also casting a shadow over the markets, even though a verdict isn't expected for several weeks, and the Judges are unlikely to block OMT. Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at IG, explains: Despite the continued aggressive monetary easing from the Bank of Japan, the failure to adapt additional stimulus measures to help ease volatility in debt markets has caused European markets fall into the red in early trade. In Europe, the two-day court hearing in Germany\u2019s constitutional court is catching the attention of all market participants. Adding to the uncertainty, the legitimacy of the ECB president\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions programme is being called into question, given that Mr Draghi has been credited with saving the day and helping to drive down peripheral bond yields with his now famous \u2018everything it takes\u2019 statement. The fear that German support for the ECB could waver is also serving to unwind much of the confidence and is contributing to the risk-off mode. The selloff is particularly stark in Greece, where the main index has tumbled 5%. There's clear alarm over its privatisation programme, despite prime minister Samaras's attempt to calm the situation today (see 12.12pm). And here's the key bond yields: \u2022 Greek 10-year bond yield: 10.64%, up 104 basis points (1.04%) \u2022 Portuguese 10-year bond yield: 6.67%, up 42 basis points \u2022 Spanish 10-year bond yield: 4.76%, up 17 basis points \u2022 Italian 10-year bond yield: 4.46%, up 18 basis points But it's not just 'peripheral' debt that's been hit. UK, US and German bonds are also falling in value, pushing up their yields and contributing to the sense of unease. As Miller Tabak, the Wall Street firm, warned clients this morning: Stocks across [Europe] are taking a shellacking to the tune of around 2% as rising German bund yields prompt accelerated losses for government bonds around the periphery Yields on Spanish and Italian debt are rising to the highest in six weeks. The loss of last week\u2019s lows for equity markets is all too much to bear in most cases and the resilient tone appears to have been snapped like a twig. Via Business Insider. Viktor Nossek, head of research at Boost ETP, told Reuters that investors were also taking profits as the summer lull looms. Over on Wall Street, traders expect the Dow to fall when trading begins at 2.30pm BST. A few photos from today's Constitutional Court hearing have arrived: Here's a snap of the two Germans who are taking opposing sides at the hearing: Asmussen added that the ECB could agree on making bond purchases under OMT \"very quickly\", if a country asked for help. J\u00f6rg Asmussen, Germany's representative on the European Central Bank's governing council, is now giving evidence to the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe. Asmussen is telling judges that the ECB hasn't yet seen the need to publish the legal text surrounding OMT, but would certainly do so before allowing any country to join the programme. The legal framework behind OMT is something of a mystery. A few months back, Mario Draghi revealed that it was still a work in progress. Last week, though, he suggested it was all-but ready for publication. Over in Greece, prime minister Antonis Samaras has promised that his government will not bring in additional austerity measures following the shock collapse of the privatisation of gas company DEPA yesterday. At a press conference with former eurogroup president and curent Luxembourg PM Jean-Claude Juncker, Samaras said that Greece's plans for asset sales remain on track. New cutbacks will not be needed to cover the loss of revenue from DEPA, Samaras pledged, saying: The plans for privatizations will continue. Whatever problems arise will be overcome. Claims that new measures will be required are absurdities. Intruigingly, Samaras blamed the collapse fo the deal on reasons \"beyond\" Greece. Insiders have suggested that Russia's Gazprom walked way because it believed the European Union would not allow it to buy DEPA. The issue was also raised in Brussels at the European Commission's midday press briefing, where spokesman Simon O'Connor said the EC wants Greece to put DEPA back on the auction block quickly. The outcome of the privatisation process of the gas sector in Greece is very important from the point of view of revenues and the impact on the reform of the energy sector. In this context the privatisation of DEPA should resume as soon as possible...The design and execution of the privatisation programme is the responsibility of the Greek authorities. More details here Meanwhile, Greece's Kathimerini flags up that Juncker is to receive Greece's highest honor, the Grand Cross of Order of the Redeemer. Samaras even referred to him as \u201cone of us\u201d as he completed his two-day visit to Athens. Juncker chaired the eurogroup of euro finance ministers until the end of last year, during which time Greece received two bailouts. The legal challenge to the ECB's bond-buying programme has been brought by a group of Germans, including conservative lawmaker Peter Gauweiler, a team of professors, a citizens organization and Germany's Left Party. They all argue that OMT is illegal because under German law only the national parliament can decide how taxpayer money is spent. This is rejected by the ECB, which is represented by Jorg Asmussen. His fellow German, Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann, will explain its concerns. Both men are expected to give evidence later today.... Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble went on to tell German's top judges court that they should respect the independence of the European Central bank: Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has defended the ECB's bond-buying programme as the German constitutional court's eagerly awaited hearing got into full swing. Sch\u00e4uble told judges in Karlsruhe that he is confident that the ECB is acting within its mandate by offering to buy \"unlimited\" quantities of peripheral bonds from countries who also agree to a reform programme. He said: The German government sees no signs that the measures taken by the ECB so far violate its mandate. Sch\u00e4uble also warned judges that rejection of the OMT could lead to Germany leaving the eurozone, with \"unforeseeable' consequences. He also said he didn't believe the ECB's measures fell within the remit of the German courts. However, as the FT's Michael Steen flags up, Sch\u00e4uble did add one reservation \u2013 as OMT hasn't actually been deployed yet, so he's only working off Mario Draghi's statements. Sch\u00e4uble's support is significant, as the German Bundesbank is one of the parties arguing against the OMT. Its head, Jens Weidmann, believes the programme is tantamount to the financing of governments by the central bank. In the UK, the latest industrial production data has shown that Britain's manufacturing revival stumbled in April. Factory output fell by 0.2% during the month, the first decline in three months. It dents hopes that industrial growth will help rebalance the UK economy, explains our economics editor Larry Elliott: The ONS said falls in transport equipment, wood and paper products and metals were the main factors behind the monthly drop but added that in the three months to April \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend \u2013 output was 0.5% higher than in the three months ending in January 2013. Industrial output, which also includes energy use, rose slightly. Here's Larry's full story: UK manufacturing revival halts in April Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has offered support to the ECB this morning over the Constitutional Court hearing: The German Constitutional Court has begun its hearing into the European Central Bank's government bond-buying programme, over in Karlsruhe. Constitutional Court president Andreas Vosskuhle kicked proceedings off by explaining that he and his fellow judges would not be swayed by the positive impact that that Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) programme had on the financial markets. In his opening statement, Vosskuhle said the Court would simply consider the legality of OMT: It plays no role in the assessment of the constitutionality of the legal rules and measures that are being looked at whether they were successful in the broadest sense. The Bundesbank, which brought the case, claims OMT breaks German law by financing other European states, a charge the ECB denies. Gloom from Finland this morning, where the central bank has slashed its growth forecasts for this year. The Bank of Finland now predicts its economy will shrink by 0.8% this year, having previously expected growth of 0.4%. It also more than halved its 2014 growth forecast, to 0.7% from 1.5%, as the eurozone recession hits Finnish companies hard. Bank of Finland Governor Erkki Liikanen said Europe's downturm made it harder for Finland's economy to rebalance: The Finnish economy has faced two major changes at the same time: the restructuring of (its)... industry and the recession in the wake of the financial crisis. The BoF's warning comes after Finland officially fell into recession, having suffered a 0.1% drop in GDP in the first three months of 2013. It said the debt crisis was calmer than last year, but had not been eliminated (echoing Switzerland's own warning this morning \u2013 see 8.16am): The risk of a renewed exacerbation of the (international) financial and debt crisis has not disappeared, but the probability is less. Liikanen warned that \"the outlook for the immediate years ahead remains poor\", as Finland's economy isn't competitive enough. Public debt levels are rising and the situation will deteriorate without tax rises or spending cuts. Finland's economy isn't expected to return to its pre-crisis size by 2015, and Liikanen's message was blunt - With exports fading, overall demand has been reliant on domestic demand, particularly with household consumption rising. With income development across the economy as a whole weak due to the problems with exports, domestic demand has increasingly been funded with debt: both household and general government expenditure have been higher than income. The current account has gone into deficit, meaning the entire economy is accumulating net debt. This despite Finland being the only member of the eurozone that is still rated AAA/stable by the three largest rating agencies. This chart, from Norwegian trader Financial Acrobat suggests fund managers became rather more jittery about holding high yield (ie riskier) assets towards the end of last month: The sell-off in peripheral debt has hit Greek and Portuguese government bonds hard this morning, driving up their yields (the effective interest rate on the debt). Spanish and Italian bonds are also down. Here's the damage: \u2022 Greek 10-year bond yield: 10.35%, up 75 basis points (0.75%) \u2022 Portuguese 10-year bond yield: 6.6%, up 37 basis points \u2022 Spanish 10-year bond yield: 4.67%, up 8 basis points \u2022 Italian 10-year bond yield: 4.34%, up 6 basis points Traders are mainly blaming fears that the days of ultra-loose monetary policy may be over, especially those who had hoped for yet more easing from the Bank of Japan. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explained: Japan\u2019s BoJ was the overnight disappointment, electing to sit on its hands rather than expand intervention as markets had been hoping. There's a gloomy mood in the financial markets this morning as shares and bonds both fall. The main European indices are all in the red this morning, following a 1.45% drop on the Japan's Nikkei overnight after the Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged. There's also a big selloff in eurozone peripheral debt. A few factors are being blamed \u2013 including this morning's clashes in Turkey (where riot police moved in to clear Taksim Square), and the German court hearing. But as Jeremy Cook of World First explains, the \"ongoing deterioration\" in the emerging markets is the main theme. Emerging market debt has been a great investment through the beginning of the year, and was set to remain so as long as the global glut of cheap money continued from the world\u2019s central banks. However, the past few weeks have seen investors become concerned that the Fed will \u2018taper\u2019 their asset purchase plan soon, the Bank of Japan may have already failed in its attempt to support the Japanese economy and the ECB\u2019s \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 mentality has fallen by the wayside. Bond yields to follow The German constitutional court will start its hearing on the legality of the European Central bank's bond buying programme at 11am local time (10am BST). It pits the Bundesbank against the ECB, and thus Germany's top central banker, Jens Weidmann, against the country's man at the ECB, J\u00f6rg Asmussen. At issue, whether Mario Draghi's pledge to buy unlimited amounts of bonds issued by a eurozone country that signs up for stringent economic reforms is legal. Ian Traynor, our Europe editor, has explained the issues here: German court considers legality of ECB intervention policy: It is not clear what the German court, which is not expected to rule finally on the dispute until after general elections in September, can do to stop the ECB as it does not have jurisdiction over the non-German institution. Although it is not viewed as likely, the court would be able to tie the hands of the German government and the Bundesbank or curb its involvement in the ECB policy. Or it could send the dispute to the European court of justice. The promise of OMT has helped to push down Italy and Spain's borrowing costs - even without a single bond being bought (as Draghi proudly declared at last week's ECB press conference). So the court's decision really matters. As Stan Shamu of IG put it: It is important for the OMT backstop to remain available in order to keep confidence steady. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest developments across the eurozone and the global economy. First up: the Swiss government has warned that the eurozone recession remains the biggest single threat to its economy, in its latest assessment of its economy. Economists at the State Secretariat for Economics (SECO) pointed to the \"profound economic and structural problems of the euro area\", cautioning: The largest economic risk is still the debt crisis in the euro area... The weak euro zone economy continues to act a brake on the global economy. While they conceded that progress had been made in recent months, the Swiss clearly don't share Francois Hollande's upbeat assessment that the eurozone crisis is over. SECO argues that Europe's financial crisis \"cannot be regarded as addressed\" because countries in southern Europe are still \"relatively far from a significant economic improvement\". SECO also pointed to the risk that \"growing social tensions and political disagreement\" could inflame the debt crisis again and spark another panic in the financial markets. This could put also fresh upward pressure on the Swiss Franc \u2013 which is currently pegged against the euro to prevent it rising too high. Despite Europe's woes, the Swiss government is pinning its hopes on exports to North America and Asia. SOCA raised its growth forecasts for this year to 1.4%, from 1.3% \u2013 while predicting the eurozone will shrink by 0.7%. SOCA's full statement is here. What else is coming up today? The main event will probably be the start of the German constitutional court's two-day hearing into the legality of the ECB's new bond-buying programme, the Outright Monetary Transaction scheme. The Court may not issue a ruling until the autumn, and will probably give its approval to OMT (although may add conditions). Still, we'll be watching events in Karlsruhe, along with other developments though the day as usual.....",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares fell sharply again on worries that central banks could be about to start turning off the money taps, the key support for markets in recent months. News that the Bank of Japan had, against some expectations, kept monetary policy on hold set the tone and pushed the yen higher against the dollar. Then came talk that the US Federal Reserve might take the opportunity at next week's scheduled meeting to begin easing off its bond buying programme. On top of that, eurozone woes returned, with Greece's failed privatisation on Monday and a German court hearing on the legality of the European Central Bank's bond buying plan to support the euro. Continued violence in Turkey did not help sentiment. But shares recovered from their worst levels, and the FTSE 100 closed down 60.37 points lower at 6340.08 having fallen as low as 6280. Miners were among the leading fallers on concerns about global economic growth, particularly in China. Evraz, due to be ejected from the FTSE 100 when this week's reshuffle is announced, fell 7.3p to 117.3p while Polymetal, also expected to be demoted to the FTSE 250, was down 27p at 617p. Fresnillo fell 42p to \u00a310.76 after Citigroup cut its target price from \u00a311.20 to \u00a310.45 with a sell rating, despite a recent site visit showing \"impressive progress\". The bank said: Management is delivering on goals, transparent and shareholder focused. We have maintained for some time that Fresnillo is best-in-class among UK precious metals miners, but our bearish view on silver and our concerns about its limited free float causing excessively high valuations means we rate Fresnillo as sell. Glencore Xstrata dipped 11.8p to 302.5p on talk it was considering combining its coal assets with those of Rio Tinto, down 37.5p at 2702.5p. Fund management groups were under pressure again as markets headed lower, with Aberdeen Asset Management down 18.3p to 395.8p and Man dropped 6.6p to 86.25p. Catering group Compass closed 17.5p lower at 838p as Goldman Sachs moved from buy to neutral, saying: While we see Compass' strong organic growth, low revenue volatility, low capital intensity, and strong balance sheet as attractive, we now see more upside potential elsewhere in our sector coverage. But Rolls-Royce rose 6p to \u00a311.87 as Exane BNP Paribas issued an outperform rating and raised its target price from \u00a310.75 to \u00a313.40. It said: Rolls-Royce shares are at a record high. Paradoxically, some investors seem to be questioning free cash flow conversion, which is close to an all-time low. We expect a strong upswing in cash generation from 2014 as Rolls-Royce's fleet in civil aerospace matures. This, coupled with the safety of Rolls' earnings and the upside from much more generous dividends, should result in further re-rating. Tullow Oil added 5p to \u00a310.17 after a positive note from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The bank said: We reiterate our buy rating and price objective/net asset value of 1,570p, offering around 60% upside potential, post a significant de-rating and ahead of imminent catalysts. A series of disappointing exploration wells since October 2012 have resulted in a 33% pullback; below 1,000p for the first time since August 2011. Now trading at our core plus development net asset value and with three well catalysts upcoming, we believe it offers a very attractive entry point. Among the mid-caps, online grocer Ocado jumped 13p to 325p as investors shorting the shares continued to close their positions, hurt by the company's recent revival. There was also a smattering of revived takeover speculation, with Marks &amp; Spencer mentioned once more. FirstGroup has received a boost on the same day its shares began trading for the first time without entitlement to its \u00a3615m rights issue. The bus and train group is raising the cash from shareholders to cut its borrowings and to invest in its future growth, with a 3 for 2 rights issue at 85p a share. Investors have until 25 June to decide whether or not to take up their entitlement. From Monday's close - adjusting for the ex-rights - its shares dipped around 1p to 99.6p.

      "bodyText": "Last year it was Barack Obama's turn; next year it will be Vladimir Putin's. But this year it is David Cameron's responsibility to corral the leaders of the G8 nations for their annual family photo when they meet at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland. There is something curiously dated about the G8. Its membership includes Italy but not India; Canada but not China. It is as if delegates from Austria and Turkey were invited to peace conferences between the first and second world wars but not representatives from the US and the Soviet Union. But the G8 will not be scrapped. International bodies, once created, are incredibly difficult to kill off, even when they have outlived their usefulness. It was hoped that the G20 \u2013 which does include the bigger developing countries \u2013 would become a more effective vehicle for global governance, leaving the G8 as a largely ceremonial occasion for a handful of western leaders to gather each year for a chinwag and a photo opportunity. In reality, the G20 has proved a big disappointment. More than 20 countries take part and, once the heads of the international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European commission turn up, there can be 30 leaders round the table \u2013 far too many for effective discussion. What's more, only once has the G20 shown any unity of purpose \u2013 and that was in late 2008 and early 2009 when fears of a second Great Depression overrode national self-interest. Since then, the G20 has been directionless, with countries agreeing to disagree on matters such as deficit reduction. International summits work best when there is a problem to be solved, when one country decides to show leadership and when decisions are followed up with action. The US-dominated Bretton Woods conference that led to the creation of the IMF and the World Bank is a case in point. But the international system is in flux, as it was in the first half of the 20th century. The stability of the cold war has been replaced by a world in which the developing countries want greater political power to match their growing economic strength. Countries such as China and India know what they do not want \u2013 they do not want western powers telling them what to do \u2013 but have yet to decide what they do want. As a result, the G20 has become a giant talking shop. The shortcomings of the G20 have given the G8 a chance to reinvent itself as the body that specialises in international development. Without the involvement of China, the G8 cannot hope to come to meaningful agreements on exchange rates. Without the presence and agreement of China, India and Brazil, it cannot cut a deal that would conclude the stalled Doha trade talks. But because G8 countries provide the bulk of global aid they remain big players in international development. Hence the summits have become the moment when the west \"does its bit\" for the poor. The debt-relief campaign came of age at the Cologne summit of 1999; the Gleneagles summit of 2005 pledged debt relief, a doubling of aid and a trade deal. It became the benchmark for subsequent summits, and this year Cameron is looking for progress in three areas: increasing trade, greater corporate transparency and action against tax havens. So what can we learn from the intervening years? Firstly, that G8 has made a difference, particularly in the area of health. There have been hefty falls in child and maternal mortality, and this, despite what the sceptics say, is linked to the money provided by donors. Aid has saved lives. Secondly, the G8 record is somewhat patchier than suggested by the glowing self-assessment report it published last week before the Lough Erne meeting. The G8 gave itself a pat on the back for keeping to past commitments, but a study by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) suggests there is plenty of room for improvement. Education, for example, has had a much lower priority than health, and even the extremely modest commitments made by the G8 have not been met. The ODI notes there have been exaggerated claims, a lack of ambition, and a failure to tackle problems in areas such as trade, agricultural subsidies and climate change where G8 interests are at stake. Kevin Watkins, the ODI's director, said: \"The G8 has acted like a student who ends the term by giving themselves inflated marks. They have self-declared an 'A' for effort and achievement. Our evaluation suggests that a 'B' would be more appropriate, along with a reminder that the student needs to work harder and show more application if they are to realize their potential.\" Thirdly, context matters, and the objective conditions for this year's summit are good. Weak global growth means the G8 should be biddable when Cameron extols the benefits of a trade deal. Western governments are being bled dry by the offshore activities of multinational corporations, which should make it easy to get consensus on cracking down on tax havens. If ever there was a time to make the mining corporations come clean about their activities in Africa, this is it. That the prime minister will be able to hail a summit success is not in doubt. The rules of the G8 club ensure that every leader can claim a major breakthrough on something, and he has had an easy ride from most of the UK NGOs. He has enjoyed a mini triumph with the weekend deal to double the aid directed at tackling malnutrition, and some campaigners believe there is a genuine chance of something big emerging from next weekend's transparency summit. But genuine success would require more. On hunger, it would require recognition that handing responsibility to tackle malnutrition to a global alliance of agri-businesses is more about filling corporate coffers than empty bellies. It would require a trade deal that paid more than lip service to the interests of developing countries \u2013 that means tackling subsidies to US cotton farmers and scaling down the common agricultural policy. And it would involve a deal on tax havens that forced them \u2013 including the tough nuts such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands \u2013 to reveal which individuals, companies and trusts benefit from accounts. If lasting achievement does elude Cameron it will be for three reasons: vested interests have proved too strong; the pressure exerted from civil society has proved too weak; and he left it too late to cajole and persuade his fellow leaders. Reports suggest the prime minister is fully engaged \u2013 but successful G8 summits need years, not weeks, of hard graft. Few leaders are prepared to put in the effort required, which is why most are forgettable affairs that deliver little.",

The bus and train group is raising the cash from shareholders to cut its borrowings and to invest in its future growth, with a 3 for 2 rights issue at 85p a share. Investors have until 25 June to decide whether or not to take up their entitlement. From Monday's close - adjusting for the ex-rights - its shares have added nearly 4% to 103.8p.

      "bodyText": "Britain's brief manufacturing revival came to a halt in April as output fell by 0.2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. Hopes that a pick-up in industry would lead to better-balanced growth in the UK were dented by figures showing the first decline in factory production in three months. The ONS said falls in transport equipment, wood and paper products, and metals were the main factors behind the monthly drop, but added that in the three months to April \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend \u2013 output was 0.5% higher than in the three months ending in January. April's small decline followed increases of 0.7% in February and 1.1% in March. Despite the stronger trend since the turn of the year, officials said factories were producing 10% less than they were in 2007, before the onset of the deep recession in early 2008. Firms found conditions tough in 2012, with the crisis in the eurozone compounding the impact of weak demand at home. Between February and April, manufacturing firms produced 1.2% less than in the same period of 2012. Industrial production, which includes energy supply in addition to manufacturing, rose by 0.1% between March and April and by 0.8% in the latest quarter. High demand for energy during the unusually cold March contributed heavily to the increase, but industrial production in the three months ending in April was 1.5% lower than a year earlier. Steep falls in North Sea output, down 40% in the past five years, has resulted in a fall of almost 20% in industrial production since its pre-recession peak. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, the foreign exchange company, said: \"Recent data from the UK has seen an air of steady, if modest, improvement.
