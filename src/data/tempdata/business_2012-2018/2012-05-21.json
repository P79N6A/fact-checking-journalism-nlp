      "bodyText": "Women claimed just one in 10 executive boardroom appointments over the past year despite ministers' demands that the biggest companies install more women at the top table. A report by Deloitte found that companies are beginning to increase the number of women on their boards, but warned that most were being appointed to non-executive positions rather than more important executive roles. Carol Arrowsmith, a partner in executive compensation at Deloitte, said it was \"clearly not very good\" that nine out 10 of the most important boardroom roles went to men in the year that the government put gender diversity in the boardroom at the top of the agenda. \"This is an improvement on the overall number of executive positions held by women, which stands at around one in every 20, but it is not enough,\" she said. Women fared better in non-executive roles, accounting for 30% of appointments in the FTSE 350. Lord Davies of Abersoch, who led an inquiry into the male dominance of UK boardrooms, said companies should aim for their boards to be at least 25% female by 2015. David Cameron, who has refused to rule out introducing a quota system to force companies to appoint more women, has spoken of a target of 30%, which has the backing of many of the UK's biggest companies.. Deloitte said that despite the \"significant increase\" in women appointed to FTSE 100 boards over the past year it will take until at least 2016 to reach the 30% target \u2013 and that would only be possible if each new woman was replacing a man and if none of the women left. Eleven FTSE 100 companies still do not have any women on their boards, according to a recent study by the Cranfield School of Management. Among those with no women at the top table are mining groups Vedanta Resources, Antofagasta, Kazakhmys and Glencore International. Simon Murray, Glencore's chairman, has gone on the record saying he is not keen on addressing the commodity giant's gender imbalance. \"Pregnant ladies have nine months off. Do you think that means I'm absolutely desperate to have young women who are about to get married in my company?,\" he told the Sunday Telegraph last year. Women now occupy 16% of FTSE 100 board positions \u2013 significantly below Davies' target of 25% by 2015 \u2013 but more than double the figure in 1999. Drinks giant Diageo has the biggest proportion of female directors at 44%. Fashion house Burberry is in second place with three female directors on a board of eight, including chief executive Angela Ahrendts and finance director Stacey Cartwright. The Deloitte report said companies are coming under pressure from shareholders on the issue, with 60% of investors surveyed listing gender diversity as an important element of board composition, compared to 30% of company secretaries. Rolls Royce appointed its second female director on Monday . Jasmin Staiblin, chief executive of ABB Switzerland, joins Dame Helen Alexander, chair of Rolls' remuneration committee. Deloitte said that more than a fifth of FTSE 350 companies still have no active plans to increase the diversity of their boards a year after Lord Davies published his ground-breaking report on women in the boardroom. Davies recommended in February that companies take six months to publish their own targets for bolstering female presence on their boards.",

The Bank's court \u2013 akin to a board of directors \u2013 announced three separate five-month reviews: into the way liquidity was provided to Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS in 2008 and 2009; the Bank's general policy about providing liquidity to the financial system; and into the forecasting capabilities of the monetary policy committee, which has repeatedly failed to predict inflation accurately. None of the reviews covers the crisis at Northern Rock, which in September 2007 suffered the first bank run in Britain since Overend, Gurney &amp; Co in 1866.

He said the Bank should have undertaken a comprehensive review years ago \u2013 and not in the midst of the eurozone crisis \u2013 and he kept up his calls for changes to its oversight system. \"A proper oversight or supervisory board is needed, with the self-confidence and policy expertise to commission reviews, both internally and externally, of Bank performance and to assess their conclusions,\" he said. Only two months after the Bank's governor, Sir Mervyn King, declared himself \"baffled\" at the need for any review into the crisis \u2013 and before sweeping new powers for the Bank are to be debated in the House of Lords \u2013 the court declared that \"now is the right time\" to learn lessons. Sir David Lees, chairman of the Bank's court, said: \"The Court of the Bank of England believes it is important for the Bank to learn practical lessons from past experience in order to improve the way it operates in the future.\" The court pledged to publish the reviews, due to be completed in October 2012.

The review into the so-called \"emergency liquidity assistance\" for RBS and HBOS is to be conducted by Ian Plenderleith, who spent 36 years at the bank before retiring in 2002. The review into the way the Bank's money market operations function during time of crisis is to be conducted by Bill Winters, the former banker who was recently a member of the Independent Commission on Banking. The Bank's record of forecasting inflation and growth will be put under the microscope by David Stockton, a former chief economist at the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, which is credited with being concerned with issues like house prices and unemployment that are excluded from a more narrowly drawn remit for the Bank of England.

Italy has hire and fire laws that allow small businesses to dispense with staff almost at will. These laws go back to the 1970 Workers Statute and combine with rules allowing firms to keep staff on a succession of short term contracts. Adrian Beecroft, the savvy private equity pioneer who has proposed introducing similar laws for the UK in a report for the government, wants to give UK firms with up to nine employees the option of bypassing the rules on dismissals. No more protracted warning procedures. Only statutory redundancy pay as a maximum compensation when you leave the premises. Rome has a slightly higher threshold. It forbids companies with more than 15 employees from firing workers without just cause. Firms with fewer than 15 staff can do what they like. Over the longer term, a two tier system has encouraged firms to stay small. In Italy there are virtually no large companies other than those wholly or partly owned by the state. It is famous for its army of small textile, food and manufacturing firms, especially in the north west, that constitute the powerhouse of the economy. But not anymore. Much of the country's reliance on corporate minnows, which lack the resources to compete with the new Chinese competition, is blamed on the two tier employment laws that encourage firms to stay small. In March Italy's new prime minister Mario Monti said the hire and fire culture among small firms amounted to \"bad flexibility\", arguing the laws penalise young people who cannot start a family or buy a house while they dance to their employer's whims. Monti has attempted to tackle tougher targets that can be found in large unionised firms that are dominated by well protected older workers. It is proving difficult, but at least he can claim a strong rationale. Beecroft says small firms are unable to keep up with the complexities of legislation governing workers rights. So a bonfire of petty rules is needed. But while there are instances around the country of employees attempting to exploit their legal protections, it is not a problem affecting the UK's ability to grow. If anything, cutting employment rights will undermine the confidence of millions of workers to spend right now (for fear of losing their job) and hurt the recovery. If Germany is the manufacturing success story we should want to copy then we had better think about giving workers more rights. More rights to training, more rights to parental leave, better sick leave, and guaranteed pensions.",

With a lull in the political arena it was left to India-focused mining company Vedanta Resources to steal top place of the biggest risers on the FTSE 100.

      "bodyText": "G8 leaders will be no doubt disappointed with the markets' reaction to their weekend attempts to avoid the continued gloom hanging over Europe. The heads of the most powerful countries in the world said they have a desire for growth and want to keep Greece in the eurozone, although how that will happen remains to be seen. In response the markets did, well, very little really, staying almost flat. One glimmer of hope was the the FTSE 100, which after five consecutive days of falling, started the morning up 21 points, or 0.4%, at 5288. The German DAX was also slightly up, 9 points, at 6281, as was France's CAC up 10 at 3018. But Spain and Italy's indexes both continued to dip. The Spanish IBEX was down 35 points, or 0.5%, at 6531, while the Italian FTSE MIB dropped 82 points at 12973. The continued belief is until the Greek crisis has been concluded, there will be little in the way of good news coming from the markets. There was some respite on the FX market for the euro, which had been trading at a four-month low against the dollar, after speculators cut some of their bearish positions, which had seen short positions against the euro climb to the highest levels on record. It led to stirling hitting a two-week low against the euro today, \u00a31 is now worth \u20ac1.27, as IMM positioning data showed net euro short positions fell. Lauren Rosborough, senior FX strategist at Societe Generale explained: \"It looks like the euro is consolidating to some extent. \"If we get some form of contagion [in the eurozone] sterling will benefit from that relative to Europe, but the UK economy will also be affected. It's a bit of a double-edged sword.\" Sterling has rallied against the euro in recent weeks with the pound seen as a potential safe-haven, but this could be knocked later this week when the Bank of England release the minutes from its latest policy meeting, which could reveal an appetite for more quantitative easing. On the FTSE 100, the biggest early riser was listed hedge fund manager Man group, which was up 6.6% to 80.3p a share at 10am. The jump came after the company said it is set to buy hedge fund research specialist Financial Risk Management (FRM). The deal will see FRM integrated into Man's existing multi-manager business, giving it a combined business with \u00a312bn in assets under management. The FRM brand will be kept, with current MD Luke Ellis made chief executive of Man Multi-Manager. The deal will be completed by Q3, and will cost Man up to $82.8m in cash, depending on FRM retaining its current asset levels. Man also get 47.5% of FRM's performance fees over the next three years as part of the deal. Peter Clarke, Man Group chief executive, said: \"This transaction provides us with the opportunity to significantly improve the profitability of our multi-manager business. By combining the complementary investor bases of the two businesses and pairing FRM's well regarded investment process with Man's managed accounts infrastructure, we can increase revenues with no material change to Man's current cost base.\" However, it is worth remembering it has been a tough year for Man, who have lost two-thirds of their value in the last year. The other biggest early risers were mining group Vedanta Resources, up 5.7% to \u00a310.13 a share, followed by Royal Bank of Scotland up 3.6% to 20.7p. Of the biggest fallers, Tesco headed the pile, but only dipping 1.1% to 310p and, unlike the previous week, none of the top ten biggest morning fallers included any banks. Overall the outlook is still far from rosy. James Hyerczyk, analyst at Autochartist, said: \"Although value-based investors may be looking for an opportunity to re-enter or add to established positions, the downside momentum has been too strong to stop the price slide. \"As long as there is relentless selling pressure, the index may move lower to test the November bottom at 5,075.20 before garnering strong enough buying to turn the tide.\" Chris Weston, institutional trader at IG Markets, said: \"The world is bereft of good news and perhaps the most optimistic thing the bulls can cling onto right now is new polls are predicting that pro-bailout party New Democracy would get 23% of the votes [in the Greek General Election].\" It would seem the G8 have brought themselves the slightest of breathers, but investors remain weary following a statement that was strong on sentiment but short on solutions.",

      "bodyText": "Ed Balls has accused David Cameron of exacerbating the eurozone crisis by \"posturing\" over Greece and warned that the G8 summit's failure to come up with a clear plan will prove \"absolutely catastrophic for Britain, Europe and the world\". The shadow chancellor's attack came after the prime minister said that a second Greek vote next month backing parties opposed to the EU's bailout package would be a decisive vote to leave the euro, for which contingency plans had to be made. Balls told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't think David Cameron's posturing helps at all, I think it just makes it worse.\" He added: \"Spain and Italy are huge. Our country, our companies, are exposed to them. There is no plan to stop contagion to Spain and Italy. If that happens it is absolutely catastrophic for Britain, Europe and the world and we have come out of a summit with no plan and Britain still supporting the [Angela] Merkel view that we don't need a plan.\" Balls said an in/out referendum on Europe was not issue for Britain in the \"coming months\" but suggested it could not be \"run by elites and excluding talking populations\". Cameron had raised the stakes on Sunday by warning that the Greek electorate stood at a crossroads. Speaking in Chicago after two days of talks with world leaders on the euro crisis, he said: \"We now have to send a very clear message to people in Greece: there is a choice \u2013 you can either vote to stay in the euro, with all the commitments you've made, or if you vote another way, you're effectively voting to leave.\" His remarks are in effect an attempt to make next month's vote a referendum on continued membership of the euro. Cameron indicated he wanted to make the threat of ejection from the euro credible by showing the Greeks that preparations are being made for their departure, a change of tactics after weeks of mixed messages from the European commission on whether such plans are being laid. It is a piece of high-stakes diplomacy since his threat may either anger Greek voters, driving them into the arms of the radical parties, or act as a sobering warning that the end game is truly imminent and renegotiation of the EU-imposed austerity package is not an option. After a meeting of G8 world leaders, the prime minister said of the Greeks: \"They can vote to stay in the eurozone and meet their commitments or they can vote to give up on their commitments and in effect give up on the eurozone. \"I think the point that was very clear from the G8 was that the eurozone has to put in place the most robust contingency plans for both eventualities.\" The thinking of eurozone leaders had been crystallised by the two days of talks, he said. \"The world is suffering from the continued uncertainty in the eurozone.
