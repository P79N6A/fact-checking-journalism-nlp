    "webTitle": "Factories hire more staff amid fastest growth for 20 years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Factories are hiring new staff to keep up with rising demand as Britain's manufacturing output grows at its fastest pace for a generation, according to a closely watched business survey on Tuesday. The report showing factory activity growing ahead of expectations in June and at its fastest pace for seven months \u2013 with output in the second quarter increasing at the fastest pace for 20 years \u2013 helped lift the pound to its highest level since the onset of the financial crisis. Separate figures showed output per worker and output per hour fell in the first quarter, raising questions over the sustainability of economic growth and dampening prospects that wage growth will recover. Financial markets focused on the manufacturing report, however, and the pound gained about 0.25% to $1.7162, the highest level since the autumn of 2008. Sterling was helped against the dollar by a US report on manufacturing that missed expectations. Traders said the latest evidence that the UK's recovery was becoming more broad-based increased the chances that the Bank of England will raise interest rates before the end of the year from their record low of 0.5%. In the UK the headline index on the Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 57.5 from 57 in May. That was well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and ahead of forecasts for a fall to 56.8 in a Reuters poll of economists. The business survey also showed domestic and overseas orders picking up and hiring at a 39-month high. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said the poll signalled official figures on manufacturing would show growth had accelerated in recent months. \"The overall expansion in the sector appears to be broad-based, while rising new orders and optimism amongst firms should help to sustain the current renaissance in business investment and encourage firms to take on more staff,\" he said. The survey also boded well for the economy's wider growth prospects, Beck added, predicting a pick-up from GDP growth of 0.8% in the first quarter. \"June's PMI adds to other evidence that GDP growth may have picked up pace in the second quarter. We expect a quarterly expansion of around 1%, which would be the highest rate since 2007,\" he said. But while signs that manufacturing was finally climbing back up to its pre-crisis strength after being hit hard in the recession were welcomed, official data on productivity was viewed as less upbeat. The Office for National Statistics said output per worker and output per hour slipped 0.1% in the first quarter of this year. Compared with a year earlier, output per worker was up 0.6% and output per hour was up 0.4%. Both measures are well below their pre-crisis peaks. Economists and Bank of England policymakers have been puzzled over why productivity in the UK has not recovered faster. There have been questions over whether the lost productivity will be regained as the economy recovers \u2013 in other words the shortfall is down to cyclical factors \u2013 or whether at least some of the loss is permanent, or down to structural factors. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest figures would add to concern over the UK's poor productivity performance since the crisis. But he was upbeat about the prospects for it to recover. \"We suspect that there is appreciable scope for many companies to ultimately make more use of their existing workforce. We are also hopeful that the recent marked pick-up in business investment will have positive implications for future productivity growth,\" he said. In the nearer term the Work Foundation thinktank warned that flat productivity growth would keep wages subdued. \"There is little scope for many employers to significantly increase wages, and the pressure on living standards, for many in the labour market, will continue,\" said Work Foundation chief economist Ian Brinkley. The UK's manufacturing performance for June was in contrast to the eurozone, where factory activity lost momentum. Markit's eurozone manufacturing PMI dipped to a seven-month low of 51.8, down from 52.2 in May. Factories in France performed worst, with the PMI there dropping to a six-month low of 48.2, showing the manufacturing sector contracting. \"France's manufacturing sector is back in reverse gear and weakness looks set to persist through the summer,\" said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. In the US, the Institute for Supply Management's factory activity index fell to 55.3 in June from 55.4 in May, missing forecasts for a rise to 55.8. The PMI report for China suggested factory activity there grew at its fastest pace for six months in June, in line with market expectations.",

Sterling was helped against the dollar by a US report on manufacturing that missed expectations.</p> <p>Traders said the latest evidence that the UK's recovery was becoming more broad-based increased the chances that the Bank of England will raise interest rates before the end of the year from their record low of 0.5%.</p> <p>In the UK the headline index on the Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 57.5 from 57 in May. That was well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and ahead of forecasts for a fall to 56.8 in a Reuters poll of economists.</p> <p>The business survey also showed domestic and overseas orders picking up and hiring at a 39-month high.</p> <p>Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said the poll signalled official figures on manufacturing would show growth had accelerated in recent months.</p> <p>\"The overall expansion in the sector appears to be broad-based, while rising new orders and optimism amongst firms should help to sustain the current renaissance in business investment and encourage firms to take on more staff,\" he said.</p> <p>The survey also boded well for the economy's wider growth prospects, Beck added, predicting a pick-up from GDP growth of 0.8% in the first quarter.</p> <p>\"June's PMI adds to other evidence that GDP growth may have picked up pace in the second quarter. We expect a quarterly expansion of around 1%, which would be the highest rate since 2007,\" he said.</p> <p>But while signs that manufacturing was finally climbing back up to its pre-crisis strength after being hit hard in the recession were welcomed, official data on productivity was viewed as less upbeat.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said output per worker and output per hour slipped 0.1% in the first quarter of this year. Compared with a year earlier, output per worker was up 0.6% and output per hour was up 0.4%. Both measures are well below their pre-crisis peaks.</p> <p>Economists and Bank of England policymakers have been puzzled over why productivity in the UK has not recovered faster. There have been questions over whether the lost productivity will be regained as the economy recovers \u2013 in other words the shortfall is down to cyclical factors \u2013 or whether at least some of the loss is permanent, or down to structural factors.</p> <p>Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest figures would add to concern over the UK's poor productivity performance since the crisis. But he was upbeat about the prospects for it to recover.</p> <p>\"We suspect that there is appreciable scope for many companies to ultimately make more use of their existing workforce. We are also hopeful that the recent marked pick-up in business investment will have positive implications for future productivity growth,\" he said.</p> <p>In the nearer term the Work Foundation thinktank warned that flat productivity growth would keep wages subdued.</p> <p>\"There is little scope for many employers to significantly increase wages, and the pressure on living standards, for many in the labour market, will continue,\" said Work Foundation chief economist Ian Brinkley.</p> <p>The UK's manufacturing performance for June was in contrast to the eurozone, where factory activity lost momentum.

      "bodyText": "The British arm of lingerie chain La Senza has called in administrators for the second time in two-and-a-half years in a move that could lead to hundreds of job losses. The chain was a franchise so its failure means ownership of the brand reverts to American lingerie giant Limited Brands, which also owns Victoria's Secret. The situation means the retail chain is likely to be broken up with stores sold to rival retailers. La Senza's parent company Marnixheath operated 55 La Senza stores and three Pinkberry outlets in the UK and has 752 employees. The company is thought to have been seeking a buyer for some months but said it had \"decided with regret that there is no alternative to administration\", with PwC appointed on Tuesday. \"Every effort has been made for two and a half years to transform and revitalise the La Senza UK business, but it has continued to experience difficult trading conditions, against the backdrop of a challenging economy and the changing dynamics of the UK retail market,\" said Marnixheath. The company made a loss of \u00a326.2m on sales of \u00a343.3m in 2012 according to the most recent set of accounts filed at Companies House. La Senza's UK business was formerly owned by Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis. He sold the chain, known for its colourful lingerie, to private equity firm Lion Capital in 2006 for \u00a3100m and remained on the board until 2009. But the retailer struggled as the economy got into difficulties and it finally called in administrators in December 2011. It was rescued from administration in 2012 by a division of Kuwaiti retail group Alshaya, which operates franchises for brands including Next and Mothercare as well as Limited Brands. It changed its name from Alshaya UK to Marnixheath in January of this year. Paphitis said the failure of La Senza was \"very sad\" but, having started rival chain Boux Avenue in 2011, he was not interested in rescuing the troubled business. \"I've got a new baby now so it is probably not for us,\" said Paphitis. The Boux Avenue and La Senza store estates overlap in more than 20 locations but the entrepreneur said he would look at stores in places where it was not represented. Robert Moran, joint administrator at PwC, said: \"Like many other retailers, La Senza has been hit hard by the difficult economic environment and a slowdown in consumer spending.\" The North American and other international operations remain unaffected. Moran said there were \"no immediate plans\" to close stores, and the administrators would be holding discussions with interested parties about the potential sale of the business. The 58 store estate includes outlets in Westfield Stratford and Bluewater shopping centre in Kent which are likely to be attractive to other retailers.",

    "webTitle": "Price of groceries rising at lowest rate since 2006", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The price of groceries is rising at its slowest pace since 2006 due to heavy price competition sparked by the rise of the discounters Aldi and Lidl and falling commodity costs. But while shoppers enjoyed a low 0.8% rate of inflation in the 12 weeks to 22 June, there was also good news for retailers as the grocery market picked up the pace of sales growth to 2.8%, according to the latest data released by industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel. The pick-up in trade will be welcome news for food retailers after the market last month recorded its weakest performance in 11 years, with growth falling to 1.7%. However, Fraser McKevitt, consumer insight consultant at Kantar, said the apparent improvement was largely down to the timing of Easter, which boosted the latest figures. \"Underlying it's still a very soft market. The volume [of goods being sold] is flat or growing only slowly and there is an incredibly low inflation environment,\" he said Lower fuel prices, which can play a major part in retailers' overall costs, as well as generally low inflation with the price of staples such as milk and vegetables coming down, are helping retailers bring down prices for shoppers. \"Then there is the price war going on as everybody tries to combat the discounters,\" McKevitt said. All the \"big four\" supermarkets have taken down the price of basics such as milk, bread and eggs as they try to stem the loss of customers to the likes of Aldi and Lidl as well as Poundland and B&amp;M stores. The changing structure of the grocery market was clear to see in the latest figures. Tesco saw its market share dive to 28.9% 1.4 percentage points lower than the same time last year, while Morrisons' sales were down 3.8% as it implemented heavy price cuts. Both Sainsbury's and Asda were able to gain market share but their single-digit pace of growth was far outstripped by discounters. The German chains Aldi and Lidl's sales rose by 35.4% and 22.3% respectively, taking their share of the market to 8.3%, while the Scottish minnow Farmfoods achieved a 23.2% increase in sales. At the upper end of the market, Waitrose also continued to see strong growth with sales 6.9% higher over the three-month period. Waitrose's growth is partly driven by the success of its online business. It sells groceries for home delivery via its own Waitrose.com site and Ocado, the online grocery specialist, which revealed its first ever half-year profit on Tuesday on the back of rising sales and improved efficiency. The company posted a \u00a37.5m pre-tax profit for the 24 weeks to 19 May as sales rose 15.6% to \u00a3442.4m. Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado, brushed aside the achievement. \"It is nice that we have made a profit as it will stop people saying we have never made a profit,\" he said. He added that Ocado was concentrating on building its new joint venture with Morrisons, creating a distribution and IT platform that it could sell as a service to other retailers and increasing sales at the main Ocado site. \"Profit had not been a focus. Our focus is on the enormous opportunity for the future.\" Investors also seemed unimpressed by Ocado's bounce into the black with the shares falling 4.4% to 355p on worries about whether the company could keep up the pace of growth. Although Steiner said Ocado was outperforming its key online grocery competitors over the past six months, he said he expected to grow only \"broadly in line with, or slightly ahead of, the online grocery market\", in future. \"For a small group with a skill set that is supposed to be industry leading, why is Ocado not expecting to shoot the industry lights out? Surely, Ocado should be materially beating incumbent store-based operators?\" said Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital stockbrokers. Fears about the pace of growth were fuelled by a slight drop in the amount Ocado's shoppers are spending on each visit. Steiner suggested that fall was almost entirely the result of shoppers spending less on fruit juices as a result of recent publicity about the potentially harmful effect of sugar consumption. But investors also have concerns that Ocado could lose its biggest supplier, Waitrose, as the upmarket grocer develops its own online operation. Ocado's contract with Waitrose is due to expire in September 2020, but both sides have the option to terminate the agreement from March 2017, with an 18-month notice period. Steiner brushed aside such concerns as \"entirely speculation\" and shrugged off suggestions that any divorce would be bad news for Ocado. \"I don't lose any sleep around it at all. Our customers expect high quality groceries from us and they will get them whether it is from Waitrose or not,\" he said. Farmers' beefs Farmers, retailers and meat processors met the farming minister George Eustice on Tuesday amid concerns about the falling price of British beef. Since the beginning of this year the price of a prime beef carcass has dived by between 15% and 20% as more British meat has come on to the market and imports have risen. Last year the price of British beef soared as poor weather raised feed prices and held back the growth of cattle, just as demand for home-grown meat rose dramatically as shoppers looked for a trustworthy source in the wake of the horsemeat scandal. This year farmers are struggling to cover their costs as all those factors have gone into reverse. Better weather has helped produce heavier beef cattle and there is a cyclical pick-up in the number of animals coming on to the market, while imports are on the rise despite retailers' promises to source more home-grown meat in the wake of the horsemeat scandal. But shoppers are still shying away from some beef-based ready meals after horsemeat was found in some hamburgers and other pre-prepared dishes last year. With cash still tight for most shoppers, they were also put off beef by its relatively high price late last year. Paul Heyhoe, a senior analyst at the beef trade body AHDB/Eblex said only meat from named native breeds such as Aberdeen Angus appeared to be bucking the trend. \"The fundamental thing is that there is a lack of profitability in the industry even at the higher prices we saw last year,\" he said. \"Farmers can spend three years producing animals without any contract so when they bring it to market they have to take what the market is giving.\" Eustice said he had encouraged food processors to begin labelling ready-made meals containing beef so that shoppers knew when they were buying British sausages or hamburgers. He said the government was also working with Eblex on improving export markets for beef producers to help them combat cyclical rises and falls in the UK market for beef. He said: \"There are reall challenges farmers are facing at the moment.\"",

All the \"big four\" supermarkets have taken down the price of basics such as milk, bread and eggs as they try to stem the loss of customers to the likes of Aldi and Lidl as well as Poundland and B&amp;M stores.</p> <p>The changing structure of the grocery market was clear to see in the latest figures. Tesco saw its market share dive to 28.9% 1.4 percentage points lower than the same time last year, while Morrisons' sales were down 3.8% as it implemented heavy price cuts.</p> <p>Both Sainsbury's and Asda were able to gain market share but their single-digit pace of growth was far outstripped by discounters. The German chains Aldi and Lidl's sales rose by 35.4% and 22.3% respectively, taking their share of the market to 8.3%, while the Scottish minnow Farmfoods achieved a 23.2% increase in sales.</p> <p>At the upper end of the market, Waitrose also continued to see strong growth with sales 6.9% higher over the three-month period.</p> <p>Waitrose's growth is partly driven by the success of its online business. It sells groceries for home delivery via its own Waitrose.com site and Ocado, the online grocery specialist, which revealed its first ever half-year profit on Tuesday on the back of rising sales and improved efficiency.</p> <p>The company posted a \u00a37.5m pre-tax profit for the 24 weeks to 19 May as sales rose 15.6% to \u00a3442.4m. Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado, brushed aside the achievement. \"It is nice that we have made a profit as it will stop people saying we have never made a profit,\" he said.</p> <p>He added that Ocado was concentrating on building its new joint venture with Morrisons, creating a distribution and IT platform that it could sell as a service to other retailers and increasing sales at the main Ocado site. \"Profit had not been a focus. Our focus is on the enormous opportunity for the future.\"</p> <p>Investors also seemed unimpressed by Ocado's bounce into the black with the shares falling 4.4% to 355p on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/jul/01/ocado-profit-questions-waitrose\" title=\"\">worries about whether the company could keep up the pace of growth</a>. Although Steiner said Ocado was outperforming its key online grocery competitors over the past six months, he said he expected to grow only \"broadly in line with, or slightly ahead of, the online grocery market\", in future.</p> <p>\"For a small group with a skill set that is supposed to be industry leading, why is Ocado not expecting to shoot the industry lights out? Surely, Ocado should be materially beating incumbent store-based operators?\" said Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital stockbrokers.</p> <p>Fears about the pace of growth were fuelled by a slight drop in the amount Ocado's shoppers are spending on each visit. Steiner suggested that fall was almost entirely the result of shoppers spending less on fruit juices as a result of recent publicity about the potentially harmful effect of sugar consumption.</p> <p>But investors also have concerns that Ocado could lose its biggest supplier, Waitrose, as the upmarket grocer develops its own online operation. Ocado's contract with Waitrose is due to expire in September 2020, but both sides have the option to terminate the agreement from March 2017, with an 18-month notice period.</p> <p>Steiner brushed aside such concerns as \"entirely speculation\" and shrugged off suggestions that any divorce would be bad news for Ocado.</p> <p>\"I don't lose any sleep around it at all. Our customers expect high quality groceries from us and they will get them whether it is from Waitrose or not,\" he said.</p> <h2><strong>Farmers' beefs</strong></h2> <p>Farmers, retailers and meat processors met the farming minister George Eustice on Tuesday amid concerns about the falling price of British beef.</p> <p>Since the beginning of this year the price of a prime beef carcass has dived by between 15% and 20% as more British meat has come on to the market and imports have risen.</p> <p>Last year the price of British beef soared as poor weather raised feed prices and held back the growth of cattle, just as demand for home-grown meat rose dramatically as shoppers looked for a trustworthy source in the wake of the horsemeat scandal.</p> <p>This year farmers are struggling to cover their costs as all those factors have gone into reverse. Better weather has helped produce heavier beef cattle and there is a cyclical pick-up in the number of animals coming on to the market, while imports are on the rise despite retailers' promises to source more home-grown meat in the wake of the horsemeat scandal.</p> <p>But shoppers are still shying away from some beef-based ready meals after horsemeat was found in some hamburgers and other pre-prepared dishes last year. With cash still tight for most shoppers, they were also put off beef by its relatively high price late last year.</p> <p>Paul Heyhoe, a senior analyst at the beef trade body AHDB/Eblex said only meat from named native breeds such as Aberdeen Angus appeared to be bucking the trend. \"The fundamental thing is that there is a lack of profitability in the industry even at the higher prices we saw last year,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Farmers can spend three years producing animals without any contract so when they bring it to market they have to take what the market is giving.\"</p> <p>Eustice said he had encouraged food processors to begin labelling ready-made meals containing beef so that shoppers knew when they were buying British sausages or hamburgers.</p> <p>He said the government was also working with Eblex on improving export markets for beef producers to help them combat cyclical rises and falls in the UK market for beef. He said: \"There are reall challenges farmers are facing at the moment.\"</p>",

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece\u2019s super-rich have joined the ranks of those traditionally benefiting from the tourist sector as record numbers of foreign visitors flock to the country at the epicenter of Europe\u2019s debt crisis.</p> <p>Wealthy Greeks, hit by staggering property taxes and duties on luxury cars and yachts, have begun renting out their high-end summer homes. Photographers hired to shoot the properties have reported a surge in business. So, too, has the Tourism Ministry now been at the receiving end of hundreds of requests for rent permits (as the affluent, perhaps driven by the fear of being turned in by envious neighbours, decide to go legitimate). Media reports suggest that the Greek National Tourism Organization has to date issued 1,800 such licenses \u2013 the vast majority for super-luxury villas \u2013 with hundreds of applications for others still outstanding.</p> <p>\u201cOwners of luxury homes rented out to tourists for the summer season \u2026 are expected to see a turnover in the area of \u20ac100m this years, with conservative estimates bringing tax revenues from such activity to \u20ac20m at least,\u201d wrote the Greek daily Kathimerini on its English language site.</p> <p>Requests for permits on the southern island of Crete shot up from 35 last year to 389 in the first five months of 2014. In the Cycladic islands, requests have jumped from 29 in 2013 to 526 in the same period.</p> <p>Greek tax offices had vowed to crack down on illegal rentals, especially on islands, seeing the activity as a particularly egregious source of tax evasion. Super-luxury homes are rented out for as much as \u20ac10,000 a week on some islands with owners often \u201cfailing\u201d to declare the income.</p> <p>Greece is expecting a record-breaking 19 million tourists this year (21.2 million including visitors on cruise ships). The arrivals are almost double the entire Greek population, with the growing demand for luxury accommodation being seen as a godsend for the well-heeled.</p> <p>Nearly five years into its worst crisis in modern times, with the middle class all but decimated, rich Greeks are increasingly complaining that they, too, are being hit by the relentless austerity measures the country has been compelled to enforce in return for rescue funds from its triumphirate of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d66ea647-d683-409b-ab41-619c277682f7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404221721793/4eade843-f5ee-41fa-9029-ffd95a8d1146-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Tourists visiting Hadrian's Library beneath Athens' ancient Acropolis.\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists visiting Hadrian's Library beneath Athens' ancient Acropolis.

Consequently, the June US manufacturing ISM reading, that was down only 0.1 points from the previous month, but remains at a heady level of 55.3, has to be viewed as a good result, even if it was lower than expectations \u2013 since the expectations themselves will always be of pretty low value.</p> <p>Such a headline manufacturing ISM figure is consistent with GDP growth of 3.5%, and in all likelihood, the US will grow a good deal faster than that in the second quarter of 2014, following the execrable first quarter GDP result. Moreover, there is some merit in taking greater comfort from the (forward looking) rising orders component of this series, than the production (current) series, which fell marginally.<br></p> <p>The only other notable features of the survey were 1) the softer prices paid component, which is at odds with recent inflation data, and trends in energy process, but if believable, takes pressure off the Fed to speed up the taper. Secondly, the rival Markit manufacturing PMI released 15 minutes prior to this release, and showing a fairly large rise, still has question marks over it. Until Markit\u2019s series starts to give consistent directional signals to the longer and more watched ISM series, it is going to struggle to gain market acceptance.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53b2c0ade4b03dc0a41b221e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-01T14:13:30.713Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Mixed signals from the US economy</b>.

There are two schools of thought about the UK, one optimistic and one pessimistic. The upbeat view says that most of the recent fall in productivity has been caused by a combination of under-reporting of activity and of cyclical factors. There is, for example, some evidence that estate agencies kept on their staff during the slump in the property market because they wanted to grab what little business there was. An increase in housing transactions should see productivity of estate agents pick up.</p> <p>But this pick-up in cyclical productivity is long overdue and the delay inevitably raises questions \u2013 not least at the Bank of England \u2013 about whether there are structural factors at play.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/jul/01/manufacturing-data-industry-strong-pound\">Manufacturing data shows how well industry has coped with strong pound</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53b2a13fe4b0ae8c3002e47d\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-01T12:39:26.742Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of England reveals eurozone crisis contingency planning</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cd974d86-22f4-4f59-b353-fed997e46678\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404218099518/051f40b6-5508-4e1f-a83e-75cbfce2fb3b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The columns of the Bank of England in the City of London, May 19, 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The columns of the Bank of England.

Against that backdrop, it thought that HM Treasury should prepare for a full range of eventualities; in some especially severe scenarios, far-reaching solutions might be required and some members felt that these should extend to the potential write-down of some private sector holdings of bank debt. </p> </blockquote> <p>Such bail-in powers hadn't been used in 2011 -- at that stage, governments were still putting the burden of bank recapitalisations on the taxpayer.

This report showed important signs that this recovery borne on the shaky ground of debt-fuelled consumption is starting to trickle through to all sectors of the economy and look truly sustainable.</p> </blockquote> <p>With exports and domestic demand strong, the PMI report suggests the UK economy may be rebalancing a little more towards manufacturing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cA surging manufacturing sector will provide reassurance to the doves at the Bank of England that this recovery is becoming more resilient and will harden the hawks\u2019 position that the UK is ready for the first rate hike.

The Chinese figures lifted mining shares, while there was also a positive response to BNP Paribas paying a near $9bn fine to settle charges it violated US sanctions. The final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 58.98 points or 0.87% at 6802.92 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.71% to 9902.41 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.87% higher at 4461.12 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 1.32% better at 21,563.43 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 0.77% to 11,007.8 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 128 points or 0.76% higher. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Over to Greece where ever growing numbers are cashing in on record tourism arrivals. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Greece\u2019s super-rich have joined the ranks of those traditionally benefiting from the tourist sector as record numbers of foreign visitors flock to the country at the epicenter of Europe\u2019s debt crisis. Wealthy Greeks, hit by staggering property taxes and duties on luxury cars and yachts, have begun renting out their high-end summer homes. Photographers hired to shoot the properties have reported a surge in business. So, too, has the Tourism Ministry now been at the receiving end of hundreds of requests for rent permits (as the affluent, perhaps driven by the fear of being turned in by envious neighbours, decide to go legitimate). Media reports suggest that the Greek National Tourism Organization has to date issued 1,800 such licenses \u2013 the vast majority for super-luxury villas \u2013 with hundreds of applications for others still outstanding. \u201cOwners of luxury homes rented out to tourists for the summer season \u2026 are expected to see a turnover in the area of \u20ac100m this years, with conservative estimates bringing tax revenues from such activity to \u20ac20m at least,\u201d wrote the Greek daily Kathimerini on its English language site. Requests for permits on the southern island of Crete shot up from 35 last year to 389 in the first five months of 2014. In the Cycladic islands, requests have jumped from 29 in 2013 to 526 in the same period. Greek tax offices had vowed to crack down on illegal rentals, especially on islands, seeing the activity as a particularly egregious source of tax evasion. Super-luxury homes are rented out for as much as \u20ac10,000 a week on some islands with owners often \u201cfailing\u201d to declare the income. Greece is expecting a record-breaking 19 million tourists this year (21.2 million including visitors on cruise ships). The arrivals are almost double the entire Greek population, with the growing demand for luxury accommodation being seen as a godsend for the well-heeled. Nearly five years into its worst crisis in modern times, with the middle class all but decimated, rich Greeks are increasingly complaining that they, too, are being hit by the relentless austerity measures the country has been compelled to enforce in return for rescue funds from its triumphirate of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said the ISM result was a good one despite the dip: There is quite a lot of volatility in the ISM indices, and almost no information in the regional surveys that precede it. Consequently, the June US manufacturing ISM reading, that was down only 0.1 points from the previous month, but remains at a heady level of 55.3, has to be viewed as a good result, even if it was lower than expectations \u2013 since the expectations themselves will always be of pretty low value. Such a headline manufacturing ISM figure is consistent with GDP growth of 3.5%, and in all likelihood, the US will grow a good deal faster than that in the second quarter of 2014, following the execrable first quarter GDP result. Moreover, there is some merit in taking greater comfort from the (forward looking) rising orders component of this series, than the production (current) series, which fell marginally. The only other notable features of the survey were 1) the softer prices paid component, which is at odds with recent inflation data, and trends in energy process, but if believable, takes pressure off the Fed to speed up the taper. Secondly, the rival Markit manufacturing PMI released 15 minutes prior to this release, and showing a fairly large rise, still has question marks over it. Until Markit\u2019s series starts to give consistent directional signals to the longer and more watched ISM series, it is going to struggle to gain market acceptance. Mixed signals from the US economy. The country's manufacturing growth was virtually static in June, confounding expectations of a slight improvement, according to the Institute of Supply Management. The ISM index of factory activity was 55.3 last month, compared to 55.4 in May and forecasts of an increase to 55.8. But the rival Markit report showed its final manufacturing PMI climbing to 57.3 in June, the highest reading since May 2010. The report showed the fastest growth in output and new orders since April 2010. Meanwhile construction spending rose 0.1% in May, according to the Commerce Department, lower than the expected 0.5% increase. GM's recent headlines all seem to be about recalling millions of vehicles for various faults. But that does not seem to have stopped its sales rising in June. Total sales rose 1% with retail sales up the same amount and fleet sales up 2%. Ford sales, in contrast, fell 6%. Twitter has a new CEO - Anthony Noto, the former managing director of Goldman Sachs. But Noto's not just any Goldmanite - he's the man who led Twitter's stock market flotation last year. And he sounds terribly chuffed about the move: And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. A new flurry of manufacturing data is being released -- and the news from Brazil isn't great. Conditions in the Brazilian factory sector deteriorated at the sharpest pace since July 2013, HSBC and Markit reports. Its manufacturing PMI fell from 48.8 in May to 48.7 in June, so deeper into contraction territory (below the 50-point mark). Output shrank at its fastest rate in 33 months, while firms also reported a drop in new orders. Football gets some of the blame: Survey participants reported weaker domestic demand, which was partly linked to the World Cup. But Andre Loes, HSBC's chief economist for Brazil, warns there are also signs its economy is slowing. Don't miss economics editor Larry Elliott's analysis of today's strong UK manufacturing figures, and the latest drop in productivity. Here's a flavour: Productivity matters, because it is by getting more efficient that living standards increase. There are two schools of thought about the UK, one optimistic and one pessimistic. The upbeat view says that most of the recent fall in productivity has been caused by a combination of under-reporting of activity and of cyclical factors. There is, for example, some evidence that estate agencies kept on their staff during the slump in the property market because they wanted to grab what little business there was. An increase in housing transactions should see productivity of estate agents pick up. But this pick-up in cyclical productivity is long overdue and the delay inevitably raises questions \u2013 not least at the Bank of England \u2013 about whether there are structural factors at play. Manufacturing data shows how well industry has coped with strong pound This will interest eurozone crisis-watchers. The Bank of England has revealed details of the planning that took place three years ago to protect the UK economy from the crisis unfolding in the euro area. And it shows that the BoE urged the Treasury to consider a range of \"far-reaching solutions\", including imposing losses on investors who held bonds issued by UK banks. Today's report explains: In September 2011, the Committee made an initially private recommendation to HM Treasury that its contingency planning should be as comprehensive as possible and include arrangements for recapitalisation, and the restructuring of bank liabilities in circumstances in which their survival was threatened. At the time of making this recommendation, the interim Committee had been concerned that conditions in Europe could deteriorate rapidly, with the potential to impact across global financial markets. Against that backdrop, it thought that HM Treasury should prepare for a full range of eventualities; in some especially severe scenarios, far-reaching solutions might be required and some members felt that these should extend to the potential write-down of some private sector holdings of bank debt. Such bail-in powers hadn't been used in 2011 -- at that stage, governments were still putting the burden of bank recapitalisations on the taxpayer. But that changed with the Cyprus crisis, and new European rules mean that bond-holders would be in the firing line before government. And that's why the information is now being public -- bank bond holders know that they would be hit with losses the next time a bank needs help. Here's City Editor Jill Treanor's take: Bank of England asked for contingency plan during height of eurozone crisis Here's our news story on the Port Talbot job cuts: Tata Steel to cut 400 jobs in Wales The news that UK manufacturing activity has hit a seven-month high (details at 9.39am) raises the chances of someone at the Bank of England voting to raise interest rates this summer. So reckons Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe. Here's her take: \u201cThe June Manufacturing PMI supported the Bank of England\u2019s claims that the UK recovery shows no signs of slowing down. The recovery began on household consumption and a housing market boom that contrasted dangerously with virtually zero real wage growth and rising household debt. This report showed important signs that this recovery borne on the shaky ground of debt-fuelled consumption is starting to trickle through to all sectors of the economy and look truly sustainable. With exports and domestic demand strong, the PMI report suggests the UK economy may be rebalancing a little more towards manufacturing: \u201cA surging manufacturing sector will provide reassurance to the doves at the Bank of England that this recovery is becoming more resilient and will harden the hawks\u2019 position that the UK is ready for the first rate hike. The first vote for rate hikes should come in July or August with the first increase before the year is out.\u201d Michael McKee of Bloomberg has rounded up this morning's factory data in three pithy tweets: (full coverage starts at 8.12am, with lots of graphs and key points) The unions at Port Talbot appear to accept the argument that job cuts are needed at the steelworks. But they also point out that the Welsh workforce have been through some tough years since the financial crisis broke. Alan Coombs, who chairs the Multi Unions committee, said: \u201cIt is vital that this business remains competitive in all market conditions. We will be working closely with the business for the benefit of its employees and to help develop a sustainable future. \u201cIn the course of the prolonged economic downturn, employees have made sacrifices to sustain the business. With this in mind, we will be working with the company to ensure that a positive outcome is achieved for employees who may be looking to leave the business.\u201d Hundreds of jobs are being lost at the Port Talbot steelworks in South Wales. Tata Steel, which owns the site, announced it is restructuring its operations in a bid to \"improve the competitiveness\" of the site. Karl Koehler, Tata Steel\u2019s European chief executive, blamed tough competition in the steel market. The proposed changes will reduce \"costs equivalent to the loss of about 400 jobs\". A consultation process with staff and unions, which will take more than 45 days, will begin \"soon\". Tata has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on new equipment at the site, which chancellor George Osborne visited three months ago: Tata argues that it must now cut the workforce to stay competitive: \u201cWe have invested more than \u00a3250 million over the last two years in state-of-the-art steelmaking technology in the Strip Products business. In addition, we are currently investing in our Hot Strip Mill in Port Talbot and we have upgraded our galvanising line in Llanwern enabling us to increase production of high-value automotive steels. \u201cThese investments have created a stronger, more efficient and more reliable platform from which we can meet the needs of our customers, with an improved range and quality of products and services. \u201cBut steel demand and prices are likely to be under pressure for some years. Our business rates in the UK are much higher than other EU countries\u2019 and our UK energy costs will remain uncompetitive until new mitigation measures come into effect. The news comes as new figures show that UK productivity has fallen again, with output-per-hour down 0.1% in the first three months of 2014. And it won't come as a shock to hear that Europe still has a youth unemployment problem. Some progress has been made in the last year. Today's data shows that youth unemployment decreased by 464 000 in the European Union and by 205 000 in the euro area over the last 12 months. That means there are still 5.187 million under-25s unemployed in the EU28, of whom 3.356 million were in the euro area. The worst rates are in Greece (57.7% in March 2014), Spain (54.0%) and new boy Croatia (48.7% in the first quarter of 2014) But it was a brighter picture in Germany (7.8%), Austria (8.9%) and the Netherlands (10.8%). Politics analyst Alberto Nardelli has tweeted the key chart. As usual, the eurozone jobless data shows the stark difference between member states. Austria kept the crown of being the country with the lowest rate, at 4.7%, followed by Germany and Malta. The highest rates were, again, measured in Greece (26.8% in March 2014) and Spain (25.1%). Eurostat adds: Compared with a year ago, the unemployment rate fell in twenty one Member States, increased in six and remained stable in Austria. The largest decreases were registered in Hungary (10.5% to 7.9% between April 2013 and April 2014), Portugal (16.9% to 14.3%) and Ireland (13.9% to 12.0%), and the highest increases in Luxembourg (5.8% to 6.3%), Italy (12.1% to 12.6%), Finland (8.1% to 8.5%) and the Netherlands (6.6% to 7.0%). According to Eurostat, there were 18.552 million people of work in the eurozone in May, which means 28,000 people found a job during the month. Over the last year, unemployment is down by 636,000 -- which underlines that many millions of people have not yet benefitted from the recovery. Across the EU, unemployment has fallen by 1.361 million in the last year, to 24.184m people. The unemployment rate across the wider EU fell to 10.3% in May, down from 10.4% in April. This chart shows how the eurozone unemployment rate has been slowly falling since the summer of 2013: Just in: The Eurozone unemployment rate was 11.6% in May. And April's reading has been revised down from the initial reading of 11.7%. That's still close to recent highs, showing that the recovery has made little impact on the jobless levels so far. More to follow Speaking of the Bank of England, the minutes of the Financial Policy Committee's last meeting have just been released (online here) This is the meeting where the FPC shied away from a clampdown on the housing market right now, but told banks that at least 85% of their loans must be below 4.5x loan-to-income (LTI) ratios. The minutes show that the FPC had a range of views about this issue. Some saw merit in imposing a lower loan-to-income limit, but allowing more mortgages over that level. Others suggested a higher LTI cap, but with less riskier lending allowed. To the extent that there was a risk that the market might see whatever threshold chosen as one that the Committee \u2018endorsed\u2019 as sound from an underwriting perspective, there was also a benefit in choosing a lower threshold. On balance, the Committee agreed that it would set the policy by restricting the flow of lending at very high LTIs. The pound has soared on the back of the UK manufacturing data -- hitting $1.7132 against the US dollar. That's the strongest rate since October 2008, as traders bet that the Bank of England is going to raise interest rates before the end of the year (despite governor Mark Carney's concerns about productivity and wage growth) Back to the manufacturing data -- and the UK has reported another blowout number. The UK factory PMI jumped to a seven-month high of 57.5 in June -- showing that growth accelerated from the already strong 57.0 recorded in May. Key points: \uf0a7 Order inflows strengthen as demand improves in domestic and export markets \uf0a7 Job creation at 39-month high, led by rising headcounts among small firms Markit and CIPS, who compile the data, report: The level of incoming new business rose at the fastest pace since November 2013 and to one of the greatest extents since the survey began in 1992. The domestic market remained the prime source of new contract wins, although inflows of new export business also strengthened. It suggests the UK economy continued to grow at a healthy rate in the last quarter: German unemployment rose unexpectedly for the second month in a row in June, the Labour Office said this morning. On a seasonally adjusted basis, unemployment jumped by 9,000 to 2.916m, dashing predictions of a 10,000 decline. The jobless rate was steady at 6.7 percent. The rise is partly due to the mild weather during the winter -- which allowed construction firms to keep staff on. Thus, we aren't seeing the usual bounce-back in seasonally adjusted unemployment. Reminder, we get the eurozone unemployment data in just under 30 minutes Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, is worried that today's data shows the eurozone recovery is losing momentum: Here's his take: \u201cThere are encouraging signs of growth gathering momentum in the region\u201fs \"periphery\u201f, especially in Spain and Ireland, and some of the slowdown in Germany may have been due to a high number of public holidays. But the overall picture is a reminder of just how fragile the region\u201fs recovery is looking. \u201cEmployment is barely rising in the manufacturing sector as companies worry about waning growth of new orders, which reflects very subdued demand for goods from households and businesses. And if the recovery keeps slowing down, the European Central Bank will face more calls for embark on a full-blown bond-buying (quantitative easing) programme. And the upshot of all this morning's data is that the eurozone's manufacturing recovery has slowed last month, with France taking the blame. Markit's Eurozone Manufacturing PMI dipped to a seven-month low of 51.8, down from 52.2 in the prior month -- a worrying sign. It shows that growth slowed, with the PMI dipping back towards the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. Spain's strongest performance in seven years (details) and the surge in Irish new orders (details) couldn't make up for the contraction in France (details) and slower growth in Germany and the Netherlands. Markit, which compiled the data, warned that domestic market conditions remained generally subdued. And new exports, which had driven the recovery recently, rose at the least marked pace for almost a year. These charts give more details: Now this is disappointing - Greece's factory sector has suffered a fresh contraction, reversing the welcome revival seen in May. Its factory PMY fell to a seven-month low of 49.4, indicating a contraction, down from 51 (small growth) in May. Firms reported a drop in new orders. And finally Germany -- and growth in its factory sector has dipped. The German manufacturing PMI fell to 52, down from 52.4. That still shows expansion, but at the slowest rate since October 2013. It looks like demand tailed off a little, after a strong start to the year, with output and new orders slowing. And the strength of the euro may be a factor. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, comments: \u201cJune\u2019s survey results pointed to slower growth in Germany\u2019s goods producing sector with the headline PMI falling to an eight-month low. Output and new order growth continued to slow, which our panel members in many cases linked to production adjustments after strong growth had been reported at the beginning of the year. \u201cIn line with the weaker trends for output and new orders, companies were reluctant to take on additional workers during June, thereby ending a six-month period of continuous job creation. \u201cMeanwhile, client demand from foreign markets rose to the weakest extent in the current spell of growth, suggesting that a relatively strong euro is acting as a drag on stronger export growth and may continue to do so in coming months.\u201d There's more bad news for France, though -- its manufacturing PMI has fallen to a six-month low as activity declined at a faster rate. The final French PMI dropped to 48.2 this month -- down from 49.6 in May, which means that business conditions have deteriorated at the fastest rate so far this year. Markit reports that production volumes and new orders from abroad fell, which led to a pick-up in job cuts. Some firms also suggested that \"worries about the outlook for client spending\" had also led them to cut workforce numbers. Tim Moore, Senior Economist at Markit, says the report paints a worrying picture for Europe's second largest economy: \u201cFrance\u2019s manufacturing sector is back in reverse gear and weakness looks set to persist through the summer. Deteriorating business conditions were reflected in cuts to production levels for the first time in five months and the fastest reduction in new orders so far this year. June\u2019s survey pointed to weakening demand from both domestic and export clients, which in turn placed further downwards pressure on factory gate charges. \u201cSqueezed operating margins and a return to falling output volumes contributed to the steepest pace of manufacturing job shedding since the end of 2013.\u201d Now it's Italy's turn....and growth in its factory sector has dropped to a three- month low. The Italian manufacturing PMI, tracking activity across the sector, came in at 52.6 in June, down from 53.2 in May. That still shows \"a further improvement in the general health of Italy\u2019s manufacturing sector\" (as it's over the 50-point mark). But both output and new orders rose at a slower rate. The good news, though, is that Italian manufacturers still kept hiring more workers. Phil Smith, economist at Markit, doesn't sound too worried: \u201cThe manufacturing sector made significant gains in the second quarter, as highlighted by the headline PMI posting it highest quarterly average for more than three years. Output growth eased in June but was nevertheless solid and led businesses to raise employment again, with the current run of jobs growth in the sector the longest since 2007.\" The report also show that cost inflation picked up -- however strong competition meant factories weren't able to pass those higher costs onto customers. Growth in the Czech Republic's factory sector has eased last month -- with the PMI dropping to 54.7 from 57.3. That still shows a rise in activity, but at a lower rate. Spain's factory sector has grown at the fastest rate since before the financial crisis. The monthly manufacturing PMI survey has shown a sharp jump in output, new orders and (crucially) employment in June. It jumped to 54.6 in June, up from 52.9 in May. That level hasn't been seen since the financial crisis began in 2007. And factories took on extra staff at a faster pace during June, with the rate of job creation sharper than at any point since the global financial crisis. It suggests that Spain's economic recovery from the trauma of the eurozone crisis is continuing. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, argued that Spain's factory workers are outperforming their footballers. \u201cIn contrast to the disappointing results for \"La Roja\u201f in Brazil, the performance of the Spanish manufacturing sector provided plenty of encouragement in June. Sharp rises in output and new orders were recorded, while the rate of job creation picked up to its strongest since mid-2007. This all added up to the strongest monthly improvement in the health of the sector for seven years. Adding to positive signs was a second successive monthly rise in output prices as client demand strengthens.\u201d Growth in Dutch factory sector has eased last month, pulled back by subdued domestic demand. Markit reports that the Dutch manufacturing PMI came in at 52.3 in June, down from 53.6 in May to its lowest level since July 2013. Growth in new orders slowed, despite healthy demand from overseas. Markit reports: The main factor underlying the slower rate of increase in new orders was subdued domestic demand. In contrast, strong gains in new export orders were registered at Dutch manufacturers, with foreign demand improving at the fastest pace since February Manufacturing conditions have deteriorated in Turkey, dragging its factory sector into a small contraction this month. The monthly PMI survey, from HSBC, shows that: Output, new orders, exports, backlogs and purchasing activity all declined during the month. Employment in the sector continued to rise, but at a rate unchanged from May\u2019s 22-month low. Input price inflation remained sharp, linked to the weak lira, but slowed for the fifth successive month from January\u2019s peak to the weakest since May 2013. This pulled the Turkish PMI down to 48.8 in June, from 50.1 in May. That's the first sub-50 reading (showing contraction) since July 2013. A quick explainer -- the PMI indices are calculated by asking Purchasing Managers at firms around the globe about current conditions (activity, output, employment, orders). This is then used to create a single headline number -- where 50 indicates no change. Anything over 50 shows growth, while 49.9 or lower shows contraction. So, it's \"soft data\" rather than \"hard data\", but generally it's a decent guide to economic conditions right now. Back to the manufacturing data..and Ireland has posted its biggest jump in factory orders in 40 months. The headline manufacturing PMI for Ireland came in at 55.3, up from 55.0 in May -- which means activity rose at a faster rate. Firms reported that they took on more staff, to cope with rising demand. New orders rose at the fastest rate since February 2011, the early months's of Ireland's bailout. Investec reports: The recovery in the Irish manufacturing sector continued at the end of the second quarter of the year as new business growth accelerated during June. Firms used inventories to help fulfil new orders and stocks of finished goods fell solidly as a result. Meanwhile, the rate of expansion in output eased, but remained marked. Cost inflationary pressures were muted again in June, while output prices were raised for the first time in six months. More here. As predicted, BNP's shares have indeed jumped in early trading, up nearly 3.5%: And if you missed it, this was the scene in New York last night as BNP Paribas, pleaded guilty and agreed to pay nearly $9 billion to resolve criminal allegations that it processed transactions for clients in Sudan and other blacklisted countries in violation of U.S. trade sanctions (story here): Traders are predicting that BNP Paribas shares will rise by 2-3% this morning, now that the penalty for sanctions-busting has been agreed. CEO Jean-Laurent Bonnaf\u00e9 also indicated that this year's dividend target is now \u20ac1.50 per share, versus \u20ac2 per share before. There had been speculation that BNP would be forced to freeze the dividend to help cover the $8.9bn fine, but CFO Lars Machenil says its cash reserves mean it has ample liquidity. Here's the key quote from BNP's conference call this morning: \"We deeply regret the past misconduct that led to this settlement,\" \"The failures that have come to light in the course of this investigation run contrary to the principles on which BNP Paribas has always sought to operate.\" Over in Paris, French bank BNP Paribas is holding a press conference to discuss last night's $8.9bn fine for breaking US sanctions over trade with Sudan, Iran and Cuba. Chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnaf\u00e9 begins telling analysts and journalists that the penalty does not threaten BNP's financial stability. With the settlement now agreed, he says, BNP can full focus on implementing its financial plans. Bonnaf\u00e9 also thanks clients, employees and shareholders for their recent support. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has helpfully rounded up the City forecasts for today's eurozone manufacturing reports, due over the next few hours. With a big week of data coming up starting today, investors are looking for further evidence of an underpinning of recovery in China, the US, as well as the UK, and hoping that the situation in Europe doesn't lose too much of its early momentum from the first part of this year. This morning\u2019s Chinese manufacturing PMI numbers have got the day off to a fairly positive start, coming in at 51, in line with expectations for the official measure, and 50.7 for the HSBC measure, which missed expectations. China factory activity hits multi-month highs, economy steadying Back to Hewson: Today's final manufacturing PMI's for June from Italy, Spain, France and Germany are set to show that while Italy and Spain are starting to show some signs of optimism with rising PMI's, the economies of France and Germany are continuing to diverge, with French manufacturing PMI set to be confirmed at 47.8, while Germany is set to remain at 52.4. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. It's a new month, and that means it's a big day for manufacturing data. Surveys from across the globe will show how factories performed in June -- and they'll be pored over for signs of whether the global recovery continued. And in Europe, we're likely see confirmation that Germany and France continue to diverge. We also get the latest unemployment data for May from across the eurozone -- which will probably show limited progress in tackling the jobless crisis. We'll also be tracking the fallout from BNP Paribas's record $8.9bn fine for sanction-busting, agreed in the US last night. BNP Paribas pleads guilty to criminal charges in sanctions case In the corporate sector, results from Ocado and Greggs will show how UK consumers are behaving. Not expecting any drama in the European stock markets though, after Japan's market ended higher: And I'll also keep an eye on Bulgaria's banking sector, which received aid from the EC yesterday.",

Supermarkets were under pressure as discount rivals continued to gain ground on the major players. Morrisons fell 3.2p to 180.2p and J Sainsbury slipped 1.4p to 314.1p. Tesco dipped 0.05p to 284.15p. Morrisons partner Ocado slumped 16.3p to 355p on concerns it cannot keep up the growth rate, despite the online retailer making a half year profit of \u00a37.5m before one off items, compared to a \u00a31m loss this time last year. But touted takeover target Diageo continued to be in demand, up 36.5p at 1902.5p Among the mid-caps, property group St Modwen Properties climbed 12.5p to 371.1p after a 32% rise in half year profits. Serco was 1.8p lower at 363.7p as analysts at Barclays cut their target price on the outsourcing group from 435p to 355p, with the bank suggesting its dividend should be cut. It said: [Serco's] margin upside is significant but might be eroded by downward pressure on revenue growth especially for next year. From a balance sheet perspective Serco's headroom is limited: it may be able to avoid another equity issue, but the dividend looks vulnerable and should be cut, in our view. Our forecasts now reflect recent profit warnings and the equity issue \u2013 we forecast earnings per share of 18.5p this year, rising to 20.2p in 2015 and 24.4p in 2016. The latter compares to the 22p-26p earnings per share thresholds laid out in Serco's recently rebased Performance Share Plan (which rises to 30p-35p by 2018). On this basis Serco trades on 18 times 2015 PE, falling to 15 times 2016 PE, the latter in-line with its average over the last 5 years. This balances margin recovery potential versus revenue and execution risk in our view. Lower down the market, Cyan Holdings closed 25% higher at 0.37p after a consortium including the utility meter and lighting control group won a contract from Tata Power in India for 5,000 smart meters. But mobile commerce group MoPowered slumped 51% to 29.75p after it said contract delays would hit its revenues. Litebulb, the brand development group, added 14% to 0.93p after revealing \u00a31m worth of orders from a number of major retailers. Recent acquisition Go Entertainment will develop a new range of products including books, DVDs and magazines for what is described as \"a major UK retailer.\" The brands involved include the History Channel, Discovery and the Imperial War Museum. Meanwhile Litebulb's Bluw subsidiary has received an order from Debenhams to supply items for its Christmas gift range, and from German retailer Tchibo for Star Wars and Scootrix merchandise. Finally Ilika added 7.5p to 70p as it announced it had increased the energy capacity of its solid state batteries by more than 25 times since January. Numis said: It is clear that the market opportunity for Ilika's battery technology is very large and the development progress is clearly positive. Consumer interest in \"internet-of-things\" devices like \"wearables\" is building as a way of getting further utility out of smartphones/tablets. A key constraint to producing compelling devices however is their need to be highly mobile and thus battery powered. We estimate the wearables/IoT segment represents a $6bn longer term market opportunity, which based on a 30% share and a 2% royalty rate could produce peak annual royalty income of $36m for Ilika from its solid state battery.",

      "bodyText": "At the height of the eurozone crisis the Bank of England warned the Treasury that it needed a comprehensive contingency plan to prop up Britain's banks, documents published by the central bank have revealed. Bank policymakers were so concerned about the potential impact of the turmoil in the eurozone that they told the Treasury its contingency planning should be as wide-ranging as possible. The discussions of the Bank's financial policy committee (FPC) \u2013 set up by the coalition to spot future risks in the financial system \u2013 were not made public in October 2011 for fear of further destabilising the situation. The FPC has decided to release the information now as the eurozone situation is no longer such a cause for concern and new rules are in place to make it easier to resolve troubled banks. \"The committee made an initially private recommendation to HM Treasury that its contingency planning should be as comprehensive as possible and include arrangements for recapitalisation, and the restructuring of bank liabilities in circumstances in which their survival was threatened,\" the FPC said. \"It judged that publishing on 3 October 2011 this recommendation in the record of its meeting would be contrary to the public interest given the risk of further undermining already fragile market sentiment,\" the FPC said on Tuesday, publishing the record of its June meetings. At the time in 2011, the first bailout of Greece was crumbling and fears were mounting about the troubled economies of a number of countries in the eurozone. \"The committee thought that the Treasury should prepare for a full range of eventualities. In some especially severe scenarios, more far-reaching solutions might be required, which some members of the committee felt should extend to the potential writedown of some private-sector holdings of bank debt,\" it added. The latest record also shows there was a detailed debate on the FPC about how to tackle the current situation in the mortgage market. Last week the Bank of England indicated a further 20% rise in house prices by the first quarter of 2017 could be tolerated before measures to cool the market would have any impact. These measures involve preventing mortgage lenders allocating more than 15% of their loans to customers needing to borrow more than four and half times their income \u2013 and ensuring customers were able to maintain their payments if interest rates were to rise to 7%. According to the record of the June meeting, there was a discussion about where the cap on lending should be placed. \"The committee discussed the pros and cons of setting the share limit based on the volume or value of mortgages that banks could extend beyond the LTI threshold. On the one hand, limiting the volume of mortgages extended above the threshold would act directly to limit the proportion of households that could become highly indebted from mortgage borrowing. On the other hand, a values measure would help to capture the fact that any drop in non-mortgage spending in the event of mortgage distress by a high-income household might have a greater impact on aggregate consumption,\" the FPC said. \"The committee recognised that neither measure was ideal in isolation, but that having a dual limit would be complicated. Members therefore to set the policy as limiting the volume of mortgages above the threshold and to ask the PRA in parallel to monitor values of mortgages extended above the threshold,\" the FPC said.",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has announced plans to cut about 400 jobs at its plant in Port Talbot in Wales and is not ruling out compulsory redundancies. The company said the job losses, which cover more than 10% of the workforce at Port Talbot, were needed to reduce costs because of lower demand for steel in Europe. The jobs will go at Tata's strip products business, which produces sheets of steel used to make products such as tin cans, cars, roofing and fridges. A spokesman for Tata said the company could not rule out compulsory redundancies because it needs to cut jobs while keeping hold of workers with specific skills. The company, part of the Indian conglomerate Tata, has started a consultation process that will last at least 45 days with its employees at the site, which employs almost 4,000 workers. Tata Steel has made a series of big job cuts in response to a fall in demand and prices for steel in Europe. It slashed almost 600 jobs in November 2012 at Port Talbot as part of a programme of 900 redundancies in the UK. It cut about 1,500 jobs in Scunthorpe and 100 in Corby the year before. In a statement, Karl-Ulrich K\u00f6hler, Tata Steel's European chief executive, said the company had invested more than \u00a3250m in the strip products business over the last two years but that steel demand and prices would stay under pressure for several years. \"Our business rates in the UK are much higher than other EU countries and our UK energy costs will remain uncompetitive until new mitigation measures come into effect. These proposed changes then are vital if we are to build a competitive future for our strip products business in the UK.\" Unions warned that the cuts should not be allowed to threaten safety at the plant and called on the government to support the steel industry. Roy Rickhuss, who chairs the UK trade unions' steel committee, said: \"We recognise the company has been dealing with a long-term downturn in European steel markets for more than five years. However we have also expressed our own concerns about possible undermanning within strip products and in Port Talbot in particular. \"This news also demonstrates that despite the government's trumpeting of economic recovery, the steel sector remains under real pressure. This sector, vital for so much of British manufacturing, must be an area of real focus for the UK's industrial policy.\" Rickhuss's committee is made up of the Unite, Community and GMB unions.",

Ocado speaks of an 80% increase in EBITDA year on year, which is code for just how low profitability has been for so many years. Management also makes mention of increased price competition and sets out an expectation for its own retail business to grow 'broadly in line with, or slightly ahead of, the online grocery market'. For a small group with a skill set that is supposed to be industry leading, why is Ocado not expecting to shoot the industry lights out? Surely, Ocado should be materially beating incumbent store based operators; if not this undermines a claim for a premium rating, noting as we do that 15.6% gross retail sales was a little underwhelming.  Following this update we are not inclined to adjust our full year financial expectations for Ocado. The business provides a good service but is not a proprietary retailer of any substance to our minds as it still depends upon Waitrose (John Lewis Partnership) and Morrisons. Indeed, in flogging its CFC2 to Morrison's was admittance that Ocado could not compete as a sole player. A CFC3 will expose the weakness of Ocado the retailer to our minds. Third party technical and logistics advice with other retailers at home and abroad may provide an additional revenue stream for Ocado but this is a long way from being a proprietary online player as opposed to a glorified management consultant.  We do not see the business as a disrupter in the UK grocery market because it is irrelevant within the \u00a3175bn industry.
