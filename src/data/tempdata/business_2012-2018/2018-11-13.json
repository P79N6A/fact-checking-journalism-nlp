Staff are unsure of engaging with me so they swerve the conversation altogether.\u201d Tough times on the high street mean the big retail chains are crying out for customers, yet Adams \u2013 the founder of Purple, a not-for-profit organisation that promotes the spending power of the UK\u2019s near 14 million disabled people \u2013 argues that shops are badly serving a \u00a3249bn market. Adams was behind this week\u2019s \u201cPurple Tuesday\u201d, which saw stores and shopping centres festooned in the signature colour of the disability rights movement. Purple\u2019s initial target was to get 50 companies to each make a new long-term commitment to improving the experience of disabled shoppers. But by the time the day itself came around, that figure had reached 700. The event was designed to \u201cdemonstrate to retailers that there are things that can be done at no cost\u201d and to \u201cstart some momentum for businesses to see disabled people as, first and foremost, customers,\u201d says Adams. Asda, Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury\u2019s, as well as Hammerson and LandSec, the owners of shopping malls including the Bullring in Birmingham and Bluewater in Kent, were among the big names involved. Hundreds of thousands of shop workers received training via a specially devised customer service video. Other new commitments included to host \u201cquiet hours\u201d in stores, add \u201cnot every disability is visible\u201d signs and to run accessible facilities checks. Nearly one in five people in the UK has a disability or impairment, and more than half of households have a connection to someone with a disability. As part of Purple Tuesday the organisers asked firms to conduct accessibility audits in stores and on their websites, and to appoint internal \u201cdisability champions\u201d to raise issues at a board level in big firms. Adams, who is able to walk short distances but relies on a wheelchair, says physical access remains an issue for him. \u201cI never go on the tube [in London] because not all the stations have lifts. Many stores have wheelchair access now, which is great, but it\u2019s when you get inside the difficulties can start, with crowded layouts making it very difficult to get around without damaging anything.\u201d The rise of online shopping means the number of visitors to Britain\u2019s high streets is in decline but Seema Flower, the founder of the consultancy Blind Ambition, which champions disabled entrepreneurs, says the physical experience is preeminent for her. \u201cPeople says the internet is brilliant, but for the disabled and visually impaired it\u2019s not \u2013 because we like to feel and touch things,\u201d says Flower, who has been blind since she was a child. \u201cI can\u2019t appreciate the visual quality of a website. When I\u2019m buying a handbag I like to smell the leather and feel how heavy it is.\u201d Flower also rejects the idea that disabled people do not like to look good: \u201cThere is an assumption that if someone is registered disabled they are on benefits and unable to afford nice things. I like glamorous blingy stuff with Swarovski crystals on it. I like to look good.\u201d Despite progress in some areas, there is still a long way to go and not just for high street retailers. When the design agency Sigma carried out a mystery shopping exercise in the leisure sector this summer, it found a quarter of businesses could not accommodate a wheelchair while and a third were unable to assist with cognitive impairments like autism. \u201cInitiatives such as Purple Tuesday are a fantastic step forward,\u201d says Hilary Stephenson, the managing director of Sigma. \u201cHowever, inclusion should be an everyday consideration \u2013 it\u2019s not enough to simply be inclusive for one day a year and leave it at that.\u201d The actor and disability campaigner Samantha Renke, who has osteogenesis imperfecta, says her high street experience can still be \u201catrocious\u201d. \u201cIt can be very traumatic and humiliating, particularly when the staff don\u2019t know how to help or don\u2019t offer help,\u201d she says. Renke\u2019s worst experiences include being unable to pay because the till counter was out of reach (\u201cthe assistant just shrugged at me\u201d) and finding that accessible changing rooms are doubling as cupboards. \u201cRetailers need to look at attitudinal barriers,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to rearrange the whole shop. Train staff how to communicate and ask, \u2018how can I help you?\u2019\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Darby's exceedingly odd decision to quit Mr Kipling firm | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gavin Darby was the chief executive who won the big bun fight at the Mr Kipling firm Premier Foods in the summer. It was a bitterly fought affair but he survived in post with a 59:41 majority, thereby defeating Hong Kong-based hedge fund Oasis Management, the outfit that had accused him of leading a \u201czombie company\u201d. Now \u2013 less than four months later \u2013 Darby says he will leave in January anyway. The decision is exceedingly odd. Back in July, it was supposedly crucial that Premier kept Darby. The company rolled out two famous retailing lords, Ian MacLaurin and Mark Price, to applaud his talents. \u201cIf these activist investors succeed in removing him they risk destroying significant value, rather than creating it,\u201d declared Price, the former Waitrose chief. So why does a board that defended its chief executive to the hilt now seemingly not mind if he goes? Details were left vague. On one hand, Darby said he \u201cdecided to step down\u201d after six years. On the other, Premier\u2019s coy reference to \u201cfinancial arrangements\u201d suggests a payoff, and thus one of those euphemistic departures by mutual agreement. However you slice the battenberg, this looks like a victory in extra time for Oasis and its fellow rebels. They wanted Darby out and they also wanted Premier to flog an asset or two, which is now the new strategy. Ambrosia, the custard and rice pudding business, is on the block. Oasis had suggested Batchelors as a candidate but was mostly interested in the principle of selling something to reduce the \u00a3500m debt burden and to free up cash to invest. That is also the new hymn from the boardroom, even if everything naturally depends on somebody wishing to pay a fat price for Ambrosia. Perhaps the Premier chair, Keith Hamill, thought it would be unwise to risk another clash with investors given the slender margin of victory in July. That would be understandable. But at least explain the U-turn. As it is, Mr Kipling has successfully raged against the rebels and then given them what they wanted. There is a credibility deficit in the boardroom. Hard graft New chief executive, new dividend policy? Actually, no, Nick Read at Vodafone defied a few doubters by saying the telecoms group definitely won\u2019t be cutting distributions this year. What\u2019s more, the board will even contemplate increases once debt ratios improve. This pledge produced an 8% rise in the share price, which merely shows how many people had assumed Vodafone\u2019s pile of debt \u2013 a colossal \u20ac32bn at the last count \u2013 was about to hit the divi. The shares had slumped from 200p to 144p in the past six months, a mighty fall for a supposed titan of the FTSE 100. Even at the new price of 156p, however, the dividend yield is an eye-catching 8.4%, which suggests not everybody is convinced. On paper, though, the sums work. Free cash flow over the next three years is pencilled in to be \u20ac17bn. An annual \u20ac4bn divi, plus an average of \u20ac1.2bn a year in spectrum payments, leaves some room for manoeuvre. Then there\u2019s Read\u2019s new cost-cutting exercise to save \u20ac1.2bn a year. So, yes, the dividend-preservation exercise is credible. The shares may recover more ground. Yet it feels like very hard graft. A decade ago, mobile telephony and data was exciting. These days growth is counted in fractions of percentage points as the core product deflates in price. Vodafone has become a utility that offers utility-like returns. Wasted opportunity Interserve is allowed to be touchy about its share price. It is a large outsourcing company with an over-stretched balance sheet that is determined to avoid a Carillion-style spiral. Thus you can\u2019t blame the board for reacting to a sharp fall in the share price \u2013 10% on Monday and another 20% on Tuesday morning \u2013 by issuing a statement. There was just one problem: the comments \u201cfollowing recent press coverage\u201d avoided one key issue mentioned by the media in recent days. Interserve said its transformation plan \u201cremains on track\u201d and that \u201ca significant operating profit improvement\u201d is still expected this year. Jolly good. But outsiders have been focused on how much will have to be paid to exit from loss-making plants that generate energy from waste. That bill is separate from transformation plans and operating performance. It\u2019s about the size of provisions. Is the last estimate still correct given that Renewi, a joint venture partner, was grumbling about missed deadlines at a Derby plant last week? Interserve didn\u2019t say. As it happens, the market took silence on provisions to indicate no further bad news and the shares bounced back in the afternoon. But Interserve\u2019s board needs to be careful. If you really want to distinguish yourself from Carillion\u2019s mob, speak plainly.",

      "bodyText": "Npower, one of the UK\u2019s big six energy firms, has lost half a million customer accounts in 2018 and said it will make a loss for the fourth consecutive year. The exodus of households from the German-owned electricity and gas supplier amounts to a 10th of the 5m accounts it had at the start of the year. Large suppliers have all been shedding customers to smaller and cheaper challenger firms, but npower\u2019s losses are among the biggest of its peers. This year has seen record switching as the big six put up default tariffs in the face of rising wholesale costs. In the same period ScottishPower lost 300,000 customer accounts and now stands on 4.8m. Market leader, British Gas, has around 12.5m customer accounts but lost 350,000 in the first half of the year, and is due to report next week on the past three months. SSE, which is in the process of a troubled merger with npower, has around 7.45m customer accounts but analysts expect it will announce first-half year profits down more than 40% on Wednesday. Innogy, npower\u2019s parent company, said on Tuesday the subsidiary would make a loss this year, despite ongoing cost-cutting. The losses also come before the government\u2019s energy cap comes into effect on 1 January, which is expected to wipe millions off large suppliers\u2019 revenues. Industry watchers said npower had not been badly priced compared to its big six rivals but newer firms had put \u201cintense pressure\u201d on the larger suppliers. According to uSwitch, npower\u2019s cheapest deal is currently a \u00a31,085 one-year fix based on typical consumption and its most expensive tariff is \u00a31,255. Rik Smith, energy expert at the comparison site, said: \u201cNpower has been pricing relatively in line with its big six counterparts and at times earlier in the year it was offering some of the cheapest deals from the big suppliers. \u201cHowever, this hasn\u2019t been enough to stem its customer losses as people look further afield than the big six for a good energy deal.\u201d More than 4.2 million people have switched energy supplier this year so far, a record number and up 6% on the same period last year, according to industry body Energy-UK. Just six years ago, the big six controlled almost 100% of the market, but that is now 78%. The first generation of successful challenger firms such as First Utility and Ovo Energy has been joined by even younger entrants such as Bulb, which has become the biggest rival to the big six, just three years after it launched. Ownership is also changing, with oil and gas giant Shell buying First Utility last year with the promise of taking on the big six. However, questions have been asked about whether the pricing of smaller players is sustainable, and regulator Ofgem is mulling tougher barriers for new entrants. The merger of npower and the retail arm of SSE is a direct response to the increasingly competitive market. But the firms said last week that completion of the merger would be delayed and the commercial terms had to be renegotiated, because of tough market conditions and the price cap.",

    "webTitle": "UK unemployment: Vacancies at record high as EU workers leave - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap EU workers are quitting the UK at the fastest rate since at least 1997. New labour markets figures show a 132,000 drop in the number of citizens from other European Union countries working in Britain. The trend is driving job vacancies in the UK to a record high; there are now some 845,000 unfilled positions. Business groups warn that it\u2019s getting harder for firms to hire qualified staff. Today\u2019s jobs report also shows that the UK unemployment rate has risen to 4.1%, up from a 43-year low of 4.0%. That\u2019s because an extra 21,000 lost their jobs in the last quarter. However, the number of people IN work rose by 23,000 during the period, taking the employment total to a new high. There\u2019s good news on wages too; basic pay growth picked up to 3.2% year, while total pay (including bonuses) rose by 3.1%. That means real wages are rising, but we\u2019re still not back at pre-crisis levels after a decade. Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the CIPD, sums up the situation: \u201cThe underlying state of the labour market remains strong despite unusually weak employment growth and the consequent small rise in unemployment. \u201cThere was a significant increase in full time and permanent employment, largely offset by falling self-employment, temporary and part time work. Regular pay strengthened slightly and, with inflation falling, real pay growth has strengthened significantly. \u201cThe slight rise in unemployment is partly explained by more people of working age entering the labour market and actively looking for work than in the past. However, if future employment growth continues to fall short of the increase in job seekers, then further modest rises in unemployment can be expected. \u201cMuch will depend on whether the current economic and business uncertainty over Brexit and the world economy can be reduced in the coming months. \u201cEmployers can expect to face continued recruitment and retention pressures and need to prioritise workforce planning.\u201d That\u2019s all for today, I think. Goodnight! Back in the markets, the pound is surging amid reports that a Brexit withdrawal agreement has finally been agreed. Sterling has surged almost two cents, to $1.3027 and on track for one of its biggest jumps this year. It\u2019s also hitting six-month highs against the euro, at \u20ac1.154, meaning one euro is worth 86.6p. According to Westminster sources, cabinet ministers will be shown the text tonight, ahead of a full cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Irish media group RTE is reporting that the plan includes a backstop agreement in which the whole UK remains in a customs arrangement, but with \u201cdeeper\u201d provisions for Northern Ireland on the customs and regulatory side. Our politics liveblog has all the details: There was a particularly sharp drop in workers from eight EU countries: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia This chart shows the full details: Here\u2019s Alasdair Ross of the Economist Intelligence Unit: The Federation of Small Businesses fears that UK firms are facing a dearth of talent, now that EU nationals are in short supply. FSB chairman Mike Cherry says more firms are reporting problems hiring the right staff: \u201cMore than one in three small firms now say lack of access to the right skills is holding back growth \u2013 up from roughly a quarter at this time last year. \u201cOne in five small employers rely on staff from the EU. With net migration from Europe falling, it\u2019s increasingly a challenge for firms to recruit from the vital pool of EU talent based here in the UK. If we don\u2019t see a pro-business withdrawal agreement signed before the month is out, this challenge will become even more pronounced and entrenched. The Brexit clock is ticking. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to remember that 95 per cent of small firms have never made use of the UK\u2019s points-based immigration system. If they\u2019re lumbered with complex paperwork to bring in EU staff post-Brexit that will cause a significant drag on the billions they contribute to the economy each year. Today\u2019s jobs report shows that British firms are creating much fewer new jobs than a year ago. So, with Brexit looming, bosses must fear that the struggle to find qualified workers will only get worse. Here\u2019s Reuter\u2019s take: Unemployment unexpectedly rose to 4.1% in the three months to September from a 43-year low of 4.0% the previous quarter, as slowing job creation failed to keep pace with rising job-seeker numbers. Britain\u2019s economy added 23,000 jobs in the third quarter, a fraction of the 350,000 created over the previous 12 months. Moreover, in the year to September there was an exodus of workers from the eight eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004. Their numbers fell by 154,000 to 881,000, a record 15 percent drop that overwhelmed a small rise in workers from elsewhere in the EU. Britain has said EU citizens already in the country will be free to stay after Brexit but many fear bureaucratic hurdles or see improved prospects in their home countries. Sectors such as hotels and restaurants, social care, food processing and construction rely especially heavily on EU staff, particularly for lower-paid jobs. \u201cWe already have record numbers of vacancies, and the signs are that these skills shortages will further intensify over the next few months as EU workers no longer find the UK an attractive place to work,\u201d said Tom Hadley, policy director at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation trade association. Some Brexit supporters will probably feel that that the departure of EU workers should be welcomed, as it frees up jobs for other people. But Professor Guglielmo Meardi of Warwick Business School argues that this is wrong -- it could actually cost jobs. Here\u2019s his take on the 132,000 fall in EU workers in the UK: \u201cThe record fall in the number of EU workers is not just linked with wage growth, it is also linked with the rise in unemployment. \u201cIn some occupations these EU workers are competitors for British workers and employers now have to pay more to recruit the remaining British or foreign workforce. \u201cHowever, in other sectors they are complementary to British workers and are needed to keep business alive. Without them businesses are forced to close, contributing to the rise in unemployment. \u201cEnding free movement now appears to be a totally pointless aim for the UK. The effect of announcing this policy was more than enough to bring down net immigration from the EU and, given earning and demographic trends, it is very unlikely to be reversed.\u201d Yesterday, we were reporting that the oil price has jumped, after Saudi Arabia appeared to pave the way for supply cuts in 2019. The situation has reversed today, though; crude prices are falling sharply. Brent crude has shed 3.35% to $67.77 per barrel, and US crud has hit its lowest level of the year. So what changed? Well, Donald Trump weighed in last night, arguing that Opec should take steps to get the oil price down, not throttling supply to get it up again..... Over in the City, outsourcing and construction firm Interserve has just insisted that its turnaround programme is on track, after watching its shares sink to a new 30-year low. In a statement to shareholder, Interserve says: Interserve notes recent press commentary surrounding the Group and the movement in its share price. Interserve confirms that the implementation of the Group\u2019s strategy and the Fit for Growth transformation programme remains on track and the Group continues to expect a significant operating profit improvement in 2018, in line with management\u2019s expectations. The \u2018movement\u2019 in Interserve\u2019s shares has been sharp, and largely one-way. On Monday they shed 10%, and were down another 20% earlier today, to their lowest level since 1985. Delays at a Derby waste energy plant have fuelled concerns over Interserve\u2019s financial health. And pressure is mounting; this morning, one former shareholder told the BBC that Interserve would struggle to raise the extra capital it needs. However, shares are recovering as I type - now only down 6% today, following this announcement. Here\u2019s the chancellor, Philip Hammond\u2019s take: Those budget measures included a \u00a33bn giveaway that mainly benefited higher earners. That\u2019s been criticised by those who think the money could have been better directed, perhaps to fund schools or to cushion the impact of universal credit. Labour, though, have resisted pressure to oppose the measures - side-stepping a Tory tax trap?... Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the UK jobs data: The countdown to Brexit has seen the number of workers in Britain from the former communist countries of eastern Europe fall at its sharpest rate since modern records began more than two decades ago. Official figures covering the summer and early autumn showed a 154,000 drop over the past year in the number of people employed from eight countries \u2013 including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \u2013 that joined the EU in the early 2000s. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the year-on-year fall to 881,000 in the number of these workers in the period of July to September was the largest since 1997. The annual 132,000 drop in the number of workers from the EU as a whole was also unprecedented. Employment from the rest of the world grew by 34,000. The decline came as the latest ONS statistics showed tentative signs of easing in demand for labour but a marked increase in earnings growth. While the number of people employed grew by 23,000 between June and September, the number of jobless people rose by 21,000 to 1.38 million. The unemployment rate edged up from 4% to 4.1%. More here: Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School, has analysed today\u2019s UK labour market report, and says it provides \u201cmixed, but broadly favourable, news.\u201d Unemployment rose by some 21000 in the third quarter, and the rate now stands at 4.1%. But, with an increase in the population of over-16s, employment also rose over this period. Particularly positive is the news of a huge increase (some 104000 over the quarter) in the number of full-time employees, this being accompanied by a decline of 58000 in the number of part-time employees, and also a decline in the number of self-employed workers. Underemployment, taking the form of people working fewer hours than they would like and working in less secure circumstances than they would like, has been a problem in recent years, but seems now to be in decline. \u201cThe three-month measure of total pay increase rose to 3% in September, and the three-month measure of regular pay increase rose to 3.2%. The less reliable single-month figures indicate some easing off of this rate of increase in the most recent month, so the good news on pay still needs to be treated with a measure of caution. The sectors leading the growth in pay are construction and distribution.\u201d Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has flagged up that Britain is making good progress in helping disabled people into the workplace. She says the government\u2019s \u201c Disability Confident\u201d programme, which helps firms recruit and retain disabled people and people with health conditions, is paying off. \u201cAs we celebrate the anniversary of Disability Confident, we can see seismic shifts in opportunities for disabled people, with almost a million more in work since 2013. \u201cThat\u2019s empowering almost a million more disabled people with new career opportunities, and creating a brighter future. \u201cSince 2010, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen in every single region of the UK. And with an average of 1,000 people moving into work each and every day, and three quarters of all new jobs in permanent, full time and high skilled roles, this shows our welfare reforms are working and delivering for people across the country.\u201d This chart, from the Resolution Foundation think tank, shows clearly how EU nationals stopped coming to the UK to work after the EU referendum, or decided to leave: Resolution have tweeted some more useful charts too: Here\u2019s economist Sam Tombs on the drop in EU nationals working in the UK: Britain\u2019s unions aren\u2019t impressed by the news that nominal pay (excluding inflation) has hit a 10-year high. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady points out that wages are still below their pre-crisis level, once you adjust for the cost of living. \u201cPay is rising at a snail\u2019s pace and wages aren\u2019t expected to return to their pre-crash value for at least another 6 years. \u201cBoosting pay packets must be a priority. That means the government putting the minimum wage up to \u00a310 as quickly as possible. And it means giving unions the freedom to enter every workplace and negotiate fair pay rises.\u201d Today\u2019s jobs report shows the impact of the high street retail crisis on Britain\u2019s labour force: Although 132,000 new jobs were created between June 2017 and 2018, the number of people working in wholesaling, retailing and motor vehicle repairs fell by 73,000. This was the largest annual fall in the number of jobs in that sector since June 2010. Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, fears that firms will keep struggling to find staff, which could push wages higher. \u201cThis data suggests that the labour market is now pretty tight. Unemployment remains very low in historic terms, but is unlikely to fall much further, given the slowdown in job creation. The result of this is likely to be further upward pressure on wages as companies struggle for find workers to fill vacancies. We are likely to hear much more about worker shortages in the coming year.\u201d Of course, if firms can\u2019t hire enough staff, they\u2019ll struggle to grow and become more productive - which isn\u2019t great for wages in the long term..... With EU workers departing, the number of unfilled jobs in the UK had hit a record level. According to the ONS, there were 845,000 job vacancies for August to October 2018. This was: 14,000 more than for May to July 2018 44,000 more than for a year earlier the highest since comparable records began in 2001 The Institute of Directors say the pool of labour talent is shrinking [as EU workers head for the nearest port or airport in record numbers] Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, explains: \u201cWith pay packets finally picking up, households and retailers will have something to cheer about as we reach the festive period. Meanwhile, businesses are continuing to show resilience by opening up positions and pushing for new hires. \u201cHowever, we\u2019re unlikely to be entering a \u2018new dawn\u2019 for persistent wage growth just yet, as firms are facing ongoing struggles investing in their productivity. Business leaders are also finding it more and more difficult to fill openings as the pool of available talent shrinks. Pawel Adrjan, economist at jobs site indeed.com, reckons UK firms are being forced to raise wages because labour is in shorter supply, as EU workers head home. Brexit is now having a significant impact on the jobs market. Today\u2019s unemployment report shows a record decline in the number of workers from other EU countries in the UK. However, the number of people born outside the UK working here has risen. Here\u2019s the details from the ONS: UK nationals working in the UK increased by 448,000 to 29.00 million EU nationals working in the UK fell by 132,000 to 2.25 million (the largest annual fall since comparable records began in 1997) Non-EU nationals working in the UK increased by 34,000 to 1.24 million. Has Britain\u2019s long run of falling unemployment ended?.... UK wage growth is less impressive once you account for inflation, of course. While nominal pay jumped by 3.2% per year (a 10-year high), real pay (adjusted for inflation) only rose by 0.9% - the best since the end of 2016. The number of people unemployed in the UK has risen by 21,000 in July-September, driving the jobless rate up to 4.1%. But.... the number of people IN work rose by 23,000 over the quarter, to 32.41m. That\u2019s the highest total since record began in 1971, leaving the employmenr rate near a record high at 75.5%. BREAKING: Britain\u2019s unemployment has risen to 4.1% in the three months to September. That\u2019s up from the 43-year low of 4%. But there\u2019s better news on earnings. Average pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 3.2% per year in the last quarter -- the biggest rise in a decade. More to follow! A new opinion poll suggests that the budget row hasn\u2019t hurt the Italian government\u2019s popularity. Support for the far-right League party has risen. EU budget battles are sometimes painted as clash between rule-making Northern members and rule-breaking Southerners. But the chief economist of Germany\u2019s Deutsche bank argues that Europe should accept that austerity is not the answer. Instead, they should help Italy cut its massive \u20ac2 trillion debt mountain. Writing in the FT, David Folkerts-Landau, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, says Italy has actually been more disciplined than popularly thought: Contrary to widespread prejudice, Italy has been a frugal country. Its debt overhang is a legacy from before it entered the eurozone. Since then it has achieved a primary budget surplus (the excess of revenue over non-interest spending) almost every year. By comparison, all other eurozone countries, with the exception of Germany, have racked up cumulative primary deficits. Italy\u2019s new debt since 2000 has been used to pay interest; it has not financed spending. Plus, the country has also achieved a current account surplus in recent years. So what\u2019s the solution? Folkerts-Landau argues that Europe must reduce Italy\u2019s debt servicing costs, creating space for targeted spending. To achieve that, the EC\u2019s bailout fund (the European Stability Mechanism) would have to get involved by helping Italy buyback some debt. Interest on the ESM loan would be payable when Italy\u2019s economy had achieved higher productivity and growth. It\u2019s an interesting idea --- but it would involve Brussels putting a lot of trust in Rome -- at a time when euroscepticism is rising. More here.... European stock markets have opened higher, amid hopes that Rome and Brussels could patch up their differences. The FTSE 100 is up 30 points, led by Vodafone (+7%) which is outlining cost-cutting plans this morning after posting an \u20ac7.8bn loss (partly due to writedowns). Traders are shrugging off the big losses in Asia earlier today, after Wall Street\u2019s wobble: Italy\u2019s problems are compounded by the fact that its economy is slowing. There was no growth in the last quarter, forcing several economists to downgrade their forecasts. That gives Rome even less wriggle-room to raise spending without breaching deficit limits (set as a percentage of GDP). Just in: An Italian government minister has predicted that Rome will not make many changes to its 2019 budget today. Lorenzo Fioramonti, a junior minister for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, told CNBC that: \u201cI don\u2019t expect the Italian government to make any substantial revisions,\u201d \u201cI think there may be a dialogue around some potential second steps, but I think the bulk, the core of what\u2019s being proposed will stay the same.\u201d Fioramonti also argued that Brussels needs to rethink its whole approach to economic policy, and recognise that Italy needs help to escape its weak growth and high debt. \u201cIt is important that Europe comes to the realization that having a founding member in such a level of distress requires a collective effort to change.\u201d Bloomberg also expects Italy to remain committed to its previous fiscal plans, despite the EC\u2019s concerns. It says: In response to the European Commission\u2019s request for a fresh budget from Italy, the most you can expect today from Rome is a few tweaks. With Finance Minister Giovanni Tria saying meeting the EU demand would be \u201csuicide,\u201d Italy is likely to stick to its guns. Deputy Premiers Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini would rather risk a possible escalation of their spat with Brussels than go back on campaign promises. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The battle over Italy\u2019s budget plans is intensifying. Today is the deadline for Rome to submit a revised 2019 budget to the European Commission for approval -- and it\u2019s not clear that the EC will be any more impressed than last time. Italy\u2019s new government appears to be sticking to its principles, arguing that the country needs a new stimulus to boost its growth. That means more spending, and higher borrowing than the EU would like. The original plan forecast a deficit of 2.4% of GDP in 2019. That sparked Brussels\u2019 disapproval, especially as EU officials suspect the growth forecasts underpinning the budget are too optimistic. If Italy doesn\u2019t back down, it could potentially face EU sanctions. But its coalition of populist and anti-establishment parties remain committed to the spending and tax plans which won them power this year (and which Italian voters clearly want!). Paolo Pizzoli, senior economist at ING, suspects economy minister Giovanni Tria may make some small concessions to the EC, but perhaps nothing too significant. Pizzoli writes: We don\u2019t expect the government to amend its 2.4% deficit/GDP target, often considered as the unmovable political standpoint. However, on the back of poor data releases, we believe the new draft might include less optimistic GDP projections and/or the inclusion of automatic spending cuts to ensure that the 2.4% target is an absolute maximum. This would be a small signal of flexibility towards softening the confrontational stance towards the EU, in an environment where the Italian government is being increasingly isolated within the EU Council. Also coming up today The latest UK unemployment figures may show the jobless rate remains at its lowest since the mid-1970s. Economists hope that wage growth (including bonuses) has picked up, to 3% from 2.7% last month. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Unemployment is expected to remain at current multi decade lows of just 4%. In the eyes of the market, the UK is at full employment. A slight tweak higher or lower is unlikely to have a big impact on the value of the pound. Therefore, dealers will focus on earnings data once again. Average weekly earnings are expected to increase to 3% in the three months to September, a significant jump from 2.7% the previous month. Weekly earnings excluding bonus are expected to remain constant at 3.1%. The strongest pace of the growth in a decade. Global stock markets are edgy, after Wall Street suffered a bad Monday. The Dow shedding 600 points last night, while Apple plunged by 5% after several key suppliers cut their own forecasts. This has already rocked Asia, where the Japanese stock market has lost 2% in a nervy sell-off. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK unemployment data 10am GMT: ZEW survey of German economic sentiment",

Its debt overhang is a legacy from before it entered the eurozone. Since then it has achieved a primary budget surplus (the excess of revenue over non-interest spending) almost every year.</p> <p>By comparison, all other eurozone countries, with the exception of Germany, have racked up cumulative primary deficits. Italy\u2019s new debt since 2000 has been used to pay interest; it has not financed spending. Plus, the country has also achieved a current account surplus in recent years.</p> </blockquote> <p>So what\u2019s the solution? Folkerts-Landau argues that Europe must reduce Italy\u2019s debt servicing costs, creating space for targeted spending. To achieve that, the EC\u2019s bailout fund (the European Stability Mechanism) would have to get involved by helping Italy buyback some debt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Interest on the ESM loan would be payable when Italy\u2019s economy had achieved higher productivity and growth. </p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s an interesting idea --- but it would involve Brussels putting a lot of trust in Rome -- at a time when euroscepticism is rising.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8d572b8-e65d-11e8-8827-ff56e7163c11\">More here....</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/georgemagnus1/status/1062272568210743297\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I think David F-L has this right.

Today is the deadline for Rome to submit a revised 2019 budget to the European Commission for approval -- and it\u2019s not clear that the EC will be any more impressed than last time.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s new government appears to be sticking to its principles, arguing that the country needs a new stimulus to boost its growth. That means more spending, and higher borrowing than the EU would like.</p> <p>The original plan forecast a deficit of 2.4% of GDP in 2019. That sparked Brussels\u2019 disapproval, especially as EU officials suspect the growth forecasts underpinning the budget are too optimistic.</p> <p>If Italy doesn\u2019t back down, it could potentially face EU sanctions. But its coalition of populist and anti-establishment parties remain committed to the spending and tax plans which won them power this year (and which Italian voters clearly want!).</p> <p><strong>Paolo Pizzoli, </strong>senior economist at <strong>ING</strong>, suspects economy minister Giovanni Tria may make some small concessions to the EC, but perhaps nothing too significant.</p> <p><strong>Pizzoli</strong> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t expect the government to amend its 2.4% deficit/GDP target, often considered as the unmovable political standpoint. However, on the back of poor data releases, we believe the new draft might include less optimistic GDP projections and/or the inclusion of automatic spending cuts to ensure that the 2.4% target is an absolute maximum.<br></p> <p>This would be a small signal of flexibility towards softening the confrontational stance towards the EU, in an environment where the Italian government is being increasingly isolated within the EU Council.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Also coming up today</h2> <p>The latest UK unemployment figures may show the jobless rate remains at its lowest since the mid-1970s. Economists hope that wage growth (including bonuses) has picked up, to 3% from 2.7% last month.</p> <p><strong>Jasper Lawler </strong>of <strong>London Capital Group</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unemployment is expected to remain at current multi decade lows of just 4%. In the eyes of the market, the UK is at full employment. A slight tweak higher or lower is unlikely to have a big impact on the value of the pound. Therefore, dealers will focus on earnings data once again.</p> <p>Average weekly earnings are expected to increase to 3% in the three months to September, a significant jump from 2.7% the previous month. Weekly earnings excluding bonus are expected to remain constant at 3.1%. The strongest pace of the growth in a decade.</p> </blockquote> <p>Global stock markets are edgy, after Wall Street suffered a bad Monday. The Dow shedding 600 points last night, while Apple plunged by 5% after several key suppliers cut their own forecasts.</p> <p>This has already rocked Asia, where the Japanese stock market has lost 2% in a nervy sell-off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidInglesTV/status/1062140134848573440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Every single stock on the Nikkei 225 is down.

FirstGroup said rail industry conditions had been very challenging, citing macroeconomic uncertainty, engineering works and strikes in the ongoing row about the future of guards. Profit margins across rail halved in the year from 4.6% to 2.4%. Although FirstGroup has profited handsomely from its misfiring Great Western service, where it has been handed a succession of direct awards without competition, the South Western franchise, which FirstGroup took over as majority partner with Hong Kong\u2019s MTR in August 2017, has joined TransPennine as a financial drain. FirstGroup is in discussions with the Department for Transport to review a mechanism in its franchise agreement that was designed to share revenue risks with the government, should passenger numbers fall. It said there was \u201cuncertainty regarding the outcomes of this mechanism \u2026 which has the potential to significantly impact the profitability of the franchise.\u201d Gregory said the mechanism designed to balance risk and reward in the South Western franchise by tracking employment in London boroughs it served, was not working. \u201cThe rates of employment don\u2019t really correspond with [passenger numbers]\u2026 they\u2019re not working in tandem.\u201d According to analysts at RBC, FirstGroup has lost an estimated \u00a37-8m in the last six months on South Western. Swingeing losses are already expected at TransPennine Express \u2013 about \u00a3110m \u2013 FirstGroup announced in May, over its franchise term up to 2023. Last week one of FirstGroup\u2019s top shareholders called for the board to stand down, according to the Financial Times, citing the rail losses and comparing it unfavourably with National Express, which has exited rail in the UK. Gregory said: \u201cIf I look back at rail, we\u2019ve reported \u00a329m of profit in the last six months, FirstGroup has had significant profits before: it\u2019s a balance of making sure the risk and reward is appropriate. We\u2019re happy to continue to bid for franchises in the future.\u201d He said infrastructure failures, flexible working patterns for commuters and industrial relations were among a number of factors affecting South Western\u2019s numbers. \u201cWe did have issues in the first half \u2013 the Holden Review has talked about some of the problems on that network.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got work to do to improve the experience for our customers, and there\u2019s still some way to go,\u201d he said. FirstGroup had better news from its First Student business, which operates 42,500 school buses in the US. Gregory said revenue grew in the first half for the first time in 10 years: \u201cIt\u2019s been through some troubled times but it\u2019s now in the position where we can grow.\u201d The group\u2019s share price rallied from its recent depths on the first-half results, up 8% at the end of morning trading. Gregory had been interim chief operations officer since Tim O\u2019Toole\u2019s resignation in May, and had been chief financial officer for almost three years. He will be paid \u00a3635k a year basic, which he could quadruple with bonuses.",

    "webTitle": "Virgin Australia engineer sacked for alleged misconduct after raising safety concerns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Virgin Australia flight operations engineer who raised safety concerns with his superiors was sacked for alleged misconduct, documents show. Internal records show Brisbane-based Virgin employee Yahya Khattabi raised concerns in mid-September about the training manuals given to the airline\u2019s new Boeing 737 pilots, alleging they failed to comply with federal regulations. Senior management disagreed with his claims, but Khattabi persisted and organised a meeting with his superiors for further discussion on 21 September. The meeting did not take place. On the same day, Khattabi received a letter telling him he was suspended with immediate effect for serious allegations that he had breached Virgin\u2019s code of conduct. The airline wrote to Khattabi again five days later, expanding on its reasons for the suspension. It alleged Khattabi had \u201csent a series of emails\u201d in the week before his suspension that \u201cincluded content and/or adopted a tone that was threatening, inappropriate, disrespectful and unprofessional\u201d. It also cited Khattabi\u2019s reaction to being suspended as evidence of his misconduct. Khattabi, the airline said, had torn up the suspension letter, laughed, called his superiors \u201crobots\u201d, roughly pulled notes from a senior executive in the room, and threatened to sue the individuals present. Virgin terminated his employment several weeks later, saying it had lost trust in him and that he had previously been warned about his communication style. In its termination letter, Virgin said the way he had raised the safety concerns was threatening and disrespectful. \u201cFurther, your insistence in your response that raising safety concerns and addressing those concerns was a part of your job indicates that you fail to appreciate that while you may be required to raise and deal with such concerns, the manner in which you raised and pursued those concerns was inappropriate, threatening, disrespectful and unprofessional and ultimately a breach of the code of conduct and your employment contract,\u201d the airline said in its termination letter to Khattabi. Khattabi denied he had acted in a threatening or disrespectful way, but asked colleagues who were offended to \u201caccept my apology as it was never my intention\u201d. He has since lodged an unfair dismissal claim in the Fair Work Commission, which is due for a conciliation hearing on 22 November, according to documents filed with the tribunal. Khattabi has also composed a 43-page report detailing his concerns with Virgin\u2019s 737 training material and submitted it to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Casa). \u201cWhat I found was astonishing, the line pilots were left with very little technical knowledge on takeoff and landing performance,\u201d his report to Casa said. \u201cThe course itself was confusing with substantial inaccuracies and outright incorrect information. \u201cAfter careful investigation, I found out that these were not just inaccuracies, but breaches to Casa regulations including the CAO 20.7.1B and CAR 217.\u201d His report linked the failings to \u201cpoor landing performance in Christchurch in 2015 and a runway excursion in Hobart in 2010\u201d. \u201cBoth incidents involve the B737 flight crew and both incidents are due to similar causes, mainly, the inadequate training of the B737 flight crew on aircraft performance,\u201d he said. Guardian Australia understands Casa has received the report only recently but is considering the information. No formal investigation has begun. In a statement, Virgin Australia said it conducted its own audit of Khattabi\u2019s \u201cregulatory compliance\u201d concerns. \u201cWe acknowledge concerns were raised by a former employee about regulatory compliance however an audit of the applicable procedures found absolutely no truth to these concerns and the matters to be compliant,\u201d a spokeswoman said. She said safety was \u201cat the forefront of Virgin Australia\u2019s operations\u201d and was its number one priority. \u201cVirgin Australia is fully compliant with all Casa regulations and has not been informed of any investigation into regulatory compliance matters,\u201d she said. The airline could not comment on the specifics of Khattabi\u2019s unfair dismissal claim. Aviation expert Neil Hansford, who runs the consultancy Strategic Aviation Solutions, reviewed Khattabi\u2019s complaint after being approached by Guardian Australia. Hansford said his early reading suggested the complaint was worthy of investigation. \u201cThese manuals in the main are used by people who are joining Virgin to fly the 737,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty important documents. Without doing an analysis of his documents [myself], they appear to raise issues that are worthy of more attention than what they appear to have had at Virgin.\u201d Last month, while Khattabi was suspended, Virgin\u2019s group executive, Rob Sharp, wrote to tell him his safety concerns were being investigated, or had already been investigated. \u201cI am the [air operator\u2019s certificate] holder and I am fully aware of your specific safety-related concerns and these concerns have been or are in the process of being investigated,\u201d Sharp told Khattabi. \u201cYou were also advised that some of the issues you have raised have already been dealt with. To the extent that your email below raises any issues not raised before, these will also be reviewed.\u201d \u2022 This reporting is supported by the Susan McKinnon Foundation through the Guardian Civic Journalism Trust",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis has blamed mild weather and tough price cuts elsewhere on the high street for a dramatic slump in clothing and homeware sales. The retailer\u2019s overall sales fell more than 8% last week but the picture in its clothing and homeware departments was worse, down more than 11%. The poor clothing figures came despite the employee-owned chain\u2019s recent investment in its womenswear ranges, including the 300-piece John Lewis &amp; Partners collection. The retailer, which is used as a barometer of spending by the middle classes, said its fashion departments faced tough comparisons from a year ago, when sales were boosted by its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d price-match policy. \u201cTotal sales for the week were down 8.3% due to unseasonably mild weather and the fact we were price-matching a competitor this time last year,\u201d said Dino Rocos, the John Lewis &amp; Partners operations director. It was also a challenging week for homeware, which fell 11.2.% after a sluggish housing market hit demand for curtains and cushions. Technology fared better and, though sales were down by 2.8%, the department was bolstered by gadget launches such as the iPhone XR. It has been a tough year for the high street due to rising costs and weak consumer spending, with much riding on the success of the Christmas period, known as \u201cthe golden quarter\u201d in the retail trade. The John Lewis Partnership, which also owns Waitrose, has not been immune from the decline, with a collapse in profitability in the first six months of the year. The department store chain slumped to a first-half loss of more than \u00a319m, compared with a \u00a354m profit a year earlier, as it invested in IT systems and new stores and soaked up price cuts. The most recent data from Springboard, which counts shopper numbers, showed high street footfall down 2% in October \u2013 the 11th consecutive month of decline. Its analysts suggested shoppers were waiting for Black Friday and other seasonal promotions. \u201cConsumer demand is continuing to weaken, which, as we head into the key trading period of the year, suggests that Christmas could be challenging,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, Springboard\u2019s marketing and insights director. John Lewis launches its much-vaunted Christmas ad this week and the retailer will hope it can mirror the magic of last year\u2019s Moz the Monster campaign, which helped the department store chain record festive sales.",

      "bodyText": "Foxtons has closed six of its London branches as it struggles to sell homes in a \u201cchallenging\u201d property market in the capital. The estate agency said it had recently closed its offices on Park Lane in central London, Barnes, Beckenham, Enfield, Loughton and Ruislip. \u201cWe continue to cover over 85% of London from 61 branches and have no current plans for further closures,\u201d the company said in a trading update for the three months to 30 September. A majority of employees from the closed branches were redeployed elsewhere in the business, a spokesperson said, with redundancies in single digits. Foxtons, known for its fleet of branded Mini Coopers, has been hit by a slowing property market in London, where surging prices in recent years have left many buyers unable to afford a home in the capital. Demand has also been hit by Brexit uncertainty and higher stamp duty on second homes. Third-quarter revenue in its sales business fell to \u00a39.9m from \u00a310.3m in the same period a year earlier. Lettings remained positive, however, with revenue picking up to \u00a323.1m from \u00a322.5m. Over the first nine months of the year, total revenue stood at \u00a388.1m, down from \u00a393.7m at the same point last year. The Foxtons chief executive, Nic Budden, said it was \u201ca solid quarter in a challenging market\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are managing the business for the current market conditions and remain confident in our long-term prospects.\u201d At the time of its first-half results in July, Foxtons revealed it had swung to a loss of \u00a32.5m compared with a \u00a33.8m profit in the first half of 2017, as conditions toughened in London. The slowdown represents a sharp reversal in fortunes for Foxtons, which made its stock market debut in 2013. By 2014, a time of bumper profits and shareholder payouts, shares hit a high of 374p. On Tuesday shares in the company were down 0.3% at just below 50p.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s employers have warned that severe skills shortages are holding back the economy after the latest official figures showed the biggest fall in the number of workers from eastern Europe since modern records began. The British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to deliver a post-Brexit migration system to meet their needs amid signs that the fall in unemployment in recent years was putting upward pressure on wages. In its latest update on the state of the labour market, the Office for National Statistics revealed that in the countdown to Brexit the number of workers in the UK from the former Soviet bloc countries fell by 154,000 to 881,000 in the past year. Official figures covering the summer and early autumn showed a 14.9% drop over the past year in the number of people employed from eight countries \u2013 including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \u2013 that joined the EU in the early 2000s. The annual 132,000 drop in the number of workers from the EU as a whole was also unprecedented. Employment from the rest of the world grew by 34,000. The decline came as the ONS reported a marked increase in earnings growth despite evidence that demand for workers had eased during 2018. While the number of people employed grew by 23,000 between June and September, the number of jobless people rose by 21,000 to 1.38 million. The unemployment rate edged up from 4% to 4.1%. With unemployment still close to levels last seen in the mid-1970s, the recent upward pressure on wages continued. The ONS said total pay, which includes bonuses, was growing at an annual rate of 3% in the three months ending in September \u2013 the fastest growth rate in three years. Adjusted for inflation, earnings were up by 0.9%, a rate not exceeded since late 2016. Annual growth in regular pay, which strips out bonuses, reached 3.2%, a rate not seen since the immediate aftermath of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, which pushed the global economy into its deepest recession since the second world war. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC said: \u201cThere is clear evidence of a deep-rooted skills gap across the UK which is constraining business growth. To plug skills shortages, the government must deliver a post-Brexit migration system that enables access to the skills needed at all levels to help grow our economy.\u201d A fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit referendum and strong growth in their own economies has made the UK less attractive to workers from eastern Europe. Over the same period, the number of EU nationals from western European countries working in the UK has risen by almost 50,000. Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThe sharp fall in EU migrant workers over the last year shows that Britain\u2019s labour market is already changing ahead of its exit from the EU, and long before its post-Brexit migration plan is in place. \u201cFirms who employ a large share of migrant workers need to think now about adjusting to a lower migration environment, in terms of the workers they employ, what they produce and how they operate.\u201d The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Ed Davey, said: \u201cEven before we\u2019ve left the EU, we\u2019re seeing a Brexodus that is bad for British businesses and especially bad for our public services. Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB, said: \u201cOne in five small employers rely on staff from the EU. With net migration from Europe falling, it\u2019s increasingly a challenge for firms to recruit from the vital pool of EU talent based here in the UK. If we don\u2019t see a pro-business withdrawal agreement signed before the month is out, this challenge will become even more pronounced and entrenched. The Brexit clock is ticking. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to remember that 95% of small firms have never made use of the UK\u2019s points-based immigration system. If they\u2019re lumbered with complex paperwork to bring in EU staff post-Brexit that will cause a significant drag on the billions they contribute to the economy each year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Westminster city council is to ban new supersize properties built for oligarchs and other members of the global elite in order to free up space for more affordable homes for \u201creal people\u201d. The council, which includes the areas of Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, said it would restrict new homes larger than 150 sq metres (1,615 sq ft). Westminster said banning \u201cMonopoly board-style\u201d homes would help free up more space for affordable homes for Londoners. The ban is part of Westminster\u2019s 2019-40 development plan released on Monday night, which also included a commitment to build more than 10,000 affordable units by 2040. \u201cWe want Westminster to be home to thriving, mixed communities, not empty super-prime properties,\u201d said councillor Richard Beddoe, who oversees planning in Westminster. \u201cThat\u2019s why we will be restricting the size of new luxury apartments and introducing a new extra bedroom policy to make it easier for families to extend their homes so they have enough space to stay living in Westminster and are not forced to move out. \u201cBuilding the right type of homes for people to live in is priority number one in our city plan. There\u2019s a national crisis and we have to play our part in fixing that, not just for the benefit of UK as a whole, but for the real people who have legitimate aspirations to build their lives and grow up with their families in our city.\u201d The council said 150 sq metres was 50% larger than the average private home in the borough and would \u201cstill enable generously sized homes to be developed to meet development from the prime market, but balances that against the other, more strategic housing need of the city\u201d. The average size of UK has been shrinking in recent years. Homes built over the past decade have about 67.8 sq metres of living space, according to Local Authority Building Control (LABC). That works out at not much more more space than both floors of a double decker London bus, which comprises 55 sq metres. The mega-mansion ban is the latest attempt by Westminster to tackle growing inequality in the borough, where very few people can afford to buy or rent a home on the open market. \u201cThe average household income in Westminster is \u00a352,199, yet the median house price was \u00a31,054,400 in 2017,\u201d the council said. \u201cThat\u2019s nearly two times higher than London as a whole and almost five times higher than that of the UK.\u201d Earlier this year, the council blocked a proposal to create a 1,580 sq metre, \u00a340m home in a Grade I listed terrace overlooking Regent\u2019s Park, telling the developer to \u201cwake up\u201d to the housing crisis. Westminster has already introduced tight restrictions on homeowners digging large basements to create so-called \u201ciceberg homes\u201d with several underground storeys used for gyms, cinemas, swimming pools and garages. However, the council did approve the construction of a block of 57 luxury apartments without a single affordable unit. The cheapest 1,000 sq ft flat in the Park Modern development is being marketed for sale at \u00a32m. A a double-height five-bedroom penthouse is offered for \u00a330m. Henry Pryor, an independent luxury property buying agent, said: \u201cAt last there\u2019s a chance that we may get some truly affordable housing in Westminster. While this change will be met by a wailing and gnashing of teeth amongst developers and estate agents, there has to be a chance that mere mortals will be able to dream of living in zone 1. An overdue and welcome development. Two cheers for Westminster council. A pity that they didn\u2019t make a start on this a decade ago.\u201d The proposals are subject to six weeks\u2019 consultation. The ban would not apply to homes that had been split up into flats and were being converted back into a single family house. Earlier this year, the council introduced a voluntary \u201cwealth tax\u201d, asking its richest residents to pay double council tax in order to help tackle the homelessness crisis in the heart of London. However, nine months after launching the \u00a3833-a-year \u201ccommunity contribution\u201d, just 2.5% of the borough\u2019s 15,600 wealthiest households had agreed to pay extra. The scheme has raised \u00a3400,000 to help rough sleepers. Those asked to consider making an extra contribution include the residents of the Candy brothers\u2019 luxurious One Hyde Park apartment complex in Knightsbridge.",

      "bodyText": "Premier Foods is in talks to sell its Ambrosia brand as the group announced that its chief executive, Gavin Darby, is to leave the company in January, months after a spat with activist investors. The company behind brands including Oxo and Angel Delight also revealed it was stockpiling ingredients in order to protect the company against the risk of delays at ports should the UK crash out of the EU next March without a deal. Darby said the firm was ramping up its stocks of imported goods such as dried egg powder and packaging to ensure a consistent supply of its products. The move could cost the firm \u00a310m in working capital over the next few months, which it expects would be reversed \u201cas the situation normalises\u201d. \u201cIn the absence of certainty over the arrangements for the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, the group shortly intends to start a process of building stocks of raw materials to protect the company against the risk of delays at ports,\u201d the firm said. The foods group said it was \u201cin discussions with a number of interested parties\u201d about the sale of Ambrosia, its custard and rice pudding brand originally created in 1971 in Lifton, Devon, and still manufactured there today with about 300 employees. Ambrosia accounts for about 10% of group revenues, with annual sales of the brand of about \u00a380m. Premier said a sale of Ambrosia would allow the firm to focus on its growing brands, such as Batchelors and Mr Kipling, and to accelerate the rate at which it pays down its \u00a3510m debt. Darby said the decision had been made to sell Ambrosia rather than an alternative brand, partly because it was a standalone factory and therefore easier to detach from the rest of the business. Darby, who received a \u00a31.2m pay package last year, has been chief executive for six years. He said he would step down on 31 January as the company took on a new strategy. \u201cThe board has determined that it should focus resources on areas of the business which have the best potential for growth through accelerated investment in consumer marketing and high-return capital projects,\u201d he said. In July Darby faced a shareholder revolt after 41% failed to back his re-election. At a stormy annual meeting, the activist shareholder Oasis Management called on Darby to step down regardless of the outcome of the vote, accusing him of driving Premier into a \u201czombie-like state\u201d because of his failure to drive growth. Darby, however, secured the backing of a majority of shareholders and the board. The company announced his departure alongside the firm\u2019s first-half results. Pretax losses in the six months to 29 September widened to \u00a32.2m from \u00a31.2m in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.3% to \u00a3358m, boosted by the relaunch of the Mr Kipling cakes brand and by growing demand for Premier\u2019s Batchelors convenience pots range, as it rolls out snacking options across its brands. Premier Foods said Mr Kipling had a \u201cstorming\u201d first half, with revenue up 13% after a revamp that included an updated brand logo, improved packaging and TV advertising, as well as new product development such as Unicorn and Flamingo slices. Darby said food brands had largely been protected from a wider slowdown in consumer spending. He said the UK was at an unusual point in the economic cycle, with record levels of employment but weakening consumer confidence. \u201cTypically, when consumers feel more cautious and confidence is low, people eat out a little less and eat at home a little more. It tends to be good for the grocery business,\u201d he said. He added that wage growth was now beginning to outpace inflation, reversing the previous trend, and purchasing power for consumers had strengthened.",

      "bodyText": "Five British companies have failed to appoint a single woman to their boards more than two years after the government ordered the UK\u2019s 350 biggest firms to ensure that women hold at least a third of boardroom positions by 2020. A further 75 companies were on Tuesday highlighted by the Hampton-Alexander review of UK boardroom diversity for appointing only one woman to their boards in a \u201ctokenistic gesture\u201d. Sir Philip Hampton, chair of the government-commissioned review, called on consumers to boycott the firms that are \u201cso clearly out of touch\u201d. Hampton, a City grandee and chairman of the pharmaceuticals company GlaxoSmithKline, told the Guardian that politicians, the media and consumers need to put \u201chuman pressure\u201d on firms that are damaging the reputation of corporate Britain. The five FTSE 350-listed companies with all-male boards are Millennium &amp; Copthorne, which operates 120 hotels across the world; Daejan Holdings, which owns a string of office properties including Africa House in London\u2019s Holborn; Amigo Holdings, which provides 49% APR loans; and the investment trusts Herald Investment and JP Morgan Japanese Investment. Amigo appointed a woman to its board last Thursday but is not included in the Hampton-Alexander figures because the decision missed the deadline. \u201cThey are so clearly out of touch,\u201d Hampton said of the five companies. \u201cAnd it would be good to see pressure from the media, politicians, ourselves [other business leaders] and consumers.\u201d Hampton said that while it would be hard for consumers to apply pressure on investment trusts, they could avoid staying at Millennium &amp; Copthorne hotels. The FTSE 250 company, which is majority-owned by the Singaporean billionaire Kwek Leng Beng, owns hotels and resorts in 79 countries and is the official partner hotel of Chelsea Football Club. A spokesperson for Millennium declined to comment. The reasons chairmen and chief executives have cited for failing to appoint more women included: \u201cI don\u2019t think women fit comfortably into the board environment\u201d; \u201cMost women don\u2019t want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board\u201d; and \u201cAll the \u2018good\u2019 women have already been snapped up\u201d. Hampton said that while it was a deep concern that five FTSE 350 companies still had all-male boards, it was a considerable improvement on 152 all-male boards in 2011. Also, FTSE 100 companies are on track to meet the target of having 30% of board positions occupied by women by 2020. In 2011, only 12.5% of FTSE 100 boardroom positions were held by women. Denise Wilson, the chief executive of the Hampton-Alexander review, said that as well as the firms that still had all-male boards she wanted to highlight 75 companies that have only one woman on their boards. \u201cSome of them have been in that tokenistic place for some time and we are shining a light on them,\u201d Wilson said. Included among the 75 with only one woman on the board is Melrose, the FTSE 100 turnaround specialist that took over the historic engineering company GKN. Hampton also highlighted the London Stock Exchange Group, which operates the UK and Italian stock exchanges, for having only two women on its board. \u201cYou would expect a business like that to be setting a better example,\u201d he said. Even at companies where there were several women on the board, Hampton said women were more often in non-executive rather than executive roles and were very rarely the chief executive or chair. There are only six female CEOs in the FTSE 100, an increase of one since 2011. Among the wider FTSE 350 there are only 12 female CEOs, which is a decrease from 15 last year and 18 the year before. There are only 22 female chairs in the FTSE 350. Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said: \u201cThe infamous five companies who still have all-male boards need to drag themselves into the 21st century and recruit a more valuable and diverse viewpoint than the current old-boys club set-up. When nearly one in four firms only have one woman on their board, it\u2019s clear that many of our biggest companies still have a long way to go. Business culture needs to change rapidly, to challenge existing stereotypes and to realise the positive impact on performance of greater diversity.\u201d Four FTSE 100 companies \u2013 the retailer Next, the online estate agent Rightmove, the financial services provider Hargreaves Lansdown and the builder Taylor Wimpey \u2013 have 50% or more women on their boards. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said: \u201cMany businesses have championed gender diversity, building on our modern industrial strategy\u2019s ambition to ensure everyone can progress in the workplace. If companies are not diverse they are missing out on the benefits that a diverse workforce brings. Sadly, other companies are lagging behind and I want to see all of those companies do more to increase the number of women at the top.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world has so many existing fossil fuel projects that it cannot afford to build any more polluting infrastructure without busting international climate change goals, the global energy watchdog has warned. The International Energy Agency said almost all of the world\u2019s carbon budget up to 2040 \u2013 the amount that can be emitted without causing dangerous warming \u2013 would be eaten up by today\u2019s power stations, vehicles and industrial facilities. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the Paris-based group, told the Guardian: \u201cWe have no room to build anything that emits CO2 emissions.\u201d The economist said to limit temperature rises to 2C, let alone the 1.5C as scientists recommend, either all new energy projects would have to be low carbon, which was unlikely, or existing infrastructure would need to be cleaned up. That could include incentives for dirty power plants to be retired early or installing carbon capture and storage technologies, Birol said. \u201cWe are eating up 95% of the [carbon] budget, even if we don\u2019t do anything else. Which of course is impossible, not building any more trucks or power plants,\u201d Birol said. In total, the IEA calculated that existing infrastructure would \u201clock in\u201d 550 gigatonnes of of carbon dioxide over the next 22 years. That leaves only 40 gigatonnes, or around a year\u2019s worth of emissions, of wriggle room if temperatures are not to overshoot the 2C threshold. The group\u2019s annual World Energy Outlook, published on Tuesday, revised future CO2 emissions upwards on last year\u2019s report. Global emissions from energy flatlined in 2014-16 after decades of increases but in 2017 and 2018 so far they have resumed their upward march. The IEA expects CO2 emissions to rise from 32.53 gigatonnes in 2017 to 36 gigatonnes by 2040. Birol said that unfortunately the data suggested 2014-16 was a blip, rather than 2017-18. \u201cThere is a growing disconnect between the new international [climate] research and what is happening in the energy market,\u201d he said. The report said that the world is \u201cstill a long way\u201d from meeting its goals on climate change and air pollution. However, the IEA is upbeat about how much greener the power market will become. Windfarms are expected to grow from 4% to 12% of global electricity generation by 2040, overtaking nuclear. Solar is forecast to expand from 2% of generation today to nearly 10% by 2040 and is expected to outcompete new coal plants on cost \u201calmost everywhere\u201d. Hydro power will remain the biggest source of low carbon electricity generation, at 15% in 2040. Battery storage costs are also expected to decline rapidly. But the report expects that beyond electricity generation, fossil fuels will continue to dominate energy use. Planes, ships and industry are not yet \u201celectric-ready\u201d with today\u2019s technology, the IEA said. Overall, the world\u2019s appetite for energy is expected to grow by a quarter by 2040 because of an extra 1.7 billion people, growing affluence and a shift in demand from the west to Asia. Birol said he was disappointed that recent high oil prices had resulted in some countries, such as India, Indonesia and Thailand, taking backward steps on cutting the trillions of pounds of fossil fuel subsidies awarded each year by governments. \u201cThis is definitely not a good move. It is putting a lot of pressure on government budgets,\u201d he said. The World Energy Outlook noted that by mid-2018, when oil prices were hovering just below $80 a barrel, there had been \u201csigns of a slowdown in reform efforts\u201d. The IEA said it was concerned about the prospect of a crunch in oil supply in the next decade. \u201cThe oil markets I believe are entering a renewed period of uncertainty and volatility. One of the things that worries me is the links between energy and geopolitics are getting tighter and more complex,\u201d Birol said.",

      "bodyText": "The TV production company behind Poldark and Vanity Fair has bought the rights to a critical biography of Sir Philip Green. The life of the clothing tycoon, who controls Arcadia Group, the owner of Topshop, could be turned into a high-profile drama about how power and finance works in the UK \u2013 and how it affects people when high street shops close. But the production company Mammoth Screen has been grappling with how to cover Green\u2019s recent return to the headlines. He has spent hundreds of thousands with the law firm Schillings to fight an attempt to name him as the prominent businessman who had allegedly paid substantial sums to staff in exchange for their silence. A Green drama would probably focus on his rise from the London rag trade to national prominence as the deal-making chairman of Arcadia Group, before taking in the chaos surrounding his botched decision to sell the British Home Stores chain to a former bankrupt racing driver for \u00a31 shortly before it collapsed. The series would face the prospect of knotty legal challenges from Green, whose recent battle with the Telegraph has still not fully played out in the courts. The producers said they would look at including coverage of Green\u2019s non-disclosure agreements, but needed to make sure \u201cwe\u2019re not pressing the button too soon because it takes a while for these things to evolve and the truth to emerge\u201d. Attempts to keep Green\u2019s name out of the media collapsed last month when Peter Hain, speaking in the House of Lords, used parliamentary privilege to name him as the businessman responsible for the injunction, prompting new demands that Green should be stripped of his knighthood. A former Arcadia insider later told the Guardian that Green had given multiple seven-figure payouts to staff who had made allegations of sexual harassment or bullying while working for the tycoon. Other women have since come forward to with harassment claims. Mammoth Screen bought the rights to the biography \u2013 Damaged Goods by Sunday Times business editor Oliver Shah \u2013 before the latest round of claims about Green\u2019s behaviour became public. The deal was first reported by the Radio Times and the production company has been in talks with broadcasters who are interested in making the series. Tom Leggett, an executive producer at Mammoth Screen, said it was interested in the story because it told a parable about the \u201cwider ecosystem of the government, politics, media and how Philip Green was created by a system that involved collusion between big business and journalists who propped it up\u201d. He added: \u201cThis type of people were presented in the 80s and 90s as being the image of great British entrepreneurship and we should all aspire to that. Then to discover it\u2019s all corrupt is a fascinating betrayal. Everyone is complicit in creating these people.\u201d The production company has been in discussions with a potential scriptwriter but said it wanted to keep the drama\u2019s focus on how people were affected by the fall of BHS. The high street chain collapsed with an enormous hole in its pension fund \u2013 which Green later filled after an outcry, but many former employees remain out of work and shop units sit empty on high streets across the country. Leggett said he bought the rights after reading a review of Shah\u2019s book in the Guardian: \u201cThe point is not to make a salacious exploitative piece. What makes Oliver\u2019s book so good is that it really is a very measured and intelligent look at big business. The idea of doing a drama about it is not about trying to grab headlines but to give a genuine insight into the way these companies have risen over the last few years.\u201d Green has different views on the book, saying that the only reason he had not sued Shah over its publication was that \u201che\u2019s a cheap hooker who couldn\u2019t afford to pay damages anyway\u201d. \u201cIf he was an expensive hooker, I\u2019d sue,\u201d he said earlier this year. Despite this, Shah said he still talked to Green on a regular basis about stories: \u201cHe\u2019ll ring up and say \u2018I\u2019m not to read that fucking book but when the movie gets made I\u2019m going to make it myself\u2019. I rang him up on Friday and he said \u2018why do you always want to fuck everything up?\u2019\u201d The journalist speculated on which actors could be approached to play the 66-year-old businessman on screen: \u201cI wish Bob Hoskins was still around but I could go for Ray Winstone.\u201d Arcadia Group did not return a request for comment.",
