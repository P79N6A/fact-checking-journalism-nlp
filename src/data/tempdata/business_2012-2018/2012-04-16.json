      "body": "<p>The World Bank named Korean-born doctor Jim Yong Kim as its new president today amid criticism that the role had once more gone to a US-nominated candidate.</p> <p>The 52-year-old president of Ivy League Dartmouth College beat Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to the post, the first time in the World Bank's history that the US candidate has faced a serious challenge.</p> <p>Kim had been widely expected to clinch the job, as he had the backing of the US, Europe, Japan and Canada, which between them command a majority of votes among the World Bank's executive directors. But sources close to the process claimed there had been \"frantic arm-twisting\" in a bid to achieve unanimity.</p> <p>Insiders claimed Okonjo-Iweala was urged to stand down on Sunday night after it emerged she could muster 19% of the votes, because senior Bank decision-makers felt it would expose divisions among its member states. Instead, the Nigerian finance minister insisted on remaining in the race.</p> <p>Before the announcement, Okonjo-Iweala said: \"You know this thing is not really being decided on merit.\"</p> <p>Brazilian and South African government officials reiterated their support for her on Monday \u2013 potentially representing about 5% of the votes at the meeting. It is understood that there was no formal vote.</p> <p>Kim, born in Seoul, South Korea, was nominated by Barack Obama in March to replace current president Robert Zoellick. The US president's choice of a public health expert was a surprise: candidates nominated to run the bank usually come from the financial world.</p> <p>The presidency has gone to a US candidate since the organisation was founded at the Bretton Woods conference at the close of the second world war. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), its sister organisation, has always been run by a European.</p> <p>The US gave its backing to Frenchwoman Christine Lagarde's nomination to the top role at the IMF last year after the shock resignation of Dominique Strauss Kahn.

      "bodyText": "The World Bank named Korean-born doctor Jim Yong Kim as its new president today amid criticism that the role had once more gone to a US-nominated candidate. The 52-year-old president of Ivy League Dartmouth College beat Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to the post, the first time in the World Bank's history that the US candidate has faced a serious challenge. Kim had been widely expected to clinch the job, as he had the backing of the US, Europe, Japan and Canada, which between them command a majority of votes among the World Bank's executive directors. But sources close to the process claimed there had been \"frantic arm-twisting\" in a bid to achieve unanimity. Insiders claimed Okonjo-Iweala was urged to stand down on Sunday night after it emerged she could muster 19% of the votes, because senior Bank decision-makers felt it would expose divisions among its member states. Instead, the Nigerian finance minister insisted on remaining in the race. Before the announcement, Okonjo-Iweala said: \"You know this thing is not really being decided on merit.\" Brazilian and South African government officials reiterated their support for her on Monday \u2013 potentially representing about 5% of the votes at the meeting. It is understood that there was no formal vote. Kim, born in Seoul, South Korea, was nominated by Barack Obama in March to replace current president Robert Zoellick. The US president's choice of a public health expert was a surprise: candidates nominated to run the bank usually come from the financial world. The presidency has gone to a US candidate since the organisation was founded at the Bretton Woods conference at the close of the second world war. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), its sister organisation, has always been run by a European. The US gave its backing to Frenchwoman Christine Lagarde's nomination to the top role at the IMF last year after the shock resignation of Dominique Strauss Kahn. In return, Kim received Europe's backing for the World Bank job. In recent years, the organisations have faced growing criticism over their US/European duopoly. Before Kim was confirmed as bank president, the South African finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, said there was a need to \"look beyond the verbiage of democracy and the claims to democratic process and ask whether in substantive terms the institution has met the democratic test\". Although she had always expected her challenge to the US's nomination to fail, Okonjo-Iweala said: \"It is voting with political weight and shares, and therefore the United States will get it.\" She added: \"We have won important victories ... We have shown what is possible. Our credible and merit-based challenge to a long-standing and unfair tradition will ensure the process of choosing a World Bank president will never be the same again. The hands of the clock cannot be turned back.\" Welcoming the selection of Kim, Obama said the process had been \"open and transparent\" and praised the winning candidate as an inclusive leader. \"I appreciate the strong support offered to Dr Kim from leaders around the world,\" Obama said. A third candidate, Colombia's former finance minister Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo, pulled out on Friday, calling the process a \"political-oriented exercise\". Peter Chowla, co-ordinator of London-based NGO the Bretton Woods Project, said the news meant the \"stitch-up between the US and Europe will live on into a seventh decade despite the rise of new economic powers like India, China and Brazil\". He added: \"European and other rich world leaders chose political convenience over a truly competitive process that would look at the candidates on the basis of their merits and not their nationalities.

      "bodyText": "Argentina sent shock waves through the oil industry by announcing plans to nationalise local oil assets controlled by a Spanish company, in a controversial move that threatens to sour the already troubled relationship between the two countries. The move to seize 51% of Repsol's YPF business in Argentina sent the company's shares spinning down 18% on Wall Street and will worry other big foreign investors such as BP. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Argentina's president, introduced the new measure to Congress in a bid to recover sovereignty over its national hydrocarbon resources. Kirchner accused Repsol of failing to produce enough oil through YPF to meet Argentina's energy requirements.

Economic and political interest in the country's hydrocarbons has rocketed since the end of last year when YPF announced it had discovered a shale oil site that could potentially yield 1bn barrels. Politicians have accused Repsol of failing to invest enough in future production at a time when the high cost of oil is undermining the country's economy. The nationalisation comes amid escalating threats against operators drilling for oil off the disputed Falkland Islands. Argentina is expected to expropriate about 24% of YPF from Repsol and another 26% from Argentina's Peterson Group at a price yet to be determined by the government.

      "body": "<p>The Jaeger fashion brand has been sold in a rescue deal as the retail empire built by one of the UK's best known rag traders unravels in the high street downturn.</p> <p>Harold Tillman, who is chairman of the British Fashion Council, sold the business to distressed debt expert Jon Moulton's Better Capital for just under \u00a320m with \"substantial majority\" used to settle its debts. Moulton is best known for his failed attempt to rescue another historic British brand, MG Rover.</p> <p>Tillman is also locked in talks about the future of one of his other investments, the loss-making Aquascutum clothing brand, which he has owned since 2009.</p> <p>In its heyday, Jaeger dressed Audrey Hepburn and the Duchess of Windsor, but by the 1990s it was more country set than jet set. When Tillman acquired it for an undisclosed sum in 2003 it had been losing money for several years. He drafted in former Debenhams chief executive Belinda Earl to lead the turnaround and appeared to be making progress thanks to more fashionable products and new ranges such as the upmarket Jaeger London brand, which it shows on the catwalk. But the success proved to be short-lived; in its last set of published accounts, for the year to the end of February 2011, operating profits had more than halved to just \u00a31.4m on sales of \u00a394m. At that time the company warned \"the impact from falling consumer confidence is proving challenging\".

      "bodyText": "The Jaeger fashion brand has been sold in a rescue deal as the retail empire built by one of the UK's best known rag traders unravels in the high street downturn. Harold Tillman, who is chairman of the British Fashion Council, sold the business to distressed debt expert Jon Moulton's Better Capital for just under \u00a320m with \"substantial majority\" used to settle its debts. Moulton is best known for his failed attempt to rescue another historic British brand, MG Rover. Tillman is also locked in talks about the future of one of his other investments, the loss-making Aquascutum clothing brand, which he has owned since 2009. In its heyday, Jaeger dressed Audrey Hepburn and the Duchess of Windsor, but by the 1990s it was more country set than jet set. When Tillman acquired it for an undisclosed sum in 2003 it had been losing money for several years. He drafted in former Debenhams chief executive Belinda Earl to lead the turnaround and appeared to be making progress thanks to more fashionable products and new ranges such as the upmarket Jaeger London brand, which it shows on the catwalk. But the success proved to be short-lived; in its last set of published accounts, for the year to the end of February 2011, operating profits had more than halved to just \u00a31.4m on sales of \u00a394m. At that time the company warned \"the impact from falling consumer confidence is proving challenging\". People familiar with its more recent performance said the picture had deteriorated since then with the retailer likely to be loss-making this year. Better Capital specialises in company turnarounds and last month bought double glazing firm Everest. With debt of \u00a313.4m and climbing this time last year, its intervention enabled Jaeger's lender, Bank of Scotland, part of the state-backed Lloyds Banking Group, to be repaid and the company to survive. \"The board is pleased that Jaeger has a new owner in Better Capital, thereby securing the future of the business,\" the retailer said in a statement. \"The investment that Better Capital has provided will create a strong foundation.\" Tillman's stake in Jaeger has been cut from 70% to 10% but he will stay on as chairman. The deal was done swiftly with Moulton only starting to study the numbers \"about a week ago\" but he said: \"The potential is obviously there.

Spain's Ibex 35-share index fell to 7245, down from February's 2012-high of 8902.</p> <p>Lyn Graham-Taylor, a Rabobank strategist, said: \"We're back in full crisis mode. It is looking more and more likely that Spain is going to have some form of a bailout.\"</p> <p>Across Europe, markets recovered some of the losses from sharp falls last week. The FTSE 100 was up 37 points at 5689 after a drop to 5579 on Wednesday.</p> <p>Worries about Spanish bank loans to the beleaguered construction sector, bankrupt property developers and \u20ac50bn (\u00a341.2bn) of outstanding debts in Portugal have unnerved investors.</p> <p>Markets are almost shut to some of Spain's 17 regions, so their best hope of financing deficit spending and rolling over debt is Rajoy's administration, which has passed tough new laws giving it the right to intervene in the regional governments.</p> <p>Government sources said the new law meant the regions, which control 37% of Spain's public spending, could be forced to impose greater austerity to meet the deficit targets they missed so spectacularly in 2011.</p> <p>The regions, which run health, education and other essential services, were largely responsible for Spain's failure to bring its deficit under control last year, leaving investors and other eurozone countries worried that they had become untameable.</p> <p>Rajoy may find himself in the politically embarrassing position of having to intervene in regions run by his own conservative People's party. The eastern Valencia region has had its debt downgraded to junk status and central Castile-La Mancha must find a way to cut its deficit from 7.3% of regional GDP to the government's 1.5% target this year.</p> <p>Other potential targets include the country's largest region, southern Andaluc\u00eda, where the caretaker socialist administration was accused by officials in Madrid of hiding debt.

      "bodyText": "The conservative Spanish government of Mariano Rajoy expects to take direct financial control of at least one of the country's ailing regional governments by May, according to sources in Madrid. With some regional debt already downgraded to junk, senior officials said it would be the regional governments themselves that came to Madrid to beg for help to get through the year. \"It wouldn't be surprising if this happened in May,\" said a high-ranking official. \"Some are paying interest rates that are impossible.\" International lenders are expected to welcome the plans after a series of warnings about the deteriorating state of the Spanish economy. Government borrowing costs jumped above 6% on Monday as foreign investors expressed their growing fears for Rajoy's administration and the prospect of a major default. The rate, or yield, on the country's 10-year government bonds hit 6.1%, the highest since December. Spain's Ibex 35-share index fell to 7245, down from February's 2012-high of 8902. Lyn Graham-Taylor, a Rabobank strategist, said: \"We're back in full crisis mode. It is looking more and more likely that Spain is going to have some form of a bailout.\" Across Europe, markets recovered some of the losses from sharp falls last week. The FTSE 100 was up 37 points at 5689 after a drop to 5579 on Wednesday. Worries about Spanish bank loans to the beleaguered construction sector, bankrupt property developers and \u20ac50bn (\u00a341.2bn) of outstanding debts in Portugal have unnerved investors. Markets are almost shut to some of Spain's 17 regions, so their best hope of financing deficit spending and rolling over debt is Rajoy's administration, which has passed tough new laws giving it the right to intervene in the regional governments. Government sources said the new law meant the regions, which control 37% of Spain's public spending, could be forced to impose greater austerity to meet the deficit targets they missed so spectacularly in 2011. The regions, which run health, education and other essential services, were largely responsible for Spain's failure to bring its deficit under control last year, leaving investors and other eurozone countries worried that they had become untameable. Rajoy may find himself in the politically embarrassing position of having to intervene in regions run by his own conservative People's party. The eastern Valencia region has had its debt downgraded to junk status and central Castile-La Mancha must find a way to cut its deficit from 7.3% of regional GDP to the government's 1.5% target this year. Other potential targets include the country's largest region, southern Andaluc\u00eda, where the caretaker socialist administration was accused by officials in Madrid of hiding debt. Local officials have vigorously denied the claim and invited EU inspectors to scrutinise the accounts. A new Andalusian government, led by the socialists and backed by the communist-led United Left party, is expected to be formed soon following last month's regional elections. Government sources said any attempt at rebellion by Andaluc\u00eda against the strict 1.5% deficit target would be met with intervention. Sources said the government was willing to share the political unpopularity of higher regional taxes or cuts in health and education. Over the next fortnight the government will pass measures allowing the regions to adjust their spending, mainly with cuts, on health and education by some \u20ac10bn a year. Regional government budgets must be approved by next month. Fellow eurozone countries have told Spain, which is now seen as the greatest threat to the common currency, to slash its deficit from 8.5% to 5.3% this year in what will be one of Europe's most stringent austerity programmes. Rajoy's government has announced \u20ac27bn of cuts in central government spending, but the biggest worry remains the regions \u2013 which, despite urging by the former socialist government of Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero \u2013 failed to cut their deficit at all last year. To make Matters worse, Spain's finance minister, Luis de Guindos, admitted on Monday that the country, whose economy is projected to shrink by 1.7% this year, had entered recession in the first quarter. De Guindos said a stability programme agreed with Brussels would force Spain to cut its structural deficit to 3.5% of GDP this year. The structural deficit is the shortfall in a country's finances that is not explained by cyclical factors such as booms and downturns. He said that the structural deficit ballooned from a projected 4.7% to 7% last year. \"In structural terms, we are going to compensate for the adjustment that should have been made last year, and the one we are committed to for this year,\" De Guindos said.",

The influential shareholder advisory body ISS has been told by the bank that the liability could recur for up to 10 years \u2013 the period over which the state of New York, where Diamond had been resident before moving back to the UK, is able to retrospectively look at taxes. As has already been reported here, the \u00a35.7m tax liability has arisen on a personal tax bill of something closer to \u00a32.5m that would have been incurred by the American-born banker when he left the US after 18 months to come back to London, his home for most of the previous 20 years. The total rose because the bank had to cover Diamond's income tax and national insurance on the benefit as well. Barclays has explained to ISS that the tax charge could not be offset by a double taxation treaty, because while there is a double tax treaty between the US federal government and the UK government, this does not operate at a state level. In the state of New York, \"local tax laws examine income and capital gains over a retrospective 10-year period\", ISS said in its advice to clients ahead of next week's annual meeting. As the matter was highlighted in Diamond's contract when he was appointed chief executive, ISS is not recommending a vote against the remuneration report. Even so, this is clearly going to run and run \u2013 and, interestingly, ISS also reports the treatment of Diamond \"is in line with the company's overall treatment of expats\".",

      "bodyText": "America's banks are bigger than ever. JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have emerged with more firepower than before the financial crisis following Hank Paulson's generous bailouts and the freedom to swallow rivals on the cheap. According to the Federal Reserve the big five held $8.5 trillion (\u00a35.4tn) in assets at the end of 2011. This enormous hoard, much of it in loans on commercial property or to foreign corporations, is equal to 56% of the US economy. In 2007, ahead of the financial crisis, the largest banks' assets amounted to a still large, but healthier, 43% of US output. With only a very brief lull in 2008 and 2009 to check their progress, the big five have grown in every other year of the last decade to double in size. Arguably, along with Washington's unprecedented rescue of Ford, GM and Chrysler, the renaissance of the major banks is behind the US economy's recovery. For several years the US treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, lectured Europe on the need to rescue banks as a prerequisite for rescuing economies. Without a massive injection of cash, a co-ordinated guarantee scheme and a monster dumping ground for the bank's most toxic assets, foreign investors would look elsewhere. Worse, a constrained banking sector would discourage domestic companies from investing. Look at the US economy now. While it may be cooling a little, the figures for growth and employment are streets ahead of anything the UK and Brussels can claim. US retail sales were up again in March after an increase in February, according to the latest figures. In the UK and continental Europe the consumer is struggling to stay afloat. When the eurocrats worry about youth employment, Geithner says they should look no further than the pathetic self-flagellating treatment of the banks, which remain hamstrung by excessive regulation and poorly designed and generally puny rescue packages. Late in the day, it is a message that has sunk in at the Bank of England and some more thoughtful areas of European policymaking. The only route to growth is sorting out the finances of the banks and letting them lend again. Taxpayers are the only source of funds and should, like their US counterparts, bite the bullet. It's why the Germans, French and Dutch need to agree a \u20ac2tn (\u00a31.6tn) bailout fund to kill off fears that the safety net for Spain, Portugal and Italy is insufficient. But Geithner has also created a monster that after only three years of recovery is already too big to fail. Without subsequent reforms, JP Morgan and the others will sow the seeds of the next crash. Their assets will be found again to be toxic and while the accounting may be clearer, there will still be lots of toxic loans to deal with. It is a dilemma that is hard to escape. Barack Obama vowed to eliminate the possibility of the financial sector being too big to fail. Rightly he put growth first, but there is no doubting that restraining banks is harder once they have recovered their powers and legitimacy. It will be a severe test for the next administration.

The comments will send a shockwave through Whitehall because they come just weeks after the German utilities RWE and E.ON said they would not proceed with plans to build new nuclear plants at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. The German firms run the Horizon joint venture in Britain. They cited concerns about financing the projects as well as costs associated with Germany's abandonment of nuclear power in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident in Japan. This would leave only GDF and the major French electricity producer EDF in the race to build new atomic plants in the UK. GDF has its own joint venture with Iberdrola of Spain called NuGen which insisted after the E.ON and RWE announcement that it remained \"committed\" to its planned 3.6 gigawatt plant at Sellafield. But Mestrallet's words make clear that GDF will only proceed if the British government makes further concessions to nuclear, something industry critics feared would happen. The GDF warning came as the French grip on Britain's energy infrastructure tightened with a plan to take full control of International Power (IP) for about \u00a36.5bn. IP operates key power stations around the country including the gas-fired plant at Satend near Hull and a coal-fired facility at Rugely, in Staffordshire, as well as many others abroad. The move could exacerbate concerns about the undue influence of companies partly owned by the French state such as EDF, Areva and GDF \u2013 which have already big stakes in the British energy market. The French government is the biggest shareholder in GDF with 36%. GDF, the world's largest independent power producer, bought 70% of IP in 2010, but has now agreed to buy the remaining stake for 418p a share. Mestrallet said the acquisition of the minority stake in IP constituted a major step that would \"allow the group to fully capture growth in fast growing markets\". He denied further control by GDF of the UK business could be anything but good and said EDF was a \"competitor\" not a French state collaborator. An earlier offer from GDF at 390p a share had been resisted by the British company's board but Sir Neville Sims, chairman of the committee of independent directors at IP, said he had no difficulty recommending the new offer. It represented a price that \"fairly reflects the company's position in international power generation markets and its inherent growth potential,\" he said. The independent directors will recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the deal at the annual meeting on 15 May. The deal would be the second biggest this year after Glencore International's offer for mining group Xstrata. Angelos Anastasiou, a utility analyst with Investec Securities, said this was the right price for a business of this sort, adding: \"We see the offer progressing smoothly to its conclusion.\" But the acquisition by GDF follows the purchase by EDF of nuclear operator British Energy and the growing influence of French nuclear engineering firm, Areva. Jonathon Porritt, director of sustainability group Forum for the Future, recently expressed deep misgivings about the situation.
