    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hedge funds like the sort of stock market volatility predicted this week by a US investment bank: Morgan Stanley claimed that if the UK votes to leave the European Union, shares in the FTSE 100 could underperform by 20%. In the hedge fund industry based in London\u2019s Mayfair, that prospect has profit potential. Any drastic movement in the share prices of Britain\u2019s biggest listed companies could be a trigger for hedge fund managers to perform a classic manoeuvre: making profits by betting on slumping share prices. Known as shorting, a fund borrows shares from a City investor who charges a fee for the service. The fund then sells the shares in the expectation of buying them back more cheaply when the price falls, and then returning them to their rightful owner. The difference between the two prices is pocketed as a profit by the hedge fund. But the prospect of some profitable trading is not the key reason why many of those in the hedge fund business \u2013 led by billionaires Crispin Odey and Sir Michael Hintze \u2013 are backing Brexit. Most of the big City firms and institutions \u2013 from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to the Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market and the City of London Corporation \u2013 believe Britain is better off staying in the EU. Leaving, they argue, would endanger the status of the City as Europe\u2019s financial centre, and growth prospects across the wider economy. But many of the Mayfair-based hedgies have no such worries and are backing Brexit with both words and cash. They have clear professional reasons why they want the UK to leave the EU: a dislike for what they regard as overburdensome \u2013 and profit-reducing \u2013 regulation. According to one source close to the industry: \u201cI think there\u2019s a genuine conviction they have that all regulation is rubbish.\u201d But, he says, the profit potential from leaving is also a factor: \u201cThey love taking a view ... Market dislocation is fine if you\u2019re a hedge fund guy.\u201d Hintze, a major Tory donor who founded the hedge fund CQS in 1999, backs the out campaign group Business for Britain and is said to be considering a donation to the Vote Leave campaign. Odey, the founder of Odey Asset Management, is also a backer of Vote Leave. Odey, however, dismisses the view that hedge fund backers of the anti-Europe campaign are doing it out of self-interest and insists his opposition pre-dates the flood of regulation that followed the 2008 financial crash. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing scary for hedge funds per se from Brussels,\u201d he says. Odey also maintains that not all hedge fund managers are anti-Europe: \u201cThe hedge fund industry is not a union or in any way homogeneous.\u201d There are other out campaigners from another sector of the City not dissimilar to the hedge fund industry: spread betting. These firms also allow people to make bets on share price movements without actually owning the stock \u2013 and like hedge fund owners, a spread better can make a fortune from an economic shock. Anti-EU supporters from the spread betting industry include Peter Cruddas, the founder and chief executive of CMC Markets, and Stuart Wheeler, the founder of rival spread betting firm IG Group. Those who have studied the funding plans for both sides of the referendum campaign believe the Vote Leave group already has \u00a33m-\u00a35m at its disposal. The rush to raise money is intense because there is no limit to what is allowable before the referendum officially gets under way. Once the date for the referendum is called, there is a \u00a37m spending cap for both the in and out campaigns. Sir Michael Hintze The hedge fund manager, who is said to be worth around \u00a31.2bn, is widely believed to be considering a big donation to the Vote Leave campaign. A major philanthropist, he has given \u00a33.2m to the Conservative party over the last 10 years. He and his wife have donated \u00a35m to the Natural History Museum in south Kensington \u2013 the largest single gift the museum has received in 133 years \u2013 and they have also given \u00a32.5m to the National Gallery and made donations to the Old Vic, Oxford University, the University of Sydney and others. Hintze was born in China but left for Australia with his parents when he was a child and went to university in Sydney where he studied physics and engineering. He went into finance, and became head of equity trading at Goldman Sachs in London before starting up his hedge fund CQS in 1999. A former Goldman Sachs banker, he was caught up in the controversy that resulted in Liam Fox resigning as defence minister. During a furore over the extent to which Fox had benefited financially from private backers, it emerged that Hintze\u2019s company had been helping to fund some of the politician\u2019s activities. During a week of revelations about the links between Fox and his best man, Adam Werrity, it emerged that Werrity had the use of a desk at Hintze\u2019s offices in London. Crispin Odey Odey has backed the Vote Leave group financially, although he says he hasn\u2019t given a \u201clot of money\u201d. He says talk about hedge fund managers wanting to come out of Brussels because of the directives introduced after the financial crisis that might have affected their industry is \u201call crap\u201d. Briefly married to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s daughter Prudence, Odey says \u201cEurope hasn\u2019t exactly covered itself in glory\u201d. The Sunday Times estimated the joint wealth of Odey and his current wife, Nichola Pease, at around \u00a31.1bn as of April 2015 and since then he is believed to have made more than \u00a3200m from the fall in share prices on the volatile Chinese stock market. The Oxford-educated financier, who paid himself \u00a348m last year, warned in December that major economies were entering a recession that \u201cwill be remembered in 100 years\u201d. He described it as the best time to bet on shares slumping in value since the financial crisis.",

      "bodyText": "The British cucumber is facing extinction, the latest victim of a supermarket price war that has knocked retail prices down from up to 90p to less than 30p in some stores. According to the Cucumber Growers Association, production has plummeted to less than 100 hectares for the first time in nearly 100 years as farmers switch to more lucrative crops. \u201cNobody in the supply chain is making anything from the production and sale of cucumbers. Without an increase in returns the British cucumber industry won\u2019t be endangered \u2013 it will be extinct,\u201d the CGA told a National Farmers\u2019 Union report into the plight of British growers. A leading farmer who once sold 4m cucumbers a year has retired, while others have switched to strawberries and bedding plants instead. One former major cucumber grower has turned over his fields to medicinal cannabis as supermarkets demand lower prices or rely on cheaper imports from the Netherlands. Derek Hargreaves, technical officer of the CGA, said the average price paid to growers had dropped from about 28p a stick five years ago to about 22p. Production costs were usually about 20p \u2013 apart from at the height of summer when they fell to just 16p \u2013 leaving growers little profit margin, he said. \u201cIt would be unfair to say it\u2019s unprofitable, but if you are making a profit it\u2019s not much,\u201d Hargreaves said. Profit concerns meant growers were unable to invest in modernising or expanding, he said, adding that at least one grower had shut up shop after bankers stopped supporting the business. \u201cIt\u2019s not like prices have gone down and are now stable. They are still going down every year,\u201d he said. Farmers have come under pressure as the cucumber has found itself at the centre of price competition between the UK\u2019s four biggest supermarkets, which are struggling to stave off the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Last year, Tesco slashed the price of cucumbers from 65p to 49p after it made them a centrepiece of its new low-price promises to customers. Its ads declared: \u201cCucumbers are down and staying down.\u201d Asda\u2019s chief executive, Andy Clarke, said a decision to chop the price of cucumbers from 90p to 50p in 2013 triggered a 75% surge in sales, helping the retailer to shift 50m of them that year. Now all the main supermarkets are selling cucumbers for 49p, with Aldi and Lidl charging customers just 39p and 29p respectively this week. There used to be two major centres for cucumber growing in the UK - the East Riding of Yorkshire and Lea Valley in north London. But many farmers in Yorkshire have moved on. Joe Cappalonga, who runs G&amp;C Produce, a cucumber farm founded by his grandfather in Lea Valley, said: \u201cI\u2019m the third generation but I can\u2019t envisage a fourth generation the way things are going. The scariest thing is that retailers have totally devalued the cucumber. Prices are half what they were and what\u2019s scary is what happens next.\u201d Efficient cucumber growing required investment in technology to govern heating and water recirculation, he said, while the best growers were investing in energy plants which could help subsidise their costs. \u201cFinancing cucumbers is getting harder. There is no money to reinvest any more and so I don\u2019t know how long the future is,\u201d Cappalonga said.",

After the claims this week by the Vote Leave campaign, outgoing CBI boss John Cridland said his critics were avoiding the real policy issues in the in-out referendum debate. \u201cCBI takes these attacks as a badge of honour,\u201d Cridland told reporters at a briefing before its annual conference on Monday. \u201cIt goes with the job. If we are saying something that is important here and we land our messages and people need to respond to that, it\u2019s a sign we are saying something useful. \u201cIf I am disappointed about anything, it\u2019s simply that I am really up for debating the issues of the EU, the issues of Britain\u2019s place on the EU, on which I have a very strong mandate from our wide membership. It\u2019s not a consensus and I have never claimed it was a consensus \u2026 But I do have an overwhelming majority of businesses that want to be in a reformed EU.\u201d The prime minister, David Cameron, has promised a vote on EU membership by 2017. After the recent launch of official in and out campaigns, the CBI, which represents 190,000 businesses employing 7 million people, has signalled its determination to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU. The employers\u2019 body was subsequently accused by Vote Leave this week of misrepresenting the views of British businesses on EU membership and failing to adequately canvas smaller companies in a poll on the issue in 2013. Vote Leave has also published leaked minutes from a CBI meeting that it said showed the CBI\u2019s leadership had warned ministers not to \u201coverplay their hand\u201d in negotiations with Brussels. One Vote Leave member, Alan Halsall, the chairman of pram maker Silver Cross, said the revelations reinforced the case for the CBI withdrawing from the Brexit debate. \u201cThe CBI says one thing in public and another in private. It claims that it has been \u2018banging the drum\u2019 for reform in the EU but privately it warns ministers not to \u2018overplay their hand\u2019 in the negotiations,\u201d Halsall said this week. \u201cThe CBI should do the decent thing and drop its plans for a pro-EU campaign. If it does not it will be misrepresenting its members and the wider business community.\u201d The CBI also faced criticism this year from the business secretary, Sajid Javid, for weakening Cameron\u2019s hand as he prepared to negotiate with Brussels, by appearing to offer unconditional support for British membership. But Cridland said the CBI had been clear about the reforms it wanted in negotiations between the UK and other EU countries. Its priorities were more EU free trade deals with the rest of the world \u2013 such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership being negotiated with the US \u2013 as well as the creation of a \u201csingle digital market\u201d in Europe, which would make exports and transactions simpler. The CBI also wants less consumer and employment regulation. \u201cOur position is crystal clear and our mandate is crystal clear,\u201d Cridland said. \u201cI would just like to debate that with people rather than end up debating process or methodology. And I sometimes feel if people don\u2019t like the result, they blame the process.\u201d Cridland said the 2013 survey highlighted by Vote Leave was a \u201cvery small part\u201d of a \u201cvery major piece of work\u201d into the UK\u2019s membership of the EU.",

      "bodyText": "Janet Yellen\u2019s finger is poised over the button. The US Federal Reserve will finally take the plunge and raise interest rates when it meets again just before Christmas. The days when borrowing costs were kept at zero are coming to an end. That was the interpretation Wall Street was putting on Friday\u2019s news that the world\u2019s biggest economy created 271,000 extra jobs in October and, barring a big domestic or global crisis in the next month or so, it is almost certainly the correct one. The reason for the heightened speculation about a Fed tightening was that the employment news did not so much exceed expectations as smash them. After a couple of months in which employment growth had been disappointing, the markets were betting on non-farm payrolls \u2013 all sectors barring agriculture \u2013 increasing by 185,000 last month. The number of jobs created in September was revised down a bit, but that was more than compensated for by the October increase and by two other pieces of information that will make the Fed think the labour market is getting stronger. First, the unemployment rate edged down from 5.1% to 5%, within the range that the Fed categorises as full employment. Second, hourly wages were up by 0.4%, taking the year-on-year increase to 2.5%. That might not sound too impressive, and indeed is quite poor for a US economy now into the seventh year of recovery, but it is the strongest annual increase since 2009. If the Fed moves next month, the search will be on for the next major central bank to raise rates. Given that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are still increasing the amount of stimulus they are providing, every pronouncement by members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will be scrutinised. Threadneedle Street\u2019s quarterly inflation report on Thursday prompted some analysts to assume the MPC would delay raising rates until early 2017. Markets are sure to bring forward their expectations of the first move by the Bank to 2016, and perhaps the first half of the year at that. There is a risk for the Fed in all this. Aside from the exceptionally strong jobs data, the economic news from the US has not been all that special. Other central banks that have raised interest rates have quickly come to regret the decision.",

      "bodyText": "Here is our full story on the US jobs data, which smashed expectations. On that note, we are closing up for the day. Have a great weekend. We will be back on Monday. European stock markets have turned positive, led by Germany\u2019s Dax which is up 1.3%, while France\u2019s CAC is 0.45% ahead. The FTSE 100 index in London has gained more than 23 points to 6389.25, a 0.4% rise. On Wall Street, stocks opened slightly lower, but the Dow is now in positive territory, up 0.15% while the Nasdaq is flat. David Lamb, head of dealing at forex specialists FEXCO, says: The prospect of the Fed raising interest rates in December is now on a par with turkey on Thanksgiving - all but certain. Such clarity, and the bullish euphoria of such an expectation-smashing number, have propelled the Dollar to multi-month highs. With concern lingering about the strength of the global economy, such titanic performance from the US economy has turned the Greenback into a beacon of hope for investors. With a December rate hike now seemingly a done deal, huge inflows into the dollar should drive it even higher in the coming weeks.\u201d The 271,000 increase in jobs in October was the biggest since last December. US stock futures point to a slightly lower open on Wall street after the non-farm payrolls data smashed expectations and made a December rate hike from the Fed highly likely. Fed chair Janet Yellen hinted on Wednesday that the Fed could move at next month\u2019s meeting if data showed that the economy was strong enough to cope with higher interest rates. The dollar rallied on the jobs report, hitting a session high against the yen and rising 1.5% against the euro and 1% against sterling, to $1.5038. The pound is already under pressure because yesterday\u2019s inflation report from the Bank of England was more dovish than expected. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, agrees. The much bigger than expected 271,000 surge in non-farm payrolls in October confirms that the weakness in August and September was just a temporary blip and, given the circumstances, a December interest rate hike would now appear to be the most likely outcome. The rest of the employment report was encouraging too, with the unemployment rate falling to 5.0%, from 5.1%, the broader U6 measure of unemployment dropping to 9.8%, from 10.0% and the share of involuntary part-time workers dropping to a seven-year low. Unquestionably, that will be enough to convince Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer to vote for a rate hike at the next FOMC meeting in mid-December. Other voting members, particularly Fed Governor Lael Brainard, remain skeptical that the improvement in thelabour market will necessarily lead to higher wage growth and price inflation. But October\u2019s report also provides some evidence that the demise of the Phillips curve might have been exaggerated. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% m/m in October and the annual growth rate climbed to 2.5%, from 2.3%. 2.5% is still relatively modest, but it is nonetheless a six-year high. Regardless of the exact timing of the first rate hike, we still believe that the big story next year will be an unexpectedly strong pick-up in wage growth and price inflation, which will force the Fed into a much more aggressive policy tightening cycle than the Fed\u2019s projections currently suggest.\u201d \u201cWe would need to see a catastrophically bad November labour report for the Fed to sit on their hands again in December. We do not anticipate that\u201d says ING economist Rob Carnell says Following a disappointing run of labour reports, the October figure substantially surpassed the consensus view in nearly all respects. This 5.0% unemployment rate is well within the Fed\u2019s range for full employment, and this was, for once, nicely reflected in the wages component... The last time wages growth was this good was back in 2009, when it was on the way down during the financial crisis. And although this is by no means a runaway rate of growth for wage inflation, it does mark a clear improvement from recent trends, and could hint that the Fed is now behind the curve as far as policy setting goes. The next question is, if the Fed has left it too long before hiking, will forecasters have to ramp up their expectations for Fed tightening in 2016 and 2017, and start to question the view that future rises will be \u201ccautious\u201d? It is too early to say with any certainty. Next month\u2019s labour report, especially the wages series will shed more light on this. But we might see some substantially more aggressive pricing of Fed tightening next year, with consequent support for the USD and bond yields, especially at the front end.\u201d Tanweer Akram, senior economist at Voya Investment Management says: The strong job growth in October paves the way for the Fed to hike the fed funds target rate in December... Job growth occurred in a range of industries last month, including professional/business services, health care, retail trade, food services, and construction. Job growth has been strong for the past several years, while inflationary pressures remain subdued. In the past 12 months, job growth has averaged 230K per month. Average hourly earnings rose 2.5% year over year. The Fed is very likely to raise the fed funds target rate in December. The strong of job growth implies that there is no reason to keep the fed funds target rate at near zero level. However, the pace of tightening is likely to restrained and gradual going forward as inflationary pressure remain subdued. Long-term interest rates should still stay at historically low levels, after rising slightly with monetary tightening, due to still low short-term interest rates, subdued inflationary pressures, elevated size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, continued strong demand for safe assets, low long-term interest rates in overseas advanced economies and quantitative easing in the euro zone and Japan.\u201d Instant reaction on Twitter suggests that a Fed rate hike in December is now a done deal. We will get another non-farm payrolls report before the meeting on 15-16 December, though (on 4 December). The dollar is rallying, as the strong jobs data tip the odds in favour of a December rate hike. The September increase in jobs was revised down to 137,000 from 142,000 but the August number was revised higher to 153,000 from 136,000. Average hourly earnings arose 0.4% in October from the previous month and 2.5% year-on-year \u2013 also much stronger than expected. The unemployment rate has dipped to 5% from 5.1%. News flash: the American economy created 271,000 new jobs last month, versus expectations of 180,000. Non-farm payrolls are less than ten minutes away now. This is what we are expecting: A rise of 180,000 to 190,000 in the headline number for October (up from September and August, but a bit below the 200,000 plus monthly increases seen over the last couple of years) An unchanged unemployment rate at 5.1% A small pick-up in average hourly earnings growth to 2.3% from 2.2% year-on-year in September European stock markets are still in the red ahead of the US jobs data. The FTSE 100 index has also slipped, trading down 7.6 points at 6357.29, a 0.1% fall. Wall Street is expected to open lower after Walt Disney missed sales estimates. The non-farm payrolls data, out at 1.30pm UK time, are seen as one of the last few make-or-break data points before the Federal Reserve\u2019s next monetary policy meeting in December. Back to the UK, where Bank of England deputy governor Nemat Shafik has said that knowing precisely when interest rates will rise is not what really matters. (Britain\u2019s homeowners and businesses may disagree with that.) Shafik, a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also insisted that the central bank\u2019s system of \u201cforward guidance\u201d was not failing. Shafik, known as Minouche, defended the Bank\u2019s failure to give any clearer signal as to when the first rate hike in years will come, and rejected claims that it was failing to give promised advance notice. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. Isn\u2019t it better that the Bank of England give the public and the markets a sense of what our best collective judgment is of what is going to happen in the economy than to catch people by surprise? The consistent message that we have given is that future interest rate rises will be limited and gradual and I think everybody on the monetary policy committee signs up to that guidance and so far that has proven to be right. Even though I understand why people are concerned about the actual date of the first rate rise, what really matters to the economy is the path, and the path will be limited and gradual.\u201d China will lift a freeze on initial public offerings by the end of the year, removing one of its key measures of support for the stock market as equities recover from a $5 trillion rout, Bloomberg reports. Ronald Wan, Hong Kong-based chief executive officer told the news agency: There will be short-term damage to sentiment in the market. But the government has to proceed with market reform and the timing for IPOs will be better now than next year as the market seems to have some strength.\u201d You can read the full story here. Meanwhile, Hollywood star and Ballymena\u2019s most famous son Liam Neeson has called for help for the workers who are going to lose their jobs at the Michelin tyre plant in the North Antrim town, writes Henry McDonald. The actor expressed outrage today over the 860 redundancies at the factory which were announced earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic and the fallout will be felt throughout the whole community,\u201d Neeson said on Friday. The star of \u2018Schindler\u2019s List\u2019 and the \u2018Taken\u2019 series added: I am a great believer in the character and worth ethic of my people in the North. I\u2019ve always maintained that our wee corner of the globe is one of the world\u2019s best kept secrets, not least in its potential for developments in all areas of industry.\u201d Neeson urged the semi-dysfunctional power sharing executive in Belfast alongside Invest Northern Ireland to \u201cget to work now and promote the \u2018hell\u2019 out of the province. They have and always will have my full support.\u201d After the loss earlier this year of 800 jobs at the JTI Gallaghers tobacco plant in Ballymena coupled with Tuesday\u2019s Michelin\u2019s grim announcement the Co. Antrim town is going to need plenty of star-quality support in its quest to bring in new employment. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: While manufacturing contracted in the last quarter there are signs that some parts of industry were at least were mounting a comeback after a summer lull. Together with the sharp rebound in October\u2019s PMI, we may yet see some more positive data readings in the remainder of 2015 but the risks, reinforced in yesterday\u2019s Inflation report, from weaker activity in emerging markets are likely to present some headwinds for manufacturers into next year. Indeed, another disappointing set of trade figures for manufacturing show that these effects are already being felt with a significant fall in goods exports to China over the past three months.\u201d However, despite the latest improvement the ONS said trade was likely to make a negative contribution to Britain\u2019s economic output in the third quarter. And while manufacturing was strong in September, a weak start to the third quarter meant that over the quarter as a whole the sector disappointed with a 0.4% decline, and remained in recession. Ruth Miller, UK economist at Capital Economics, says: September\u2019s trade and industrial production figures provide further signs that the UK\u2019s economic recovery remained unbalanced in the third quarter... Looking ahead, the improvement in August\u2019s Markit/CIPS report on manufacturing in October has offered some hope that the sector may now have passed the worst. But it is still early days and we will need to see some more upbeat data before a renaissance in UK manufacturing can be declared. Accordingly, while we expect the overall economic recovery to maintain a solid pace, it is set to remain unbalanced in the near term at least. There is more good news from the ONS: the UK\u2019s trade deficit narrowed more than expected in September to \u00a39.4bn, from a revised \u00a310.8bn in August. Here in the UK, factory output has come in stronger than expected. Manufacturing rose 0.8% in September, the biggest monthly increase since April 2014. City economists had expected a rise of 0.4%. Overall industrial production, which also includes mining and utilities, fell 0.2% on the month after rising 0.9% in August. Over the third quarter, industrial output was up 0.2%, down from a 0.7% gain in the second. This was a tad below the 0.3% rise that the Office for National Statistics assumed in its initial estimate of third-quarter GDP growth. The ONS said the figures will have a negligible impact on the third-quarter GDP figures. The statistics office\u2019s first stab at the numbers showed economic growth slowing to 0.5% between July and September from 0.7% in the previous quarter. The dollar is rallying again boosted by comments from Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart yesterday. Seen by many as a swing voter at the US central bank, he left the door wide open to a rate rise at the December meeting. He said at a speech in Bern, Switzerland. Going into that [October] meeting, I felt a successful outcome would be expectations aligning with the view that \u2018liftoff\u2019 at our upcoming December meeting is a possibility, but not a certainty. I am satisfied that was accomplished.\u201d He reckons the case for what will be the first rate hike in about a decade will continue to strengthen before the Fed\u2019s December meeting. At this juncture, it\u2019s my assessment that the US economy is likely in an above-potential growth phase, with labor markets continuing to improve, and with an underlying inflationary trend that, if not rapidly moving toward the [Fed\u2019s] objective, is at least not moving away from that objective. I think the case for liftoff will continue to firm up.\u201d The pace of rate hikes after that \u201cwill most appropriately be very gradual.\u201d ... and the dollar could push the euro below $1.08 for the first time since April if we get a strong US jobs report at lunchtime, which would tip the odds in a favour of a Fed rate hike next month. It is currently down 0.1% at $1.0870. The FTSE 100 index has started Friday flat. It\u2019s up just 3.6 points at 6368.53 ahead of industrial output and trade figures at 9.30am. Eurozone indices have slipped into the red following weak German industrial production data. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.2% and France\u2019s CAC has lost 0.55%, prompted by a widening French trade deficit. The pound has hit a one-month low of $1.5169 against the dollar, down 0.3% on the day. Talk Talk has released on update on last month\u2019s Cyber attack. Sean Farrell writes: Almost 157,000 TalkTalk customers had their personal details hacked in last month\u2019s cyber-attack on the telecoms company. Talk Talk said the total number of customers affected by the attack two weeks ago was 156,959, including 15,656 whose bank account numbers and sort codes were hacked. The total is 4% of TalkTalk\u2019s 4 million customers and is a small fraction of the number feared when news of the attack broke. The number of customers whose bank details were stolen is lower than an estimate of less than 21,000 released a week ago. The company said 28,000 credit and debit card numbers, with some digits obscured, stolen by the hackers cannot be used for payment and customers cannot be identified from the data. Read the full story here. A day after releasing better-than-expected third-quarter results and upgrading its annual forecasts, British drugmaker AstraZeneca has unveiled a sizeable acquisition. It has agreed to buy Californian biotech ZS Pharma for $2.7bn (\u00a31.8bn), beating off competition from Swiss firm Actelion. ZS Pharma is working on novel treatments for hyperkalaemia, a serious condition of elevated potassium in the bloodstream, which is typically associated with chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure. Peak sales of the firm\u2019s ZS-9 potassium-binding compound, which is under review by US regulators, are forecast to top $1bn. It is the latest deal in a bumper year for mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical world. New York-based pharma giant Pfizer is courting Allergan and is reportedly hoping to get a deal done by Thanksgiving. A deal would unite the US makers of Viagra and Botox and create a drugs giant worth more than $300bn. Pfizer has turned its attention to Allergan after being rebuffed by the UK\u2019s GlaxoSmithKline this year and its spectacular failure to acquire AstraZeneca for \u00a370bn last year. It wants to shift its tax base abroad to lower its tax bill. Allergan is domiciled in Dublin and its tax rate is far below Pfizer\u2019s in the US. ...and you can watch the John Lewis Christmas ads from the last few years here, including Monty the Penguin (2014), the Bear &amp; the Hare (2013), the Journey (2012) and The Long Wait (2011). You can watch the John Lewis Christmas ad here. After two years of successful ads featuring cuddly animals \u2013 a bear and hare then a penguin \u2013 this year the retailer is tugging at the heartstrings with the story of a young girl, Lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope. The determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally enables them to make contact, writes Sarah Butler. At 8am, the latest John Lewis Christmas ad will go live. Sarah Butler writes: A lonely old man living in a crater on the moon is the unlikely focus of John Lewis\u2019s Christmas advert this year, as the department store puts a charitable spin on its latest multi-million pound campaign. Amid increasing hype around John Lewis\u2019s seasonal ad, which has come to mark the beginning of the Christmas shopping season for many, the department store will aim to use its profile to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for Age UK. It will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might otherwise be alone over the holiday. German industrial output posted its biggest drop in more than a year in September, data from the Economy Ministry showed this morning. Factories produced 1.1% fewer goods than in the previous month. This comes after German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in September due to cooling demand from overseas, suggesting Europe\u2019s biggest economy is losing steam. The ministry said: After a good development in the first half, German industry is currently experiencing a light tailwind from the world economy, in particular due to a slowdown in some large emerging markets.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the excitement of Super Thursday \u2013 where the Bank of England signalled that interest rates are likely to remain on hold at their record low of 0.5% until well into next year \u2013 the attention shifts to the US today. Non-farm payrolls, the monthly employment report, are out at 1.30pm UK time. Economists are expecting a better outturn than in September, when only 142,000 new jobs were created, and August, which was revised lower to 136,000. October could see an increase of 180,000 to 190,000 jobs, a touch below the 200,000 plus monthly increases seen over the last couple of years. The unemployment rate is forecast to remain unchanged at 5.1%. This would still mark a significant slowdown on the jobs growth seen in 2014, where we saw a gain of over 3.1m jobs. So far this year, the total number of jobs added in the US economy comes to 1.78m, notes Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. It will be interesting to see whether average hourly earnings growth picked up from the rate of 2.2% year-on-year recorded in September. Markets are looking for clues on whether the Federal Reserve will hike rates next month. It remains an \u201cincredibly close call,\u201d Hewson says. A December interest rate increase is still on the table, Fed chair Janet Yellen said on Wednesday during testimony before the House financial services committee. In the UK, we are getting manufacturing and industrial production figures for September, alongside trade data, at 9.30am.",

But October\u2019s report also provides some evidence that the demise of the Phillips curve might have been exaggerated. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% m/m in October and the annual growth rate climbed to 2.5%, from 2.3%. 2.5% is still relatively modest, but it is nonetheless a six-year high.</p> <p>Regardless of the exact timing of the first rate hike, we still believe that the big story next year will be an unexpectedly strong pick-up in wage growth and price inflation, which will force the Fed into a much more aggressive policy tightening cycle than the Fed\u2019s projections currently suggest.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-11-06T14:01:44.622Z\">at 2.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-563cb08fe4b0bbf4cf2cd1ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-06T13:54:59.316Z\">1.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cWe would need to see a catastrophically bad November labour report for the Fed to sit on their hands again in December.

The last time wages growth was this good was back in 2009, when it was on the way down during the financial crisis. And although this is by no means a runaway rate of growth for wage inflation, it does mark a clear improvement from recent trends, and could hint that the Fed is now behind the curve as far as policy setting goes.</p> <p>The next question is, if the Fed has left it too long before hiking, will forecasters have to ramp up their expectations for Fed tightening in 2016 and 2017, and start to question the view that future rises will be \u201ccautious\u201d? It is too early to say with any certainty. Next month\u2019s labour report, especially the wages series will shed more light on this.

      "bodyText": "The owner of British Airways has announced that the boss of no-frills Spanish carrier Vueling will replace the outgoing chairman Keith Williams. Williams, who joined BA in 1998, will be replaced as executive chairman by Alex Cruz in April. International Airlines Group, formed through the \u00a35bn merger of British Airways and Spain\u2019s Iberia in 2011, also owns Vueling. The change is part of a broader executive reshuffle that will also see chief financial officer Nick Swift hand over to Steve Gunning, the chief executive of IAG\u2019s cargo operation. IAG, led by chief executive Willie Walsh, announced the leadership change alongside multiple upgrades to its five-year financial outlook. Its return on invested capital target was raised from 12% to 15% and its operating profit is expected to hit an average of \u20ac5.6bn (\u00a34bn) \u2013 up from \u20ac5bn \u2013 with profit poised to grow by 12% a year. It expects an operating profit margin of between 12% and 15%, compared with its previous target of between 10% to 14%. IAG previously announced that capital expenditure could reach \u20ac3bn per year but has since said it would not exceed \u20ac2.5bn. IAG also said synergies from the merger that created the group will reach \u20ac856m, more than double the prediction of \u20ac400m made when BA and Iberia revealed their plans in 2010. The upgrades come a week after IAG reported an \u00a3850m quarterly profit and announced a debut dividend. Analysts said IAG, which also includes Aer Lingus since a takeover was cleared in July, could steal a march on major European rivals such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa. \u201cWe expect IAG to further decouple from structurally weaker peers,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Mark Irvine-Fortescue. Shares in IAG were up 3% to 598p by noon on Friday.",

      "bodyText": "ArcelorMittal blamed cheap Chinese imports for depressing the price of steel as the world\u2019s biggest steelmaker scrapped its annual dividend after losing $1.3bn (\u00a3860m) in the first nine months of 2015. The company blamed unsustainably low export prices from China and customers delaying purchases for the net loss, which was 10 times bigger than the $131m loss recorded a year earlier. Sales fell by $11bn to $49.6bn, underlining the crisis in the steel industry. Conditions deteriorated rapidly in the third quarter, when ArcelorMittal\u2019s net loss was $711m \u2013 more than half the total for the year. ArcelorMittal, based in Luxembourg, wrote down the value of its steel stocks by $500m to reflect rapid falls in prices. Aditya Mittal, the company\u2019s finance director, said. \u201cThis is essentially the result of very low export prices out of China that are impacting prices worldwide.\u201d European steelmakers are struggling to cope with falling prices, cheap imports and weakened demand as the economy slows in China, the biggest user and producer of the metal. British companies have partly blamed dumping of cheap steel by China for a series of plant closures that has left one in six UK steelworkers facing redundancy. Tata Steel slashed the value of its UK business by \u00a3862m on Thursday after announcing plans last month to cut 1,200 jobs. The writedown effectively made Tata\u2019s UK operation worthless for accounting purposes. ArcelorMittal, which makes car parts in the Midlands and has operations around the world, reduced its annual forecast for earnings before interest, tax, and other items to as low as $5.2bn from a target of $6bn to $7bn. It will suspend its annual dividend to save $360m and reduce investment spending and operating costs. Before an emergency meeting of European Union ministers scheduled for Monday to discuss the steel crisis, ArcelorMittal said politicians needed to move more quickly to stop the dumping of cheap Chinese steel in Europe. Lakshmi Mittal, ArcelorMittal\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said: \u201cWhile we are confident our actions are the right ones, there are also important issues for governments to address, specifically relating to unfair trade. We are encouraged by various examples of trade action being initiated in response to dumping, but the process needs to be faster in order to be fully effective.\u201d Sajid Javid, the business secretary, will represent Britain at the steel summit in Brussels, after receiving criticism for a slow response to the crisis. The UK government was also accused of failing to complain about cheap Chinese steel exports when China\u2019s premier, Xi Jinping, visited the UK last month. ArcelorMittal said imports in Europe, including from China and the Commonwealth of Independent States, were at a record high and were still rising, meaning European steelmakers would struggle to benefit from a recovery in demand as pricing pressure continued next year. \u201cThis is not an economic crisis, it is not a volume crisis, it is an import crisis,\u201d Aditya Mittal said. \u201cOur core markets of Europe and Nafta [North American free trade agreeement] are still growing.\u201d",

Icap, led by the Tory donor Michael Spencer, said it was considering the sale of its global broking business to Tullett in exchange for shares. The division includes voice and electronic broking in areas including commodities, foreign exchange, equities and emerging markets. Tullett would issue new stock as part of a structure that would leave Icap holding a minority stake in the enlarged firm. The discussions come amid tough conditions for interdealer brokers, who act as middlemen for the trading of securities between investment banks. Tullett Prebon blamed tighter regulation, low interest rates and subdued market volumes for its own woes as it announced plans to cut 5% of broking jobs amid cost cuts. There were 1,573 brokers at the company at the end of 2014, according to the firm\u2019s annual report, suggesting that nearly 80 people are to lose their jobs. Although the firm enjoyed a 13% rise in revenue to \u00a3671m between January and October, it warned that an anticipated decline in second-half revenue meant full-year underlying operating profit would now be 1.5% points lower than expected.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer predicts a surge in shopping via phones and tablets this Christmas, as it launches its festive advertising campaign. In contrast to John Lewis\u2019s emotional yuletide TV ad launched on Friday morning, M&amp;S features dancers, models with bobble hats, gift ribbons and a giant handbag, as well as sparkly puddings and a penguin cake. The main M&amp;S ad, which is celebrity-free for the second year in a row, has a modern feel with a besuited female drummer and a stark black and silver set. The retailer said it would devote more than a quarter of its advertising spend to digital channels this Christmas. Marks &amp; Spencer will release its glitzy ads to its Sparks loyalty scheme members on Friday afternoon before a 5pm launch on social media, where M&amp;S says it has 4.5 million followers . It predicted sales via mobile devices could rise by more than 50% this season. The ad will launch on TV on Sunday during Downton Abbey. Sparks, which has 2 million members after adding 200,000 in the past three days, will play an important role in the campaign with special events in-store such as wine tasting. Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s executive director of marketing, said: \u201cWe think 2015 is going to be the biggest online Christmas ever in the UK ... first and foremost for inspiration and browsing, which will be at an all-time peak on smartphones and shopping as well.We are seeing amazing growth in mobile engagement ... from being about search related it is really now about purchasing as well.\u201d The growing popularity of the click and collect system meant people were likely to leave their shopping later than ever, Bousquet-Chavanne said, but it would be a better Christmas for retailers than last year. \u201cCustomers are clearly feeling better than last year according to a variety of consumer confidence indexes we think confidence is up 4%. They are feeling more festive and joyous and there is greater pent up anticipation,\u201d he added. M&amp;S would be spending slightly more than last year on the creation and distribution of its ad, but more than 25% would be spent on digital channels compared with about 20% last year. Bousquet-Chavanne said M&amp;S had tried to create \u201cmini-moments\u201d that would build up to Christmas as it attempted to stay in tune with the way most people manage their festive plans. \u201cIt is less feature film and more on-trend box set,\u201d he said. Echoing the M&amp;S chief Marc Bolland\u2019s expectation that Christmas would be \u201cspiky\u201d this year, Bousquet-Chavanne said predicting shopping patterns was tricky because of the rise of the Black Friday discount day in the UK, which takes place on 27 November this year. However, he suggested there would be three or four days when online visitors would surpass 200 million \u2013 including Black Friday and the following Monday, known as Cyber Monday, as it previously marked the biggest online shopping day of the year.",

Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed manufacturing output increased by 0.8% between August and September \u2013 the biggest monthly jump in more than a year. Meanwhile, higher exports and falling imports meant the UK\u2019s trade deficit more than halved in September \u2013 falling from \u00a33bn to \u00a31.4bn.

Manufacturing output was down 0.4% on the second quarter, leaving the sector in technical recession, while the deficit in goods and services widened from \u00a35.1bn to \u00a38.5bn. Despite the September increase in factory output, manufacturing production remains more than 6% below the peak it reached in 2008, before the economy\u2019s descent into its most severe postwar recession. Industrial production \u2013 comprising manufacturing, mining and quarrying, North Sea output and energy supply \u2013 increased by 0.2% in the third quarter, compared with the 0.3% the ONS had pencilled in when estimating the economy\u2019s 0.5% growth rate for the third quarter. The ONS said a near 5% drop in mining and quarrying meant industrial production fell by 0.2% in September, and in the third quarter it was more than 9% down on its pre-recession high. Over the three months to September, there was evidence of a strong pound and a weakening in global demand making life difficult for British companies to sell abroad. Exports declined by 6%, widening the deficit in goods by almost \u00a36bn to just over \u00a332bn.",

Britain\u2019s second biggest drugs company followed Thursday\u2019s upbeat annual results by announcing a $90 a share deal to snap up ZS Pharma\u2019s technology to develop treatments for hyperkalemia, or high potassium levels. The condition can result in chronic kidney disease or chronic heart failure. ZS Pharma\u2019s ZS-9 treatment is under review by the US Food and Drug Administration and could produce sales of more than $1bn a year if approved, AstraZeneca said.

Actelion of Switzerland said in September it had started talks with ZS Pharma, based in San Mateo, California, that could have led to a bid.

Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cHyperkalemia can be a life-threatening condition for patients with chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure. However, the risk is underappreciated and prevalence is increasing. \u201cThis acquisition complements our strategic focus on cardiovascular and metabolic disease by adding a potential best in class treatment to our portfolio of innovative medicines.\u201d The acquisition is part of a deal frenzy sweeping the pharmaceutical sector as companies look to cut costs and buy new treatments to replace ageing drugs whose patents are expiring. AstraZeneca has made a number of acquisitions to gain specific products and was the subject of a failed \u00a370bn takeover approach by the US company Pfizer last year. Pfizer is in talks with Allergan, the maker of Botox, to form the world\u2019s biggest healthcare business.

      "bodyText": "Almost 157,000 TalkTalk customers had their personal details hacked in last month\u2019s cyber-attack on the telecoms company. Talk Talk said the total number of customers affected by the attack two weeks ago was 156,959, including 15,656 whose bank account numbers and sort codes were hacked. The total is 4% of TalkTalk\u2019s 4 million customers and is a small fraction of the number feared when news of the attack broke. The number of customers whose bank details were stolen is lower than an estimate of less than 21,000 released a week ago. The company said 28,000 credit and debit card numbers, with some digits obscured, stolen by the hackers cannot be used for payment and customers cannot be identified from the data. TalkTalk said it had worked to establish how much personal data had been stolen in the hacking attack on 21 October and that it was now able to publish definite numbers. It advised customers to be on guard against scam emails and phone calls and said the stolen information on its own could not lead to financial loss. When the cyber-attack was revealed, TalkTalk said it did not know how many customers were affected, raising concerns that hundreds of thousands of customers could be at risk. The company was criticised for its lack of information and for failing to to take precautions after being hacked twice before this year. TalkTalk said: \u201cOur ongoing forensic analysis of the site confirms that the scale of the attack was much more limited than initially suspected. It was a difficult decision to notify all our customers of the risk before we could establish the real extent of any data loss. We believe we had a responsibility to warn customers ahead of having the clarity we are finally able to give today.\u201d Two teenage boys have been arrested and bailed in connection with the cyber-attack \u2013 a 16-year-old from west London and a 15-year-old from County Antrim, Northern Ireland. TalkTalk said the company and the Metropolitan police were continuing their investigations. TalkTalk said it would not contact customers about the hacking incident and ask for bank details or other personal or financial information.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Overnight, thousands of pages of text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have been released, ending months of secrecy. As experts around the world begin the task of poring over the detail, here are four key issues to watch. Environment The language in this chapter of the TPP covers objectives ranging from protecting the environment from ship pollution, protecting the ozone layer, dealing with \u201cinvasive alien species\u201d and implementing voluntary mechanisms to enhance environmental performance. But green groups and trade experts including Matthew Rimmer, professor of intellectual property and innovation at the Queensland University of Technology, have been surprised to learn the chapter doesn\u2019t actually use the words climate change. \u201cInstead [of climate change], there is some weak language on the transition to a low emissions economy,\u201d Rimmer says. The \u201clow emissions\u201d language in the text is not so much weak as artfully non-specific. It says parties to the TPP recognise \u201ceach party\u2019s actions to transition to a low emissions economy should reflect domestic circumstances and capabilities\u201d. It presages cooperation between the signatories on energy efficiency, renewable energy investment, sustainable urban infrastructure development, addressing deforestation and forest degradation, conducting emissions monitoring, developing market and non-market mechanisms, and pursuing low-emissions, resilient development (whatever that might mean). It also says the parties shall, \u201cas appropriate\u201d, engage in cooperative and capacity-building activities related to transitioning to a low emissions economy. On the omission of the words \u201cclimate change\u201d from the TPP, the Australian trade minister, Andrew Robb, says: \u201cWell, this is not a climate change policy. It\u2019s not an agreement to do with climate change, it\u2019s a trade agreement.\u201d Environmental group Greenpeace says the chapter as a whole is very disappointing. \u201cThere are no new enforcement mechanisms to ensure that countries uphold their own environmental standards, and the mechanisms to enhance environmental performance are only voluntary,\u201d said Emma Gibson, head of program for Greenpeace Australia Pacific. Labour rights This chapter draws on the declaration of the International Labour Organisation to articulate labour standards and regulations within signatory countries. It says parties to the TPP should engage in cooperative activity to \u201cenhance opportunities to improve labour standards and to further advance common commitments regarding labour matters, including workers\u2019 wellbeing and quality of life and the principles and rights stated in the ILO declaration\u201d. It also notes \u201ceach party recognises the goal of eliminating all forms of forced or compulsory labour, including forced or compulsory child labour\u201d. In Australia, trade unions will be paying close attention to the labour rights chapter, particularly in the wake of controversy over comparable provisions in the recent bilateral Australia/China free trade agreement. Looking globally, Rimmer says there will be a lot of discussion as to whether the TPP\u2019s labour rights enforcement regime will be effective and workable. The enforcement provision says this: \u201cNo party shall fail to effectively enforce its labour laws through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in a manner affecting trade or investment between the parties after the date of entry into force of this agreement.\u201d Rimmer predicts the global labour movement will be unconvinced by the wording. \u201cThere will remain much disquiet about the inclusion of Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia in the agreement. There will continue to be concerns about labour rights, freedom of association, and human trafficking,\u201d he says. Intellectual property Any non-lawyerly person contemplating reading the TPP\u2019s intellectual property chapter before they\u2019ve downed a stiff whiskey or some other mind clearing substance is a very brave soul indeed. But read we must, because the IP chapter has been one of the biggest fight clubs of the TPP. In summary, the chapter delivers a stronger regime in copyright protection, trademark and patent law, and sets out rules for \u201cbiologics\u201d \u2013 pharmaceuticals, in layperson\u2019s terms. The Australian trade minister Andrew Robb says 40 straight hours of negotiation were required at the final meeting to settle the treatment of biologics to Canberra\u2019s satisfaction. The US wanted at least eight years of data exclusivity for biologics, when the Australian standard is five years. The US demand would have meant Australians waiting longer before cheaper versions of pharmaceuticals became available. \u201cWe haven\u2019t moved one iota on any of that health area,\u201d Robb says. But Patricia Ranald, coordinator of the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network says the TPP text isn\u2019t open and shut. It opens up the prospect of a review, and further consultations. \u201cFive years is a minimum standard but the text also refers to eight years and to \u2018other measures\u2019 which would \u2018deliver a comparable market outcome,\u2019 and to a future review. It is not clear how this will be applied in Australia,\u201d Ranald says. But trade consultant Alan Oxley plays down the risk. \u201cThat\u2019s called a negotiation, I really don\u2019t think that is significant. Robb had a brief and he held it.\u201d Rimmer also points to another area of potential controversy in the IP chapter: criminal procedures and penalties in respect of disclosure of trade secrets, computer crimes and espionage. \u201cSuch provisions could have a significant impact upon journalists, whistleblowers, and civil society,\u201d he says. Investment The TPP aims to free up investment between signatory countries. But the controversy in this chapter will be focussed squarely on the inclusion of an investor state dispute settlement clause. Trade agreements with ISDS clauses are increasingly controversial both in Australia and around the world. These clauses allow foreign investors to sue governments over policies that harm their interests. On Friday, the shadow trade minister Penny Wong said Robb should have \u201crejected the inclusion of ISDS provisions in the TPP\u201d. Greens leader Richard Di Natale said it was \u201cremarkable that what we are prepared to do is to see big foreign multinational corporations given the power to sue governments for protecting people\u2019s health and the environment\u201d. But trade consultant Oxley is unmoved by the backlash. He says the current opposition to ISDS clauses is merely a new focal point for anti-trade liberalisation activists. \u201cBusiness supports ISDS clauses \u2013 no-one in Australian business thinks these are a bad idea. The onerousness of them is significantly misrepresented.\u201d But Ranald cites an often quoted case \u2013 the Philip Morris case \u2013 as a reason ISDS clauses should be a no go zone. The tobacco firm is taking legal action against Australia\u2019s plain packaging laws. \u201cThe general \u2018safeguards\u2019 in the TPP text are qualified, and similar to those in other recent agreements which have not prevented cases against health and environmental laws,\u201d she says. The TPP text recognises it is legitimate to protect \u201cpublic welfare objectives\u201d and this activity does not constitute \u201cindirect expropriations, except in rare circumstances\u201d. Robb has pointed to these exclusions as significant, preventing potential abuse of the ISDS process. Rimmer points out the general exceptions chapter in the TPP text provides the opportunity for countries to elect to protect tobacco from the investment regime for tobacco control measures. There\u2019s a \u201cbut\u201d, though. \u201cHowever, this is not a complete carve-out for tobacco control measures. Moreover, the agreement does not necessarily provide protection for tobacco control measures from attack under other regimes.\u201d",

Our intention was never to upset anyone,\u201d it says. \u201cAs the fresh food people we know how passionate our customers are about fresh food. We share their passion and want everyone to eat healthily whether they grow their own or choose healthy foods from our supermarkets.\u201d Most comments on the page supported Woolworths deleting the advertisement. Bridges, the head of a fitness empire launched after she appeared as a trainer on the Biggest Loser TV show, addressed the controversy in an Instagram post. \u201cOur intention with our ads for Delicious Nutritious were to poke fun at myself and what many see as \u2018my (completely fictional) perfect life\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was never any intention to offend and for this we sincerely apologise.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s stake in Eurostar was sold for \u00a3757m even though the government believed its value would rise, because ministers wanted to offload the state\u2019s share in the cross-Channel train service before the general election, a report has concluded. The report by the National Audit Office into the sale, published on Friday, found that taxpayers had invested four times more in Eurostar, approximately \u00a33bn, than the sum recouped from the sale in March. Dividend payments to the government over the next 10 years were forecast to exceed \u00a3700m, almost matching the amount paid for Britain\u2019s 40% Eurostar stake and preference share. The NAO said it regarded the sale process as effective and \u201cvalue for money\u201d, but the chair of the public accounts committee accused ministers of pursuing short-term cash rather than long-term value. The government put Britain\u2019s stake in Eurostar, which it had owned jointly with the French and Belgian governments since services began in 1994, up for sale last autumn. George Osborne described the eventual sale as a \u201cfantastic deal for UK taxpayers that exceeds expectations\u201d. But the NAO report showed that Eurostar\u2019s profits were forecast to increase significantly from 2016, when new, higher-capacity trains will be brought into service. Although the government thought higher profits could increase the price tag, it decided to sell to avoid uncertainty and risks. However, the timing was \u201cprimarily driven by the desire to sell prior to the 2015 general election\u201d, said the NAO. Amyas Morse, the auditor general of the NAO, said: \u201cThe government prepared well for the sale of Eurostar and the sale process was run effectively. I regard the sale as value for money.\u201d But he said there were lessons for the government as it starts to sell off \u00a362bn of national assets, including the need for a detailed business case and to get objective and robust valuations from advisers. The NAO said paid consultants were shown other valuations before carrying out supposedly independent assessments of Eurostar. A Treasury spokesperson said the NAO had confirmed that the sale delivered a good deal for British taxpayers with a process that was well run and effective. \u201cGetting the best value for money for the taxpayer and tackling our country\u2019s debts so our country lives within its means are key parts of our long-term plan, and as this report shows, the government is delivering on these objectives,\u201d they said. Meg Hillier, the Labour MP and chair of the public accounts committee, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s focus in selling its stake in Eurostar appears to have been on short-term cash rather than long-term value for taxpayers. Once sold, the family silver can\u2019t be bought back.\u201d Labour said the NAO report showed the public purse had \u201csuffered a considerable net loss\u201d. Lilian Greenwood, the shadow transport secretary, said it was unacceptable the decision to sell was driven by the election and that taxpayers would never recoup their \u00a33bn investment. \u201cJust like with East Coast, the privatisation of a successful publicly owned rail operator was prioritised. We need a new approach to the railways which puts passengers first, and leaves the Tories\u2019 ideological opposition to public ownership behind,\u201d she said. Mick Cash, the general secretary of the RMT said: \u201cHowever you dress it up, the fire sale of the UK\u2019s Eurostar stake before the election has cost the taxpayer billions in wasted investment and lost future profits.\u201d The public accounts committee will hold a hearing into the sale later this month.",
