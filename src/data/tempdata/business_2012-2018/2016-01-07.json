      "bodyText": "And finally, here are a few photos from Wall Street as traders digest the news that this has been the worst start to a new year in the Dow\u2019s history. Reuters\u2019 Brendan Mcdermid has really captured the mood: And that\u2019s a good time to wrap up. My colleagues in Asia will be at their desks in a couple of hours, ready to track the latest twists in this saga. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning too. Thanks, and goodnight. GW Confirmation that this has been a historically bad start to the year: The stock market turmoil makes the front page of Friday\u2019s Financial Times, and City AM: Investors on both sides of the Atlantic will head to bed tonight, wondering what drama will occur in China while they sleep. Bill Gross, the bond-trading expert (ex-Pimco, now Janus Capital), predicts another day of losses on the Shanghai market: Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Gross pointed to exchange traded funds (securities which track stock market indices): \u201cBased upon the ETF in the United States, China is predicted to be down 5 percent or 6 percent\u2026But China is an artificial market. All global markets are artificially based. And to the extent that we have a catharsis, I think, depends upon central banks basically giving up in terms of what they do. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d The VIX \u2018fear index\u2019, which tracks volatility in the market, is up by a fifth today! That shows US investors are pretty worried right now. The Canadian stock market has also suffered a dose of the China blues. Toronto is now 20% below its record high in September 2014, dragged down by weakening natural resource stocks as emerging markets have hit trouble. Hello again. Wall Street has just closed for the night, and like Europe, the losses are pretty dramatic. The S&amp;P 500 - the broader measure of American stocks - shed over 2.3% by the end of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average suffered a similar decline, shedding 393 points to 16514. And the tech-focused Nasdaq is down 3%. That puts the Nasdaq in correction territory, ie: more than 10% below its recent high. CNBC reckons this is the worst start to the year for the Dow, ever! Finally, Europe\u2019s stock markets have closed after a volatile day\u2019s trading dominated by China. Despite a late recovery, the FTSE 100 has finished the day down 119 points, or 1.96%, at 5954. That\u2019s a three-week low, which wipes around \u00a330bn off the blue-chip index. Mining giants were the biggest casualties -- Anglo American lost 11% to a new record low, Glencore shed 8% and Antofagasta lost 5%. They tumbled at the start of trading, after London traders heard that the Chinese stock market had been suspended after 30 minutes, and remained in the red all day. The London stock market has now suffered its second-worst start to a new year since 1988 (only beaten by the end of the dot-com boom). Other European markets also posted heavy losses, although Beijing\u2019s ditching of its stock market circuit breaker did bring some relief. The German DAX was the worst performer, as manufacturing firms were hit by fears that the global economy might be dragged down by China (bad for exports!). Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says that the UK chancellor added to the gloom with a warning about the global economy. Suspension of trading in Chinese stocks \u2013 the second time in a week - is once again being eyed as the key driver behind the downside pressures after more Yuan devaluation hit local equities hard, although overtures from George Osborne that we should be bracing ourselves for interest rate hikes here in the UK are adding an extra layer of gloom to the equation. In London, mining stocks are once again suffering the most with what looks like an imminent hard landing for the economy in China \u2013 and one that arguably can\u2019t be avoided with government intervention \u2013 whilst Aberdeen Asset Management (-7.7%) is also struggling against the fact assets under management will we suffering in the wake of this Chinese downturn. And Wall Street remains in the red too -- the Dow is down 200 points, or 1.1%, right now. That\u2019s a good moment to pause the blog, but I\u2019ll update later with the Wall Street close (or if anything dramatic happens) The Economist have a corker of a story - Saudi Arabia is considering floating its state oil firm, Aramco. That\u2019s according to the kingdom\u2019s deputy crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, who also spoke about his plans to shake up its economy. A \u201cThatcherite revolution\u201d, no less. A decision will be taken on whether to sell a slice of the company within months, and Prince Muhammad is keen, saying: \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco.\u201d If that happens, Aramco could become the world\u2019s largest listed company in the world - potentially worth trillions of dollars. Prince Muhammad also argued that Saudi\u2019s decision to break of diplomatic relations with Iran was designed to prevent tensions between the two countries escalating, and even touched on issues of human rights and gender equality (although progress remains glacial). Here\u2019s the full transcript. Away from the turmoil in the global economy, there is bad news for workers at a long-standing Scottish knitwear company. The firm, Hawick Knitwear, has gone into administration with the loss of more than 120 jobs. Administrators are urging anyone interested in taking on the company to get in touch. Press Association has more details: Hawick Knitwear has a manufacturing heritage dating back to 1874 and administrators say they hope a buyer can be found. The company\u2019s finances have suffered from increasing production costs and reducing margins, while attempts to secure new investment have been unsuccessful. Recent mild winters have also led to a reduced demand for heavier winter garments. The firm employed 179 staff, of whom 123 have been made redundant. Local MSP John Lamont, who represents the area in the Scottish Assembly,called it \u201cdevastating news\u201d. \u201cIt is a massive shock to lose such a well-respected and big name as Hawick Knitwear.\u201d Spreadex\u2019s Connor Campbell confirms that Beijing\u2019s u-turn has brought some relief to the City. However, we don\u2019t yet know how investors in China will react.... Whilst still pretty dire, the global indices appear to have been (briefly) calmed this afternoon by news that China will be suspending the stock market circuit breaker rule that has wreaked such havoc this week. It seems that investors, for now at least, are taking the news as a positive, the move ostensibly preventing the panic-pause-more panic pattern that appeared in the Chinese markets on Monday and Thursday from repeating itself. That\u2019s the theory, at least; we\u2019ll just have to see how it works in practice tomorrow morning, as whilst the exacerbating nature of the circuit breaker rule may have been removed, the fear-inspiring issues currently scaring the bejesus out of investors remain unsolved. Four members of the FTSE 100 have now scrambled into positive territory, as the London market recovers some of its earlier losses: (hat-tip to the Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham) In another surprise twist, Denmark\u2019s central bank just raised interest rates - at least for commercial banks. The move means that Danish commercial banks will only face a negative rate of -0.65% on money left at the central bank, up from -0.75%. It won\u2019t affect individuals; the benchmark interest rate is still virtually zero (0.05%). China\u2019s decision to suspend its ill-fated circuit breaker system has been welcomed by the markets. In London, the FTSE 100 is clawing back some losses. It\u2019s now down \u201cjust\u201d 121 points, or 2%, at 5957. That still wipes out \u00a330bn of value, and puts the FTSE 100 at a three-week low. Wall Street is also relieved -- the Dow is now down 1.2%. Investors had been worried that the Chinese market might suffer another truncated session overnight, if investors raced to sell shares before the index hit the daily limit-down point. More reaction: Here\u2019s a reminder of how the Chinese circuit breaker kicked into action today, triggering the shortest trading session ever (just 29 minutes!) Breaking news from China... the stock market regulator has apparently announced that it WILL suspend its stock market breaker rule. A sensible decision, as the rule has been tested and found wanting this week. Ouch. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed almost 300 points, or 1.7%. Every share is in the red: Hold onto your tin hats, folks. The New York opening bell is ringing, and shares are tumbling sharply. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 1.25%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped over 2%. It will take a few minutes for Wall Street to calm down. But the news that the Chinese stock market was suspended after just 30 minutes earlier today is clearly alarming investors. Commodity prices are hitting new five-year lows, thanks to economic growth fears and the stronger dollar. Palladium is down 5% at $482 per ounce, its lowest level since August 2010. Zinc has hit a six-year low, and copper is also down. Could Beijing authorities ditch their circuit-breaker rule, following this week\u2019s turmoil? Something certainly needs to be done. We saw today that the prospect of an immediate daily suspension if the market drops too much actually triggered a swift selloff (as investors dashed to get out while they can). The 5% trigger was hit after just 14 minute, followed by the 7% time-out once trading resumed. That\u2019s not a recipe for calm, rational trading. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is currently down 2.5%, or 152 points -- on track to hit a three-week low. If it falls much further, it would threaten the lows of last August, the last time China triggered a stock market rout: The US stock market is on track to hit a new three-month low, when trading begins in 40 minutes time: The China crisis is partly caused by Beijing\u2019s policy of pegging its currency against the US dollar, argues economist Sean Richards. A deeper analysis of the Chinese situation shows us that its own financial instabilities have been exacerbated by the strong US Dollar. This has been made worse by its decision to set its exchange-rate against it. Thus rather than drifting lower like virtually everyone else instead the pressure builds up, which it has tried to resist, but even with its sizeable currency reserves it has to give way every now and then. This then adds to the pressure as everybody concentrates on the decline in the reserves rather than the large amount left. Also I suspect that those in the \u201cknow\u201d have been trying to get out of the Yuan before it falls further which only makes things worse. Got it in one... China\u2019s international competitors will fear that Beijing is triggering a currency war, by allowing the yuan to hit a five-year low against the US dollar today. Andy Yu, senior economist at MNI Indicators, says other emerging market currencies will probably also weaken in response (reminder, they\u2019ve already weakened this year). \u201cA weaker yuan is a concern for emerging markets that compete directly with China in exports. The immediate upshot is that currencies in countries including South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and Taiwan will continue to adjust downwards in response to yuan moves. That would push up debt repayments for countries who have borrowed in US dollars. But encouragingly, Yu reckons emerging markets have the firepower to ride out the crisis: On current evidence the risk of a full blown emerging markets crisis looks less likely with emerging economies having built up larger foreign exchange reserves and put in place far better external debt management. Still the situation bears close scrutiny and alongside continued Fed tightening this year will put pressure on emerging markets\u2019 currencies over 2016.\u201d It\u2019s a bad day for stock market bulls..... The Economist reckons China could trigger a repeat of the 1998 Asian crisis, rather than the 2008 vintage which George Soros fears. Here\u2019s its logic: If China devalues, then other Asian nations will come under pressure to follow suit, for fear of losing competitive position. That will trigger worries about those Asian companies that have borrowed in dollars. there could be banking issues in Asia. This is a potentially worrying scenario. Whether 2008 is the right parallel is another matter. If the bearish case does come true, then it sounds more like 1998 when a round of Asian devaluations was triggered by the realisation that growth had been fuelled by speculation. Western economies did manage to overcome that crisis. The real worry is that emerging countries are a lot more important for the global economy than they were back then. More here: Is this really 2008 all over again? Investor-turned-philanthropist George Soros has contributed to the gloom today, by claiming that we could face a repeat of the turmoil we experienced in 2008. Soros, who famously beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday, told an audience in Sri Lanka that the current situation reminded him of the financial crisis seven years ago. He said: \u201cChina has a major adjustment problem. I would say it amounts to a crisis. When I look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in 2008.\u201d Alarming stuff. However, before you sell everything, it\u2019s worth remembering that Soros has previous form here. In 2011, he declared that the eurozone debt crisis was \u201cmore serious\u201d than the 08 crash. European policymakers managed to avoid a Lehman Brothers-style moment, although obviously Greece\u2019s problems aren\u2019t fixed. So Soros\u2019s words are worth taking seriously... Some Chinese companies could be forced into default if Beijing continues to devalue the yuan. So argues Danae Kyriakopoulou, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. She warns: Many Chinese corporates have taken on a lot of debt, some of it dollar-denominated. This exposure creates an important risk as the People\u2019s Bank of China PBOC continues to allow the yuan to weaken. It is not far-fetched at this stage to draw comparisons with the Asian currency crises of 1998 that occurred as economies with high levels of dollar-denominated debts were forced to devalue. This, together with the commitment by the Chinese leadership to give market forces a greater say may mean that we will see many more corporate defaults in China this year. As covered earlier, Beijing has already spent half a trillion dollars propping up the yuan this year. It still has more than $3trn left to help engineer an \u2018orderly\u2019 devaluation.... What. A. Morning. Nearly four hours after trading began, the FTSE 100 is still deep in the red as the latest crash in China spooks markets around the globe. The blue-chip index is currently down 2.65% or 160 points at 5912, its lowest level since mid December. That, by my calculations, wipes more than \u00a340bn off the value of the 100 companies on the Footsie. A blow that will be shared by City traders, pension funds and small investors alike. Mining companies continue to suffer, on fears that the crisis in China will cause serious harm to the global economy. Anglo American, which produces iron ore, copper, nickel and coal, has slumped to another record low. Fund manager Aberdeen Asset Management is also being hit hard; it manages tens of billions of assets in emerging markets and in Asia. The news that the yuan hit a five-year low today - effectively a devaluation by Beijing - is also worrying investors. Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets, says: UK and European stocks are extending declines in one of the worst opening weeks for the year for stock markets in recent memory. China is at the top of a dizzying list of concerns for markets. And with oil hitting a fresh 11-year low, and the pound at its weakest since 2010, there\u2019s plenty for investors to fret about. Connor Campbell of Spreadex sums up the mood: There have been painfully few chinks of light this morning, the markets covered in an almost impenetrable cloud of bearish fog. There are anxious faces on the Frankfurt stock market, as traders watched shares slide. The DAX index fell by over 3% this morning, dropping through the 10,000 point mark for the first time since October. German exporters such as BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen and ThyssenKrupp led the selloff, all falling by around 4%. They are all vulnerable to a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy. Wall Street is expected to join the selloff when trading begins in three and a half-hours. The futures market suggest the Dow Jones industrial average will tumble by 2.5%, while the Nasdaq is heading for a 3.3% plunge. The pound appears to be suffering from the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. Andy Scott, economist at currency firm HiFX, reckons Brexit risks are compounding the impact of the China crisis on the UK currency. He explains: Sterling\u2019s decline against a rising US Dollar has been accelerated by the risk-off mode this week that has investors seeking refuge in safe haven currencies including the US Dollar, Japanese Yen and the Swiss Franc. That can almost entirely be attributed to the Chinese central bank allowing its currency to weaken to its lowest level against the dollar in almost five years, fuelling speculation that the economy is slowing faster than official figures suggest. \u201cConcerns over a Brexit and reduced bets that the Bank of England will hike rates any time soon have also weighed on Sterling. \u201cThe Bank of England and the Chancellor have been quite vocal about risks facing the UK economy this year and the early signs are that China\u2019s economy is weakening further, putting a bigger question mark over global growth And that\u2019s why the pound is at a five and a half-year low of $1.456 today, as this chart shows: Veteran analyst David Buik, who has seen a few crashes in his time, says there is an \u201cacrid stench of fear\u201d in the City and Canary Wharf. He adds: The start to the year has been metaphorical carnage as far as equities are concerned. China has set the agenda with two gargantuan falls this year, aided and abetted by oil falling to its lowest level in 12 years (-4% today) suggesting that investors are not happy campers! Panda bear market, anyone? We have a glimmer of good news - Europe\u2019s unemployment crisis has eased a little. The eurozone\u2019s jobless rate dipped to 10.5% in November 2011, according to eurostat, which is the lowest since October 2011. That still leaves 16.924 million people out of work in the euro area, and 22.159 million in the wider European Union. So, still too high - and at risk of rising again if the global economy hits serious problems again.... China isn\u2019t the only developing economy to make a bad start to 2016. A swath of emerging market currencies have weakened since the start of the year, as investors fear that their economies will falter. Greece\u2019s stock market is sharing the pain: City traders may have now dried off after the early morning deluge, but their mood isn\u2019t any sunnier. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Markets says: Not unlike the weather in London today, it never rains but it pours. While it\u2019s said that the darkest hour is often before the dawn, nobody appears brave enough to involve themselves in risk assets this morning. She explains how the Chinese market suspension, the slump in crude oil, and the big drop in China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are all causing alarm: The drop in oil prices and China\u2019s Shanghai Composite once again triggering circuit breakers sees major European indexes under pressure while government bonds strengthen across the board. Trading in China stopped after 29 minutes amid the Shanghai\u2019s Composite tumbled by 7.04%. Forex reserves in China are also lower than what were expected. At the end of December they stood at $3.33 trillion and given that the IMF has recently said that $2.6T is required to maintain the yuan fix, this worse than expected depletion is only bolstering negativity towards the world\u2019s second biggest economy. A reminder of what triggered today\u2019s rout: As if there wasn\u2019t already enough to worry about, China has revealed a record drop in its foreign exchange reserves. New data from the People\u2019s Bank of China show that its FX reserves shrank by $107bn in December - the biggest monthly drop on record. It suggests that China was forced to use more firepower supporting the yuan last month, as capital flows out of the Chinese economy: Sterling has just hit its lowest level against the US dollar since the middle of 2010. The pound has lost half a cent against the greenback today, hitting $1.4561. That\u2019s a five and a half-year low, taking us back to the uncertain times after the 2010 general election. Worried traders are piling money into the relative safety of the dollar. As this chart shows, the pound looks stronger against a basket of currencies: China\u2019s new \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 is meant to avoid market volatility. It clearly doesn\u2019t work. As it stands, if the market falls 5% then trading is suspended for everyone to calm down. It then reopens, allowing investors to recover their nerve. But as we saw today, a second wave of selling can quickly push the market down by 7% - which is the signal to end trading for the day. Mark Dampier, head of investment Research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says authorities need to accept that shares are simply overvalued: Some amazing events on the Chinese stock markets overnight with trading halted for the second time in a week, the second time this year after just 870 seconds of trading..... Clearly the circuit breaker is having the opposite affect to what is intended and is making things worse. It also stops the market having any chance of bouncing. Had it been introduced during 2015, it would have been triggered 20 times. The system doesn\u2019t work and until it is withdrawn or modified we can expect to see further use and perhaps shorter trading periods than we saw last night. The interference by the authorities is simply delaying the inevitable. The market needs to find its own level so we will see more volatility in global markets until it does. Today\u2019s selloff is causing a lot of angst in the City, and sending investors running for cover. Terry Torrison, managing director at Monaco-based McLaren Securities, says: \u201cThe extent of the slowdown in China is certainly a worry. Investor sentiment is very fragile at the moment.\u201d Andreas Clenow, hedge fund manager and chief investment officer at ACIES Asset Management, is equally alarmed: \u201cIt\u2019s looking pretty ugly. We\u2019ve been scaling down equity positions. It\u2019s time to take a step back to re-evaluate the situation.\u201d (via Reuters) The Financial Times has a rather smuttier take on Marc Bolland\u2019s time at Marks &amp; Spencer: Good point, boss. Marks and Spencer is defying the global rout! Its shares are up 1.5%, making it the only riser on the FTSE 100. The City appears to be applauding the news that Marc Bolland is retiring. Joshua Raymond Chief Marketing Officer at XTB.com explains why: Bolland has been under intense pressure from major shareholders for his failure to grow the business. And when you look at their recent results, its easy to understand why Bolland had to go and the tough job his replacement, Mr Rowe now finds himself in. Somewhat paradoxically, I expect shareholders to react well to the news that Bolland will now depart after months of speculation. A drop of 5.8% in general merchandise is simply awful and at the bottom of market expectations. Whilst the firm did enjoy what it claimed was its best ever Christmas week for food sales, like for like food sales over the Q3 period grew 0.4%, which is disappointing though shows M&amp;S fared better than some of its competitors. Overall like for like UK sales fell 2.5%. Here\u2019s our news story on Bolland\u2019s exit: The Stoxx 600, which tracks the largest 600 companies across Europe, has fallen by 2.2% this morning. By my reckoning, that\u2019s a three-month low: European markets are also being hit hard, as fears over China\u2019s economy ripple through global bourses. Germany\u2019s DAX is leading the selloff, tumbling by 2.75% or 281 points to 9,932. Every share in Frankfurt is down, as investors fear that the powerhouse Eurozone economy will suffer if China\u2019s economy hits serious trouble. The French CAC is close behind, down 2.2%. The FTSE 100 has tumbled by over 100 points at the start of trading, shedding almost 2% of its value. The blue-chip index is being dragged down by mining stocks, but every single share is in the red. It\u2019s down 114 points, or 1.9%, right now. The slump in China\u2019s stock market is one obvious factor - but it\u2019s not the only one. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors face a serious of concerns: Equity markets are continuing their steep losses as we enter the final part of the trading week with investor sentiment being pressured by various different factors. This includes the resumption of fears over global growth following weak data from China in the beginning of the year, while increased geo-political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran and an unexpected nuclear test from North Korea have also encouraged investors to dodge away from riskier assets like stocks. Another threat to investor sentiment is the persistent and continued weakness in the commodity markets, which only today saw the price of oil falling to a fresh 11 year lows of $32.70 for the first time since 2004. Ding ding..... the European stock markets are open. Brace yourselves for a wave of selling..... If you can\u2019t sell shares, you may as well crack on with the knitting..... Crude oil prices are taking another kicking, tumbling over 5% in early trading. Brent crude has plunged below $33/barrel for the first time since 2004. It\u2019s currently changing hands at just $32.25 per barrel, a new 11-year low. And US crude oil has also slumped by 5%, to $32.10 per barrel. The Chinese stock market really did suffer a precipitous decline today, triggering the circuit breaker that brought trading to a very early close: City traders are bracing for a grim start to trading - once they\u2019ve dried themselves (it\u2019s wet today) Asian stock markets are a deep and grimy sea of red today, as fears over China rattle investors across the region. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell over 2%, shedding 423 points to close at 17,767 points. It\u2019s now down 6.65% since the start of the year. The Hong Kong Hang Seng index is currently down 2.8%, Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX is down 2.2% , India\u2019s Sensex has lost 1.9%. Chinese regulators held an emergency meeting today to discuss the crisis -- but they haven\u2019t taken any decision on new action, Bloomberg reports. From Beijing, my colleague Tom Phillips sums up the dramatic action in China today: China halted the day\u2019s trading within 30 minutes of opening on Thursday morning as shares plunged by more than 7% \u2013 triggering an automatic \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d \u2013 and authorities accelerated the devaluation of the Chinese yuan. China\u2019s recently installed \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism paused trading for 15 minutes after the CSI300 index fell 5% in the first 13 minutes of trading. On resumption of trading it fell further, triggering the day\u2019s halt. The CSI300 index finished down 7.2%, the SSE composite index fell 7.3% and Shenzhen dropped by 8.3%. Experts believe that the Chinese authorities may have to take fresh steps to prevent the rout deepening, Tom explains: Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC business school, said he expected more government action to halt the stock market drops, \u201cwhether it is changing the circuit breakers, whether it is again intervening in the market, whether it is extending the ban on large selling by institutions.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if they let this continue going down. By almost any measure, the Chinese stock market is pretty over valued and so you would be looking at a pretty significant fall to get back to a reasonable valuation. I would be surprised if they allowed it to move back to more appropriate levels.\u201d \u201c2016 in China is getting off on the wrong foot.\u201d Here\u2019s Tom\u2019s full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s no escape from the China crisis. Trading in Shanghai has been suspended for the second time this week, after its stock market plunged at the start of trading. Automatic circuit-breakers kicked in, leaving nervous investors cooling their heels, after shares in Chinese companies slumped by 7% at the start of trading. The selloff came as the yuan weakened further against the US dollar, fuelling concerns over China\u2019s economic situation. From Melbourne, analyst Angus Nicholson of trading firm IG explains: The great concern for global markets is that the dramatic pace of the currency devaluation seems to indicate a far greater weakness in the Chinese economy than is easily perceivable in its publicly released statistics. A lot of people in the market are speculating that this is primarily about boosting exports and stimulating the slowing economy. While this no doubt will help, the primary concern for the government is deflation. Asian markets tumbled following the developments in China, and European stocks are expected to fall heavily at the open too. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is expected to suffer a triple-digit loss: All in all, it\u2019s a great day for UK chancellor George Osborne is due to give a speech warning that Britain is vulnerable to problems in the global economy. And we\u2019ll also be digesting financial results from UK retailers Marks &amp; Spencer and Poundland. The big news at 7am is that M&amp;S\u2019s CEO Marc Bolland is stepping down, after six tricky years at the helm (statement here). Today\u2019s results don\u2019t look great, frankly, with sales of general merchandise down 5% over the crucial Christmas period....",

      "bodyText": "US stocks continued to fall on Thursday as fears of an economic slowdown in China spooked investors around the world. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 392.41 points, or 2.32%, capping its worst four-day start to a year in more than a century. The S&amp;P 500 posted its largest daily drop since September, losing 47.17 points, or 2.37%, to 1,943.09 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 146.34 points, or 3%, to 4,689.43. The falls followed another day of turmoil on the world\u2019s stock markets amid more signs that the Chinese economy is slowing. China moved early to try to head off more panic, scrapping a new mechanism that Beijing had initially hoped would prevent sharp selloffs. Beijing suspended the use of \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d introduced to halt trading after dramatic selloffs. The circuit breakers appear to have exacerbated the selloffs, as would-be sellers waited for the markets to open again in order to sell. The decision came after the breaker was tripped for the second time in a week as the market fell 7% within half an hour of opening. Signs of problems in the world\u2019s second largest economy triggered selling in Europe.

The supermarket, which has until 2 February to make a new offer for the owner of Argos and Homebase after a first bid was rejected last month, said the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) had not taken any position on the proposed \u00a31bn-plus Home Retail Group transaction. \u201cLike any other shareholder, the QIA would consider any such proposal in detail before making a decision on its position,\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s said in a statement to the stock exchange. The statement was issued after the Guardian reported that the QIA, which has a 25% stake in Sainsbury\u2019s, was uneasy about its proposed acquisition of Home Retail Group. It is understood that the QIA\u2019s position, which it has made clear to the retailer, is that it doesn\u2019t want its stake to be diluted but nor does it wish to invest more in the company at the present time. Sainsbury\u2019s made clear earlier this week that it had made a cash and shares bid for Home Retail in November. If such a deal were to go ahead it would require the issuing of new equity, which would dilute the QIA\u2019s stake unless it paid out for more shares. If the investment firm\u2019s concerns about the dilution of its stake in Sainsbury\u2019s could be satisfied it may yet back a deal. Those that know the QIA strategy well say that its current strategy is to diversify its investment portfolio away from Europe rather than pour more money into the continent. The statement from Sainsbury\u2019s begins: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s notes the article in the Guardian. We understand that the QIA is not the source of the story.\u201d The QIA itself, which is customarily private, did not make any public statement. If the value of any bid is worth more than a quarter of the supermarket\u2019s market value, it would require shareholder approval. Any opposition from the QIA could potentially block a deal. The deal is said to be being driven by the retailer\u2019s chair David Tyler, who made the initial approach to Home Retail\u2019s chair John Coombe in November. Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, is said to have opposed a similar deal several years ago but is now keen to get investors onside. Sainsbury\u2019s, which has Argos outlets in a handful of its stores, is considering its position after its plans for a bid were revealed earlier this week. Analysts said the supermarket was likely to come back with a new offer for Home Retail. Shares in the Argos owner rose 2.7% to 136p on Thursday as some analysts said Sainsbury\u2019s might need to make an offer of as much as 180p a share.",

      "bodyText": "When a Ford Fiesta collided with a double-decker party bus packed with revellers on a roundabout in Crewe it could have been a very nasty accident. Luckily the Fiesta was travelling at less than 10mph and there was just a small split in the car\u2019s bumper and a \u00a370 bill to fix the bus. Then came the real impact \u2013 a \u00a3250,000 insurance claim when every one of the 46 passengers said they had suffered a whiplash injury. The details of the huge insurance claim were released on Thursday by insurance group Aviva, which had insured the driver of the Fiesta. The accident happened as the Fiesta\u2019s owner tried to overtake the doubledecker bus at low speed and was caught out as the bus turned onto the roundabout. Aviva accepted split liability for the accident with the insurer of the party bus. The car driver, described the impact as minimal. Most of the passengers on board were said to have been unaware of the collision at the time and none received medical attention before going on to spend the evening at a nightclub. But shortly afterwards each of them submitted a claim for whiplash. The injury, which can take hours to be felt and causes neck pain and headaches, happens when the head is suddenly thrown forwards, backwards or sideways. The UK has become known as the whiplash capital of Europe due to the high level of claims made by those involved in accidents. While in France just 3% of motor injury claims are for whiplash, in the UK the figure is 80%. Some insurers automatically pay out on all whiplash claims up to \u00a33,000 because it is is cheaper to pay up than fight a case. Aviva, which has been an outspoken critic of the UK\u2019s laws on whiplash payouts, decided to fight the party bus claim, saying it believed the injuries were inconsistent with the damage caused to the vehicles. But after the insurer rejected the claims, 23 of the partygoers then hired lawyers to fight their case and were able to supply medical evidence to lawyers in support of their claim. Aviva, however, didn\u2019t give up, and eventually all the claimants dropped their claims before they went to court. Tom Gardiner, the head of fraud at Aviva, said: \u201cThis claim highlights the outrageous scale of whiplash fraud in the UK being driven by the current system, and which frankly has become a national disgrace. \u201cWe believe our customers are fed up paying for spurious and fraudulent injury claims through their premiums and they expect us to defend these claims on their behalf.\u201d The incident happened in September 2012, but those who had their claims rejected had three years to seek legal representation and appeal, so Aviva has only now been able to close the case \u2013 and make it public. The insurance company said that for every \u00a31 it pays out in compensation for whiplash it spends another 80p to cover lawyers\u2019 fees. It has been lobbying the government to make claims more difficult,and wants the period people have to make a claim cut to 12 months from the date of an accident. The insurer uncovered the claim as part of an operation in the north-west focusing on staged accidents involving buses and multiple claimants. It described the claims as \u201copportunistic\u201d, but said its fraud unit is dealing with more than 4,000 suspect whiplash claims linked to organised \u201ccash for crash\u201d claims - where people submit false claims for damage and personal injury related to staged car accidents. In November\u2019s autumn statement the chancellor, George Osborne, announced a crackdown on claims, which could lead to the end of cash compensation and reduce drivers\u2019 premiums by \u00a350 a year. The Association of British Insurers sid that whiplash policies cost \u00a32bn a year \u2013 an average of \u00a390 for each motor insurance policy. A spokeswoman said: \u201cWhen people suffer genuine personal injury they deserve help which insurers are committed to providing. \u201cHowever, frivolous and exaggerated personal injury claims, especially for whiplash, create unnecessary costs which impact premium paying customers.\u201d Matt Oliver, car insurance spokesperson at the comparison website Gocompare.com, said some of those making false claims view it as \u201ca victimless crime, that only affects the insurance company\u201d, but all motorists were paying for it. \u201cA large part of the problem is due to some rogue claims management companies who cold call drivers following an accident to encourage them to make inflated injury claims under the promise of receiving a large pay out,\u201d he said. \u201cTougher rules are needed to prevent these companies from turning minor accidents into major personal injury claims in the pursuit of profit.\u201d Aviva has previously revealed details of other cases where it rejected claims, including the case of a semi-professional footballer who tweeted about playing a match 24 hours after an accident in which he said he had been injured. Recently, law firm Thompsons Solicitors, which specialises in personal injury claims, said insurers were exaggerating the levels of fraud to reduce the rights of consumers. It said Aviva\u2019s own figures suggested that it was investigating just 5% of claims it received.",

      "bodyText": "Marc Bolland\u2019s dash for the exit at Marks &amp; Spencer is well timed. He could, almost certainly, have survived yet another set of dire clothing sales figures because the food division continued its strong run over Christmas. What\u2019s more, the chairman, Robert Swannell, has never seemed the axe-wielding type. A departure in April suits all parties. Bolland gets to choose his moment and can point out correctly that six years counts as a long stint for a FTSE 100 chief executive these days. The new boss, Steve Rowe, who did four good years in food, had seemed earmarked for the top job since he was switched last July to clothing. Best to get him in post before his food halo slipped with the rotten 5.8% like-for-like decline in general merchandise over the festive period. The verdict on Bolland\u2019s reign? Better than his critics make out. He made a mistake at the outset by saying M&amp;S could be rewired into \u201ca truly international, multichannel retailer\u201d within three years and had to abandon his sales targets within 12 months. But the level of past underinvestment at M&amp;S also became apparent. The warehousing system was a shambles and the website had been outsourced in panic to Amazon in 2004. An expensive infrastructure job was necessary, taking the website in-house and forcing capital expenditure above \u00a3800m a year for a while. The successful part of Bolland\u2019s reign is this: he did the behind-the-scenes rebuilding (with a few hiccups) while leaving the balance sheet stronger than he found it. That\u2019s worth a lot. The fashion failure is, of course, glaring. Managers and designers were shuffled, supply chains overhauled, and buying terms improved. Yet like-for-like sales have gone backwards for five years. The semi-consolation for investors is that profits margins were protected at Christmas, as Bolland promised they would be. Such a defensive strategy works until it doesn\u2019t. Sooner or later, a clothing retailer with vast acres of floorspace has to shift more clobber, rather than merely protect margins via efficiency gains. M&amp;S, like the supermarkets, has too much space for the internet era. Bolland barely scratched that issue. But, as a nuts-and-bolts operator, which is what M&amp;S needed in 2010, Bolland deserves credit. As with another high-profile Dutchman, Louis van Gaal at Manchester United, the punters are screaming for more flair but the league position \u2013 or shareholder returns \u2013 is respectable. Under Bolland, M&amp;S has averaged a total return, meaning dividends plus share price growth, of about 10% a year. Not bad. China finally abandons cack-handed circuit breakers Hurrah, the Chinese regulators have learned that, when in a hole, you should stop digging. They have suspended the circuit-breakers that have closed local stock markets twice this week. The cut-off mechanism always looked likely to cause, rather than prevent, chaos. The design was cack-handed. The trigger for trading to be paused for 15 minutes was set at just 5%, which hardly counts as an exceptional occurrence for a young stock market like China\u2019s. Worse, the system dictated that trading should be abandoned for the day after a 7% decline. Once 5% was hit, a further slide became a near-certainty as sellers tried to get out while they still had the chance. The good news is that share prices will, in theory, have the chance to bounce after a quick fall. The bad news is that a seriously big fall is also possible. Indeed, the latter seems more likely because the bubble that developed between June 2014 and May 2015 \u2013 when the Shanghai composite index rose 150% \u2013 has never deflated. This week\u2019s 12% slide in index move valuations towards saner territory. But a reasonable case can be made that Chinese stocks are still over-priced by anything up to 50%, especially if the yuan is now being allowed to decline gradually against the dollar. More holes loom. Saudi Aramco\u2019s IPO plan raises eyebrows Who floats a company when its profits are collapsing? Saudi Arabia, that\u2019s who. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company that makes Exxon and Shell look like tiddlers, is heading for the public markets. Maybe. Muhammad bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s deputy crown prince, told the Economist a listing \u201cis something that is being reviewed.\u201d Quite how many trillions Aramco would be worth when the oil price is at $33 is anybody\u2019s guess, but fewer than it once was. So why think of selling even a small slice of equity? There are two possible explanations. Perhaps the Saudis feel a parade of Aramco\u2019s worth will remind the ruling regime\u2019s doubters of the resources at their disposal. Alternatively, with an austerity budget in place and welfare spending being cut, the financial pressures on the regime are even more intense than they appear.",

Not bad.</p> <h2>China finally abandons cack-handed circuit breakers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7fd5116b8588d666ae31a5c5b1b30d922b1b308\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7fd5116b8588d666ae31a5c5b1b30d922b1b308/0_0_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Chinese investor looks through stock information in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Chinese investor looks through stock information in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hurrah, the Chinese regulators have learned that, when in a hole, you should stop digging. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/07/stock-markets-slide-after-china-suspends-trading-again-live-updates\">They have suspended the circuit-breakers that have closed local stock markets twice this week</a>.</p> <p>The cut-off mechanism always looked likely to cause, rather than prevent, chaos. The design was cack-handed. The trigger for trading to be paused for 15 minutes was set at just 5%, which hardly counts as an exceptional occurrence for a young stock market like China\u2019s. Worse, the system dictated that trading should be abandoned for the day after a 7% decline. Once 5% was hit, a further slide became a near-certainty as sellers tried to get out while they still had the chance.</p> <p>The good news is that share prices will, in theory, have the chance to bounce after a quick fall. The bad news is that a seriously big fall is also possible. Indeed, the latter seems more likely because the bubble that developed between June 2014 and May 2015 \u2013 when the Shanghai composite index rose 150% \u2013 has never deflated.</p> <p>This week\u2019s 12% slide in index move valuations towards saner territory. But a reasonable case can be made that Chinese stocks are still over-priced by anything up to 50%, especially if the yuan is now being allowed to decline gradually against the dollar. More holes loom.</p> <h2>Saudi Aramco\u2019s IPO plan raises eyebrows</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1eac041df785cf5bc999e877f3f3edee726fd3a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eac041df785cf5bc999e877f3f3edee726fd3a2/0_539_4916_2949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The sun sets behind an oil pump in Sakhir, Bahrain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sun sets behind an oil pump in Sakhir, Bahrain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Who floats a company when its profits are collapsing? Saudi Arabia, that\u2019s who. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company that makes Exxon and Shell look like tiddlers, is heading for the public markets. Maybe. Muhammad bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s deputy crown prince, told the Economist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/07/saudi-arabia-considers-ipo-national-oil-group-aramco\">a listing \u201cis something that is being reviewed.\u201d</a><br></p> <p>Quite how many trillions Aramco would be worth when the oil price is at $33 is anybody\u2019s guess, but fewer than it once was. So why think of selling even a small slice of equity? There are two possible explanations. Perhaps the Saudis feel a parade of Aramco\u2019s worth will remind the ruling regime\u2019s doubters of the resources at their disposal. Alternatively, with an austerity budget in place and welfare spending being cut, the financial pressures on the regime are even more intense than they appear.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chinese authorities sought to bring an end to new year stock market turmoil with a dramatic U-turn on a new mechanism that Beijing had hoped would prevent sharp selloffs. On Thursday, in a tacit admission that the new circuit breakers introduced only this week were having the opposite effect to that intended, China\u2019s main stock exchanges said they were suspending the mechanism. The move came after the breaker was tripped for the second time in a week as the market fell 7% within half an hour of opening. China\u2019s plunging share prices and the country\u2019s moves to guide its yuan currency lower sent shockwaves around already jittery global markets and, in a dramatic day of trading, \u00a330bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 and oil prices hit fresh multiyear lows. As the UK chancellor, George Osborne, warned against complacency over the recovery, the pound tumbled to a five and a half year low against the dollar. Stock markets and Brent crude clawed back some ground after China\u2019s circuit breaker announcement, but investors said the mood remained cautious after a torrid start to 2016 that has seen the FTSE 100 fall almost 5% this week and the Dow Jones industrial average in the US shed about 4%. The FTSE closed down almost 2% at 5,954 on Thursday. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at the Spreadex spread-betting firm, said: \u201cWhile still pretty dire, the global indices appear to have been briefly calmed ... by news that China will be suspending the stock market circuit breaker rule that has wreaked such havoc this week,. \u201cIt seems that investors, for now at least, are taking the news as a positive, the move ostensibly preventing the panic-pause-more panic pattern that appeared in the Chinese markets on Monday and Thursday from repeating itself. That\u2019s the theory, at least; we\u2019ll just have to see how it works in practice.\u201d The circuit breaker announcement followed a string of ill-fated moves by China to curb volatility on its stock markets and shore up faltering economic growth. Interest-rate cuts, currency interventions and stock market reforms over the past year have failed to restore international confidence in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. A spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said: \u201cThe circuit breaker mechanism was not the main reason for the market slump. It just didn\u2019t work as anticipated based on actual situations. The negative effect of the mechanism outweighed its positive effect.\u201d In a sign of rising concern over flagging exports, China allowed its yuan currency to depreciate further and currencies in neighbouring markets also weakened. While stock market moves have little impact on the strength of the real economy, China\u2019s currency moves were more concerning, analysts said. \u201cTalk of China exporting deflation has returned, together with \u201cthey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing\u201d and \u201cthey must have seen something bad in the economic data\u201d\u201d, said Ian Kernohan, an economist at Royal London Asset Management. \u201cWith the economic data likely to be more difficult to read during the first quarter, thanks to China\u2019s New Year holiday, greater clarity on currency policy will be needed to calm markets.\u201d Chinese stock markets have been hit this week by a mix of weaker economic data and the prospect of a ban on share sales by major stakeholders being lifted. The market turmoil and the yuan\u2019s depreciation have fanned fears that China\u2019s slowdown will be more pronounced than policymakers have warned. The country\u2019s central bank has said it expects growth in 2015 to be the slowest for a quarter of a century. In the UK, the prospect of tougher export markets exacerbated worries about the economic outlook and traders pushed back their forecasts for an interest hike from the Bank of England this year. That helped knock the pound to its lowest level against the dollar since 2010, at $1.4530. There is a growing view that the Bank will hold off until at least late this year to start raising interest rates from the record low of 0.5%, where they have been since the financial crisis in 2009. One factor allowing Bank policymakers time to sit on their hands is low inflation, which has been close to zero for months, helped by a dramatic fall in global oil prices. On Thursday, US figures showing oil production had risen added to worries about a supply glut and Brent crude fell to its lowest for almost 12 years. It hit $32.16 per barrel at one point, before recovering in later trading to around $34. Before a sombre speech on the economic outlook, Osborne said the UK should be ready for higher borrowing costs, which he described as a sign of a strong economy, as cited by the US Federal Reserve when it hiked rates in America last month. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be ready. But ultimately, if and when interest rates go up, that will be a sign of a stronger economy that is normalising after the extraordinary crisis of seven or eight years ago,\u201d he told BBC radio. Osborne used his speech in Cardiff to warn of the risks to the UK from the shaky global economy, saying 2016 has opened with a \u201cdangerous cocktail of new threats\u201d. But the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, pointed to the government\u2019s \u201cfailed economic policies\u201d, saying \u201cit\u2019s a cocktail of his own mixture\u201d.",

Nigel Greenaway, who leads the company\u2019s south division, is retiring after nearly 30 years with the firm. He was handed 1.5m shares in 2012 under the 10-year share plan and will receive a portion of his award on a pro-rata basis. Persimmon declined to comment as the award has yet to be determined by its remuneration committee. At Thursday\u2019s share price, and reducing the exercise price by the dividends paid to date, his payout for a four-year period could amount to \u00a39.4m. Greenaway will retire at the housebuilder\u2019s annual meeting on 14 April. David Jenkinson has been promoted to managing director with immediate effect, reporting directly to the chief executive, Jeff Fairburn. News of the board changes came days after it emerged that Persimmon\u2019s former boss Mike Farley, who retired in January 2013 after seven years at the helm and 30 years at the company, collected shares worth nearly \u00a316m at the end of December. The bonus scheme means that Persimmon\u2019s top 160 managers will be awarded 30m shares worth \u00a3585m at Thursday\u2019s share price if they hit a target to return \u00a31.9bn to shareholders over the 10-year period that began in 2011. Rival housebuilder Berkeley Homes also has a generous bonus scheme for its executives. In a trading update, Persimmon said it built 14,572 homes last year, up 8% from 2014. Revenues climbed 13% to \u00a32.9bn as the average selling price rose 4.5% to \u00a3199,100. Housebuilders came under fire this week when figures from the Local Government Association showed that nearly half a million homes in England and Wales have planning permission but are yet to be built, despite Britain\u2019s housing shortage. The Guardian revealed last week that the nine biggest housebuilders have enough land to build 615,152 homes. This includes plots with planning permission and those without.",

      "bodyText": "EDF is considering the sale of a \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.2bn) stake in its British nuclear business in a bid to raise cash for new Hinkley Point reactors. Possible buyers would be state-owned Chinese companies, who are already committed partners on the \u00a318bn Somerset project. EDF could unveil details of a sell-off plan on 16 February, when it is scheduled to release annual financial figures and is expected to give a final investment decision on building Britain\u2019s first new reactors for 20 years. The French daily, Les Echos, reported on Thursday that EDF may reduce its stake in the eight existing nuclear reactors it owns from 80% to 51% by bringing in a new investor as part of a wider \u20ac6bn disposal programme. Industry sources told the Guardian that the possible sell off was only one of a number of different options that were under consideration as the group looked at financing Hinkley Point C and other projects. They said it was still likely EDF would give the go ahead to Hinkley next month even though it did not have all the financing in place. The project is estimated to cost \u00a318bn, according to EDF, though the European Union has warned it could go as high as \u00a324bn. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, already has a 20% holding but has made clear in the past that it does not want a larger commitment to nuclear, and declined to participate in the Hinkley newbuild scheme. The entire existing nuclear fleet, made up of advanced gas reactors such as those at Hinkley Point B in Somerset and Dungeness B in Kent, have a book value of \u20ac9bn. Chinese firms have already agreed to take a one-third stake in the Hinkley project and are keen to build their own new reactors at Bradwell, another site currently used by EDF in Essex. EDF struggled to interest anyone else in the Hinkley scheme, which many in the City have deemed over-expensive, so the Chinese would seem first in line to buy into the rest of the EDF nuclear business if it comes up for grabs. EDF is also said by Les Echos to be considering disposing of a half stake in the Constellation Energy nuclear group in the US, plus a a similar option to ditch its 50% holding in power transmission business RTE. Over the last six months the company\u2019s chief executive, Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, has made clear he is reviewing various parts of the business in a bid to pay for a range of new commitments and rising debt levels. EDF has been pressured by the government to buy a stake in its ailing engineering partner, Areva, and must set aside at least \u20ac55bn to upgrade its huge fleet of French reactors following safety concerns raised by the Fukushima accident in Japan. Environmentalists opposed to EDF\u2019s new building plans in Britain believe the company may yet be forced to abandon Hinkley Point C because of a European legal challenge against the state aid promised by the UK.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Saudi Arabia considers IPO for national oil group, Aramco", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia is considering a stock market listing for its national oil group \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest energy company and probably the most valuable company on the planet. Saudi Aramco is a highly secretive organisation but is likely to be valued at well over $1tn (\u00a3685bn). Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country. Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time. \u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money. The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit. Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said. Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers. Some question whether this strategy could change in the run-up to any Aramco IPO. He was happy for the Economist to depict his planned new policies as Thatcherite, saying he was \u201cmost certainly\u201d wanting to follow the free market economic path the former UK prime minster had pioneered. Western oil companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil may be very interested in an opportunity to buy into Saudi Aramco \u2013 even when their own balance sheets are being stretched by a collapsing crude values. But other state-owned petroleum groups, from China and elsewhere, would also be keen to take a stake in a company that controls more than 260bn barrels of reserves. Saudi Aramco produces all of Saudi\u2019s 10.25m barrels a day, which is more than double that of Exxon and Rosneft in Russia. The Saudi prince, who is also the defence minister, said it was right of his country to suspend diplomatic relations with fellow Opec member and regional power rival Iran, but played down any prospects of physical conflict. He said: \u201cA war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is the beginning of a major catastrophe in the region ... For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201d The mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices. Middle East tension usually raises oil trader fears that production or transport could be hit. But in recent days the direction of travel for prices has only been downwards as sentiment concentrated on increasing supplies and weakening demand. The US has released new figures showing shale output growing, while Chinese economic data all points to further factory slowdowns.",

Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country.</p> <p>Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/saudi_interview\">confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine</a> that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time.</p> <p>\u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d </p> <p>The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. </p> <p>The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.</p> <p>The country is under pressure, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/30/oil-prices-plummet-again-despite-saudi-output\">oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years</a> and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.</p> <p>Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers. Some question whether this strategy could change in the run-up to any Aramco IPO.</p> <p>He was happy for the Economist to depict his planned new policies as Thatcherite, saying he was \u201cmost certainly\u201d wanting to follow the free market economic path the former UK prime minster had pioneered.</p> <p>Western oil companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil may be very interested in an opportunity to buy into Saudi Aramco \u2013 even when their own balance sheets are being stretched by a collapsing crude values.</p> <p>But other state-owned petroleum groups, from China and elsewhere, would also be keen to take a stake in a company that controls more than 260bn barrels of reserves.</p> <p>Saudi Aramco produces all of Saudi\u2019s 10.25m barrels a day, which is more than double that of Exxon and Rosneft in Russia.</p> <p>The Saudi prince, who is also the defence minister, said it was right of his country to suspend diplomatic relations with fellow Opec member and regional power rival Iran, but played down any prospects of physical conflict.</p> <p>He said: \u201cA war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is the beginning of a major catastrophe in the region ... For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201d</p> <p>The mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices. Middle East tension usually raises oil trader fears that production or transport could be hit.</p> <p>But in recent days the direction of travel for prices has only been downwards as sentiment concentrated on increasing supplies and weakening demand. The US has released new figures showing shale output growing, while Chinese economic data all points to further factory slowdowns.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New car sales reached an all-time high in Britain in 2015 as improving consumer confidence, wage growth and low-interest finance deals from manufacturers boosted the market. A total of 2.63m new cars hit the UK\u2019s roads an increase of 6.3% on 2014 and above the previous record of 2.58m, set in 2003. The head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which provided the figures, said the British market ha d a remarkable period of growth. New car sales in December were also a record, rising by 8.4% year-on-year to 180,077 vehicles. Sales rose despite a 0.4% fall for Volkswagen, the third-biggest brand in the country behind Ford and Vauxhall, as customers turned against the carmaker after the diesel emissions scandal. It is only the fourth time UK car sales have surpassed 2.5m in a calendar year. Sales have risen for four consecutive years, although analysts warned the market could be flat in 2016. Car sales have been boosted by the improving health of the UK economy, but also by manufacturers offering attractive finance deals as they try to maintain the volume of vehicles they sell and keep their factories running. A slowdown in sales in other parts of Europe has made the UK a key market for vehicle manufacturers. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cThe new car market defied expectations in 2015, hitting an all-time record driven by strong consumer and business confidence. Buyers took advantage of attractive finance deals and low inflation to secure some of the most innovative, hi-tech and fuel efficient vehicles ever produced. \u201cThe past four years have seen a remarkable period of sustained growth, and the outlook remains positive with every reason to expect the market to hold broadly steady in 2016.\u201d Last year also saw record figures for Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, which achieved record UK sales of more than 100,000. JLR said sales in the country rose 22% to 100,787, making the UK the biggest market for the luxury carmaker. The company reported strong sales of the Jaguar XE and XF as well as the Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Evoque. The UK performance is a big boost for the carmaker as it faces a slowdown in China. Jeremy Hicks, managing director of JLR UK, said: \u201cSelling over 100,000 cars in a year is a remarkable achievement for the Jaguar Land Rover business and our retailer partners. We have our strongest, most exciting product lineup to date and a single-minded focus to get these amazing cars to more customers than ever.\u201d McLaren Automotive, the sports car division of the Formula One team, also had a record year. Worldwide car sales rose to 1,654, prompting the company to announce it is hiring 250 staff and launching a second production shift at its manufacturing complex in Woking. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, visited McLaren on Thursday. He said: \u201cMcLaren road cars are some of the most iconic in the world and that is down to the excellence of British design, engineering and manufacturing. The news that it is creating 250 new jobs is a sign that the UK auto industry continues to thrive.\u201d The Ford Fiesta remains the most popular car in Britain, with 133,434 sold in 2015. The Vauxhall Corsa is in second place, followed by the Ford Focus, Volkswagen Golf and Nissan Qashqai. Sales of petrol cars grew faster than their diesel counterparts, meaning petrol reclaimed its position as the market leader. A total of 48.8% of the new cars sold last year are fuelled by petrol, with diesel accounting for 48.5%. Alternatively fuelled cars, such as electric and hybrid models, grew 40.3% to account for 2.8% of the market. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economistof IHS, the analysis and forecasting group, said falling petrol prices could help car sales grow further in 2016, despite the record performance in 2015. \u201cThe economic fundamentals still look largely healthy for the motor industry, which will hopefully allow car sales to hold up at an elevated level over 2016,. Car sales will also likely to continue to be buoyed by attractive offers and finance packages. Furthermore, low petrol prices can only help matters,\u201d he said. \u201cOne potential concern for the car industry is that increasing uncertainties over the economic outlook could cause fleet operators to be more cautious in their purchases of new vehicles.\u201d The top-selling cars of 2015 Ford Fiesta 133,434 Vauxhall Corsa 92,077 Ford Focus 83,816 VW Golf \u00a3,409 Nissan Qashqai 60,814 VW Polo 54,900 Vauxhall Astra 52,703 Audi A3 47,653 BMW Mini 47,076 Vauxhall Mokka 45,399",

      "bodyText": "The night before New Year\u2019s Eve, Eileen Jackson spent the evening talking about one of the biggest decisions she had made in 2015: buying a home. She had gone out for drinks with one of her single male friends and ended up giving him advice on how to buy a place of his own. Jackson, who is in her thirties, is a part of a larger trend \u2013 one that Bloomberg is referring to as \u201cthe return of a single female homebuyer\u201d. The number of single women homeowners is set to increase this year, building on a growing trend, say brokers in cities like New York, Los Angeles and Boston. According to the National Association of Realtors, the number of unmarried females owning homes climbed from 13.9 million in 1994 to 17.5 million 2002. The number of women buying homes, however, slowed down after the 2008 recession. In 2009, single women made up 21% of home buyers. In 2015, they made up 15%. And the bachelors? Last year, they accounted for about 8% of the homebuyers. Jackson has wanted to buy a home for the large part of a decade. \u201cBack when the economy started to fall, I started looking around and I kept getting priced out by people with cash offers that were way above asking price. It was crazy,\u201d she said. She had kept her eye on the market, browsing listings, and had seen prices rising. However, it was a leaky roof that finally made her \u201cpull the trigger\u201d. She was renting an apartment that flooded during a rainstorm due to a shoddy roof job. After a couple nights in a hotel, Jackson realized the time to buy was now. \u201cI couldn\u2019t control what was happening because I wasn\u2019t the owner. That made me realize I really needed to buy,\u201d she said. No more fairytales Victoria Massengale, a Los Angeles-based real estate agent who helped Jackson find her new place, also bought a place of her own a few years back. \u201cWomen don\u2019t buy into fairytales anymore. They\u2019ve got their own careers, they have their own lives,\u201d she said. Many of her clients on the west coast are looking at smaller houses, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. \u201cNot so much condos, which is a little bit surprising,\u201d said Massengale. About 90% of the single female buyers go through the process with an agent or a broker, according to the National Association of Realtors. Shopping for a home \u2013 be it a condo or a house \u2013 is an intimate process. The list of buyers\u2019 wants often includes details about their relationship status: do they think they will live in their new place alone? Do they want extra closet space for a potential partner? \u201cIf this conversation doesn\u2019t reveal a client\u2019s relationship status, the financial discussion inevitably will,\u201d said Christina Christopoulos, a New York-based broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Single female buyers do not hide their independence \u2013 especially not from their broker. \u201cThey always bring up the fact that they are single women looking to buy for themselves. They seem to be very proud of this \u2013 as they should be,\u201d said Alexander Boriskin, a broker with the SLS Team at Douglas Elliman Real Estate. In the past 16 months, he has represented three single female buyers \u2013 all of whom purchased co-ops in New York City \u2013 and is working with a few others. The majority of his clients work in finance. \u201cThey are all looking for an apartment that would be able to accommodate a partner, not necessarily an extra bedroom but extra closet space for another person and an extra half bathroom is a big plus,\u201d he said. In Boston, single female buyers are the new normal Less Arnold, a real estate agent and vice-president of Compass\u2019 Boston office, also admits that while the single independent buyer is not new in Boston, there has been a recent uptick. \u201cIn the past six months, half my deals have been single female buyers and they have been anywhere from mid-20s to early 40s,\u201d said Arnold. \u201cA woman in her mid-20s saved her pennies and bought a place for she and a roommate to live in.\u201d This way, instead of paying down someone else\u2019s mortgage with monthly rent payments, she and her roommate will pay down her mortgage instead. Another of Arnold\u2019s clients is a single female university professor, who has been searching for the perfect property for about three years. Another woman in her late-20s just bought a second unit in a 60-unit building. Her first unit \u2013 a studio \u2013 is now an investment property that she plans to rent out. \u201cI am super excited that we are in an era where it\u2019s not weird that women are buying on their own. I would be surprised to hear that it\u2019s unusual,\u201d said Arnold. \u201cI hope that in terms of home-buying women continue to just do it, because obviously it\u2019s within our grasp.\u201d Arnold herself will become a first-time homeowner in 2016. \u201cThe truth is I haven\u2019t met the man and I am not interested in having kids on my own, so I have decided to move ahead with the property and hope that the rest of it will come once I get myself settled,\u201d she explained. Her future home is still undergoing renovation, but is expected to close in June. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying, which is hysterical to me because I coach people through this for a living,\u201d Arnold said, laughing. \u201cI am incredibly excited and a little bit feeling like I am over my head \u2013 typical buyer feelings. But it feels really empowering to know that I am going to have my own place in which to build my future.\u201d The properties purchased by Arnold and her clients range from $350,000 to $1.5m. Don\u2019t throw it away on rent According to the National Association of Realtors, the median income of the single female buyer is about $57,300 and the median price of the home they purchased is $169,000. In urban areas, both the incomes and the home values tend to be much higher. Since 2012, an increasing number of women earned more than $100,000 a year in Boston, according to Redfin, a residential real estate company. Los Angeles, too, saw an increase in higher-income female households. Redfin\u2019s recent survey of prospective buyers had 62% female respondents and 38% male respondents. According to Massengale, many of her clients purchase Los Angeles homes within the $1m and $1.7m range. \u201cObviously, in Los Angeles, you have to have a really nice income to be able to afford a house like that,\u201d she said. It\u2019s not impossible though. In fact, one of her single female clients purchased a property for $4.5m. Massengale works with a lot of women in the tech and film industry, including many female television writers. Owning a home is \u201cso much better than throwing it away on rent\u201d, Massengale said of investing in a home. \u201cThe hardest thing is getting the downpayment. So maybe my advice should be: don\u2019t eat as much and get a downpayment together,\u201d she added, laughing. Jackson, who works in tech as a product manager, agreed. \u201cI was thinking about renting another place but the rent has increased dramatically in Los Angeles. It used to be in the $2,000 range for a two bedroom, but now it\u2019s in the $2,000 for a one bedroom. That just seems ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I went and got qualified for a loan and found a place in like a month, put an offer and the rest is history.\u201d She put down more than 20% on her $699,000 house. On New Year\u2019s Eve, her apartment was packed away in boxes as she stood surveying her belongings. In a couple weeks, those boxes will be unpacked in her new house. \u201cI am excited to finally move in. I am so excited to get out of here, to actually move into my house,\u201d she said, laughing with joy.",

      "bodyText": "Majestic Wine\u2019s sales fizzed over Christmas as customers embraced the trend for craft beer and artisan gin at Britain\u2019s biggest wine merchant. Retail sales for the 10 weeks to 4 January at shops open a year or more were up more than 7% and total sales across the business rose 12%, Majestic said in a trading update. Sales of Curious Brew lager, Punk IPA and other niche beers increased by more than half while sales of craft gins such as Bathtub and Sipsmith London Dry jumped 144%. Majestic\u2019s retail business, which accounts for three-quarters of profit, also more than doubled sales of Provence ros\u00e9 as warmer weather changed tastes in wine. The figures mark a rapid improvement for Majestic, whose sales fell during the crucial Christmas period a year ago. The chain responded by buying fast-growing online merchant Naked Wines and installing NW\u2019s founder, Rowan Gormley, as chief executive. Gormley, who took over in April, has scrapped Majestic\u2019s complex price offers and broken with its warehouse roots by allowing customers to buy a single bottle of wine rather than a minimum of six. He is also revamping stores and overhauling computer systems to give staff more information on customer tastes. Like last year, Majestic was up against fierce competition from supermarkets using wine offers to lure Christmas shoppers. Gormley said it was too early to say the improved performance was a trend but that Majestic had made a good start. It makes almost a third of its sales over the Christmas period. Gormley said: \u201cThis is an encouraging result. I am particularly heartened to see the Majestic retail business grow as the impact of our better pricing, better service and better-looking stores start to take effect. However, there is still much to do. \u201cI take my hat off to the 1,000-plus people we have, from Aberdeen to Sydney, who worked flat out during the festive season and deserve a large glass of wine.\u201d Costs rose and margins narrowed slightly over the Christmas period as a result of his changes, Gormley said. He has indicated his plans will take three years for full effect. The company\u2019s shares rose as much as 10% and were up 8.6% to 355p in early afternoon trading. Sales at Naked Wines, which asks its members to crowdfund small winemakers, rose 29% and Majestic\u2019s sales to businesses such as restaurants and bars increased 10%. Naked sold 27,000 bottles of its first artisan gin in a week when it went on sale at the end of November. Alistair Davies, an analyst at the stockbroker Investec, wrote in a note: \u201cA pleasing retail trading performance is likely to build confidence that Majestic can deliver a sustainable recovery. Attractive growth opportunities are available to the group through commercial and Naked Wines, which represent the longer-term investment story.\u201d",

The chain responded by buying fast-growing online merchant Naked Wines and installing NW\u2019s founder, Rowan Gormley, as chief executive. </p> <p>Gormley, who took over in April, has scrapped Majestic\u2019s complex price offers and broken with its warehouse roots <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/26/majestic-wines-rowan-gormley-six-bottle-minimum\">by allowing customers to buy a single bottle of wine rather than a minimum of six</a>. He is also revamping stores and overhauling computer systems to give staff more information on customer tastes.</p> <p>Like last year, Majestic was up against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/10/waitrose-adds-a-splash-of-fine-wine-to-its-christmas-discount-list\">fierce competition from supermarkets using wine offers to lure Christmas shoppers</a>. Gormley said it was too early to say the improved performance was a trend but that Majestic had made a good start. It makes almost a third of its sales over the Christmas period.</p> <p>Gormley said: \u201cThis is an encouraging result. I am particularly heartened to see the Majestic retail business grow as the impact of our better pricing, better service and better-looking stores start to take effect. However, there is still much to do. </p> <p>\u201cI take my hat off to the 1,000-plus people we have, from Aberdeen to Sydney, who worked flat out during the festive season and deserve a large glass of wine.\u201d</p> <p>Costs rose and margins narrowed slightly over the Christmas period as a result of his changes, Gormley said. He has indicated his plans will take three years for full effect. </p> <p>The company\u2019s shares rose as much as 10% and were up 8.6% to 355p in early afternoon trading.</p> <p>Sales at Naked Wines, which asks its members to crowdfund small winemakers, rose 29% and Majestic\u2019s sales to businesses such as restaurants and bars increased 10%. Naked sold 27,000 bottles of its first artisan gin in a week when it went on sale at the end of November.</p> <p>Alistair Davies, an analyst at the stockbroker Investec, wrote in a note: \u201cA pleasing retail trading performance is likely to build confidence that Majestic can deliver a sustainable recovery. Attractive growth opportunities are available to the group through commercial and Naked Wines, which represent the longer-term investment story.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Steve Rowe, the new boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, is an M&amp;S lifer who has been with the company for more than 26 years and made his name as the head of its highly successful food division. Described as \u201ccollegiate\u201d and a people person, Rowe can nevertheless be tough when required - an approach which has earned him the nickname \u201cNails\u201d with some colleagues. Marc Bolland was closely involved in grooming Rowe, 48, as his successor - sending him off to Harvard for a global strategic management course for senior leaders last summer. With Rowe at the helm, the M&amp;S food halls have been the only bright spot at the retailer in recent years. Its main clothing division has struggled as customers have left its womenswear on the rails, leading to three years of falling profits. Rowe became the favourite internal candidate to succeed Bolland last year when he took over from John Dixon as head of M&amp;S\u2019s clothing and homewares business last July. Dixon, who had been with M&amp;S for nearly 30 years, had been viewed as the favourite to replace Bolland but he quit when it became clear that Rowe was the more likely successor. Rowe, a Millwall fan, began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store in south London, but joined Topshop as a trainee when he left school at 18. Four years later he was a store manager but defected to join M&amp;S because he thought it offered a better career path \u2013 following in his father\u2019s footsteps, who was a director of M&amp;S until 2000. Rowe has worked across the company in store management, menswear and furniture and held a number of senior positions including director of retail and e-commerce. He joined the board in 2012 when he became head of the food division. Despite fierce competition from rivals ranging from Waitrose to Aldi and Lidl, Rowe kept the food division growing for 25 consecutive quarters on a like-for-like basis. He bagged the biggest bonus paid to M&amp;S executives last year after the retailer posted its first profits rise in four years.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The price of North Sea oil has fallen to just above $32 per barrel, 72% lower than the peak of $115 reached in the summer of 2014. The value of Brent crude was hit for the fourth day in a row, this time by figures from the US showing oil production had risen even higher despite the enormous supply glut. Turmoil in the Chinese stock markets over fears of lower local economic growth also unnerved oil traders. China is the world\u2019s second-largest user of oil and has driven most of the past growth in demand. Prof Paul Stevens, an expert in petroleum economics at Chatham House, the foreign policy thinktank, said the value of oil may need to fall to $20 before some producers cut back and reduce supply. \u201cStorage is pretty much full and people are already talking about buying tankers as floating storage,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cBut if supply continues to outstrip demand, then the only one thing you can do with the oil is sell it.\u201d The current slump in crude prices is a boost to British motorists as it led to a fall in the cost of petrol. Some gas contracts are also tied to oil prices so there is also downward pressure on the cost of gas used for heating and generating electrcity. But low prices are disastrous for the North Sea offshore oil industry, which needs higher costs to compete for investment against much lower cost-producing regions such as the Middle East. Thousands of jobs have been lost in Aberdeen since the slump began in July 2014. At the heart of the current turmoil is a decision by Saudi Arabia and other leading voices in the Opec oil cartel to get drawn into a turf war with the new generation of US shale producers. By keeping output targets high, the Saudis hope to drive the US shale drillers out of business. But the latest figures released last night by the US Department of Energy showed production rising by 17,000 barrels a day over the past seven days, the fourth consecutive week of increases. Prices of Brent on the global market sank to $32.16 before recovering slightly to $33.57, still 2% down on the day.",

      "bodyText": "Poundland has become the latest victim of the switch to online shopping in the run-up to Christmas, warning that profits for the year will be at the lower end of expectations. Shares in the discount retailer fell by more than 12% amid concerns that the strong growth enjoyed by Poundland and other discounters during the recession may be over. The shares are now changing hands at 167p \u2013 compared with their float price of 300p less than two years ago, and 60% off their 419p peak in February last year. Retailers have warned that trading in the run-up to Christmas was hurt by warmer than average weather and declining footfall on the high street as more consumers shopped online instead. Analysts estimated that sales at Poundland\u2019s established stores had fallen by around 3% in the 13 weeks to 27 December as the company revealed a 29.4% year-on-year rise in total sales over the period. Just over 21 percentage points of the total sales growth came from the addition of 99p Stores, which Poundland bought for \u00a355m last year. Another three percentage points was from the 99p Stores converted to Poundland stores. Jim McCarthy, chief executive of Poundland, said that trading had been \u201cvolatile\u201d in the Christmas run-up. He blamed the rising popularity of online shopping, unseasonably mild weather and fears of terrorism after the Paris attacks for a slide in the number of shoppers out and about. \u201cIf we were in glorious isolation [the sales figures] would be more concerning. Management were disappointed with the outcome of Christmas and our third financial quarter as we were very well set up with good strong ranges and value, but shopping venue footfall was down.\u201d The company \u2013 which is also opening 70 more stores this year \u2013 said that pre-tax profits for the year to March would now be towards the bottom end of market expectations, which was for pre-tax profits excluding the costs of acquiring 99p Stores and expansion into Spain of between \u00a339m-\u00a346m. Poundland recorded underlying pre-tax profits of \u00a344m last year. McCarthy said Poundland would have to adapt to a dramatic change in festive shopping habits in which families search the internet and leave their gift-buying very late in the hope of bagging more bargains. The company is to step up investment in its own online operation and will test out a \u201cmulti-price\u201d chain in six of its larger stores from April. McCarthy said Poundland, which already operates the multi-price Dealz chain in Ireland and Spain, would test the idea in the UK for about three months before deciding whether to open further outlets. He suggested there were as many as 50 larger stores where the new idea could work and the same products might also be introduced into the main Poundland chain and online as special deals. But McCarthy insisted he had not lost faith in the single-price Poundland format. \u201cOur confidence in selling products at a pound remains absolutely intact and all our research shows that customers love that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at Asda and Lidl they are deep discounters and are continuing to grow, then you\u2019ve got Primark, TK Maxx and ourselves. The discount sector is here to stay. There will be winners and losers and we expect to see some [takeovers] but the consumer will be choosing value from everybody and it is our job to provide them with an easy choice.\u201d Andrew Hall, consultant at Conlumino, warned that there might be too many discount retailers in the UK. He said: \u201cPoundland continues to expand its physical presence at breakneck rate with ongoing conversions of 99p Store formats and new Poundland stores taking the store portfolio to an impressive 628 in the UK. \u201cThe ongoing proliferation of discount formats, including Poundland, may not be considered a viable long-term strategy given a well saturated market, reliance on physical formats and unpredictability of footfall over the financial year.\u201d",

Rowe \u2013 whose father was a director of M&amp;S until 2000 \u2013 will take over on 2 April, the end of M&amp;S\u2019s financial yearBolland will then stay on to support Rowe for two months but continue to be paid until 7 January 2017. He will be handed \u00a3868,000 in basic pay, benefits and pension payments for the eight months after he steps down in June and nearly \u00a3656,000 in shares to add to the \u00a33m stake in M&amp;S he already owns. Bolland could also be in line for an annual bonus of up to \u00a31.95m in cash and shares this year and more than \u00a31.5m in long-term share awards based on performance conditions and his length of service. The change at the top was revealed as M&amp;S said sales of clothing and homeware at established stores had plunged by 5.8% over the past three months. It blamed unseasonal weather and availability problems for the \u201cdisappointing\u201d trading. The latest decline comes on top of a 5.8% fall in the same three months of 2014 and was worse than the 5.5% decline expected by the most pessimistic City analysts. The retailer has recorded only one quarterly increase in clothing sales in the past five years, as it has lost out to rivals including Next, Zara and Primark. However, M&amp;S chairman, Robert Swannell, insisted there had been no pressure from shareholders for Bolland to go. Bolland said he had always planned to stay no more than six years in the job and informed the board last summer that he intended to leave in 2016. \u201cI find that is healthy for a chief executive in a big business,\u201d he said. He said as chief executive of a major company the job was never finished but he had done the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d. This, he said, included improving the distribution infrastructure and IT that supports M&amp;S\u2019s shops, reviving the food business, bringing the online operation in-house from Amazon and improving the quality of the chain\u2019s clothing. He said he was leaving behind a \u201cfinancially healthy and talented company\u201d. Bolland admitted he was disappointed that he had been unable to deliver a rise in clothing sales over Christmas but he said: \u201cThe business is better in style, quality and margin as never before. You will see over the next quarters the benefits of that and if that is after my time I don\u2019t mind.\u201d \u201cIs [the job] finished here? No \u2026 Can I look back and say it is all finished and great? Never. But I have done the heavy lifting that was needed,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very pleased with what I have done over the last years and think I have built the foundations.\u201d The Dutchman said he planned to stay in the UK and wanted to mix roles on the boards of large companies, such as his non-executive position at Coca-Cola, with roles where he could \u201cgive back\u201d, such as giving more time to his work with charity Unicef, where he is vice-president. He likened himself to an ageing footballer moving from the pitch to a coaching role. Swannell said M&amp;S had spent two years working with consultants on assessing and developing internal candidates to replace Bolland. He would not say if any outsiders had been interviewed for the job. M&amp;S shares fell 1% when the stock exchange opened but soon turned positive, trading 0.6% higher, as traders digested the news of Bolland\u2019s departure. While the clothing sales performance was worse than expected, M&amp;S said it had protected profit margins by refusing to join in the heavy discounting on the high streets before Christmas. As a result the company said gross margins on clothing and homewares would be at the top of expectations. Food sales were also better than expected in the last quarter, up 0.4% in the 13 weeks to 26 December, as the retailer recorded its best ever Christmas. Analysts had forecast no growth, but the improvement was a stark contrast to the 1.4% decline revealed by Waitrose on Wednesday. Food sales at M&amp;S have risen for 25 consecutive quarters on a like-for-like basis. Bolland said: \u201cM&amp;S had an excellent Christmas in food, delivering record Christmas sales and strongly outperforming the market. \u201d The retailer blamed its poor clothing sales on the unusually mild weather which put shoppers off buying winter fashions. It also said that it had not stocked enough light coats and other items suitable for the milder weather and had suffered as competitors slashed prices. Analysts welcomed the appointment of the highly experienced Rowe but were disappointed by the numbers. Veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman said the clothing sales figures were \u201cdreadful,\u201d adding \u201cit is clear that further ground has been lost\u201d. He said Rowe had a \u201cunifying, collegiate approach\u201d and was a \u201cwelcome change\u201d. \u201cHe is an old school, down to earth, merchant,\u201d said Hyman. But he added: \u201cHe inherits a damaged fashion brand in the toughest market we have ever seen.\u201d Rowe will be paid a salary of \u00a3810,000, less than Bolland\u2019s last disclosed salary of \u00a3975,000 for 2014-15. The new CEO will receive the same variable financial incentives as his predecessor but all other terms, including his pension allowance, remain unchanged. Clive Black at Shore Capital described Bolland as \u201c a distinguished commercial statesman\u201d, who had done a lot of work behind the shopfronts to modernise the M&amp;S business.",

      "bodyText": "China halted the day\u2019s trading within 30 minutes of opening on Thursday morning as shares plunged by more than 7% \u2013 triggering an automatic \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d \u2013 and authorities accelerated the devaluation of the Chinese yuan. China\u2019s recently installed \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism paused trading for 15 minutes after the CSI300 index fell 5% in the first 13 minutes of trading. On resumption of trading it fell further, triggering the day\u2019s halt. The CSI300 index finished down 7.2%, the SSE composite index fell 7.3% and Shenzhen dropped by 8.3%. Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC business school, said he expected more government action to halt the stock market drops, \u201cwhether it is changing the circuit breakers, whether it is again intervening in the market, whether it is extending the ban on large selling by institutions.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if they let this continue going down. By almost any measure, the Chinese stock market is pretty over valued and so you would be looking at a pretty significant fall to get back to a reasonable valuation. I would be surprised if they allowed it to move back to more appropriate levels.\u201d \u201c2016 in China is getting off on the wrong foot.\u201d On Thursday Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index, which continued to trade, hit its lowest point since July 2013, down by more than 3%. It was the second time this week that the circuit breaker device, intended to bring stability to the markets, has been deployed. The stock market turbulence brought back recent memories of when China suffered a humiliating bout of financial chaos that saw the future of the prime minister, Li Keqiang, called into question. China surprised markets on Thursday by speeding up the devaluation of the yuan to its lowest level in nearly five years. That unexpected move sent currencies across the region tumbling, as investors feared the Asian giant was kicking off a virtual trade war against its competitors. The People\u2019s Bank of China set the official midpoint rate on the currency at 6.5646 yuan per dollar, the lowest since March 2011. That was 0.5% weaker than the day before and the biggest daily drop since August 2015, when an abrupt near 2% devaluation of the currency also roiled markets. \u201cPeople are definitely nervous. People are paying a lot of attention to this stuff, whether it is the stock market or the changing currency,\u201d said Balding. \u201cI think psychologically the currency issue is a bigger issue for Chinese and it is definitely a bigger issue for a lot of firms. Between the two issues there is a lot of worry right now.\u201d The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, swiftly fell half a US cent. A sustained depreciation in the yuan puts pressure on other Asian countries to devalue their currencies to stay competitive with China\u2019s massive export machine. It also makes commodities denominated in US dollars more expensive for Chinese buyers, which could hurt demand and thus further depress commodity prices. \u201cIt appears at least initially that the Chinese government is telling the market that they are going to steer the RMB [yuan] closer and they are not going to intervene in the stock market,\u201d said Balding. \u201cBut they have done this before when they don\u2019t exactly rush to maintain it and they don\u2019t tell people that everything is going to be OK and the market craters for a couple of days and then they step in. So whether or not this maintains through even tomorrow, who really knows?\u201d Patrick Chovanec, a China expert and the chief strategist at New York\u2019s Silvercrest Asset Management, said the latest bout of stock market turbulence was the 2015 crisis continuing to play out. \u201cTo me this isn\u2019t what about is happening now in China, it is really a correction that should have happened last summer and they didn\u2019t let it happen. It has just been postponed.\u201d \u201cThe first time [this week] it went down 7%, people pointed to the PMI [Purchasing Mangers Index] number. This time they are pointing to the currency fix. All it takes is a catalyst. When you\u2019ve got a market where the median value is 65 times earnings and they are trying to prop it up like that something is going to come unglued.\u201d On China\u2019s unexpected devaluation of the yuan, Chovanec said: \u201cIt seems like they don\u2019t really quite know what they are doing. They had these sudden moves, they said back in the summer that they were not going to devalue, that this was all really about preparing for SDR [special drawing rights] status in the IMF. They seem to have lost control of the narrative when it comes to what their plan is and what their policy is towards the exchange rate.\u201d Angus Nicholson, a Melbourne-based analyst for IG, said China\u2019s currency intervention had \u201creally shocked markets\u201d by hinting that the country\u2019s economy was in far poorer shape than Beijing has admitted. He said: \u201cWhat it has really fuelled is a concern that perhaps the economic situation in China is actually far worse than many had assumed and is easily perceived from the public released economic statistics. The People\u2019s Bank of China and other senior financial and economic institutions have access to greater insights as to how the economy is tracking.\u201d \u201cIf they are easing the currency at such a dramatic rate and such a rapid pace that really does heighten concerns about how the economy is actually tracking and that perhaps things are going far worse than many had expected.\u201d",

This time they are pointing to the currency fix. All it takes is a catalyst. When you\u2019ve got a market where the median value is 65 times earnings and they are trying to prop it up like that something is going to come unglued.\u201d</p> <p>On China\u2019s unexpected devaluation of the yuan, Chovanec said: \u201cIt seems like they don\u2019t really quite know what they are doing. They had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/14/china-halts-yuan-devaluation-with-slight-official-rise-against-us-dollar\">these sudden moves</a>, they said back in the summer that they were not going to devalue, that this was all really about preparing for <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/1886827/chinese-yuans-entry-imfs-special-drawing-rights-basket-usher\">SDR [special drawing rights] status</a> in the IMF. They seem to have lost control of the narrative when it comes to what their plan is and what their policy is towards the exchange rate.\u201d</p> <p>Angus Nicholson, a Melbourne-based analyst for IG, said China\u2019s currency intervention had \u201creally shocked markets\u201d by hinting that the country\u2019s economy was in far poorer shape than Beijing has admitted.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhat it has really fuelled is a concern that perhaps the economic situation in China is actually far worse than many had assumed and is easily perceived from the public released economic statistics. The People\u2019s Bank of China and other senior financial and economic institutions have access to greater insights as to how the economy is tracking.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIf they are easing the currency at such a dramatic rate and such a rapid pace that really does heighten concerns about how the economy is actually tracking and that perhaps things are going far worse than many had expected.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Manufacturing exports slumped at the end of last year, and will continue to suffer in 2016, leaving Britain with a two tier economy that relies on consumer spending to drive growth, a leading business group has warned. The British Chambers of Commerce said a survey of 7,500 firms found that manufacturing fared worse than the services sector and was \u201cclose to stagnation\u201d after domestic and export sales fell to below their pre-recession levels in 2007. The BCC said that without government action to improve workers\u2019 skills, upgrade outdated infrastructure, and allow small firms access to the same cheap credit available to major businesses, \u201cthe UK economy could suffer negative consequences in the face of increasing global uncertainty\u201d. The finding \u2013 which echoes official figures showing a contraction in factory output at the end of last year \u2013 came after analysts said the impact of government spending cuts, jittery world markets and the prospect of an EU referendum vote had dragged down expectations of UK services growth this year. The services sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of economic activity and ranges from shops and hotels to banking, maintained its solid growth in the run-up to Christmas, but the Markit/Cips survey found that expectations for business activity over the next 12 months were the weakest for almost three years. The UK services business activity index, a single-figure measure tracking the health of service companies, fell slightly in December to 55.5, from 55.9 in November. It remained just above the long-run survey trend level of 55.2, with a reading above 50 indicating expansion and below contraction. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the sector had put in a solid performance and provided enough impetus to make it likely that GDP growth was 0.5% in the last quarter of the year, slightly above the 0.4% registered for the third quarter. But he warned that \u201ca rosy outlook\u201d was not guaranteed, saying: \u201cWith business expectations about future workloads dropping to the lowest for almost three years, firms are becoming more cautious in the face of growing uncertainties. The cost impact of the living wage, government spending cuts, a potential hike in interest rates, global economic growth jitters and, of course, Brexit are all weighing on business minds and pose significant downside risks to economic growth in 2016. \u201cThe pace of hiring has already slowed accordingly as firms scale back expansion plans in what might be seen as a warning shot to those taking a complacent view of economic prospects for the coming year.\u201d The BCC called on the Bank of England to keep interest rates low to protect small and medium-sized businesses from higher borrowing costs. It has also called on ministers to help firms get access to finance to support investment. The survey found that export sales declined in the last quarter by nine points to +1%, the lowest level since Q3 2009, while export orders also fell to +1%. The balance of services firms that said orders increased or dropped also fell, though by only three points to +15% - the lowest level since 2011. David Kern, the BCC\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cWhile we must not forget the strengths of the UK economy \u2013 with higher growth than in most G7 economies and with a dynamic and flexible labour market \u2013 the recovery is still fragile. Given the global uncertainties, it is important to avoid unnecessary risks. Though wage pressures are rising, inflation is likely to remain below target over the next 18 months, and the MPC [the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee] should keep interest rates at their current low levels for the time being.\u201d",
