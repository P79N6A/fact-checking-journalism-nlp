      "bodyText": "The employment minister, Priti Patel, was part of a team of spin doctors paid hundreds of thousands of pounds to help a tobacco giant counter negative publicity, including that surrounding its joint venture with one of the world\u2019s most brutal military regimes. Documents unearthed by the Observer shine new light on Patel\u2019s work for Shandwick, a lobbying and PR firm that worked for British American Tobacco (BAT) in the early years of this century. The documents, released by BAT following a legal action, show that Patel was one of seven employees used by Shandwick on the account. One of her jobs was to lobby MEPs against the introduction of the EU tobacco control directive, which was introduced shortly after the new millennium. She was charged with ensuring that a letter from the BAT chairman at the time, Martin Broughton, outlining his objection to the directive, was faxed to every MEP. But internal BAT documents show that in addition to her work lobbying MEPs, Patel\u2019s team played a key role in fashioning the company\u2019s public profile. In a memo dated 14 December 2000, a senior executive within the company, Andreas Vecchiet, conducted an annual appraisal of the Shandwick team\u2019s performance. \u201cWe have mainly used Shandwick for project-based work relating to the WHO [World Health Organisation] campaign, NGO monitoring \u2026 reputation issues relating to Burma, and some limited advice relating to Nigeria and labour standards.\u201d BAT\u2019s position in Burma at the turn of the millennium was hugely controversial. \u201cBAT\u2019s factory in Burma was jointly owned with the military dictatorship and so helped fund one of the most brutal military dictatorships in the world,\u201d said Anna Roberts, executive director at Burma Campaign UK. \u201cBAT refused to admit how much money it gave to the dictatorship, but Burma Campaign UK estimated that BAT paid the generals $16m (\u00a310m) in taxes alone between 1999 and 2002. In contrast, BAT paid its factory workers in Burma just \u00a315 a month. The dictatorship spent 40% of its budget on the military.\u201d Following widespread public outrage, BAT pulled out of Burma in 2003. The tobacco giant also came under fire in Nigeria after children as young as seven were found to be working on farms supplying it with tobacco leaf. BAT insists it has always been opposed to the use of child labour. It has taken extensive steps to ensure that child labour is not used in the production of its cigarettes, in particular the use of random inspections. However, some labour organisations have expressed concerns that the practice is continuing. Despite Shandwick\u2019s efforts, BAT was not impressed with the team\u2019s performance, notably on its work regarding Burma. \u201cThe main issues we have are lack of timeliness and responsiveness,\u201d Vecchiet notes. \u201cWe find the accuracy of information from basic raw material is often lacking.\u201d He adds: \u201cOn work we commission \u2013 such as on Burma \u2026 they have had to be sent back to be overhauled, made more comprehensive and sophisticated.\u201d It appears that many within the Shandwick team were opposed to working for \u201cbig tobacco\u201d. \u201cVirtually since day one we have felt a sense that Shandwick does not actually feel comfortable or happy working for BAT,\u201d Vecchiet complains. He mentions a request from one Shandwick employee for BAT not to refer to Shandwick as its PR agency in a magazine article. But he notes that \u201cPriti [and another employee] seem quite relaxed working with us\u201d. Patel was 27 when she joined Shandwick and it is not clear whether she still defends her former employer\u2019s work for BAT. She worked for Shandwick for three years and was a junior employee who had no control over the BAT account, which was a significant earner for her employer. The documents show that in 2001, Shandwick drew up plans to invoice BAT for 279 hours of its work a month, of which Patel\u2019s contribution amounted to 100 hours. BAT was charged \u00a3165 an hour for Patel\u2019s services. The entire team was on a monthly retainer of nearly \u00a340,000 \u2013 a total of almost \u00a3500,000 a year. The Observer has repeatedly asked Patel for comment, but she has declined to do so and in the past has referred the matter to a law firm. Patel is seen as on the right of the Conservative party, having backed calls for the return of capital punishment and voted against same-sex marriage. She is also seen as a serious force in the party.",

      "bodyText": "Despite Ryanair\u2019s image makeover as a caring carrier, passengers remain anxious in the queue to board the airline\u2019s 0940 flight from Gatwick to Dublin. Mainly, though, that\u2019s because the gate display is describing it erroneously as an easyJet flight to Berlin. But there is a difference from the Ryanair queues of old: no jostling for the best seat, and a noticeable array of odd-shaped cases, second bags, shopping and oversized soft toys being carried aboard. One man is clutching a 2ft-long cardboard tube as well as his case. \u201cI\u2019m best man at a wedding tomorrow and it\u2019s for the speech,\u201d says Colm Donnelly, 26. \u201cI\u2019m still a bit worried about getting it on. But I\u2019m much more likely to chance my arm with something like that on Ryanair now.\u201d The Irish airline relaxed its famously tight rules and punitive charges last year, as part of a plan to turn its woeful image around: to stop, in chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s words, \u201cunnecessarily pissing people off\u201d. Allocated seating ended the scramble at the gate. Permitting a second carry-on bag, and giving more flexibility for frontline staff to tolerate minor infringements, also followed. Ryanair wanted to signal it had changed, to make it easier for people to book and fly. Last week, it appeared to see the fruit of those changes: a spectacular, 66% leap in profits to \u20ac867m (\u00a3623m) in the first full year since its conversion from the uncompromising stance of old. O\u2019Leary said the transformation, dubbed the Always Getting Better programme, had attracted millions of new customers. But has being nice really driven profits, or has the hard cash been won elsewhere? Tales of Ryanair woes past fall readily from the lips of passengers on the London-Dublin flight, with regulars noting the difference in the bag policy above all. Crew seem friendlier, says Danielle Smyth, a yoga instructor: \u201cMaybe before they were a bit uptight as they had to enforce those rules. It was just so restrictive \u2013 I remember once when something didn\u2019t quite fit, I was told I couldn\u2019t bring it on: I managed to fit it between three other people\u2019s cases but it was a bit of a panic.\u201d Others weren\u2019t so lucky: last time Sharon Watchorn, a project manager from Guernsey, flew this route with Ryanair, she recalls: \u201cI had a wheelie case a millimetre too long; they put it in the hold and charged me an extortionate amount.\u201d Julia Wright, from Suffolk, on her first Ryanair flight for some years, had noticed the changes to the website: \u201cIt\u2019s better than it was, booking online. Previously, they added so many things the price went right up.\u201d Few, though, seem to have been ultimately swayed one way or the other by the niceness \u2013 perhaps confirming O\u2019Leary\u2019s longer-standing view that the customer service that mattered was cheap fares and punctual services. On board, the plane is still a riot of yellow plastic, and crew still flog scratchcards, although the well-thumbed menus and inflight magazines have been deemed too tatty to remain. Our 737 touches the tarmac almost 10 minutes after its scheduled arrival time for the short hop to Dublin \u2013 a delay that doesn\u2019t stop the sounding of the notorious on-time arrival bugle, now wrapped in a marketing jingle in a new sanitised form, like Cameron instead of Thatcher. Donnelly disembarks safely with case and oversized tube, and no penalty to pay. If the main difference so far is purely the absence of stress, a dramatic manifestation of change is evident at Ryanair\u2019s new HQ, on a business park a few miles from the airport. It is a building that O\u2019Leary snapped up after the crash left a surfeit of unwanted property and it has the kind of features you\u2019d expect to see in Silicon Valley rather than at a notoriously parsimonious airline. On a day when O\u2019Leary and other Ryanair execs are on the road to trumpet their financial results to investors, there is not a suit to be seen, and few faces over 40. However, there are some Ryanair veterans present, including Ray Conway, the airline\u2019s chief pilot, who has been with the carrier since its inception as a two-plane operation. Underneath the makeover, he says, Ryanair operates on straightforward principles. It still only flies one type of plane, the Boeing 737, and while the jet has become more technologically advanced it has not required an expensive investment in retraining pilots. That cuts costs, while making maintenance schedules and rostering simpler. And, tellingly, he is proud that statistics from Stansted show Ryanair pilots consistently make the most fuel-efficient descent of any airline operating from the Essex airport. And while customers have been cut a little slack with their carry-on, and Ryanair has spent more on proper marketing after moving away from its previous technique of getting O\u2019Leary in a leprechaun hat or generating preposterous headlines, the focus on cost remains. More passengers now occupy each plane: where an average of one in six seats was empty in 2014, the results for 2014-15 show it is down to one in eight, and the target for 2015-16 is one in 10, well ahead of the industry average. Costs overall, excluding fuel, have stayed steady even as total revenue leapt 12% to \u20ac5.65bn. And the big difference in cost has been the oil price. The price of jet fuel has now risen from its cheapest point after the spectacular falls in late 2014; but airlines buy ahead and the effects filter through slowly. Ryanair\u2019s hedging meant only 10% of its fuel requirement in 2014-15 was bought at current prices. Even that reduced costs by 5%. And, with perfect symmetry, its profit margin increased by five percentage points this year. For a decade from 2000, the fate of airlines\u2019 profits had an inverse correlation with the fuel price as rising oil costs savaged the bottom line. Since 2010, fuel-efficient planes and effective hedging have helped the industry decouple the oil price from profits. Ryanair\u2019s hedging of fuel and currency costs, allowing it to purchase planes and oil until 2018 with dollars bought at a rate that looks cheap, should help it to even bigger profits ahead. Whether Ryanair remains nice or not, the shareholders will probably be smiling. AIRLINE LOUNGE: THE NEW HQ A slide from the office floor to reception. A putting green in a foyer. Air hockey and pool tables. Not only has Michael O\u2019Leary embraced Twitter, but he has festooned Ryanair\u2019s \u20ac18m (\u00a313m) head office with accoutrements better associated with a Silicon Valley tech headquarters. Or possibly a nursery. Office space may not have been at a premium in Ireland since the crash, and Ryanair\u2019s offices are in an estate outside Dublin and the airport. But it is a startling sight: games, decorations and imaginative meeting spaces abound. Whole walls are given over to huge photographs of football teams, cartoon characters, landscapes and racehorses (O\u2019Leary\u2019s own office preference). O\u2019Leary and the other directors occupy glass-walled rooms around the multicoloured open-plan desks where most of the 500 or so staff work. Only the operations room, tracking all 1,600 daily flights on a giant screen, is the big reminder that this is an airline\u2019s headquarters; well, that and the yellow toy biplane in which employees can relax. The Californian touches don\u2019t just speak to the new sunny Ryanair, but also its digital ambitions, since it is home to Ryanair Labs, the tech department that has overhauled its website and may yet change the business more fundamentally. Add in the sight of a customer service department on live chat solving queries and problems, and Ryanair\u2019s world seems impossibly changed. Fortunately for traditionalists, who remember O\u2019Leary telling staff to nick other people\u2019s ballpoint pens, the stationery cupboard remains firmly locked.",

Ryanair\u2019s hedging of fuel and currency costs, allowing it to purchase planes and oil until 2018 with dollars bought at a rate that looks cheap, should help it to even bigger profits ahead. Whether Ryanair remains nice or not, the shareholders will probably be smiling.</p> <h2>AIRLINE LOUNGE: THE NEW HQ</h2> <p>A slide from the office floor to reception. A putting green in a foyer. Air hockey and pool tables. Not only has Michael O\u2019Leary embraced Twitter, but he has festooned Ryanair\u2019s \u20ac18m (\u00a313m) head office with accoutrements better associated with a Silicon Valley tech headquarters. Or possibly a&#xa0;nursery.</p> <p>Office space may not have been at a premium in Ireland since the crash, and Ryanair\u2019s offices are in an estate outside Dublin and the airport. But it is a startling sight: games, decorations and imaginative meeting spaces abound. Whole walls are given over to huge photographs of football teams, cartoon characters, landscapes and racehorses (O\u2019Leary\u2019s own office preference).</p> <p>O\u2019Leary and the other directors occupy glass-walled rooms around the multicoloured open-plan desks where most of the 500 or so staff work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d2d9d13b9d17eea9cc761cbf9c8b2fc8b61ac16\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432922612486/e23497ae-1c94-4992-8821-97eee8287403-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The indoor putting green at Ryanair's HQ.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The indoor putting green at Ryanair\u2019s HQ.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gwyn Topham for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only the operations room, tracking all 1,600 daily flights on a giant screen, is the big reminder that this is an airline\u2019s headquarters; well, that and the yellow toy biplane in which employees&#xa0;can relax.</p> <p>The Californian touches don\u2019t just speak to the new sunny Ryanair, but also its digital ambitions, since it is home to Ryanair Labs, the tech department that has overhauled its website and may yet change the business more fundamentally.</p> <p>Add in the sight of a customer service department on live chat solving queries and problems, and Ryanair\u2019s world seems impossibly changed. Fortunately for traditionalists, who remember O\u2019Leary telling staff to nick other people\u2019s ballpoint pens, the stationery cupboard remains firmly locked.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sick of the boss? Weary of instruction? As many as 300 US companies are embracing holacracy, a self-managing philosophy some say can make businesses more resilient, innovative and better attuned to customer needs. But this month Amazon-owned online shoe retailer Zappos.com, a leading proponent of no-boss, non-hierarchical governance, was rocked by a mass employee defection. Almost 210 of its 1,500 employees took redundancy rather than relinquish familiar titles or positions and adapt to a holacratic system of \u201ccircles\u201d in which employees decide for themselves how to do their job, aka \u201cenergising a role\u201d. The defections have not discouraged Zappos chief executive Tony Hsieh from adopting a system designed to replace human-imposed, top-down hierarchies with flattened-out holarchies. In a 4,700-word letter to employees, Hsieh said he believed that the holacratic system empowered employees \u201cto act more like entrepreneurs\u201d. But America\u2019s business community remains unconvinced: is Zappos \u2013 a billion-dollar company \u2013 being reorganised into a kind of progressive kindergarten that will ultimately implode, or is it taking a bold step into the future of self-management under an extensive code of governance and practices? The company is known for its quirks. Obsessed with customer satisfaction \u2013 motto \u201cDeliver WOW Through Service\u201d \u2013 it calls its executives \u201cmonkeys\u201d, and greets visitors to its Las Vegas headquarters with cowbells. Self-organising or self-managing organisations are not new. Examples include WL Gore, maker of GoreTex, which employs 10,000 people, and Morning Star, a tomato processor. But in 2007 a 28-year-old company CEO Brian Robertson, came up with and trademarked the concept of holacracy and wrote its 15,000-word \u201cconstitution\u201d. His book, Holacracy: The Revolutionary Management System that Abolishes Hierarchy, is published this week. According to Harvard Business School professor Ethan Bernstein, who has led several studies of self-organising organisations, the philosophy is not to erase hierarchies entirely but to allow companies to form hierarchies organically and to make domains over which people have more fluid authority. \u201cWe want Zappos to function more like a city and less like a top-down bureaucratic organisation,\u201d Hsieh told the journal Quartz. He says that cities become more productive as they grow; companies less. \u201cLook at companies that existed 50 years ago in the Fortune 500 \u2013 most don\u2019t exist today. Companies tend to die, cities don\u2019t.\u201d But business commentators are divided over Hsieh\u2019s experiment. Forbes calls it \u201cgurus gone wild\u201d; the Wall Street Journal, \u201cconfusion\u201d. But surveys suggest the relationship between manager and employee is already changing, with companies giving workers more autonomy in an effort to limit unproductive management hierarchies. The modern company, offers Forbes magazine, is more of a conversation than a mandate. \u201cWe all want organisations to make us more capable of being productive, but many of us feel our organisations make us less capable and we could potentially do things better individually than we could as a team,\u201d Bernstein explains. \u201cThat requires a restructuring process, not structure, so the problem we\u2019re trying to solve is to create organisations that are supportive of restructuring processes.\u201d A key tenet of holacracy is explicitness. If employees have a problem, they can announce a \u201ctension\u201d. In a manager-less, environment such as Zappos, all roles, responsibilities and policies are stored in a software system called GlassFrog. The idea is to adapt companies from an era in which many employees performed repetitive tasks to the modern era of companies run by relatively few people that can quickly acquire stratospheric valuations. Three decades ago, a billion-dollar organisation would have had hundreds of thousands of employees, says Bernstein; when WhatsApp was bought by Facebook for $19bn last year, it had around 60 employees. \u201cThis is part of a greater change in the way we conceive of organisations, and in the different way we organise for scale and move toward more knowledge or technology work with less need for larger numbers of human beings doing coordinated and repetitive tasks over time.\u201d But does the organisation without structure simply cease to be an organisation? Bernstein says holacracy is good at conflict resolution but doesn\u2019t solve issues of career progression, compensation, hiring and firing \u2013 traditional components of a bureaucracy. \u201cIf you reduce structure, you have to raise another part. Holacracy raises the process aspect of it.\u201d And that means as many as five hours extra a week, according to Zappos employees. Hsieh says it will take three to five years to fully implement holacratic values. It is, he says, \u201ca process of trial and error\u201d. HOLACRATIC OATH \u25a0 The philosophy of holacracy is enshrined in a 15,000-word \u201cconstitution\u201d. Employees are assigned a circle and roles within it are assigned, elected, or formed into further sub-circles. A job is not a job but an \u201cenergiser of roles\u201d. \u25a0 Stripping bosses of their titles is the first step. Then comes the more difficult task of distributing leadership into each role. As the Wall Street Journal noted: when everyone\u2019s in charge, there probably will be lots of meetings. \u25a0 The end goal is radical transparency \u2013 there\u2019s no hiding behind titles or bureaucracy. As Tony Hsieh says: \u201cIt\u2019s not the fastest or the strongest that survive. It\u2019s the ones most adaptive to change.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 June 2015.
