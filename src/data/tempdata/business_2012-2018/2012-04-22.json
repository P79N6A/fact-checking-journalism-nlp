Alarmed at the swirling rumours about who will take control at Threadneedle Street from June next year, the chancellor will advertise the job and interview a shortlist of candidates before making an announcement towards the end of the year.

Osborne is keen to show his backing for King at a time when the economy is still struggling to recover from its worst recession since the second world war and the bank is taking on new responsibilities for financial supervision.

Treasury sources said it would be the first time that the post had been advertised, but said it was unlikely that a list of \"runners and riders\" would be published before the appointment is officially made by the Queen. Osborne's team stressed that they were determined to avoid the \"total shambles\" when the last Labour government was contemplating whether to reappoint King for a second term in 2008. Relations between King and the then chancellor, Alistair Darling, deteriorated badly during the first year of the global financial crisis.

A detailed list of savings published by the Treasury shows that the biggest single item is a \u00a3700m cut in the estimated \u00a34.1bn cost of the planned Thames tideway tunnel, a scheme to improve London's sewers. The cost reduction has come from removing the so-called \"optimism bias\" in the original estimates for the project \u2013 a sum factored into the plans to take account of Whitehall's belief of cost overruns in the original budget. Other examples include the joint procurement by LU and Crossrail of escalators and the joint planning of 14 road programmes by the Highways Agency.

      "bodyText": "Those who watched Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund a year ago say he played a blinder. Although he was to leave Washington under a cloud shortly afterwards, DSK impressed with his no-nonsense approach to his fellow Europeans. The IMF's managing director asked Jean-Claude Trichet, then president of the European Central Bank (ECB), and Christine Lagarde, at the time France's finance minister, who they thought they were kidding when they insisted there was no problem in the eurozone. The case put by Trichet and Lagarde was that the single currency as a whole had low levels of debt, had no current account deficit in aggregate and was not contributing to the imbalances in the global economy. Strauss-Kahn told them to face up to the fact that the single currency was being eaten away by the sovereign debt crisis. A year on and not much has changed. Lagarde is now doing DSK's old job at the IMF and perhaps has a better understanding of what he was on about. The fund has rattled the tin for contributions to a bigger firewall to cope with future crises, and has got some but not all of its members to stump up. Greece has had a second bailout and the decisive action by the ECB prevented a whole raft of eurozone banks from going belly up at the end of last year. As in the spring of 2011, the Europeans arrived in Washington for the half-yearly meeting of the IMF professing that all was well, and that the benefits of structural reforms would eventually become apparent in the members of the eurozone that needed to improve their competitiveness. Be patient, they said. Few were convinced by this flannel. Indeed, there was not an awful lot of sympathy for the Europeans, particularly from the emerging world, which wondered why poor countries should be asked to contribute to a bailout fund for the world's richest continent, particularly since they were simultaneously being told that the eurozone's problems were behind it. Many also remember the hard line taken by the Europeans during the sovereign debt crises of the 1990s. Yet there was concern as well as irritation. The global economy is still moving forward painfully slowly, and there is a risk that contagion spreading from the eurozone could again halt this process. The upward pressure on Spanish bond yields in recent weeks illustrates deep and lingering concerns about Europe's problems. It was quite a shock for the markets last week to discover just how dependent Spanish banks were on the ECB for funding, and there is justifiable anxiety about the fragility that would be exposed by a fresh and highly probable fall in Spanish property prices. What markets are looking for is a convincing story about how countries such as Italy and Spain, let alone Greece and Portugal, dig themselves out of the mess they are in. They have yet to get one. Traditionally, the sort of structural adjustment programmes imposed by the IMF involve a big currency devaluation to make a country's exports cheaper. Because this also makes imports dearer, the package also includes domestic austerity to prevent the benefits of increased competitiveness being frittered away through higher inflation. This remedy \u2013 the one that was used in the 1990s for Mexico and during the Asian crisis of 1997-98 \u2013 is not available for countries inside the eurozone. But if devaluation is ruled out, so sadly are all the other possible cures: fiscal transfers or a willingness by Germany and the other rich countries of northern Europe to accept higher inflation than those in the south. Instead, Greece, Portugal and Ireland are being forced to grind out improvements in competitiveness through austerity and structural reforms alone. This will take many years, and in the meantime slashing wages and pensions is killing the domestic economy. This matters because markets are worried about rising levels of national debt as a proportion of national output. If national output goes down because of permanent recession, the debt-to-GDP ratio worsens and countries end up chasing their tails. This is the sort of conundrum that would no doubt have tickled Lewis Carroll. Markets take fright at high budget deficits and rising debt levels and demand severe belt-tightening. When the belt-tightening has the desired effects, markets demand to know where the growth is going to come from. There was not the remotest suggestion in Washington last week that anybody knows how to solve this conundrum. Lagarde talked airily about developing \"more and better Europe\" but lacked a convincing explanation for how this would come about. The IMF supports common eurobonds that would take the pressure off the weaker nations, and would like money to be channelled directly into eurozone banks from Europe's bailout fund, rather than the money needing to go to sovereign states first. Both ideas are strongly resisted by the Germans. The danger, therefore, is that the time bought by the ECB's emergency action is wasted. The economic data from Italy and Spain over the coming quarters is almost certain to be abysmal, and pressure from the financial markets is likely to intensify despite the fact that both the eurozone and the IMF now have bigger firewalls. Both Lagarde and George Osborne noted last week that the firewalls on their own will not be sufficient to end the crisis. The comparison with three years ago when the newly created G20 met in London could hardly be starker. At that time, there was collective action to ease both monetary and fiscal policy to prevent a second Great Depression. That mood of unity quickly dissipated, however. As a tentative recovery began, countries started to go their own way, fears about the debts incurred in the fight against recession surfaced and orthodox thinking returned. The G20 is now a shadow of what it was designed to be \u2013 it is both toothless and divided. The only sign of collective action is in Europe, obsessed as it is with austerity. There is no sign of a credible and coherent plan to boost employment and growth, and thus no compelling narrative for the markets. In the end, the expectation is that Germany's commitment to the European project will prove so unbreakable that it will swallow its doubts about fiscal transfers, eurobonds and direct lending to troubled banks. Eventually, Germany may be forced to become the equivalent of an IMF for Europe, providing the money for bailouts in return for structural change. For this to occur, though, there will need to be a real threat that the single currency will break up. The crisis would have to get worse through a combination of stupidity and complacency. As things stand, that is precisely what is going to happen.",

      "body": "<p>Ralph Turvey, who has died aged 84, was an economist with many careers. One of these was at the London School of Economics, where he studied and became a lecturer and then, in 1951, reader in economics, and to which he returned belatedly as a visiting professor. The others were at the Treasury (1960-62) and a great variety of public and private enterprises and institutions, notably the Electricity Council (1964-67) and the National Board for Prices and Incomes (1967-71).</p> <p>In the immediate postwar period, Ralph was regarded as the most brilliant LSE undergraduate. When I arrived there as a student not many years later, he was already a legend, not least because of his final examination papers. Each of his answers was set out on less than one side of a sheet of paper. Richard Sayers, the professor of money and banking, told me that the examiners did not see how they could possibly award him a first. It then dawned on them that his answers were, in fact, perfect.</p> <p>Ralph was born in Birmingham and educated at Sidcot school, Somerset. After graduating from the LSE, he spent some time at Uppsala University, where he became fluent in Swedish and deeply appreciative of the Stockholm school of Gunnar Myrdal, Bertil Ohlin, Erik Lindahl and Erik Lundberg. Ralph returned home, and immediately joined the staff at the LSE. He became one of the favourites of the departmental head Lionel Robbins, the other being William Baumol, who was then a graduate student. Some years later, Baumol published the book Economic Dynamics, to which Ralph contributed a superb chapter derived from his Swedish experience.</p> <p>Ralph received rapid promotion and became reader in economics at a young age. I was taught by him in my final year, and can remember his ability to formulate the most abstruse problems, and then solve them. Ralph was not a serious mathematician but had an astonishing facility for logical analysis.</p> <p>While he was still nominally at the LSE, Ralph took up an opportunity to go to the Treasury. He was as good in macroeconomics as in micro, but his work helping officials was chiefly in the latter area. This was because fiscal and monetary policy was the preserve of a select group who fought hard and successfully to keep it that way. He concentrated on the correct approach to costs as they affected decision-making. This involved the concept of \"opportunity costs\", ie what you give up to do something, which is not necessarily cash. The civil servants found this very hard to understand. Even more difficult was his attempt to explain investment decision-making based on discounted cash flow, using an interest rate because future costs and benefits were worth less now than nominally equal current ones. When I replaced him at the Treasury in 1962, Ralph told me \"there is no difference between teaching undergraduates and civil servants, except that the latter set the examination paper\".</p> <p>Ralph's list of publications was long. As a result of his experience in the electricity industry, he published his definitive work, Optimal Pricing and Investment in Electricity Supply (1968). He argued in favour of the long-run marginal cost pricing rule when a public enterprise sold its output within the public sector. By marginal cost is meant the increase in the costs of an enterprise when it adds marginally to its output. Ralph argued that the economy's performance would be best if the focus was on the long run when all necessary adjustments can be made. Somewhat surprisingly, he appeared to reject the generally accepted theory of \"second best\" enunciated by Richard Lipsey and Kelvin Lancaster when he also made the case for selling to the private sector at prices proportional to long-run marginal cost. His contribution continues to have relevance when it comes to regulating pricing policy and actual prices in, for example, the energy and transport industries although they are now in the private sector.</p> <p>The general conclusion of his book Economic Analysis and Public Enterprise (1971) is that privatisation does not cause pricing problems to disappear.
