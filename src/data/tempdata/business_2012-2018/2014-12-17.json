Monday\u2019s midnight rate hike from 10.5% to 17% was a panic measure that, on its own, was never going to be enough to halt the decline of the rouble. Now come the reinforcements: a vow to recapitalise the banking system; modest selling of foreign reserves; and some fancy footwork on the accounting front to allow lenders to hide a few losses. Cue an afternoon rally for the rouble. It\u2019s a plan, which is something Russia did not have on Tuesday, when the handwringing and muttering about \u201creally bad choices\u201d was making the rouble a one-way downwards bet. Is it a good plan, though? Two parts are clearly sensible: pump capital into the banking system and rule out capital controls. That\u2019s the best way to maintain the credibility of the banks and limit withdrawals by panicked depositors. The rest of it, though, is simply unclear. Suspending normal accounting rules invites the suspicion that the banks are being used as a backdoor mechanism for refinancing stricken oil giants, such as Rosneft, which have dollar-denominated debts. In the long-run, that will not inspire confidence in the banking system. As for deploying foreign reserves, at some point the market will want to know if Moscow is serious; Wednesday\u2019s $7bn (\u00a34.5bn) intervention was peanuts. The hard truth is that Moscow is a hostage to the oil price and the international sanctions that prevent the likes of Rosneft accessing international capital. There was relief on the oil front on Wednesday as the price of Brent rebounded 5% in the afternoon to $63. If $70, then $80, follows, the air of a crisis might ease a little. Sanctions, though, are another matter. Only a retreat from eastern Ukraine can make that problem go away. In the meantime, interest rates remain at 17%, which will ruin the economy if sustained for long, and the rouble has merely returned to where it stood on Monday morning. \u201cWe are working seriously on stopping this bacchanalia on the currency market,\u201d said one of President Putin\u2019s advisers. It was a nice line for domestic consumption. Unfortunately, the financial markets are not intoxicated. They are making a cold assessment that Russia\u2019s economy can\u2019t cope with $60 oil plus sanctions. This crisis is just developing. Sell-off spin \u201cIt is another step in reducing our national debt and in getting taxpayers\u2019 money back,\u201d claimed George Osborne as he unveiled plans to sell more of the state\u2019s shares in Lloyds Banking Group. Spare us the spin, please, chancellor. Flogging \u00a33bn-worth of Lloyds shares will barely be noticed in terms of the national debt. The official forecasts, minted only a fortnight ago and unveiled in the autumn statement, require borrowing (which is added to the national debt) of \u00a375.9bn next year. If the figure now turns out to be \u00a372.9bn, that\u2019s a slight improvement, but hardly cause for celebration. The timing on the announcement \u2013 during a mid-afternoon appearance at the Treasury select committee \u2013 was also odd. As for \u201cgetting taxpayers\u2019 money back\u201d, yes, it\u2019s true that the government will not sell below the state\u2019s purchase price of 73.6p, versus Wednesday\u2019s closing market price of 75.3p. But Lloyds, with its horrible HBOS inheritance, was saved for the nation in 2008 and hasn\u2019t paid a dividend since. A negligible return on investment over six years is not a triumph. Just be straightforward about it: recapitalising the banks was done to save the economy. Beyond the spin, the actual plan for shedding Lloyds shares looks perfectly reasonable. Instead of a placing with City institutions, which is how \u00a37bn-worth has been sold to date, shares will be dribbled into the market over the next six months. That\u2019s how the US Treasury does it and, all being well, the technique may deliver a slightly better sale price for the state. So good marks for market practice; zero for the over-blown boasts. Quarta masters Roberto Quarta has for a while been chairing two FTSE 100 companies \u2013 Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare group, and IMI, the engineer. So in a sense it\u2019s no big deal that he\u2019s departing IMI and plans to take on the chairmanship of advertising titan WPP instead. But IMI and WPP are hardly alike. The former is worth \u00a34bn and will slip out of the FTSE 100 on Friday, almost unnoticed. The latter is valued at \u00a317bn and tends to find itself in regular quarrels with its shareholders, especially when chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s pay comes under the microscope every year. WPP is a bigger job \u2013 much bigger. Does Quarta have the time to chair both WPP and Smith &amp; Nephew, a \u00a310bn company, as well as being a partner at private equity giant Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice? Well, he obviously believes he does, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have taken the post. And, note, there is not an iron rule that says one person can\u2019t chair two FTSE 100 companies at the same time. It\u2019s only when one of the companies is a bank that outsiders tend to be sniffy (as Sir John Peace, chairman of Standard Chartered and Burberry, knows). All the same, Quarta, after waxing about how it is \u201ca great honour\u201d to join WPP\u2019s board, should have done the polite thing: explained to his new shareholders, and Smith &amp; Nephew\u2019s, how he\u2019ll find the hours.",

      "body": "<p>Many US businesses could find themselves without terrorism insurance in the new year and there are fears big sporting events like the Super Bowl could be cancelled after the Senate failed to extend a government programme that backstops insurers\u2019 losses from terrorist attacks.</p> <p>The Senate had been widely expected to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (Tria), introduced in 2002 when insurers were reluctant to sell coverage for New York office buildings following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p> <p>It has been renewed twice, in 2005 and 2007, but expires on 31 December.</p> <p>This means insurers can cancel terrorism cover from 1 January, and many are expected to do so as they fear insolvency in the event of a big terrorist attack with no government back-up.</p> <p>The renewal was blocked on Tuesday night after opposition to a Senate vote from retiring senator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma.</p> <p>The House of Representatives had already passed the extension, which has strong support across the Senate.</p> <p>The act means the government must step in if terrorism-related losses reach a certain level across the industry in any one year.</p> <p>For the current bill, which now cannot be voted on again until the Senate returns in January from recess, that trigger point was increased to $200m from $100m, with government support capped at $100bn.</p> <p>\u201cThe industry is pretty stunned,\u201d said Sean McGovern, director of risk management and general counsel at Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market.</p> <p>He testified on Tria before the US House committee on financial services last year. \u201cThere are likely to be lots of businesses and real estate owners who will find themselves with little or no coverage for terrorism attacks.\u201d</p> <p>He said this could \u201cact as a brake on economic development. It may hamper the willingness of builders to build and lenders to lend. It\u2019s going to make people more anxious about the consequences of a terrorist attack.\u201d</p> <p>Democratic senator Chuck Schumer warned \u201cbillions of dollars of projects and hundreds of thousands of jobs are at risk.\u201d</p> <p>After paying out $35bn related to the 9/11 attacks in what was at the time the costliest year ever, most insurers excluded terrorism from commercial policies. As a result, big construction projects were put on hold across the US.</p> <p>When the Senate returns in early January, it will be controlled by the Republicans.

      "bodyText": "Many US businesses could find themselves without terrorism insurance in the new year and there are fears big sporting events like the Super Bowl could be cancelled after the Senate failed to extend a government programme that backstops insurers\u2019 losses from terrorist attacks. The Senate had been widely expected to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (Tria), introduced in 2002 when insurers were reluctant to sell coverage for New York office buildings following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It has been renewed twice, in 2005 and 2007, but expires on 31 December. This means insurers can cancel terrorism cover from 1 January, and many are expected to do so as they fear insolvency in the event of a big terrorist attack with no government back-up. The renewal was blocked on Tuesday night after opposition to a Senate vote from retiring senator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma. The House of Representatives had already passed the extension, which has strong support across the Senate. The act means the government must step in if terrorism-related losses reach a certain level across the industry in any one year. For the current bill, which now cannot be voted on again until the Senate returns in January from recess, that trigger point was increased to $200m from $100m, with government support capped at $100bn. \u201cThe industry is pretty stunned,\u201d said Sean McGovern, director of risk management and general counsel at Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market. He testified on Tria before the US House committee on financial services last year. \u201cThere are likely to be lots of businesses and real estate owners who will find themselves with little or no coverage for terrorism attacks.\u201d He said this could \u201cact as a brake on economic development. It may hamper the willingness of builders to build and lenders to lend. It\u2019s going to make people more anxious about the consequences of a terrorist attack.\u201d Democratic senator Chuck Schumer warned \u201cbillions of dollars of projects and hundreds of thousands of jobs are at risk.\u201d After paying out $35bn related to the 9/11 attacks in what was at the time the costliest year ever, most insurers excluded terrorism from commercial policies. As a result, big construction projects were put on hold across the US. When the Senate returns in early January, it will be controlled by the Republicans. In a best case scenario, McGovern said, it could pass the bill within the first week but it could take months if opposition grows. He noted that it had taken 18 months of debate to get to this point. Coburn, a longtime sceptic of Tria, said his objection was to a separate provision that was tagged on to the extension bill, to set up a regulatory body to supervise insurance agents and brokers. He argued states should be able to opt out.

    "webTitle": "Rouble surges as Moscow fights back against financial crisis - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If yesterday was Black Tuesday, then today was Russia\u2019s Fightback Wednesday. We\u2019ve seen a classic three-pronged attack from Moscow today, as policymakers get to grips with the country\u2019s currency crisis and attempt to rebuild some much needed confidence in its financial system. First, at 7am London time, the finance ministry announced it would intervene in the FX markets by throwing $7bn in reserves at the ailing rouble. At lunchtime in Moscow, prime minister Dmitry Medvedev tried some verbal intervention. He urged calm and promising that Russia\u2019s reserves were deep enough to ride out the crisis. But it was the third prong that really spurred the rouble; the Central Bank\u2019s announcement of various measures to restore stability. Crucially, this includes the promise that banks could be recapitalised in 2014, and a pledge to make more liquidity available if needed. Some of these measures look rather dubious, such as allowing banks to ignore losses or used a more favourable rouble rate. But in times of crisis, central banks play by their own rules. And the rouble has responded, surging around 12% today to around 60 to the $1 tonight. Now, this does NOT means that Russia\u2019s crisis is over, at all. The country is still heading into recession, confidence has been badly hit by the events of recent days, interest rates are punishingly high (17%), and the economy is still being stricken by sanctions. Indeed, data released this afternoon showed there was no meaningful growth in November, while capital expenditure by companies shrank by almost 5%. That\u2019s before this week\u2019s turmoil. Liza Ermolenko, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London, said: \u201cIn general the picture is still of an economy that is stagnating rather than collapsing.\u201d And who knows how the rouble will fare tomorrow?.... There\u2019s an awful lot of pressure on president Putin tonight, as he puts the finishing touches to his annual press conference tomorrow. Here\u2019s tonight\u2019s news story on the crisis: Rouble rise prompts hopes that Russian economic crisis is easing And that\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading, and for all the comments. GW Back to Russia...and this photo from Facebook appears to show a banner outside the St Petersberg stock exchange, blaming president Putin for the rouble crisis (that\u2019s the new rouble symbol) Right, the scores from Athens are in. And the government only managed to get 160 MPs to support it, against a target of 200. That\u2019s not a great result for prime minister Samaras -- he now has to persuade another 20 MPs to back him by the third and final vote on the 29th (when the target falls to 180), or face early elections. It\u2019s reviving memories of the worst of the eurozone crisis. That was fast.... Other in Athens, Greek MPs have begun voting on whether to appoint Stavros Dimas as their next president. Dimas is expected to fall short of the two-thirds majority needed. That\u2019s not game over, though; two more ballots can be held, and in the end a three-fifths majority - 180 votes - will do. But even that may be beyond the government, which only has a majority of 155. More market excitement, which will cheer Moscow; the oil price has just surged by over 4% in the last few minutes. Wow. The Rouble just fell back below the 59-to-the-dollar mark as the rally continues. Masha Lipman, an independent political analyst in Moscow, says tomorrow\u2019s press conference is \u201ca moment of truth\u201d for Vladimir Putin. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer possible to go on in the same fashion. The economy is tumbling. The time has come for a definitive choice, doing nothing won\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d (via Bloomberg) It\u2019s been a truly tumultuous few days for the Russian currency, as this chart shows. The rouble began Monday morning at a record low of 58 to the dollar, but weakened to 66/$1 by the end of the day. That triggered the overnight rate hike from the Bank of Russia, to which the markets blew a raspberry on Tuesday, driving the rouble up to 80/$1, before subsiding back to around the 68 mark. This afternoon\u2019s 10% surge is the biggest one-day rally since 1998, according to the FT. But it still leaves the rouble weaker than at the start of the week. Could the tide be turning for the rouble? John Higgins of Capital Economics reckons it might. He cites several reasons why the Russian currency could clamber back off the mat: First, the price of oil could recover. Second, the authorities have made it harder to short the currency by raising interest rates sharply (even though this will come at a cost to the economy). Third, they still have plenty of ammunition in the way of reserves. And fourth, they could continue to take steps to support the currency in other ways if required. We\u2019ve already seen fresh steps this afternoon, of course, from the Central Bank, which have given the rouble quite a lift. Russia\u2019s situation remains perilous, though, Higgins adds: Nonetheless, the devastating consequences that the current oil price will have on Russia\u2019s economy and its dollar-debt laden financial system suggest calm may not be fully restored anytime soon. Here\u2019s Shaun\u2019s latest dispatch from Moscow, explaining how Russia is poised for the president\u2019s annual press conference, tomorrow: Rouble halts fall but remains volatile as Russia awaits Vladimir Putin speech Amid the mayhem in Russia, French actor Gerard Depardieu has been launching his new luxury watch. The timepieces, under the slogan \u201cProud to be Russian\u201d have been made by Swiss manufacturer Cystos. Our Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker attended the event, and reports that Depardieu was a little late (!), and shrugged off the rouble crisis. The FT flags up that Russian banks are also being allowed to charge more for loans, under the relief measures just announced. From January 7th, interest rate caps on consumer loans would be temporarily abolished to allow banks and microfinance institutions to reflect their full cost of lending. The rouble continues to recover, and is now changing hands at \u2018just\u2019 60 to the dollar. A remarkable recovery from yesterday, when it briefly hit the 80 mark. The Russian stock market is on an absolute tear this afternoon since the central bank made its announcement. The RTS index has surged by 17%. Financial experts aren\u2019t impressed that Russian banks will be allowed to ignore losses on their assets (if only temporarily): Russian central bank First Deputy governor, Ksenia Yudayeva, says some of these new measures are designed to stabilise the rouble on the foreign exchange market. Reuters has the details: In an emailed statement, Yudayeva said in order to ease concerns over approaching debt payments by Russian companies, the bank would provide additional foreign currency funds. \u201cThese measures are intended to balance supply and demand on the foreign exchange market, which will help stabilise the rouble rate more quickly.\u201d Confirmation that the rouble is rallying: BIG NEWS FROM MOSCOW: The Russian Central Bank has just announced a series of measures to \u201cmaintain the stability of the Russian financial sector\u201d. The news has sent the rouble surging on the foreign exchanges. The CBR says it is preparing to pump more money into its banks next year. It is also relaxing some banking standards, to effectively allow banks to temporarily ignore losses caused by the currency crisis, and use a more favourable rouble exchange rate. It\u2019s an attempt to ease the crisis that is gripping Russia, and spooking the global markets. The rouble is rallying hard, up 10% to 61.8 to the dollar as I type. The details are here, in Russian. The key measures include: A pledge to recapitalise credit institutions next year, in partnership with the Government of the Russian Federation. Banks will, temporarily, be freed from having to recognise losses on their securities portfolios, to \u201creduce the sensitivity of market participants to market risk\u201d. The CBR will offer banks more opportunities to buy foreign exchange funds through auctions run by the bank. Banks will be allowed to, temporarily, use the rouble exchange rate of the previous quarter when assessing the value of their assets. The CBR will offer more support to the Moscow Stock Exchange, to help it distribute liquidity through the markets. Reaction to follow.... The clock is ticking over at IKEA\u201ds store on the outskirts of Moscow. The Swedish furniture giant has said it will raise Russian prices on Thursday, in response to the slump in the rouble\u2019s value. Associated Press reckons that there are \u201cweekend-like crowds\u201d at the store this afternoon. I\u2019ve dug out some pictures: A Russian businessman has warned that the country is facing a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of sanctions and tumbling oil revenues. Marat Atnashev, a former vice-president of the TNK-BP oil group, told Sky News that simply correcting the exchange rate of the rouble will not fix the Russian economy, as \u201cThere is a full scale economic crisis ahead that will affect all of us.\u201d The slump in the rouble this year has already forced up the cost of repaying loans in foreign currencies, Atnashev pointed out. Atnashev also warned that all parts of Russia\u2019s economy - ordinary people, businesses, the elite, will lose something in this crisis, adding: [Moscow] needs to find the fiscal answer, the economic answer but also the political and social answer\u2026.to deliver an economy that is sustainable. Back to Russia.....and the prime minister\u2019s office has said that Dmitry Medvedev called on Russia\u2019s top exporters on Wednesday to behave \u201cresponsibly\u201d during the crisis. Medvedev urged them to manage their foreign currency revenues in a way that would not boost rouble volatility, during today\u2019s meeting. Exporters already convert a portion of their export revenues into roubles. Over to America briefly... and US inflation has fallen this month as the weak oil price cuts the cost of gasoline. Consumer prices declined by 0.3% month-on-month, the biggest decline since December 2008 (when the financial crisis was raging). That pulls the annual US inflation rate down to 1.3%. Something for the Federal Reserve to ponder at their meeting today.... We\u2019ve pulled together a gallery showing how Russians have been racing to the shops since the currency crisis started: Rouble collapse triggers Russian spending spree \u2013 in pictures Russia\u2019s prime minister has attempted to calm the situation by assuring the population that Moscow has the resources to overcome the crisis. Dmitry Medvedev gave the message at today\u2019s televised cabinet meeting with ministers and top industry leaders, saying: \u201cAll the economic and production goals that you have set yourselves, the country has the currency resources to achieve them.\u201d Medvedev\u2019s words appeared designed to prevent panic on the streets, by pledging that Moscow would get things under control. \u201cIt\u2019s in our joint interests to bring order to the currency market as quickly as possible.\u201d \u201cNo one - neither our citizens nor banks nor the real economy - needs such instability.\u201d And he also claimed that \u201cemotions\u201d had helped to drive yesterday\u2019s market rout, which saw the rouble hit record lows of 80 to the US dollar. As flagged up earlier, Medvedev also appears to have ruled out implementing capital controls, to Russians taking money of the bank, or out of the country. He said: \u201cWe act on the basis that our future actions must be based on market mechanisms, \u201cThere is no point in bringing in the extremely harsh regulation in this sphere that there was at one time. It doesn\u2019t lead to anything useful\u201d. And the message does appear to be working.... the rouble is strengthening to around 65.8 to the dollar, from 68 earlier. But that\u2019s still close to a record low. Here\u2019s the word on the streets of Moscow today: Some citizens blame their own government for the crisis, others blame the West. Time for a catch-up, I think. Russia remains gripped by a currency crisis that threatens to pull the country\u2019s economy deep into recession and could trigger wider economic damage. The situation in the financial markets is looking a little more stable than yesterday. But Russians are being hurt by the recent slump in the rouble, which has forced Apple to shut its Russian online store. Apple closes Russian website because of rouble crisis The Moscow finance ministry made a dramatic bid to help the rouble this morning, announcing that it will deploy $7bn of foreign exchange funds to bolster the currency. Full story. This sparked an early rally, but some of the bounceback has somewhat fizzled out. This leaves Russia\u2019s currency hovering around 67 roubles to the US dollar, and 82 to the euro. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst at Caxton FX, compared the finance ministry\u2019s move to \u201cputting a plaster on the wall of a dam that is about to burst\u201d. The underlying economic strength of Russia\u2019s economy is still in grave doubt as oil prices slide yet again to a new low of $55 per barrel.\u201d And analyst Timothy Ash has dismissed the move as rummaging down the sofa for some spare change. Russia\u2019s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, is held meeting with cabinet ministers and top CEOs today to discuss the crisis (see photo above) Medvedev tried to talk up the currency, and appeared to rule out introducing capital controls. He said: \u201cEveryone recognises that the rouble is undervalued. It has become detached from fundamentals and does not reflect the state of the economy,\u201d \u201cThere is no point in introducing extremely strict regulation of this area, such as there has been in previous periods. That does not help anyone.\u201d The Kremlin has been blaming yesterday\u2019s currency turmoil on recklessness and manipulation; one adviser said the \u201cbacchanalia\u201d in the foreign exchange markets must end. The crisis continues to dominate the worlds of finance and politics. A European official in Brussels has admitted that \u201cWe are all watching the economic developments in Russia with concern\u201d The main European stock markets are all down today - the FTSE 100 has lost 48 points, or 0.75%, to 6283. The Moscow stock market is rallying, though, pushing the RTS index up by around 6%. The situation on the streets also appears calm, as Russians face the prospect of sharply rising prices on imported goods. Many Russians have been flocking to stores to buy imported goods before prices are hiked. And currency firms remain open for business, although foreign currency prices are pretty steep. Analysts are speculating that Russia may, eventually, be forced to implement capital controls to stabilise its currency. Simon Kruse, Moscow correspondent at Danish newspaper Berlingske, reports that prices are changing fast in Moscow as retailers try to keep up. Timothy Ash, an analyst at Standard Bank, is astonished by the news that the Russian finance ministry will deploy around $7bn of \u2018spare\u2019 currency reserves to prop up the rouble (as explained earlier) Ash says the intervention is \u201cunbelievable stuff\u201d: \u201cWhy, if the central bank has $413bn in reserves, is the ministry of finance being called on to put its hand in its pocket for some small change \u2014 they are like checking the back of the sofas at this stage\u201d. The slump in the rouble has astonished Ash: \u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever seen any currency go through such extreme gyrations in all my time in the industry. The rouble is fast becoming untradable \u2014 maybe that is what the central bank wants.\u201d (via the FT) Russia\u2019s currency exchange firms are open again today. They\u2019ll buy and sell euros and dollars, but the spread between the prices is painfully wide. One Moscow office will buy a dollar for 61 roubles, but will insist on 76 roubles in return for selling one (compared to this morning\u2019s spot price of 68/$1). The Russian crisis will be high on the agenda when European leaders meet for their final summit of 2014 on Thursday. Officials in Brussels are watching the crisis in Russia with growing alarm. Speaking off the record to Reuters, an EC official said: \u201cWe are all watching the economic developments in Russia with concern....No one has an interest in Russia falling into a deep depression.\u201d Quotes from prime minister Medvedev are flashing up, via the Interfax agency 10:21: RUSSIAN PM MEDVEDEV SAYS ROUBLE OUT OF ZONE COMFORTABLE FOR ECONOMY, SITUATION SHOULD BE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL - INTERFAX 10:22: MEDVEDEV SAYS TOUGH REGULATION OF CURRENCY MARKET NOT NEEDED, ACTIONS SHOULD BE BASED ON MARKET MECHANISMS - INTERFAX You can\u2019t accuse Russia\u2019s politicians of sitting on their hands during this crisis. Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev will hold a meeting of his cabinet today, which will also be attended by the heads of two top energy firms, Rosneft and Gazprom, and the CEOs of major exporters. Central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina is also attending. That\u2019s via the RIA Novosti news agency. A Kremlin economic aide has told local media that the Russian government and the central bank agreed to take \u201cconsolidated actions\u201d, at a meeting yesterday chaired by Dmitry Medvedev. No further details were given. The aide, Andrei Belousov, apparently added that Moscow was determined to a halt to the \u201cbacchanalia\u201d in the foreign exchange markets. It\u2019s s reference to the Roman festivals of Bacchus - known for their boozy, riotous and generally ribald nature. Not exactly how I\u2019d describe yesterday\u2019s turmoil in the foreign exchange markets..... Russia\u2019s fightback continues.... Vladimir Chistyukhin, a deputy governor of the central bank, has said an investigation into possible manipulation on the foreign currency market has been launched. Chistyukhina also told reporters in Moscow that the CRB is not discussing introducing a mechanism to suspend trading on the foreign currency market if there were sharp moves in the exchange rate. Back to Russia. The rouble is bobbing around at 68 to the $1 after this morning\u2019s rally fizzles out, and analysts are speculating that Moscow may have to introduce capital controls. Heinz R\u00fcttimann, emerging market Strategist at Julius Baer, says restrictions on money flow would be \u201cthe last shoe to drop\u201d, if other measures to shore up the currency fail. It all depends on the next couple of days and the USD/RUB exchange rate. At risk are funds that invest in the local market and would be hindered to transfer money out of the country.\u201d If the rouble does not stabilise, R\u00fcttimann argues, then the Russian central bank would face two choices \u2013 either hike interest rates again, or restrict the flow of capital in Russia: \u201cCapital controls are clearly the least preferred option as any investment flows will come to a halt and Russia\u2019s in-vestment-grade rating would be at risk. Capital controls would penalise all foreign investors with exposure to Russia through funds (equities and bonds) that invest in the local market. With capital controls, those funds could not redeem investors\u2019 money so easily anymore. London-listed Russian stocks, however, would still be tradable. The Egyptian experience has shown that investors\u2019 money could be blocked between one to three months.\u201d The Russian government has insisted that capital controls, which were deployed in Cyprus in 2013 to prevent bank runs, are not being considered. Two pieces of UK news, quickly. 1) The UK unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.0% in the three months to October, dashing hopes of a fall to 5.9%. The unemployment total fell by another 63,000 during the quarter, to 1.958m. Average earnings are more encouraging \u2013 up by 1.4% in the quarter (or 1.6% if you strip out bonuses). That\u2019s higher than CPI inflation, meaning real wages rose (a little). 2) The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee was, again, split 7-2 over interest rates this month. Minutes of this month\u2019s meeting show that the seven doves were unwilling to raise borrowing costs until wages are growing..... Two news stories are being hammered out as I type.... That didn\u2019t last long. The rouble is weakening again, heading back towards the 68/$1 mark where it began the day. Moscow\u2019s foray into the foreign exchange markets an hour ago (details) appears to be fading.... Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019s story on the Russian government\u2019s move into the foreign exchange markets this morning: Rouble strengthens as finance ministry starts selling FX The Russian rouble strengthened sharply on Wednesday in volatile trade after the Finance Ministry said it had started selling foreign currency from its leftover stock. The Russian currency has come under heavy selling pressure this week, forcing the central bank to hike its key interest rate by an unexpected 650 basis points, in an emergency move that did little to buttress the currency. At 0825 GMT, the rouble was up around 3% against the dollar at 65.52 and was 4.2% stronger versus the euro at 81.50. Despite Wednesday\u2019s modest recovery, the rouble was still down almost 50 percent against the dollar this year, stirring memories of the 1998 crisis when the currency collapsed within a matter of days. That poses a major challenge for President Vladimir Putin whose popularity, based partly on providing stability and prosperity, is at risk from the rouble\u2019s decline, which is damaging Russia\u2019s credibility among investors. Market participants also said exporters could be selling dollars with an eye on the upcoming tax period. A currency dealer at a large Russian bank said, however, that central bank interventions could not be excluded. \u201cThe strengthening of the rouble looks artificial, so it could be the central bank, though I wouldn\u2019t give you a 100 percent guarantee. This could be an errant exporter, whom authorities have \u2018convinced\u2019 to sell forex.\u201d Russia\u2019s central bank has conducted over $80bn in forex market interventions this year to defend the rouble, which has been dragged lower by falling oil prices, Western sanctions over Ukraine and an increasing sense of market panic. The bank on Wednesday said it had conducted $1.961 billion worth of forex market interventions on Dec. 15 Russia\u2019s top trade union leader, Mikhail Shmakov, has warned that the slump in the value of the rouble is hurting Russians badly. The weak currency will drive up the price of imported goods, while the massive interest rate hike \u2013 from 10.5% to 17% \u2013 is going to make credit even more expensive. Lets put today\u2019s rouble rally (up around 3% today) into some context. It\u2019s still down around 65% over the last three months, as the tumbling oil price and tougher sanctions over Ukraine have hit Russia hard. According to Reuters, the Russian finance ministry has around $7bn of spare FX reserves in its \u2018leftover stocks\u2019, which are now being used to support the rouble. Maxim Oreshkin, who runs the ministry\u2019s long-term strategic planning department, says the \u201cmarket situation\u201d will determine how much is deployed. $7bn isn\u2019t enough firepower, on its own, to hold back the tide. But this is only a small part of Moscow\u2019s overall reserves, which are thought to exceed $420bn. Newsflash from Russia: The finance ministry has announced that it is starting to sell foreign exchanges reserves, and that the rouble is \u201chighly undervalued\u201d. That means it will be swapping currencies such as the dollar in return for roubles. And that\u2019s giving the rouble a lift. It has now \u2018recovered\u2019 to around 64.6 to the $1, a gain of around 5% today. REUTERS: RUSSIAN ROUBLE STRENGTHENING SHARPLY AFTER MINFIN SAYS STARTS SELLING FX European stock markets have (as forecast) fallen in early trading, reversing yesterday\u2019s gains. The FTSE 100 dropped 90 points at the open, before settling down 64 points at 6288, a drop of around 1%. The German DAX, French CAC and Italian MIB all fell around 1.3%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says traders are worrying about the market turmoil in Russia, the weak oil price, tonight\u2019s meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the looming Greek election. The slump in the rouble has sent Russians racing to stock up on imported goods, before retailers catch up and hike prices. And Apple has suspended sales from its Web store, after watching the rouble fall almost 20% at one stage yesterday. Bloomberg explains: \u201cOur online store in Russia is currently unavailable while we review pricing,\u201d Alan Hely, a spokesman for the Cupertino, California-based company, wrote in an e-mail today. \u201cWe apologize to customers for any inconvenience.\u201d The rouble is volatile this morning, after yesterday\u2019s tumultuous swings. Russia\u2019s currency fell by around 5% when trading began at 7am GMT, hitting 72.5 roubles to the US dollar. But in very choppy trade, it has now dipped back to around 67 against the $1. That\u2019s a very slight recovery, and it still leaves the rouble perilously weak. It\u2019s likely to be another volatile day.... Russia is the main story on the financial TV this morning too: And in research notes from the likes of High Frequency Economics (HFE): European stock markets are expected to drop this morning, as the Russian crisis and tonight\u2019s Greek presidential vote worry traders. Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets, explains: Having avoided contagion from oil and emerging markets in the previous session, things now appear to be catching up to European markets that look weak heading towards the open on Wednesday before data that could confirm the Eurozone fell into deflation during November. Multiple major money-centre banks appear to no longer be pricing USD/RUB because of the crashing ruble, cutting Russian companies and individuals off from global financing. As a major trading partner, Russia\u2019s funding problems are expected to start hitting home in Europe. Equity market calls FTSE 100 is expected to open 68 points lower at 6,263 DAX is expected to open 121 points lower at 9,442 CAC 40 is expected to open 68 points lower at 4,025 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial market, the world economy, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s no let-up from the news today. We\u2019ll be tracking: Russia\u2019s currency crisis, as the tumbling rouble threatens to trigger a major financial crisis. The latest UK unemployment figures, due at 9.30am GMT. They could show another fall in the jobless rate, from 6% to 5.9%. The data could also show wages picking up, in a pre-election boost for the government. The minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting, two weeks ago, also at 9.30am GMT. Then at 10am, we should get confirmation that the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate was a meagre 0.3% in November. Greek politics: MPs hold their first vote to elect (or reject) the government\u2019s candidate for president tonight, from 5pm (although the vote may be later). The Athens parliament is expected to reject Stavros Dimas \u2013 so we\u2019ll be looking to see how many votes the government gets. The third and final vote is on the 29th... The financial markets, which are being spooked by events in Moscow and Athens. Traders are also nervous ahead of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly meeting tonight, from 7pm GMT . The Fed may change its forward guidance, and drop the pledge to keep interest rates near zero for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

Shire, which earlier in the year saw a proposed takeover from US group Abbvie collapse, was said to be interested in New Jersey based rare disease specialist NPS Pharmaceuticals, which is valued at around $4bn. Bloomberg reported that Shire also had other possible targets in mind. Earlier Shire unveiled a $2.1bn loan facility which it said might used to finance \u201cthe general corporate purposes\u201d of the company. The reports sent Shire\u2019s shares up 32p to \u00a345.22. Overall, markets had another volatile day ahead of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s latest report and the first of three presidential polls in Greece. An early fall for the FTSE 100 followed more trouble for the Russian rouble, which central bank intervention did little to help. But the currency\u2019s slide was seemingly halted after the bank announced further measures to support the financial sector, including allowing banks to temporarily ignore losses caused by the currency crisis. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said: Although cautious ahead of the Fed meeting, indices are continuing to rally quietly off the lows of the week. [Tuesday] may have been the day that the December selling stopped and the Santa rally began, and that picture seems to be reinforced today. We have seen further attempts to push indices down but end-of-year buyers appear to be returning in force, with European indices firmly off their lows and the FTSE 100 consolidating its hold above 6300. European indices look at lot healthier than they did just two days ago, helped along by a eurozone CPI figure that remained in-line with expectations and assuaged building deflation fears. The FTSE 100 finished up 4.65 points at 6336.48 having falling as low as 6240 and climbed as high at 6359. Wall Street was also higher ahead of the Fed, whose comments on interest rates could cause further volatility, rising more than 100 points by the time London closed. The oil price also stablilised after the Russian moves, adding around 1% to $60.79 a barrel, so energy and commodity shares were among the leading risers. Tullow Oil added 13.7p to 195.1p, BP was 13.6p better at 397.55p, BG Group rose 27.5p to 854.7p, and Royal Dutch Shell B shares ended 61.5p better at 2155.5p. Rio Tinto added 74.5p to 2801.5p as Deutsche Bank issued a buy note, albeit cutting its price target from \u00a346.60 to \u00a343.33. The bank was positive on Russian steelmaker Evraz, up 10.9p at 129.1p, and lifted its target from 123p to 164p. Dixons Carphone climbed 13p to 439.7p after a positive response to its first results as a merged company. Finally Yolo Leisure and Technology, an Aim vehicle backed by entrepreneur Chris Akers who holds 5.55% and run by Thomas Cook\u2019s former ecommerce specialist Simon Robinson jumped 18% to 2.575p after the company made its first investment. It is paying \u00a3300,000 for a 2.27% stake in Gfinity, a gaming platform which is due to list on Aim next Tuesday. Traders said Yolo wanted a 3% stake but was scaled back due to it being oversubscribed. Gfinity, which allows a community of professional and casual gamers to compete on the likes of FIFA 2015 or Call of Duty, has raised \u00a33.5m and will have a market capitalisation of \u00a313.2m. Other investors in Gfinity include entrepreneur Nigel Wray (who will have a 13.7% stake) and investment manager Hargreave Hale with 9.96%.",

Based on this investigation, the special committee decided \u201cit would not be appropriate\u201d for Charney to be reinstated as chief executive.

The allegations against Charney have included claims that he allowed an American Apparel staff member to post nude photographs on the internet of a former female employee who had taken legal action against him and that he misused company funds.

With the general election less than five months away, the government is keen to generate a feelgood factor to close Labour\u2019s small lead in the polls. There are a number of reasons why the chancellor has cause for some optimism. The first piece of good news for ministers is that average earnings are now definitely rising. Pay excluding bonuses in the three months to October were 1.6% higher than in the same three months a year earlier. In October alone, it was 1.8% higher. This is still modest by the standards of yesteryear \u2013 earnings tended to grow by at least 4% a year before the financial crisis \u2013 but the trend is upwards. The even better news is that wages are rising more quickly than prices, with the result that the longest squeeze on living standards since Victorian times is now over. What\u2019s more, inflation is still falling, which means the pick-up in real earnings growth will accelerate between now and the election. Plunging global oil prices mean that the annual inflation rate as measured by the consumer prices index is likely to fall as low as 0.5% in the first few months of 2015. Consumers will be spending less on heating their homes and running their cars, leaving more left over for discretionary spending. That\u2019s the third plus for the chancellor. A fourth is the now virtual certainty that the Bank of England will hold off from raising interest rates until after the election. Two members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee favour an increase in official borrowing costs from their record low of 0.5%, but none of the other seven members seemed inclined to join Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty in pressing for tighter policy. Mortgage rates are going to stay low. The final reason for Osborne to feel cheery is that unemployment continues to fall, albeit at a slightly slower pace than it was earlier in the year. There are almost 600,000 more people in work than there were a year earlier, and there has been a 560,000 rise in the number of full-time jobs. With people more likely to lose their jobs and more likely to find one if they are currently workless, consumer confidence should strengthen. There are, of course, reasons why the chancellor would be unwise to be counting electoral victory just yet. The current improvement comes very late in the parliament. Not everybody is benefitting from higher earnings, with official data showing that those on lower incomes tend to face higher inflation rates. It may take time for people to register that their living standards are rising, and even then they may not give the government any credit. But history suggests that support for the government picks up in the last few months before an election. And the current state of the economy should reinforce that trend.",

Charney was put under suspension in June, but still served as a consultant to the company, which became famous for its Made in America T-shirts and Y-fronts but was also accused of using adverts that verged on being pornographic. The company said it had terminated his position \u201cfor cause\u201d after an internal investigation. Schneider, who officially takes over in January, has previously served as a senior executive at retail and clothing companies including Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria. Shares in American Apparel rose 5 cents, or by 8.6%, to 63 cents in after-hours trading on the back of the announcement. The stock closed up 3 cents at 58 cents on Tuesday, down 53% this year. The company has operated under two interim CEOs since Charney was removed, most recently Scott Brubaker, who will continue in the role for the rest of the year. Canadian-born Charney founded the company in 1998 with the help of a loan from his father, and piloted it to success under a \u201cmade in America\u201d ethos. However, it was damaged by a series of lawsuits alleging that Charney had inappropriate sexual conduct with female employees, and shares fell until the board moved against Charney, who has said that the sexual relationships he had with workers were consensual. The company said a special committee of its board decided that \u201cit would not be appropriate for Mr Charney to be reinstated as CEO or an officer or employee\u201d based on the results of an internal investigation. At the same time as the harassment claims surfaced, the brand\u2019s appeal began to fade as changing fashion trends and the recession caused sales to plummet. American Apparel manufactures clothes and sells them in 245 of its own retail stores in 20 countries and has about 10,000 employees. Charney launched a campaign earlier this year to get his job back and said he would seek severance pay of up to $25m (\u00a315m) if he was unsuccessful.",
