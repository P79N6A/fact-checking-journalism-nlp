      "bodyText": "Britain has suffered a \"lost decade\" in living standards after a second year of sharp falls in inflation-adjusted pay pushed incomes back to levels last seen in the early 2000s, according to official figures released on Thursday. Data from the Department for Work and Pensions showed that two successive years in which real incomes dropped by 3% per annum wiped out modest gains made in the previous eight years and pushed an extra 1 million people below the absolute poverty line. The DWP's annual report on households living below average income showed median income at \u00a3427 a week in 2011-12. When adjusted for inflation, this was slightly below the \u00a3429 in 2001-02 and well down on the \u00a3454 peak in median income in 2009-10. Pay freezes and \"economic restructuring\" during the deep and the prolonged slump were the main causes of the fall in living standards, the DWP said. The figures showed that absolute poverty among children rose by 300,000, with two-thirds of those living in households with one or more earners. Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: \"Despite all the talk about 'scroungers' and generations of families never working, today's poverty figures expose comprehensively the myth that the main cause of poverty is people choosing not to work. \"The truth is that for a growing number of families, work isn't working. The promise that work would be a route out of poverty has not been kept as wages stagnate and spending cuts have hurt low-income working families.\" Falls in income affected those on high, low and middle pay, leaving income inequality unchanged between 2010-11 and 2011-12. Using the relative poverty yardstick, the number of children living in households with incomes of less than 60% of the national median remained unchanged at the lowest level since the mid-1980s. Anita Tiessen, deputy executive director of Unicef UK, pointed out that the figures predate said: \"The number of children living in poverty in the UK is likely to be even higher than the government's statistics suggest. In the time period covered by today's figures, major austerity measures \u2013 like council tax benefit cuts and the introduction of the bedroom tax \u2013 had not yet come into force, so this data does not reflect their probable harmful impact on children's wellbeing.\" The IFS said the fall in real incomes would have been smaller had an alternative to the Retail Prices Index been used to make the inflation-adjusted comparisons. Even so, it added, real incomes in 2011-12 would have returned to 2004-05 levels. More detailed analysis of the government's figures by the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals a stark generational divide in the way incomes have been affected since the onset of recession. Older people \u2013 those in their 60s and 70s \u2013 have fared best, and have actually seen their average incomes rise, by 2%-3%, between 2007-08 and 2011-12. Those in their 20s have been the worst-affected age group, reflecting the fact that unemployment rates for younger workers have been relatively high. Their average income declined by as much as 12% between 2007-8 and 2011-12, after adjusting for inflation. The IFS said this pattern continued a long-term trend in the run-up to the crisis. People in their 20s saw their incomes stagnate from 2001 onwards as wages flatlined, while rising spending on pensions helped to insulate the elderly. The fresh evidence that younger people have been hit hardest by the crisis is likely to rekindle arguments about whether the elderly have got off lightly. David Phillips, senior research economist at the IFS, said substantial changes in the welfare system had helped to reduce relative poverty rates among both pensioners and children over the past fifteen years. Once their lower housing costs are taken into account, pensioners are now at less risk of falling into relative poverty than working-age adults. \"This is in many ways a triumph of social policy. But these figures also confirm that it is young people who have suffered most as a result of the recent recession and who are now at risk of falling further behind. It is important that policymakers and politicians understand these profound changes to patterns of low incomes and respond accordingly.\"",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron appeared to play down the prospect of an early sell-off of Royal Bank of Scotland on Thursday even as the bailed-out bank kickstarted the search for Stephen Hester's successor as chief executive. RBS appointed City headhunter Anna Mann to seek candidates to lead the 81% taxpayer-owned bank through a privatisation that the bank believes could start next year. But the prime minister told Bloomberg that he thought taxpayers were more interested in getting their money back than in seeing the bank returned swiftly to the private sector. \"It will take time, because this is a bank that is still healing,\" he said. \"As for when we get it back into the private sector, I just have two very simple concerns: one is we must make sure this bank contributes to the recovery of the UK economy. Secondly, people put their money in. I want them to get their money out.\" Shares in the 81% taxpayer-owned bank slumped as investors gave their first reaction to Hester's surprise resignation, cushioned by a payoff of up to \u00a35.6m, amid anxiety about political interference. Labour's Treasury spokesman, Chris Leslie, attacked the government for a \"shambolic and uncertain approach\". A further scaling-back of the investment bank was announced on Thursday, involving 2,000 job cuts \u2013 20% of the workforce. It has already been reduced from 24,000 under Hester's tenure, which started at the time of the October 2008 bailout. Uncertainty about the future leadership of the bank was compounded when chairman Sir Philip Hampton told Bloomberg that when Hester's successor had been named, \"other aspects of board succession will be addressed\". Hampton, chairman for just over four years, added that he had \"no plans to step down at this stage\". Despite reports that Hampton had been told by UK Financial Investments, which looks after the taxpayer's stake in bailed-out banks, that the Treasury wanted to privatise RBS next year, the Treasury insisted there was no timetable for a sell-off. In a statement to MPs, forced by Labour, Treasury minister Sajid Javid attempted to justify a payoff for Hester \u2013 a \u00a31.6m contractual entitlement and up to \u00a34m in share bonuses \u2013 by saying it was a third of what he was entitled to under a contract signed by the previous Labour government. He also said Labour had overpaid for RBS shares. Javid told MPs the government had no target price for the sell-off and no fixed timetable and was not eyeing the May 2015 general election. The shares, down 7% at one stage, ended the day more than 3% lower at 315p after Javid's statement, wiping nearly \u00a31bn off the bank's value and making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. The government is awaiting publication of the report by the parliamentary commission on banking standards before setting out its strategy for the banks in next week's Mansion House speech. The report is complete but a publication date has not yet been set, although Pat McFadden, the Labour MP who sits on the commission, told Javid it did not contain a \"permission slip\" to sell off RBS on the cheap. In appointing Mann to find Hester's replacement, Hampton is turning to one of the City's best-known headhunters. She founded Whitehead Mann but now runs WMW Consulting. As RBS announced another overhaul of its investment bank following a \u00a3390m fine for rigging Libor, Hester wrote to staff to thank them for their support since he was parachuted in to replace the ousted Fred Goodwin. \"Five years is a long time for anyone to serve as chief executive. The endless scrutiny we all face carries a cost, but it has always been offset for me by the warmth and support of colleagues from across the business to carry on,\" Hester said. \"RBS lost sight of why it was founded, and it nearly died as a result. We've got back to a place where we can once again focus on the customer above all else. If there is one positive legacy to take from our past mistakes it must be that we never, ever forget why we are here,\" he said. Investment bankers were told that the bank was further retrenching from overseas and pulling out of risky operations such as complex derivatives. \"Our aim is to streamline the business, reduce complexity, mitigate operational risk and improve the way in which we manage our activities front-to-back,\" said the newly appointed heads of the investment bank, Peter Nielsen and Suneel Kamlani. The pair, appointed after John Hourican quit in the wake of the Libor fine, have effectively created a mini \"bad bank\" for the operations being run off. The latest job cuts signalled the restructuring of a key RBS unit ahead of a privatisation that Hester said could take years.",

      "bodyText": "If George Osborne had wanted a \"no change\" candidate to squire the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street gently through the next five years, he could have opted for any of several high-flying Brits, including well-respected deputy governor Paul Tucker. Instead, Bank insiders believe Mark Carney has been handed a mandate for change. The chancellor is hoping Carney will shake things up on at least three fronts \u2013 and on all of them the Canadian faces serious challenges. Monetary policy First, there is monetary policy-making. The Bank has created an extraordinary \u00a3375bn of money through its unprecedented programme of quantitative easing, yet GDP remains more than 2% below its pre-crisis level, making this the weakest recovery from any recession in a century. There has been some cause for optimism, according to recent data, including the slight fall in unemployment in the latest labour market figures. But Carney stresses the importance of economies reaching \"escape velocity\", which looks a long way off. Yet if he hopes to jumpstart the recovery through more monetary stimulus he will have to persuade the monetary policy committee to back him \u2013 and six members have repeatedly rejected Sir Mervyn King's calls for a fresh \u00a325bn of quantitative easing in recent months. As Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, puts it: \"To start voting for easing they probably need a better reason than 'the new governor wants me to'.\" In Canada, Carney pioneered the \"forward guidance\" approach. As the economy began to pick up in 2009 investors and mortgage borrowers fretted that interest rates would rise; the Bank of Canada responded by publicly promising to keep borrowing costs on hold (provided inflation didn't take off) for a further year. Osborne has asked the Bank to decide by August whether it would like to adopt a similar approach. But here, too, Carney may face opposition from MPC members, several of whom have expressed scepticism about the idea. At the Bank of Canada there is a governing council that discusses monetary policy, but no minutes are published, no vote is taken, and what the governor says, goes. And even if the economy starts recovering strongly at some point during Carney's five-year term he will have to face the fraught question of how to extricate the Bank from its \u00a3375bn money-creating spree without sparking a sharp rise in interest rates across financial markets. Any hint that the Bank is readying itself to sell off some of its huge government bond portfolio, or to push up interest rates, is likely to cause bond investors to take flight, pushing up borrowing costs and potentially putting any recovery at risk. Fixing the banks The second fraught area for Carney is Britain's battered financial system. The Bank of England has been handed back the responsibility for supervising the banks, lost in 1997, and the newly-fledged Prudential Regulation Authority will be under his remit. The authority will have to oversee implementation of the Vickers reforms, which will fundamentally redraw the shape of the UK banking system, imposing a ringfence between banks' high-street operations and their investment arms, which are perceived to be riskier. Meanwhile, Osborne is charging headlong towards privatisating the bailed-out Lloyds and RBS banks, and the new financial policy committee is involved in a controversial debate over its decision to force banks to raise more capital. So Carney takes over a bank supervisory regime in flux, at a time when the rules are changing, and the banks are far from recovered from the ravages of the great recession. Fixing the Bank The changes to the Bank's remit are also relevant to Carney's third big challenge: fixing the culture of an entity that many feel has become too hierarchical, fusty and out of touch. Alistair Darling, who had a series of run-ins with Carney's predecessor, King, during the financial crisis, referred to the latter as the \"sun king\", with untrammelled power in Threadneedle Street. The Bank has already changed radically since the downturn hit. But Carney will be expected to bring the institution into the 21st century. A public survey, published in the Bank of England quarterly bulletin, shows that while public confidence in the institution has grown, the sharp drop that occurred with the onset of the crisis has yet to be reversed. Fewer than half of households \u2013 35% to 40% \u2013 said, in this survey, that they were \"fairly or very satisfied\" with the way the Bank was doing its job, and 20% to 30% were \"fairly or very dissatisfied\". The new governor will be hoping to improve those ratings. Even for someone with Carney's impressive reputation, these appear a formidable set of challenges. But as Craig Wright, the Royal Bank of Canada's chief economist, puts it: \"Firefighters go where the fires are.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government's campaign to kickstart a shale gas revolution in Britain received a major boost on Thursday when Centrica joined in by promising to spend up to \u00a3160m on a key licence near Blackpool. The UK's biggest domestic energy supplier and parent of British Gas has paid what some in the City believed a \"surprisingly high\" price for its 25% stake in the Bowland basin held by smaller pioneers Cuadrilla Resources and AJ Lucas. It means Sam Laidlaw, the Centrica boss, and Lord Browne, a Cuadrilla director, two of the UK's most prominent businessmen and both with close links to ministers, are now spearheading a fracking industry that still faces significant hurdles in proving the extent of genuine reserves and reassuring the public over safety. Michael Fallon, the energy minister working with the Treasury on a new tax regime for fracking, said Centrica's expertise in the energy sector as an operator and developer was a big step forward for shale in Britain. \"Their investment is a vote of confidence in the significant efforts this government has made to create the right environment to accelerate the development of shale in a responsible way,\" he said. Centrica, which as recently as January played down hopes that Britain could replicate the dramatic reduction in gas prices seen over the past two years in America through shale, said it made sense to get involved now. \"With North Sea gas reserves declining and the UK becoming more dependent on imported gas, it is important that we look for opportunities to develop domestic gas resources, to provide affordable sources of gas to our customers, and to deliver broader economic benefits to the UK,\" said Mark Hanafin, managing director of Centrica's international exploration and production business.

UK-wide investment could reach \u00a33.7bn a year, supporting 74,000 jobs across the industry and its supply chain, the report said. The discovery in the US of huge amounts of shale as a result of using new techniques such as horizontal drilling and \"fracking\" the rock using chemicals has led to a huge new shale industry that sent prices of natural gas plummeting from above $10 per million British thermal units to below $3 and turned the country from a gas importer to a potential exporter. Shale is also helping to revitalise a previously troubled manufacturing sector in the US by allowing cheap energy to drastically reduce the cost per unit of US factories, supporters claim.

    "webTitle": "Tokyo share drop prompts jitters in world markets", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A plunge in shares in Tokyo prompted jitters in the world's emerging markets yesterday as investors expressed fresh concern about the Japanese government's recovery plan and the possible phasing out of America's stimulus programme. Japan's leading stock market index, the Nikkei, fell by more than 6%, extending the fall in recent weeks to more than 20%, the official definition of a bear market. The decline \u2013 accompanied by a rise in the Japanese yen on the foreign exchanges \u2013 triggered falls on other Asian bourses and led to early falls on European markets. But nerves were later steadied by stronger than expected jobs and retail sales figures from the US and the FTSE 100 in London ended the day five points higher at 6304. Economic reforms announced by the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe late last year prompted a hefty rise in share prices and a fall in the value of the yen. But in recent weeks, markets have started to voice doubts about the ability of Tokyo to use a bond-buying programme and fiscal expansion to lift the country out of deflation. Thursday's uneasy mood was not helped when the World Bank revised down its forecasts for global growth this year from 2.4% to 2.2%. Markets are now waiting to see whether next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve will provide clues as to when America's central bank might start to slacken the pace of its quantitative easing programme. Julian Jessop, chief global analyst at Capital Economics, said: \"Only a few weeks ago, the complaint was that the spill-over of liquidity from the advanced economies threatened to destabilise markets in the developing world. Now it seems as if the one thing worse than more QE is less QE. More seriously, emerging market equities have again demonstrated how hard it is for them to decouple from developed markets, particularly during a wider sell-off.\" Meanwhile, Portugal's deep recession and rising political tensions risk undermining the country's bailout programme, despite a fresh easing of its deficit targets, according to the International Monetary Fund. In its latest progress report on Portugal, the IMF confirmed that it has agreed Lisbon's tough deficit reduction goals should be loosened \u2013 by 1 percentage point in 2013, and 1.5 percentage points in 2014 \u2013 as the economy slows. \"In view of the significant deterioration in the macro-fiscal outlook, there was agreement that the fiscal deficit path under the programme needed to be recalibrated,\" the IMF's report said. Portugal's debt-to-GDP ratio is now expected to peak at 124% next year, two percentage points higher than at the IMF's last review earlier this year. That decision has been seen as part of a gradual shift away from doctrinaire austerity within the \"troika\" \u2013 the coalition of the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank that has overseen eurozone bailouts. But despite the more accommodating stance towards rescued governments, Portugal's deficit targets remain tough, and the IMF is concerned that the public could reject the austerity measures being demanded of their government. \"The hitherto sturdy social and political consensus that has buttressed strong programme implementation has weakened significantly,\" it warned. The IMF stressed that the outlook for Portugal's economy remains \"sombre\". The economy contracted by 3.25% last year, and it is now expected to shrink again, by 2.25%, this year, partly driven by the slowdown across the rest of the euro area. \"Strong export growth, which has hitherto helped offset the contraction in domestic demand, has of late started to decrease reflecting weakening demand from the rest of the euro area\". It added that unemployment, which is already at 18%, is likely to continue rising until at least 2014. Portugal will receive the next tranche of its bailout, worth \u20ac657m, as a result of the IMF's review.",

      "body": "<p>A plunge in shares in Tokyo prompted jitters in the world's emerging markets yesterday as investors expressed fresh concern about the Japanese government's recovery plan and the possible phasing out of America's stimulus programme.</p> <p>Japan's leading stock market index, the Nikkei, fell by more than 6%, extending the fall in recent weeks to more than 20%, the official definition of a bear market.</p> <p>The decline \u2013 accompanied by a rise in the Japanese yen on the foreign exchanges \u2013 triggered falls on other Asian bourses and led to early falls on European markets. But nerves were later steadied by stronger than expected jobs and retail sales figures from the US and the FTSE 100 in London ended the day five points higher at 6304.</p> <p>Economic reforms announced by the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe late last year prompted a hefty rise in share prices and a fall in the value of the yen. But in recent weeks, markets have started to voice doubts about the ability of Tokyo to use a bond-buying programme and fiscal expansion to lift the country out of deflation.</p> <p>Thursday's uneasy mood was not helped when the World Bank revised down its forecasts for global growth this year from 2.4% to 2.2%. Markets are now waiting to see whether next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve will provide clues as to when America's central bank might start to slacken the pace of its quantitative easing programme.</p> <p>Julian Jessop, chief global analyst at Capital Economics, said: \"Only a few weeks ago, the complaint was that the spill-over of liquidity from the advanced economies threatened to destabilise markets in the developing world. Now it seems as if the one thing worse than more QE is less QE. More seriously, emerging market equities have again demonstrated how hard it is for them to decouple from developed markets, particularly during a wider sell-off.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Portugal's deep recession and rising political tensions risk undermining the country's bailout programme, despite a fresh easing of its deficit targets, according to the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>In its latest progress report on Portugal, the IMF confirmed that it has agreed Lisbon's tough deficit reduction goals should be loosened \u2013 by 1 percentage point in 2013, and 1.5 percentage points in 2014 \u2013 as the economy slows.</p> <p>\"In view of the significant deterioration in the macro-fiscal outlook, there was agreement that the fiscal deficit path under the programme needed to be recalibrated,\" the IMF's report said.</p> <p>Portugal's debt-to-GDP ratio is now expected to peak at 124% next year, two percentage points higher than at the IMF's last review earlier this year.</p> <p>That decision has been seen as part of a gradual shift away from doctrinaire austerity within the \"troika\" \u2013 the coalition of the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank that has overseen eurozone bailouts.</p> <p>But despite the more accommodating stance towards rescued governments, Portugal's deficit targets remain tough, and the IMF is concerned that the public could reject the austerity measures being demanded of their government.</p> <p>\"The hitherto sturdy social and political consensus that has buttressed strong programme implementation has weakened significantly,\" it warned.</p> <p>The IMF stressed that the outlook for Portugal's economy remains \"sombre\". The economy contracted by 3.25% last year, and it is now expected to shrink again, by 2.25%, this year, partly driven by the slowdown across the rest of the euro area.</p> <p>\"Strong export growth, which has hitherto helped offset the contraction in domestic demand, has of late started to decrease reflecting weakening demand from the rest of the euro area\".</p> <p>It added that unemployment, which is already at 18%, is likely to continue rising until at least 2014. Portugal will receive the next tranche of its bailout, worth \u20ac657m, as a result of the IMF's review.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney, the Canadian banker hand-picked by chancellor George Osborne to take the reins at the Bank of England has a life motto: \"Learn, Earn, Serve\". And so far, it has all gone exactly to plan. So important was learning that as an 18-year-old he left his home country and enrolled at Harvard, then Oxford, twice, once for a masters and back a few years later for a PhD. One don who taught Carney still has one of his essays tucked away in a filing cabinet: because he rated it so highly, he took a photocopy. One of the examiners of Carney's doctoral thesis in 1995 was John Vickers (now Sir), who ran the Independent Commission on Banking. Little can he have imagined that less than 20 years later he would be competing against \u2013 and losing out to \u2013 this promising student for the job of governor of the Bank of England. The earning years were \u2013 naturally \u2013 at Goldman Sachs, where he was marked out as one of the very highest flyers while working in London, Tokyo and New York. The switch to public service \u2013 and the public profile that brings \u2013 came with a move into central banking, first as deputy and then as governor of the Bank of Canada, in a spell that included the global financial collapse. Canada came through the turmoil in far better shape than many and Carney's role during the crisis, and as chairman of the international Financial Stability Board, the central bankers' club which is rewriting the rules of banking in the wake of the meltdown, marked him out, according to Osborne, as \"the outstanding central banker of his generation\". Serving, however, has not put an end to Carney's earning power. Using the hard-nosed negotiating skills learned on Wall Street, he secured a pay package to move to London of \u00a3874,000, including a \u00a310,000-a-month housing allowance \u2013 nearly three times the salary of outgoing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King. On the first day in his new job, 1 July, which happens to be Canada Day, Carney will arrive in a very different workplace from the one he has just left. In the 70s-era glass and slate foyer of the Bank of Canada, opposite Ottawa's green-roofed mock baronial parliament buildings, instead of the august and gloomy hush that greets visitors to the Bank of England, there is a cheerful buzz as staff arrive back from lunch clutching giant coffee cups, joshing and planning their weekends. Some are even wearing trainers or jeans, unheard of in the hallowed corridors of the Bank, where new arrivals are detained at the door by pink jacketed, top-hatted flunkies. The pavements outside in Ottawa are dotted with tourists, instead of the sharp-elbowed City workers of the Square Mile. It's not just the BoC's relative youthfulness \u2013 at 78 a mere stripling next to the 318 years of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street \u2013 that explains the lack of haughtiness here. Close observers of Carney's five years in charge (it was meant to be seven, until Osborne made him an offer he couldn't refuse), say his leadership style has been instrumental in transforming its culture. One of Carney's first acts when he arrived, in the teeth of the worldwide financial crisis in February 2008, was to insist that senior staff were issued with Blackberrys \u2013 anathema to his predecessor, David Dodge. Staff soon realised why: even the lowliest number-cruncher could expect to receive sudden email requests for information or analysis. \"He just collapsed the hierarchy,\" one insider recalls. Surprise candidates who clinch top jobs are often said to have \"come from nowhere\" but for the driven 48-year-old, it is almost true. Fort Smith, where Carney spent the first six years of his life, is a tiny town of fewer than 2,500 people, way up in Canada's north-west, more than 600 miles from the nearest city, Edmonton. He may have taken his first degree at Harvard, his doctorate at Oxford, and acquired the carefully-groomed air of a Goldman Sachs banker, but friends say his formative years in the back of beyond still matter. \"His roots govern his perspective of the little guy, of the common person. Is he urbane? Yes. Is he urban? Yes and no,\" says Mel Cappe, professor of public policy at the University of Toronto, and a former secretary of cabinet, who knows Carney well. The family (his parents were teachers) moved to Edmonton, in oil-rich Alberta, where Carney attended the Catholic St Francis Xavier high school. He is still a fan of the local hockey team (don't say \"ice hockey\"), the Edmonton Oilers. Westerners, as people from this part of Canada are known, pride themselves on being self-reliant outsiders. When the federal government made a grab for a larger share of the region's oil revenues during Carney's teenage years, in a bid to cap prices for energy users across Canada after the Middle East oil crisis, a favourite local bumper-sticker read, \"Let Those Eastern Bastards Freeze in the Dark\". Perhaps it is a residual memory of this deep suspicion of federal interference that has encouraged Carney to make communicating with the public central to his job. Indeed, so keen is he on making himself understood in England that he is bringing his own press spokesman with him from Ottawa. As governor of the Bank of Canada, Carney has travelled far and wide across the vast country to try to justify his policies to ordinary people \u2013 and observers say this ability to explain comes from that upbringing out west. \"He's very good at making monetary policy make sense for citizens,\" says Scott Brison, economic spokesman for the Liberal party \u2013 known as \"finance critic\" \u2013 and , a personal friend of Carney's. A sojourn in Brison's cottage in Nova Scotia fuelled speculation that Carney might be flirting with a move into politics \u2013 something many believe is still likely, since he has made clear he only wants to stay in England for five years, instead of serving a full eight-year term. \"I think he definitely took a look at whether he wanted to take a run at being the leader of a political party, and maybe the prime minister, and I don't think you can rule out political aspirations of some kind in the future,\" says Ted Carmichael, managing director for strategy at the giant Canadian pension fund OMERS, and a former chief Canadian economist for JP Morgan. Carney arrived at the Bank of Canada as a relative unknown. \"He kind of came out of the blue here. There was this vacancy at the Bank of Canada, and this guy nobody had ever heard of got it,\" says Carmichael. It came about after he had been spotted by Dodge. There was a plan to privatise Ontario's hydroelectric power generator, Hydro One, and Goldman Sachs had sent its savviest, most impressive young Canadian up to Toronto to try to clinch the deal. The privatisation never came off, but Carney had made his mark in the minds of the public officials who met him. When the deputy governorship of the Bank came up in 2003, he applied, and got the job. Soon afterwards, he moved over to the finance department, the equivalent of the Treasury, to become the brightest of its bright young men. Peter DeVries, a long-time senior civil servant who saw him at close quarters at that time, recalls: \"I guess when he first arrived, a lot of us were just taken aback by his brilliance. He became the go-to guy when people were looking for a solution. You would have 20 people in the boardroom and everyone would wait for him to clear his throat.\" That picture is echoed repeatedly in Canada's close-knit policymaking circles, where Carney is proudly, and affectionately, referred to as a \"rock star\". \"There are few rooms he's going to walk into where he's not the smartest guy in it,\" says Don McCutchan, a former senior finance department official, now at Toronto law firm Gowlings. \"Mark Carney is a very strong personality: he tends to dominate a room,\" agrees Carmichael. By the time Dodge's term was nearing an end, in early 2008, few in the financial markets had any illusions that the turmoil in financial market, that had already been raging for months, would get far worse. The job was widely expected to go to a senior insider, Paul Jenkins. But crucially, Carney was regarded as possessing the financial nous that would be necessary as the shockwaves from the US sub-prime crash spread. Dodge had already cut interest rates once before he stepped down, but during Carney's first few months in office, he slashed them to record lows, and pumped unprecedented liquidity into the financial system to stabilise the banking sector. Helped by its massive oil and gas resources, Canada suffered a short, shallower recession, instead of the deep downturn that is still hobbling most major economies. Paul Martin, the Liberal finance minister from 1993 to 2002, and later prime minister, says: \"He was a very strong central bank governor. He had a lot of experience, he had the skills, and he was an excellent communicator.\" Throughout the downturn and the recovery, Carney has used communication aggressively in a bid to make monetary policy more effective. In 2009, just as the economy started to recover and markets and mortgage-borrowers feared that rates were about to rise, he committed the Bank to keeping them low for another 12 months \u2013 barring a surge in inflation. Carney has since been a strong advocate of such \"forward guidance\", as a way of preventing borrowing costs across the economy from shooting up as investors bet on a rate rise. Osborne, presumably under the influence of Carney, has offered the Bank of England the opportunity of adopting the same approach. \"I think it helps,\" says Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada. \"At a minimum it sends signals to the markets that the Bank's not going to turn on every wiggle in the data. It also sends a message to consumers and businesses. I think that makes sense in the UK environment.\" As well as using new tools in monetary policy, Brison says Carney's ability to stand toe to toe with bankers has been critical. \"Mark has the economic background; but also he has personal understanding of the industry. He has peer-to-peer credibility with some of the top bankers in the world. There's a language; there's a cadence.\" In his international role, as chairman of the G20's Financial Stability Board, he has not only been a strong advocate of tighter regulation, but notched up a furious shouting match with JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon. Perhaps not surprisingly, given how fast he has risen, Carney has a steely side: several people remembered being warned off disagreeing with him. And he had that life-plan from a relatively early age. \"I have heard him say 'learn, earn, serve,'\" says Brison. \"He is someone who chooses public service: he is not a materialistic guy.\" In other words, the young Carney set himself the deliberate aim of making big money early in his career, so that he could go into public service later. That's an idea corroborated by his doctoral supervisor, Margaret Meyer, who recalls that as a postgraduate student at Nuffield College, Oxford \u2013 after his first stint at Goldman Sachs \u2013 he already had a plan to take up a policy role. Like many who came across the young Carney, Meyer remembers being impressed. \"What really distinguished Mark Carney from other students was his intellectual versatility and the rapidity with which he was able to get up to speed with new approaches and new techniques. He has a very agile mind\". Carney's British-born wife, Diana, an economist whom he met at Oxford, is also a policy wonk. She worked at the Department for International Development and the Overseas Development Institute thinktank before moving to Canada. More recently, she has worked at the progressive thinktank Canada 2020, speaking out on political issues such as rising income inequality. The Carneys have four young girls, and while many acquaintances seem to rack their brains when asked what the smartest guy in the room he does for fun (\"he'll have a pint and a plate of nachos like the rest of us\" was the best one colleague came up with; an Ottawa neighbour mentioned super-fast jogging), he is by all accounts an enthusiastic dad. One fellow member of the Five Lakes Fishing Club, in the wilderness of the Gatineau Hills outside the capital, says affectionately that his most vivid picture of the central bank governor is of him \"standing there in his swimming trunks, holding up his three-year-old daughter \u2026 Mark and his women\". It's hard to imagine someone with so much evident self-confidence managing to remain quite so well liked as Carney is by the easy-going Canadians; but Ed Clark, chief executive of TD, one of Canada's largest banks, who knows him well, says he can do self-effacing if he needs to. \"He's going to get the lie of the land, he's going to listen to people, he's going to have to figure out what's politically possible. You'll be surprised how quickly he comes out and says, 'I'm not God: I'm an above-average guy.'\" \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June to correct the spelling of Gatineau Hills and the reference to the Liberal party being the opposition. They are currently the third largest party",

One fellow member of the Five Lakes Fishing Club, in the wilderness of the Gatineau Hills outside the capital, says affectionately that his most vivid picture of the central bank governor is of him \"standing there in his swimming trunks, holding up his three-year-old daughter \u2026 Mark and his women\".</p> <p>It's hard to imagine someone with so much evident self-confidence managing to remain quite so well liked as Carney is by the easy-going Canadians; but Ed Clark, chief executive of TD, one of Canada's largest banks, who knows him well, says he can do self-effacing if he needs to. \"He's going to get the lie of the land, he's going to listen to people, he's going to have to figure out what's politically possible. You'll be surprised how quickly he comes out and says, 'I'm not God: I'm an above-average guy.'\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 June to correct the spelling of Gatineau Hills and the reference to the Liberal party being the opposition.

    "webTitle": "Eurozone crisis live: Thousands protest against Greek broadcaster's closure - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After this morning's tumble, European stock markets ended the day rather calmer. The FTSE 100 actually rose 5 points, as encouraging data on US retail sales and jobless claims eased fears over central banks cutting their stimulus packages. After dominating the headlines, Royal Bank of Scotland was the biggest faller - down 3.2%. Here's the closing prices (and the latest ones from Wall Street) So what's afoot in the financial market? Here's a couple of expert views: Julian Jessop of Capital Economics: The markets still seem disappointed that the Bank of Japan failed to ease monetary policy further at its meeting on Tuesday in response to the recent volatility in the financial markets. But any suggestions that the Japanese central bank is cooling on the need for a substantial and prolonged easing in monetary policy are wide of the mark. After all, it was only in April that the Bank set out a clear and aggressive strategy of doubling the monetary base within two years to lift inflation to around 2%, which was much more than most had anticipated at the time. It would be quite wrong to conclude that the Bank is backtracking on that commitment now. ..... The reaction in emerging markets has been striking too. Only a few weeks ago, the complaint was that the spill-over of liquidity from the advanced economies threatened to destabilise markets in the developing world. Now it seems as if the one thing worse than more QE is less QE! More seriously, emerging market equities have again demonstrated how hard it is for them to decouple from developed markets, particularly during a wider sell-off. However, provided the recent slide does not turn into a rout, emerging markets with low inflation and limited foreign debt may actually welcome some renewed currency weakness. Alastair McCaig, Market Strategist, IG European markets were given a solid kick towards negative territory before the market open with the news that the Japanese Nikkei index had closed down another 6.35% on the day and was now off over 20% from its highs, confirming that it had moved into a bear market. With limited economic data out in the morning session to shift mentality, gloom descended on trading floors across the City. The FTSE spent much of the morning within touching distance of the 200-day moving average and there was a palpable fear that a breach of this would lead to an even more pessimistic sentiment. Half-an-hour after the US open a calmer sense of perspective emerged as the FTSE traded 100 points above its early morning low. Last night's out-of-hours shock that Stephen Hester, the CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland, would be stepping down by the end of the year and before the bank had managed to completely float again, ensured that not only RBS but the banking sector as a whole started the day heavily in the red. Without a prepared replacement and with confidence such a fragile commodity for the banking sector, it was no surprise that the shares were trading down over 5% from the open. With almost unbearable pressure from the government and particularly close scrutiny from the press it is not instantly obvious who will be queuing up for this not particularly well-paid FTSE 100 job. .... Who knows what delights tomorrow will bring? Probably more market turbulence, more pressure on the Greek government over ERT, and more speculation about the future of RBS! Until then, thanks and goodnight. GW In something of a blunder, it appears the Greek government failed to register the domain name for its new, slimmed-down broadcaster, New Hellenic Radio Internet and Television, or NERIT. And it's now too late. An ERT supporter has snapped up www.nerit.gr, and is using it to broadcast - wait for it - the latest signal from ERT itself, as it continues to defy closure: The general strike in Greece has caused havoc at Athens airport, where air traffic controllers held a two-hour walkout. Our correspondent Helena Smith landed there this afternoon*, and reports by email: There is MASS CHAOS at Athens airport where all means of transport with exception of taxis has been cut by strike. I'm standing in a queue running a mile long at taxi rank. Most are befuddled tourists who have no idea what is going on! Neither do any Greeks because of news blackout. The timing of the Greek PM's decision to shut down ERT at the beginning of the tourist season appears to have been disastrous for Greece's biggest foreign currency earner! * - Helena had been in London attending Amnesty's Media Awards 2013, where she was nominated for her fine work covering the crisis in Greece. After a day inside the ERT headquarters in Athens, reader Kizbot reports that the workers taking part in the sit-in are keeping their morale up. She tells me: There are a lot of very tired, worried journalists in there. But plenty of fighting spirit. And the support from around the world is helping keep spirits up. . As flagged up earlier, Greek state TV's news channel, NET, was dramatically switched on again this afternoon, thanks to the Geneva-based European Broadcasting Union. The EBU is managing to take a feed of NET from a studio in Thessaloniki and retransmitted it back to Greek homes over a satellite link. It's another blow to the Greek government's attempt to shutter the broadcaster, although other channelr are still offline. My colleague Lisa O'Carroll explains: The EBU said the signal is available globally on these satellites: Hotbird 13A in Europe, APSTAR 7 in Asia and Intelsat 19 in Oceania. adding: Staff in Athens managed to keep a makeshift service going on the internet on Wednesday, but this too was closed down, leaving the Thessaloniki output as the last link to the Greek people. Early on Thursday, the EBU announced it was streaming the ERT feed on its website. But the EBU was able to begin TV broadcasts for ERT on Thursday afternoon after it was discovered that the satellite time had been prepaid by the Greek organisation. Here's Lisa's full story: Greek state TV switched back on as European broadcasters step in ERT's press office issued a statement this afternoon, urging Greek MPs not to allow police to enter their headquarters to halt their broadcasts. In a statement, they said: We demand from the Greek Parliament, where the majority is against the closing down of the ERT that they: order the Minister of Public Order and Citizen Protection to hold back any decision about the intervention of police forces in the area and buildings of ERT. order the Minister of Finance to take back all that has been told about the protection of the property of ERT. People who work in the ERT guarantee the public property of the Greek people. Adding that they also asked the Greek president to use his influence to prevent police being deployed. Re my last post, ERT's service is also still reaching Chile, a listener named Eduardo kindly flags up. Shutting down a broadcaster is harder than you might think..... The Greek government failed to prevent ERT's radio services being broadcast as far as America. Thomas Witherspoon, a radio enthusiast in Swannanoa, North Carolina, tells me that he was able to listen to the Voice Of Greece being transmitted over shortwave radio last night, and also on Tuesday after the shutdown began. Thomas tells me: I captured recordings of the Voice of Greece going off the air the other night, then coming back on later. They've remained on the air since then; indeed, I recorded them well into the night last night. And he's uploaded recordings to prove it. Here's a clip of the Voice Of Greece coming back online, late on Tuesday night, as ERT workers battled to keep its services running. More here: Voice of Greece on shortwave throughout the night, despite ERT shut down My colleague Lisa O'Carroll reports that the European Broadcasting Union have found a way to get some of ERT's services broadcast into people's homes again, by satellite: Full details to follow.... The EBU kept ERT broadcasting yesterday by installing equipment in its car park in Athens. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras appears to be looking to defuse the political crisis sparked by his decision to shut the country's state broadcaster. Samaras's decision to meet with his junior coalition partners, Pasok's Evangelos Venizelos and Democratic Left's Fotis Kouvelis, on Monday night is an attempt to prevent his administration being dragged deeper into crisis. Despite thousands of people taking part in today's protest rally, and the opposition of Venizelos and Kouvelis, Samaras's government is reluctant to change course. A senior government official told Reuters that Samaras was open to discussing their proposals and a compromise was likely, though he did not intend to back down from closing ERT and relaunching a smaller, more efficient entity. The official said: I believe there is scope for compromise and we will not go to new elections. Pasok and Democratic Left welcomed the meeting, which was announced this morning, but insist that ERT should not be closed. Venizeloz said: The country doesn't need elections, they would be a colossal mistake, but PASOK is not afraid of them....We support a radical restructuring of ERT, but not with blacked-out screens. And here's a video clip of today's rally outside ERT's HQ: Reuters reckons that 13,000 protesters gathered outside ERT's headquarters. Many waved flags, or held banners reading \"Fire Samaras, not ERT workers!\" ERT workers formed a human chain at the building's entrance. \"Samaras can't tell us what to watch or not. This isn't about ERT or about its workers any more, it's about democracy and freedom of speech,\" said Thanos Lykourias, 30, an office worker, who earns 800 euros a month and lives with his mother. Back in Greece, more than 10,000 people have taken part in a large rally has taken place outside the headquarters of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corp, or ERT. With today's general strike underway, the march was a show of defiance against the government's decision to close ERT down. Staff at the broadcaster continued the sit-in that began on Tuesday, refusing to bow to government pressure and abandon their service. ERT was broadcasting online again today, despite the Greek ministry of finance threatening to withdraw the licence of any private Greek TV channels which broadcast its services on their frequencies. One of our readers, Kizbot, remains inside the studios and confirms that journalists are \"trying to hold it together\", nearly two hours after the government suddenly announced its closure (see 10.51am and 11.11am, for Kizbot's ealier photos) And Theodora Oikonomides, one of our regular contacts in Greece, reports there were 'high spirits' at the rally today: Back in the financial markets, the picture in Europe is a little less alarming. Shares are still down, but most indices have clawed their way back from the early selloff, sparked by the Asian rout and the news that the Japanese Nikkei has now slumped into bear market territory (a hefty 20% below May's peak). Here's the latest prices \u2022 FTSE 100: down 48 points at 6250, -0.8% \u2022 German DAX, down 108 points at 8034, -1.33% \u2022 French CAC: down 18 points at 3775, -0.5% \u2022 Spanish IBEX, down 92 points at 8032, -1.13% We've just had some upbeat economic news from the US \u2013 retail sales rose by 0.6% in May, and the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefit dropped by 12,000 last week. That has driven up the US dollar against other currencies, and means Wall Street shares aren't expected to fall as sharply when trading opens in an hour. Oh, and Marketwatch sums up the confusing picture in Japan here: Royal Bank of Scotland's shares have recoved some ground during the government statement on Stephen Hester's departure. They are now down 3.8% at 313p (still the biggest faller on the FTSE 100), having taken a 6% tumble as the City have an early thumbs-down to last night's news. Traders may be encouraged that the RBS privatisation hasn't been knocked off course by the change of CEO. Sajid Javid reiterated several times that the government wants RBS back in private hands, helping the UK economy. Highlights of the statement start at 11.31am. Caroline Lucas, Parliament's only Green MP, asks Sajid Javid why the government is so keen to sell its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland at all. It would be better, she says, to keep RBS in public hands and use it to drive useful projects such as housebuilding and home insulation, creating thousands of jobs. Javid disagrees, saying: The government has no long-term role in owning any part of the banking sector. The session is now over. Verbal fisticuffs between Labour's Chris Bryant and economic secretary Sajid Javid. Bryant tells MPs that you can always tell when the government is in trouble because \"the chancellor runs for cover\" and sends a junior minister in to the chamber to deny everying, \"in this case unconvincingly\". Bryant clearly isn't persuaded that George Osborne didn't have a role in Hester's departure. Javid hit back, reminding MPs that Bryant spoke of \"a new golden age for the City of London\" during his time in government, before the financial crash struck. Perhaps they missed Andrew Tyrie's comments a few minutes earlier (see 11.53am) about how politicians should stop harking back to the past and should focus on fixing today's problems... Charlie Elphicke, Conservative MP, urges the government to return RBS to the public sector as swiftly as possible -- and to give shares to the public in recognition of the taxpayer's role saving RBS. That would mean that those who paid for it get something back for it, Elphicke says. Sajid Javid (who's been responding to all the questions for the government), replies: We are looking at our future plans for the state-owned banking sector. However, we feel it is prudent to wait for the report from the Commission for Banking Standards. The idea of a share giveaway \u2013 in the style of the 1980s privatisations of various utility firms \u2013 has excited many Conservatives. But as the Observer wrote in April, people should treat cautiously.... David Ward MP says it is clear that George Osborne has sacked Stephen Hester. Is there a gagging clause preventing him from speaking out? Sajid Javid denies that the chancellor kicked Hester out. Conservative MP Julian Smith says RBS's staff need to be protected during the handover period until a new CEO is in place. Javid agrees, saying they have played a key role in improving RBS's balance sheet. Hester's own MP, Sir Tony Baldry, speaks up for \"his constituent\", saying he did a very good job after getting a poisoned chalice from the previous government. Pat McFadden, a Labour MP who serves on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, issues a clear warning shot to Sajid Javid and the government over RBS. \"If they're looking for a permission slip for a sale [of RBS] at a knock-down price\" they will be disappointed, McFadden said. That Committee will release its report into the sector soon - and may include recommendations for the future of RBS. Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury committee, speaks next. He says Hester did \"a very difficult job extremely well\". Tyrie also isn't impressed by the point scoring, saying the public just want to see RBS back on its feet and serving the UK economy. Economic secretary Sajid Javid responds. He ducks Leslie's first point, saying that chancellor George Osborne isn't there because he's there instead. He tells MPs that Osborne did not meet with Hester in the last few weeks, and had not pushed the CEO out of the door, \"This is a decision for RBS and its board,\" Javid insists. On the 6% drop in RBS's share price today, Javid points out that \"nearly every bank is down\" as part of today's market selloff. The Nikkei also fell 6% today, he points out. True.... but the FTSE 100 is only down 1%, and RBS is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 by some distance. Javid also denies that the government wants to sell RBS quickly (something that is often rumoured): We have no target prrice for RBS. we have no fixed timetime, and that does not include the general election, he said. \"We just want the best price for the taxpayer\". Javid finished with a jab at Labour, saying they \"overpaid by \u00a312bn\" when they bailed out RBS. Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow treasury minister, responds to Javid's statement -- saying it's very disappointing that George Osborne is not here to answer questions on RBS. Leslie also asks 1) whether Hester jumped, or was pushed. 2) is any truth in speculation that Sir Philip Hampton, the RBS chairman, is also planning to leave the bank (he spoke about the need for succession planning in an interview with Bloomberg today) 3) Why is there no successor? Is Hester being shoved out of the door so that the government can sell its RBS stake before the next election Leslie points out that today's fall in RBS's share price (down nearly 6%) has cost taxpayers around \u00a32bn. It's time to end the confusion of RBS's future, Leslie concludes, and handle the bank in an orderly way. Sajid Javid then explains that the government is pushing on with its reforms to the UK's banking sector. This includes implementing the Vickers review, changing the \"culture and the ethics of trhe banking industry\", and pushing for more choice in the sector. We are still mopping up the huge economic mess we inherited from the party opposite. Now it's time to move from the rescue phase to the recovery phase at RBS, and return the bank to the private sector, he adds. Sajid Javid confirms that Hester will receive a payment of \u00a31.6m when he leaves RBS, along with various unvested shares that are worth around \u00a34m. Javid points out that Hester only received one annual bonus under his time at RBS. He also suggests that Hester's payoff is not the fault of the current government. Hester will be leaving with \"one third of the maximum he could have received under the contract agreed under the previous government in 2008\", says Javid Over in parliament, economic secretary Sajid Javid is giving a statement on Stephen Hester's departure from Royal Bank of Scotland Javid begins by commending Hester for the job he has done over the last five years: When Stephen Hester took over, the bank was on the brink of collapse with a broken culture and a risk to financial stability. Hester brought it back from the brink, says Javid. He tells MPs that the size and complexity of RBS has been reduced, with a renewed focus on its UK customers. Hester has made an important contribution to Britain's recovery from the financial crisis, he adds. More to follow.... Stephen Hester. the outgoing chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, send a memo to staff last night. In it, he thanks them for the progress made since the bank 'nearly died' in the financial crisis. Here's the full memo: Dear colleague, The Board is announcing today that it is starting the search for a new Group Chief Executive of RBS to lead the company through privatisation and beyond. I plan to step down by the end of this year, or earlier if a successor is in place, and to help the company as much as I can in the meantime. Nothing about this decision was easy, but I can see that as we head towards a potential privatisation, now provides a window for the company to put in place a Chief Executive that can give fresh energy to the challenge of leading RBS through the next phase. I joined RBS at its lowest point. We were a company close to the point of collapse with no clear path back to recovery. All the odds and much of the opinion was against us, but your efforts and strengths proved to be the biggest asset in ensuring we could recover the business for everyone who relied on us. Five years is a long time for anyone to serve as Chief Executive. The endless scrutiny we all face carries a cost, but it has always been offset for me by the warmth and support of colleagues from across the business to carry on. This strength of teamwork is no more evident than in the leadership team that exists in RBS today. It is the strongest such team we could wish for and is well placed to steer the business through the next phase of our journey to become a really good bank. I\u2019ve been conscious since first taking up this role that the success of RBS should never again be cast in the image of one person. Companies rarely succeed or fail on the actions of individuals, but on the skills and strength of character present in all those who work within them. I have believed for some time now that the recovery process revealed strength of character in RBS that lay dormant. In the face of significant challenge, we have proven ourselves as determined and capable people, quietly rebuilding a company that the nation depends on. But more than this, it is now clear to me that RBS is a company of decent, hardworking people who care a lot about doing the right thing for customers. In the time I have spent with so many of you, I am always heartened when I see the depth of belief you have in doing the best for our customers. It may surprise our critics, but this is often matched by goodwill on the part of the many customers I meet in all parts of our business who truly want us to succeed. Our future success starts and finishes with this focus on customers. We\u2019ve made it our purpose to serve them well, and if we truly obsess about meeting their needs over our own, then RBS will become a really good bank. We know this to be right, not because we think it is, but because our customers tell us this is what they want. RBS lost sight of why it was founded, and it nearly died as a result. We\u2019ve got back to a place where we can once again focus on the customer above all else. If there is one positive legacy to take from our past mistakes it must be that we never, ever forget why we are here. Leading RBS is an exceptional task, only made possible by the fact that I work with exceptional people. Thank you for all your commitment, support and teamwork. Be sure to continue to serve customers well. Yours sincerely, Stephen Proof that Greece's economic pain continues -- the country's jobless rate rose to 27.4% in the first quarter of 2013, a new record high, up from 26% in the las three months of 2012. It's the highest quarterly unemployment rate since this data series started in 1998. Out in Athens, blog reader Kizbot has now got inside the headquarters of ERT -- here's the view of the protests outside (see also 10.51am) Important political news from Greece -- the leaders of the country's three coalition parties are due to hold talks on Monday evening, at 6pm local time. It will allow them to discuss the government's decision to shut the ERT broadcaster, and reopen it later this summer with a much smaller staff. The meeting between Prime minister Antonis Samaras, Pasok leader Evangelos Venizeloz, and Democratic Left's Fotis Kouvelis had originally been called for Saturday, but was quickly pushed back. That delay may add to the uncertainty in Greece. Over in Greece, a protest rally is underway outside the headquarters of state broadcaster ERT following its shock closure on Tuesday night. It is organised by the unions holding today's strike (see 9.25am). One of our regular readers, Kizbot, is there, and reports that there's something of a \"festival\" atmosphere. She reckons the demonstrators number into the thousands, but there's no police presence beyond a traffic cop, she tells me. She also kindly sent me several photos: Heads-up: The issue of Stephen Hester's resignation from Royal Bank of Scotland, and its implications for the taxpayers' 81% stake in the bank, will be discussed in parliament in an hour's time. The government has decided to make a formal statement to MPs at 11.15am about the departure, after Labour tabled an urgent question about the issue. I'll cover it here in the blog. Stock markets have also been hit by the news that the World Bank has cut its growth forecasts for this year. It now predicts a deeper-than-expected recession in Europe, and a slowdown in China and India. Overall, the Bank believes the global economy will only achieve growth of 2.2% this year, down from 2.4% at the start of the year. The Bank may have been caught out by the lack of growth in recent months, and the ongoing recession in Europe. Kaushik Basu, chief economist at the World Bank, explained: While there are markers of hope in the financial sector, the slowdown in the real economy is turning out to be unusually protracted. This is reflected in the stubbornly high unemployment in industrialised nations, with unemployment in the eurozone actually rising, and in the slowing growth in emerging economies. Here's the full story on the World Bank forecasts, by my colleague Angela Monaghan: Global stock markets fall after World Bank cuts growth forecasts Back to the financial markets, and the selloff in Asia has sent many markets to their lowest levels in month. Uncertainty over US monetary policy (see 8.40am) and concern that Japan's yen was strengthening drove the rout, analysts saisd Hong Kong's Hang Seng index has fallen 2.2% to close at its lowest level since last October. China's Shanghai Composite index has also joined in the selloff, dropping 2.8% to a six-month low on its first day's trading after a three-day holiday. Thailand is down 5.5%, and the Phillipines market has fallen 6%, as Fast FT flags up: Japan's Nikkei remains the stand-out faller after today's 6.35% slide (see 8.10am). Over in Greece, the general strike called in protest at the closure of the ERT state broadcaster is well underway. Public transport links are hit, with buses and subway services halted in Athens and a reduced service on metro trains and trams. Some tax offices and schools are closed, while hospitals will be working on emergency staff, according to local reports. The strike was called by the ADEDY (public sector) and GSEE (private sector) unions, in solidarity with workers at ERT. A rally is due to take place outside the ERT headquarters this morning. Here's Reuters early take: Iron shutters blocked the entrance to the state-run Athens subway stations early on Thursday and city buses did not run. Several marches were expected to culminate in demonstrations outside ERT's headquarters, where workers have gathered since the closure was announced. But there was little sign of private businesses joining the strike. City streets were full with commuters and car traffic, supermarkets were open for business and cafes were serving customers as usual. \"The lowest ERT employee is making in a day what I'm making in a week, so why should I strike for them?\" said vegetable vendor Yannis Papailias as he sorted out his wares. The shock departure of Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester has clearly unnerved the financial community, helping push its shares down over 6% in early trading. If the government helped to push Hester out to speed up the privatisation of the bank (81% owned by the public), that strategy may have backfired. Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, cut his rating on RBS to \"sell\" from \"hold\", and warned: This announcement increases the uncertainty around the shares and potentially delays further any return of the bank to private ownership. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, agreed: The departure of the well-respected Chief Executive comes at a crucial time in RBS\u2019 reinvention. The market can only hope that a replacement has already been identified in order to minimise the uncertainty which has now been added to the company\u2019s turnaround plans. Whilst the official line is that the Board felt that a new incumbent was needed to carry the bank forward post-privatisation, this masks the immense contribution the CEO has made in his tenure at the bank amidst extremely challenging conditions. Speculation regarding further cuts to its markets operations are adding further fuel to the uncertainty. The UK government has owned four-fifths of RBS since the rescue of the bank in 2008: That famous City humour remains undimmed, though: Here's the list of biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, led by Royal Bank of Scotland. Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, blames today's share selloff on fears that central banks, led by America's Federal Reserve, will start to tighten monetary policy soon. He said: After that tumultuous session in Asia, London equity dealers have unsurprisingly been left staring at screens awash with red as markets open. For weeks, traders have been anticipating the time when the Fed will start to slow (or 'taper') its programme of buying bonds with billions of dollars of newly created money. That policy has helped to calm the markets, and drive up asset prices world wide. As McCudden puts it: Given the boost lax monetary policy has given markets this year - especially in Europe and the US - then there's plenty more room on the downside for the sell-off to continue. So far the FTSE is holding above the key 6,200 level but with every one of the blue chips currently in negative territory, whether this can be sustained in the longer term remains to be seen. European stock markets are deep in the red in early trading, as the big overnight losses in Asia drives a wave of selling in the City. The FTSE 100 fell by 92 points at the start of the session, down 1.5% to 6207. The selloff is lead by Royal Bank of Scotland, down 6.5% as traders digest the news that chief executive Stephen Hester has been forced out of the bank. Other European markets are hit too: French CAC: down 1.2% Spanish IBEX: down 1.5% Italian FTSE MIB: down 1.4% Reaction to follow Today's 6.35% slump on the Nikkei takes Japan's stock market down to the lowest level since April 3 -- the day before the country's huge stimulus programme was announced. Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic asset allocation AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, told the Wall Street Journal that investors were dashing to traditional safe havens: It is a sentiment driven fall that is feeding on itself. Investors seem to be taking profits wherever they can. Every single share on the index fell today. The 'top' performer on the Nikkei fell by 0.17%, while the 'bottom' performers shed almost 10%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone and the global economy. There's drama everywhere we look today. European stock markets are expected to fall sharply after heavy losses in Asia overnight, while in Greece the row over the shock closure of its state broadcaster ERT continues. The Japanese Nikkei has closed down 6.35%, shedding 843 points to finish at 12,445. That's more than 20% lower than the highest point hit last month -- meaning it's officially in 'bear market' territory, Bloomberg says: And while shares in Japan slid, the yen surged over 2% to \u00a594 against the US dollar. There were big falls across Asia, with the Thai stock market sliding over 5%. Some traders are blame the selloff on anticipation that central banks will ease their stimulus packages soon: As Credit Suisse economist Robert Prior-Wandesforde put it: Markets are effectively in the process of pricing this in, with the most expensive markets generally taking the biggest hit. But there's also a rash of profit taking (the NIkkei's tumble only takes it back to a two-month low), and general concern over economic prospects, particularly in emerging markets. The latest developments in Greece, and the anti-government Turkish protests have all hit the markets, explains Michael Hewson of CMC Markets in his morning note: This is not the only factor as rising political tensions in Greece as well as the unrest in Turkey has seen investors pull money out of these countries, while European peripheral bond yields have started to edge higher again as the recent rally in Greek, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian debt comes to a sharp halt as investor realise that high yields do not a safe investment make. Of course there is the other reason is that for all of the stock market gains of recent months investors have finally woken up to the fact that current stock valuations are not supported by fundamentals in the current low growth environment, and all the QE in the world can\u2019t address that particular issue. Europe's stock markets are being called down over 1% -- they open at 8am BST... Royal Bank of Scotland will be in the spotlight in London following yesterday's resignation of CEO Stephen Hester. Is the government moving closer to selling the taxpayers 81% stake? I'll also be watching events in Greece, where transport links have already been hit as the strike called by its biggest unions gets underway. Further protests against the closure of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation are expected today. The big question, though, is will the country's coalition government hold together?....",

Here's a couple of expert views:</p> <h2>Julian Jessop of Capital Economics:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The markets still seem disappointed that the Bank of Japan failed to ease monetary policy further at its meeting on Tuesday in response to the recent volatility in the financial markets. But any suggestions that the Japanese central bank is cooling on the need for a substantial and prolonged easing in monetary policy are wide of the mark.</p> <p>After all, it was only in April that the Bank set out a clear and aggressive strategy of doubling the monetary base within two years to lift inflation to around 2%, which was much more than most had anticipated at the time. It would be quite wrong to conclude that the Bank is backtracking on that commitment now.</p> <p>.....</p> <p>The reaction in emerging markets has been striking too. Only a few weeks ago, the complaint was that the spill-over of liquidity from the advanced economies threatened to destabilise markets in the developing world. Now it seems as if the one thing worse than more QE is less QE! More seriously, emerging market equities have again demonstrated how hard it is for them to decouple from developed markets, particularly during a wider sell-off. However, provided the recent slide does not turn into a rout, emerging markets with low inflation and limited foreign debt may actually welcome some renewed currency weakness.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Alastair McCaig, Market Strategist, IG</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European markets were given a solid kick towards negative territory before the market open with the news that the Japanese Nikkei index had closed down another 6.35% on the day and was now off over 20% from its highs, confirming that it had moved into a bear market. With limited economic data out in the morning session to shift mentality, gloom descended on trading floors across the City.</p> <p>The FTSE spent much of the morning within touching distance of the 200-day moving average and there was a palpable fear that a breach of this would lead to an even more pessimistic sentiment. Half-an-hour after the US open a calmer sense of perspective emerged as the FTSE traded 100 points above its early morning low.</p> <p>Last night's out-of-hours shock that Stephen Hester, the CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland, would be stepping down by the end of the year and before the bank had managed to completely float again, ensured that not only RBS but the banking sector as a whole started the day heavily in the red. Without a prepared replacement and with confidence such a fragile commodity for the banking sector, it was no surprise that the shares were trading down over 5% from the open. With almost unbearable pressure from the government and particularly close scrutiny from the press it is not instantly obvious who will be queuing up for this not particularly well-paid FTSE 100 job.</p> </blockquote> <p>....</p> <p>Who knows what delights tomorrow will bring? Probably more market turbulence, more pressure on the Greek government over ERT, and more speculation about the future of RBS!</p> <p><strong>Until then, thanks and goodnight.

Photograph: STEFAN WERMUTH/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Stephen Hester. the outgoing chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, send a memo to staff last night.</strong> In it, he thanks them for the progress made since the bank 'nearly died' in the financial crisis.</p> <h2>Here's the full memo:</h2> <p>Dear colleague,</p> <p>The Board is announcing today that it is starting the search for a new<br> Group Chief Executive of RBS to lead the company through privatisation<br> and beyond. I plan to step down by the end of this year, or earlier if<br> a successor is in place, and to help the company as much as I can in<br> the meantime.</p> <p>Nothing about this decision was easy, but I can see that as we head<br> towards a potential privatisation, now provides a window for the<br> company to put in place a Chief Executive that can give fresh energy<br> to the challenge of leading RBS through the next phase.</p> <p>I joined RBS at its lowest point. We were a company close to the point<br> of collapse with no clear path back to recovery. All the odds and much<br> of the opinion was against us, but your efforts and strengths proved<br> to be the biggest asset in ensuring we could recover the business for<br> everyone who relied on us.</p> <p>Five years is a long time for anyone to serve as Chief Executive. The<br> endless scrutiny we all face carries a cost, but it has always been<br> offset for me by the warmth and support of colleagues from across the<br> business to carry on.</p> <p>This strength of teamwork is no more evident than in the leadership<br> team that exists in RBS today. It is the strongest such team we could<br> wish for and is well placed to steer the business through the next<br> phase of our journey to become a really good bank.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been conscious since first taking up this role that the success<br> of RBS should never again be cast in the image of one person.<br> Companies rarely succeed or fail on the actions of individuals, but on<br> the skills and strength of character present in all those who work<br> within them.</p> <p>I have believed for some time now that the recovery process revealed<br> strength of character in RBS that lay dormant.</p> <p>In the face of significant challenge, we have proven ourselves as<br> determined and capable people, quietly rebuilding a company that the<br> nation depends on. But more than this, it is now clear to me that RBS<br> is a company of decent, hardworking people who care a lot about doing<br> the right thing for customers.</p> <p>In the time I have spent with so many of you, I am always heartened<br> when I see the depth of belief you have in doing the best for our<br> customers. It may surprise our critics, but this is often matched by<br> goodwill on the part of the many customers I meet in all parts of our<br> business who truly want us to succeed.</p> <p>Our future success starts and finishes with this focus on customers.<br> We\u2019ve made it our purpose to serve them well, and if we truly obsess<br> about meeting their needs over our own, then RBS will become a really<br> good bank. We know this to be right, not because we think it is, but<br> because our customers tell us this is what they want.</p> <p>RBS lost sight of why it was founded, and it nearly died as a result.<br> We\u2019ve got back to a place where we can once again focus on the<br> customer above all else. If there is one positive legacy to take from<br> our past mistakes it must be that we never, ever forget why we are<br> here.</p> <p>Leading RBS is an exceptional task, only made possible by the fact<br> that I work with exceptional people.

That's more than 20% lower than the highest point hit last month -- meaning it's officially in 'bear market' territory, Bloomberg says:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BloombergNews/statuses/345061479118172160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Nikkei 225 closes 20% below May 22 high, enters bear market</p>&mdash; Bloomberg News (@BloombergNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BloombergNews/statuses/345061479118172160\">June 13, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And while shares in Japan slid, the yen surged over 2% to \u00a594 against the US dollar.</p> <p>There were big falls across Asia, with the Thai stock market sliding over 5%.</p> <p>Some traders are blame the selloff on anticipation that central banks will ease their stimulus packages soon:</p> <p>As Credit Suisse economist <strong>Robert Prior-Wandesforde</strong> put it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets are effectively in the process of pricing this in, with the most expensive markets generally taking the biggest hit.</p> </blockquote> <p>But there's also a rash of profit taking (the NIkkei's tumble only takes it back to a two-month low), and general concern over economic prospects, particularly in emerging markets.</p> <p>The latest developments in Greece, and the anti-government Turkish protests have all hit the markets, explains <strong>Michael Hewson</strong> of <strong>CMC Markets</strong> in his morning note:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not the only factor as rising political tensions in Greece as well as the unrest in Turkey has seen investors pull money out of these countries, while European peripheral bond yields have started to edge higher again as the recent rally in Greek, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian debt comes to a sharp halt as investor realise that high yields do not a safe investment make.</p> <p>&#xa0;Of course there is the other reason is that for all of the stock market gains of recent months investors have finally woken up to the fact that current stock valuations are not supported by fundamentals in the current low growth environment, and all the QE in the world can\u2019t address that particular issue.</p> </blockquote> <p>Europe's stock markets are being called down over 1% -- they open at 8am BST...</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland </strong>will be in the spotlight in London following yesterday's resignation of CEO Stephen Hester. Is the government moving closer to selling the taxpayers 81% stake?</p> <p>I'll also be watching events in Greece, where transport links have already been hit as the strike called by its biggest unions gets underway. Further protests against the closure of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation are expected today.<strong> <strong>The big question, though, is will the country's coalition government hold together?....</strong></strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-13T08:14:51.867Z\">at 9.14am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "webTitle": "Global financial markets anxious to avoid many pitfalls of 'political risk'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When investors in the world's financial markets are in an anxious mood, such as in recent weeks, any new piece of information tends to be taken as a fresh reason to sell. Their overarching concern \u2013 and the markets' frame for almost everything else that happens \u2013 is that the US Federal Reserve may be considering \"tapering\" its massive quantitative easing programme, amid signs that the world's largest economy is starting to recover. It's unlikely that any change to the Fed's bond-buying plan is imminent; but the merest hint \u2013 dropped by chairman Ben Bernanke on 22 May \u2013 that the flood of cheap money that has supercharged markets could slow to a trickle has been enough to rock confidence. Against that background, investors were already in a mood to pull funds out of riskier emerging markets, which won't look such a great bet without cheap money to gamble with. Elsewhere the turmoil in Greece, with the abrupt shutdown of the state broadcaster prompting renewed alarm about the stability of the governing coalition, reopened familiar fears about the euro crisis. Meanwhile, the violent crackdown on protests in Turkey \u2013 formerly seen as a paragon of stability \u2013 has given added impetus to investors' desire to run a mile from what is politely called \"political risk\". Another set of markets rocked in recent days has been those such as Australia, where the economy is heavily dependent on exports to China. There are increasing signs that China is slowing as its growth model changes, and there are also alarming reports about the fragile state of the financial sector. A sharp downturn in China would rock a whole range of economies that rode out the Great Recession on the back of rampant Chinese demand. The final factor alarming investors is that the gloss appears to be coming off Abenomics \u2013 the Japanese government's plan for radically rebooting the country's economy. Many commentators have been disappointed by the so-called \"third arrow\" of Abe's policies. In addition to fiscal stimulus and \"shock and awe\" quantitative easing, Abe was expected to use the breathing space created by QE to implement a range of structural reforms to kickstart stodgy businesses and rebuild the tax system. But so far there has been scant detail.
