Last week a Senate committee quizzed the JP Morgan boss on the still mounting losses at the bank's London offices. The House committee was far more combative in tone.</p> <p>Congressman Barney Frank, co-author of the Dodd-Frank regulations brought in after the last financial crisis, asked Dimon if his wages would be subject to \"clawback\" following the disclosure of the losses. Last week Dimon said staff at the bank who were responsible for the London losses could have their pay reclaimed under the bank's so-called clawback provisions. Dimon said that decision would be for the board to decide.</p> <p>Dimon has been Wall Street's fiercest critic of elements of the Dodd-Frank rules. Frank said Dimon had said the bank had a \"fortress balance sheet\" that would protect it from losses like those in London. \"What about institutions that are less impregnable, maybe a chain link fence, a picket fence or two?\" asked Frank. Dimon said \"all American banks are better capitalized\" after the financial crisis. \"Don't filibuster,\" said Frank.</p> <p>Politicians on both sides of the House are currently working on legislation aimed at tackling fears that after the collapse of their rivals in the credit crisis some financial institutions have become so large that their collapse could cause enormous damage to the US economy.</p> <p>Dimon was repeatedly asked about the too-big-to-fail concept. \"We can not have too big to fail. We have to get rid of too big to fail so that a bank can fail without doing damage to the economy.\" he said.</p> <p>But he defended JP Morgan's size. Dimon said a lot of banks were \"the port in the storm\" and the JP Morgan's size and diversification had allowed it to pull through the credit crisis and \"allowed us to do the things you wanted to do\" including buying failing banks like Washington Mutual, lending money to California and investing in Chrysler.</p> <p>The bank boss also fended off questions about the likely impact of the London losses or how big they would grow. He said JP Morgan would remain profitable after the loss. Asked if the losses could grow to $50m he said: \"Not unless the moon strikes the Earth.\"</p> <p>Dimon and regulators were quizzed by the panel about the role of London and its regulation in the losses. \"Every big trading disaster happens in London. I would like to know why,\" representative Carolyn Maloney asked regulators earlier in the day. \"It is a pattern.\"</p> <p>\"Our problem has nothing to do with London or any loopholes,\" Dimon said. But he said if regulation was tightened up for US banks operating overseas, US banks would lose business. \"We will lose a lot of business. They will not move to London, but I assure they will be in Singapore, in other parts of the world,\" he said.</p>",

The bank boss also fended off questions about the likely impact of the London losses or how big they would grow. He said JP Morgan would remain profitable after the loss. Asked if the losses could grow to $50m he said: \"Not unless the moon strikes the Earth.\" Dimon and regulators were quizzed by the panel about the role of London and its regulation in the losses. \"Every big trading disaster happens in London. I would like to know why,\" representative Carolyn Maloney asked regulators earlier in the day. \"It is a pattern.\" \"Our problem has nothing to do with London or any loopholes,\" Dimon said. But he said if regulation was tightened up for US banks operating overseas, US banks would lose business. \"We will lose a lot of business. They will not move to London, but I assure they will be in Singapore, in other parts of the world,\" he said.",

    "webTitle": "Pharmacy chain Walgreen takes 45% stake in Alliance Boots", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chemist chain Boots is being sold to the American retail company Walgreens in a \u00a310bn deal that is delivering a huge pay-day for its private equity owners. The sale means the chain's owner, Alliance Boots, is being absorbed by a company that is twice its size with annual sales of more than \u00a345bn. British favourites such as No7 lipsticks and Soltan sun lotion will be exported to the US, where shoppers will be able to pick them up alongside groceries in Walgreens' chain of almost 8,000 drugstores. Walgreens is initially buying a 45% stake in Alliance Boots for \u00a34.3bn, but it intends to buy the remainder for another \u00a36bn within three years. The deal is a coup for the firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina, who snatched Alliance Boots off the stock exchange in 2007 in a controversial \u00a312.2bn takeover backed with \u00a39bn of debt. At the time it was Europe's biggest ever private equity deal and KKR and Pessina were accused of loading what was termed a British institution with a mountain of debt. But on Tuesday the investors looked set to nearly triple their original investments of more than \u00a31bn each. Pessina, 70, who is based in Monaco, insisted the deal was not opportunistic but fulfilled a lifetime's dream to create a global retail and pharmacy group. \"I'm not looking for money,\" he said. \"How could I do a deal to kill Boots? I have done a deal to make Boots more visible, more international, that will create a lot of new markets for Boots.\" No job cuts were planned, the companies said, as there was little geographical overlap between the two businesses. The ownership of Alliance Boots is split three ways between Pessina, KKR and \"silent investors\" affiliated to KKR. All three groups sold 45% of their holding. Pessina will eventually collect \u00a33.4bn, with his first-stage payment of \u00a31.4bn in Walgreens shares. KKR and the linked investors will get the same amount but are being paid predominantly in cash. KKR said it had invested \u00a31.2bn in 2007 with the first instalment alone paying out that sum in cash as well as 7m Walgreens shares, worth \u00a3140m, on top. \"Following five years of successful performance, the company is now in a better position than ever before,\" said KKR partner Dominic Murphy, adding that the deal would lay the \"foundation for future growth\". The owners of Alliance Boots will acquire another \u00a36bn in cash and shares when Walgreens presses the button for a full merger, when it will also take on Boots' debt. No dividends have been paid since the 2007 deal with spare cash used to reduce its debt, which at the last count stood at \u00a37bn. Pessina, however, made about \u00a3500m at the time of the Alliance Boots de-listing as he did not roll his entire shareholding into the private company. Pessina signalled his commitment to the business by opting to be paid in shares, acquiring an 8% stake in Walgreens and taking a seat on its board. Pessina, who turned his family's ailing Naples drug wholesaler into the pharmacy company Alliance UniChem, which merged with Boots in 2006, said the manufacturing jobs in Nottingham were safe. He said the site would be the research and development centre for the merged group and new jobs could be created if Boots' own-brand products , which include Botanics and Boots Pharmaceuticals, were required in greater volumes. Pessina had already hinted that his preferred exit would be via another merger rather than a fresh stock exchange listing: \"If you do an IPO, you create financial value,\" he said. \"If you do a transformational deal, you create financial value and industrial value.\" Walgreens is keeping its headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois and its chief executive, Gregory Wasson, revealed that the companies had started talks about 18 months ago. \"Stefano and I have got to know each other well over the last couple of years,\" he said, adding that he was \"impressed\" with the Boots chain. \"Boots is to the UK much as Walgreens is to the US, both are iconic brands with similar cultures and long heritages,'' he said. The US firm was founded by the entrepreneur Charles Walgreen, who became a pharmacist after cutting the top off his middle finger working in a shoe factory. He went on to open his first store in Chicago in 1901. Boots traces its history back to 1849 when John Boot opened the first store selling herbal remedies in Goose Gate, Nottingham. Following the takeover by KKR and Pessina, the group's headquarters shifted to Zug in Switzerland. The move led to scrutiny of its tax affairs and has made it a target for protest groups like UK Uncut. Last year's profits were pulled down by finance charges of \u00a3434m relating to its multibillion-pound debts with finance director George Fairweather stating interest payments were a \"valid expense for tax purposes\". The merger is expected to deliver cost-savings of more than \u00a3600m within four years and Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Roberts said the lion's share of the savings would come from better drugs procurement with the enlarged group the world's largest purchaser of prescription drugs. He added that Boots was the \"better retailer\" with Walgreens stores cashing in on their prime locations by also selling convenience foods as well as cigarettes, alcohol and even dog food. In recent months Walgreen has reported flagging sales and with the two-stage process valuing Alliance Boots at \u00a310.4bn, the deal was not well received however by Walgreens investors; shares fell sharply after the announcement.",

      "standfirst": "Walgreens\u00a0has been eyed by the ACLU over pharmacists' reluctance to provide emergency contraception to men", 
      "body": "<p>Walgreens, already the largest drug retailing chain in the US, is to expand into the global marketplace with the takeover of Alliance Boots in the UK.</p> <p>It may have work to do on its reputation among female consumers, however, as it has repeatedly come under fire from US reproductive health activists for not doing more to ensure individual pharmacists abide by federal laws to provide emergency contraception.</p> <p>At a national level, Walgreens, which has thousands of stores across the US, complies with FDA's regulations on contraception and other healthcare provisions. But its name has become associated with a disturbing trend among pharmacists who have refused to provide over-the-counter emergency contraception to men buying it for their female partners.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said they had received a number of complaints from men who have had their requests for emergency contraception refused by pharmacists in Walgreens.</p> <p>The group complained to Walgreens several times in 2010, and received what they described as an \"encouraging response\" from the parent store, saying they had distributed a bulletin telling all its stores that emergency contraception can be sold to men and that a male customer need not be accompanied by a female customer. But since then, there have been other cases.</p> <p>Brigitte Amiri, a senior legal attorney for the ACLU Foundation, said: \"We've had a number of complaints, the most recent in Georgia in February. It is a cause for concern that it has happened again in a store in the south. We are still waiting for their response.\"</p> <p>ACLU wrote to Walgreens in 2010 after stores in Texas and Mississippi refused to sell contraception to men.

      "bodyText": "Walgreens, already the largest drug retailing chain in the US, is to expand into the global marketplace with the takeover of Alliance Boots in the UK. It may have work to do on its reputation among female consumers, however, as it has repeatedly come under fire from US reproductive health activists for not doing more to ensure individual pharmacists abide by federal laws to provide emergency contraception. At a national level, Walgreens, which has thousands of stores across the US, complies with FDA's regulations on contraception and other healthcare provisions. But its name has become associated with a disturbing trend among pharmacists who have refused to provide over-the-counter emergency contraception to men buying it for their female partners. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said they had received a number of complaints from men who have had their requests for emergency contraception refused by pharmacists in Walgreens. The group complained to Walgreens several times in 2010, and received what they described as an \"encouraging response\" from the parent store, saying they had distributed a bulletin telling all its stores that emergency contraception can be sold to men and that a male customer need not be accompanied by a female customer. But since then, there have been other cases. Brigitte Amiri, a senior legal attorney for the ACLU Foundation, said: \"We've had a number of complaints, the most recent in Georgia in February. It is a cause for concern that it has happened again in a store in the south. We are still waiting for their response.\" ACLU wrote to Walgreens in 2010 after stores in Texas and Mississippi refused to sell contraception to men. When one man who tried to buy contraception was refused, he complained to the store manager, only to find she stood by the pharmacist's decision. He then received a call from the store manager apologising but saying the store had an \"unwritten rule\" not to give the drug to men because they might give it to an underage person. She then commented there had been news reports of people dropping the drug into women's drinks. Amiri said that it seemed to be a problem with individual pharmacists in stores, because whenever they have taken it up at the corporate level, they have found Walgreens and other drug stores to have policies which comply with FDA guidelines. In response to complaints from ACLU, Walgreens stores have launched investigations and then re-trained staff in accordance with the national policy. \"It's been a problem at the store level with individual employees. At the corporate level the have been very clear that their policy is to provide contraception in accordance with FDA guidelines to men and women aged 17 and over,\" Amiri said. Amiri said it appeared to be a problem in most of the major drug stores in the US, including CVS, Rite Aid and Target, but most complaints had concerned Walgreens. \"We have seen it in different parts of the country, which makes me think there has been some advocacy group of pharmacists who don't believe in giving contraception, and individual pharmacists are using their personal beliefs to discriminate.\" The FDA has approved emergency contraception for sale behind the pharmacy counter for men and women aged 17 and older. Over the past year, the social change website Change.org has run a petition relating to the so-called \"unwritten rule\" cited by Walgreens stores in Texas. Cristina Page has chronicled efforts to obstruct Americans' access to birth control,in her book on the war on contraception, How the Pro-Choice Movement Saved America. Page said that although there are a handful of states that allow pharmacists to refuse to provide contraception, policies can be adopted that ensure patients are able to get their prescriptions for contraception while allowing for individual pharmacist's religious objections, such as having two pharmacists available. \"There is a disturbing trend with pharmacists pre-empting the healthcare decisions patients make with their doctors,\" said Page. \"These pharmacists are imposing their religious views in other people's lives based on the scientifically inaccurate belief that contraception can cause an abortion and, as a result, is against their religious beliefs. All scientific evidence shows contraception has no abortifacient effect. But providing evidence to counter these beliefs appears to be futile\" Asked if drug stores were doing enough to stop individual pharmacists taking matters into their own hands, she said: \"If even one instance happens when one patient is unable to get medication they need because of one person's specious beliefs, then not enough is being done. If something is over the counter, it's over the counter.\"",

      "body": "<p>If the stories coming out of Los Cabos are correct, the Germans have surrendered. Angela Merkel, it appears, has agreed that Europe's bailout fund should be used to buy up Spanish bonds. This is precisely the show of \"shock and awe\" that the markets have been demanding, and the immediate response will undoubtedly be positive. All the financial firepower that Europe can muster will be used in an attempt to drive down Spain's borrowing costs from the 7%-plus level they have reached this week.</p> <p>That, at least, is the talk. It is worth noting from the outset that Europe has failed to deliver on its fine-sounding rhetoric in the past. The detail of this deal may prove less impressive than the behind-the-scenes briefing, in which case the market reaction will be swift and brutal.</p> <p>But let's assume that this is for real. Why would Germany be prepared to play fast and loose with the tough conditions that Berlin itself insisted on when the European Financial Stability Facility and its successor were created.</p> <p>The rules say that the bailout funds should not take on the risks associated with buying up the debt of a member country unless it is part of an official European Union-International Monetary Fund programme. Although details are sketchy, this appears to be the sort of no-strings attached deal that Merkel has always steadfastly opposed.</p> <p>So why is this happening? Not because Germany has come under fire at the G20 summit, although it has. Not because Merkel has changed her mind about the potential costs of such an arrangement for her own taxpayers. Rather, it is because the events of the past few weeks have left Germany with a binary choice: support emergency action to prop up the eurozone's fourth biggest economy or watch monetary union slide into the abyss. Berlin does not want to be blamed for destroying the euro \"project\", and recognises that a crisis involving Spain (with Italy waiting in the wings) is of a whole different order or magnitude to one affecting Greece, Portugal and Ireland.</p> <p>What this means is that European policymakers have decided to take on the bond vigilantes. The hope is that they can drive 10-year Spanish bond yields out of the danger zone, take the pressure off the creaking Spanish banking system, and thus avoid the need for Madrid to seek formal help from the EU and the IMF.</p> <p>This, for certain, is a high stakes game. Part of Europe's fighting fund has already been spent on bailing out Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Spain has also pledged funds to the EFSF and ESM, and these clearly cannot be spent buying up the country's own debt. The markets might decide that it is worth taking on Europe in the way that George Soros did in 1992, when he saw the pound as ripe for a killing.</p> <p>That risk is exacerbated by the dire state of the Spanish economy, which is suffering from a long-lasting hangover after the bubble in its construction and property sectors in the years running up to 2007. With a tough austerity programme in place, the economy is still going backwards and house prices have further to fall. A lot further, in all probability. If the gamble fails, Spain will still need a bailout and Europe will have nothing left in the kitty for Italy. But in the circumstances, Merkel and her fellow eurozone leaders may think it is a gamble they have to take.</p>",

All the financial firepower that Europe can muster will be used in an attempt to drive down Spain's borrowing costs from the 7%-plus level they have reached this week. That, at least, is the talk. It is worth noting from the outset that Europe has failed to deliver on its fine-sounding rhetoric in the past. The detail of this deal may prove less impressive than the behind-the-scenes briefing, in which case the market reaction will be swift and brutal. But let's assume that this is for real. Why would Germany be prepared to play fast and loose with the tough conditions that Berlin itself insisted on when the European Financial Stability Facility and its successor were created. The rules say that the bailout funds should not take on the risks associated with buying up the debt of a member country unless it is part of an official European Union-International Monetary Fund programme. Although details are sketchy, this appears to be the sort of no-strings attached deal that Merkel has always steadfastly opposed. So why is this happening? Not because Germany has come under fire at the G20 summit, although it has. Not because Merkel has changed her mind about the potential costs of such an arrangement for her own taxpayers. Rather, it is because the events of the past few weeks have left Germany with a binary choice: support emergency action to prop up the eurozone's fourth biggest economy or watch monetary union slide into the abyss. Berlin does not want to be blamed for destroying the euro \"project\", and recognises that a crisis involving Spain (with Italy waiting in the wings) is of a whole different order or magnitude to one affecting Greece, Portugal and Ireland. What this means is that European policymakers have decided to take on the bond vigilantes. The hope is that they can drive 10-year Spanish bond yields out of the danger zone, take the pressure off the creaking Spanish banking system, and thus avoid the need for Madrid to seek formal help from the EU and the IMF. This, for certain, is a high stakes game. Part of Europe's fighting fund has already been spent on bailing out Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Spain has also pledged funds to the EFSF and ESM, and these clearly cannot be spent buying up the country's own debt. The markets might decide that it is worth taking on Europe in the way that George Soros did in 1992, when he saw the pound as ripe for a killing. That risk is exacerbated by the dire state of the Spanish economy, which is suffering from a long-lasting hangover after the bubble in its construction and property sectors in the years running up to 2007. With a tough austerity programme in place, the economy is still going backwards and house prices have further to fall. A lot further, in all probability. If the gamble fails, Spain will still need a bailout and Europe will have nothing left in the kitty for Italy. But in the circumstances, Merkel and her fellow eurozone leaders may think it is a gamble they have to take.",

In the Asia-Pacific region there are now 3.37 million men and women with more than $1m (\u00a3635,000) in the bank, compared with 3.35 million in North America, Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management's latest world wealth report revealed. But the overall level of wealth in North America is still the highest in the world, with its millionaires, such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, controlling $11.4tn, while Asian businessmen control $10.7tn \u2013 although wealth levels declined twice as fast in North America as in Asia in 2011. Millionaires in the US, Japan and Germany still make up more than half the world's richest, but total world wealth levels fell for the first time since the worst of the economic downturn in 2008. In the UK, which has the fifth highest number of millionaires, membership of the elite club dropped 2.9% from 454,300 to 441,300, while both Germany and France saw increases. The world's wealthiest have $42tn at their disposal, down 1.7% on 2010, with all regions seeing a fall, except the oil-rich Middle East. Jean Lassignardie, corporate vice president of Capgemini, said: \"Europe will be top of mind for investors, as repeated flare-ups [in the eurozone] are likely to keep markets on edge. Additional drivers such as the economic performance in China, mature market headwinds, global political leadership changes and policy decisions will all play key roles in determining whether 2012 drives increases.\" Several emerging markets saw wealth levels drop, in particular India and Hong Kong, which saw their number of millionaires fall by a fifth. Researchers calculated millionaires as individuals who have the funds to invest at least $1m, and revealed that 9.9 million have between $1m and $5m. This group grew slightly, 1.1%, but the richest section, with more than $30m at their disposal, dropped 2.5% to 100,000 people, with the value of their wealth also down nearly 5%. The drop is linked to some of their holdings in higher-risk investments such as hedge funds, private equity and real estate. India was worst hit due to \"a slump in its equity-market capitalisation and its currency in 2011 as a lack of faith in the political process and the slow pace of domestic reformed disappointed investors,\" according to the report. It added: \"Also hard hit in 2011 were the [millionaire] populations of Singapore and Poland, which both suffered the direct effects of the eurozone crisis.

Listening astutely in the corner was a softly spoken schoolgirl.</p> <p>\"Lang was this huge, gnarled, rogue bull from the Pilbara [a northern region of Western Australia] and I used to find it strange initially when I would go to meetings with him and he'd have his little girl, Gina, in his office,\" says Singleton, a brash and outspoken legend in Australian advertising and media circles.</p> <p>\"She'd just sit there quietly, listening to us. When we'd finished, Lang would ask me if I'd take her out to lunch. At the restaurant she'd give me these etiquette lessons from her posh girls' school, and tell me I shouldn't put salt or pepper on my food before I tasted it.\"</p> <p>Speaking her mind is something Gina Rinehart has never been shy about. As the only child of Lang Hancock, who discovered massive iron ore deposits on his family's land in Western Australian in the 1950s, Rinehart was destined from a young age to take charge of the resources juggernaut that is now Hancock Prospecting, a company she privately owns. It's made her one of the world's richest women, estimated by some to be worth A$29bn (\u00a319bn).</p> <p>This year Rinehart has taken a keen interest in media ownership and on Monday announced she had increased her stake in Fairfax Media, publishers of the country's two oldest newspapers, the Sydney Morning Herald and the (Melbourne) Age, to 18.7%.</p> <p>Now the biggest shareholder, she's rumoured to be pushing for three board seats, as well as a say on the appointment of editors and editorial matters.

Ultimately,&#xa0;she burns through many of her legal advisers.</p> <p>Rinehart is a famously private person,&#xa0;but earlier this year her family life spilled out onto the front pages. She's locked in a bitter feud with three of her four children over the control of a family trust, set up by her late father. Her three eldest children want her removed as trustee. The trust owns just under a quarter of the family business, Hancock Prospecting.</p> <p>Last year, when shares in the trust were due to vest, instead of handing them over to her children, she pushed the vesting date out to the furthest date possible, 2068, by which she would be 114 years old. She said the capital gains liability on the shares would bankrupt her children.</p> <p>Rinehart's eldest child, John, accused her of being tight with money and launched a blistering attack on her.</p> <p>\"I can support my wife and children in a modest manner from the work I do but I can't provide the level of funds required to deal with security issues \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 associated with being the son of a woman worth more than A$20bn,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>\"When my mother buys a few hundred million dollars' worth of Fairfax, it's going to draw some attention,\" he continued. \"But she won't share a penny to help protect the grandchildren from the risks she \u2013 the trustee of our family trust \u2013 is creating by her own actions.</p> <p>\"What more can I do than communicate to any kidnappers out there \u2013 over my dead body and you will be wasting your time anyway. If you think you are going to get anything from my mother, good luck.\"</p> <p>In a backflip in May this year, Rinehart reversed her decision and vested the trust immediately.</p> <p>Some have speculated that it may be a clever trap because, if the children are liable for capital gains tax and are forced to sell their shares, the only person they can sell to is a lineal descendent of Lang Hancock \u2013 that is, Gina Rinehart.</p> <h2><strong>Gina Rinehart</strong></h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>Perth, Western Australia, 9&#xa0;February 1954.</p> <p><strong>Age </strong>58.</p> <p><strong>Career </strong>Took over her father Lang Hancock's business, Hancock Prospecting Pty Limited, when he died in March 1992.&#xa0;In 2010 Rinehart took a stake in Australian TV channel Ten.

Last year, when shares in the trust were due to vest, instead of handing them over to her children, she pushed the vesting date out to the furthest date possible, 2068, by which she would be 114 years old. She said the capital gains liability on the shares would bankrupt her children. Rinehart's eldest child, John, accused her of being tight with money and launched a blistering attack on her. \"I can support my wife and children in a modest manner from the work I do but I can't provide the level of funds required to deal with security issues \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 associated with being the son of a woman worth more than A$20bn,\" he said in a statement. \"When my mother buys a few hundred million dollars' worth of Fairfax, it's going to draw some attention,\" he continued. \"But she won't share a penny to help protect the grandchildren from the risks she \u2013 the trustee of our family trust \u2013 is creating by her own actions. \"What more can I do than communicate to any kidnappers out there \u2013 over my dead body and you will be wasting your time anyway. If you think you are going to get anything from my mother, good luck.\" In a backflip in May this year, Rinehart reversed her decision and vested the trust immediately. Some have speculated that it may be a clever trap because, if the children are liable for capital gains tax and are forced to sell their shares, the only person they can sell to is a lineal descendent of Lang Hancock \u2013 that is, Gina Rinehart. Gina Rinehart Born Perth, Western Australia, 9 February 1954. Age 58. Career Took over her father Lang Hancock's business, Hancock Prospecting Pty Limited, when he died in March 1992. In 2010 Rinehart took a stake in Australian TV channel Ten. She later bought into Fairfax Media, owners of the Melbourne Age and the Sydney Morning Herald. High point In 2012 the Australian Business Review Weekly declared that Rinehart had become the world's richest woman, surpassing Walmart owner Christy Walton. Low point In 2011 she was verbally attacked by her eldest child, John, who accused her of being tight with her money. What she says \"My father \u2026 wanted to see Australia become a stronger economy benefiting from the development of our north. His life was spent pursuing that vision.\" What they say A reporter once asked her famously tough father whether Rinehart was as tough as he was. \"Oh, tougher,\" he replied. \"Yeah, by a long way.\"",

[Risks include] the possibility that the Qatar Investment Authority continues to build a position in Xstrata after the 12 July shareholder votes and the possibility that management of the merged company announces a capital allocation strategy that is very positive for shareholders (such as a commitment to a high dividend payout ratio). But with investors opting for riskier assets again, Glencore closed 1.6p higher at 330p and Xstrata added 5.7p to 864.9p. ITV was 2p better at 74.25p on vague speculation of private equity interest at 150p a share. But Unilever lost 12p to \u00a320.75 after French food group Danone warned it had cut its 2012 margin target due to the worsening economic conditions in southern Europe, Spain in particular. But the Anglo-Dutch group came off its worst levels after analysts played down the idea that much could be read into the Danone news. Elsewhere defence group Chemring closed 29.9p lower at 293.5p after it said first half profits fell 21%, mainly due to a delay in a key US defence orders until the last day of the reporting period. It added that the second half had started well and it was on track to meet full year expectations. But analyst Roger Johnston at Edison Investment Research, said: While the receipt of the delayed orders improves the short-term visibility, we feel that the significant second half weighting and potential impact of further contract paralysis in the run-up to the US Presidential election leaves Chemring in another potentially precarious position. While the 31% increase in non-NATO revenues provides relief, orders are notoriously lumpy, increasing likely volatility. Lower down the market Polo Resources ended 7% higher at 2.55p following a significant increase in the estimate of its gold reserves - 374% in fact - at its Nimini project in Sierra Leone. Finally Aim-listed Scancell Holdings, a developer of vaccines for the treatment of cancer and other diseases, rose 12% to 9.25p after positive news on its lead product, a vaccine to treat melanoma.",

      "bodyText": "A tax avoidance scheme alleged to be used by thousands of wealthy individuals, including the comedian Jimmy Carr, is under investigation by authorities. HM Revenue and Customs told the Guardian that accounting firms using a scheme to create offshore loans and new contracts of employment for UK earners were being investigated and could be taken to court. HMRC said the scheme, known as K2, was already under serious scrutiny by tax inspectors before a Times investigation on Tuesday (paywall) which alleged that comedian and presenter Carr was avoiding paying higher rates of tax by funnelling millions of his assets through a \u00a3168m Jersey-based scheme. HMRC said it was currently investigating whether the scheme was technically legal. \"If it [K2] does work technically, HMRC will challenge it in every way. There is no way anyone, no matter who they are, is going to get away with paying less than they should,\" they said. An investigation by the Times accused Channel 4's presenter of 8 out of 10 Cats and 10 O'Clock Live of sheltering \u00a33.3m a year through the K2 scheme, which an accountant selling the scheme said was used by 1,100 tax avoiders.

While all the attention has been on the government's austerity measures, it has been the less obvious, but still very real, squeeze on consumer incomes caused by rising prices that has put the brakes on the economy. Today's inflation figures suggest some respite is at last in prospect for the millions of UK citizens who have found that annual wage growth of 1% a year and annual inflation of more than 5% (at last year's peak) makes life uncomfortable. The Guardian report showing that seven million Britons are one bill away from financial trouble is a reflection of a severe squeeze on real incomes that, according to the IFS, was the harshest for 30 years in 2010-11. The moribund state of the housing market makes borrowing against rising property prices - the traditional quick-fix solution to falling real incomes - a non-starter, so households have been tightening their belts. Inflation has now dropped to 2.8%, still higher than the current rate of annual earnings growth, which is 1.6% once bonuses are stripped out. But price pressures are likely to ease further in the second half of this year for a number of reasons: oil prices are coming down sharply, last year's increase in domestic fuel bills will not be repeated, and the global economy is slowing. It would be no surprise to see the consumer price index measure of inflation back to its 2% target by the autumn. This trend will have two effects. Firstly, provided wages do not fall in tandem with prices, consumers will see their money go a bit further. This won't have an immediate impact on spending, in part because the boost to real incomes will be modest at best and partly because it will take individuals time to realise that they are slightly less financially squeezed than they were. But by the second half of 2013, rising real incomes should provide some support for the economy. Falling inflation also gives the Bank of England more scope to provide more stimulus to the economy. Members of the Bank's monetary policy committee have not so far reacted to the intensification of the eurozone's debt crisis, mainly because they have been concerned at the stickiness of inflation. Yet for once the Bank has been too pessimistic about the outlook for price increases: in April and May, CPI inflation averaged 2.9%, well below the 3.2% pencilled in by Threadneedle Street. This means that there is now nothing to stop the MPC from taking action intended to boost growth. The combination of the crisis in Europe, a UK economy likely to have a third successive quarter of negative growth in the three months to June, and tumbling inflation adds up to only one thing: more quantitative easing from the Bank next month.",

The Office for National Statistics said the annual inflation rate, measured on the consumer price index, slipped to 2.8% last month from 3% in April, as falling oil prices fed through to cheaper petrol at the pump. The ONS cited motor fuels as the biggest factor, with petrol prices falling by 4.5p a litre in a single month, to stand at \u00a31.37. During May, the cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil on international markets slipped from $120 to $103. It has since fallen further, to $83. On the retail price index measure, which also includes housing costs, inflation slipped to 3.1% in May from 3.5% a month earlier. Though inflation is still well above the Bank of England's target of 2%, the fall should help to reassure policymakers that they can take more action to stimulate the economy without sparking a renewed surge in prices. The Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, hinted in his Mansion House speech last week that the monetary policy committee could unleash a fresh bout of quantitative easing - electronic money creation - alongside the government's new measures for kickstarting credit. Jeremy Cook, of the currency broker World First, said the data \"will trigger a sigh of relief from Threadneedle St\" as it gives the Bank further leeway with possible further expansionary monetary policy, such as interest rate cuts or additional asset purchases.
