      "bodyText": "\u2018I was a manic Brownie,\u201d Helena Morrissey tells me, fiddling with the lacy cuffs on her dress. \u201cI collected a lot of badges.\u201d She has not let up since, and now has the kind of CV that leaves normal people needing a lie-down just from reading it. At 48, Morrissey oversees \u00a350bn of assets at Newton Investments, and has nine children ranging in age from six to 23. In her spare time, whenever that might be, she set up the 30 PerCent Club to fight for greater female representation on company boards. She is also a trustee at the Eve Appeal, which fundraises for gynaecological cancers, and she chairs the corporate board of the Royal Academy of Arts. Her day begins at 5am and ends at 11pm, and she lives in the kind of executive whirlwind where taxi journeys are primarily understood as a good opportunity to call the New York office. It\u2019s just as well her husband Richard is a Buddhist priest. She tells me that sometimes she sees him sitting on the sofa at home and assumes he\u2019s reading, but on closer inspection, he turns out to be meditating. (As the stay-at-home parent to so many children, you couldn\u2019t blame him for closing his eyes for the odd micro-nap.) She often finds herself working in the evenings, but the whole family gathers for a movie every Saturday night and gadgets are banned, otherwise \u201ceveryone starts texting each other\u201d. There are so many children, she says, that sometimes \u201cwe text each other from one room to another if you can\u2019t remember where you put somebody \u2026 to find out if they\u2019re upstairs, we just text them\u201d. I\u2019ve come to her office in Blackfriars to discuss the results of the fourth annual survey of women on boards, published on 25 March. It revealed that women now account for 23.5% of FTSE 100 board members, up from 12.5% in 2011. The change has been voluntary \u2013 albeit undertaken in the shadow of a government threat to impose quotas if female representation did not reach a quarter by the end of this year. Education secretary Nicky Morgan, who is also minister for women, is ecstatic about Morrissey\u2019s contribution. \u201cWomen like Helena Morrissey are an absolute inspiration,\u201d she says via email. \u201cShe is a role model to millions and a shining light of what can be achieved.\u201d As it happens, Morrissey is sanguine about not hitting that government target of 25% before the general election in May \u2013 she says it will encourage the next government to continue the monitoring process. And she is very happy that the threat of state intervention has receded: \u201cA quota is bad because you\u2019re just solving one injustice with another, really.\u201d On the surface, the success of the initiative is faintly mystifying. It is a fundamental tenet of feminism that its political objectives will not be achieved by approaching people in power and asking nicely. Yet that appears to be exactly what Morrissey has done. She describes setting up the 30 PerCent Club in 2010 and approaching a few FTSE 100 chairmen to raise the issue. \u201cThe usual conversation went along the lines of, \u2018Yeah, women have made a real difference to the boards I chair\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd obviously that\u2019s the key. It\u2019s their board, it\u2019s not me telling them that it would be better if the women are there. But they said the women make a huge difference \u2013 it\u2019s much better, a different dynamic completely; the men behave differently, the whole decision-making process is different. But we can\u2019t get enough women. The search community doesn\u2019t come up with candidates \u2026 there is gridlock.\u201d Inspired by those early successes, she started writing to every company in the FTSE 350. \u201cI started at A and I got down to HA for Hanson, and by then I was getting very bad responses from many of the people in the early part of the alphabet \u2013 quite vitriolic really.\u201d A typical response ran: \u201cThis is a women\u2019s issue. What\u2019s it got to do with me?\u201d From then on, she decided to make a purely business case for diversity, arguing that \u201cit\u2019s not a women\u2019s issue, it\u2019s an economic issue\u201d. Look at the bottom line, she argued. See how much better businesses do when they don\u2019t exclude great swathes of the potential talent pool. The debate about women on boards might seem a rarefied concern in the age of austerity \u2013 as Laurie Penny put it, it\u2019s hard to care about the glass ceiling when the basement is flooded. But it does illuminate three of the great anxieties of contemporary feminism. The first is how radical the movement should be: should we be asking for more women on boards, or for the abolition of boards altogether? The second is the balance between pragmatism and idealism: what do we lose by mincing up the argument for equality to make it more palatable for those in power? The third is a question of priorities. Why, I ask Helena Morrissey, should those of us who will never be asked to join a FTSE 100 board care about their composition? \u201cYou can go back to the financial crisis as evidence that having one type of person running companies didn\u2019t necessarily yield the best result,\u201d she counters. \u201cThere\u2019s also the fact that it is, I suppose, unfair.\u201d She believes that greater cognitive diversity \u2013 bringing in those with different life experiences and styles of thinking \u2013 helps prevent the \u201cgroup-think\u201d that causes companies to ignore warning signs and charge headlong into poor decisions. (The RBS directors whose decisions led to it needing a \u00a345bn bailout in 2008? Seventeen men and one woman.) Morrissey mentions an acquaintance at a real estate company who initially resisted the arguments of the 30 PerCent Club. A few months later he had changed his mind. \u201cHe said: \u2018We were about to do a big joint venture in China and we were really macho, wanted to sign on the bottom line, you know, give us a pen, this is so fantastic.\u2019 Then the one woman on the board at the 11th hour piped up: \u2018I\u2019m a bit worried about this risk.\u2019\u201d Morrissey\u2019s acquaintance and his colleagues were briefly irritated, but later concluded that the woman was right. \u201cShe was outside the group, and she brought a different mindset.\u201d It is also very odd, Morrissey says, when companies that market their products to women do not have one on the board. \u201cWhen I started, Mothercare was an all-male board, which was my great example of how out-of-touch the board must be.\u201d Now, she cites the shoe designer Jimmy Choo as one of the 23 remaining FTSE 250 boards without any female representation. Still, there are drawbacks to Morrissey\u2019s softly-softly approach. After the publication of the latest gender audit, Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy pointed out that the apparent gains in female representation are largely down to the appointment of more non-executive directors. There are now 239 of these on the boards of FTSE 100 companies, compared with just 24 female executive directors, and five female CEOs. The non-execs were, Creasy suggested, \u201cmaking up the numbers and not getting a chance to make the decisions\u201d. I put this to Morrissey. \u201cI\u2019m glad you asked this,\u201d she says brightly, giving every impression she actually is glad. \u201cDefinitely it was always going to be easier to appoint non-execs. You can have a much broader skillset to be a non-exec, whereas most companies only have two or three executive directors anyway, and so the CEO and the CFO usually take the two slots.\u201d She hopes, she says, for a \u201ctrickle-down\u201d effect. She is also conflicted about expanding the 30 Per Cent Club\u2019s focus beyond gender. A statement on the website reads: \u201cWe greeted the news that Vince Cable is to launch a drive to target 20% ethnic minorities on FTSE 100 boards by 2020 with mixed feelings. Setting more and more targets for companies, however well-intentioned, just leads to gridlock and possibly resentment.\u201d Surely, I ask her, if cognitive diversity is a good thing, then why not look for a greater racial and class mix on boards as well as more women? \u201cI am completely for other types of diversity,\u201d she replies. \u201cWomen is [sic] just very easy to measure, very easy to manage, and it breaks open the lid of the cosy club. Then the rest [follows].\u201d It comes back to her opposition to quotas: \u201cThe idea of having 30% women, 20% ethnic minority, presumably some per cent \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the number would be \u2013 of LGBT. I mean, it ends up \u2026 then you\u2019ll have to have a campaign for white men.\u201d Perhaps seeing my eyebrows shoot up, she adds in her usual fluent machine-gun delivery: \u201cIt\u2019s not a boyband. This is about a thoughtful board that comprises lots of different types of people, and the women issue has triggered bigger discussions.\u201d I confess myself to be agnostic on the idea that captains of industry will overlook chaps they bump into in the Garrick in favour of less-obvious candidates without a certain amount of external pressure. But Morrissey does make a good case that liberating women from stereotyped assumptions about their behaviour benefits the workforce as a whole. When she had her fourth child, her husband gave up work. \u201cHe said, \u2018I would like to go freelance and we would have a happier life if we were not both rushing out the door.\u2019 He says to me that the logical extension of all of this is that men have more choice as well.\u201d She adds that she recently asked her middle son \u2013 she has three sons and six daughters \u2013 what he wanted to do when he grew up, and he said: \u201cI thought I\u2019d stay at home like dad.\u201d Of course, to do that he will have to find a woman whose salary can pay the bills \u2013 very few families in Britain can now manage on a single income. For her part, Morrissey is well aware of the criticism that her message applies only to a privileged segment of the population. \u201cI\u2019m not really doing it for any kind of popularity contest, obviously,\u201d she says. \u201cOtherwise I probably wouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d She argues, however, that the way women suffer in business when they take maternity leave shows up how old-fashioned our working practices are. \u201cOur office can be so much more productive since I came back after my last child, six years ago, than it could after my first, 23 years ago. I mean, the internet didn\u2019t exist then, I knew nothing about what had gone on, apart from they\u2019d send me a pack.\u201d Morrissey hates being described as a \u201csuperwoman\u201d, but her conversation is peppered with anecdotes that remind you that the young, manic badge-collecting Brownie is still inside her. On her last maternity leave in 2009, for example, a manager resigned and she had to come into the office with her five-day-old baby in tow. \u201cAnd then I went home and everyone kind of kept me in the loop,\u201d she continues breezily. \u201cI checked through emails and we had telephone calls.\u201d When the interview finishes, the machine clicks into gear again \u2013 a child needs collecting from school, and with such a large family, keeping to schedule is vital. Although Morrissey\u2019s approach to equality is very different to mine, I respect that she has put her head above the parapet. After she leaves, I find myself wishing I had time to ask her about navigating femininity in a male-dominated world: she had earlier told me that she believes women and men are fundamentally different, and told Harper\u2019s Bazaar in 2013 that she always wears high heels. Then, unprompted, her PR adviser, Louisa, offers an unexpected defence: \u201cI came from another very male-dominated sector, and when I first arrived here, I wore a black trouser suit,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI was so surprised when I saw Helena. I thought: she\u2019s the CEO, and she dresses \u2026 like a woman.\u201d I had never thought of it that way: in a room full of pin-striped suits, a skirt and heels is discreetly defiant \u2013 much like Helena Morrissey herself.",

Look at the bottom line, she argued. See how much better businesses do when they don\u2019t exclude great swathes of the potential talent pool.</p> <p>The debate about women on boards might seem a rarefied concern in the age of austerity \u2013 as Laurie Penny put it, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2011/07/women-business-finance-power\">it\u2019s hard to care about the glass ceiling when the basement is flooded</a>. But it does illuminate three of the great anxieties of contemporary feminism. The first is how radical the movement should be: should we be asking for more women on boards, or for the abolition of boards altogether? The second is the balance between pragmatism and idealism: what do we lose by mincing up the argument for equality to make it more palatable for those in power? The third is a question of priorities. Why, I ask Helena Morrissey, should those of us who will never be asked to join a FTSE 100 board care about their composition?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfz1eK48k_k\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sfz1eK48k_k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cYou can go back to the financial crisis as evidence that having one type of person running companies didn\u2019t necessarily yield the best result,\u201d she counters. \u201cThere\u2019s also the fact that it is, I suppose, unfair.\u201d She believes that greater cognitive diversity \u2013 bringing in those with different life experiences and styles of thinking \u2013 helps prevent the \u201cgroup-think\u201d that causes companies to ignore warning signs and charge headlong into poor decisions. (The RBS directors whose decisions led to it needing a \u00a345bn bailout in 2008? Seventeen men and one woman.)</p> <p>Morrissey mentions an acquaintance at a real estate company who initially resisted the arguments of the 30 PerCent Club. A few months later he had changed his mind. \u201cHe said: \u2018We were about to do a big joint venture in China and we were really macho, wanted to sign on the bottom line, you know, give us a pen, this is so fantastic.\u2019 Then the one woman on the board at the 11th hour piped up: \u2018I\u2019m a bit worried about this risk.\u2019\u201d Morrissey\u2019s acquaintance and his colleagues were briefly irritated, but later concluded that the woman was right. \u201cShe was outside the group, and she brought a different mindset.\u201d</p> <p>It is also very odd, Morrissey says, when companies that market their products to women do not have one on the board. \u201cWhen I started, Mothercare was an all-male board, which was my great example of how out-of-touch the board must be.\u201d Now, she cites the shoe designer Jimmy Choo as one of the 23 remaining FTSE 250 boards without any female representation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/apr/18/helena-morrissey-big-challenge-below-boardroom\">Helena Morrissey: 'The big challenge is below the boardroom'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, there are drawbacks to Morrissey\u2019s softly-softly approach. After the publication of the latest gender audit, Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy pointed out that the <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/how-far-women-really-come-4970279\">apparent gains in female representation are largely down to the appointment of more non-executive directors</a>. There are now 239 of these on the boards of FTSE 100 companies, compared with just 24 female executive directors, and five female CEOs. The non-execs were, Creasy suggested, \u201cmaking up the numbers and not getting a chance to make the decisions\u201d.</p> <p>I put this to Morrissey. \u201cI\u2019m glad you asked this,\u201d she says brightly, giving every impression she actually is glad. \u201cDefinitely it was always going to be easier to appoint non-execs. You can have a much broader skillset to be a non-exec, whereas most companies only have two or three executive directors anyway, and so the CEO and the CFO usually take the two slots.\u201d</p> <p>She hopes, she says, for a \u201ctrickle-down\u201d effect. She is also conflicted about expanding the 30 Per Cent Club\u2019s focus beyond gender. A statement on the website reads: \u201cWe greeted the news that Vince Cable is to launch a drive <a href=\"http://30percentclub.org/2014/11/ethnic-minorities-on-boards/\">to target 20% ethnic minorities on FTSE 100 boards by 2020 with mixed feelings</a>. Setting more and more targets for companies, however well-intentioned, just leads to gridlock and possibly resentment.\u201d Surely, I ask her, if cognitive diversity is a good thing, then why not look for a greater racial and class mix on boards as well as more women?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62QkCJ3kJzU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/62QkCJ3kJzU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cI am completely for other types of diversity,\u201d she replies. \u201cWomen is [sic] just very easy to measure, very easy to manage, and it breaks open the lid of the cosy club. Then the rest [follows].\u201d It comes back to her opposition to quotas: \u201cThe idea of having 30% women, 20% ethnic minority, presumably some per cent \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the number would be \u2013 of LGBT. I mean, it ends up \u2026 then you\u2019ll have to have a campaign for white men.\u201d Perhaps seeing my eyebrows shoot up, she adds in her usual fluent machine-gun delivery: \u201cIt\u2019s not a boyband. This is about a thoughtful board that comprises lots of different types of people, and the women issue has triggered bigger discussions.\u201d</p> <p>I confess myself to be agnostic on the idea that captains of industry will overlook chaps they bump into in the Garrick in favour of less-obvious candidates without a certain amount of external pressure. But Morrissey does make a good case that liberating women from stereotyped assumptions about their behaviour benefits the workforce as a whole. When she had her fourth child, her husband gave up work.</p> <p>\u201cHe said, \u2018I would like to go freelance and we would have a happier life if we were not both rushing out the door.\u2019 He says to me that the logical extension of all of this is that men have more choice as well.\u201d She adds that she recently asked her middle son \u2013 she has three sons and six daughters \u2013 what he wanted to do when he grew up, and he said: \u201cI thought I\u2019d stay at home like dad.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/15/survey-women-careers-stall-30s\">Major survey plans to study why women's careers stall in their 30s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, to do that he will have to find a woman whose salary can pay the bills \u2013 very few families in Britain can now manage on a single income. For her part, Morrissey is well aware of the criticism that her message applies only to a privileged segment of the population. \u201cI\u2019m not really doing it for any kind of popularity contest, obviously,\u201d she says. \u201cOtherwise I probably wouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p> <p>She argues, however, that the way women suffer in business when they take maternity leave shows up how old-fashioned our working practices are. \u201cOur office can be so much more productive since I came back after my last child, six years ago, than it could after my first, 23 years ago. I mean, the internet didn\u2019t exist then, I knew nothing about what had gone on, apart from they\u2019d send me a pack.\u201d Morrissey hates being described as a \u201csuperwoman\u201d, but her conversation is peppered with anecdotes that remind you that the young, manic badge-collecting Brownie is still inside her. On her last maternity leave in 2009, for example, a manager resigned and she had to come into the office with her five-day-old baby in tow. \u201cAnd then I went home and everyone kind of kept me in the loop,\u201d she continues breezily. \u201cI checked through emails and we had telephone calls.\u201d</p> <p>When the interview finishes, the machine clicks into gear again \u2013 a child needs collecting from school, and with such a large family, keeping to schedule is vital. Although Morrissey\u2019s approach to equality is very different to mine, I respect that she has put her head above the parapet. After she leaves, I find myself wishing I had time to ask her about navigating femininity in a male-dominated world: she had earlier told me that she believes women and men are fundamentally different, and told Harper\u2019s Bazaar in 2013 that she always wears high heels.</p> <p>Then, unprompted, her PR adviser, Louisa, offers an unexpected defence: \u201cI came from another very male-dominated sector, and when I first arrived here, I wore a black trouser suit,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI was so surprised when I saw Helena. I thought: she\u2019s the CEO, and she dresses \u2026 like a woman.\u201d I had never thought of it that way: in a room full of pin-striped suits, a skirt and heels is discreetly defiant \u2013 much like Helena Morrissey herself.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With its preponderance of mining companies the UK market has lost ground as commodity prices fell back. But although the German and French stock exchanges ended the day higher, it was not enough to prevent their first weekly falls since January. A combination of concerns has unsettled investors, including Middle East tension, the uncertainty over Greece\u2019s finances and continuing speculation about a US rate rise despite signs of weakness in the country\u2019s economy. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 40.31 points or 0.58% higher at 6855.02 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.21% at 11,868.33 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.55% better at 5034.06 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.37% to 22,984.23 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.23% lower at 11,427.4 The Athens market added 0.5% to 768.67 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is treading water ahead of the latest comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, up just 4 points or 0.02%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Meanwhile Greece will be able to make pension and civil servants\u2019 salary payments due at the end of the month, the deputy finance minister for expenditure has told the Financial Times. Dimitris Mardas said: Whatever needs to be paid will be paid on time \u2014 that means wages, pensions and the subsidy to IKA (Greece\u2019s biggest health and social security fund). But the FT added: However, Mr Mardas could not give any assurances about a separate \u20ac450m payment to the International Monetary Fund due on April 9, which is overseen by a separate department within the ministry. Back with Greece, and it appears the brinkmanship continues: S&amp;P said: Although its economic prospects remain uncertain, Cyprus\u2019 budgetary consolidation has proceeded faster than we anticipated, contributing to a substantial decline in the government debt-to-GDP ratio from 2014, by our estimate. We now forecast average net general government debt over 2015-2017 for Cyprus at 91.8% of GDP, compared with 103.4% of GDP previously. The positive outlook reflects the possibility that we could raise our ratings. And here\u2019s something positive: Despite the discussions set to begin over Greek reforms, that has not stopped talk that the country might have to introduce capital controls: Although not the Greek press as it happens: The European Central Bank considers Greek banks to be solvent, according to the head of its supervisory arm Daniele Nouy, Reuters is reporting. And more details on the reforms themselves from Reuters: Greece\u2019s government has included measures to boost state revenues by \u20ac3bn this year as part of a list of reforms it is sending European creditors in the hope of unlocking aid, a government official said on Friday. The official said Athens\u2019s EU and IMF creditors, known as the Brussels group, will start discussing the list of Athens\u2019s proposed reforms on Saturday. \u201cThe actions proposed through the reforms list foresee revenues of \u20ac3bn for 2015 which will under no circumstances will come from wage or pension cuts,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe list does not include recessionary measures.\u201d The list estimates a primary budget surplus of 1.5% for 2015 - below the 3% target included in the country\u2019s existing EU/IMF bailout - and growth of 1.4%, the official said. Meanwhile here is Reuter\u2019s take on the next steps for Greece now the reform list has been sent: Greece and the institutions representing its official creditors will start discussions on a list of economic reforms submitted by Athens on Friday evening, a euro zone official said. Asked to confirm that Athens had sent a list with reform proposals to representatives of the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the euro zone bailout fund ESM, the official said: \u201cYes, they did. And tonight the talks between the Greek government and the institutions will start.\u201d And here\u2019s a response to the rumours of Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s resignation as Greek finance minister (see earlier) from the man himself: 27-Mar-2015 15:23 - GREECE SENT IN A REFORM LIST FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH CREDITORS, TALKS BETWEEN GREECE AND CREDITOR INSTITUTIONS START TONIGHT-EURO ZONE OFFICIAL Seems Greece has now sent the list of reforms, and here are some Reuters snaps on the contents: 27-Mar-2015 15:21 - GREEK GOVT PRESENTED MEASURES TO BOOST GOVT REVENUES BY 3 BLN EUROS IN 2015 AS PART OF REFORMS LIST - GOVT OFFICIAL 27-Mar-2015 15:22 - GREEK GOVT REFORMS LIST ESTIMTES PRIMARY BUDGET SURPLUS OF 1.5 PCT FOR 2015G - GOVT OFFICIAL 27-Mar-2015 15:23 - GREEK REFORMS LIST ESTIMATES 2015 GDP GROWTH AT 1.4 PCT -GOVT OFFICIAL 27-Mar-2015 15:23 - BRUSSELS GROUP TO START DISCUSSING GREEK REFORMS LIST ON SATURDAY - GOVT OFFICIAL Greece is set to send its long awaited list of reforms to its eurozone and IMF lenders later today. The list needs to be approved before Athens is given a new tranche of aid to avert a financial crisis. It is expected to include measures to improve investor sentiment, boost tax revenues and judicial reform, according to Reuters, but there is little further detail yet. And up until now, reforms proposed by the Greek government under Alexis Tsipras, have not been detailed enough to pass muster. And Euclid Tsakalotos, minister for international economic affairs, said Greece wanted a positive outcome but warned of a clash with its creditors if the list of reforms was not accepted. He said (from Reuters): We support the people that have lost a lot as a result of the crisis and we are prepared, if things do not go well, for a clash... They [our partners] must know that we are prepared for a falling out, otherwise you don\u2019t negotiate. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index picked was revised up for March to 93 in March from an earlier 91.2. Economists were forecasting a smaller improvement to 92. Despite the upward revision, consumers were less upbeat in March than they were in February, when the index was 95.4. Richard Curtin, an economist working on the survey at the university: The harsh winter weather and the small rebound in gas prices caused some slippage in consumer confidence since the start of the year. Importantly, most of the recent variation was among lower income households, whose budgets are more sensitive to higher utility costs and disruptions in work hours. Households with incomes in the middle and top thirds of the distribution, in contrast, recorded gains in confidence in the March survey. Expanding job opportunities as well as more favorable wage gains have meant that consumer spending will rebound during the balance of the year. While there is a widespread expectation that interest rates will begin to rise later in the year, few consumers anticipated that the size of the increases will dampen their credit sensitive purchase plans. Breaking: US consumer sentiment beats expectations Oil prices have fallen further... Brent crude is down more than a cent or 2.5% at $57.72 a barrel. It hasn\u2019t reversed all of Thursday\u2019s decline though, after prices 4% over fears that fighting Saudi air strikes in Yemen would lead to a broader crisis in the Middle East. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that workers at the European Central Bank are suffering from stress because of understaffing. Almost 5% of workers who responded to a staff survey \u201chave reported having suicidal thoughts and/or hurting themselves,\u201d according to a letter sent by the IPSO union to the 19 national central bank governors on the ECB\u2019s governing council, and seen by the WSJ. Here is an extract from the story: The union that represents workers at the European Central Bank has said that acute understaffing at the institution is leading to employee burnout. In a letter to the 19 national central bank governors on the ECB\u2019s governing council and seen by The Wall Street Journal, the IPSO union claims that nearly one-third of the central bank\u2019s staff is \u201cat risk of burnout.\u201d Nearly 5% of respondents to a staff survey \u201chave reported having suicidal thoughts and/or hurting themselves,\u201d according to the letter. The burnout level is probably about twice the normal level in the general population, the union said. The ECB declined to comment on Friday. The data come from a survey of a little more than 900 staff carried out by a consulting firm on behalf of the workers\u2019 council at the ECB. The ECB employed 2,344 employees on either permanent or fixed-term contracts as of the end of last year. The letter said that the ECB hadn\u2019t adequately staffed its new role as the eurozone\u2019s banking supervisor, which is leading to a steady stream of frustration from both bank employees and managers. The union \u201cdenounce[s] with the utmost vigour, the situation of serious understaffing and excessive work pressure within the [ECB bank supervisor]; a situation that results in a constant flow of complaints from staff and management alike.\u201d US stock markets have opened roughly flat. Dow Jones: +0.1% at 17,698.05 Nasdaq: +0.3% at 4,327.12 S&amp;P 500: flat at 2,056 Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, has been speaking at the Bundesbank conference in Frankfurt. In my view, expansionary monetary policy and high leverage are not the solution but the main causes of the financial and debt crises of recent years. Probably not a fan of the European Central Bank\u2019s \u20ac1.1 trillion quantitative easing programme then... US Commerce Department figures showing annual growth of 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014 confirm a slowdown compared with the third quarter, when GDP increased by 5%. The department said in a statement: The deceleration in real GDP growth in the fourth quarter primarily reflected an upturn in imports, a downturn in federal government spending, a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment, and a larger decrease in private inventory investment that were partly offset by accelerations in PCE [personal consumption expenditures] and in state and local government spending. Breaking: US annual growth for the fourth quarter has been left unrevised at 2.2%, disappointing expectations of an upward revision to 2.4%. Revised figures for US fourth-quarter growth will be published at 12.30 UK time. Economists polled by Reuters expect annual growth to be revised up to 2.4% from a previous estimate, driven higher by consumer spending. Germany has no details yet about the latest plans for Greek reforms, a spokeswoman for the German finance ministry said. Marianne Kothe: We have had no concrete information presented to us. She added eurozone finance ministers would only meet once documents had been presented to them. Reuters has filed a fuller report on the earlier speculation that Yanis Varoufakis is planning to quit the Greek government (which has been denied by officials) Greece\u2019s outspoken Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis is not planning to resign, two Greek government officials said on Friday, denying a report in Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper. \u201cNone of this is true, it\u2019s far from reality,\u201d one of the officials told Reuters. Bild\u2019s online version on Friday cited a Greek government source as saying it was only a matter of time before Varoufakis resigned, adding that such a decision had already been made. A prominent figure in the Greek government who made a habit of being interviewed frequently and making a media splash with sharp-tongued attacks against austerity, Varoufakis has kept a markedly lower profile in recent days. After a celebrity photo shoot with his wife for Paris Match magazine angered officials from the ruling Syriza party, Varoufakis has appeared on fewer television shows and reduced the number of interviews he gives. He also cancelled an appearance at a London conference last week and was notably absent when Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras travelled to Brussels and then Berlin for crucial talks on Greece\u2019s efforts to secure financial aid to keep afloat. The 53-year-old academic economist had never held a political position until Tsipras tapped him to become finance minister in January. His unabashed criticism of a hated bailout programme and his casual, untucked shirt and tie-less style has since given him rock star status in Greece. But he has also alienated many of his euro zone peers and has been involved in a public war of words with his powerful German counterpart, Wolfgang Schaeuble, raising concerns about whether he was hampering rather than helping talks to secure aid. Austrian Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling has said eurozone finances ministers are struggling to have faith in Greece amid chaotic decision-making. He told reporters in Vienna: We have a crisis of confidence with Greece. Something is decided every day and on the next day it doesn\u2019t apply any more. Commenting on the possibility of a debt haircut for Greece, he added: You can easily calculate this: it brings nothing. [The Greek problem] will occupy us for some time. I don\u2019t know what will emerge. He said a haircut would not ease Greece\u2019s budget problems and was no solution to its fiscal woes. The Greek government is expected to produce detailed economic reform proposals on Monday. The challenge is to convince its lenders that it is acting responsibly, and therefore deserves another tranche of funding before the money really does run out. A Greek government official has denied reports that finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is planning to resign. An official told Reuters: None of this is true, it\u2019s far from reality. Twitter rumour: Greece\u2019s finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is considering resignation. We stress this is a rumour, which appears to have originated in Germany paper Bild. The briefest of comments from Mark Carney on interest rates has pushed the pound up against the dollar. The pound rose to $1.4860 from around $1.4818 after the Bank of England\u2019s governor said the next move in rates would be up. Back in Frankfurt, the Bank of England\u2019s governor Mark Carney, is reinforcing the point that UK households should prepare for a rise in interest rates (despite Andy Haldane\u2019s comments). The next move in interest rates is likely up. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England and a member of its interest-rate setting Monetary Policy Committee, has waded into the UK deflation debate. Broadbent has become the latest in a string of MPC members to argue that the risk of a dangerous, protracted spell of UK deflation is low. Instead - the argument goes - UK inflation will begin to pick up again and the next move in rates will be up, not down. UK inflation is at a record low of zero, and expected to turn negative in the coming months as falling food and petrol prices, as well as lower energy bills, feed through. Divisions have emerged at the very top of the Bank over what this might mean in the coming months. MPC members Mark Carney, Minouche Shafik, Kristin Forbes, David Miles and now Broadbent have played down the prospect of another rate cut. Their interventions followed a warning last week by Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist and fellow MPC member, who suggested the risk of a deflationary spiral was being underestimated by the Bank. As such, he said, the next move in rates could be down. Rates are already at an all-time low of 0.5%. Speaking at Imperial College Business School in London on Friday, Broadbent said low inflation in the UK at the moment was the \u201cgood\u201d kind, not the dangerous kind. Real interest rates still need to be low. Our inflation target is 2% not zero: what makes the current position \u201cgood\u201d is not low inflation per se but the fact that, in this particular instance, it\u2019s been caused by something (a drop in oil prices) that improves real incomes. Even though the direct effect of that decline will drop out of the annual comparison later this year and in early 2016, there\u2019s a risk that, by depressing wage growth, sub-target inflation could persist for longer than we expect. My own view, however, is that the likelihood of a broad and protracted deflation, afflicting wages as well as prices, is pretty low. My guess is that, with the financial system improving, and signs that the worst fears about the global economy may be subsiding, the neutral real interest rate is more likely to rise than fall over the next couple of years. Over that period, headline inflation will get a sizeable kick upwards, once the falls in food and energy prices drop out of the annual comparison. In the meantime, the UK labour market continues to tighten \u2013 low inflation won\u2019t be the only influence on pay growth this year \u2013 and the boost imparted by lower commodity prices to real incomes is already apparent in higher consumer spending, here and in other countries too. Finally, history tells us these episodes are rare \u2013 rare, in the case of developed countries with floating exchange rates, almost to the point of uniqueness. With his international hat on, as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, Carney is speaking about the quest to end \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d among global banks. Progress is being made. It\u2019s imperative that we finish this off this year. Mark Carney\u2019s panel has started. He is introduced by the moderator as \u201ca top figure in the financial world\u201d. Carney is asked how concerned he is about high levels of global debt. Using the UK as an an example, he says that the concern is not about households defaulting - \u201cUK households pay their debts\u201d - but about households having to pay out so much to service their debt. That\u2019s why we have used macro prudential tools as an insurance policy to limit that. While we\u2019re waiting for Mark Carney\u2019s panel to start in Frankfurt, an update from the UK\u2019s housing market. The annual rate of house price growth slowed for a seventh month in March, to 5.1%. That - according to the Nationwide index - compares with a recent peak of 11.8% in June 2014. The average price of a UK home is now 2% above its pre-crisis peak, at \u00a3189,454. Over the month of March, prices rose by 0.1%. The Guardian\u2019s full story is here. Following a sell-off in European markets on Thursday, and a 0.95% fall in the Nikkei overnight, investors are a little more upbeat this morning. The FTSE 100 is down slightly, 0.1% lower at 6,888.62, but markets are up elsewhere. France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,023.67 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.6% at 11,915.5 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 11,489.9 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 22,980.33 Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, will be speaking on a panel at the Bundesbank conference from around 8.45am (UK time). The live feed is here and we will be following it. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, German finance minister will also be speaking at the conference this afternoon. Over in Frankfurt, the head of Germany\u2019s central bank and a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, has been warning on unsustainable debt levels in the eurozone. Speaking at a Bundesbank conference, Jens Weidmann said: In the euro area we are already in the danger zone - at least with regard to public debt standing at 91% and corporate debt at 105%. Household debt currently stands at 62%. Sovereign debt needs to be backed by capital, and exposure to a single sovereign must be capped, just as is the case for any private debtor. You can read the full speech here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oil prices are falling again after the absence of fresh developments in Yemen eased fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East. Brent crude is down 1.7% at $58.17 this morning, following a 4% jump in Thursday trading. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says Tuesday\u2019s spike followed patterns we\u2019ve seen before. The spike in oil prices caused by the Saudi military incursions into Yemen, has all the hallmarks of a classic knee jerk market reaction to a new flashpoint. We saw similar spikes last year with Ukraine, Libya and ISIS pushing into Iraq before markets settled back down again, and it is likely that these concerns about Yemen could follow a similar pattern, as long as there is no significant disruption through the straits between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. Read our full story on how Saudi-led air strikes on the Yemeni capital, Sana\u2019a, and the southern port city of Aden , affected markets on Thursday.",

Instead - the argument goes - UK inflation will begin to pick up again and the next move in rates will be up, not down.</p> <p>UK inflation is at a record low of zero, and expected to turn negative in the coming months as falling food and petrol prices, as well as lower energy bills, feed through.</p> <p>Divisions have emerged at the very top of the Bank over what this might mean in the coming months. MPC members Mark Carney, Minouche Shafik, Kristin Forbes, David Miles and now Broadbent have played down the prospect of another rate cut.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/25/bank-of-england-plays-down-prospect-of-interest-rate-cut\"><strong>Their interventions </strong></a>followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/19/interest-rates-may-be-cut-suggests-bank-of-england-chief-economist\"><strong>a warning last week by Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist and fellow MPC member</strong></a>, who suggested the risk of a deflationary spiral was being underestimated by the Bank. As such, he said, the next move in rates could be down. Rates are already at an all-time low of 0.5%.</p> <p>Speaking at Imperial College Business School in London on Friday, Broadbent said low inflation in the UK at the moment was the \u201cgood\u201d kind, not the dangerous kind.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Real interest rates still need to be low. Our inflation target is 2% not zero: what makes the current position \u201cgood\u201d is not low inflation per se but the fact that, in this particular instance, it\u2019s been caused by something (a drop in oil prices) that improves real incomes.</p> <p>Even though the direct effect of that decline will drop out of the annual comparison later this year and in early 2016, there\u2019s a risk that, by depressing wage growth, sub-target inflation could persist for longer than we expect. </p> <p>My own view, however, is that the likelihood of a broad and protracted deflation, afflicting wages as well as prices, is pretty low. <br></p> <p>My guess is that, with the financial system improving, and signs that the worst fears about the global economy may be subsiding, the neutral real interest rate is more likely to rise than fall over the next couple of years. </p> <p>Over that period, headline inflation will get a sizeable kick upwards, once the falls in food and energy prices drop out of the annual comparison. </p> <p>In the meantime, the UK labour market continues to tighten \u2013 low inflation won\u2019t be the only influence on pay growth this year \u2013 and the boost imparted by lower commodity prices to real incomes is already apparent in higher consumer spending, here and in other countries too. </p> <p>Finally, history tells us these episodes are rare \u2013 rare, in the case of developed countries with floating exchange rates, almost to the point of uniqueness. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-03-27T09:41:38.510Z\">at 9.41am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55151f8fe4b0cbe13ce32051\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-27T09:18:50.403Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With his international hat on, as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, Carney is speaking about the quest to end \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d among global banks.

The pharmaceuticals group paid $5.2bn for US rare disease specialist NPS Pharma earlier this year, and there was a report it could now be eyeing up BioMarin, a specialist in rare genetic diseases worth around $18bn. Citigroup said in a morning comment that a deal \u201cstrategically makes sense but [is] unlikely.\u201d Meanwhile UBS raised its target price on Shire from \u00a354 to \u00a360, dismissing suggestions the company had paid too much for NPS. UBS analyst Guillaume van Renterghem said: The price Shire paid to acquire NPS ($5.2bn) led a few investors to wonder whether Shire had not overpaid for it. To answer this question we conducted two proprietary surveys on Natpara and Gattex in the US and reached the conclusion that these compound combined could be worth $9bn on an net present value basis. Indeed, both drugs target high medical need with a high portion of patients needing alternative therapies. Pricing and patient-specific efficacy remains an issue to physicians but the overall response remains positive for both drugs. Shire shares are currently 55p higher at \u00a353.65.",

    "webTitle": "Co-op Bank could pay boss \u00a35m package as losses halve", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the troubled Co-operative Bank is being handed a potential \u00a35m pay deal, sparking a row as he prepares to axe more jobs and close another swath of branches. Niall Booker, hired in the midst of the 2013 crisis, has been handed the higher pay deal, a rise of up to \u00a31.9m to sign him up until the end of 2016 to help restore the loss-making bank\u2019s fortunes. One expert on mutual businesses said it was not ethical to pay management \u201clike Premier League footballers\u201d. Even though losses were more than halved in 2014, Booker said the lender would be lossmaking for at least another two years and that another 57 branch closures would be required on top of 72 last year when 993 jobs were lost. The Co-op will be left with a network of 165 branches and another 61 roles will be lost. Booker, who was paid \u00a33.1m last year, said:\u201cWe are in the early stages of the turnaround and there is still much to do to transform the organisation into a sustainable business\u201d. His new pay deal, to keep him untilat least until 31 December 2016, could amount to \u00a34.97m this year and \u00a34.5m in 2016, and sparked controversy. He was part of the turnaround team hired by the Co-op Group chief executive Euan Sutherland \u2013 who then walked out after details of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal were leaked. The Co-op Group owned the bank until 2013 when it was rescued by bondholders, led by US hedge funds, leaving the UK\u2019s largest mutual with a minority stake of 20%. Peter Hunt, a managing partner at Mutuo, an advisory consultancy to mutually owned businesses, said: \u201cCo-op members will be shocked and angered by this. Having already paid the price of the bank\u2019s near-collapse, they are helpless bystanders as executive pay spirals away from reality. Ordinary staff have lost their jobs whilst top management are being paid as Premier League footballers. It\u2019s not ethical and it\u2019s certainly not cooperative.\u201d Unions were also critical. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cExcessive executive pay is an ongoing problem across the banking sector, where remuneration expectations need bringing back down to earth. The leadership culture in banking has to change to one of stewardship, rather than one of cashing in.\u201d Deborah Hargreaves, the director of the High Pay Centre, said the deal was \u201cway over the top\u201d. \u201cThe Co-op is a bank that trades on its ethical values, yet it is paying a package that compares favourably with the high street banks. Maybe it doesn\u2019t realise that its customers would also expect ethics to apply to pay,\u201d she said. Dennis Holt, the bank\u2019s chairman, said Booker\u2019s pay last year was set \u201cagainst very stretching targets\u201d. The former senior Lloyds banker said a bigger proportion of Booker\u2019s package was now dependent on meeting performance targets. His basic salary rises to \u00a31.3m from \u00a31.2m and he will be entitled to a bonus of up to \u00a31.25m this year. The Manchester-based lender made a loss before tax of \u00a3264.2m in 2014, compared with a \u00a3632.8m loss the year before. The 2013 figure was revised from a \u00a31.3bn loss because of a \u00a3688.3m gain to the value of debt. Charges for misconduct and legal issues, including the mis-selling of payment protection insurance, fell to \u00a3101.2m last year, from \u00a3411.5m in 2013. It paid out \u00a38.3m in pay and bonuses to senior management last year, down from \u00a39.5m in 2013. Asset sales, including a \u00a37bn portfolio of buy-to-let mortgages it acquired as part of its ill-fated merger with the Britannia Building Society, will now be sped up. The mortgage book will be sold in batches to improve the lender\u2019s capital position. It was the only UK bank of eight high street lenders to fail a \u201cstress test\u201d set by Britain\u2019s financial watchdog last year. The bank said the performance of its core business stabilised in the second half of last year. The number of current accounts fell by 66,000, or 4%, over the year to 1.4m, but all of them were lost in the first half. Booker pointed to signs of a turnaround. The bank gained 1,000 primary current account customers - those who pay in their salary - between the first and the second half of 2014, taking the total to 651,000. The new mobile app launched a year ago now has more than 275,000 active users. He is aiming to turn the bank around after it was ordered to fill a capital shortfall and its former chairman, Paul Flowers, was fined for drug possession last year. The Co-op Group has been forced to delay its results by a week to incorporate the bank figures.",

In a release issued on Friday, the Australian privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, said he had been concerned by Optus\u2019s privacy practices following three privacy-related incidents, and began an investigation into Optus in July 2014. He said he had accepted an enforceable undertaking from Optus that it would seek to enhance its information security through a review. The revelations come just a day after the Senate passed a two-year mandatory data retention law that will see certain types of phone and web records held by telecommunications companies, including Optus. Pilgrim said: \u201cI appreciate the positive way in which Optus worked with our office to address these incidents. I consider that the enforceable undertaking is an appropriate outcome that will ensure Optus takes steps to strengthen its privacy controls and meet its security obligations under the Privacy Act.\u201d Optus has made an undertaking to complete a broad review of its information-handling practices.

Quick recap: in search of flattering headlines, the regulator overbriefed a story to the Telegraph and watched as insurers\u2019 share prices plunged. It took until the next afternoon for the FCA to clarify its modest ambitions. It was merely looking to see if there was a problem with exit fees on old insurance policies, rather than taking action that might whack insurers\u2019 profits. In effect, the FCA created a false market, the very sin it is meant to prevent others committing. The question now is whether the FCA has learned its lessons and digested the findings of an outside lawyer from Clifford Chance. Andrew Tyrie\u2019s Treasury select committee has doubts: \u201cIt is not clear that the FCA has yet fully grasped the extent of the failings revealed by Simon Davis\u2019s report.\u201d That will sting. The committee is demanding that the board of the FCA commission a review of its own effectiveness. Together with other measures, it calls this \u201can examination of whether the FCA is suffering from a systemic weakness in standards and culture\u201d. In plain English, MPs want evidence that the FCA is up to the job. That seems fair. A suspicious subplot to the saga was the FCA\u2019s bizarre decision to unveil its strategic restructuring two days before the Davis report was published last December. Clive Adamson, head of supervision, and press chief Zitah McMillan \u2013 two people criticised by Davis \u2013 left the FCA but the regulator denied their exits were related to the affair. As the MPs\u2019 report says, it looked like another \u201ccontrived media-handling operation\u201d to create the impression that the pair were being blamed while claiming otherwise. The FCA\u2019s timing was either cack-handed or petulant. The best remedy is to ensure the external review is thorough and professional. FCA chairman John Griffith-Jones should appoint somebody who is properly independent and experienced and may say more things the regulator doesn\u2019t like. Financial regulation is a serious business and a full health-check is legitimate. Uncharted waters for Lloyd\u2019s There are two ways \u2013 both legitimate \u2013 to view the same-again profit of \u00a33.2bn recorded by the Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market in 2014. First, this was another impressive result in the face of stiff competition. Second, a return on capital of 14.7% feels fragile. On the first point, Lloyd\u2019s deserves credit, even in a benign year for natural catastrophes. It successfully walked the thin line between chasing growth in new markets and retaining underwriting discipline. Lloyd\u2019s is opening new offices around the globe, from China to Mexico, but gross written premiums were actually a smidgeon lower than in 2013. That suggests some business is being turned away as too risky. Indeed, Lloyd\u2019s reckons its combined ratio (how much premium income is paid out in claims and expenses) of 88.1% was five percentage points better than its peers\u2019. Jolly good, but underwriting discipline offers only partial protection when natural disasters come in droves. The last really bad year was 2011, which brought floods in Thailand and Australia, the New Zealand earthquake and the Japanese tsunami. That year Lloyd\u2019s lost \u00a3500m, a reasonable outcome in the circumstances. Would it cope so well today? On current form, it would do better than competitors and the capital position is robust. But the worry in this industry is that risk is being severely mispriced in a low-interest world. Hedge funds and others, attracted by the sight of double-digit returns, are piling into the insurance market and driving premiums lower, or keeping them low. It is the job of Lloyd\u2019s bosses to sound cautious. But chief executive Inga Beale\u2019s remarks should be taken seriously. She said \u201cthe consensus is that prices need to rise to reflect increased exposures and risks in the market and the pressures on investment income.\u201d But then she said this probably won\u2019t happen: \u201cExcess capital and intense competition make broad-based price increases unlikely.\u201d Quantitative easing has blown many bubbles in financial markets. Specialist insurance and reinsurance may be one. Alliance hangs on, barely It\u2019s still early days in the punch-up between Alliance Trust and Elliott, the activist New York hedge fund that has proposed three non-executives to the board of the Dundee-based investment trust. But let\u2019s hope the argument doesn\u2019t become too bogged down in investment performance statistics. Alliance hasn\u2019t been great over three or five years, but it\u2019s improving. What shareholders really want to know is if Elliott is really trying to exit its holding by forcing a tender offer above Alliance\u2019s share price. Instead of grumbling about \u201chighly personal attacks,\u201d the hedge fund should provide clarity.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority made serious errors last year over the handling of of review of the life insurance industry, according to a report by a committee of MPs, which questions whether the City regulator is suffering from a systemic weakness in its culture. In its last report before parliament is dissolved for the general election, the Treasury select committee said the City regulator had lost sight of its objective to make sure markets work well and had not acknowledged the problems in the way it operates. The committee\u2019s findings are the latest development in the fallout from a briefing to the Daily Telegraph in March 2014 about its plans to review the life insurance industry. That briefing wiped \u00a33bn off the value of insurance company shares and sparked a furious reaction from the major insurers that the FCA regulates. The FCA breached its own rules \u2013 by allowing a false market in shares to be created \u2013 by waiting until 2.27pm on Friday 28 March to issue a clarifying statement on the Telegraph\u2019s report, which had appeared at 10pm the previous night. The FCA would have fined a firm which had behaved in the same way, the MPs said. \u201cThe FCA made a serious error in March last year. By breaching its own listing rules, it created a false market in life insurance shares. In doing so it put its own statutory objectives at risk. The evidence from this episode suggests that problems may still exist at the FCA. It is not yet clear to the committee that the FCA has fully grasped this,\u201d said Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee. A report by Clifford Chance lawyer Simon Davis, published in December by the FCA, found the regulators\u2019 strategy for dealing with the media was high risk and lacked control. The select committee accuses the FCA board of a \u201cmisjudgment\u201d in not immediately ensuring that the report by Davis was independent, and said Davis made a mistake in allowing his entire report to be seen by the FCA board \u2013 chaired by John Griffith-Jones. The FCA said it accepted the criticism in the Davis report and admitted it fell short of the standards expected of it. \u201cThe FCA is determined to learn the lessons and ensure that this will never happen again and will study the committee\u2019s recommendations and respond in due course,\u201d the regulator said. Tyrie said the two executives who received the most criticism in the report by Davis were Zitah McMillan, head of communications, and Clive Adamson, director of supervision. \u201cYet their departures from the organisation, announced by the FCA two days before the publication of the Davis Report, were presented as being unrelated to the incident. \u201cThis might reasonably lead to suspicions that Mr Adamson and Ms McMillan were being made to take the blame in a contrived media-handling operation for the mishandled pre-briefing, while allowing the FCA to claim that this was not the case,\u201d Tyrie said. The committee\u2019s report said there was concern that Martin Wheatley, the boss of the FCA, did not accept that the FCA\u2019s communications strategy was to blame for the fallout in the market the day after the report about the insurance review appeared. The committee said the events in March were a self-inflicted distraction for the FCA and called on the regulator to examine its communication methods, conduct an external review of its effectiveness and set out where senior responsibility lies. \u201cIt is not clear that the FCA has yet fully grasped the extent of the failings revealed by Simon Davis\u2019s report,\u201d the committee said, adding its recommendations were \u201can examination of whether the FCA is suffering from a systemic weakness in standards and culture\u201d.",

      "body": "<p> The Financial Conduct Authority made serious errors last year over the handling of of review of the life insurance industry, according to a report by a committee of MPs, which questions whether the City regulator is suffering from a systemic weakness in its culture.</p> <p>In its last report before parliament is dissolved for the general election, the Treasury select committee said the City regulator had lost sight of its objective to make sure markets work well and had not acknowledged the problems in the way it operates.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s findings are the latest development in the fallout from <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/10728440/Savers-locked-into-rip-off-pensions-and-investments-may-be-free-to-exit-regulators-will-say.html\">a briefing to the Daily Telegraph in March 2014</a> about its plans to review the life insurance industry. That briefing wiped \u00a33bn off the value of insurance company shares and sparked a furious reaction from the major insurers that the FCA regulates.</p> <p>The FCA breached its own rules \u2013 by allowing a false market in shares to be created \u2013 by waiting until 2.27pm on Friday 28 March to issue a clarifying statement on the Telegraph\u2019s report, which had appeared at 10pm the previous night. The FCA would have fined a firm which had behaved in the same way, the MPs said. </p> <p>\u201cThe FCA made a serious error in March last year. By breaching its own listing rules, it created a false market in life insurance shares. In doing so it put its own statutory objectives at risk. The evidence from this episode suggests that problems may still exist at the FCA. It is not yet clear to the committee that the FCA has fully grasped this,\u201d said Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee.</p> <p>A report by Clifford Chance lawyer Simon Davis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/10/fca-chiefs-lose-bonuses-botched-life-insurance-briefing\">published in December by the FCA</a>, found the regulators\u2019 strategy for dealing with the media was high risk and lacked control. The select committee accuses the FCA board of a \u201cmisjudgment\u201d in not immediately ensuring that the report by Davis was independent, and said Davis made a mistake in allowing his entire report to be seen by the FCA board \u2013 chaired by John Griffith-Jones.</p> <p>The FCA said it accepted the criticism in the Davis report and admitted it fell short of the standards expected of it. \u201cThe FCA is determined to learn the lessons and ensure that this will never happen again and will study the committee\u2019s recommendations and respond in due course,\u201d the regulator said.</p> <p>Tyrie said the two executives who received the most criticism in the report by Davis were Zitah McMillan, head of communications, and Clive Adamson, director of supervision. \u201cYet their departures from the organisation, announced by the FCA two days before the publication of the Davis Report, were presented as being unrelated to the incident. </p> <p>\u201cThis might reasonably lead to suspicions that Mr Adamson and Ms McMillan were being made to take the blame in a contrived media-handling operation for the mishandled pre-briefing, while allowing the FCA to claim that this was not the case,\u201d Tyrie said.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s report said there was concern that Martin Wheatley, the boss of the FCA, did not accept that the FCA\u2019s communications strategy was to blame for the fallout in the market the day after the report about the insurance review appeared. </p> <p>The committee said the events in March were a self-inflicted distraction for the FCA and called on the regulator to examine its communication methods, conduct an external review of its effectiveness and set out where senior responsibility lies. </p> <p>\u201cIt is not clear that the FCA has yet fully grasped the extent of the failings revealed by Simon Davis\u2019s report,\u201d the committee said, adding its recommendations were \u201can examination of whether the FCA is suffering from a systemic weakness in standards and culture\u201d.</p>",
