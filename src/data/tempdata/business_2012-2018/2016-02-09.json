      "bodyText": "It\u2019s only Tuesday, but many investors may feel they need a break after two days of dramatic swings. But instead, they need to get ready for Wednesday - when Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, will testify to Congress. America\u2019s top central banker can expect a lot of questions about the financial markets and the global economy. Especially as some investors think the Fed is going to cut interest rates this year, having only just raised them in December. Here\u2019s a quick recap of today\u2019s events. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has fallen to a three-year low. The blue-chip index lost 1%, or 57 points, to 5632. Mining shares led the rout, with Anglo American losing 11%, as fears of a global recession keep swirling. After a turbulent session, Wall Street has closed pretty flat tonight. The Dow finished down just 12 points, with consumer goods, healthcare and industrial stocks rallying. But as Marketwatch reports, there is a lot of angst out there: \u201cThe fear is palpable,\u201d said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management, pointing to the heightened volatility in the stock market. \u201cYou feel smart for three seconds and then you get humbled again.\u201d Oil has stumbled. Brent crude has lost 2% to $30.79 per barrel, while US crude dropped below $29/barrel. Deutsche Bank is in the eye of the storm, buffeted by fears over its financial strength. The FT is reporting tonight that Deutsche is considering buying back several billion euros of its debt, to shore up its value. But it\u2019s not clear that will stem concerns over Deutsche\u2019s CoCo debt, which could default if the crisis worsens. The turmoil actually began 15 hours ago, when Japan\u2019s Nikkei index suffered its biggest one-day drop in three years. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow to pick up all the action again. Thanks for reading, and all the comments. Goodnight! GW One late story breaking... Disney has just announced record quarterly earnings for the last three months. The entertainment company made $1.73 per share, beating forecasts of $1.45 per share. And it attributed the success to the new Star Wars film, The Force Awakens. Disney says: Driven by the phenomenal success of Star Wars, we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in the history of our company. It\u2019s over.... And after a lively Shrove Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average has closed as flat as a pancake. After being down 145 points, then up 100 points, the Dow finished down just 12 points. The S&amp;P 500 was also unchanged, while the Nasdaq dropped by 0.36%. Healthcare , materials, and biotech firms did well today, but energy stocks were kicked again, as concerns over global growth continue to mount. And New York still remained nervous, given the widespread worries about the global economy. As Steven Baffico, chief executive officer at Four Wood Capital Partners in New York, put it: It\u2019s difficult to find a lot of momentum to the upside for any sustained period of time. The US stock market appears to be recovering its nerve.... With an hour to go until the closing bell, US retail giant Home Depot is leading the Dow Jones industrial average, by gaining 1.6%. Famous names such as Nike, Visa, McDonald\u2019s and Coca-Cola have also turned green, as Wall Street traders regain their nerve after a couple of wild sessions. But other companies are still sliding. Energy group Chevron is leading the Dow fallers, shedding 3.5%, mirroring the slump in the oil price today. IT giant IBM are also down, reflecting losses across the tech sector. Here\u2019s the risers and fallers on the Dow, which is now up 46 points or 0.3%. Remarkable scenes on Wall Street....the Dow Jones index is now up! Only by 17 points, or a meagre 0.1%, but it\u2019s a start.... Here\u2019s our City editor, Jill Treanor, on the escalating concerns about the banking sector, which hit shares across Europe again today: Growing anxiety about whether banks can withstand continued low interest rates and fears of a re-run of the 2008 financial crisis continued to stalk markets when shares fell to a three-year low and bank shares remained volatile. As shares in Deutsche Bank plumbed new depths on Tuesday and the bank\u2019s chief executive had to reassure its 100,000 staff that it was \u201crock solid\u201d, concerns mounted about the health of the global banking sector. \u201cMany are asking \u2018crisis\u2019 questions: \u2018Is there risk of a financial crisis re-run\u2019 and \u2018can a large European bank face a liquidity event\u2019?\u201d said analysts at Goldman Sachs. The Goldman analysts reckon the alarm bells are ringing too loudly. They recognise that market confidence is \u201cfast deteriorating\u201d but point to the \u20ac800bn (\u00a3625bn) of capital that European banks have raised since the 2008 crisis as evidence that the fears are overdone \u2013 together with the fact that customers are continuing to make deposits and there are no signs of strain in the crucial money markets. The collapse in confidence in the banking sector since the start of the year has been dramatic. Shares in Deutsche Bank have slumped by almost 40%, UniCredit of Italy is down more than 40% while Credit Suisse is down 37% . The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 banking index is down 27%..... And here\u2019s the full story: Another dose of turbulence on Wall Street is driving shares higher! The Dow is now down just 11 points, having been down more than 100 points earlier. The cloud of worry hovering over Deutsche Bank has sent investors, analysts and (especially) journalists dashing to swot up on a newish financial instrument, called CoCos. These contingent convertible bonds were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis, to give European banks an extra wall of protection. They\u2019re been very popular, because they provide a better interest rate than many other bonds. BUT.... that\u2019s because they could potentially be turned into shares, or even wiped out. Deutsche\u2019s CoCos have been slumping in value recently, on fears that the bank will struggle to get enough cash to meet the repayments (last night, it insisted the April 2016 payment was safe). Want to know more? Great. Bloomberg has published a useful Q&amp;A. Here\u2019s a flavour: So how does it work? CoCos typically allow a bank to stop interest payments when it runs into trouble, like when its capital ratios breach levels considered dangerous (that\u2019s the \u201ccontingent\u201d part). If the bank\u2019s financial health deteriorates further, CoCos can force losses on bondholders. The bonds can lose their value entirely or change into common stock (that\u2019s the \u201cconvertible\u201d part). How do banks determine whether they can pay? This is where it gets really technical. To make optional payments such as dividends, bonuses and coupons on CoCos, banks must calculate their \u201cavailable distributable items,\u201d or ADIs. Deutsche Bank, which has to make the calculation based on its audited, unconsolidated accounts under German GAAP, has thinner coverage than other major banks, prompting the current volatility. Why did regulators create CoCos? During the financial crisis, taxpayers had to inject billions of dollars into failing banks, while investors in those lenders\u2019 bonds were often fully repaid. Officials wanted to create ways to avoid this in the future. Here\u2019s the full piece: How the Bank Debt That Everyone Is Talking About Works: Q&amp;A It\u2019s tough being a bank right now: Chins up, though. It could be worse: Here\u2019s that sudden slide in the Brent crude oil price, back down to $30.60/barrel. That may alarm crude producers, as they gather in London for International Petroleum Week. And the oil slide is getting worse. Brent crude is now down 6% at $30.92 a barrel on reports that US stockpiles will show an increase in the latest weekly figures, adding to fears of lack of demand and a continuing supply glut. According to a Reuters survey, crude stockpiles are expected to have risen by 3.9m barrels last week. Meanwhile the Energy Information Administration said it had cut its forecasts for oil demand in 2016 by 110,000 barrels a day and by 260,000 barrels in 2017. That seems to have pushed Wall Street even lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 136 points or 0.8%. Oil prices continue to fall, with Brent crude now down 3.8% at $31.63 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - down 2.2% at $29.01. Earlier the International Energy Agency said the world will be stockpiling excess oil for most of 2016, and cut its forecast for demand this year, meaning the supply glut will continue for some while yet. Global markets, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index, are close to a bear market, that is, 20% below their recent peak: In yet another volatile day, European markets were firmly in the red once more as investors shied away from risk. With Japanese 10 year bond yields turning negative in another sign of the growing fear of a global recession, poor German industrial figures and a widening trade gap in the UK, there was no shortage of downbeat news. Banks were in the firing line again on worries about their exposure to struggling sectors and the implications of negative interest rates, in particular Deutsche Bank despite its attempts to calm worries about the state of its business. The Stoxx Europe 600 banking index - which includes the likes of Deutsche Bank, Barclays, and HSBC lost another 3.97% and is now down more than 27% on the year. Wall Street is also in a turbulent mood, opening lower, recovering into positive territory after reasonable US jobs data and a rebound in technology stocks, before falling once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently arouind 70 points or 0.4% lower, but the US market performance did help pull European markets away from their worst levels. So in Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 57.17 points or 1% to 5632.19, a new three year low. Earlier it dropped as low as 5596 Germany\u2019s Dax lost 1.1% to 8879.4 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.69% at 3997.54 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.21% to 15913.12 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.39% lower at 7927.6 In Greece, the Athens market is down another 2.89% to 450.83 Risk analyst and author of the bestseller The Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb on Deutsche Bank: More on the latest jobs data from the US, ahead of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen testifying to Congress on Wednesday. Economist Harm Bandholz at UniCredit said: Following Friday\u2019s solid employment report, today\u2019s JOLTS report was another display of strength: Job openings rose to 5.6m, the second highest since the beginning of the series in 2001, while the number of quits \u2013 i.e. voluntary separations by employees \u2013 rose to 3.1m, the highest since late 2006. The latter suggests a growing number of more profitable job opportunities for workers as the labor market is approaching full employment. This notion is consistent with the recent pick-up in average hourly earnings at the turn of the year. These underlying statistics, which usually get less attention that payroll gains or the unemployment rate, help to complete the assessment of the labor market situation. And chair Yellen is known to put particular emphasis on the JOLTS data. Accordingly, she should mention them tomorrow in the context of an improving labor market. Skeptics may argue that these numbers are backward looking, and that spillovers from tighter financial conditions or the energy slump will curb labor market dynamics in the months to come. This is certainly a risk, and one important reason, why the Fed is currently sitting back and wait. But why should this happen now, when it hasn\u2019t over the past several months? After all, oil prices have started to fall in mid-2014, and most of the adjustment occurred in the first half of 2015. Investment in mining structures has plummeted by 51% in 2015, with more than half of the drop occurring in the first half of the year. Similarly, the rig count plunged by more than 70% since the peak in September 2014, with almost 80% of that drop before the middle of last year. Since then, more than half a year has passed without any negative spill-overs to other parts of economy. Quite the contrary: The employment situation has improved further and workers are now feeling it. JP Morgan has worked out what it thinks are the exposure of European and US banks to the struggling oil and gas sector - and it amounts to $250bn: The FTSE 100\u2019s fall to three year lows is an overreaction, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The research group said it had been warning about the weakness of the global economy for some time, and said in particular that the US Federal Reserve\u2019s rate rise in December was premature. But the current market falls were overdone. Scott Corfe, director and head of macroeconomics at Cebr, said: Markets have somewhat belatedly woken up to the underlying state of economic reality. We will be in a world of sluggish growth, loose monetary policy and low commodity prices for some time. As usual with the markets, it is either feast or famine. Our best view of the current circumstances is that, despite all the risks, we should avoid another financial crisis. In particular, Chinese policymakers have sufficient fiscal and monetary ammunition to revitalise the world\u2019s second largest economy. More quantitative easing in the Eurozone, and possibly the US, should also help. So the most likely scenario is modest growth in the world economy this year. When the reality of this is understood and if there is further monetary relaxation, it is quite likely that the markets will turn. They tend to be a useful lagging indicator. Here\u2019s a quick snapshot of how top banks have performed since the start of the year (spoilers: badly), courtesy of David Buik of Panmure Gordon: Some positive news on US jobs. The number of job openings increased to 5.6m in December, up from 5.43m in the previous months and compared to expectations of a dip to 5.41m. The quits rate - which the US Federal Reserve considers a sign of worker confidence in the jobs market - rose to 3.1m. Those figures seemed to calm Wall Street for a moment, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving into positive territory before slipping back again. Here are the moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average: Wall Street is stabilising a little, but the main indices are still down. The New York opening bell is ringing, getting trading underway on Wall Street. And shares are dropping. The Dow Jones has lost 137 points in an early bout of selling, sending the index down 0.8% to 15,893. The S&amp;P 500 index (the broadest measure of US shares) has lost 0.75% And the Nasdaq index (heavy with tech stocks) is down 1.39% The European selloff is gathering speed, as investors brace for Wall Street to open any moment... The FTSE 100 is now down 89 points at 5600, which by my reckoning is the lowest since July 2012 Germany finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has just weighed in, telling Bloomberg TV that he has \u2018no concerns\u2019 about Deutsche Bank. That\u2019s the most senior intervention yet, coming shortly after CEO John Cryan told staff the bank \u201cremains absolutely rock-solid\u201d. Here\u2019s the details: German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he isn\u2019t worried about Deutsche Bank, amid rising investor concern over the bank\u2019s finances. \u201cI have no concerns about Deutsche Bank,\u201d he told Bloomberg Television after a press conference in Paris. Sch\u00e4uble was attending a joint meeting of French and German finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Paris. Make that 5%..... As we flagged up this morning, Deutsche Bank is one of several banks who is now trading significantly below its book value -- what its portfolio of assets, liabilities, capital reserves, etc is actually worth. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have now lost another 3.5%, hitting \u20ac13.30. That\u2019s just below the lowpoint set in early 2009, after Lehman Brothers failed, and is the lowest since at least 1992 (my data doesn\u2019t go back any further). Wall Street is still expected to open in the red, at 9.30am New York time (2.30pm GMT). According to IG, the Dow will shed around 150 points at the open, a drop of 0.9%. They also predict that the VIX \u201cfear\u201d index, which tracks volatility, will jump by over 4%. That shows rising nervousness, although not a full-blown panic. European stocks are now languishing at their lowest level since September 2013, as the market rout continues to ripple across trading floors. The benchmark FTSeurofirst 100 index has lost 1.9% today, driven down by banking shares. The European banking index is down 3.4%, hit by fears over Italy\u2019s financial sector, and by Deutsche Bank (now down 3% since that \u2018rock solid\u2019 memo). The selloff puts more pressure on the European Central Bank to announce new stimulus measures next month, as Reuters explains: The banking index was set for its biggest weekly losing streak since 1998 as investors fret over the threat to banks\u2019 profitability and capital strength from compressed interest rate margins. \u201cThe mood is clearly negative. What is needed is a strong and clear message from the ECB,\u201d said Activtrades chief market analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa. Shares in London are falling at a faster pace now, dragging the FTSE 100 down to its lowest intraday level since late 2012. The blue-chip index has shed 76 points now, as jitters over the global economy rear up again. The FTSE is now down at 5,613 points, a drop of 1.3% today, smashing through the previous three-year low set last month (when London slumped into a Bear Market amid a wave of panic selling). The London market is being dragged down by mining shares, reflecting concerns about economic prospects: The biggest faller is Antofagasta, a major copper producer, followed by Anglo American - whose interests include iron ore, nickel, and coal. Their shares have been under pressure for months, as emerging market problems have hit demand for commodities. Deutsche Bank\u2019s claim that it is \u201crock-solid\u201d doesn\u2019t appear to have stabilised the markets. And the prospect of losses on Wall Street today is adding to the nervous feeling in the City, as traders reach for their metaphorical tin hats. Wall Street is expected to suffer fresh losses when trading begins in under two hours time. The futures market is predicting that the Dow will drop by 121 points, or 0.75%, with similar falls on the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors have no appetitive for risk assets right now, given fears over a global recession. It must be understood that confidence towards the global economy remains strikingly low, while the bitter decline in oil prices has soured risk appetite consequently obstructing any solid recovery in the stock markets. I\u2019m not sure Deutsche Bank should really be speculating about whether the market selloff has gone too far.... Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief executive has issued an open letter to staff, in an attempt to calm fears over the company. John Cryan, who took over last year, told employees that Deutsche is \u201cabsolutely rock solid\u201d. Last week, at one of our scheduled off-sites, the Management Board talked about progress on our strategy, and how recent market volatility and forecasts for slowing economic growth might impact our clients and us. Volatility in the fourth quarter impacted the earnings of most major banks, especially those in Europe, and clients may ask you about how the market-wide volatility is impacting Deutsche Bank. You can tell them that Deutsche Bank remains absolutely rock-solid, given our strong capital and risk position. On Monday, we took advantage of this strength to reassure the market of our capacity and commitment to pay coupons to investors who hold our Additional Tier 1 capital. This type of instrument has been the subject of recent market concern. The market also expressed some concern about the adequacy of our legal provisions but I don\u2019t share that concern. We will almost certainly have to add to our legal provisions this year but this is already accounted for in our financial plan. Cryan also explains how he wants to turn Deutsche into \u201ca trusted and successful bank\u201d. It has been involved in several scandals in recent years, and was fined for doing business with US-sanctioned countries like Iran and Syria. The letter is online here. Cryan is obviously keen to douse concerns that Deutsche is struggling, after it reported a \u20ac6bn loss last October. Shares in Deutsche Bank are falling, though. After a solid start, they\u2019re now down 1%, adding to yesterday\u2019s 9% tumble. Mining companies are leading the selloff in London: Heads-up, UK readers. The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that British interest rates will stay on hold until 2020! The EIU argues that the UK recovery is much more vulnerable than previously thought. US economy will experience a downturn in 2019, they predict, while rising levels of indebtedness in China will pose another challenge. And that means: We no longer expect tightening to begin in the final quarter of this year. We now expect the Bank of England to hold off on tightening for the next four years at least. That\u2019s a pretty dovish forecast. Many economists reckon the first rate hike will come in 2017 or 2018. European markets are falling deeper into the red, as lunchtime approaches. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the 600 largest companies across Europe, has dropped by 0.7% to a new 16-month low. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has lost another 1.7%, the French CAC is down 1% and the German Dax has lost 0.6%, despite the forced-looking air of jollity among the fancy-dressed traders. In London, the Footsie 100 is down 31 points or 0.5%, as traders continue to be depressed by the slump in Japan overnight. Achilles Macris has just issued a response to the FCA\u2019s decision to fine him \u00a3792,000 today for not being open over the London Whale case. Macris claims it\u2019s a \u201cmajor climbdown\u201d by the regulator, because the FCA has belatedly accepted that he never intentionally misled them. He declares: The Final Notice issued to JP Morgan by the FCA in 2013 wrongly and unfairly accused me of deliberately misleading the FSA. That Notice was released to the public without the FCA ever having properly heard my side of the story. Today the FCA has finally accepted that this allegation against me was utterly wrong. Today\u2019s result also vindicates my actions in bringing my third party reference seeking to have this allegation removed from the JP Morgan Notice. The FCA demonstrated a total disregard for my rights as an individual in its haste to issue the JP Morgan Notice and impose a large fine on the firm. Macris is also taking his case to the Supreme Court, and wants the FCA to expunge that original Notice. The FCA has had several opportunities to admit its mistakes, but instead, at every turn, it has until now sought to defend and justify its position, wasting public funds. Yikes. The yield (interest rate) on Greek 10-year bonds has hit its highest level since last August. Some investors are losing faith in Greece\u2019s ability to implement its third bailout and get debt relief. Talks with its creditors over pensions reforms are bogged down, farmers are blockading roads to demonstrate against austerity, and exporters are suffering from the capital controls imposed last summer. Although European markets are rather calmer than yesterday, there\u2019s an awful lot of jitteriness around. Ironically, the Asian Lunar New Year appears to have actually made things worse, rather than just remove the volatile Chinese indices from the mix. Kit Juckes, experienced currency strategist at French Bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, explains: The absence of many Asian market participants just adds to woeful liquidity conditions, while concerns about commodities, Chinese currency policy and global slowdown haven\u2019t gone away at all. Add to that sharp widening in subordinated European bank spreads and we have the makings of a very nervous market. Wondering whether to be fearful or cheerful today? Our video runs though the reasons to panic, or be optimistic The banking sector likes to argue that it has mended its ways since the financial crisis struck. Critics aren\u2019t convinced. So it\u2019s worth noting that Britain\u2019s City watchdog has just slapped a \u00a3792,900 fine on a former senior JP Morgan banker, over one of the biggest scandals of recent years. Achilles Macris, the ex head of CIO International for JPMorgan Chase Bank, has been sanctioned for failing to be \u201copen and co-operative\u201d with regulators over the \u201cLondon Whale trades\u201d which ultimately cost them \u00a313bn. The London Whale was Bruno Iksil \u2013 whose bullish and complicated trades turned sour in 2012. Despite the potential risks, Macris didn\u2019t tell the Financial Conduct Authority the full extent of the problems, they say. This made it harder for the FCA to judge the situation, and also made it harder for more junior staff to be open and cooperative. Mark Steward, director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, says: \u2018A failure to communicate openly with us can affect the well-running of markets and cause unnecessary harm to investors, especially in times of financial stress or crisis. Regulators need open communication with firms so that better decisions can be made sooner. Mr Macris should have explained the position more squarely especially when he knew the Synthetic Credit Portfolio\u2019s losses had worsened.\u2019 What a shame that the review in to Britain\u2019s banking culture has been shelved.... Here\u2019s a reminder of the most astonishing development of the day (so far) -- investors are now paying for the privilege to lend to the Japanese government for the next decade: Yield is the interest rate on a bond. A high yield means a bond is riskier, while safe-haven assets yield less. Short-term German and Japanese bonds have been negative for a while, reflecting the fact that they\u2019re a solid place to put your money (especially as there are negative interest rates in Japan and the eurozone). But for a 10-year bond to be negative? That shows investors are pricing in weak economic growth, and turmoil, for some time. Nice summary of the situation from Bloomberg: if you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our latest news story on the upheaval in the global markets: The huge selloff in Japan overnight has hit sentiment hard in the City today. Investors had been hoping that the Chinese New Year holiday would bring some calm; instead, traders have been staring at a 918-point tumble on the Nikkei. Alastair McCaig of spread-betting firm IG explains: Any hope investors might have had that the absence of China would enable markets to reduce volatility and rebalance some of the overly bearish sentiment has been quashed by Japan. In London, the Footsie is struggling to hold onto any gains, while there are further losses across Europe - on top of Monday\u2019s rout. The Italian market has lost another 1%, as fears over its banking sector mount up (see this earlier post for details) The government debt of some peripheral European countries, including Portugal and Greece, is coming under pressure today. Is the eurozone debt crisis rearing up again?.... McCaig says it\u2019s another worry: The situation in Greece was never resolved, merely delayed until later. Greek 10-year sovereign debt is now yielding over 10% \u2013 a jump of 25% in little over a month, and 50% from its lows in November last year. The gap between what Britain imports and exports has hit a record high, in a worrying signal. During 2015, the UK imported around \u00a310bn more physical stuff than it exported each month. And that means Britain posted a trade in goods deficit of \u00a3125bn last year, up from last year\u2019s all time high of \u00a3123.1bn. Worryingly, UK good exports fell by \u00a38.1bn last year, while imports of goods fell by \u00a36.2bn. That was partly balanced by Britain\u2019s a \u00a390bn surplus in service sector trade (the City does have its uses). But overall, the annual trade deficit widened to \u00a334.7bn in 2015, up \u00a30.3 billion from 2014. Here\u2019s the report. In December alone, the trade gap came in at \u00a32.7bn. And this is bad news for the economic recovery, as net trade is continuing to drag on growth. It knocked one whole percentage point off GDP growth in the third quarter of 2015, for example. The ONS also warns that growth in UK exports to China slowed last year... It says: The slower growth in UK exports to China may reflect the easing in output growth and domestic growth in China, lowering the demand for UK goods and services. There\u2019s no prospect of the global oil glut ending anytime soon. That\u2019s the latest warning from the International Energy Agency. The IEA has just predicted that the world will be stockpiling excess oil for most of 2016, as the price war launched by OPEC has failed to kill the US shale industry. The IEA also cut its forecast for oil demand this year, which will only add to the glut. And as for prices, the IEA says it is \u201cvery hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly\u201d, if crude oil stockpiles continue to grow. Oil is currently changing hands at $33 per barrel -- good news for consumers, and countries who import the stuff. But it\u2019s already having a serious impact on petro-producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, energy companies, and the banks who have lent to them.... Has the stock market selloff gone too far? Banking analyst Sandy Chen argues that there are bargains out there. He points out that some banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC, are now trading significantly below their \u2018book value\u2019 (their market capitalisation is below the actual value of their assets). Chen says: Looking at valuations, it appears that another Global Financial Crisis is already priced-in. These low valuations were only seen in the depths of the 2008/9 financial crisis, after Lehman Brothers failed. So the City is pricing in some \u201chorrendous losses\u201d. Clearly the situation in China isn\u2019t pretty, as Beijing tries to avoid a hard economic landing. But Chan argues the Chinese banks and regional authorities will absorb the brunt of the losses. So, this could be a good moment for \u2018value investors\u2019 to dip back into the market. Or, the City might be right, and the financial sector could be heading into another big crisis. Caveat emptor.... Banks are being hit by a \u201cdangerous cocktail\u201d of risks, warns Mike van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets. Those risks include: slowing economic growth (the IMF downgraded its forecasts last month) more widespread use of negative interest rates (now in Japan and the eurozone) financial market turbulence (major stock markets have lost between 8% and 15% since January 1st) a protracted commodity market depression (oil hit a 13-year low last month) rising bad loans (from commodity exposure) which could affect their ability to repay debt. And that\u2019s why European bank shares have lost a quarter of their value this year. Curious scenes in Frankfurt today, where traders have dressed up in carnival costumes for Shrove Tuesday.... European banks are coming under the cosh this morning, as investors anticipate further problems ahead. The Stoxx 600 Banks index, which tracks financial stocks across Europe, has fallen by 1.7% already today. That follows a 5.6% fall yesterday. The sector has now lost 25% of its value since the start of 2016, as fears of a global downturn have savaged market valuations. Italian banking stocks are leading the fallers, reflecting concerns that they are bogged down with bad loans. Prime Minister Renzi\u2019s government is pushing Italian banks to clean up their balance sheets, but an economic downturn could make the problem even worse. Mining stocks are taking a hammering this morning, dragging the Footsie into the red again: That positive London open didn\u2019t last long. The FTSE is now down 15 points..... Shares in Deutsche Bank have risen by 2%, as investors gingerly return to the Frankfurt trading floor. Deutsche plunged by 9% yesterday, prompting the bank to insist last night that it can meet an April repayment on its riskiest bonds. These are the CoCos, or contingent convertible bonds, which pay an attractive interest rate - but will be converted to shares if the bank hits trouble. European stock markets are open....and staggering back from yesterday\u2019s turmoil. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 35 points, or 0.6%. Insurance firm Legal &amp; General is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by retailers Kingfisher (which runs the B&amp;Q DIY chain) and Next, both up 2%. But mining shares are leading the fallers, with copper producer Antofagasta down 3.3%, Anglo American down 2.4% and Rio Tinto off 1.9%. They\u2019re all vulnerable to a global downturn, which will push commodity prices down even further.... Traders on the Philippine Stock Exchange had an interesting day -- a crowd of lion dancers and dragons popped in, to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Despite this excitement, though, the main Philippine stock index fell by 1.9%. We have bad news from Germany -- industrial production at the eurozone\u2019s powerhouse economy tumbled by 1.2% in December. That\u2019s much worse than expected; economists had pencilled in a 0.4% rise in factory output. It suggest the slowdown in emerging markets is now hitting Europe, threatening its fragile recovery since the eurozone crisis. The fall was driven by a 2.6% slump in the manufacturing of investment goods, while energy production fell by 3% percent and consumer goods output fell 1.4%. ING economist Carsten Brzeski isn\u2019t prone to exaggeration, but even he is alarmed: He writes: While the industry had been able to stomach the cooling of the Chinese economy, the slowdown of emerging markets, the euro crisis and geopolitical risks, it now seems as if extremely low oil prices and the slowdown of the US economy are simply two risks too much for the industry. Germany already has plenty to worry about, given the uncertainty over Deutsche Bank. Falling factory output could hit public confidence, warns that Economist Intelligence Unit: In another alarming development, the yield (interest rate) on Japanese 10-year government bonds has turned negative for the first time. That means investors are prepared to pay Tokyo for the privilege of lending to it for the next decade. That shows how much anxiety has built up in the markets right now, and also shows the impact of Japan\u2019s new negative interest rates (which penalise banks for leaving money in the Bank of Japan\u2019s vaults) Japanese manufacturers were also hit hard today, as the yen strengthened against the US dollar (hurting exporters). Car makers were singled out - with Honda falling by 6.4%, Nissan losing 6.8% and Toyota dropped 5.9%. Kei Okamura, assistant investment manager at Aberdeen Investment Management, says investors are fretting about weak Japanese economy, which forced the Bank of Japan to impose negative interest rates last week. \u201cI think this sort of succession of events is feeding through to pessimism in the market,\u201d Okamura said (via Reuters) Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo, says there was a \u201cpanic situation\u201d in Asian markets today. Here\u2019s Justin McCurry\u2019s report of the turmoil which wiped almost 1,000 points at one stage. Fears of a global recession have sparked a wild selloff in Japan today. After plunging through the day, the benchmark Nikkei index has closed down 5.5% in a wave of panicky selling. That wiped 918 points off the Nikkei, leaving it at 16,085. That\u2019s the biggest one-day plunge in three years, as full-blown angst grips the markets. Jo Masters, a senior economist at ANZ, says: \u201cSentiment towards risk assets remained extremely bearish and price action reflected a market that may be capitulating.\u201d Banks led the rout, hit by the concerns over the world financial sector. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group sank 8.7% and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group plunged by 9.0%. Other markets were badly hit too, with Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 shedding 2.8%. It was a \u201cday of trauma\u201d for bullish investors, says Chris Weston at IG. He fears that the market rout is going to continue, with banks pulled deeper into the line of fire: There is huge demand for portfolio protection in all asset classes and it just doesn\u2019t feel like we are going to see a major turn anytime soon. One can then do a sense check as to what will effectively turn this juggernaut of pain around and this is not a question that is readily answered. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. No prizes for guessing what we\u2019ll be covering today. After Monday\u2019s stock market rout, which wiped \u00a340bn of leading shares in London, fears over the state of the global economy and the financial sector are gripping the markets again today. It\u2019s been a wild day in Asia, as investors in Japan caught up with the slump in Europe and on Wall Street yesterday. And European shares are expected to keep falling when trading begins: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sets the scene: If investors were hoping for a quiet week away from concerns about China with Chinese markets closed for Chinese New Year, they got a very rude awakening yesterday as stock markets sold off hard, and there was no respite in Asia markets either despite a late rebound off the lows in the US and as such we could well see European markets open lower today. The catalyst appeared to come from the European banking sector as screens flashed red across the board in scenes of total carnage, with equity markets selling off hard across the board over concerns about the future profitability of the whole sector, in an era where interest rates look set to go further into negative territory. Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank is in the spotlight - last night, it issued a statement reassuring investors that it can meet bond payments in April. The big fear is that this turbulence starts feeding through to businesses and the public dragging the global economy downwards. And concern is already building that the UK government is facing a nasty black hole in its fiscal plans, as our front page shows: If you missed the IFS story yesterday, it\u2019s here. What\u2019s coming up today? Well, there are two pieces of economic data that could shift the dial: 7am GMT: New German industrial production data 9.30am: UK trade figures for December. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

They\u2019re been very popular, because they provide a better interest rate than many other bonds. BUT.... that\u2019s because they could potentially be turned into shares, or even wiped out.</p> <p>Deutsche\u2019s CoCos have been slumping in value recently, on fears that the bank will struggle to get enough cash to meet the repayments (last night, it insisted the April 2016 payment was safe).</p> <p>Want to know more? Great.<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-09/how-the-bank-debt-that-everyone-is-talking-about-works-q-a\"> Bloomberg has published a useful Q&amp;A</a>.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a flavour:</p> <h2>So how does it work?</h2> <p>CoCos typically allow a bank to stop interest payments when it runs into trouble, like when its capital ratios breach levels considered dangerous (that\u2019s the \u201ccontingent\u201d part). If the bank\u2019s financial health deteriorates further, CoCos can force losses on bondholders. The bonds can lose their value entirely or change into common stock (that\u2019s the \u201cconvertible\u201d part).</p> <h2>How do banks determine whether they can pay?</h2> <p>This is where it gets really technical. To make optional payments such as dividends, bonuses and coupons on CoCos, banks must calculate their \u201cavailable distributable items,\u201d or ADIs. Deutsche Bank, which has to make the calculation based on its audited, unconsolidated accounts under German GAAP, has thinner coverage than other major banks, prompting the current volatility. </p> <h2>Why did regulators create CoCos?</h2> <p>During the financial crisis, taxpayers had to inject billions of dollars into failing banks, while investors in those lenders\u2019 bonds were often fully repaid. Officials wanted to create ways to avoid this in the future.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the full piece:<br></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-09/how-the-bank-debt-that-everyone-is-talking-about-works-q-a\">How the Bank Debt That Everyone Is Talking About Works: Q&amp;A </a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56ba3131e4b0a789c640efe1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-09T18:36:30.405Z\">6.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s tough being a bank right now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyIanKingLive/status/697126142206152705\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As bank shares slump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomstevenson63\">@tomstevenson63</a>, investment director <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fidelity_UK\">@Fidelity_UK</a> tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanKingSky\">@IanKingSky</a> low rates are squeezing lenders&#39; margins</p>&mdash; Ian King Live Team (@SkyIanKingLive) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyIanKingLive/status/697126142206152705\">February 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBiz/status/697126563855343616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickjenkins_\">@patrickjenkins_</a> asst editor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FT\">@FT</a> says European banks are in the &quot;eye of the storm&quot; with Deutsche especially in focus</p>&mdash; Sky News Business (@SkyNewsBiz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBiz/status/697126563855343616\">February 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Chins up, though.

Economist Harm Bandholz at UniCredit said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Following Friday\u2019s solid employment report, today\u2019s JOLTS report was another display of strength: Job openings rose to 5.6m, the second highest since the beginning of the series in 2001, while the number of quits \u2013 i.e. voluntary separations by employees \u2013 rose to 3.1m, the highest since late 2006. The latter suggests a growing number of more profitable job opportunities for workers as the labor market is approaching full employment. This notion is consistent with the recent pick-up in average hourly earnings at the turn of the year.</p> <p>These underlying statistics, which usually get less attention that payroll gains or the unemployment rate, help to complete the assessment of the labor market situation. And chair Yellen is known to put particular emphasis on the JOLTS data. Accordingly, she should mention them tomorrow in the context of an improving labor market. </p> <p>Skeptics may argue that these numbers are backward looking, and that spillovers from tighter financial conditions or the energy slump will curb labor market dynamics in the months to come. This is certainly a risk, and one important reason, why the Fed is currently sitting back and wait. But why should this happen now, when it hasn\u2019t over the past several months? After all, oil prices have started to fall in mid-2014, and most of the adjustment occurred in the first half of 2015. Investment in mining structures has plummeted by 51% in 2015, with more than half of the drop occurring in the first half of the year. Similarly, the rig count plunged by more than 70% since the peak in September 2014, with almost 80% of that drop before the middle of last year. Since then, more than half a year has passed without any negative spill-overs to other parts of economy. Quite the contrary: The employment situation has improved further and workers are now feeling it. </p> </blockquote> <p><a><br></a><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56ba0d9de4b01b57bb994011\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-09T16:03:32.786Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>JP Morgan has worked out what it thinks are the exposure of European and US banks to the struggling oil and gas sector - and it amounts to $250bn:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/697086898792226816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bank exposure to oil &amp; gas sector $250B ($170B European, $80B US).

But the current market falls were overdone. Scott Corfe, director and head of macroeconomics at Cebr, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have somewhat belatedly woken up to the underlying state of economic reality. We will be in a world of sluggish growth, loose monetary policy and low commodity prices for some time.</p> <p>As usual with the markets, it is either feast or famine. Our best view of the current circumstances is that, despite all the risks, we should avoid another financial crisis.

      "bodyText": "One benefit of the current panic over banks\u2019 capital is that bankers \u2013 finally \u2013 may stop whining about the supposedly onerous requirements imposed on them by wicked regulators with an over-developed sense of safety. Cast your mind back a few years and the Bank of England was being accused of operating as a \u201ccapital Taliban\u201d. It was an absurd phrase for the equally ridiculous idea that Threadneedle Street was being too tough in insisting that capital buffers should be reinforced quickly. That row climaxed in a showdown in 2013 with Barclays, which didn\u2019t like being prodded to go to shareholders to plug a capital shortfall. The regulators insisted, thankfully, and the bank raised \u00a35.8bn via a rights issue. A good thing too: Barclays shares in those days were 270p, rather than the current 156p, which made the capital-raising smoother than it would be today. No regulator, of course, can guarantee in advance that a required level of capital will be sufficient to survive all storms, which is one reason why Deutsche Bank\u2019s contingent convertible bonds \u2013 or \u201ccocos\u201d \u2013 are causing so much anxiety. On that score, though, the fault surely lies with investors who swallowed the bankers\u2019 line that capital cushions were so plump that nothing could go wrong. Come on, the clue was on the label. Cocos are convertible bonds and convertible instruments sometimes convert, in this case into equity. Deutsche, for all we know, may indeed be \u201cabsolutely rock-solid\u201d, as its co-chief executive maintains, and able to keep paying the coupons, or interest payments, on its cocos. But, if it is not, those bondholders can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned: the cocos offered a juicy yield because they came with risks. There is a separate debate about whether cocos \u2013 which are designed to absorb losses and add to capital when required \u2013 actually end up creating panic when there is even a whiff of danger of conversion. That is how the plot is running at the moment. But, if we are heading towards a fresh banking crisis (still unlikely, but you never know with businesses as opaque as banks), there are far bigger worries. In the UK, one central reform is ring-fencing, the separation of the retailing banking units from investment banking activities. The theory is sound: in a crisis, it should be easier to remove the critical pieces of a failing bank, and thus avoid a repeat of the fiasco at Royal Bank of Scotland, which had to be nationalised in its gruesome entirety in 2008. But here\u2019s the problem: banks have been given until 2019 to erect their ringfences. That is why Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, had to concede last year that taxpayers could still be on the hook. \u201cWe have many more options in terms of what would happen were an institution to fail, but I can\u2019t sit here today and tell you that the largest banks are resolvable today,\u201d he said. Nobody took much notice at the time, but they should now. Why on earth were too-big-to-fail banks given so long to get their houses in order? The standard answer \u2013 restructuring is complex \u2013 was always feeble. It\u2019s now fair to expect Carney, and the politicians, to answer the question fully: if the worst were to happen, what would you actually do to spare taxpayers? It\u2019s easy, Stelios: dividends are better than shares Some people are never happy. Shares in easyJet have quadrupled in the past half-decade, but founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who owns 34% with members of his family, prefers to see a glass half empty. Over the past two years, he grumbles, the shares have \u201cstagnated\u201d, falling 12% while Ryanair\u2019s have improved 87%. His arithmetic is correct but did he really think easyJet could sustain the steep ascent seen in 2012 and 2013? On a five-year view, easyJet is still ahead. Haji-Ioannou\u2019s real beef is that he would like easyJet to pay out 50% of its post-tax earnings as dividends, rather than the current 40%. It\u2019s a point of view, but 40% seems about right given the inevitable volatility in the airline business and easyJet\u2019s need to invest. As for his claim that excess cash over his 50% ratio should be returned by share buyback because it is \u201ca better way to maximise shareholder value\u201d, he should get out more. Yes, it\u2019s worked OK for Ryanair, but the world is awash with companies who thought their shares were cheap just before they got considerably cheaper \u2013 Glencore and Rolls-Royce, for example. Nine times out of 10, dividends are better. Thiam doesn\u2019t need any more credit \u2013 he\u2019s got Credit Suisse The applause for Tidjane Thiam, new-ish chief executive of Credit Suisse, for requesting a cut in his bonus is bizarre. Nobody has explained why the former Prudential boss will get a bonus in the first place. The Swiss bank has just plunged to a huge annual loss and its share price has halved in six months. This shouldn\u2019t be a moment for dishing out prizes, even ones where the recipient is volunteering to hand back between a quarter and a half. Maybe Thiam is being given a bonus for promising to tackle his predecessor\u2019s failure to address Credit Suisse\u2019s inflated bonus culture. But, if that\u2019s the case, you can understand why the bank is in such a pickle. Rewards for success should flow after the job has been completed, not when there is merely a plant. \u201cMr Thiam has shown real leadership,\u201d proclaimed Royal London Asset Management. Really? You don\u2019t even know yet how much, in hard francs, he has asked to surrender.",

      "bodyText": "Growing anxiety about whether banks can withstand continued low interest rates and fears of a re-run of the 2008 financial crisis continued to stalk markets when shares fell to a three-year low and bank shares remained volatile. As shares in Deutsche Bank plumbed new depths on Tuesday and the bank\u2019s chief executive had to reassure its 100,000 staff that it was \u201crock solid\u201d, concerns mounted about the health of the global banking sector. \u201cMany are asking \u2018crisis\u2019 questions: \u2018Is there risk of a financial crisis re-run\u2019 and \u2018can a large European bank face a liquidity event\u2019?\u201d said analysts at Goldman Sachs. The Goldman analysts reckon the alarm bells are ringing too loudly. They recognise that market confidence is \u201cfast deteriorating\u201d but point to the \u20ac800bn (\u00a3625bn) of capital that European banks have raised since the 2008 crisis as evidence that the fears are overdone \u2013 together with the fact that customers are continuing to make deposits and there are no signs of strain in the crucial money markets. The collapse in confidence in the banking sector since the start of the year has been dramatic. Shares in Deutsche Bank have slumped by almost 40%, UniCredit of Italy is down more than 40% while Credit Suisse is down 37% . The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 banking index is down 27%. In the UK, Standard Chartered and Barclays bothfell more than 25% while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in the US were also caught up in the rout, down 17% and 25% respectively. Neil Dwane, a global strategist at Allianz Global Investors who is shunning bank shares, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t liked the banking sector since the financial crisis in Europe \u2026 but this seems to be a global phenomenon, even the apparently \u2018fixed\u2019 American [banks] have been performing poorly.\u201d When the US banks reported their results last month, they barely met market expectations. Major European banks such as Deutsche and Credit Suisse have recorded their first losses since the 2008 crisis. The UK\u2019s banks publish their 2015 results in coming weeks \u2013 they will not be pretty either. The low interest rate environment \u2013 and the realisation that rates will stay low for longer, or even fall into negative territory - is becoming to focus investors. \u201cIt is beginning to dawn on investors that negative interest rates hurt the sector,\u201d said Dwane. \u201cAn element of existential concern is beginning to emerge.\u201d The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are both signalling that they could embark on looser monetary policy, putting further pressure on bank profits The last financial crisis was exacerbated by little-understood investment vehicles such as CDOs (collaterialised debt obligations), synthetic CDOs and monoline insurers. But this time the issues are more straightforward: they centre on concerns about economic growth and the impact of low oil prices. It is proving harder for banks to generate profits and is calling into question the business models of some banks \u2013 Deutsche and Barclays among them. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec said: \u201cThe thing which has genuinely deteriorated for banks is revenue, weak market-related revenue, net interest margin pressure and weak fee income.\u201d Low interest rates make it harder for banks to make profits on their lending. Policymakers point to a series of changes since the 2008 crisis would should make the system safer and are designed to rule out the need for further taxpayer bailouts of banks. Last month, Andrew Bailey, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, outlined some of the key changes: \u201cWe have increased the required equity capital held by banks ... We have introduced liquidity regulation designed to enable banks to withstand the loss of more footloose, short-term wholesale funding, which has gone alongside a sharp shrinkage by banks in their use of that funding.\u201d In the UK, banks are also being required to ringfence their high street arms from riskier investment banking operations \u2013 although they have until 2019 to do so. Bailey pointed to the need for banks to have plans to deal with the fallout if they should ever face collapse. This is known as \u201ca living will\u201d. There are plans in place aimed at forcing each bank\u2019s bondholders to absorb bank losses, rather than taxpayers. It is this new type of bond \u2013 known as contingent capital or cocos \u2013 that are the focus of speculation swirling around Deutsche Bank. The German institution insists there is no cause for alarm and it can keep making the required payments on its coco bonds. But for all the regulatory changes that policymakers can list, there are concerns that reforms have not gone far enough. Anat Admati of Stanford University wrote in this month\u2019s National Institute Economic Review that the reforms had been \u201cmessy and unfocused\u201d. \u201cInstead of simple and cost-effective regulations to counter distorted incentives that harm the economy, regulators have devised extremely complex regulations that may not bring enough benefit to justify the costs but will allow the pretence of action,\u201d she said. Tony Greenham, director of economy at the RSA, doubts that governments have the cash to bail out banks a second time. \u201cIf there is another systemic crisis it should force some more radical ideas \u2013 really break them up, introduce capital controls,\u201d he said. With the ugly mood in the markets, there are fears it could get worse. Banks might soon start to look at the risks they face from each other and start to question whether they should be holding positions overnight. That could precipitate a crisis. Others point out, though, that the markets have already priced in \u201canother global financial crisis\u201d. Sandy Chen, a widely respected analyst at Cenkos Securities, said banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered had fallen to their the lowest stock market valuations, as compared with the value of their assets, that he could remember in his 20 years working in the City. That, he said, indicated that the market was already prepared for them to take huge losses. If he is right \u2013 and the markets have got the fear of a new banking crisis out of proportion \u2013 it could be time to buy those bombed-out bank shares. Said Chen: \u201cThese are the times, for a value-based investor to begin picking up bargains.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "German\u2019s finance minister and the chief executive of Deutsche Bank have both attempted to allay concerns about the health of Germany\u2019s biggest lender as its shares kept falling on another day of financial market turmoil that left London\u2019s stock market at its lowest level for more than three years. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said on Tuesday he had \u201cno concerns\u201d about Deutsche Bank, speaking shortly after John Cryan, who was appointed to run Germany\u2019s biggest bank seven months ago, sent an email to his 100,000 staff to assure them the bank was \u201cabsolutely rock solid\u201d. But their efforts failed to stem the slide in Deutsche\u2019s shares, which fell another 5% on Tuesday, on top of Monday\u2019s 9.5% fall. The shares have now lost more than 40% this year in turbulent markets hit by fears about the growth prospects for the global economy and the implications of the low price of oil and prolonged low interest rates. In London, a 1% fall in the FTSE 100 index pushed it to 5632 at the close, its lowest close since November 2012, although that was higher than the low point of the day \u2013 5596. The mood for the trading day had been set by an overnight plunge in Japan, where the Nikkei index suffered its biggest one-day fall in three years. A loss of 918 points left it 5.5% down at 16,085. Bank shares across Europe were hit hard. Trading of UniCredit of Italy was suspended after falling 6%. Shares in Credit Suisse, UBS and Barclays were all 4% lower. On Wall Street, data showing the jobs market was improving helped bolster sentiment initially before wider concerns took hold, sending the Dow Jones index down 140 points. Oil prices slid as fears of a greater glut of supply in the US coincided with the International Energy Agency warning of a lack of demand. Cryan\u2019s personal interventioncame after an emergency announcement late on Monday that was intended to calm investor concerns that it might not be able to make payments on a special kind of debt that converts into shares during times of crisis. Concerns about Deutsche have swirled since January, when the bank reported its first full-year loss since 2008. It came during a restructuring and the possibility of further hefty fines from regulators. In his email, Cryan, who is attempting to overhaul Deutsche, said: \u201cThe management board talked about progress on our strategy, and how recent market volatility and forecasts for slowing economic growth might impact our clients and us. Volatility in the fourth quarter impacted the earnings of most major banks, especially those in Europe, and clients may ask you about how the market-wide volatility is impacting Deutsche Bank. \u201cYou can tell them that Deutsche Bank remains absolutely rock solid, given our strong capital and risk position. On Monday, we took advantage of this strength to reassure the market of our capacity and commitment to pay coupons to investors who hold our Additional Tier 1 capital. This type of instrument has been the subject of recent market concern.\u201d The chief executive, who is British and has spent much of his career at the Swiss bank UBS, said the bank did not share the market\u2019s concern about whether it had set aside funds to cover fines and other legal matters. \u201cWe will almost certainly have to add to our legal provisions this year but this is already accounted for in our financial plan.\u201d The bank incurred \u20ac5.2bn (\u00a34bn) of litigation charges in 2015.",

      "bodyText": "British Airways is to launch services from Stansted this summer, the first time the flag carrier has operated from the airport. The airline will launch flights at weekends from 28 May to four holiday destinations: Faro, Malaga, Palma and Ibiza. The flights will be operated by BA\u2019s CityFlyer arm, using planes usually based at London City airport. The 98-seat jets usually sit idle at weekends, but the unprecedented move also comes a week after BA warned it could pull its fleet out of London City [paywall] if landing charges were raised. Luke Hayhoe, BA CityFlyer general manager, commercial and customer, said it was \u201ca fantastic opportunity for us to expand our London network and to give our customers even more choice of where to fly\u201d. BA will operate a slightly more upmarket service than Ryanair and other budget competitors at Stansted, with fares starting from \u00a398 return. Stansted\u2019s managing director, Andrew Harrison, said he was delighted to welcome BA, adding: \u201cSince acquiring Stansted, [Manchester Airports Group\u2019s] ambition has been to attract more passengers and a wider choice of airline partners so these new services to Faro, Malaga, Palma and Ibiza are another positive step and very strong additions to our extensive route network that now covers over 170 destinations across Europe and North America.\u201d The news is a fillip for an airport that has ambitions to expand and is pushing to have its rail connections to London developed. On Tuesday, the Network Rail chairman, Peter Hendy, said that expanding the line to Stansted to four tracks was likely to be a priority for many in the government when it drafts the next programme of rail upgrades from 2019. However, BA\u2019s move could also be a shot across London City Airport\u2019s bows. The London Docklands airport\u2019s owners, Global Investment Partners, put it up for sale last year, hoping to net \u00a32bn. BA, the largest airline at London City, believes such a price could only be recouped by an investor raising charges. Last week, BA\u2019s owner, International Airlines Group, warned: \u201cAny potential new owner for London City should be left in no doubt that British Airways can move flights elsewhere if it ramps up airport charges to fund its investment. BA\u2019s customers will not swallow increased fares to fund unrealistic returns for a monopoly airport supplier.\u201d IAG\u2019s boss, Willie Walsh, has also threatened to move operations away from Heathrow should charges be raised to cover the costs of building a third runway, as the Airports Commission recommended.",

In a settlement filed with courts on Monday, music publisher Warner/Chappell agreed to pay $14m to end the lawsuit challenging its right to Happy Birthday To You \u2013 possibly the world\u2019s most famous song. The tune has a long contentious history stretching back to the late 19th century. Warner/Chappell bought the rights for $22m in 1988 and has since made an estimated $2m a year licensing the song for movies and TV. But back in September, US district judge George H King ruled that Warner/Chappell did not own the lyrics to the song, just some of its musical arrangements. Next month, King will get to approve the settlement filed on Monday, making the song available to the public. One of the plaintiffs in the case is Jennifer Nelson. Nelson was making a documentary about the song\u2019s history when she was told she would have to pay $1,500 to use it in her film. \u201cWe revealed a dark side to the happy tune. It\u2019s a song that everyone\u2019s familiar with and grew up with, but nobody knew that this song was copyrighted and you had to pay a license for that,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cThe fact that it was illegally and wrongfully in the clutches of Warner/Chappell really outraged people and now we\u2019ve been able to rectify that situation. So it\u2019s really gratifying.\u201d The memorandum of support filed by the plaintiffs describes the settlement as \u201chistoric\u201d. \u201cBecause defendants have charged for use of the song, untold thousands of people chose not to use the song in their own performances and artistic works or to perform the song in public,\u201d according to the memorandum. \u201cAfter the settlement is approved, that restraint will be removed and the song will be performed and used far more often than it has been in the past.\u201d Even though Warner/Chappell agreed to settle, the company has issued a statement noting that it \u201crespectfully disagreed with the court\u2019s decision\u201d. The settlement is not final until it is approved by King. A hearing on the preliminary approval of the settlement is scheduled for 14 March. \u201cHappy Birthday is finally free after 80 years. Finally, the charade is over. It\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Randall Newman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said back in September when King ruled that Warner/Chappell did not have right to the song. The legal team representing the plaintiffs are seeking a $4.62m fee for their work on the case. The rest of the $14m settlement will be used to compensate everyone who has paid a fee for the use of the song in the past.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Energy giant E.ON and charity Age UK are to suspend a controversial branded tariff for pensioners to new and renewing customers. The move comes days after Ofgem agreed to launch an urgent investigation into allegations that the UK\u2019s largest pensioners\u2019 charity was allegedly accepting \u00a36m a year from the energy supplier to promote the more expensive tariff to older people. The two bodies said on Tuesday the move was due to \u201ccontinued speculation\u201d about the partnership. The tariff will be suspended from Wednesday. The Sun claimed last week that Age UK recommended a special rate from E.ON costing pensioners \u00a31,049 a year \u2013 \u00a3245 more than its cheapest rate. It said the charity received about \u00a341 from E.ON for every person it signed up to the deal, totalling \u00a36m a year. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, asked the watchdog Ofgem to launch an urgent inquiry. The Sun said it found details of E.ON payments to the charity within Age UK\u2019s annual accounts. In a joint statement, German-owned E.ON and Age UK said: \u201cE.ON and Age UK Enterprises have announced that they are temporarily to stop offering an Age UK Enterprises branded tariff to new and renewing E.ON customers from Wednesday 10 February 2016. This decision has been reached on a mutual basis and both organisations retain confidence in the tariff offered to customers. However, due to continued speculation regarding the partnership, both organisations feel it is right to pause and reflect on the best way for both parties to achieve their shared goal of helping customers.\u201d The statement said E.ON customers on other Age UK Enterprises tariffs were unaffected by this move and would be able to continue until their contract expires or move without penalty between tariffs at any point. The Age UK Enterprises tariff has no exit fees, meaning customers can change supplier without incurring any charge. Ian Foy, managing director of Age UK Trading, added: \u201cWe always aim to give our customers outstanding value for money. This decision, prompted by the planned tariff changes, will give us the opportunity to review the current situation.\u201d E.ON confirmed there was a \u201ccommercial relationship\u201d between it and the charity but insisted that its tariffs were competitively priced, while Age UK has rejected any allegations of wrongdoing. There areabout 152,000 customers on the tariff \u2013 equivalent to a \u00a337m overspend, according to the Sun. Will Hodson, co-founder of consumer collective Big Deal, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great news that E.ON have bowed to pressure and scrapped this controversial tariff. It\u2019s just depressing that it took a front-page media story for them to act. Too many people over too many years have paid too much because of E.ON.\u201d",

The tariff will be suspended from Wednesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/eon-urged-refund-pensioners-overcharged-age-uk-tariff\">E.ON and Age UK urged to refund pensioners over fuel deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Sun claimed last week that <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/6907524/Sun-investigation-reveals-Age-UK-recommends-dearer-power-to-pensioners.html\">Age UK recommended a special rate from E.ON</a> costing pensioners \u00a31,049 a year \u2013 \u00a3245 more than its cheapest rate. It said the charity received about \u00a341 from E.ON for every person it signed up to the deal, totalling \u00a36m a year. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, asked the watchdog Ofgem to launch an urgent inquiry.</p> <p>The Sun said it found details of E.ON payments to the charity within Age UK\u2019s annual accounts. </p> <p>In a joint statement, German-owned E.ON and Age UK said: \u201cE.ON and Age UK Enterprises have announced that they are temporarily to stop offering an Age UK Enterprises branded tariff to new and renewing E.ON customers from Wednesday 10 February 2016. This decision has been reached on a mutual basis and both organisations retain confidence in the tariff offered to customers. However, due to continued speculation regarding the partnership, both organisations feel it is right to pause and reflect on the best way for both parties to achieve their shared goal of helping customers.\u201d<br></p> <p>The statement said E.ON customers on other Age UK Enterprises tariffs were unaffected by this move and would be able to continue until their contract expires or move without penalty between tariffs at any point. The Age UK Enterprises tariff has no exit fees, meaning customers can change supplier without incurring any charge.</p> <p>Ian Foy, managing director of Age UK Trading, added: \u201cWe always aim to give our customers outstanding value for money. This decision, prompted by the planned tariff changes, will give us the opportunity to review the current situation.\u201d</p> <p>E.ON confirmed there was a \u201ccommercial relationship\u201d between it and the charity but insisted that its tariffs were competitively priced, while Age UK has rejected any allegations of wrongdoing. <br></p> <p>There areabout 152,000 customers on the tariff \u2013 equivalent to a \u00a337m overspend, according to the Sun. <br></p> <p>Will Hodson, co-founder of consumer collective Big Deal, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great news that E.ON have bowed to pressure and scrapped this controversial tariff. It\u2019s just depressing that it took a front-page media story for them to act. Too many people over too many years have paid too much because of E.ON.\u201d</p>",

The interest rate on the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) touched minus 0.01% in trading on Tuesday. Germany sold government debt in the summer of 2012 at a negative yield, but this was on two-year bonds. The situation in Japan is the first time investors have been prepared to pay for the privilege of lending to a G7 government for a decade. The landmark event is only the most extreme in a bond market which has featured a clutch of countries that have seen the high demand to lend them money (in the expectation of a safe return) pushing up bond prices \u2013 and so driving down the effective interest rate paid on the debt. Germany, France and the Netherlands are among the countries to see their bonds soar in value, though Switzerland (not in the G7) is the only other country to see demand outstrip supply to such an extent that the yield has dropped below zero. Bonds worth about $7tn (\u00a34.8tn) now have a negative yield rate. The rush to safe havens has been driven by panic over the fate of the global economy, with many investors fearing that a severe recession is looming. Falling oil prices and the slowing Chinese and US economies have combined with concerns over the financial security of Europe\u2019s major banks. Amid the market turmoil, Japan is considered one of the safest havens for cash alongside the US and eurozone, which boast the largest debt markets in the world. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has tightened the supply of bonds traded on the debt markets under its massive debt-buying scheme, which has meant buying up around 34% of all JGBs, according to Morgan Stanley. By the end of this year, the investment bank estimates 43% of all JGBs will be owned by the BoJ. The aim of buying the government\u2019s own debt was to increase the price and drive investors to seek gains elsewhere. But turmoil in stock and commodity markets has prompted investors to turn their backs on risky investments. The Nikkei average was down more than 5% on Tuesday. The BoJ has also pushed interest rates to -0.1% to discourage domestic savers and foreign banks from leaving cash on deposit. This move is designed to push down the exchange rate to increase exports and increase inflationary pressures from higher priced imports. But Katsutoshi Inadome, a senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, said the BoJ\u2019s tactics may trigger a bigger crash. \u201cIt appears that hopes for even more BoJ easing are pushing yields down. The market now reasons that the BoJ can drop rates further into the negative if it needs to ease more. But this is worrying, as sharp drops in yields have been followed by a strong backlash in the past,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade deficit worsened in the final quarter of 2015 amid global market turmoil and a slowdown in emerging market growth that has hit exports. The shortfall between exports and imports widened from \u00a38.6bn in the third quarter to \u00a310.4bn, fuelling concerns that UK\u2019s deteriorating trading position will be a drag on GDP growth this year. Figures from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday showed that record aircraft sales and a rise in cars sold abroad were offset by a drop in chemicals exports and the long-term decline in North Sea oil, which has hit the UK\u2019s trade balance since production began to decline at the beginning of the century. The situation improved slightly in December, after a further slide in the export of goods was accompanied by a bigger fall in imports and a greater reliance on exports by the services sector. The overall trade deficit narrowed from a revised \u00a34bn in November to \u00a32.7bn in December, smaller than the consensus expectation of \u00a33bn. Nevertheless, the UK\u2019s goods trade gap with the rest of the world widened by \u00a31.9bn to a record high of \u00a3125bn in 2015. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cUK exports have clearly struggled in recent months, as they have been hampered by sterling\u2019s overall strength in 2015, particularly against the euro, and moderate global demand. \u201cThis was evident in total exports of goods and services falling 0.8% month on month in December and by 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter. Exports of traded goods excluding oil did grow 0.5% month on month in December, but they were only flat over the fourth quarter,\u201d he said. Britain struggled to improve its export performance last year against the backdrop of a high pound and increasing concerns that the global economy is heading for a severe recession. Recent declines in the value of sterling are expected to support exports sales, though the deteriorating global situation could mitigate against an improved exchange rate. Paul Hollingsworth, a UK analyst at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe UK is clearly not immune to a weaker external environment. However, we think that concerns about a sharp global slowdown are somewhat overdone \u2013 indeed we think global growth will accelerate this year. What\u2019s more, the 5% or so fall in trade-weighted sterling since around mid-November should help exporters perform better in time. \u201cNonetheless, any progress in reducing the trade deficit is likely to be extremely slow in the near term, leaving the recovery reliant on domestic demand.\u201d Over the last quarter, chemicals exports fell by \u00a3900m to \u00a312.1bn while oil exports dropped by 9% to \u00a34.7bn. The ONS said these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the export of aircraft, which rose by 31% to \u00a33.6bn.",

    "webTitle": "Global oil glut set to worsen, says IEA", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The global oil glut is larger than previously thought and the risk of prices falling further has increased, the International Energy Agency has said. In its monthly report, the IEA warned that the recent respite was likely to be a \u201cfalse dawn\u201d and market conditions were weaker than the agency believed when it predicted last month the world could drown in supply. The agency issued its gloomy commentary as Goldman Sachs predicted further volatile price swings and said oil could fall to less than $20 a barrel as global storage capacity runs out. The price of oil has risen since it tumbled to a 13-year low in January. After falling below $28 a barrel, Brent crude climbed to more than $35 at the end of last month, though that was less than a third of the $115 peak in summer 2014. The IEA said renewed optimism about the oil price was overdone because stocks were increasing faster than predicted. The agency, which advises industralised countries, said this was because: a deal between Opec and other oil producing countries to cut production is unlikely with Iran increasing production in preparation for the lifting of sanctions, Opec\u2019s production could rise as strongly this year as in 2015 there is little prospect falling prices encouraging a pick-up in the rate of demand for oil the US dollar is likely to remain strong, limiting the scope for falls in the cost of imported oil the predicted large fall in US shale production is taking a long time to materialise The IEA said global oil stocks were likely to build by 2m barrels a day in the first quarter of 2016 and 1.5m barrels a day in the second quarter, with stocks continuing to rise in the second half of the year. The Paris-based agency said: \u201cWe suggest that the surplus of supply over demand in the early part of 2016 is even greater than we said in last month\u2019s oil market report. If these numbers prove to be accurate, and with the market already awash in oil, it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term. In these conditions the short-term risk to the downside has increased.\u201d Some analysts have said oil could sink to as low as $10 a barrel before traders decide the price has fallen far enough. The IEA said this view could prove to be too fevered but that there were few reasons for optimism. Goldman Sachs\u2019s head of commodities research, Jack Currie, said more price gyrations were ahead for oil and that the price of crude could drop below $20. With storage exhausted in some places, prices may have to drop low enough to halt crude output that can no longer be stockpiled, Currie told Bloomberg News. \u201cOnce you breach storage capacity, prices have to spike below cash costs because you have to shut in production almost immediately,\u201d Currie said. He predicted volatility would increase and said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised if this market goes into the teens\u201d. Oil\u2019s recent rise was driven by hopes that Opec might do a deal with Russia to cut production. Opec, led by Saudi Arabia, has kept pumping oil to protect its share of the global market while attempting to make production unviable for US shale producers. The IEA said: \u201cPersistent speculation about a deal between Opec and leading non-Opec producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation. It is Opec\u2019s business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low,.\u201d The agency trimmed its forecast for 2016 demand growth, which now stands at 1.17m barrels a day after hitting a five-year high of 1.6m in 2015. Global demand for oil is increasing but it has not been enough to absorb the amount of crude left over from weakening Chinese demand. Unwanted oil has been put into storage, creating record global stockpiles of more than 3bn barrels. The IEA said last month that holding surplus oil in tankers at sea might be necessary as storage space on land becomes scarce.",

The agency, which advises industralised countries, said this was because: </p> <ul> <li>a deal between Opec and other oil producing countries to cut production is unlikely</li> <li>with Iran increasing production in preparation for the lifting of sanctions, Opec\u2019s production could rise as strongly this year as in 2015</li> <li>there is little prospect falling prices encouraging a pick-up in the rate of demand for oil </li> <li>the US dollar is likely to remain strong, limiting the scope for falls in the cost of imported oil</li> <li>the predicted large fall in US shale production is taking a long time to materialise</li> </ul> <p>The IEA said global oil stocks were likely to build by 2m barrels a day in the first quarter of 2016 and 1.5m barrels a day in the second quarter, with stocks continuing to rise in the second half of the year.</p> <p>The Paris-based agency said: \u201cWe suggest that the surplus of supply over demand in the early part of 2016 is even greater than we said in last month\u2019s oil market report. If these numbers prove to be accurate, and with the market already awash in oil, it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term. In these conditions the short-term risk to the downside has increased.\u201d<br></p> <p>Some analysts have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/sell-everything-ahead-of-stock-market-crash-say-rbs-economists\">said oil could sink to as low as $10 a barrel</a> before traders decide the price has fallen far enough.

Opec, led by Saudi Arabia, has kept pumping oil to protect its share of the global market while attempting to make production unviable for US shale producers.<br></p> <p>The IEA said: \u201cPersistent speculation about a deal between Opec and leading non-Opec producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation. It is Opec\u2019s business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low,.\u201d</p> <p>The agency trimmed its forecast for 2016 demand growth, which now stands at 1.17m barrels a day after hitting a five-year high of 1.6m in 2015.<br></p> <p>Global demand for oil is increasing but it has not been enough to absorb the amount of crude left over from weakening Chinese demand. Unwanted oil has been put into storage, creating record global stockpiles of more than 3bn barrels. The IEA said last month that holding surplus oil in tankers at sea might be necessary as storage space on land becomes scarce.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets have been in turmoil since the start of the year, falling sharply as investors worry about the economic outlook, the slump in oil prices and concerns that central banks could run out of ammunition to cope with a downturn. Commodity companies are under pressure after a slowdown in China, while banks have been hit by the arrival of negative interest rates and fears about their exposure to struggling sectors of the economy. So the FTSE 100 has fallen 9% so far this year to hit its lowest level since November 2012, the Eurofirst 300 has lost 14.4%, the Nikkei is down 15.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 8%. But some markets have bucked the downward trend, even if they are not completely immune to the current volatility. Latvia The Baltic state is expected to approve a new government this week, which has pushed the Riga stock market up 4.2% in the first weeks of the year, despite worries about the effect of the Middle East refugee crisis and uncertainty over Russian intentions towards the country. It has reformed its tax system and, despite sanctions on Russia hitting its exports, it has one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe, with GDP up by 2.6% in the fourth quarter. Slovakia The economy has recovered strongly since the global financial crisis, with growth of 3.6% in 2015, which has helped push its stock market up 4.1% this year. The country is particularly strong in car production, the world\u2019s largest producer per capita, making more than 1m VW, Peugot Citro\u00ebn and Kia vehicles last year. Three car plants are already in production and a fourth - for Jaguar Land Rover - is expected to come on stream in 2018. Indonesia The Jakarta composite index has climbed 3.8% so far this year, boosted by a better-than-expected performance from its economy at the end of 2015. Fourth-quarter GDP grew by 5.04% as government spending on infrastructure and construction outweighed the effects of weak exports and consumption, up from 4.74% in the previous three months. Local investors have been encouraged by steps taken by President Joko Widodo late last year to boost investment and simplify the country\u2019s complex regulatory system. Colombia The stock market has climbed 1.8% this year despite the oil price fall hitting exports. However, it is still one of the top performers in the region, and hopes of successful peace talks in March have also given support, with the promise of more aid from the likes of the World Bank to come. Thailand The military government has also taken steps to increase spending and investment and lift a flagging economy. But a recent pick-up in consumer demand allowed the country\u2019s central bank to leave interest rates on hold rather than cut them, helping to support the banking sector. So the SET index has risen 1.24% since January.",

      "bodyText": "One of the oddest things about 2016, so far at least, is how economic common sense is being twisted in all sorts of ways to explain what\u2019s going on in the global economy. By the end of 2015 market commentators were clamouring for an interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve to restore confidence. Normally, the only reason to raise rates is if there is inflation in the economy and you want to squeeze it out. Problem: there was no inflation in the US, or almost anywhere else, at the end of 2015. So despite that rather obvious fact, the markets got the rise that they wanted and \u2026 it helped lower economic activity, precisely as one would expect, which has had a decidedly negative impact on confidence. Generally speaking, when you make something more expensive \u2013 in this case, money \u2013 people buy less of it. But in this world, \u201cthe markets\u201d were arguing that people would buy more of something if you made it more expensive, and that would produce confidence, so they would buy more, which is a bit odd, to say the least. The next bit of oddness, apparent as we entered into 2016, was that the fall in commodity prices, especially oil, was not good news. Yet falling commodity prices means that everyone who is not a commodity producer or an oil company pays less for their inputs, and can then spend more on other stuff, which has to be good \u2013 right? But the markets, once again, figured different. Falling oil prices were now seen as a bad thing, with markets in January having a mini heart attack as oil prices fell below $30 a barrel. When pressed as to why this was a bad thing, no one in these markets seemed to have a clear answer. But the markets freaked out anyway. A cause for this volatility had to be found, and it was, by the middle of January, in the form of China\u2019s banking sector. And so for the past month the markets have been fretting about the non-performing Loans (NPL\u2019s) in China \u2026 and their \u201cdodgy\u201d economic statistics. But just last year the IMF, who has plenty of data on NPL\u2019s everywhere, brought the yuan into its basket of reserve currencies, which is hardly what you would do if you thought it was all going to pot. After all, China\u2019s statistics and loan book have been questionable for years \u2026 but so has Italy\u2019s and Ireland for that matter. And China has literally trillions of dollars (and other currencies) in reserves to throw at the problem \u2013 not to mention a decidedly non-democratic state that can, and often does, just make things go away. So why is China now the cause of all ills? Along with China, cheap money, and everything else? Quite possibly because the world has changed, fundamentally, and financial markets are incentivised not to recognise this. Today there is no inflation anywhere that isn\u2019t due to a currency collapse brought on when the country that issues the currency is heavily dependent on imports, such as Russia and Brazil. Globalisation, and concerted action for 30 years by the political right, has killed the ability of labour to demand higher wages, hence record inequality and super low inflation. Meanwhile, yields on assets, and interest rates in such a world, will stay long and low well beyond 2016 as global savings outpace global investment, and everyone except the US tries to run an export surplus. This is an ugly world for financial markets, used to delivering the types of returns that people thought normal before the crash: 6 to 8%, liquid, and abundant. That money was made in a period when interest rates and inflation rates across the world fell year on year from abnormally high levels. In that world it was hard not to make money. But now we find ourselves in a post-crisis world in which the old tricks no longer work despite growth at 1.5%, inflation at 0.5% and interest rates in some places at minus 0.25%. Rather than face this fact, the markets blame China, this week, or it\u2019s the Fed\u2019s rate policy, last month, or its quantitative easing (another bete noire for markets of long standing). But here\u2019s the bad news. It\u2019s not their fault. Long and low as far as you go driven by ageing populations in developed countries that save more than they spend pushing down interest rates and consumption to the point of deflation as everyone tries to run a surplus is the reality of the world today. So what will the rest of 2016 look like? Just like we have seen so far \u2013 periodic inexplicable and what the heck moments as markets everywhere hunt for causes to explain away something very inconvenient. That the game has changed for financial markets \u2013 that there is no going back to the boom times \u2013 and that the world going forward is a much more boring, and much less finance friendly place, than the markets want to admit. Most of all to themselves. Mark Blyth is Eastman professor of political economy at Brown University",

      "bodyText": "Anxiety in global markets and a weakening US economy will force the Bank of England to delay UK interest rate rises until at least 2020, according to a leading firm of analysts. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) forecast, which will cheer mortgage borrowers and disappoint savers, extends by at least three years the timeline for the central bank\u2019s first increase from the historically low 0.5%. Most analysts have forecast a first rise in the base rate for almost seven years towards the end of this year or early 2017. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said last month that the UK faced \u201ca powerful set of forces\u201d that prevented policymakers from raising rates. However, Carney used his quarterly inflation report briefing to say that interest rates were \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to go up over the next two years. Danielle Haralambous and Aengus Collins, analysts at the EIU, said Carney\u2019s statement was at odds with the downbeat analysis in the inflation report. \u201cWe now expect record-low interest rates to remain in place in the UK for at least the next four years,\u201d they said. In the last week the Bank has downgraded the UK\u2019s expected GDP growth in 2016 and signalled that inflation will remain low this year and in 2017. Trade data shows that Britain has struggled to improve its exports against the headwinds of a stronger currency and nervous global markets, especially among emerging economies. The EIU analysts said downward revisions to official growth data revealed that the loss of momentum last year was sharper than expected. They also argued that the UK suffered from \u201cunresolved structural weaknesses\u201d that would prevent wages from accelerating and from putting pressure on prices. \u201cThe vulnerability of the UK recovery, combined with the more decisively dovish tone at the BoE, has led to a significant change in our call on monetary policy. We no longer expect tightening to begin in the final quarter of this year. We now expect the BoE to hold off on tightening for the next four years at least,\u201d they said. A decision to maintain low rates will prevail despite a build up in inflationary pressures, they said. \u201cThe BoE is likely to delay policy tightening in 2019, largely on the basis of our forecasts that the US will experience a downturn in 2019, and rising levels of indebtedness in China will have become a greater source of risk by the end of our forecast period. Our view is that the next increase in interest rates will come in mid-2020.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "London black-cab drivers have rejected an apparent olive branch from Uber as a \u201cPR stunt\u201d after the taxi-hailing app company said it would extend its service free to the traditional trade. Uber has modified its app to allow black-cab drivers in London to be available as a choice for its customers, with zero commission, for the next 12 months. But the LTDA, representing cab drivers, said it would be \u201camazed\u201d if any took up the offer, with other black-cab apps already available. Uber said it was trying to take the heat out of a debate that has become increasingly fraught, including court battles and strikes by cab drivers \u2013 who are planning further action on Wednesday. Jo Bertram, Uber\u2019s UK general manager, said: \u201cWe believe that black cabs and Uber can coexist \u2026 As even the most avid Uber users know, there are many times when a black cab is the fastest and best option because it is literally right there on the street in front of you. There is zero waiting time and you can whizz along the bus lane. \u201cWe also believe that Uber can help black cabs reach new passengers so they get more custom.\u201d Uber\u2019s change will allow black cabs to appear on the app, and be chosen by users who would pay electronically through their phone. Bertram said it was a chance for black-cab drivers to get a fare when there were no passengers on the street or they were waiting in a long queue at a rank. But McNamara said: \u201cWith over 15,000 cabbies registered with specific taxi-hailing apps like Gett and Hailo, we would be amazed if any drivers decide to take up Uber\u2019s offer. Licensed taxis in London offer the best service in the world and, as a membership group, the LTDA doesn\u2019t like the way Uber treats its drivers and customers or its dodgy tax arrangements. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been consulted on this at all: it\u2019s just another PR stunt from a company that spends \u00a3250,000 every month on lobbying and PR. The response is \u2018thanks, but no thanks\u2019.\u201d About 5,000 taxi drivers plan to protest in London on Wednesday over deregulation of the trade, which black-cab drivers believe favours private hire firms with \u201clight touch\u201d checks. Unite, the union representing many of London\u2019s 25,000 taxi drivers, said the issues in the capital extended throughout the UK. It claims a flooded market, with about 10,000 new drivers a year being licensed in the city, was driving down standards and putting passenger safety at risk. A Unite representative, Jim Kelly, said: \u201cWe feel that Uber exploits its drivers by using their self-employed status to extract maximum income from them which translates to those drivers working long hours. The reduction in safety for passengers because of the \u2018light touch\u2019 regime is to be deplored. It is a race to the bottom \u2013 when in 2016 we want the highest possible standards. \u201cThe London taxi fleet is 100% wheelchair accessible. There is no compulsion on private hire operators, such as Uber, to provide for these passengers.\u201d",

There is zero waiting time and you can whizz along the bus lane.</p> <p>\u201cWe also believe that Uber can help black cabs reach new passengers so they get more custom.\u201d</p> <p>Uber\u2019s change will allow black cabs to appear on the app, and be chosen by users who would pay electronically through their phone. Bertram said it was a chance for black-cab drivers to get a fare when there were no passengers on the street or they were waiting in a long queue at a rank.</p> <p>But McNamara said: \u201cWith over 15,000 cabbies registered with specific taxi-hailing apps like Gett and Hailo, we would be amazed if any drivers decide to take up Uber\u2019s offer. Licensed taxis in London offer the best service in the world and, as a membership group, the LTDA doesn\u2019t like the way Uber treats its drivers and customers or its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/29/londons-black-cab-drivers-consider-court-action-against-uber\">dodgy tax arrangements.</a></p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been consulted on this at all: it\u2019s just another PR stunt from a company that spends \u00a3250,000 every month on lobbying and PR. The response is \u2018thanks, but no thanks\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>About 5,000 taxi drivers plan to protest in London on Wednesday over deregulation of the trade, which black-cab drivers believe favours private hire firms with \u201clight touch\u201d checks. </p> <p>Unite, the union representing many of London\u2019s 25,000 taxi drivers, said the issues in the capital extended throughout the UK. It claims a flooded market, with about 10,000 new drivers a year being licensed in the city, was driving down standards and putting passenger safety at risk. </p> <p>A Unite representative, Jim Kelly, said: \u201cWe feel that Uber exploits its drivers by using their self-employed status to extract maximum income from them which translates to those drivers working long hours. The reduction in safety for passengers because of the \u2018light touch\u2019 regime is to be deplored. It is a race to the bottom \u2013 when in 2016 we want the highest possible standards.</p> <p>\u201cThe London taxi fleet is 100% wheelchair accessible. There is no compulsion on private hire operators, such as Uber, to provide for these passengers.\u201d</p>",

The UK performed slightly ahead of the rest of Tui\u2019s business, with bookings for the current winter 3% higher, compared with a flat market overall. The contrast is even more marked for summer bookings, with the UK up 9% compared with a 1% increase across the company. The UK had been partly boosted by the strength of the pound against the euro, Tui said.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England should move quick to quash any rapid growth in credit, one of its deputy governors has said. Sir Jon Cunliffe told an audience of property developers that credit was growing at almost the same rate as the economy after contracting in the years immediately after the banking crisis. He said: \u201cIf [credit] were to resume growing more than twice as fast as GDP, it could take a number of years for debt to income to retain its pre-crisis peak. But just as financial cycles build up over a number of years, the risks they pose are perhaps best managed over time. \u201cGiven the vulnerability that already exists and the powerful drivers in the UK, particularly in the housing market, if credit began again to grow faster than GDP, I would want to think about action to manage the financial stability risks sooner rather than later.\u201d The rate of credit growth has not reached the levels of the 10 years before the crisis. During the decade until 2007, credit growth was more than double the rate of growth in the economy; at its peak in 2009, credit was 177% of GDP. Cunliffe said most of this lending was to UK households. The stock of households\u2019 debt relative to their income surged from the late 1990s to 155% by 2007. It fell to 135% in 2012 and remains at that level. He sits on the financial policy committee \u2013 set up inside the Bank of England by the last government to look for risks to the financial system \u2013 and said it was up to the FPC to monitor the credit cycle. \u201cNow is a good time to ask: what lay behind the very rapid expansion of credit in the 10 years before the crisis. Should we expect \u2013 or want \u2013 credit to return to its pre-crisis path of growing nearly twice as fast as GDP? This is an important question for the financial policy committee as it assesses the level of financial stability risk in the UK economy \u2013 where we are in the so-called \u2018financial cycle\u2019?\u201d The aim is not to stifle growth entirely. \u201cThe issue, rather, is what are the financial stability and broader economic risks for the UK if credit consistently grows faster than GDP and as a result, debt-to-income resumes its upward path? That cannot continue indefinitely. Trees cannot grow to the sky,\u201d he said. The FPC has powers to restrict the amount of mortgage lending to highly indebted individuals and can also rein in sectors it regards as riskier.",

But just as financial cycles build up over a number of years, the risks they pose are perhaps best managed over time. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/09/market-turmoil-nikkei-plunges-european-stocks-germany-ftse-live\">Market turmoil: European markets fall again after Japan's 5% rout \u2013 live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cGiven the vulnerability that already exists and the powerful drivers in the UK, particularly in the housing market, if credit began again to grow faster than GDP, I would want to think about action to manage the financial stability risks sooner rather than later.\u201d</p> <p>The rate of credit growth has not reached the levels of the 10 years before the crisis. During the decade until 2007, credit growth was more than double the rate of growth in the economy; at its peak in 2009, credit was 177% of GDP.</p> <p>Cunliffe said most of this lending was to UK households. The stock of households\u2019 debt relative to their income surged from the late 1990s to 155% by 2007. It fell to 135% in 2012 and remains at that level. He sits on the financial policy committee \u2013 set up inside the Bank of England by the last government to look for risks to the financial system \u2013 and said it was up to the FPC to monitor the credit cycle.</p> <p>\u201cNow is a good time to ask: what lay behind the very rapid expansion of credit in the 10 years before the crisis. Should we expect \u2013 or want \u2013 credit to return to its pre-crisis path of growing nearly twice as fast as GDP? This is an important question for the financial policy committee as it assesses the level of financial stability risk in the UK economy \u2013 where we are in the so-called \u2018financial cycle\u2019?\u201d </p> <p>The aim is not to stifle growth entirely. \u201cThe issue, rather, is what are the financial stability and broader economic risks for the UK if credit consistently grows faster than GDP and as a result, debt-to-income resumes its upward path? That cannot continue indefinitely. Trees cannot grow to the sky,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The FPC has powers to restrict the amount of mortgage lending to highly indebted individuals and can also rein in sectors it regards as riskier.</p>",

Sales rose 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 31 January, compared with a 0.2% fall in the three months to 3 January, despite continued price cuts, according to the latest industry data from Kantar Worldpanel. Fresh fruit and vegetable sales rose by about 5% while fish, poultry and nuts saw similar growth. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cConsumers are clearly striving for a healthier start to the year and have turned to fresh foods.\u201d Discounters Aldi and Lidl, both of which have been flagging deals on fresh fruit and vegetables in recent weeks, were the main beneficiaries. They accelerated growth slightly to 13.7% and 18.7%, increasing their market share by 0.7 percentage points each to 5.6% and 4.2%. Their influence, as well as commodity deflation, underpinned a 1.6% year-on-year fall in grocery prices \u2013 a slight improvement on the 1.8% seen over Christmas. For the first time since 2011, the Co-op was the fastest growing traditional grocer with a 1.4% rise in sales. The chain is benefiting as shoppers switch towards visiting smaller local stores, rather than one big shop at an out-of-town supermarket, as well as its own efforts to improve its service. Asda\u2019s difficulties continued with sales slumping by 3.8%, worse than the 3.5% fall revealed by Kantar for the previous period, and by far the worst performer in the market. The pressure is ramping up on Asda boss Andy Clarke, who next week will reveal the chain\u2019s sales performance for the quarter covering Christmas. It has lost 0.7 percentage points of market share since last year to 16.2%, putting it well behind Sainsbury\u2019s 16.8%. Sainsbury\u2019s was the only one of the main \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets to achieve sales growth \u2013 with sales up 0.6% over the three month period. But Tesco and Morrisons both managed to slow sales declines, in good news for the turnaround hopes of their chief executives Dave Lewis and David Potts.

In the wake of the current market turmoil and \u201cfollowing a number of enquiries from....analysts and investors\u201d the group has clarified its exposure on its bond portfolio, which seems to have reassured investors. Its shares are up 8.5p or 4% at 211.5p as it said only 1.2% of the portfolio was in basic resources and 5.2% in oil and gas. Investors have been concerned about the exposure of investment groups and banks to the commodities sector after the tumbling oil price and falling mining shares. Analyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital issued a buy note, saying: In a move to allay fears in the market over its bond portfolio, Legals has set out an up-to-date split of its book as at the end of December 2015. The portfolio amounted to around \u00a339bn at the end of the year, down from \u00a340.7bn at the end of 2014. By credit rating, around 4% was AAA, 28% was AA, 33% was A, BBB accounted for 31% and the balance was BB or below \u2013 to us, this is a sign of the level of security within the portfolio and the conservative approach taken by the fund managers. These figures do not vary greatly compared to the end of 2014, with the extra detail offered being the breakdown of the \u2018industrials\u2019 line to separate \u2018oil &amp; gas\u2019 and \u2018basic resources\u2019. Not only are these figures low, around 5% and 1% respectively, we believe them to be of strong quality. This disclosure should nail concerns in the market over this exposure. Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon said: We welcome the clarity, which should reassure, but are surprised that L&amp;G felt the need to respond to analyst calls in this way so close to the prelim announcement. The positive news from Legal has helped the FTSE 100 regain some ground, up 33.49 points at 5722.85. But the index is still close to three year lows, and the mood remains fragile as investors fret over the global economy, and in particular the outlook for the stressed banking sector, especially with interest rates in negative territory in some cases. After Monday\u2019s slide in the banking sector, things are a little calmer. Lloyds Banking Group is up 0.5p at 59.86p but Barclays has edged down 0.75p at 163.15p. Mining shares are the big losers despite a 1.7% rise in crude oil prices. Antofagasta has fallen 24.5p to 428.9p and Anglo American is down 13.85p at 362.25p. Tui Group has lost 19p to \u00a310.79 as the travel group said summer holiday bookings to Turkey were down 40% due to security worries. Mike McCudden at stockbroker Interactive Investor said: Thanks to the valiant late recovery on Wall St, investors are largely ignoring Asian market falls and pushing the share indices higher this morning. However, while the banks remain under pressure the next panic sell off could just be around the corner. Janet Yellen?s testimony this week will be under even more scrutiny than usual and those without the stomach for some extreme volatility may well be advised to take a back seat.",

      "bodyText": "Panic hit global stock markets for a second day as shares plunged in Asia and Europe on fears that the global economy is heading for recession. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index tumbled throughout the day in a wave of panic selling. The fall wiped 918 points off the Nikkei, leaving it down 5.5% at 16,085, the biggest one-day plunge in three years. Recession jitters affected other Asian markets and caused Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 to fall by 2.8%. Markets fell again in Europe after Monday\u2019s sell-off wiped \u00a340bn from the value of leading shares in London. The FTSE 100 rose briefly but then fell 26 points to 5,666 after half an hour of trading. Banks led the rout in Japan amid concerns about the sector in an environment of negative interest rates. In Europe, Italian lenders led a second day of heavy declines because of worries about their bad debts. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena was the biggest casualty, dropping more than 7%. The Stoxx 600 Banks index, which tracks financial stocks across Europe, fell 1.7%, adding to a 5.6% decline on Monday. Europe\u2019s bank sector has lost a quarter of its value this year as fears of a global downturn have damaged market valuations. Investors have dumped shares and bought the safer assets of gold and government bonds as the panic that marked the start to trading in 2016 resumed. Analysts have compared conditions with those that existed before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 plunged the world into recession. Figures from Germany added to the grim outlook for the global economy. Industrial output plunged unexpectedly in December and exports and imports fell in a sign that Europe\u2019s largest economy is weakening. The Dax index of leading German shares fell 21 points to 8,959 and France\u2019s CAC 40 index also fell. Concerns over the impact of negative interest rates on banks\u2019 profits have undermined confidence in the sector after central banks in Europe and Japan hinted in January that already low interest rates could be cut further. Deutsche Bank rose 2% after Germany\u2019s biggest bank attempted to reassure investors that it would meet bond payments in April. Deutsche was the main casualty of the European banking rout on Monday, falling nearly 10% on fears about its finances. Markets have tumbled amid fears about Chinese economic growth and falling oil prices. There is also speculation that the US Federal Reserve could change course on interest rates in response to weakening signals from the world\u2019s biggest economy. Analysts at Citi investment bank said: \u201cThe \u2018fear factor\u2019 in markets has morphed from being about an emerging market hard-landing and collapsing oil prices to being about the extent of the slowdown in the developed world and the ability of central banks to reflate asset values yet again.\u201d In Japan, the yield, or interest rate on Japanese 10-year government bonds, turned negative for the first time, meaning investors were prepared to pay the government to lend it money for the next decade. The development demonstrated investors\u2019 wariness about all but the safest assets, as well as the impact of the Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise decision to charge banks for additional deposits at the central bank. The move was designed to support the economy as fears of a global slowdown increased. Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG, said it was a \u201cday of trauma\u201d and that the global sell-off was likely to continue with banks once more in the line of fire. He added: \u201cThere is huge demand for portfolio protection in all asset classes and it just doesn\u2019t feel like we are going to see a major turn anytime soon. One can then do a sense check as to what will effectively turn this juggernaut of pain around and this is not a question that is readily answered.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Japan\u2019s Nikkei index plummeted more than 950 points on Tuesday, its biggest loss in one day since May 2013, as the fears over the global economy saw a continuation of the previous day\u2019s selloff in Europe and the US. The Nikkei dived 5.1% to 16,132.25 in morning trading and extended losses into the afternoon, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 fell 2.6% to 4,946.70. Markets were also down in the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and New Zealand. The yen meanwhile briefly soared to a 14-month high against the US dollar. The MSCI\u2019s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1% and might have fallen further had several Asian markets not been closed. Markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea were closed for Lunar New Year holidays. Most markets in the region will re-open from Wednesday, with Chinese markets returning next week. The volatility affecting global markets last month appears set to continue amid concern about Chinese economic growth, falling oil prices and speculation that the US federal reserve could change course with interest rates. \u201cThe combination of concerns that the United States could be heading toward a recession and the global stock sell-off is curbing risk appetite and is sending investors to the safe-haven yen,\u201d Takuya Takahashi, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities, told Kyodo News. After hovering around the 117-yen line on Monday, the Japanese currency briefly rose to the upper 114 zone to its strongest level against the dollar since November 2014. Investors regard the yen as a \u201csave haven\u201d currency when global markets are hit by the kind of turmoil witnessed in recent weeks. The yen is expected to make further gains \u2013 a trend that eats into the repatriated profits of Japanese auto and other exporters. Three-month dollar/yen implied volatility \u2013 which indicates how much currency movement is expected in the months ahead - reached 12.137% its highest since September 2013. Responding to the yen\u2019s rise, Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso, told reporters: \u201cIt is clear that recent moves in the market have been rough. We will continue to carefully monitor developments in the currency market.\u201d The dollar was last at 115.26 yen, down 0.6%, after dropping as low as 114.75. Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo, described it as a \u201cpanic situation\u201d. Ogino added that investors would be closely watching the US federal reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to the house financial services committee on Wednesday for any clues that the central bank might be prepared to slow future rate hikes as market turbulence and global economic uncertainty continue. \u201cThe focus is now on Yellen\u2019s comments tomorrow, and how she\u2019ll respond to these latest market conditions,\u201d Ogino said. The flight to safety also saw Japanese government bond yields dive below zero for the first time, extending a downtrend sparked by the Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise move last month to adopt negative interest rates on some commercial lenders\u2019 deposits. \u201cThe Nikkei has been well and truly savaged today,\u201d said Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG in Melbourne. \u201cIt is clear that strong buying in the Japanese government bond market is not going to drive the (yen) weaker in times of extreme volatility, so negative rates have little bearing on markets.\u201d The Bank of Japan\u2019s rates decision has prompted fears that after years of monetary easing, central banks have few avenues left to explore to encourage investment and boost growth. Talk of an impending recession in the US, however, is creating speculation among investors that the federal reserve will put on hold its attempts to normalise rates. \u201cThe \u2018fear factor\u2019 in markets has morphed from being about an emerging market hard-landing and collapsing oil prices to being about the extent of the slowdown in the developed world and the ability of central banks to reflate asset values yet again,\u201d said analysts at Citi in a note. The pessimism isn\u2019t universal, however. In a report released at the weekend, Goldman Sachs said there was just a 25% risk that recession would hit industrialised economies in the next year, rising to 34% over the next two years. Both forecasts fall below the average risk seen in the past 35 years, despite the turmoil in financial markets. In the US, the probability of a recession in the next four quarters is just 18%, and 24 in the eurozone, according to the US bank\u2019s economics team.",

In a report released at the weekend, Goldman Sachs said there was just a 25% risk <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/goldman-sachs-says-defy-mr-market-as-recession-risk-still-low\">that recession would hit </a>industrialised economies in the next year, rising to 34% over the next two years.</p> <p>Both forecasts fall below the average risk seen in the past 35 years, despite the turmoil in financial markets. In the US, the probability of a recession in the next four quarters is just 18%, and 24 in the eurozone, according to the US bank\u2019s economics team.<br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inside the offices that nestle within the old warehouse buildings of Liverpool\u2019s Baltic Triangle, which house many of the city\u2019s nascent digital technology companies, there\u2019s a sense of purpose and industry. Liverpool is classed as having a tech cluster, which means, according to a report out this Thursday, its digital industries stand a good chance of growing faster and generating higher salaries than in much of the rest of the country. \u201cThere\u2019s money here,\u201d says Leo Cubbin, co-founder of Liverpool-based Ripstone, the creator of computer games such as Pure Chess and Ironcast. Fellow founder, Phil Gaskell, nods in agreement. The pair are talking in a small meeting room about the 14 or so private shareholders who have backed his company. Many of them are high net worth individuals based locally and a well-known figure from the football industry is advising on future finance. Ripstone, which seeks \u00a32m for further growth, is located in the heart of the Triangle, a development area overlooking the river Mersey with a skyline on one side dominated by the city\u2019s imposing Anglican cathedral. Liverpool has a history of video game making, dating to the studios owned by Sony, Bizarre Creations and Evolution. However, Studio Liverpool, famous for its Wipeout series of racing games, closed in 2012, leaving about 100 games experts looking for jobs or companies to found. Now it is home to a cluster of games companies that feature prominently in the narrative of the state of Britain\u2019s digital economy as portrayed in the Tech Nation report by Tech City UK, the government-backed initiative. This is what the London-focused Tech City has broadened into now the government has decided to promote the growth of digital startups around the country, rather than just in Shoreditch and surrounding areas in the east of the capital. In his new year\u2019s message, the digital economy minister said the industry was expanding around the UK. \u201cDigital fever has exploded from the cluster in east London, and has spread to every part of the country, making the UK truly a Tech Nation with more than 70% of digital businesses now based outside of the capital,\u201d Ed Vaizey said. Doubts about the government\u2019s commitment to Tech North, the northern offshoot, were raised recently, when Claire Braithwaite, its passionate chief executive, resigned after less than a year in the job. Herb Kim, the executive chairman who is filling in during the interim, promises that the commitment to spreading the digital economy outside London remains as strong as ever. For all its efforts at regeneration, Liverpool remains an embodiment of the north-south divide in terms of pure economics statistics. The employment rate is 61.2% compared with an average in UK cities of 71%. Output per person in terms of gross value added is \u00a322,092, compared with \u00a342,666 in London. House prices in the north-west average \u00a3183,000 compared with \u00a3531,000 in the south-east. With such disparities in wealth and income, some believe the government should be doing more to encourage digital firms in order to help bridge the gaping north-south divide. The latest Centre for Cities study classifies 29 of 63 cities in the UK as having low-wage, high-welfare economies \u2013 including Liverpool. The urban policy thinktank\u2019s chief executive, Alexandra Jones, applauds the focus on the digital sector in northern cities such as Liverpool, but says education and training also need to be addressed if such initiatives are to contribute a real increase in long-term economic growth. \u201cRather than artificially encouraging businesses to move \u2013 a policy that has historically had low success rates \u2013 the first priority should be addressing skills-gaps across the north,\u201d she says. \u201cLiverpool, for example, has one of the highest proportions of residents with no formal qualifications in the UK, and also has very low rates of GCSE attainment. Improving skills levels should be a central part of the government\u2019s \u2019northern powerhouse\u2019 initiative and should also be a key concern for local policymakers.\u201d Gaskell also thinks more could be done in terms of incentives. \u201cThe government is great at subsidising plant and machinery and other tangibles but in gaming we\u2019re just talking about people,\u201d he says. Jonathan Holmes, founder ofMilky Tea, a rival games maker based a few doors from Gaskell\u2019s office in the Baltic Triangle, tried working in London a few years ago but has since returned. The 37-year-old is positive about being back in his hometown. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of games talent that is on the doorstep,\u201d he says.\u200e \u201cPeople realise they can not be everything on their own ... I have loaned a coder and in return I have given up one of my animators for a period.\u201d Milky Tea\u2019s latest game, Coffin Dodgers, has just launched. Mike Humphrey is the design director of Starship. When the virtual reality social media company was set up by former Evolution founder Martin Kenwright in 2014 there was a great support network, he says. \u201cPeople lent us furniture, the [universities] lent us equipment. It\u2019s a really nice atmosphere.\u201d Humphrey and the others say they have a good relationship with the local Studio School, where students are taught video game making and are often mentored by local entrepreneurs. A tech sector with notable big names outside London has been a feature of the UK scene for many years. Sage, the FTSE 100 tech group, is based just outside Newcastle upon Tyne and, according to Tech Nation, 74% of technology companies are located outside the capital. Liverpool stands ahead of inner London in terms of the growth of newly formed digital companies, with a 119% rate compared with 92%. Bournemouth leads the country, with a growth rate of 212%, according to last year\u2019s Tech Nation report. Last month the Edinburgh-based travel website Skyscanner and the North Yorkshire-based Anaplan became the latest UK unicorns \u2013 privately owned tech companies valued at $1bn (\u00a3700m) or more \u2013 when they raised $192m and $90m respectively. Suranga Chandratillake, a venture capital partner at Balderton, says: \u201cThere are extremely strong clusters outside London. It is the right thing to promote these clusters.\u201d Balderton, whose past investments included Betfair and Bebo, has a stake in online retailer The Hut, based in the north-west and in the Exeter-based crowdfunding investment firm Crowdcube. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a natural gravitational pull towards London but that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be other clusters that might thrive. As an investor you need to get out to see companies,\u201d says Chandratillake. There is clearly an advantage in having lots of creative people based in a convivial low-cost region, with access to a decent sized talent pool. But to grow, fledgling companies also need an ecosystem including lawyers, financiers and media coverage. Holmes says that access to finance in Liverpool is tricky. \u201cInstead of running to London I am going over to the US. It seems to be easier to access finance there. British investors tend to like tangible products,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to put companies in the spotlight globally. We\u2019re terrible at shouting about what we do.\u201d Not everybody, however, supports a policy of actively encouraging the spread of digital startups around the country. Nic Brisbourne, managing partner of London-based technology investor Forward Partners, argues that it makes more sense to focus on the capital. \u201cToo much wealth inequality is unequivocally a bad thing and we desperately need to revive the less prosperous regions in the UK, but conflating regional development policy and startup ecosystem policy is a mistake that puts both at risk,\u201d he says. \u201cStartup ecosystems need a significant minimum scale to operate effectively and the London area ecosystem is now only approaching critical mass while other hubs are a long way off and unlikely to become sustainable in the short to medium term.\u201d There is also a word of warning from Stephen Nicol, a regional economics expert from Regeneris Consulting: \u201cIt\u2019s simply not realistic to expect every city in the UK to develop a genuine internationally competitive location for digital industries.\u201d Games creators such as Milky Tea\u2019s Holmes are not going to let any such scepticism stand in their way. \u201cI\u2019m determined to make it work here,\u201d he says. When Cubbin talks of money being around in Liverpool he is speaking in the context of the rather modest \u00a32m needed to fund his company\u2019s next stage. If Liverpool and the Baltic Triangle is ever going to be taken seriously as a globally competitive tech cluster it might need to create a couple of unicorns. \u201cThe key is to build resilience into the ecosystem,\u201d says Starship\u2019s chief operating officer, Clemens Wangerin, a veteran of the city\u2019s tech scene since his days at Studio Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of time, money and resources but mainly time. One thing\u2019s for sure, you need to be in the water to catch the wave.\u201d \u25cf This article was amended on Tuesday 9 February 2016. It originally stated incorrectly that Tech Nation was the government-backed initiative to promote technology startups. This body is called Tech City UK, which is publishing a report entitled Tech Nation.",

Nic Brisbourne, managing partner of London-based technology investor Forward Partners, argues that it makes more sense to focus on the capital.</p> <p>\u201cToo much wealth inequality is unequivocally a bad thing and we desperately need to revive the less prosperous regions in the UK, but conflating regional development policy and startup ecosystem policy is a mistake that puts both at risk,\u201d he says.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cStartup ecosystems need a significant minimum scale to operate effectively and the London area ecosystem is now only approaching critical mass while other hubs are a long way off and unlikely to become sustainable in the short to medium term.\u201d</p> <p>There is also a word of warning from Stephen Nicol, a regional economics expert from Regeneris Consulting: \u201cIt\u2019s simply not realistic to expect every city in the UK to develop a genuine internationally competitive location for digital industries.\u201d</p> <p>Games creators such as Milky Tea\u2019s Holmes are not going to let any such scepticism stand in their way. \u201cI\u2019m determined to make it work here,\u201d he says.</p> <p>When Cubbin talks of money being around in Liverpool he is speaking in the context of the rather modest \u00a32m needed to fund his company\u2019s next stage. If Liverpool and the Baltic Triangle is ever going to be taken seriously as a globally competitive tech cluster it might need to create a couple of unicorns. </p> <p>\u201cThe key is to build resilience into the ecosystem,\u201d says Starship\u2019s chief operating officer, Clemens Wangerin, a veteran of the city\u2019s tech scene since his days at Studio Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of time, money and resources but mainly time. One thing\u2019s for sure, you need to be in the water to catch the wave.\u201d</p> <p>\u25cf This article was amended on Tuesday 9 February 2016. It originally stated incorrectly that Tech Nation was the government-backed initiative to promote technology startups. This body is called Tech City UK, which is publishing a report entitled Tech Nation. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Telstra customers across Australia were unable to make or receive calls for two hours on Tuesday afternoon due to an \u201cembarrassing human error\u201d, the company has said. The systems failure meant customers nationwide were unable to access some services, with a third-party map showing its impact in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. A Telstra spokesman confirmed that the failure began at about 12.30pm AEDT and prevented customers from making and receiving calls. Data usage was affected for only a short period. Full services were restored by about 2.30pm. Chief operations officer Kate McKenzie told Nine News the failure was an \u201cembarrassing human error\u201d after a node, which manages network traffic, malfunctioned on Tuesday morning. A Telstra spokesman told Guardian Australia 10 nodes were subsequently taken out of action when no more than four can be taken down without affecting services. \u201cA lot more than that were worked on this morning ... which is human error.\u201d He said an investigation into how the problem occured was under way, and Telstra intended to offer customers free data to compensate for the inconvenience. Police and emergency services advised at the time of the failure that triple zero calls were not likely to be affected. Just before 3pm the company reported that the problem had been identified and services were gradually being restored. Until then Telstra\u2019s communications staff had their work cut out tweeting at irate Twitter users to thank them for their patience. One employee, Dani, valiantly tried to keep pace with Twitter users\u2019 helpful suggestions to try \u201cturning it off and on again\u201d. The shutdown also led this promotional image, from Telstra\u2019s Facebook page, to resurface. According to Twitter, the effects of the outage were wide-ranging and of variable consequence.",
