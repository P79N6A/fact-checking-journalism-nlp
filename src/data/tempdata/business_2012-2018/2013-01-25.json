      "bodyText": "The strategy has failed. The public knows it. The International Monetary Fund knows it. The credit rating agencies know it. Nick Clegg knows it. Even George Osborne knows it, although he can't bring himself to admit as much. Here is a brief resum\u00e9 of how things stand for the economy after two-and-a-half years of the coalition government. National output has just contracted for the fourth quarter in the last five. The only quarter of 2012 in which the economy expanded contained the London Olympics, and unfortunately for the chancellor these sort of jamborees happen once every half century, not every three months. During 2012 as a whole the economy registered no growth at all. Nothing. Zilch. A big fat zero. The only thing that has grown has been the list of ministerial excuses for the economy's stubborn failure to live up to their rosy expectations. We have had snow, floods, the Queen's diamond jubilee, the nuptials of her grandson, maintenance work on North Sea oil and gas platforms, Europe's debt crisis and the US fiscal cliff. If the economy slides again in the first quarter of 2013, doubtless it will time for snow to be trotted out once again. Yet this is not the first time it has snowed or rained. There have been other Jubilees, other occasions \u2013 such as the early 1980s and the 1930s \u2013 when the rest of the world was having its problems. Germany's national output is above where it was when the recession started. The same is true of America, where policy makers believe that growth leads to deficit reduction rather than the other way round. In Britain, GDP is more than 3% below its peak in early 2008, a weaker performance than the 1930s. RBS says the four-year performance of the economy between 2008 and 2012 is the weakest since the 1830s apart from postwar mobilisations. Industrial production was the main factor behind the drop in output in the final quarter of 2012, with factory output back to levels last seen in the early 1990s. Rebalancing is a pipedream. Unsurprisingly, the Treasury's deficit-reduction programme is well off track. This is an abysmal record. Osborne is quite right when he says the economy was in bad shape when he became chancellor. The life or death struggle of the eurozone has not helped growth prospects and rising commodity prices have acted as a brake on consumer spending. But the government also sucked demand out of the economy by raising taxes, cutting welfare and, as Clegg has admitted, by taking the axe to capital spending programmes. The blood-curdling rhetoric from Osborne in 2010 about Britain being a Greece in waiting shredded consumer and business confidence. Clearly, there is a risk the first quarter of 2013 will also be negative. The economy is fundamentally weak and the weather this past week will not have helped. Against this backdrop, there is mounting pressure for action. Boris Johnson's call for spending on homes and infrastructure was meant to demonstrate there are alternatives to the government's bankrupt approach. Osborne could use the budget to cut taxes and sanction spending on small-scale infrastructure projects that could be started immediately. In reality, changes to fiscal policy are likely to be small and cosmetic. Osborne will rely on the Bank of England to do the heavy lifting. Further monetary easing looks inevitable, even though a combination of 0.5% bank rate and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing has proved ineffective. The chancellor will cross his fingers and hope that the UK benefits from the slightly better news coming out of the US and China. Yet politically as well as economically, the figures are a disaster for the government. With the clock ticking towards a 2015 election, it ensures the next few months will be spent debating a possible triple-dip recession and how soon the credit rating agencies will strip Britain of its AAA credit rating. This looks inevitable and when it happens, Osborne's strategy will be in complete tatters.",

Regulators in America and Britain are examining emails between the former Deutsche Bank trader and a former Barclays trader to establish whether there was a plot to fix rates and boost the value of certain trades between 2006 and 2007, according to a Bloomberg report. Former traders at other banks \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and HSBC \u2013 are also under scrutiny. \"The Libor affair sickens us all,\" Jain said this week. \"I don't think any CEO thought this was a possibility. It sickens me the most of all the scandals.\" Nevertheless, a spokesman on Friday stressed that the trading strategy of those former Deutsche Bank traders under scrutiny was \"based on a legitimate market view that diversified and lowered the bank's portfolio risk during the peak of the financial crisis\". Deutsche Bank said it was adamant that \"to date we have found no link between the inappropriate conduct of a limited number of employees and the profits generated by these trades\". Separately, the identities of some 104 current and former Barclays staff referred to anonymously in regulatory documents outlining the bank's \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor have been released as part of an on-going case against the bank for mis-selling of interest-rate swaps. The finance director, Chris Lucas, and head of the investment bank, Rich Ricci, are on the list, as is the former head of compliance Stephen Morse, who has since moved on. Former chief executive Bob Diamond is also named. This list names bankers whose emails were reviewed by the various regulators investigating the rigging on the benchmark rate. They were released after former and current employees of the bank lost their attempt in the high court to keep their identities secret in a case of interest rate swap mis-selling led by Guardian Care Homes. In releasing the names, after an application by the media, the judge stressed that inclusion on the list did not imply they were implicated in any wrongdoing, and some were definitely not involved. Barclays is contesting the case. \"This started as an alleged mis-selling case, which the bank considers has no merit. The addition of a claim based on what happened with Libor does not change the bank's view. The fact that someone's documents were reviewed by the bank during its review of millions of documents does not mean that such person was involved in any wrongdoing.\"",

    "webTitle": "Has Apple really started to rot? | Nils Pratley on Saturday", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A little sympathy for Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, is in order. Following Steve Jobs was never going to be easy, but he has hardly been helped by the hype and expectation piled on the company. Yes, Apple exploits the mood merrily when it has a new gizmo to flog. But Wall Street as showbiz on steroids can be an absurd spectacle. At Apple, the machine has been in ridiculous overdrive for the past year. The first sign was analysts' competition to be the first to predict a $1,000 share price. Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets in the US was the winner, garnering publicity by declaring \"Apple fever is spreading like a wildfire around the world\". Others piled in. Given the size of the company and its weight in various indices, not owning the shares suddenly became a career risk for the average US fund manager. Who would want to be the fool who stood alone against the iPhone 5? At $700 the stock was clearly priced for perfection. After a small slip \u2013 a wonky mapping app \u2013 the machine went into reverse. With whizzy technology stocks there is no neutral gear \u2013they are either on their way to the moon, or they are ex-growth companies that have run out of ideas. So this week's numbers were greeted as evidence of the latter \u2013 a confirmation Apple has peaked. And it is true that quarterly profits were flat year on year at $13.1bn (\u00a38bn) and that the annual outcome could be the first decline for a decade. Higher manufacturing costs are a fact of life and Samsung, which has put in a dent in Apple's profit margins, is a formidable competitor. The shares fell another 12% to $450. But take a step back. After the ride on Wall Street's rollercoaster, Apple's shares stand almost exactly where they did a year ago. For a company in transition, that is hardly humiliation. The ex-growth label may sting but it is the rate of decline that matters. Middle age comes to everybody and handing out the winnings (Apple has $137bn in cash) in the form of dividends or buy-backs would be no disgrace. But can anybody really be confident Apple is ex-growth and the 48m iPhones sold in the past quarter represent a last hurrah? It is far too early to judge. The big event is the next product \u2013 it always is. Is it television? That has been the buzz for the past year but nothing has appeared. But is that because the in-house tech geniuses have come up short, or because the chief executive knows better than to talk casually? Nobody knows. But give the guy a break. It is fair to beat up Cook for failing to spot, until now, potential child-labour abuses in the supply chain. But it is too soon to conclude that Apple's innovation pipeline is broken, or that the firm has lost its appetite for taking development risks. That verdict will have to wait a year or two. In Wall Street terms, that's an eternity. But Cook would be foolish to try to run Apple to Wall Street's timetable. EU conundrum Does a possible referendum on membership of the EU represent a terrible threat to inward investment in the UK? Does half a decade in limbo await? No and no. OK, an attempted assassination of Ukip is not an uplifting way to launch the EU debate. But the notion that the \"uncertainty\" over membership is a game-changer for inward investment in the UK isn't persuasive. First, there is uncertainty wherever you look on the European battleground. Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank has dampened the flames of the eurozone crisis but only an extreme optimist would say he has extinguished them. The eurozone is travelling from monetary union to fiscal union. \"Ever-closer union\" means what it says. Any non-European investor will look at that journey and wonder if, when, at what cost, it will be completed. Will Germany really choose to lock itself into a federalised budget union with Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece? If it doesn't, the economics of a shiny new German car factory, say, are very different. Second, what if the UK did leave the EU? It remains a remote possibility but the terms of the divorce would be critical. Punitive two-way tariffs seem far-fetched since Germany has a trade surplus with Britain. Free-ish trade with Europe seems the way to bet, whatever happens. Third, David Cameron's gamble might succeed. From the point of view of business, a reformed EU and a better-functioning single market, with the UK and Germany as closer allies, would be a useful gain. Yes, the prime minister's political calculation could backfire. But Angela Merkel's polite reception to the speech was the important development. In any risk/reward assessment, the chance of helpful reforms to the single market have to be included. The real threat to inward investment in the UK is simple. Foreign investors are attracted by growth. At the moment, they will see a flat-on-its-back economy and a government short of ideas. A possible referendum, to be held after several more chapters of the unpredictable eurozone crisis, will seem like a sideshow. Tax transparency Well done, Justin King at Sainsbury's and Dalton Philips at Morrisons. They seem to be the FTSE 100 chief executives most keen to embrace the idea of companies giving a country-by-country account of where they pay tax. The rest of the bunch, to judge by the letters made public by Conservative MP Stephen McPartland, hate this definition of tax transparency. Ian Livingston at BT does not like the administrative cost, and Rupert Soames at Aggreko thinks giving country-by-country detail is \"unworkable\" for his company. At least the prime minister, campaigning against corporate tax avoidance, now knows what he is up against when he raises his plan at the G8. But surely he could start at home. There's nothing to the stop the UK from obliging companies operating here \u2013 say, those with a turnover of \u00a3500m-plus \u2013 to publish their UK tax details. The purpose? It's the pragmatic argument made by King: \"Rather than developing a new international accountancy standard, which will take a long time, I strongly believe that consumers are best placed to encourage companies to pay a fair amount of tax in the UK.\" That modest idea hardly seems likely to cause a dangerous outbreak of anti-business sentiment. There would be winners and losers \u2013 but that is the point. All change at WH Smith If \"resilient dynamism\", the bizarre motto of this year's Davos gathering, means anything its quality is probably best demonstrated by Kate Swann, a chief executive unlikely to be found clinking glasses at the Swiss jamboree. At WH Smith, which she will leave in June, Swann has played a bad hand brilliantly. The high street shops, as opposed to the ones on railway stations and in airports, have reported like-for-like sales declines every year during her nine-year tenure. A relentless focus on costs has saved the day and kept profits rolling. Good luck to her successor, Steve Clarke, he will need it. Squeezing more juice out of WH Smith looks a very tall order. Swann, one suspects, may have timed her exit perfectly. She wouldn't be the first in retail-land.",

      "body": "<p>A little sympathy for Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, is in order. Following Steve Jobs was never going to be easy, but he has hardly been helped by the hype and expectation piled on the company.</p> <p>Yes, Apple exploits the mood merrily when it has a new gizmo to flog. But Wall Street as showbiz on steroids can be an absurd spectacle. At Apple, the machine has been in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/24/apple-new-microsoft-steve-jobs-cool\" title=\"\">ridiculous overdrive</a> for the past year.</p> <p>The first sign was analysts' competition to be the first to predict a $1,000 share price. Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets in the US was the winner, garnering publicity by declaring \"Apple fever is spreading like a wildfire around the world\". Others piled in.</p> <p>Given the size of the company and its weight in various indices, not owning the shares suddenly became a career risk for the average US fund manager. Who would want to be the fool who stood alone against the iPhone 5?</p> <p>At $700 the stock was clearly priced for perfection. After a small slip \u2013 a wonky mapping app \u2013 the machine went into reverse. With whizzy technology stocks there is no neutral gear \u2013they are either on their way to the moon, or they are ex-growth companies that have run out of ideas.</p> <p>So <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2013/jan/24/apple-arm-imagination-laird-ftse?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">this week's numbers</a> were greeted as evidence of the latter \u2013 a confirmation Apple has peaked. And it is true that quarterly profits were flat year on year at $13.1bn (\u00a38bn) and that the annual outcome could be the first decline for a decade. Higher manufacturing costs are a fact of life and Samsung, which has put in a dent in Apple's profit margins, is a formidable competitor. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jan/24/apple-results-iphone-sales\" title=\"\">shares</a> fell another 12% to $450.</p> <p>But take a step back. After the ride on Wall Street's rollercoaster, Apple's shares stand almost exactly where they did a year ago. For a company in transition, that is hardly humiliation. The ex-growth label may sting but it is the rate of decline that matters. Middle age comes to everybody and handing out the winnings (Apple has $137bn in cash) in the form of dividends or buy-backs would be no disgrace.</p> <p>But can anybody really be confident Apple is ex-growth and the 48m iPhones sold in the past quarter represent a last hurrah? It is far too early to judge. The big event is the next product \u2013 it always is. Is it television? That has been the buzz for the past year but nothing has appeared. But is that because the in-house tech geniuses have come up short, or because the chief executive knows better than to talk casually? Nobody knows.</p> <p>But give the guy a break. It is fair to beat up Cook for failing to spot, until now, potential child-labour abuses in the supply chain. But it is too soon to conclude that Apple's innovation pipeline is broken, or that the firm has lost its appetite for taking development risks. That verdict will have to wait a year or two. In Wall Street terms, that's an eternity. But Cook would be foolish to try to run Apple to Wall Street's timetable.</p> <h2><strong>EU conundrum</strong></h2> <p>Does a possible referendum on membership of the EU represent a terrible threat to inward investment in the UK? Does half a decade in limbo await? No and no.</p> <p>OK, an attempted assassination of Ukip is not an uplifting way to launch the EU debate. But the notion that the \"uncertainty\" over membership is a game-changer for inward investment in the UK isn't persuasive.</p> <p>First, there is uncertainty wherever you look on the European battleground. Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank has dampened the flames of the eurozone crisis but only an extreme optimist would say he has extinguished them.</p> <p>The eurozone is travelling from monetary union to fiscal union. \"Ever-closer union\" means what it says. Any non-European investor will look at that journey and wonder if, when, at what cost, it will be completed. Will Germany really choose to lock itself into a federalised budget union with Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece? If it doesn't, the economics of a shiny new German car factory, say, are very different.</p> <p>Second, what if the UK did leave the EU? It remains a remote possibility but the terms of the divorce would be critical. Punitive two-way tariffs seem far-fetched since Germany has a trade surplus with Britain. Free-ish trade with Europe seems the way to bet, whatever happens.</p> <p>Third, David Cameron's gamble might succeed. From the point of view of business, a reformed EU and a better-functioning single market, with the UK and Germany as closer allies, would be a useful gain.</p> <p>Yes, the prime minister's political calculation could backfire. But Angela Merkel's polite reception to the speech was the important development. In any risk/reward assessment, the chance of helpful reforms to the single market have to be included.</p> <p>The real threat to inward investment in the UK is simple. Foreign investors are attracted by growth. At the moment, they will see a flat-on-its-back economy and a government short of ideas. A possible referendum, to be held after several more chapters of the unpredictable eurozone crisis, will seem like a sideshow.</p> <h2><strong>Tax transparency</strong></h2> <p>Well done, Justin King at Sainsbury's and Dalton Philips at Morrisons. They seem to be the FTSE 100 chief executives most keen to embrace the idea of companies giving a country-by-country account of where they pay tax. The rest of the bunch, to judge by the letters made public by Conservative MP Stephen McPartland, hate this definition of tax transparency. Ian Livingston at BT does not like the administrative cost, and Rupert Soames at Aggreko thinks giving country-by-country detail is \"unworkable\" for his company.</p> <p>At least the prime minister, campaigning against corporate tax avoidance, now knows what he is up against when he raises his plan at the G8. But surely he could start at home. There's nothing to the stop the UK from obliging companies operating here \u2013 say, those with a turnover of \u00a3500m-plus \u2013 to publish their UK tax details.</p> <p>The purpose? It's the pragmatic argument made by King: \"Rather than developing a new international accountancy standard, which will take a long time, I strongly believe that consumers are best placed to encourage companies to pay a fair amount of tax in the UK.\" That modest idea hardly seems likely to cause a dangerous outbreak of anti-business sentiment. There would be winners and losers \u2013 but that is the point.</p> <h2><strong>All change at WH Smith</strong></h2> <p>If \"resilient dynamism\", the bizarre motto of this year's Davos gathering, means anything its quality is probably best demonstrated by Kate Swann, a chief executive unlikely to be found clinking glasses at the Swiss jamboree.

      "bodyText": "Tesco has apologised and launched an urgent investigation after one of its stores sold burgers that were meant to have been withdrawn last week amid the horsemeat contamination scare. The supermarket acted after a BBC reporter managed to buy a packet of Tesco-brand \"free from\" frozen quarter-pounders when a member of staff overrode an alert message on a till at a store in Cowley, Oxford. The BBC had been tipped off by a customer that lines Tesco had ordered to be removed as a precaution were still on sale. Meanwhile, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said on Friday that a new round of samples taken from the British food plant implicated in the scare had tested negative for both horse and pork DNA. Seven samples were taken from the Dalepak Hambleton plant near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, after Irish safety watchdogs who carried out tests late last year revealed last week that some products made there were tainted. The follow-up checks, made by trading standards officers on behalf of the FSA, concentrated on the same lines at the plant, which has been continuing production. Investigations are ongoing after an estimated 10m beefburgers were taken off the shelves when some lines from Tesco, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland were discovered to have contained traces of horsemeat. Supermarkets not implicated in the Irish tests at Dalepak and two Irish plants also withdrew products from sale as a precaution. Waitrose, which took unaffected products off the shelves on Monday, later than some competitors, now plans to refill its shelves as soon as possible, after the British Retailers Consortium restored its accreditation to Dalepak following nearly a week's suspension. Other tests are continuing in Ireland. One of the Irish plants, Silvercrest, in County Monaghan, which is used by Tesco and other companies operating in the UK and, like Dalepack, is owned by ABP Foods, halted production last week.

      "bodyText": "Britain is now halfway to an unprecedented triple-dip recession due to a stalled recovery in a manufacturing sector that was supposed to kickstart sustained growth in the aftermath of the credit crunch. Industrial production was growing strongly in 2011 but the government's aim of rebalancing the economy away from financial services and towards the manufacturing belt of the Midlands and north England appears to have foundered. A fall in manufacturing output in the last three months of 2012 countered a small rise in construction between October and December to leave a 0.3% contraction in GDP, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The economy achieved zero growth for the year as a whole as the services sector, which accounts for three-quarters of national output compared with manufacturing's 10%, also struggled to grow. The decline was blamed on the recession in the eurozone, which has hit exports; bad weather, which hit shops and farmers; and a temporary drop in oil and gas output in the North Sea. However, Chris Williamson, chief economist at the financial data provider Markit, said the figures revealed a \"broad-based weakness throughout the economy\" and threatened Britain's AAA credit rating, viewed by George Osborne as an emblem of Britain's economic credibility. \"Today's numbers have greatly increased the risk of a new recession and a downgrading of the UK's AAA credit rating. As such, the data pile ever more pressure on the chancellor to seek ways to revive the economy in the March budget,\" Williamson said. The chancellor, who faces accusations across the political spectrum of sitting on his hands as growth founders, said he would not run away from the problems facing the UK economy. \"We have a reminder today that Britain faces a very difficult economic situation. A reminder that last year was particularly difficult, that we face problems at home because of the debts built up over many years and problems abroad with the eurozone, where we export most of our products, in recession,\" he said. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, called on Osborne to introduce policies that would \"kickstart our flatlining economy\".

A triple-dip recession, or the third prolonged downturn since the credit crunch began, will occur if the economy contracts again in the first quarter of 2013. The economy remains 3.5% below its peak in 2007 and is not expected to return to its previous high for at least another two years, making it the longest recovery in 100 years. \"We are now midway through the coalition's term of office and its economic strategy has been a complete disaster.

So I'll knock this on the head, and go and join in! Thanks for reading. Goodnight! GW We've just published a full news story on one of the big issues of Davos today - gender equality. Here's a flavour: Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, has launched a fierce attack on the gender stereotypes that hold back women at work at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Sandberg, who is publishing a book called Lean In on women in the workplace in March, singled out T-shirts sold in the US, with the boys' version emblazoned with the words \"Smart Like Daddy\", while the girls' version says \"Pretty like Mommy\". \"I would love to say that was 1951, but it was last year,\" she said. \"As a woman becomes more successful, she is less liked, and as a man becomes more successful, he is more liked, and that starts with those T-shirts.\" She blasted managers who unconsciously reflect stereotypes when they judge women's performance, saying: \"She's great at her job but she's just not as well liked by her peers,\" or: \"She's a bit aggressive.\" Here's the full story Fleur Pellerin, France's junior minister for SMEs and the Digital Economy, has offered support for David Cameron's tax avoidance plans. She told a Davos press conference that she hopes to attract more digital companies to France by offering tax breaks. She denied, though, that this is a French plot to attract companies from Britain, saying that France has also suffered from companies playing the system. My conviction is that in the EU we should stick together to fight tax avoidance. We have seen problems, as Britain has, with firms who put systems in place so that they pay a very low tax on their global revenues. It's particularly hard to make sure digital companies are paying revenues in the right territories, Pellerin pointed out, adding: I don't want to roll out the tapis rouge to firms who don't want to work in the UK. On the contrary we must stick together and find ways to improve the tax environment in Europe. GW Over at the Belvedere Hotel, artists have been taking suggestions about 'what makes innovation' and drawing then along a long corridor. I snapped a few: Investors have shrugged off the UK's poor GDP figures and concentrated on better than expected German business confidence figures. That seems to be the message as European markets continued their recent rally, with Germany leading the way. Traders pointed to thin share dealing volumes in the UK, suggesting the day's increase was not built on anything substantial. Still, a rally is a rally: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 19.54 points or 0.31% at 6284.45 \u2022 Germany's Dax has jumped 1.42% \u2022 France's Cac has closed up 0.69% \u2022 Spain's Ibex is up 0.68% \u2022 In Athens, the market added 2.74% \u2022 But Italy missed out, with the FTSE MIB edging 0.17% lower \u2022 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.36% Bailing out the US financial system looked like \"giving aid to the arsonists\", outgoing treasury secretary Tim Geithner said on Friday, his last day in the job, writes Dominic Rushe. In a series of interviews to mark his departure, Geithner discussed his central role in the financial crisis. He told the New Republic he understood public anger that no senior bankers have been charged following the biggest financial crisis in living memory. \"My own view was that it was going to be very hard, if not impossible to design a financial rescue that was going to be effective in protecting all the innocent victims hit by the crisis and still satisfy the completely understandable public desire for justice and accountability. Those things were in direct and tragic tension, never resolvable at that time,\" he said. Full story here. Wanna buy a new motor? In Spain an incentive scheme to boost car sales was due to run out this month, but prime minister Mariano Rajoy has just announced it will be extended. Speaking in Chile, where he is attending a meeting of European and Latin American leaders, Rajoy said his government would spend \u20ac150m euros on the extension. The deal involves a \u20ac2000 discount when people trade in their existing car - must be 12 years old or more - to buy a new vehicle. The plan helped ease the fall in car sales last year due to the economic downturn. US economist Barry Eichengreen has warned the eurozone debt crisis could erupt again this year unless European leaders move more swiftly to solve their problems. In an interview with Associated Press at Davos, he said: Nothing has been resolved in the eurozone, where markets have swung from undue pessimism to undue optimism. They said all the right things last year ... and they've been backtracking ever since. AP said Eichengreen warned the crisis \"is going to heat up again in 2013\": He urged eurozone leaders follow up on its proposals to steady its banking system and keep failed banks from adding to government debt through expensive bailouts. Shareholders in Italy's Monte dei Paschi have approved two capital increases of up to \u20ac6.5bn, to be carried out if needed over the next five years. This would allow the bank to issue shares to the Treasury if it cannot repay interest on bonds it is selling to the government as part of its \u20ac3.9bn state bailout, or reimburse the loans. The bank also said it had approved the sale of a number of non-strategic stakes to boost its capital, reports Reuters. Spirits are flagging at Davos, as the relentless grind of meetings, speeches, security scans and parties takes its toll on the global elite. One distinguished UK visitor just remarked to us that \"I'm starting to think about heading home tomorrow\". Not everyone is tired, though -- Christine Lagarde just marched past vigorously with a small posse in tow. GW In the US, new home sales fell in December but analysts remained fairly positive on the state of the market. Commerce Department figures showed single-family home sales dropped 7.3% last month to 369,000, below expectations of 385,000. But the median price rose from $245,000 to $248,000. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Despite the lower-than-expected month on month reading, the average of the fourth quarter remains above the previous three months (377,000 from 370,000), a sign that housing activity has gained some momentum. December housing data were mixed but we still see a pick-up in activity throughout the year. The number of homes for sale increased for the second straight month. This is relatively good news for home sales in the next few months as the lack of supply has been a key problem in the recent past. Both the median and average prices indices rose in December, with the annual pace of growth at around 14%-15%, a sign that the worst for the US housing market is behind us. Boris Johnson has told business leaders at Davos it is time to stop talking about austerity and concentrate on measures to boost confidence and spending. The London mayor was speaking at a business leaders lunch organised by the CBI. Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Boris Johnson called on the government to drop its \u201chair-shirt, Stafford Cripps\u201d agenda as he outlined a seven-point growth plan for London involving building thousands of new homes and investment in major infrastructure projects. Speaking at a British business lunch in Davos shortly after the release of figures showing the economy was again contracting, the mayor of London said it was time to \u201cjunk the rhetoric of austerity\u201d and instead take steps to boost confidence and spending. Johnson was critical of some of the gloomy talk coming out of the Bank of England and said that the language of cuts was \u201cnot terribly useful in this sort of climate\u201d. He urged counter-cyclical measures that would work against the trends depressing activity. \u201cThere is huge potential in the UK. It is important we have the spirit of confidence. Some of the mutterings from Threadneedle Street are not the stuff to give the troops.\u201d He added: \u201cWe need investment in housing and transport, things that make a big difference.\u201d More online shortly. Incidentally, there is a good tale which supposedly explains why Boris was at the CBI lunch at all. The Telegraph's Jeremy Warner writes: Boris Johnson is said to be the most sought after public speaker in Britain, so how did Sir Roger Carr, president of the CBI, persuade him to speak at the British chief executives lunch in Davos? By fixing his boiler, that's how. No really. At the same event last year, Boris took a call from his wife, who complained vigorously that the central heating had gone down. Quick as a flash, Sir Roger had it instantly fixed, wearing his other hat as chairman of Centrica, owner of British Gas. The quid pro quo? That Boris agreed to speak at this year's event. Ah the deals that get done in Davos. There are some distressing statistics out of Greece today, which show Greek households suffered a 10.6% drop in disposable income on in the third quarter of 2012, compared with the same period in 2011. Reuters reports: Athens has slashed public sector pay and pensions and raised taxes to shore up public finances under measures prescribed by its euro zone partners and theInternational Monetary Fund to keep bailout aid flowing to the country. According to ELSTAT, the fall in disposable income was mainly due to an 11.3 percent drop in workers' pay, a 10.2 percent fall in social benefits and a 17.7 percent rise in taxes on income and wealth. The resulting squeeze on household budgets led to a 6.1 percent fall in consumption to 35.9 billion euros ($48.3 billion) in the third quarter, deepening the economic slump which is now in its sixth consecutive year. Back to Davos and comments from Tim Berners-Lee \u2013 the man who invented the world wide web \u2013 about the shackles stifling the free flow of online data. Berners Lee criticised the closed nature of social networks. He said people used to have full control over their own information because it was all stored on their own computer in front of them. Now, people store data with online services that deprive them of that control. They put their photographs into Flickr. The simplest thing in world, you'd think, would be to share these photos with Facebook friends and LindedIn colleagues. But you can't do that, because these social networks are a silo. There's a frustration that I've told it all my data, but I as a user don't have access to that. He also called for governments and other institutions to share more data online, such as statistics on outcomes from hospital stays, which could improve accountability, and let organisations learn what works or not. JM I just caught the end of King Abdullah II of Jordan's session in the Davos conference hall, where he was warning that the global community has until the end of 2016 to agree a two-state solution for Israel. He argued that President Obama's second term is a great opportunity, but one that must not be wasted. I believe that if it is not a two state solution, it will be a one-state solution, and without democracy you are looking at apartheid. That is why many Israelis also believe that a two-state solution is the answer. GW One of Ireland's leading economists has predicted David Cameron's proposed referendum can only mean the UK's exit from the EU, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin. At the British Irish Chamber of Commerce meeting in Dublin, David McWilliams said there is a \"very high chance\" of Britain leaving the EU. The economist, newspaper columnist and television presenter who was one of the few to issue warning signs about the Celtic Tiger's imminent collapse, said if he was a betting man he would bet the UK, particularly the population of England, will opt for exit. \"I don't think the European Union will give the Conservatives what they want and the Conservatives are in a difficult position because they come back not with what they wanted, and their party splits. In those circumstances the British people, or rather the English people who are the majority, vote to leave the European Union. I can see that as a very, very obvious outcome over the next four to five years,\" McWilliams said. More on Italy's Monte dei Paschi, the world's oldest bank which is under renewed financial pressure thanks to some loss-making derivatives deals. Italian finance minister Vittorio Grilli will address a parliamentary committee on the bank on 29 January, Reuters is reporting. NF Back to Davos, where UK chancellor George Osborne has been doing the rounds of the ad-hoc TV studios to defend his record, after figures showed the British economy shrank by 0.3% in the last three months of the year. Osborne said to the BBC: We do have these huge problems in our economy, we are dealling with the debts, we are dealing with a very unbalanced economy, an economy that was not exporting enough to China and India. We've had the problems last year of a real financial risk that the Euroepan banking system could collapse. That had a huge impact on sentiment. He then made the rather remakable statement: I'm making no excuses. He said the UK has been spending too much on welfare and not enough on infrastructure and that is changing under this government. I think the welfare system was too expensive. It had the wrong incentives in it, we've had to change that. We've reinvested [those savings] in roads and railways and so on. He said the UK's deficit reduction plan has credibility, as shown by the UK's very low interest rates, but also flexibility to deal with the ups and downs of the world economy. But he once again rejected advice from the IMF's chief economist that Britain should ease off on austerity. I think we've got the right deficit reduction plan. The IMF say very clearly this week that countries with high deficits need steady and sustainable deficit reduction plans. I would say the test is this, do people look at britain and say this is a good place to invest... I think they do. And there's plenty of chat about the pizza George Osborne enjoyed loudly with David Cameron and Boris Johnson last night, which Labour has dubbed 'pepperonigate'. (Who needs the Thick of It when reality is such a farce). As Channel 4's economics editor notes, they should have gone for a fondue. Back in the eurozone, the markets have reacted sharply to the news that European banks have paid back \u20ac137bn of the cheap money lent out by the ECB in the depths of the crisis. The euro rallied on the news to hit an 11-month high. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities says: If you spin this optimistically \u2013 and it is spinning because there's lots of things we don't know yet \u2013 all you can do is construct a rationale that goes... The euro area banks don't need as much assistance. They are able to pay back the money they've borrowed. To some extent \u2013 given the Bank of Japan and the US Fed are still injecting money into their economies \u2013 that implies the ECB in a better position to raise rates earlier than others. But Ostwald reiterates the fact that is all theory. We know the array of eurozone risks, while they may be in abeyance at the moment, can all spring back to life. Meanwhile, the rate at which banks lend to one another on a short-term basis jumped by between 0.05% and 0.1%. JM Over to Dublin, where our correspondent Henry McDonald reports that the Scottish Nationalists see David Cameron's proposal for a referendum on Europe as strengthening Scotland's case of independence. He writes: David Cameron and Tory England's difficulties with the EU are Scotland's opportunity, the Scottish Nationalist Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said today. Sturgeon said Cameron's proposal for a referendum on Europe would in fact \"strengthen the case for independence.\" Speaking in Dublin's Aviva Stadium this morning at the first meeting of the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce, Scotland's Deputy First Minister said: \"People in Scotland are not without their frustrations about the European Union. We do think Europe needs to be reformed, we don't want unecessary regulation coming from Europe but people pragmatically believe that being in Europe with influence in Europe is very strongly in our national interest. \"So what we want to see is Scotland in Europe but also independent in Europe because that is the status that best allows us to assert and protect our national interest. And I think that case has been strenghtened as a result of David Cameoron's speech this week,\" she told The Guardian. Sturgeon repeated the SNP's promise that they wanted independence in Europe but not inside the Euro and stay part of the Sterling currency system. \"Sweden are living proof that countries cannot be forced into the Euro beyond their will. We've got no intention of Scotland being in the Euro not for the foreseeable future,\" the Deputy First Minister said. She also pointed out during her speech that membership of the EU has created and safeguarded around 64,000 jobs for Scotland in the last decade. An organisation protesting against the WEF have blown up the postbox of the boss of commodity trader Glencore, and attacked a branch of Credit Suisse in Zurich. Reuters reports: Police confirmed on Friday that protestors carried out individual attacks on a Credit Suisse branch in [Zurich] and a postbos in the alkeside subub of Rueschlikon in the early hours of Thursday morning. Credit Suisse confirmed that a security sindow of its branch had been shattered. Police said the damage amounted to several thousand francs. A spokesperson for Glencore confirmed that an incident took place on the property of CEO Ivan Glasenberg. No-one was injured in either attack. A unnamed organisation claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they had targeted Credit Suisse and Glasenberg due to their connections to the WEF. First it was pizza, now David Cameron is in hot water about beer. A Swedish newspaper reports that the British PM asked for beer glasses to be cleared from a table before a photo-op with Sweden's PM. The pictures are pretty funny ... see them here. This Google translation suggests that the beers had been laid out in preparation for the meeting with Fredrik Reinfeldt, but had to be whisked away once staff realised that the Expressen newspaper would be there. Could be worse for Cameron - there's plenty of champagne glasses around the place... GW Policing doesn't get much colder than this. You'd think they'd provide gloves to the men with big guns outside the WEF congress centre. Another green initiative was just announced -- with Nissan partnering with one of Davos's \"young global leaders\" (it's true!), Otto Von Troschke, to put 20 zero-emissions taxis on the streets of Zurich. Von Troschke wants to put the vehicles on a decent number of the world's main 'hub' cities - starting with 15 in the next two years. Renault-Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn backed the plan, saying: It is great to see young people using new technologies to change the world. Ghosn was then chased out of the press conference room by a hungry gaggle of hacks, demanding his views on the yen. Ghosn said he \"salutes\" recent moves by the Japanese government to devalue its currency (it hit a two-and-a-half year low against the US dollar of 90.69 overnight), but reckons there's more to do. 90 (yen to the dollar) is better than 75, but my view is that 100 is neutral. Another volley in the currency wars... GW Back in the UK, we should look at the impact of the ECB's announcement on the repayment of cheap money, issued under the LTRO. Economists say the announcement is a strong vote of confidence in the euro. Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank writes: Amid fading tensions in the euro crisis, the ECB is taking back some of the extra liquidity it injected into the banking system a year ago. This is a stark contrast to other central banks such as the US Fed, the BoE and the BoJ who are still blowing up their balance sheets. No wonder that the Euro exchange rate is going up. We see the voluntary return of excess liquidity to the ECB as a strong vote of confidence in the euro. He says banks are repaying the cheap loans because their normal channels of funding have come back to life. Most of the funds will be returned because banks no longer need them. Private funding markets have reopened since the ECB announced its potentially unlimited bond purchases last August. The large repayment shows how the ECB\u2019s intervention is successfully healing the Eurozone financial system. JM It seems IMF chief Christine Lagarde is tweeting from the Davos event on women in economics. She says: While the Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott has been catching up with Pascal Lamy, the head of the World Trade Organisation. He writes: A deal to cut the red tape that clogs up global trade would provide a $1tn boost to the global economy if it can be agreed by the end of the year, the head of the World Trade Organisation said today. Speaking in Davos, the WTO\u2019s director-general Pascal Lamy said there was a good chance that the most important part of the stalled Doha trade negotiations would be concluded when trade ministers meet in Bali in December. Lamy said there was no chance of an immediate conclusion to the whole round, a complex set of negotiations that includes 20 separate aspects of trade including manufacturing tariffs, agriculture, services and the rules governing the import and export of goods and services. Talks have been underway since late 2001 and despite hopes that the re-election of Barack Obama for a second term would smooth the way to a comprehensive deal, Lamy was downbeat about the prospects. \"There will be no agreement on Doha by the end of this year. We have known that for some time. \"What will happen is that a number of bits of the agenda will be concluded selectively one by one starting with trade facilitation. Removing barriers to trade will deliver half to two thirds of the benefits of the round. World trade is worth $22tn dollars and the cost of moving trade is $2tn. Cutting red tape in half could stimulate the world economy by $1tn.\u201d More online shortly. LE Back to the panel on \"women in economic decision-making\" over in Davos. Heather Stewart, the Observer's economics editor reports: At a panel on \"women in economic decision-making\" - with just one man, very rare for Davos - Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg spoke out strongly about the gender stereotypes that hold women back. \"There were T shirts on sale, saying 'Smart Like Daddy', or 'Pretty like Mommy'; I'd like to say that was 1951, but it was last year, in America.\" She said that as women become more successful, they're less liked, while the opposite is true of men - \"and that starts with those T shirts\". She said most women have two jobs - their day-job, plus caring for their children - while men just have one. HS The European Cental Bank has announced that 278 banks plan to repay \u20ac137.2bn of the money it lent at super cheap rates at the height of the crisis. The early repayments are due to take place on 30 January, and show how the banks become less reliant on the ECB as the eurozone crisis eases. In all 523 banks borrowed \u20ac490m in the first handout at the end of December 2011 as part of the LTRO (long term refinancing operation). The \u20ac137.2bn compares with market estimates of between \u20ac50bn and \u20ac300bn. The news has reinforced earlier market movements, with the euro moving higher and German bund futures lower. Banks shares have also risen. NF Our colleague Heather Stewart is at the \"Women in economic decision making\" session at Davos with Drew Gilpin Faust, Kevin Kelly, Christine Lagarde, Lubna S Olayan, Viviane Reding and Sheryl Sandberg. Just caught the second half of Marissa Mayer's one-to-one interview about the future. Yahoo's CEO credited Apple with igniting people's passion for design, enthused about the potential of mobile, and also admitted that Yahoo had not spent enough on its key products in the past (she joined from Google last year): GW Portugal may well need a new bailout once the current programme ends despite this week's successful return to the bond market, according to Fitch. The ratings agency said Wednesday's sale of \u20ac2.5bn worth of five-year bonds was positive for the country's credit profit, but significant economic and political risks remained. Fitch said: We believe it remains challenging for Portugal to regain full market access because of large funding needs and the continuing high risk premium at the long end of the yield curve, which implies an unsustainably high cost of funding. Our base case remains that Portugal will not gain full market access by the time the IMF-EU programme expires and, therefore, additional funding support and a new programme will be needed. The Portuguese economy still faces several challenges. The weak economic outlook is complicating the government's deficit reduction plan and Portugal is only part way through its adjustment. A large effort is still required to achieve sustainable public finances in the medium term. To achieve this would involve additional fiscal measures, including cuts to government spending. Cross-party commitment to the programme is therefore likely to be tested further. Moreover, institutional constraints could limit the government's room for manoeuvre. Political risk remains significant. NF Draghi's final answer was that all the recent pain and turmoil has been \"emphatically\" worth it, and that the eurozone economy still has many strengths. The long-term challenge, he says, is to rebuild the recent erosion of national sovereignty by rebuilding it at a higher level: Tony Connelly of RTE got the quotes down better than I: Mario Draghi's views on fiscal consolidation could be summed up as \"do it quickly, do it hard, and wind it back when you can\". John Lipsky said recent IMF research bears it out. GW Mario Draghi just gave a great answer to a question on what should be the appropriate pace of fiscal consolidation in the eurozone? He said he didn't like considering it as a question of austerity versus growth. Fiscal consolidation is unavoidable. There cannot be any sustainable growth with endless collection of debt. But we must admit that fiscal consolidation is contractionary in the short term. The question is not growth vs austerity. The question is how we mitigate the short-term affect of consolidation. Draghi makes three proposals: 1) Do the consolidation in a way that stimulates exports so you dampen the consolidation through more exports and job creation. 2) Many governments usually implement these plans under a sense of \"stress and urgency\", the stress of markets and with interest rates moving sharply upwards. Thus, they raise taxes and cut spending. That \"can be justified\" at the time, Draghi says, but: When the panic subsides, you would want to see \"curbs to cuts in spending\", reductions in tax rises, and increased investment in infrastructure. 3) Hesitation in undertaking fiscal consolidation doesn't pay. It's actually very very costly, says Draghi. Front loading is very important to reap the benefits of stability, and lower rates on borrowing. GW Mario Draghi has, in the most charming way, warned his critics that he won't change his approach to running the European Central Bank. He explains that he has proved that he can \"steer\" financial markets without breaching his official mandate of fighting inflation: Given our mandate of ensuring price stability, we have given plenty of evidence that we can do this within the existing framework 2013 must be a year of implementation, Draghi says, with governments cracking on with the measures they have agreed. The OMT bond-buying programme could still be triggered, he reckons (no suggestion which country might apply for help, though). Have we reached a turning point, Lipsky asks Draghi? Draghi says the job of repairing the \"fragmentation\" that exists within Europe. The ECB must comply with its basic mandate of maintaining price stability But we must go back to a fully integrated financial and capital markets. Financial markets, he says are enjoying a new sense of relative tranquility -- we are returning to a new normality, he argues. But - and here's the crucial point - it's not fed into the real economy yet. That recovery must wait until the second half of this year. GW Draghi tells the audience to remember how weak the eurozone economy was a year ago. Now, he says, current accounts are turning to surplus, deficits are getting better. There has also been \"substantial progress at eurozone governance levels\", Draghi says. And he also points to the ECB's own measures - its Long Term Refinancing Operations which averted a credit crunch, and the OMT programme (the pledge to buy unlimited quantities of government bonds if a country agrees to reforms). GW Mario Draghi starts by talking about the last year... He says 2012 was, to say the least, an interesting year. It is the year of the relaunching of the euro. GW UK GDP fell 0.3% quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2012, more than the consensus forecast of a 0.1% decline. Year on year the figure was unchanged. Sterling's immediate reaction is to dip further. All the details and reaction on our live GDP blog. NF The euro has hit a new 11 month high of $1.3434 against the dollar and 85.025p against the pound, while Bund futures have dipped following the better than expected German IFO reading. Think tank IFO's economist Klaus Wohlrabe said he sees economic growth of 0.2% in the first quarter and did not expect a recession in Germany. The country's firms are starting to feel the impact of the eurozone crisis easing, he said, while exporters are optimistic and have no fear of a currency war, something that has been very much in the spotlight in recent days. NF Back in Blighty, the head of Goldman Sachs has criticised prime minister David Cameron's pledge yesterday to reform the tax system to cut down on avoidance. Lloyd Blankfein told the Today programme: If all of a sudden, in addition to the rules that generate certainty for people, the signposts become so amorphous and so loose and so subject to second-guessing, you're making everything uncertain and it's very hard to organise your affairs in a sensible way. I'm not saying that you are exculpated from any pressure merely because you meet the rule of law - we've never said that, we don't live that life. But I would say 'Are you going to hold people up to public opprobrium because a house they could have sold in January instead they sell in May because there was a profit to be made on that house because the selling price was higher than the purchase price?'. If you do that, you are going to criminalise every right-thinking person who organises his or her affairs in a sensible way. Hmmm... GW UK GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2012 are due shortly, and economists are uncertain whether they will show a slight increase or a decline, pushing the country closer to a triple dip recession. We are covering all the GDP developments at a separate live blog here, while the action from Davos, the eurozone et al will remain here. NF More signs of recovery in Germany, with the IFO business confidence index coming in higher than expectations. The index reached 104.2 in January, compared with a Reuters consensus forecast of 103 and a figure of 102.4 the previous month. This is the highest reading since June 2012. The market had been hoping for a good number following better than expected manufacturing and services data this week and a sharp rise in the ZEW confidence index. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: While the ZEW is a barometer of investor and market sentiment the IFO is a much more accurate measure, given that it is a gauge of how German businesses feel about any changes in the economic outlook, with respect to hiring, investment and spending. The IFO index is based on a survey of around 7,000 firms. NF Two interesting issues were discussed at the press conference with Viviane Reding - women in the boardroom, and data protection. On gender, Commissioner Reding declared that her threat to bring in new laws on gender equality had brought European countries into line. Women now make up 15.8% of company boards, up from 13.7% a year ago. Since the moment that I threatened that if there was no progress then I would put up legislation, there has been real progress. Sometimes it needs a little push. This issue will also be discussed in more detail at a full session at 11am CET (see earlier agenda) She also hopes to crack on with her push for a single data protection law across all 27 countries of the EU, with tough sanctions for deliberate offenders. In the modern Internet word, more and more people are losing trust in the way their data is handled. Reding hopes for political agreement by the end of the Irish presidency, in June 2013. GW The Bank of Italy has said a judicial investigation is underway into Monte dei Pashi, the world's oldest bank, which received a bailout but this week reported a possible loss of \u20ac720m on derivatives trades. Prime minister Mario Monti has already said he could bring the issue to parliament, and in a radio broadcast he called for a full investigation but said his government was not responsible for the crisis. The bank's shares have been suspended, with its chairman saying the situation was under control. According to Reuters he told a shareholder meeting: I'd like to remind you that we have 31,000 employees, we are a great company with six million customers. The Bank of Italy said there was no immediate risk to the stability of Monte Pashi, and it was taking no immediate action of its own. NF Christine Harper of Bloomberg has dislodged Nouriel Roubini from the list of most active Davos tweeters. He's out of the medals! But for how long?... GW Just been told that European Commissioner for Justice Viviane Reding is giving a press conference in a few minutes (deep in the bowels of the Davos bunker), so will pop along... GW Back to the ECB announcement, the currencies and bonds editor at Dow Jones provides a helpful explanation of all the research flying around on the subject. JM If you were reading last night's blog, you'll know that there was a rumour that David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson were going for a quiet dinner. Well, according to Greenpeace's Ben Stewart, it happened - but it wasn't very quiet. He says he was sitting in a pizza restaurant when the trio of top Tories dropped in. Boris, it seems, was the butt of a few jokes too: No reports of bread rolls being thrown. GW Taking a closer look at the European Central Bank's announcement later today. Essentially the ECB will be telling the markets how much of the money it lent out to banks at super cheap rates at the height of the crisis is being repaid early. This should give an indicator of the improving economic health in the eurozone, as banks become less reliant on the central bank. Today, the ECB will say how much of the \u20ac490m first tranche of the long-term will be returned immediately by the 523 banks that took part in the first of its handouts at the end of December 2011. Market estimates for how much will be repaid range from as little as \u20ac50bn to \u20ac300bn. In deciding whether to repay early, banks must weigh up the desire to show shareholders, regulators and rating agencies that they are weaning themselves off central bank life support, against the fact that borrowing money elsewhere is generally much more expensive. Traders are watching the figures closely as all the money pumped into the system by the ECB have kept bank-to-bank lending rates at record low levels. If that \"excess liquidity\" is removed from the system, those lending rates could move back to more normal levels. We shall see ... JM Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott and Observer economics editor Heather Stewart are also with me in Davos, so we'll be using our initials to show who wrote which posts.

After yesterday's roster of politicians, today's agenda is laden with technology heavyweights. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Marissa Mayer and Sheryl Sandberg have all braved the chill of this little Swiss ski resort to mingle with world leaders, economists, NGO heads and other big hitters. The state of the financial system will also be in focus, with ECB president Mario Draghi giving the big speech this morning, and a debate on the eurozone scheduled for tonight. The situation in the Middle East is also a big topic in Davos, especially after UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon delivered a no-holds-barred warning about the desperate situation in Syria and the escalating crisis in Mali. So the King of Jordan's speech this afternoon will also be keenly watched. We'll post a full agenda shortly. GW",

    "webTitle": "EasyJet heads closer to FTSE 100 after positive update, as leading index continues rally", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "From a new row with its major shareholder to a share surge which puts it on course for a place in the FTSE 100, it has been an eventful week for easyJet. It started badly with news that founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou had disposed of some of his shares and threatened to sell more if the budget airline continued with plans to enlarge its fleet. But a positive update on Thursday, with a jump in revenues from higher margin business passengers, pushed these problems to one side. EasyJet jumped 46.5p to 945p on Friday, valuing it at more than \u00a33.7bn. This makes it the largest company in the FTSE 250 and puts it in with a good chance of joining the leading index at the next review in early March. A number of analysts raised their recommendations after the airline's update, with UBS moving from neutral to buy and Deutsche Bank lifting its price target from 940p to \u00a310.40. Gerald Khoo at Espirito Santo said: We have raised our estimates by 20% following easyJet's better than expected first quarter update. Visibility on summer bookings remains limited (only 15% booked at present), and there remains the risk that industry capacity discipline may ease in the summer or operational disruption worsen. However, easyJet's own initiatives appear to be delivering and some of these will not gather momentum until next year (allocated seating, global distribution system links), giving us confidence in ongoing revenue and margin improvements. We reiterate our buy recommendation and increase our fair value to \u00a310.25 from 810p. The airline's positive results also helped lift International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, by 4.6p to 223p. With growing hopes that IAG can avoid a prolonged dispute with Iberia's unions, JP Morgan moved from neutral to overweight on the company, saying: We see the decision by Iberia unions to negotiate the details of the restructuring plan with no change to its overall targets as lowering the short-term risk of turbulence surrounding its implementation. We believe IAG shares will outperform once Iberia reaches agreement with unions (or implements unilateral cuts), and see the recent underperformance as a good entry point for investors. Overall, leading shares continued their rally, with the FTSE 100 at near five year highs. The leading index closed at 6284.45, up 19.54 points on the day and 130 points on the week. This is the highest level since 19 May 2008. Investors shook off the weak UK economy, as evidenced by disappointing fourth quarter GDP figures, and news that the International Monetary Fund had cut its global growth forecasts as the great and the good gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Sentiment was helped by the US passing a bill to suspend its debt ceiling until May, giving more time for to resolve the contentious negotiations on the US budget. European markets were lifted by strong German business confidence figures. Tui Travel was the biggest riser in the leading index, up 11.1p at 293.1p. Earlier in the week it came under pressure as its German parent Tui AG decided against making an offer for the rest of the business it does not own. Analysts at its joint broker Barclays started coverage of the company again after the talks collapsed, saying: We reinstate both our overweight recommendation and 320p price target on Tui Travel. Our investment thesis remains intact, and is not predicated on any corporate activity. We believe that the company should benefit in 2013 from a tailwind of low cost inflation, and anecdotal evidence from peers suggests that trading is strong. The company reports first quarter numbers on 7 February, which we expect to show continued robust underlying growth. Citigroup was neutral on Tui Travel but in a note on the sector it raised its target price on the business from 175p to 300p. The bank said: We are unsure how much further Tui Travel's differentiation strategy can take it but raise our target price to reflect the group's strong operating performance. We see upside from any potential merger with Tui AG, without it the shares look fully valued. But mining and commodity shares missed out on the gains. Coal exports from Australia have been disrupted by rain and flooding following cyclone Oswald and among the main producers in the region are Rio Tinto, down 57p at \u00a335.18, and BHP Billiton, 34.5p lower at \u00a321.04. Anglo American lost 8.5p to \u00a318.86 after it reported quarterly production numbers which had been hit by strikes in South Africa. Iron ore production fell 19% while platinum dropped 29%. Evraz, the steel producer controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, fell 6.9p to 300p after a negative note from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Polymetal was an exception, up 26p to \u00a311.16 after renewed talk the Russian precious metals miner could link up with peer Polyus Gold, up 3p at 221.5p. UBS upgraded Polymetal from neutral to buy and raised its price target from \u00a311.70 to \u00a313.00, saying: We have raised our 12-month price target by 11% reflecting the recent resource base expansion by Polymetal and latest results. As a result we raised 2012 -2014 earnings per share forecast by 5% to 30%. We think that now is the right moment to use weakness in the stock price as potential merger with Polyus Gold may be a strong driver. BG, which was once again the subject of reheated bid rumours during the week, dropped 5.5p to 1165.5p as traders turned more sceptical. Vodafone was in demand on hopes of corporate action. The mobile phone group added 1.6p to 170.25p , helped by a positive endorsement on Thursday from hedge fund Greenlight, run by David Einhorn. In an update to investors, Einhorn joined those speculating that its US joint venture partner Verizon might decide to buy Vodafone: It could decide to become a global telecom leader or it could spin out parts of Vodafone that it's not interested in owning. Vodafone also benefited from positive figures from the partnership, Verizon Wireless, during the week, as well as a buy note from Goldman Sachs. Disappointing results from Apple left its shares down nearly 10% on Thursday and another 1% in early trading on Friday. Citigroup analyst Glen Yeung said: We suspect Apple's results will do little to assuage investors' concerns about share and profitability. While at record levels, iPhone shipments represented market share loss in the smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2012. While we have little doubt that Apple will introduce new product to regain share (low-end iPhone), their disproportionate share of global handset profit seems at risk. With so many uncertainties, now supported by falling consensus estimates, we believe investors will continue to focus on risks in the Apple story, limiting share appreciation. We stand by our recent downgrade and continue to rate the shares neutral. On lower estimates, our price target falls to $500 from $575. But Morgan Stanley kept its overweight stance on the business: We believe Apple shares discount a significant deceleration in revenue and earnings growth that is unjustified in light of multiple medium- and long-term growth The US giant's figures put the spotlight on its suppliers. Chip designer Arm added 3p to 870.5p, as investors took comfort from the company's prospects in the growing tablet market. But rival Imagination Technologies fell 7p to 450.1p while Laird, which makes heat-control devices for iPhones and iPads, edged up 0.6p to 224p after losing more than 8p on Thursday. Finally, Enterprise Inns rose 6.8p to 101.8p head of a trading update next week. Panmure Gordon repeated its buy recommendation and 123p price target. Analyst Simon French said: After a relatively difficult start to [its financial year] we anticipate trading picked up in December but has weakened in January (snow) and now expect the group to report at least a 2% decline (previously 1% decline) in like for like income for the total pub estate. Debt reduction remains a priority for the group but with strong free cash flow generation and a steady income from disposal proceeds we believe the market will continue to take a more positive view of the medium-term equity accretion. We do not foresee a risk to earnings from the proposed introduction of a statutory code and industry adjudicator. The stock trades on a discount to [rivals] Greene King, Fuller's, Punch Taverns and Young's.",

Geithner told the New Republic he \"never quite understood why the financial community took such offense at what was such moderate rhetoric relative to what we have seen in other periods in history.\" The treasury secretary said high unemployment was still one of the worst legacies of the financial crisis. \"That's the unavoidable, terrible, tragic legacy of a financial crisis this bad,\" he said. He said there was \"very substantial room\" for fiscal policy to bring the rate of unemployment down but that would be easier to do \"if it was accompanied by some credible long-term plan to bring down future deficits.\" Geithner said the response to the 2008 financial crisis significantly reduced the \"probability and the intensity of crises for a long period of time.\" But another crisis is inevitable, he suggested. \"I know that markets over time will find their way around those things, and memories will fade. But if we're lucky that will take a long time,\" he said. The Treasury Department put out a blog post on Friday detailing 75 facts about its 75th secretary. Geithner spent more than 167 hours testifying before Congress, appearing at 67 hearings during his tenure. He logged 600,000 miles on international trips and his signature appears on 17bn notes. Asked what he will do next Geithner said he had no immediate plans. \"I've been doing this for a long time. I'm going to take a long time to think about what I do next. As I should,\" he said. Obama has nominated Jack Lew, White House chief of staff, to replace Geithner. \"Someone said that the country, this country today, now longs for a time when most Americans will, once again, have no idea who the Secretary of the Treasury is. But Jack won't have that luxury. He'll still face some of the toughest challenges anyone could face in economic policy. And he will be great at it,\" Geithner said in his parting speech last week.",

In the 10 quarters since the election, manufacturing has contracted by 0.4% and the construction sector has shrunk by 9%, the TUC said. The contraction in GDP in the fourth quarter followed a near 1% rise in the third quarter when the economy was boosted by the Olympics. A survey of economists had predicted a 0.1% drop in GDP in the fourth quarter, though several prominent analysts had forecast a bigger contraction after a series of surveys last year showed the manufacturing industry suffering from a downturn in exports. The ONS data showed that within the manufacturing sector, mining and quarrying output suffered its biggest decline since records began because of maintenance on North Sea oil and gas fields. In the powerhouse services sector activity ground to a halt in the fourth quarter due to the absence of the London Games boost in the previous three months. The only bright spot was construction, which delivered a 0.3% rise in output.

These deeply disappointing figures expose just how dangerously complacent the prime minister was when he said last autumn that the \u2018good news will keep coming\u2019.</p> <p>Today's news confirms what business leaders, retailers and families have known for many months - that depressed confidence and a chronic shortage of demand mean our economy continues to flatline. This government\u2019s failing plan has now seen our economy stagnate for over two years and borrowing is now rising as a result.</p> </blockquote> <p>He urges the chancellor to listen to growing calls for him to ease off on austerity.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is grossly irresponsible and out of touch of George Osborne to once again try to shrug off bad news and refuse to heed the advice now coming to him from right, left and centre. The chancellor should listen and act now to give direct help to struggling families and businesses. Instead, the only people he is helping are millionaires who will get a tax cut in April, on the same day that millions of working families have their tax credits cut. This kind of Tory trickle-down economics is just not going to work.</p> <p>As the IMF has warned again this week, we need a change of course in the budget with policies to kickstart our flatlining economy. A plan B now should include a compulsory jobs guarantee for the long-term unemployed and a temporary VAT cut to boost family incomes and our struggling high streets. We should also bring forward infrastructure investment, including building thousands of affordable homes, and establish a British Investment Bank to boost lending to small businesses.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-01-25T11:19:45.466Z\">at 11.19am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-510264f5b5797705e2474f6e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-25T10:56:56.877Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE remained relatively unmoved by the grim news on GDP, writes my colleague Nick Fletcher.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK stock market has shrugged off the below-par GDP figures, with the FTSE 100 up 9.10 points at 6274.01, continuing the new year rally which has pushed the index to a near five-year high.</p> <p>Andrew Edwards, chief executive of ETX Capital, said: \"The UK index is trading near its highs for the year, barely affected by the poor GDP numbers and firmly above the 6250 level. So despite the low growth environment in the UK, investors clearly still see value in the market and will continue to do so during the year.</p> <p>European markets are also moving higher, with Germany's Dax up 83 points or more than 1% after a better than expected business confidence survey which pointed to the country's continuing economic recovery.

If the recent slight pick-up in money supply growth can be sustained, the UK economic outlook in 2013 will be better than people expect. So hold back on the doom and gloom.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-510260f995cbb113c43e9cbf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-25T10:39:53.523Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Goldman Sachs tells Osobrne to change path</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But it is not just firebrand union bosses saying that.

      "bodyText": "So, for a round-up of the news and reaction. UK GDP dropped by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2012, prompting fears Britain could be on course for its third recession in four years. (full-story here) Chancellor George Osborne has blamed debts built up under Labour, and the eurozone crisis for the UK's ailing economy. (see 10.05am) Britain risks losing its prized triple-A rating, warn economists. (see 10.08am) Sterling plunged on the news (see 10.12am) but stock markets were relatively unmoved. (see 10.56am) Osborne's strategy has failed - Larry Elliott. (full analysis here) We'll close the GDP live blog now, but will be reporting on all the developments from Davos, the eurozone and beyond, over on the Davos live blog. Thanks for all your comments. Labour says (somewhat predictably) that the GDP figures prove that Osborne's plan is not working. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: Today is the moment when David Cameron and George Osborne\u2019s complacency is completely exposed. These deeply disappointing figures expose just how dangerously complacent the prime minister was when he said last autumn that the \u2018good news will keep coming\u2019. Today's news confirms what business leaders, retailers and families have known for many months - that depressed confidence and a chronic shortage of demand mean our economy continues to flatline. This government\u2019s failing plan has now seen our economy stagnate for over two years and borrowing is now rising as a result. He urges the chancellor to listen to growing calls for him to ease off on austerity. It is grossly irresponsible and out of touch of George Osborne to once again try to shrug off bad news and refuse to heed the advice now coming to him from right, left and centre. The chancellor should listen and act now to give direct help to struggling families and businesses. Instead, the only people he is helping are millionaires who will get a tax cut in April, on the same day that millions of working families have their tax credits cut. This kind of Tory trickle-down economics is just not going to work. As the IMF has warned again this week, we need a change of course in the budget with policies to kickstart our flatlining economy. A plan B now should include a compulsory jobs guarantee for the long-term unemployed and a temporary VAT cut to boost family incomes and our struggling high streets. We should also bring forward infrastructure investment, including building thousands of affordable homes, and establish a British Investment Bank to boost lending to small businesses. The FTSE remained relatively unmoved by the grim news on GDP, writes my colleague Nick Fletcher. The UK stock market has shrugged off the below-par GDP figures, with the FTSE 100 up 9.10 points at 6274.01, continuing the new year rally which has pushed the index to a near five-year high. Andrew Edwards, chief executive of ETX Capital, said: \"The UK index is trading near its highs for the year, barely affected by the poor GDP numbers and firmly above the 6250 level. So despite the low growth environment in the UK, investors clearly still see value in the market and will continue to do so during the year. European markets are also moving higher, with Germany's Dax up 83 points or more than 1% after a better than expected business confidence survey which pointed to the country's continuing economic recovery. As a consequence, France's Cac has climbed 0.68% and Spain's Ibex is up 0.46%. But the Institute of Directors sounds a more upbeat note. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the institute, said: You can\u2019t see the road ahead through the rear view mirror. The GDP fall was largely attributable to the unwinding of the Olympic effect and so the underlying story is that output is flat. The critical factor is not what the GDP figures did in the fourth quarter but what the broad money supply figures will do in the first quarter. If the recent slight pick-up in money supply growth can be sustained, the UK economic outlook in 2013 will be better than people expect. So hold back on the doom and gloom. But it is not just firebrand union bosses saying that. Goldman Sachs's chief economist, Jim O'Neill, told ITV News the coalition government should think again about prioritising its credit rating rather than growth. O'Neill said it was not easy to tell why GDP was bad ... \"other than the very bleak conclusion that policy has been on the wrong path, fiscal policy has tightened too much\". Austerity is not working, say the unions, following news that the economy shrank by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2012. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: Today's figures confirm our worst fears that the chancellor's austerity plan has pushed the UK economy to the brink of an unprecedented triple-dip recession. We are now mid-way through the coalition's term of office and its economic strategy has been a complete disaster. The economy has grown by just 1%, real wages have fallen, and the manufacturing and construction sectors have shrunk. We remain as dependent on the City as we did before the financial crash. The chancellor now has all the evidence he needs to change course and focus instead on investment and growth. If he refuses to listen he could do even more permanent damage to the economy. The latest GDP figures show that in the 10 quarters since the election, manufacturing has contracted by 0.4% and the construction sector has shrunk by 9%. George Osborne's strategy has failed, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott, who is over in Davos. The strategy has failed. The public knows it. The International Monetary Fund knows it. The credit rating agencies know it. Even George Osborne knows it, although he can\u2019t bring himself to admit as much. Here is a brief resume of how things stand for the economy after two and a half years with the coalition government at the helm. National output has just contracted for the fourth quarter in the last five. The only quarter of 2012 in which the economy expanded was the one that contained the London Olympics, and unfortunately for the chancellor these sort of jamborees happen once every half century rather than once every three months. During 2012 as a whole the economy registered no growth at all. Nothing. Zilch. A big fat zero. The level of gross domestic product is 3% below where it was when the recession started, a weaker performance than during the 1930s. RBS says the four-year performance of the economy between 2008 and 2012 is the weakest since the 1930s apart from post-war mobilisations. We'll have more comment from Larry up online shortly. Britain could be on course for its third recession in four years after the economy shrank by 0.3% in the last three months of 2012, writes my colleague Phillip Inman. A fall in manufacturing output dragged down the economy, countering a small rise in construction between October and December last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. The figures were worse than expected and could put pressure on the government to consider a \"Plan B\" that would stimulate demand. The prospect of a triple-dip recession, which will become official should the economy contract again in the first quarter of 2013, is expected to further dent the confidence of consumers and companies, hitting high street spending and business investment. The contraction in GDP followed a near 1% rise in GDP in the third quarter when the economy had been boosted by the Olympics. On Thursday chancellor George Osborne was forced to rebut comments by the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund that the UK should ease back on austerity to give the ailing economy a boost. The economy remains 3.5% below its peak in 2007 and is not expected to regain its previous level for at least another two years, making it the longest recovery in 100 years. Sterling is being slaughtered on the GDP news and the triple-A rating looks under threat, writes a foreign exchange specialist. Glenn Uniacke, head of options at the forex specialist Moneycorp said: Sterling is being slaughtered - and has already fallen below last year's low against the euro. The tanking pound is curiously at odds with the soaring stock market, but that will be of little comfort to struggling importers. With Britain's economy back in reverse and the government set to miss its deficit targets, our much-prized AAA credit rating is looking shakier by the day. The markets now talk of when, not if, the UK's credit rating is downgraded - with estimates running from any time between now and the moment the country officially returns to recession. But the pound has already fallen so far, the one crumb of comfort is that if Britain is downgraded, the markets will have priced it in so much that any further fall will be limited. So sterling shouldn't fall off a cliff post-downgrade. But that modest achievement is only because it's shuffling down the cliff face already. The news has also prompted economists to question whether the UK can hold on to its prized triple-A rating. Chris Williamson at Markit writes: At the moment it remains too early to tell if the economy will triple-dip, but today's numbers have greatly increased the risk of a new recession and a downgrading of the UK's AAA credit rating. As such, the data pile ever more pressure on the chancellor to seek ways to revive the economy in the March budget. There's a lot of comment on the weakness of the recovery, as demonstrated by today's GDP figures. Fraser Nelson at the Spectator writes: Now we know why David Cameron delivered his Europe speech on Wednesday. It\u2019s time for bad headlines again: the GDP figures just announced show that the British economy is contracting for a third time \u2014 by 0.3 percent in the final quarter of last year. Now, you\u2019ll hear a lot of people tell you today that quarterly data does not matter. The ONS say this is a fallback from the Olympics, which sucked economic growth forward. And they\u2019re right: the ONS usually revises quarterly data, often dramatically. What matters more is the long-term trend, and this is pretty appalling. It now seems inarguable that Britain is going through the worst recovery in history. Slower and longer even than the 1930s. Chancellor George Osborne is speaking in Davos about the figures, blaming the buildup of debt under Labour and the crisis in the eurozone for Britain's shaky economic figures. He said: We have a reminder today that Britain faces a very difficult economic situation. A reminder that last year was particularly difficult, that we face problems at home because of the debts built up over many years and problems abroad with the eurozone, where we export most of our products, in recession. Now, we can either run away from those problems or we can confront them and I am determined to confront them so that we can go on creating jobs for the people of this country. The FTSE has stayed pretty robust, considering the dire GDP figures. It is still up by 0.1%, or 6 points, at 6271. There are some factors that could point towards a better 2013, says the manufacturers' organisation. Lee Hopley, economist at the EEF, said: The big euro-exit risk has diminished, the employment picture is better than expected and manufacturers are continuing to look to new markets for growth. That said, government must hit the accelerator on getting capital projects moving and be clearer about its economic priorities to give businesses more confidence to invest for the future. But she took a dim view of the GDP figures: There are no positive takeaways from today\u2019s first estimate of GDP in the final months of last year. Even assuming some unwinding of activity from the Olympics boost in the previous quarter, this still leaves no real signs of underlying growth in the economy. The news from industry was particularly weak, with November\u2019s sharp drop on output contributing to a rather grim fourth quarter and leaving the overall picture for manufacturing in 2012 the weakest since 2009. The UK economy will not return to the levels seen in the first quarter of 2008 until the first half of 2015, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight in a very gloomy reaction to the GDP figures. He writes: With the economy suffering a renewed GDP dip in the fourth quarter of 2012, the definition of the current state of the UK economy as DIRE needs to be amended from Disappointing Inflation Rotten Expansion to Disappointing Inflation Reduced Economy While we believe the economy is essentially flat at the moment, it is worrying to note that GDP in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 3.3% below the peak level seen in the first quarter of 2008. We suspect that GDP will not return to the level seen in the first quarter of 2008 until the first half of 2015 - a gap of seven years. And finally from Simon Neville: The final drops of coffee are drunk, while ONS spokesmen do the rounds of radio and TV interviews. Then the assembled journalists (I count six) skulk off to the next job of the day Taking a closer look at the ONS announcement. Here are some of the key points: Output of the production industries was estimated to have decreased by 1.8% in Q4 2012 compared with Q3 2012, following an increase of 0.7% between Q2 2012 and Q3 2012. Construction sector output was estimated to have increased by 0.3% in Q4 2012 compared with Q3 2012, following a decrease of 2.5% between Q2 2012 and Q3 2012. Output of the service industries was estimated to have been flat in Q4 2012 compared with Q3 2012, following an increase of 1.2% between Q2 2012 and Q3 2012. GDP was estimated to have been flat in Q4 2012, when compared with Q4 2011. GDP is estimated to have been flat between 2011 and 2012. Users are, however, reminded that this figure is subject to revision in the second estimate of GDP when all quarters of 2012 are open for revision. More from my colleague Simon Neville over at the GDP press conference: Joe Grice, chief economist for the ONS who made this morning's announcement, tells me that the margin of error usually sees today's figures revised up or down by 0.2% when more data comes in, meaning the best case scenario is GDP for Q4 was down 0.1%, so we're still on our way to another recession. He added: \"If there are exceptional circumstances this could change the figures by more than 0.2%. We saw that during the diamond jubilee.\" However, he doesn't seem to think anything happened in Q4 that could alter the figures into positive territory. The news has hit the pound hard, with sterling falling to a five-month low of $1.575, from $1.581 before the GDP figures were released. The euro, meanwhile, rose to a fresh 11-month high against sterling of 85.25p. The Treasury has just issued a statement saying: It confirms what we already knew - that Britain, like many European countries, still faces a very difficult economic situation. While the economy is healing it is a difficult road. \u2026 from @nickvanmead Economists at Capital Economics do not expect an immediate reaction from policymakers. The MPC was braced for a fall, while the chancellor yesterday suggested that a weak GDP figure would not cause him to change course. However, the fact that the economy is contracting more than three years after the recession first ended suggests that the current policy stance isn\u2019t working and more action needs to be taken. Taking a closer look at the announcement, the Office for National Statistics says the data show Britain, like other European countries, still faces a very difficult economic situation. It blamed the decline on lower output from the North Sea and manufacturers. The economy is now 3.3% smaller than its peak in the first quarter of 2008, recovering only about half the output lost during the financial crisis - a worse performance than other major economies. Some reaction from RBS, which puts the decline in GDP since the crisis in historical perspective. Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Britain is now halfway to a triple-dip recession after this disappointingly weak performance. The economy clearly lost momentum in the final three months of 2012 after the one-off boost from the Olympics in the summer. This adds to the pressure on George Osborne to ease up on his austerity programme and provide a growth boost in the budget. The economy flatlined in 2012 as a whole. Seems those upbeat rumours were off the mark and NIESR was right again. And the results are in... UK GDP declined 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012. That's a dreadful result for George Osborne, he was clearly putting a brave face on it. There's talk that Osborne will be digesting the result from Davos. We'll have that and all the reaction to the news as it comes in. And one last rumour before we get the actual number. Financial Spread Trader again writes: Just got an SMS text mesg from one of the traders (very reliable one) who informed me today that the UK GDP was leaked and will beat forecast tomorrow, I broke this story earlier today on twitter. Text mesg states the UK GDP tomorrow at 09:30GMT will be +0.2% or better, forecast is for -0.1%. Apparently the leaked source wants \u00a3300,000 for supplying the actual number and has a number of offers. If all is true, then a Pre- GDP buy on GBP/USD would fit well with current technicals at 1.5750-70 with a view of 1.5890 tomorrow. My colleague Simon Neville is down in Westminster to report on the announcement. He writes: A poor showing at the ONS GDP results live from Westminster. The London weather might be as chilly as Davos but that is where the similarities end, for while the world's movers and shakers quaff champagne, we make do with coffee and a surprisingly large array of teas. One PR bod asks me to sit at the front and look busy for the cameras that are here. He sighs: \"It used to be such a busy event.\" What's more George Osborne seemed very upbeat at the World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday. Questioned about Britain's economic situation, he said: We are walking a difficult road but we are heading in the right direction. There was his lively dinner with David Cameron and Boris Johnson last night. As Greenpeace's head of media notes, it could be a good sign for the economy. But enough of the doom and gloom, there were rumours swirling yesterday that the Office for National Statistics might have a surprise in store and that GDP figures could show a positive reading. One market player wrote on the Financial Spread Trader blog: I have been told by a few traders on our trade desk that the UK GDP scheduled for release tomorrow has been leaked, rumors doing the rounds across many dealing and trade desks is that the figure is better than forecasted, GBP\u00a3 positive. Of course this is currently a market rumour, but in the past when such traders have given me this kind of information pre-news release, they have been accurate a very large percentage of the time. The figures will also show how weak the 'recovery' from this financial crisis continues to be. Here's another pretty chart from NIESR comparing the UK's economic recovery following the last six crises. The black line shows our current position. But how likely is it that we head towards triple-dip with today's GDP figures? The consensus estimate among City economists is for a 0.1% decline in GDP in the fourth quarter. But some analysts are much more pessimistic. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research expects a 0.3% decline. It said output was artificially high in the third quarter, when the economy grew 0.9%. That surge, which ended nine months of contraction, stemmed largely from ticket sales for the Olympic Games held in London over the summer. Although the tickets were sold throughout 2011 and the first half of 2012, they were allocated to the national accounts only in the third quarter, inflating the level of output. Removing these distortions suggests an underlying economic performance that is best described as flat. NIESR's record of guessing these things is pretty good, as it boasts on its website. To get a bit of perspective on what it means to fall into a triple dip, the Press Association has provided some helpful stats. According to the Office for National Statistics, there has not been a triple-dip recession since its records began in 1955, with Britain last suffering such economic gloom in the Great Depression. More from PA: But the UK did experience some shaky economic times in the 1970s, when the economy came very close to a triple-dip recession, slipping in and out of negative territory. Largely caused by the 1973 oil crisis, the UK was in recession for two years in the mid 1970s and it took 14 quarters for GDP to recover to levels seen before the start of the recession - during which time it slipped into a double-dip recession and nearly a triple. Britons also faced eye-watering stagflation in the 70s, when negative GDP combined with high inflation. Inflation peaked at more than 20% during that recession, putting today's above-target UK inflation of 2.7% in perspective. The FTSE opened down but has inched up recently, currently trading up 3 points or 0.06% at 6269 points. The pound hit a 10-month low against a basket of currencies. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets writes: The health of the UK economy is also set to come under the microscope this morning, with the first publication of Q4 GDP, and expectations have gradually been revised lower in light of the recent disappointing retail sales and services PMI data seen over the last few months. In the last few days we\u2019ve seen sterling long positions been given a good shake out, as the pound has dropped sharply across the board in anticipation of a poor number. Expectations are for a negative quarter of -0.1% after Q3\u2019s Olympics enhanced 0.9%, however this is the optimistic scenario with some estimates of -0.5% being bandied about on a worst case scenario. This in turn will ensure that the whole of 2012 will show a net contraction in the UK economy and increase speculation about further action from the Bank of England at next month\u2019s MPC meeting. With Chancellor George Osborne rejecting the option of a Plan B from the IMF, expect the pound to come under further pressure in anticipation of an imminent ratings downgrade as well as speculation about the discussion of additional measures, whether or not they ultimately get delivered. Good morning and welcome to our GDP live blog. At 9.30 today we will find out whether the economy grew or contracted in the final quarter of 2012. Until recently the smart money was on a contraction (the sweepstake in our office runs from 0 down to -0.5%) but there was talk yesterday that it could be positive. Post your guesses in the comments below. If the economy did shrink that puts Britain on the road to an unprecedented triple-dip recession. It won't be called a recession today, as that requires two quarters of contraction. But, with snow disrupting the economy in January, analysts say it's likely GDP will drop this quarter.",
