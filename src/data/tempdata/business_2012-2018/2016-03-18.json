      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has tabled a \u00a31.4bn takeover of Home Retail Group after South African retail group Steinhoff ditched plans to make a rival bid for the Argos owner. The supermarket confirmed its offer with less than half an hour to go before a 5pm deadline on Friday set by the Takeover Panel. Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, said: \u201cThe combination of Home Retail and Sainsbury\u2019s is a powerful one that will create long term shareholder value for both companies.\u201d He insisted the merger was not risky but \u201cwell within the executional capabilities\u201d of the Sainsbury\u2019s management team. The Sainsbury\u2019s cash and shares bid marks no change from the deal agreed with Home Retail\u2019s board last month. At the time, Home Retail said it would be prepared to recommend an offer at that level to shareholders. Sainsbury\u2019s said on Friday that it had not secured a recommendation from Home Retail\u2019s board ahead of the Takeover Panel\u2019s deadline - which it attributed to the late withdrawal of Steinhoff\u2019s offer. Home Retail said it was looking forward to \u201cworking towards a recommendation\u201d. The unchanged bid is likely to be disappointing for the Argos-owner\u2019s shareholders who were hoping that \u00a3100m extra in annual cash reserves revealed by Home Retail last week and a competing bid from Steinhoff would lead to a higher offer. Steinhoff, which owns furniture chains Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK, released a statement to the stock exchange in London confirming withdrawal of its \u00a31.42bn offer on Friday afternoon. Home Retail\u2019s shares closed down nearly 10% at 163.2p and Sainsbury\u2019s shares closed down nearly 3% at 273.2p after Steinhoff withdrew its offer. Markus Jooste, CEO of Steinhoff, said Home Retail was a \u201ccompelling business with unique attributes that remains attractive on many fronts\u201d. But he added: \u201cHaving concluded our due diligence review and ancillary discussions, we have evaluated our findings against our investment criteria and today come to a decision not to proceed.\u201d The reason for Steinhoff\u2019s withdrawal became clear minutes later when the company, which also owns the Conforama electricals and furniture chain in France, confirmed it had agreed a deal to buy French electronics retailer Darty for \u00a3673m. The withdrawal of Steinhoff\u2019s potential offer cleared the way for Sainsbury\u2019s to finalise its planned takeover of Home Retail which has been under discussion since last year. Sainsbury\u2019s sees the acquisition of Argos as a way to accelerate its attempts to tap into the fast growing online market. Sainsbury\u2019s said the merger would create \u201ca leading food and non-food retailer of choice for customers, building on the strong heritage of both the Sainsbury\u2019s and HRG businesses whose brands are renowned for trust, quality, value and customer service.\u201d The company also said it had found \u00a340m more financial benefits in merging its operations with Home Retail \u2013 taking the total to \u00a3160m \u2013 after looking through the Argos-owner\u2019s books over the last few weeks. Sainsbury\u2019s said it believed it could add more Argos stores and increase savings by combining central operations \u2013 potentially meaning more head office job cuts. It made clear that it would not overpay for Argos, so shareholders will be watching closely to see if Sainsbury\u2019s has been forced to increase its offer to oust Steinhoff from the process.",

      "bodyText": "After a bright start European shares came off their best levels, as the crude price slipped back from its highs after the Baker Hughes rig data. But, apart from the UK market, they still managed to end the day in positive terrirtory after a strong start on Wall Street. The recent rally follows the revival in the oil price on hopes that major producers will agree an output freeze, and the dovish comments from the US Federal Reserve about the prospect of further interest rate rises, which has in turn weakened the dollar. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 may have come within 5 points of those highs for the year, but the upward momentum failed to last as a lack of good news continues to plague the market \u2013 at least in London. It\u2019s interesting to note that markets on mainland Europe and in North America continue to wriggle higher, but with factors like oil failing to extend its gains also in play and a resurgent pound hitting sterling-denominated assets in general, the mood is decidedly muted. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 11.48 points or 0.19% to 6189.64, but still ended up 0.8% on the week Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.59% to 9950.80 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.44% higher at 4462.51 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.02% to 18,611.34 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.81% better at 9051.1 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 88 points or 0.5%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Here\u2019s the Baker Hughes rig count showing oil rigs up by one, but gas rigs falling: The number of oil rigs drilling in the US has climbed for the first time in 12 weeks, according to the Baker Hughes rig count, albeit by just one rig. The news has sent crude prices falling again after their early gains. Brent crude is now down 0.2% at $41.45 a barrel, well down on its earlier level of $42.54. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is 0.5% lower at $39.96 a barrel. Here\u2019s ratings agency S&amp;P on Russia: S&amp;P said Russia\u2019s ratings remained constrained by the weak political institutions which are impeding the economy\u2019s competitiveness. On sanctions, it expected them to remain in place over its forecasting period. Earlier we reported the idea that central bankers meeting in Shanghai last month may have made a secret deal to prevent the dollar strengthening any further. But economist Julian Jessop at research group Capital Economics is not convinced: The dollar\u2019s further slide since this month\u2019s [US Federal Reserve] meeting has increased speculation that G20 officials meeting in Shanghai last month came to some sort of deal to end the US currency\u2019s strength. But this speculation makes no sense on close inspection. The speculative story runs something as follows. Central bankers in the advanced economies are worried about the market volatility that might be caused by further strength in the US dollar. Specific concerns presumably include the impact on US corporate earnings, additional weakness in commodity prices, financial strains in emerging markets with large external debts, and a greater risk that the [Chinese central bank] would undertake a major devaluation of the renminbi. In this narrative, central bankers have agreed to coordinate monetary policies to cap the dollar against other major currencies. Consistent with this, the communiqu\u00e9 said a little more than usual on currencies, adding a new commitment to \u201cconsult closely on exchange markets\u201d. What\u2019s more, the dollar has indeed weakened against both the euro and the yen since the meeting concluded in late- February. In turn, this has allowed the renminbi to fall slightly further on a trade-weighted basis, despite a small appreciation against the US currency. However, we doubt that Shanghai marked a lasting turning point. For a start, the new language in the communiqu\u00e9 went only very slightly further than previous warnings about \u201cexcess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates\u201d and commitments to \u201crefrain from competitive devaluations\u201d. Moreover, the dollar had peaked against both the euro and (particularly) the yen some months earlier. Above all, since the G20 the ECB has unveiled a package of bold stimulus measures that might have been expected to weaken the euro. Admittedly, the euro still rebounded after President Draghi\u2019s remark that ECB interest rates have may have bottomed out, but it is hard to believe that was the outcome he intended. Indeed, the equity markets of both the euro-zone and (especially) Japan have stuttered as a result of the appreciation of their respective currencies. ECB officials have since reinforced the message that policy could be loosened further if required. And while the Bank of Japan did opt to leave monetary policy settings on hold in March, it left plenty of room for additional easing next month. We also think that the markets have read too much into the [Fed\u2019s] latest projections. The median forecast of participants implies that they only expect to raise rates twice this year, but the mean forecast is still consistent with up to three hikes. Either outcome would be a faster pace of tightening than currently priced into fed funds futures. The Fed\u2019s apparent dovishness could also soon evaporate if inflation pressures continue to build, even if this means renewed dollar strength. The upshot is that we continue to expect the US currency to resume its climb against the euro and the yen in the coming months, as monetary policy divergence comes back to the fore. The latest survey shows that around 80% of foreign-owned UK financial assets were held in either the euro-zone or the US in the middle of last year, up from around 70% a decade or so ago. (See Chart.) It also reveals that the amounts of UK financial assets that are held in the euro-zone and the US are broadly similar, even though the UK does approximately four times as much trade with the euro-zone than it does with the US. Breaking news Just ahead of the bid deadline, Sainsbury\u2019s has unveiled its \u00a31.4bn offer for Home Retail Group, including a special dividend. It values the Argos owner at 173.2p a share. Sainsbury\u2019s says that after due diligence it expects a higher level of synergies from the deal, up from \u00a3120m to \u00a3160m. Wall Street is moving sharply higher, German and French markets are in positive territory but the FTSE 100 has fallen back into the red. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Risk appetite is fading as the session heads to its close, with the FTSE 100 back in the red, ten points lower from the open. The 6200 level continues to stand in the way of the FTSE 100, with the five-week rally stymied for lack of good news. European markets are still in positive territory, although they are also off their highs. A rally needs momentum, and the lack of it on the FTSE over the past few sessions sends a warning that the last two weeks of March may not see the same bullish atmosphere that dominated of late. Looking forward, however, a weaker US dollar, stronger commodity prices and supportive central banks would seem to bode well for more gains into April and May, particularly given the way dips in oil continue to be furiously bought. Here\u2019s our latest Home Retail story, from Sarah Butler: Sainsbury\u2019s is on course to take over Home Retail Group for \u00a31.4bn after South African retail group Steinhoff said it had ditched plans to make a rival bid for the Argos owner. Steinhoff, which owns furniture chains Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK, released a statement to the stock exchange in London confirming its withdrawal on Friday afternoon. Home Retail Group\u2019s shares dived about 11% and Sainsbury\u2019s shares fell just over 3% on the news that Steinhoff had withdrawn. Markus Jooste, CEO of Steinhoff, said Home Retail was a \u201ccompelling business with unique attributes that remains attractive on many fronts\u201d and expressed appreciation for the professional manner in which the company had handled the bid process. But he added: \u201cHaving concluded our due diligence review and ancillary discussions, we have evaluated our findings against our investment criteria and today come to a decision not to proceed with a firm intention announcement and offer.\u201d The full story is here: Steinhoff did have other things on its plate - its French business Conforama has agreed to buy electrical retailer Darty. Here\u2019s Sarah Butler on the South African group\u2019s other deals from our story earlier: Steinhoff, which has an international retail empire, is currently working on a number of other deals. Some analysts believe Steinhoff may lose interest in Home Retail if the price gets too high as it also currently bidding for electrical goods retailer Darty in France and is also rumoured to be looking at Australian electronics chain The Good Guys. It is also backing the expansion of Pep &amp; Co, a new budget clothing chain being developed by Andy Bond, the former boss of UK supermarket chain Asda. Home Retail shares have fallen 6% after the sudden end to the bid battle for the Argos owner. Sainsbury\u2019s shares, by contrast, have climbed 0.3%, on the basis that it may not now have to raise its offer to \u00a31.5bn. Breaking news: South Africa\u2019s Steinhoff has just announced it will not make an offer for Argos owner Home Retail ahead of a 5pm deadline., clearing the way for Sainsbury\u2019s. As well as weak consumer confidence figures from the US, there has also been downbeat data from Belgium and the Netherlands. In Belgium confidence fell for the third month to a five month low of -7 in March, while in the Netherlands it slipped to a 13 month low of -4. Economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: Early signs for consumer confidence across the Eurozone in March are not good, with declines in the Netherlands (to a 13-month low) and in Belgium (to a 5-month low). This will fuel concern over whether consumers will help Eurozone GDP growth to pick up in the near term from current lacklustre levels \u2013 even though the fundamentals for consumers still look pretty decent. With the race to the White House well underway, politics could be playing a part in the US confidence figures, says James Knightley at ING Bank: Both the current conditions and the expectations components dropped, which is a bit disappointing given the rebound in equities and the strength in the labour market It could partially be down to the rise in gasoline prices from around $1.70 a gallon as the mid-point for the national average for February versus $1.97 a gallon as it stood yesterday (AAA data). It\u2019s possible that politics may also be weighing on sentiment given the preponderance of negative sound-bites. Nonetheless, we expect consumer spending to hold up given positive real wage growth and rising employment. Interestingly one year and 5-10 year inflation expectations rose to 2.7%, which is supportive of the Fed rate hike story. The survey\u2019s chief economist, Richard Curtin, said: Consumer confidence eased in early March due to increased concerns about prospects for the economy as well as the expectation that gas prices would inch upward during the year ahead.... While consumers do not anticipate a recession, they no longer expect the economy to outperform the 2.4% rate of economic growth recorded in the past two years. US consumers were less confident in March than expected, according to the latest University of Michigan survey. Its index fell from 91.7 in February to 90, down on the expected figure of 92.2. Positive signs from the Chinese economy are also giving some support to markets, particularly commodity companies as metal prices move higher. Copper climbed to a four month high after Chinese house prices rose at their fastest rate for almost two years in February. According to Reuters figures, prices climbed 3.6% compares to 2.5% in January. Wall Street has carried on where it left off on Thursday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average turned positive for the year. The Dow is up another 53 points or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.15% higher and Nasdaq 0.22% better. Rising oil prices, along with the US Federal Reserve\u2019s dovish comments on interest rates this week, is helping sentiment among investors. At the moment however, oil prices are far from sliding. Quite the reverse. Brent crude is up more than 2% at $42.43 a barrel, its highest level since December. Investors are hoping that Opec and other oil producers can agree to freeze output, despite reluctance from Iran which has just returned to world markets. At the same time there are signs the supply glut may be stabilising. The US Energy Information Administration said this week that crude inventories rose by 1.3m barrels last week, but this was less than the 3.4m increase analysts had been expecting. Also helping crude is weakness in the dollar following the US Federal Reserve trimming its expectations for further interest rate rises this year. A fall in the dollar makes oil more affordable to holders of other currencies. The slide in the oil price has driven down Canada\u2019s inflation rate. Prices were 1.4% higher year-on-year in February, down from 2% in January, and 0.2% higher month-on-month. Back in the markets, shares in developing countries have hit their highest levels since last December. The benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets index (MSCIEF), is up 0.8% on track for its third third weekly gain in a row. There\u2019s general relief that the US Federal Reserve is pledging to be cautious when normalising monetary policy; calming fears of capital outflows from emerging markets [EM] into the dollar. Per Hammarlund, chief EM strategist at SEB, explains: This latest rally has been driven by renewed appetite for EMs due to fewer rate hikes in the U.S Speaking of Russia.... Vladimir Putin\u2019s new rating agency is now open for business. The venture, called ACRA, is Moscow\u2019s attempt to hit back at the Western rating agencies which recently downgraded Russia to junk status. Russian officials say ACRA will give valuable new insight into the country\u2019s corporations, at a time when Moody\u2019s and Fitch are reducing their monitoring of the country. However.... there\u2019s understandable cynicism about ACRA\u2019s independence. As Paul McNamara of asset management firm GAM puts it (via Reuters): \u201cAny Russian agency would undoubtedly be regarded as being in the pocket of the Kremlin.... [It\u2019s] a standard response to being downgraded. Nobody in the market cares.\u201d More here: Newsflash from Moscow: The Russian central bank has left interest rates unchanged at an eye-wateringly high 11%. With inflation around 7%, the Bank of Russia clearly felt unable to ease monetary policy even though the country is in recession. In a statement, it warns that inflation risks remain high, despite recent stabilisation in the financial markets. And inflation could get a kick higher this summer due \u2018base effects\u2019 (because the oil price will no longer be lower than a year ago). So rates could remain high for longer than expected. This chart shows how the ECB has already driven interest rates down to record lows, putting a radical move like \u2018helicopter money\u2019 on the agenda: A senior European Central Bank policymaker has excited the markets by hinting that eurozone interest rates could be cut again. Peter Praet, an ECB executive board member, told the La Repubblica newspaper that further stimulus measures are possible. Last week\u2019s new package of interest rate cuts, cheaper credit and quantitative easing is not the final throw of the dice, Praet insisted. He said: This re-composition of the tool-box does not mean that we have thrown away any of our tools. If new negative shocks should worsen the outlook or if financing conditions should not adjust in the direction and to the extent that is necessary to boost the economy and inflation, a rate reduction remains in our armoury. And if all else fails, Praet says the ECB could even embark on \u2018helicopter money\u2019 and physically press cash into the public\u2019s hands, to force inflation up. Asked if \u201cin principle the ECB could print cheques and send them to people?\u201d, Praet says: Yes, all central banks can do it. You can issue currency and you distribute it to people. That\u2019s helicopter money. Helicopter money is giving to the people part of the net present value of your future seigniorage, the profit you make on the future banknotes. The question is, if and when is it opportune to make recourse to that sort of instrument which is really an extreme sort of instrument. There are other things you can theoretically do. There are several examples in the literature. So when we say we haven\u2019t reached the limit of the toolbox, I think that\u2019s true. This commitment to fresh stimulus has weakened the euro, sending it down 0.3% to $1.127, and also pushed shares higher in France and Germany. Europe still has a deflation problem, according to the latest measure of prices charged by German manufacturers at the factory gate. German producer prices fell by 3% year-on-year in February, a bigger fall than expected, partly due to a 9.4% slump in energy prices. Marilyn Watson at fund manager BlackRock told Bloomberg TV this morning that the US dollar should stabilise as traders take stock of recent developments. She believe investors are less worried about a slump in the Chinese yuan, and have also taken the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent cautious tone on board. Tony Cross, Trustnet Direct\u2019s market analyst, agrees that the Fed is supporting the markets: Wednesday\u2019s dovish note by the Federal Reserve may be continuing to lend support to global equity markets, with a weaker US dollar encouraging a risk-on mindset amongst many. European markets are pretty stable this morning, after seeing Wall Street hit 2016 highs last night. Mining companies are continuing to push higher, due to the weaker US dollar pushing up commodity prices. Money is still pouring into Japanese government debt today, following the recent imposition of negative interest rates. It\u2019s sending the rate of return on 10-year bonds to a new record low, further below zero. Speculation is swirling that central bankers have made a secret deal to prevent the US dollar strengthening any further. The theory is that global policymakers cooked up a plan when they met in Shanghai in last month, amid worries that the surge of money into the greenback was destabilising markets and fuelling deflation (by driving commodity prices downwards). Chris Weston of IG explains: To any conspiracy theorists it\u2019s all become quite clear. There is a global coordinated central bank effort to weaken the US dollar in play. He points out that many central banks have surprised the markets with fresh stimulus in the past few weeks (hello, Mario Draghi), or been much more dovish than expected (take a bow, Janet Yellen): Whether it\u2019s the People\u2019s Bank of China easing the Reserve Ratio Requirements (RRR) by 50 basis points, the RBNZ cutting its cash rate by 25 basis points (very much out of consensus), or the ECB moving to a focus on credit markets and going significantly above and beyond expectations. Of course, then we also have the Fed, who missed the economists\u2019 modestly hawkish playbook by about as wide a margin as we will likely see. Joachim Fels, global economic advisor at bond-trading firm PIMCO, also suspects something is afoot. He told Bloomberg that: \u201cThere seems to be some kind of tacit Shanghai Accord in place.\u201d \u201cThe agreement is to roughly stabilize the dollar versus the major currencies through appropriate monetary policy action, not through intervention.\u201d The promise of stimulus measures and easy monetary policy is sending world stock markets rallying. Last night, the Dow Jones industrial average turned positive for the year, putting the turmoil of January and February behind it. And that has fed through to Asia, where most markets have posted gains. The weaker US dollar is helping. It suffered its biggest losses since 2009 yesterday, after the US Federal Reserve admitted on Wednesday that it only expects to raise interest rates twice this year, not four times as previously pencilled in. Reuters has the details of today\u2019s Asian action. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8%, entering positive territory for the year for the first time. It is up 2.3% this week,and has surged 10.4% this month. The Hang Seng index was up 0.6 percent, heading for a weekly rise of 3.6%. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index and CSI 300 climbed about 1.9%,and were set for gains of about 6.4% for the week. Japan\u2019s Nikkei is missing out on the rally, though. Shares are being dragged down because the yen has risen against the US dollar, hurting Japanese exporters and hurting hopes of higher inflation. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another day dominated by talk about the global economy, and central banks\u2019 ability to improve the situation and ward off a crash. But Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, has given world leaders a clear message -- don\u2019t rely on us for everything. Speaking to reporters in Brussels last night during an EU summit on the refugee crisis, Draghi revealed he had told politician to do their bit and reform their economies. The ECB chief said: \u201cI made clear that even though monetary policy has been really the only policy driving the recovery in the last few years, it cannot address some basic structural weaknesses of the eurozone economy. \u201cFor that you need structural reforms, mostly driven to raise the level of demand, public investments and lower taxes. Even more importantly, one needs clarity on the future of our ... monetary union.\u201d Draghi is notorious for avoiding reporters on these occasions; he\u2019s got a great ability to move like a cat through the press who doorstep these summits. So when he stops to talk, he really wants his message out there. And perhaps he\u2019s worried that the new stimulus package announced by the ECB last week is going to encourage EU leaders to take their eye off the ball. Also coming up today.... UK supermarket chain Sainsbury, and South Africa\u2019s Steinhoff International, both have until 5pm GMT to launch a new takeover bid for Argos, the British catalogue retailer: Theres not much in the economic calendar, but we do get the latest count of US oil rigs this afternoon.

But, apart from the UK market, they still managed to end the day in positive terrirtory after a strong start on Wall Street. The recent rally follows the revival in the oil price on hopes that major producers will agree an output freeze, and the dovish comments from the US Federal Reserve about the prospect of further interest rate rises, which has in turn weakened the dollar. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The FTSE-100 may have come within 5 points of those highs for the year, but the upward momentum failed to last as a lack of good news continues to plague the market \u2013 at least in London.

But this speculation makes no sense on close inspection.</p> <p>The speculative story runs something as follows. Central bankers in the advanced economies are worried about the market volatility that might be caused by further strength in the US dollar. Specific concerns presumably include the impact on US corporate earnings, additional weakness in commodity prices, financial strains in emerging markets with large external debts, and a greater risk that the [Chinese central bank] would undertake a major devaluation of the renminbi. In this narrative, central bankers have agreed to coordinate monetary policies to cap the dollar against other major currencies.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58ad0cb5fbe165782bbf1743ffdd769432fcf833\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ad0cb5fbe165782bbf1743ffdd769432fcf833/0_0_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The People\u2019s Bank of China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The People\u2019s Bank of China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Consistent with this, the communiqu\u00e9 said a little more than usual on currencies, adding a new commitment to \u201cconsult closely on exchange markets\u201d. What\u2019s more, the dollar has indeed weakened against both the euro and the yen since the meeting concluded in late- February. In turn, this has allowed the renminbi to fall slightly further on a trade-weighted basis, despite a small appreciation against the US currency.</p> <p>However, we doubt that Shanghai marked a lasting turning point. For a start, the new language in the communiqu\u00e9 went only very slightly further than previous warnings about \u201cexcess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates\u201d and commitments to \u201crefrain from competitive devaluations\u201d. Moreover, the dollar had peaked against both the euro and (particularly) the yen some months earlier. Above all, since the G20 the ECB has unveiled a package of bold stimulus measures that might have been expected to weaken the euro.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c254b49a1f748dfc488d010bbde243ea50cb9f5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c254b49a1f748dfc488d010bbde243ea50cb9f5f/0_83_4168_2502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The European Central Bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The European Central Bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Roland/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Admittedly, the euro still rebounded after President Draghi\u2019s remark that ECB interest rates have may have bottomed out, but it is hard to believe that was the outcome he intended. Indeed, the equity markets of both the euro-zone and (especially) Japan have stuttered as a result of the appreciation of their respective currencies. ECB officials have since reinforced the message that policy could be loosened further if required. And while the Bank of Japan did opt to leave monetary policy settings on hold in March, it left plenty of room for additional easing next month.</p> <p>We also think that the markets have read too much into the [Fed\u2019s] latest projections. The median forecast of participants implies that they only expect to raise rates twice this year, but the mean forecast is still consistent with up to three hikes. Either outcome would be a faster pace of tightening than currently priced into fed funds futures. The Fed\u2019s apparent dovishness could also soon evaporate if inflation pressures continue to build, even if this means renewed dollar strength.</p> <p>The upshot is that we continue to expect the US currency to resume its climb against the euro and the yen in the coming months, as monetary policy divergence comes back to the fore. The latest survey shows that around 80% of foreign-owned UK financial assets were held in either the euro-zone or the US in the middle of last year, up from around 70% a decade or so ago. (See Chart.) It also reveals that the amounts of UK financial assets that are held in the euro-zone and the US are broadly similar, even though the UK does approximately four times as much trade with the euro-zone than it does with the US.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-03-18T16:46:12.939Z\">at 4.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56ec2f58e4b0fc0a5ab704f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-18T16:43:06.801Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking news</strong></p> <p><strong>Just ahead of the bid deadline, Sainsbury\u2019s has unveiled its \u00a31.4bn offer for Home Retail Group, including a special dividend.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Berkeley said that higher stamp duty has hit the luxury London housing market, sending its shares and other housebuilding stocks lower. The upmarket housebuilder, which focuses on London and the south-east, said reservations for new homes were 4% lower between November and February, compared with the same period a year earlier. It sold 62 homes worth more than \u00a32m each, a similar number to a year earlier, when the market slowed in the run-up to the general election. Berkeley warned that Britain\u2019s housing supply could be hit by what it called \u201cone of the world\u2019s highest property taxation regimes\u201d along with planning issues, pointing to \u201csometimes conflicting policies\u201d. It said: \u201cTransaction levels at the upper end of the housing market have been affected by the significant increase in transaction taxes over the past 18 months, which will have consequential effects on both social mobility and the supply of new homes.\u201d Purchases of homes costing more than \u00a3937,500m became more expensive after an overhaul of the stamp duty regime in December 2014. For example, the effective tax rate on a \u00a32.1m property went up to 7.9%, an increase of \u00a318,750. And from April, buyers of second homes and buy-to-let properties face a further 3% stamp duty surcharge. The news sent Berkeley shares down over 2% to \u00a331.85. Others have warned about a bubble at the top end of the London property market that is about to burst. Investment bank Morgan Stanley and investment firm LCP are predicting that prices for luxury flats will fall amid a glut of new-built properties. However, Berkeley remains confident of achieving \u00a32bn of pre-tax profits for the three years to 2017-18, and expects profits this year to be at the top end of forecasts. Analysts have pencilled in \u00a3509m, down from \u00a3540m last year. The group stressed that despite \u201cglobal macro uncertainty, including the impending UK European Referendum, underlying demand has remained strong\u201d. This week it reported progress on plans to build 1,100 homes for private rental as part of a 3,500 home development in partnership with the Greater London Authority in Newham in east London, Berkeley\u2019s biggest rental scheme to date. Shore Capital analyst Robin Hardy said: \u201cIt is clear that Berkeley is repositioning for a very different business profile, buying sites for flats in outer London boroughs and increasingly it would appear more sites for mainstream family housing with sites such as Ascot or Winchester. \u201cWe would still expect the group to have a bias towards the more expensive end of the market, and these locations support that, and good margins can be made but the super-normal margins that London has produced and the very rapid pace of sales is likely to be very hard to repeat.\u201d In another sign that luxury housing schemes are struggling to attract buyers, more than 80 apartments on sale at Battersea Power Station in south-west London have had their asking prices slashed since the start of the year, according to the property firm Propcision. Investors are particularly concerned about the Nine Elms and Battersea area, which is receiving a \u00a315bn revamp, with new towers being built that critics have derided as the \u201cHong Kongification\u201d of London. But analysts at Jefferies said those selling Berkeley shares were picking the wrong stock: \u201cThe main argument of those shorting Berkeley shares is that there is an oversupply of high-value homes \u2013 those with a selling price greater than \u00a32m \u2013 in the Nine Elms and Battersea area \u2026 Our position is that Berkeley is not overly exposed to that particular local market. Across its landbank, the average selling price is \u00a3575,000.\u201d The housebuilder has sold its development of luxury apartments in Nine Elms, Riverlight, and only has one other project in the area. Hardy said: \u201cBerkeley was never likely to get caught out and problems with unsold homes in London is likely to be a problem for newer players who came much later into the London market.\u201d",

Analysts have pencilled in \u00a3509m, down from \u00a3540m last year.</p> <p>The group stressed that despite \u201cglobal macro uncertainty, including the impending UK European Referendum, underlying demand has remained strong\u201d.</p> <p>This week it reported progress on <a href=\"http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/press-releases/2016/new-era-beckons-for-east-end-site\">plans to build 1,100 homes for private rental </a>as part of a 3,500 home development in partnership with the Greater London Authority in Newham in east London, Berkeley\u2019s biggest rental scheme to date.</p> <p>Shore Capital analyst Robin Hardy said: \u201cIt is clear that Berkeley is repositioning for a very different business profile, buying sites for flats in outer London boroughs and increasingly it would appear more sites for mainstream family housing with sites such as Ascot or Winchester. </p> <p>\u201cWe would still expect the group to have a bias towards the more expensive end of the market, and these locations support that, and good margins can be made but the super-normal margins that London has produced and the very rapid pace of sales is likely to be very hard to repeat.\u201d</p> <p>In another sign that luxury housing schemes are struggling to attract buyers, more than 80 apartments on sale at Battersea Power Station in south-west London have had their asking prices slashed since the start of the year, <a href=\"http://propcision.com/blog/battersea.php\">according to the property firm Propcision</a>. </p> <p>Investors are particularly concerned about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/14/battersea-nine-elms-property-development-housing\">Nine Elms and Battersea area, which is receiving a \u00a315bn revamp</a>, with new towers being built that critics have derided as the \u201cHong Kongification\u201d of London.</p> <p>But analysts at Jefferies said those selling Berkeley shares were picking the wrong stock: \u201cThe main argument of those shorting Berkeley shares is that there is an oversupply of high-value homes \u2013 those with a selling price greater than \u00a32m \u2013 in the Nine Elms and Battersea area \u2026 Our position is that Berkeley is not overly exposed to that particular local market. Across its landbank, the average selling price is \u00a3575,000.\u201d</p> <p>The housebuilder has sold its development of luxury apartments in Nine Elms, Riverlight, and only has one other project in the area. Hardy said: \u201cBerkeley was never likely to get caught out and problems with unsold homes in London is likely to be a problem for newer players who came much later into the London market.\u201d</p>",

Strongbow Exploration is set to take over the South Crofty Tin Project, which includes mines in and around the towns of Redruth and Camborne. There has been tin mining in Cornwall since the bronze age. The South Crofty commenced large-scale production in the mid-17th century and shut down in 1998 following a collapse in the price of tin. Several companies have attempted to revive the mines since the turn of the 21st century but Strongbow believes market conditions may now be right for it to work.

    "webTitle": "Billionaire arms deal fixer Wafic Sa\u00efd weighs up Barclays lawsuit", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wafic Sa\u00efd, the billionaire philanthropist and arms deal fixer, is considering legal action against Barclays after the bank forced him to close his personal accounts and those associated with his charities and business ventures. Sa\u00efd, who fled Syria in 1963 to escape a military coup, accused Barclays of using him as a scapegoat to improve its own reputation after being told in December that he was no longer wanted as a customer. PR company Bell Pottinger, run by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s former adviser Lord Bell, issued a statement on his behalf on Friday: \u201cMr Sa\u00efd has been advised by leading counsel to issue proceedings against Barclays.\u201d The claim could be made under the data protection act as the bank would not tell Sa\u00efd the reasons for its concerns. Barclays said: \u201cWe never comment on these matters because of client confidentiality. We treat each case on individual merit.\u201d Sa\u00efd - whose family donates to the Conservative party \u2013 may have to find new bankers for his charity, the Sa\u00efd Foundation, which has its head office close to close to Buckingham Palace and lists Sir Michael Peat, former private secretary to the Prince of Wales, as one of its trustees. The Foundation, according to its website, helps children and young people with disabilities in Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan, and backs the Sa\u00efd business school at Oxford University. The 76-year-old is credited with helping Saudi Arabia buy British weapons in 1985 in the biggest arms deal in history, known as Al-Yamamah. An investigation by the Serious Fraud Office investigation into allegations that BAE had paid bribes to Saudi princes to win lucrative contracts was abandoned at the intervention of the then prime minister Tony Blair. Now based in Paris, Sa\u00efd has moved his personal account, as has his English-born wife, Rosemary, and two children. The statement issued through Bell Pottinger said: \u201cDespite high-level meetings and several requests, formal and informal, Mr Sa\u00efd was given no legal reason or justification for the bank\u2019s action. Indeed they told his representative that if, for example, someone had an address in Brazil the bank would close their accounts. \u201cIt appears that Mr Sa\u00efd and his charities are being used as scapegoats by Barclays to try to improve their own reputation. Mr Sa\u00efd enjoys excellent relationships with a number of leading international banks, none of which has ever expressed concerns regarding the provenance of Mr Sa\u00efd\u2019s funds.\u201d The bank is thought to have been concerned it could not satisfy regulators about its anti-money laundering procedures. Barclays \u2013 which is scrambling to restore its reputation in the wake of fines for rigging Libor and foreign exchange markets \u2013 was last year fined \u00a372m by the Financial Conduct Authority for running the risk of being used to launder money or finance terrorism. Sa\u00efd is \u201ctaking every action possible to ensure his charities are protected and do not suffer financially as a result of Barclays\u2019 actions and he much regrets this irrational and irresponsible behaviour by the bank,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cHis charitable activities, which enjoy the full support of the Charity Commission, donate close to \u00a37m each year to UK and overseas causes,\u201d the statement said. Oxford University said finances of the business school were \u201centirely secure\u201d. No one at the foundation would comment. Regulators have been tightening up their approach to the money laundering rules. Last year, HSBC faced criticism for closing accounts of charities. Its chairman, Douglas Flint, has warned that the risk of fines was making banks risk averse. Asheem Singh, director of public policy at charity leaders group ACEVO, said he would be writing to Barclays. \u201cThe surest way to guarantee fraud or worse terrorist activity is to force humanitarian organisations to carry cash which may be misappropriated by dark forces running riot in areas of conflict and great human need,\u201d said Singh. \u201cBanks may do more harm than good by zealously denying essential financial services. We respect that each case has its own individual circumstance but we will be writing to the head of Barclays bank to seek assurance that such cases are being decided on the basis of rigorous, impartial and unimpeachable protocols and that the moral dilemmas for charities operating in conflict zones are properly understood. The obverse would be damaging for all of us,\u201d Singh added. Oxford University said: \u201cThe [Sa\u00efd] School is an academic department of the University of Oxford and its funding is derived from numerous sources which include research funding and student fees. \u201cThe Sa\u00efd Foundation now provides charitable grants to support a range of initiatives to advance the school\u2019s strategic objectives, including scholarships for students, awards for innovation in teaching, key School events and new approaches to career support for students. We are grateful to the foundation for its support and we look forward to this continuing.\u201d",

An investigation by the Serious Fraud Office investigation into allegations that BAE had paid bribes to Saudi princes to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/21/bae.tonyblair\">win lucrative contracts was abandoned at the intervention of the then prime minister Tony Blair</a>. </p> <p> Now based in Paris, Sa\u00efd has moved his personal account, as has his English-born wife, Rosemary, and two children.</p> <p>The statement issued through Bell Pottinger said: \u201cDespite high-level meetings and several requests, formal and informal, Mr Sa\u00efd was given no legal reason or justification for the bank\u2019s action. Indeed they told his representative that if, for example, someone had an address in Brazil the bank would close their accounts.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt appears that Mr Sa\u00efd and his charities are being used as scapegoats by Barclays to try to improve their own reputation. Mr Sa\u00efd enjoys excellent relationships with a number of leading international banks, none of which has ever expressed concerns regarding the provenance of Mr Sa\u00efd\u2019s funds.\u201d</p> <p>The bank is thought to have been concerned it could not satisfy regulators about its anti-money laundering procedures. Barclays \u2013 which is scrambling to restore its reputation in the wake of fines for rigging Libor and foreign exchange markets \u2013 was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/26/barclays-fined-72m-elephant-deal-fca\">last year fined \u00a372m by the Financial Conduct Authority for running the risk of being used to launder money or finance terrorism</a>. </p> <p>Sa\u00efd is \u201ctaking every action possible to ensure his charities are protected and do not suffer financially as a result of Barclays\u2019 actions and he much regrets this irrational and irresponsible behaviour by the bank,\u201d he said in the statement.</p> <p>\u201cHis charitable activities, which enjoy the full support of the Charity Commission, donate close to \u00a37m each year to UK and overseas causes,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>Oxford University said finances of the business school were \u201centirely secure\u201d. No one at the foundation would comment.<br></p> <p>Regulators have been tightening up their approach to the money laundering rules. Last year, HSBC faced criticism for closing accounts of charities. Its chairman, Douglas Flint, has warned that the risk of fines was making banks risk averse.<br></p> <p>Asheem Singh, director of public policy at charity leaders group ACEVO, said he would be writing to Barclays. \u201cThe surest way to guarantee fraud or worse terrorist activity is to force humanitarian organisations to carry cash which may be misappropriated by dark forces running riot in areas of conflict and great human need,\u201d said Singh.</p> <p>\u201cBanks may do more harm than good by zealously denying essential financial services. We respect that each case has its own individual circumstance but we will be writing to the head of Barclays bank to seek assurance that such cases are being decided on the basis of rigorous, impartial and unimpeachable protocols and that the moral dilemmas for charities operating in conflict zones are properly understood. The obverse would be damaging for all of us,\u201d Singh added.</p> <p>Oxford University said: \u201cThe [Sa\u00efd] School is an academic department of the University of Oxford and its funding is derived from numerous sources which include research funding and student fees.</p> <p>\u201cThe Sa\u00efd Foundation now provides charitable grants to support a range of initiatives to advance the school\u2019s strategic objectives, including scholarships for students, awards for innovation in teaching, key School events and new approaches to career support for students.

The move to replace Flint, who was finance director before becoming chairman in 2010, came as the UK\u2019s biggest bank signalled it was preparing for a new chief executive to take over from Stuart Gulliver. The bank has previously promised investors it will break with tradition and appoint a chairman from external candidates. The prospect of boardroom changes has been in focus since the bank announced last month that it would keep its headquarters in the UK, where it has been based since 1992 after buying Midland bank. Headhunters have been retained by the bank and the process will be led by board members Sam Laidlaw, the former chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, who heads the nominations committee, and Rachel Lomax, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, who is the senior independent non-executive director. Flint and Gulliver are in the middle of a three-year strategy, which will end in 2017, aimed at repairing HSBC\u2019s reputation after a \u00a31.2bn fine imposed by the US authorities for money-laundering, and the scandal exposed by the Guardian and other publications involving the tax affairs of its Swiss banking arm. HSBC is axing 25,000 jobs to help save \u00a33.3bn a year. In the notice sent to shareholders before next month\u2019s annual general meeting, Flint said the nominations committee \u201chad turned its attention to formulating a succession plan for my own role as group chairman, so that the incoming group chairman can lead the process for selecting the next group chief executive in due course\u201d. He added: \u201cThe board aims to nominate my successor during 2017 but the exact timing is dependent upon identifying and securing the appropriate candidate.

So Fresnillo has fallen 23p to 984p while Randgold Resources is down 140p at \u00a365.15, the two biggest declines in the FTSE 100. Egyptian gold miner Centamin has taken the bottom slot in the FTSE 250, down 2.9p at 94.55p. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Solid risk appetite into the end of what has been a busy week for central bank updates, and a US dollar off its dovish Fed-inspired 5-month lows, is seeing gold and silver come off their recovery highs (stronger US dollar makes them more expensive for non-dollar buyers). Overall though the FTSE 100 is up 18.52 points at 6219.64 having earlier reached 6223, close to its high for the year of 6242. Positive moves on Wall Street and in Asia overnight have carried through into Europe. In the wake of the US Federal Reserve cutting back its expectations for interest rate rises, the dollar has weakened and helped support commodity prices, although Brent crude has dipped a little in early trading, down 0.5% at $41.31 a barrel. Also among the fallers is Berkeley, down 62p at \u00a331.95 as the housebuilder said profits would be at the top end of expectations this year but warned housing supply could be hit by planning issues, reducing public sector resources and \u201cone of the world\u2019s highest property taxation regimes.\u201d Elsewhere Sainsburys has slipped 1.6p to 279.9p as it is expected to raise its bid for Argos owner Home Retail, up 1.4p at 182.6p, to as much as \u00a31.5bn by the deadline at the end of the day. Still with retailers, Debenhams has dropped 1.7p to 74.55p as Investec issued a sell note: A new chief executive does not alter the structural challenges Debenhams faces. Sales, margin and cost focused strategies have all be tried and failed to deliver growth. While Debenhams has self-help opportunities (space optimisation; operating efficiencies and mark down), we expect these to be offset by material wage inflation and margin reinvestment back into differentiating the offer. With little profit growth expected over the medium term, we cut to sell (from reduce). Our target price, based on a 35% sector 2017 PE discount, falls to 67p {from 70p]. But Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct International is up 12p at 413.5p, its last day in the FTSE 100 after the recent index reshuffle. But banks are in demand as part of the general recovery, with Standard Chartered up 16.3p at 475.35p on hopes of progress in Asia. It shrugged off a reduce not from Nomura, but the bank\u2019s analysts boosted Royal Bank of Scotland, up 3.5p at 234.4p, and Lloyds Banking Group, up 1.16p at 70.46p.",

In the wake of the US Federal Reserve cutting back its expectations for interest rate rises, the dollar has weakened and helped support commodity prices, although Brent crude has dipped a little in early trading, down 0.5% at $41.31 a barrel.</p> <p>Also among the fallers is <strong>Berkeley</strong>, down 62p at \u00a331.95 as the housebuilder said profits would be at the top end of expectations this year but warned housing supply could be hit by planning issues, reducing public sector resources and \u201cone of the world\u2019s highest property taxation regimes.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Sainsburys </strong>has slipped 1.6p to 279.9p as <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/17/sainsburys-set-to-raise-bid-as-argos-takeover-deadline-approaches\">it is expected to raise its bid</a></strong> for Argos owner <strong>Home Retail,</strong> up 1.4p at 182.6p, to as much as \u00a31.5bn by the deadline at the end of the day.</p> <p>Still with retailers, <strong>Debenhams</strong> has dropped 1.7p to 74.55p as Investec issued a sell note:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A new chief executive does not alter the structural challenges Debenhams faces. Sales, margin and cost focused strategies have all be tried and failed to deliver growth. While Debenhams has self-help opportunities (space optimisation; operating efficiencies and mark down), we expect these to be offset by material wage inflation and margin reinvestment back into differentiating the offer. With little profit growth expected over the medium term, we cut to sell (from reduce). Our target price, based on a 35% sector 2017 PE discount, falls to 67p {from 70p]. </p> </blockquote> <p>But Mike Ashley\u2019s <strong>Sports Direct International </strong>is up 12p at 413.5p, its last day in the FTSE 100 after the recent index reshuffle.</p> <p>But banks are in demand as part of the general recovery, with <strong>Standard Chartered </strong>up 16.3p at 475.35p on hopes of progress in Asia. It shrugged off a reduce not from Nomura, but the bank\u2019s analysts boosted <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong>, up 3.5p at 234.4p, and <strong>Lloyds Banking Group,</strong> up 1.16p at 70.46p.</p>",
