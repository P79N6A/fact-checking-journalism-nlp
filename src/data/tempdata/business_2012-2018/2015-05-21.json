      "bodyText": "The number of young adults able to buy homes could fall nearly 50% within five years unless the government addresses the housing shortage, a report has claimed. Over the past decade, home ownership among 25-34-year-olds has dropped by a third, from 1.8m to 1.2m, and analysis by the housing charity Shelter published on Friday suggests that if current trends continue, the number of young homeowners will drop to about 616,600 by the end of this parliament. This would mean that less than 20% in that age group would have made it on to the property ladder, compared with nearly 60% a decade ago. In recent years, soaring house prices and problems with getting mortgages have pushed more young households into the private rented sector. In 2004, just over 675,000 people aged 25-34 were tenants. However, by 2014, the number was 1.6m. As home ownership becomes increasingly difficult, Shelter said the number of renters could rise to 2.3m by 2020. In addition, it said, a \u201cclipped-wing generation\u201d of young adults living with their parents had emerged. The report followed government figures showing that the number of new homes built last year remained well below the level needed to meet demand. A total of 125,110 homes were built in England in 2014-15, up from 112,400 the previous year, but this is half the rate some experts say is needed. Those stuck in rented accommodation have seen rents rise by 4.6% over the past year, according to figures from letting agents Your Move and Reeds Rains. The increase, the fastest recorded by the index since November 2010, pushed the average rent in England and Wales to a new high of \u00a3774 a month. In London, the average was up 7.8% year-on-year at \u00a31,204. For homeowners and buyers, however, the mortgage price war is continuing to push rates down to record lows, with one leading lender unveiling the UK\u2019s cheapest two-year fixed-rate home loan, priced at 1.07%. The new loan, from Yorkshire building society, trumps a 1.09% deal launched by Co-operative Bank earlier this month. However, the Yorkshire\u2019s mortgage has a \u00a31,369 product fee and is available only to customers able to stump up a hefty 35% deposit. Rachel Springall, a spokeswoman for the financial data website Moneyfacts.co.uk, said the new home loan was \u201cthe lowest ever fixed mortgage on record\u201d, adding: \u201cWith the rate war ongoing, this is the perfect time for borrowers to secure a low fixed rate.\u201d Mike Regnier, Yorkshire building society\u2019s chief commercial officer, said: \u201cWe are a responsible mutual lender which uses its financial strength to support its members rather than external shareholders. This means we can offer our members very competitive rates in order to enable them to buy the home of their choice.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s spokesman adds that Merkel, Hollande and Tsipras agreed to stay in close contact, and also agreed that Greece should keep negotiating with her creditors. So, friendly negotiations, but no indication of a major breakthrough... One more development.... there are reports that Alexis Tsipras will meet Jean-Claude Juncker on Friday, after the EU summit. A late newsflash from Riga -- a German government spokesman has said tonight\u2019s talks centred on finding a successful completion to the current Greek aid programme, which runs out at the end of June. The meeting between Tsipras, Merkel and Hollande lasted more than two hours. The trio didn\u2019t speak to reporters as they left, alas. The French government has kindly provided some photos too. Here\u2019s an official photo of tonight\u2019s talks: The New York stock market just hit a new closing high, suggesting Wall Street remains unperturbed by events in the eurozone. The eagerly awaited meeting between the leaders of Germany, France and Greece is getting underway. Even though this photo is blurry, you can make out Angela Merkel\u2019s jacket.... European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has arrived, straight from a visit to the Middle East to discuss issues including a two-state solution for Palestine. A quick recap: EU leaders have arrived in Riga for a two-day summit on Eastern European partnership, but with Greece\u2019s debt crisis looming over them. Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande and Alexis Tsipras will hold informal talks tonight, after a working dinner taking place now. Sources have told us that a new four-month Greek bailout extension will be discussed. One said: \u201cA very senior German official speaking in the most measured of ways and with a great deal of forethought described this as a possible outcome that was now very seriously being discussed,\u201d \u201cIt would be entirely logical. If it doesn\u2019t happen we\u2019re looking at a scenario like Cyprus with capital controls and banks closed....as close as you can get to euro exit.\u201d. Francois Hollande has fuelled the optimism tonight, saying that the three-way talks could help reach a deal. Hollande said: With Tsipras we want to find solutions to restore confidence and release the funds that have been planned,\u201d \u201cSo it will be a friendly talk, but a talk in which we have to be able to draft solutions.\u201d But there are also reports that Greece\u2019s optimism is not shared by its creditors, and that progress still needs to be made on issues such as pensions, labour market reform and VAT rates. Alexis Tsipras certainly looked happy when he arrived at tonight\u2019s working dinner -- I guess travelling in a military transport jet must be quite invigorating.... France\u2019s president has suggested tonight that talks between Alexis Tsipras, Angela Merkel and himself could help reach a deal. Bloomberg has the details: French President Francois Hollande opened the prospect of striking a political deal with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that unlocks bailout aid for Greece within days. Speaking before a summit of European Union leaders in Riga, Latvia, Hollande said that a meeting he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold with Tsipras later on Thursday will help pave the way for an accord to be hammered out by finance ministers at the end of May or early June. \u201cWith Tsipras we want to find solutions to restore confidence and release the funds that have been planned,\u201d Hollande told reporters. \u201cSo it will be a friendly talk, but a talk in which we have to be able to draft solutions.\u201d Interesting rumour, that would make sense if a compromise is being hammered out in the days ahead... Is Greece\u2019s government, once again, too optimistic about a deal? Greek journalist Giannis Papageorgiou is hearing as much: Council president Donald Turk arrived in a \u2018let\u2019s get down to business\u2019 mood: France\u2019s president is here.... ...although he didn\u2019t look as cheery as his Italian counterpart. German chancellor Angela Merkel has arrived for the working dinner, followed by that informal meeting with Alexis Tsipras. The Riga Summit, says European Council president Donald Tusk, is an opportunity for the EU to build stronger ties with the countries to its East, and to reiterate its opposition to conflict in the region: We\u2019re used to seeing Alexis Tsipras travel in economy class - but today he switched to a military flight to reach Riga. No frills for Mr Tsipras - but at least he got plenty of legroom. More arrivals. And Ukraine\u2019s President Petro Poroshenko (left) got a warm-looking welcome from Latvia\u2019s president, Andris Berzins. As we covered earlier, leaders will be discussing how to end conflict in the region, such as the military action in Eastern Ukraine. Ahead of tonight\u2019s summit in Riga, European markets moved higher - just - amid uncertainty whether or not Greece would be offered a bailout extension. Eurozone data earlier was mixed, while UK retail sales were better than expected - which boosted the pound - while US confidence and housing figures were disappointing. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 6.21 points or 0.09% higher at 7013.47 Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.14% at 11,864.59 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.26% better at 5146.70 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.18% at 11,595.4 The Athens market added 0.63% to 845.73 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was an exception, down 0.14% at 23,739.69 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 12 points or 0.07% higher. And they\u2019re starting to arrive in Riga for tonight\u2019s summit: The disappointing eurozone consumer confidence figures may not be as disappointing as all that, say analysts. Howard Archer at IHS Economics said: Eurozone consumer confidence eased back for a second month running in May. This follows on from the purchasing managers reporting that overall manufacturing and services expansion slowed for a second month running (and at a slightly faster rate) in May according to the purchasing managers. This will likely fuel concern that the eurozone\u2019s recovery is starting to flag as the recent stimulus it has received is diluted by a recent firming in the euro, oil prices and bond yields from very low levels. However, it needs to be borne in mind that while eurozone consumer confidence dipped for a second month in May, it was nevertheless at its third highest level since August 2007 and well above its long-term norm. The May/April drops should also be seen in the context that Eurozone consumer confidence index had seen substantial overall improvement over the four months through to March. Teunis Brosens at ING Bank said: In this afternoon\u2019s instalment of the ongoing run of disappointing eurozone data, we bring you consumer sentiment. According to a flash estimate of consumer confidence by the European Commission, sentiment fell to -5.5 in May. Gains made in the previous two months have now been erased. The further deterioration in sentiment is probably partly explained by the fact that rising oil prices are felt at the pump: average \u20ac95 fuel prices reached \u20ac1.49 in May, up 4 cents from April and 17 cents from January lows. Financial market turmoil may also have hurt confidence. But even after this correction, eurozone consumers remain upbeat, with sentiment still well above its long term average of -12.5. This leaves scope for retail sales to rebound after their disappointing setback in March. Consumer confidence conveys essentially the same message as this morning\u2019s PMI-numbers: sentiment among both businesses and consumers is no longer ecstatic, but still quite good. Barring a Greek accident, the economic outlook for the Eurozone remains brighter than it has ever been in recent years, with scope for further gains in both consumption and business investment. In the US, the latest figures have also come in below forecasts: Perhaps this is no surprise, with increasing talk about a Greek default and exit from the euro, but eurozone consumer confidence came in much worse than expected this month. The confidence index fell to -5.5 from -4.6 the previous month, and analysts forecasts of -4.8. The European Central Bank believes its QE bond buying programme is working as it intended, according to the minutes of its last meeting released earlier, and concerns about the scarcity of supply of suitable bonds were exaggerated. Carsten Brzeski on ING Bank sums up the bank\u2019s comments: The just released minutes of the ECB, officially known as the account of the last ECB meeting, did not provide any new crucial information. In fact, the minutes confirmed the ECB\u2019s positive stance on economic developments, while at the same time stressing that all positivity was conditional on the full implementation of QE. The minutes also showed that permanent inner conflict the ECB is fighting with. On the one hand, the ECB acknowledges and sometimes celebrates the positive impact from QE, while on the other hand it keeps on hammering on the need for structural reforms. In the minutes, quite some time was dedicated on the fact that \u201ca strong signal needed to be sent to euro-area governments urging them to press ahead with structural reforms and to take measures to improve the business environment\u201d. A tricky balancing act as the positive impact from QE could clearly reduce reform efforts. The minutes did not show any tapering debate within the Governing Council. However, the minutes at least reflected the start of the debate on QE flexibility which reached its climax earlier this week. According to the ECB, scarcity concerns about the supply of government bonds were exaggerated. Moreover, the ECB already discussed flexibility of QE, according to the minutes. All in all, there are at least three important take-aways from the ECB minutes: tapering was not discussed, the positive economic outlook was conditional on the full implementation of QE and the ECB will concentrate on inflation trends, not on single inflation data points. Altogether a strong confirmation of the ECB\u2019s determination to continue with QE, not half-heartedly but with full conviction. Of course, it was what happened at the press conference after the meeting which attracted a lot of the attention: The Guardian has learned that a four-month extension of Greece\u2019s current bailout is on the table, and will probably be discussed by Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras tonight. And despite Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s caution, the idea of giving Greece some leeway to draw up reforms is apparently being \u201cvery seriously\u201d considered. Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens, reports: Well-placed German officials with intimate knowledge of the state of negotiations \u2013 and the various scenarios on offer \u2013 are saying the prospect of Athens being given \u201ca four-month breather\u201d that would allow it to drum up a detailed list of reforms is now being studied seriously. Moreover, it is likely to be the focus of tonight\u2019s meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras her Greek counterpart. One insider revealed: \u201cA very senior German official speaking in the most measured of ways and with a great deal of forethought described this as a possible outcome that was now very seriously being discussed,\u201d \u201cIt would be entirely logical. If it doesn\u2019t happen we\u2019re looking at a scenario like Cyprus with capital controls and banks closed....as close as you can get to euro exit.\u201d. With Greece\u2019s debt repayment schedule being so heavy this year \u2013 it owes \u20ac6.2bn to the ECB in July and August alone \u2013 2015 offers the one window of opportunity to force Tsipras\u2019 hand. In exchange for tiding the debt-stricken country over, Tsipras\u2019s anti-austerity government would have to produce a compelling and comprehensive package that would persuade creditors Athens was finally determined to get down to the business of reform. Our source says: \u201cThe big challenge is that it doesn\u2019t look like a repetition of the extension we had in February. It would have to look a lot different because it is that solution that got us to where we are today. There\u2019s only one point in creating a financial bridge like this and that is if the European side genuinely believes it will lead to reform.\u201d But experts are saying after four months of seemingly stalled negotiations the gap-stop solution makes eminent sense - not least because it gives the leftist-led government enough time to either hold a referendum or call fresh elections, polls that the governing Syriza party would almost certainly win hands down. Both scenarios would allow Tsipras to deal with militants in his party and move to the centre stage offering clarity to a political landscape blighted by Syriza\u2019s two seemingly incompatible aims: to ensure Greece stays in the euro zone while at the same time eradicating austerity. \u201cThis scenario makes sense because it would provide sufficient time for Greece to hold a referendum or election both of which would ease Syriza\u2019s position,\u201d said Kevin Featherstone, who heads the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s the one scenario that brings the two of them [Merkel and Tsipras] together and I have no doubt they will be talking about it [tonight].\u201d. In many ways the solution would also be a bonanza for Europe\u2019s first anti-austerity leader because it would offer him the chance to emerge as the leader of the entire centre left. The alternative is a place in the history books as the prime minister that oversaw Greece\u2019s crash out of the euro and the chaos that would inevitably ensue. \u201cIt depends on who he [Tsipras] wants to be,\u201d said professor Featherstone. \u201cHe still has to make the choice between staying in the euro zone and enforcing the necessary concessions or alleviating the suffering from austerity and leaving the euro zone.\u201d Any deal would almost certainly acknowledge his government\u2019s desire to alleviate social hardship, Featherstone added. \u201cIn all likelihood it will have fewer reforms and allow Tsipras to claim that he tried his best.\u201d As we wrote this morning, Eurasia Group also predicts that a deal will be reached next month But there\u2019s no doubt that Tsipras is under pressure from his radical faction. Earlier today MEP Manolis Glezos, a legendary figure for leftists, called on Greeks to take to the streets and described both the EU and IMF as \u201csadistic\u201d. \u201cNow is the time to show that we have kept the ideology of resistance,\u201d said the 92-year-old, who shot to fame tearing down the Swastika from the Acropolis during Greece\u2019s brutal German occupation, adding: \u201cWe owe it to the generations that are coming to pour onto the streets to prove to the profiteers that we have no more blood to give \u2026 and to say to our government that we are with it as long as it doesn\u2019t take a step back. Now is the time to show to all that we have preserved the memory of freedom.\u201d Journalist are already arriving in the Latvian capital: The Eastern Partnership summit in Riga is due to kick off at 8pm local time (6pm BST) with an informal working dinner at the House of the Blackheads. The official welcoming ceremonies begin tomorrow at 9am (7am BST). Discussions will then take place on building closer ties between the EU and Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. Press conferences are then scheduled from 1.45pm, or 11.45am BST. So Friday could be a busy morning, with Greece\u2019s bailout talks and Britain\u2019s attempts to renegotiate its EU membership also looming over the event. Germany\u2019s finance minister has cautioned that a Greek breakthrough is not imminent. In an interview just published with Reuters, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble stuck to his position that progress between officials from Greece and its creditors remains slow. Sch\u00e4uble argued: \u201cWhat I know from discussions with the three institutions does not back up the optimism arising from announcements from Athens. There is not yet any substance to the mere announcement that we are closer to an agreement. This is still within the realms of atmosphere.\u201d The interview took place yesterday; a time when Greek spokesmen were warning that the country would miss its next repayment to the IMF, on June 5, without a deal. Asked if Greece could default, Sch\u00e4uble warned \u201cI can\u2019t rule anything out in any case.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy chart showing how Greece could reach a deal -- and all the different ways it could go wrong: The European Commission has refused to comment on last night\u2019s report that a bailout extension is being worked on. Our focus is to conclude the current review as fast as possible, it says. Mujtaba Rahman, practice head at Eurasia Group, has predicted that Greece and her creditors will reach a short-term deal by early next month. In a new research note, Rahman suggests that officials will hammer out a short-term financing deal to cover Greece\u2019s immediate needs. We remain of the view a short term financing deal that avoids these risks is likely. This will now probably happen in the first week of June. Moreover, we think this agreement will not fundamentally jeopardise the integrity of the governing coalition. This will be more likely, though not inevitable, in the context of a third bailout which could be subject to a referendum in September/October. A Staff-Level Agreement would allow the European Central Bank to raise the limit on how much Greek government debt its banks can own -- a crucial source of short-term funding. If a deal is reached, Alexis Tsipras would face a rebellion from the more hard-line members of his party. But Rahman believes that Syriza hold back from mass defections. Critically, we think it unlikely Tsipras will lose his parliamentary majority (meaning the number of defections will be less than 12 MP\u2019s). Our belief is substantiated by the latest polls, which once again show Greek voters\u2019 growing dissatisfaction with the negotiating strategy of the government. Table settings are being shuffled in Riga.... Angela Merkel has addressed the German parliament this morning, before heading to Latvia for the EU summit tonight. The Riga meeting is officially called the Eastern Partnership summit, and will include discussions on conflict resolution in the region. Merkel geared up this by telling MPs in the Bundestag that Russia\u2019s involvement in eastern Ukraine was unacceptable. The chancellor said: We see the G7 as a community of values. And that means working together for freedom, democracy, and for the rule of law. That means respecting the laws of nations and the territorial integrity of nations.\u201d Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine are not compatible with that. A return to the G8 format is not imaginable as long as Russia doesn\u2019t act according to those basic values.\u201d Shares are inching higher on the Athens stock market this mornings, on hopes that Alexis Tsipras can make some progress in his talks with Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande tonight. The main Athens index is up 0.5% this morning, outperforming the rest of Europe. The French and German markets are both down, after this morning\u2019s PMI data showed a slowdown in Germany and another contraction in the French factory sector. Brenda Kelly, head analyst at London Capital Group, says European investors have been digesting the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting, published on Wednesday evening. \u2018Last night\u2019s Fed minutes all but ruled out a rate hike in June owing to the weakness of first quarterly growth and the lack of inflation. More recent weak macro data from the US would also imply that even this set of minutes is out-of-date and the market is now pricing in rate hike for early 2016. No surprises were to be found within the minutes. US investment management giant BlackRock remains pretty confident that Greece and her creditors will reach a deal in time: The jump in UK retail sales suggests Britain\u2019s drop into negative inflation last month is not the start of a deflationary spiral: UK retail sales have just smashed forecasts, sending the pound jumping. Sales were up by 4.7% year-on-year in April, jumping by 1.2% month-on-month. It was driven by more demand for clothes, textiles and footwear - suggesting shoppers were lured into buying summer outfits by the warm weather last month. The news sent sterling is up almost 1% against the US dollar, to $1.5623. The ONS also reported that average store prices (including petrol stations) fell for the 10th consecutive month, down 3.2% compared with April 2014. So as prices drop, people buy more stuff, as Mario Draghi once put it. Dr Nick Spiro, managing director at Spiro Sovereign Strategy, is concerned by today\u2019s PMI surveys from the Big Two European nations: It\u2019s bad enough that France is struggling to recover, but even more concerning that Germany\u2019s economy continues to slow - and fairly significantly at that, with the composite PMI falling from 54.1 to 52.8. Although still expanding, growth in the services and manufacturing sectors has lost considerable momentum. This suggests that economic weakness in the first quarter of this year has extended deep into the second. Back in the UK, Tesco has suggested that it could potentially claw back the seven-figure payment handed to its former CEO, Phil Clarke. Tesco\u2019s annual report, released this morning, contained this snippet: On termination of employment, in accordance with the terms of his contract, Philip Clarke was entitled to receive a termination payment of \u00a31,217,000... Should it be determined in the future that there was gross misconduct the Company will seek recovery of the termination payment. Shortly after Clarke left, Tesco shocked the City by admitting it had overstated profits due to mis-accounting the way it dealt with suppliers, prompting the suspension of several senior staff. More on fastFT: Europe\u2019s jobs crisis may finally be easing. Firms are hiring staff at the fastest pace since 2011, the early days of the eurocrisis, according to Markit\u2019s PMI survey. Germany and France are now being outpaced by the rest of the eurozone, according to Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck of the region. Companies across the euro periphery are enjoying their best quarter since the credit crunch struck the global economy, with job creation and growth surging. But they were dragged back by the \u2018core\u2019 countries of Germany and France (as covered earlier in the blog). That pulled the overall Flash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index down to a three month low of 53.4, down from 53.9 in April. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the eurozone\u2019s recovery lost some of its vigour in May, with growth slowing slightly for a second successive month. \u201cThe survey results suggest the German economy is on course for a reasonable expansion of 0.4% in the second quarter, but France is likely to struggle to see growth exceed 0.3%. However, it\u2019s outside of these two \u2018core\u2019 countries where the main action appears to be, with the rest of the region enjoying its best quarter of economic growth and job creation for almost eight years.\u201d Greek PM Alexis Tsipras will meet with Francois Hollande in Riga tonight as well as Angela Merkel, in an attempt to reach a political solution to the crisis. That\u2019s via the Kathimerini newspaper, which adds: Tsipras is hoping that his meeting with Merkel and Hollande will result in some kind of political gesture that will help the pace and direction of deliberations with the institutions. The Greek leader is expected to tell his counterparts that his government has made as many concessions as it can and that the lenders now have to find a way to move closer to Greece. Sources said the premier will stress that the agreement will have to show that there has been a change in Greece\u2019s policy mix. Growth across Germany\u2019s companies has slowed to a five-month low, adding to concerns that Europe\u2019s largest member is coming off the boil. The German Composite Output Index calculated by Markit has fallen to 52.8, down from 54.1 in April. Firms reported weak demand, and rising cost pressures. And export orders grew at the slowest rate in three months. This suggests that Germany\u2019s economic growth may not pick up significantly this quarter, after slowing to just 0.3% in the first quaeter. Oliver Kolodseike, Economist at Markit, says: \u201cWhile the survey data are consistent with further GDP growth heading into the middle of the year, it looks as if this rate of expansion of the German economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead. \uf0a7 France\u2019s economy is strengthening this month, although its factories are still finding conditions quite tough. That\u2019s the verdict from Markit\u2019s latest assessment of the eurozone\u2019 second largest economy. Its Flash France Composite Output Index rose to 51.0, up from 50.6, showing growth picking up [50 is the cut-off point between expansion and contraction]. Firms reported a rise in new business, and in job creation. \uf0a7Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, explains: \u201cThe French private sector posted further modest output growth in May, suggesting that economic expansion is being maintained through the second quarter. The service sector remained the driver of growth, offsetting another contraction in manufacturing.\u201d The two-day Riga summit which begins tonight is also David Cameron\u2019s first meeting with fellow leaders since winning the general election. He\u2019ll be pushing his campaign to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of the EU, before an in-out vote in 2016 or 2017. According to The Times, Cameron also wants Europe to stop referring to the euro as the single currency(!) He wants a new legally binding commitment that recognises that Europe is home to multiple currencies, removing the implicit assumption that all EU members will eventually join the euro. One source said: The British have asked the EU to accept an architecture that demonstrably shows the UK is never heading to the same destination and has a different category of membership, otherwise the UK will end up outside the EU. More here: Drop the term \u2018single currency\u2019 or we\u2019re out, Cameron tells EU (\u00a3) Is the eurozone considering throwing Greece a lifeline by extending its existing bailout over the summer? German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung claimed last night that EU policymakers are considering extending the existing programme until the autumn. Under the plan, Athens would get almost \u20ac4bn of aid in return for reforming its VAT system, but could delay modernising its labour market and pension system until the autumn. Here\u2019s the story: EU erw\u00e4gt Verl\u00e4ngerung der Griechenland-Hilfe We\u2019ve not had any official confirmation, or denial yet - but I suspect it\u2019s only a matter of hours. Such a plan would be consistent with the Muddle-Through strategy that has prevailed through the crisis: One immediate problem - \u20ac4bn isn\u2019t enough to cover Greece\u2019s repayments to the ECB this summer, which add up to around \u20ac6.7bn Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With time running short for Greece, could a meeting of European leaders in Riga tonight provide the spark for a deal with creditors and avert default? Greek PM Alexis Tsipras will meet with German chancellor Angela Merkel, after dinner, on the sidelines of the EU summit in the Latvian capital which begins tonight. And Athens insiders hope the discussion might help to break the deadlock that threatens to leave Greece perilously short of funds to meet \u20ac1.5bn of IMF repayments in June. Greek spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides told us last night that: \u201cWe know that decisive decisions ultimately are taken at the level of finance ministers in the Eurogroup but at this critical moment a meeting between Tsipras and Merkel can only be helpful.\u201d The two leaders will discuss Greece\u2019s liquidity crisis \u2013 last night, the European Central Bank agreed to provide another \u20ac200m of emergency help. Greece and her lenders are still divided over three key issues; VAT rates, pension payments, and deregulating the labour market. Tsipras\u2019s task is to persuade fellow leaders that Greece must break with austerity. As Sakellarides put it: \u201cThe persistence of the architects of this regime and their insistence of keeping the country on the same track, is simply irrational. We want to stop the vicious cycle of debt and recession. Its not about stubbornness. Its about preserving Greece and its people.\u201d Last night, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis warned that Greece would choose to pay pensions rather than repaying the IMF, if it ran out of funds next month. Also coming up today.... Flash estimates for private sector growth in France, Germany and the eurozone are released this morning, between 8am and 9am BST. That will show whether the Greek crisis is hitting demand and business confidence. Then its UK Retail Sales data at 9.30am BST: a weak performance might fuel concerns over consumer confidence And Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to dip again, as the Greek crisis looms: Here\u2019s the opening calls: FTSE 7004 -3 points DAX 11830 -18 CAC 5124 -9 IBEX 11524 -50 MIB 23715 -58 We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

Howard Archer at IHS Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Eurozone consumer confidence eased back for a second month running in May.<strong> </strong>This follows on from the purchasing managers reporting that overall manufacturing and services expansion slowed for a second month running (and at a slightly faster rate) in May according to the purchasing managers.</p> <p>This will likely fuel concern that the eurozone\u2019s recovery is starting to flag as the recent stimulus it has received is diluted by a recent firming in the euro, oil prices and bond yields from very low levels.</p> <p>However, it needs to be borne in mind that while eurozone consumer confidence dipped for a second month in May, it was nevertheless at its third highest level since August 2007 and well above its long-term norm. The May/April drops should also be seen in the context that Eurozone consumer confidence index had seen substantial overall improvement over the four months through to March.</p> </blockquote> <p>Teunis Brosens at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this afternoon\u2019s instalment of the ongoing run of disappointing eurozone data, we bring you consumer sentiment. According to a flash estimate of consumer confidence by the European Commission, sentiment fell to -5.5 in May. Gains made in the previous two months have now been erased. The further deterioration in sentiment is probably partly explained by the fact that rising oil prices are felt at the pump: average \u20ac95 fuel prices reached \u20ac1.49 in May, up 4 cents from April and 17 cents from January lows.

On the one hand, the ECB acknowledges and sometimes celebrates the positive impact from QE, while on the other hand it keeps on hammering on the need for structural reforms.</p> <p>In the minutes, quite some time was dedicated on the fact that \u201ca strong signal needed to be sent to euro-area governments urging them to press ahead with structural reforms and to take measures to improve the business environment\u201d. A tricky balancing act as the positive impact from QE could clearly reduce reform efforts.</p> <p>The minutes did not show any tapering debate within the Governing Council. However, the minutes at least reflected the start of the debate on QE flexibility which reached its climax earlier this week. According to the ECB, scarcity concerns about the supply of government bonds were exaggerated. Moreover, the ECB already discussed flexibility of QE, according to the minutes.</p> <p>All in all, there are at least three important take-aways from the ECB minutes: tapering was not discussed, the positive economic outlook was conditional on the full implementation of QE and the ECB will concentrate on inflation trends, not on single inflation data points. Altogether a strong confirmation of the ECB\u2019s determination to continue with QE, not half-heartedly but with full conviction.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/15/ecb-protest-woman-interrupts-mario-draghi-speech\"><strong>what happened at the press conference after the meeting </strong></a>which attracted a lot of the attention:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9638771e96ba990cea2a7ca8825c05cef271386c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432216256675/57d999be-8cce-48f7-a512-7c3ea4941086-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Protester disrupts ECB press conference after its monthly meeting.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protester disrupts ECB press conference after its monthly meeting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DANIEL ROLAND/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-555dd939e4b0271ee97487f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-21T13:25:21.828Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Insiders: Greek bailout extension to be discussed in Riga</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Guardian has learned that a four-month extension of Greece\u2019s current bailout is on the table, and will probably be discussed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/may/21/germany-greece-bailout-summit-tsipras-merkel-live#block-555d6fe6e4b0c4f5ce819309\">Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras tonight</a>.</strong></p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/may/21/germany-greece-bailout-summit-tsipras-merkel-live#block-555dc6dde4b08ac403af46a1\">despite Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s caution</a>, the idea of giving Greece some leeway to draw up reforms is apparently being \u201cvery seriously\u201d considered. </p> <h2>Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens, reports: </h2> <p>Well-placed German officials with intimate knowledge of the state of negotiations \u2013 and the various scenarios on offer \u2013 are saying the prospect of Athens being given \u201ca four-month breather\u201d that would allow it to drum up a detailed list of reforms is now being studied seriously.</p> <p>Moreover, it is likely to be the focus of tonight\u2019s meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras her Greek counterpart.</p> <p>One insider revealed:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cA very senior German official speaking in the most measured of ways and with a great deal of forethought described this as a possible outcome that was now very seriously being discussed,\u201d </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt would be entirely logical.

      "bodyText": "The new private consortium that recently won the \u00a34.2bn management contract for the decommissioning of 12 Magnox nuclear power stations has revealed plans to cut up to 1,600 jobs. Cavendish Nuclear, a division of Babcock International, plus its US partner Fluor, said the cuts reflected \u201cplanned stepdowns in the work programme\u201d at a number of atomic sites around the UK. The move comes amid speculation that Babcock is preparing to demand millions of pounds of extra subsidies from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) on the grounds that the workload was much heavier than anticipated. Unions expressed shock that staff, agency and contract workers would lose their jobs between now and September 2016, although the Cavendish Fluor Partnership said it would try to find some alternative posts. Eleven of the plants have already shut down and the remaining one in operation \u2013 Wylfa on Anglesey in North Wales \u2013 is due to stop generating power at the end of the year. Industry experts said other plants were getting to the end of defuelling and other activities that had required staffing to be increased. \u201cThese proposed reductions arise from planned stepdowns in the work programme at a number of sites and the implementation of a more streamlined operating model for delivering decommissioning,\u201d said the consortium in a statement. \u201cWe will seek wherever possible for these reductions to be through voluntary means and we will endeavour to retrain staff in roles where we are currently reliant on agency resources.\u201d Gary Smith, national secretary for energy at the GMB union, which has about 600 members at Magnox, told Sky News: \u201cSome of these job losses have been planned for quite some time. Others will come as a shock, particularly for the workforce employed on temporary contracts. We\u2019re pleased that the first tranche of job losses will be on voluntary basis. But this will be a tough time for a lot of Magnox workers.\u201d The NDA said it was confident that the contract would deliver savings for the taxpayer of around \u00a31bn compared with the previous plan over the full 14-year period and \u201cwell above the competition\u2019s original target to secure 10% off the baseline costs\u201d. The Cavendish Fluor Partnership won the contract to manage the 12 Magnox sites last September in a bitter battle against the incumbent, Energy Solutions. When it lost out, Energy Solutions launched a legal challenge. Problems with the decommissioning of the separate Sellafield site in Cumbria have recently led to the private consortium there which includes Amec and Areva of France \u2013 being thrown off the management contract. The 12 nuclear power sites managed by the Cavendish consortium for Magnox include Berkeley, Gloucestershire; Bradwell, Essex; and Hinkley Point A in Somerset. EDF last month announced plans to cut 400 construction jobs at the site of the planned new atomic plant of Hinkley Point C. The reduction in workers comes amid continuing delays over a final investment decision on the \u00a324.5bn project as negotiations with potential investors continue to move more slowly than expected.",

That\u2019s no time at all \u2013 about half the average business cycle \u2013 and it introduces a lottery-style element. Rossi has been making the case for five-year holding periods for ages. Indeed, for the last couple of years, Fidelity, with \u00a3190bn under management, has been voting against the remuneration reports of companies that do not practise five years. As he says, he seems to be winning the argument. Two years ago, only four FTSE 100 companies complied; last year\u2019s figure was 27; now the tally is 42. So why haven\u2019t other fund managers joined a campaign that appears to be succeeding and is definitely not fuelled by outrage over inflation in boardroom pay? Rossi, note, is limp on the quantum of executive pay. That\u2019s not his fight. He\u2019s interested in better \u201cgovernance and structure\u201d for share incentives. The answer, one suspects, is that many fund managers elsewhere feel gagged because their overlords on the group board haven\u2019t adopted five-year periods themselves. Only two FTSE 100 fund management houses make Rossi\u2019s list of compliant companies: Standard Life and (new this year) Aviva. The firms that should hang their heads in shame are: Aberdeen Asset Management, Legal &amp; General, Old Mutual, M&amp;G-owner Prudential and Schroders. If they won\u2019t shift, progress will be slower than it should be. Cashback at Tesco There\u2019s a revelation in Tesco\u2019s remuneration report \u2013 and it\u2019s not the \u00a31.2m pay-off for former chief executive Philip Clarke, nor even his \u00a313.7m pension pot. It\u2019s the fact that, in Tesco\u2019s calamitous year, Clarke and his colleagues met a few of their performance targets. Naturally, the pay committee was obliged to award no bonuses. But the relevant table reveals that bonuses, if calculated \u201con a formulaic approach\u201d, could have appeared at 28% of maximum. Clarke &amp; co, you see, missed their profit and sales targets by a country mile but they cleared a few \u201cstrategic/non-financial\u201d hurdles. Internet orders were a hit. And \u201ccolleague engagement\u201d was a satisfactory 66.5%, though this can\u2019t have been hard to achieve: the shopfloor was surely as engaged as the rest of us by Tesco\u2019s meltdown. As for CO2 reduction, wonders were performed: the \u201cstretch\u201d target was 38% but 41% was delivered. It could serve as an epitaph for Tesco\u2019s year: it was good at hot air. The more serious news within the pay report is that Tesco has been sufficiently shocked by the events to change directors\u2019 contracts. From now on, clawback provisions will apply to cash bonuses and share awards. If profits are \u201cmaterially misstated\u201d or an individual has \u201ccontributed to serious reputational damage,\u201d and so on, the company will want some or all of the money to be returned. That is a stronger clause than will apply to Clarke, where Tesco will merely seek the recovery of the \u00a31.2m termination payment \u201cshould it be determined in the future that there was gross misconduct\u201d. Such determination will have to wait until the end of legal process, currently stuck with the Serious Fraud Office inquiry. Clawback provisions are not perfect. Companies can\u2019t simply apply absolute discretion; legal challenges are possible, indeed likely. But contractual clauses permitting clawback strengthen a company\u2019s hand. Banks have been forced to adopt them. Others should too \u2013 and not wait for disaster to strike. Royal Mail delivers Still got those Royal Mail shares? You should feel reasonably relaxed, even at 500p versus the 330p float price. Chief executive Moya Greene is accurate in describing the trading environment as \u201cchallenging\u201d but Royal Mail is putting up decent resistance. Revenues were virtually flat last year but most of the various measures of profitability (there are several) moved in the right direction. The best yardstick is perhaps operating profits after \u201ctransformation\u201d costs, which showed a 5% increase to \u00a3595m, a tribute to the group\u2019s new ability to control costs. Amazon\u2019s decision to deliver its own parcels added capacity to an already over-supplied market. But Royal Mail still managed a 1% increase in parcel revenues. In letters, the likely departure of Whistl\u2019s posties removes one long-term headache. Add it all up and Royal Mail should be able to keep churning out \u00a3450m of cash a year, in which case the dividend (up 5%) is solid. George Osborne may still wish to bank the state\u2019s remaining 30% stake. But he shouldn\u2019t feel a need to rush.",

The companies obtained contracts of up to 15 years in the December auction to provide extra electricity-generating capacity from 2018 on the basis that they would use existing generation or be building new sites. \u201cOfgem has opened investigations to see if five generators provided false or misleading information to National Grid about planning consents for some of their proposed generating units that took part in the December 2014 capacity auction,\u201d the regulator said in a statement. \u201cThe opening of these investigations does not imply that we have made any findings about non-compliance,\u201d Ofgem said of the review, which centres on whether planning consents were obtained. Green Frog declined to comment, while Alkane Energy said it \u201cdoes not believe it is in breach of the Capacity Market Rules and will fully cooperate with Ofgem\u2019s investigation.\u201d Power Balancing Service could not be contacted. The move came as the National Grid warned that the gap between expected power demand and supply would remain \u201cvery, very tight\u201d \u2013 particularly during the winter after next. Steve Holliday, the chief executive of the National Grid, expressed renewed concerns 24 hours after SSE announced plans to close the 1,000 megawatt power station at Ferrybridge in West Yorkshire next year. SSE\u2019s move was not a total surprise, he said, but it \u201cabsolutely does\u201d point up the fact that old coal-fired and nuclear generating capacity was being taken off the system while not enough new generation was being built. Holliday was speaking as the Grid reported an 11% increase in adjusted pretax profits to \u00a32.9bn and said return on equity from the UK regulated business had averaged 13.7%. He said the latter high figure \u2013 compared to 8.4% for the US business \u2013 was not to the detriment of energy customers because the Grid was bound to share the benefits with power users under the terms of its agreements with Ofgem. Holliday said the company was using innovation and new technology to drive down the cost of its business, saying robotics, for example, would reduce the number of holes it dug in the ground by 50% between 2013 and 2018. The Grid boss said that further cost-savings to energy users would come from new contracts to import power via interconnector pipelines with mainline Europe. He stressed that being part of the wider European energy market was \u201cessential for the UK\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has introduced provisions to claw back bonuses from chief executive Dave Lewis and finance director Alan Stewart if financial results are misstated or the executives were to damage the company\u2019s reputation. The clawback provision, which will apply for up to five years, comes after Tesco was forced to pay more than \u00a32m to its former chief executive and finance director who were ousted before last year\u2019s \u00a3263m accounting scandal came to light. The misstatement of profits linked to supplier payments is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council. Philip Clarke, Tesco\u2019s former chief executive, who oversaw a difficult period marked by a series of profit warnings, was paid \u00a31.2m for loss of office. The former finance director Laurie McIlwee collected \u00a3970,880. Tesco, which tried but failed to withhold the payments while it carried out an investigation into the accounting scandal, said it would seek to recover the payments if either was found to have been guilty of gross misconduct. \u201cWe have explicitly reserved the company\u2019s rights to pursue recovery of these payments,\u201d the retailer said in its annual report published on Thursday. Lewis, who was paid a total of \u00a34.13m for his first six months in the job including a \u00a33.23m \u201cgolden hello\u201d, is in line to earn up to \u00a37.8m this year, including \u00a36.5m in cash and share bonuses if he hits performance targets. But Tesco said its new clawback provision would \u201censure the company is able to take back awards in the event that results are materially misstated or the participant has contributed to serious reputational damage\u201d. It said awards could also be scaled back if the company, one of its business units, or executives\u2019 conduct was linked to serious misconduct or fraud. Tesco said it would take back annual cash bonuses for a period of up to three years after they were handed out, while long term share bonuses would remain subject to clawback for up to five years. Last year, Lewis missed out on a bonus after the company failed to hit profit targets. In the annual report, Tesco said that, based on performance targets, Lewis should have been awarded an annual bonus worth nearly \u00a3400,000 and Stewart \u00a3187,000. Neither received the payout after Tesco\u2019s remuneration committee \u201cdetermined that a satisfactory level of profit had not been achieved\u201d. Nevertheless Lewis, who joined Tesco from Unilever in September last year, earned \u00a3810,000 in basic salary, pension and benefits for six months\u2019 work \u2013 including \u00a315,000 worth of security arrangements at his home \u2013 plus the \u00a33.23m \u201cgolden hello\u201d that included \u00a3525,000 in cash and \u00a32.8m in Tesco shares to compensate him for share awards forfeited when he left his former employer. Stewart, who joined at the end of September, earned \u00a32.3m including \u00a3413,000 in basic salary, pension payments and benefits, including \u00a321,000 in security measures. But his total payout amounted to \u00a32.3m after a \u00a31.9m \u201cgolden hello\u201d in compensation for share awards lost when he left Marks &amp; Spencer. Half of Stewart\u2019s and Lewis\u2019s annual bonuses for this year will be based on sales performance with 30% based on profit performance and 20% on individual targets. Deanna Oppenheimer, the new chair of Tesco\u2019s remuneration committee, consulted shareholders on the change from the company\u2019s previous setup, which was more focused on profits. Some commentators have blamed the focus on profit above more long-term goals for Tesco\u2019s troubles. Oppenheimer said she would be meeting shareholders again this year to further review Tesco\u2019s pay strategy, although she said she did not anticipate further changes. Tesco\u2019s move to protect itself from enforced payouts to executives came as the annual report said any legal action resulting from the SFO investigation or from a group of US shareholders who are suing over the accounting scandal \u201ccould have a material and adverse impact on the group\u2019s financial condition\u201d. Last month, Tesco revealed it had crashed to the biggest loss ever recorded on the UK high street, slumping \u00a36.4bn into the red after huge writedowns on the value of its property portfolio and stock. Tesco has closed stores, laid off thousands of staff and completely shaken up its management team as Lewis tries to revive the fortunes of the UK\u2019s largest retailer.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s new chief executive said he was \u201cproud\u201d of the wages the fast food giant pays its employees on Thursday as thousands of McDonald\u2019s workers and union activists descended on the company\u2019s headquarters near Chicago to hold the biggest ever protest against \u201cpoverty wages\u201d. About 3,000 McDonald\u2019s employees from across the US chanted: \u201cWe work, we sweat, put $15 in our cheque\u201d as they marched towards the burger giant\u2019s headquarters holding banners reading \u201cMcDonald\u2019s: $15 and Union Rights, Not Food Stamps.\u201d As the meeting began, protesters delivered a petition signed by 1.4m people calling on the company to support a $15 minimum wage and to respect workers\u2019 rights to unionize. \u201cWe\u2019re here to tell McDonald\u2019s and its shareholders to invest in the company and its workers instead of wealthy hedge fund managers and executives,\u201d said Kwanza Brooks, a McDonald\u2019s worker and mother of three from Charlotte, North Carolina, who is paid $7.25 an hour. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of relying on food stamps to feed our own families. We need $15 and the right to form a union and we need it now.\u201d Protesting workers were allowed through a police barricade to deliver the petition but complained that they were prevented by security guards from taking it to the actual McDonald\u2019s meeting. A McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cThe protesters gave the petition to McDonald\u2019s representatives who respectfully accepted it.\u201d Terrence Wise, 35, travelled 12 hours by bus from Kansas City with his three young daughters. \u201cWas it worth it to stand here? Yes, definitely. I want my voice to be heard. I\u2019ve worked at McDonald\u2019s and Burger King for 11 years earning $8 an hour. I have three little girls to care for. I work two jobs, my partner works too, yet we still struggle to survive. We rely on food stamps. I don\u2019t want to live on food stamps, I want to get paid what I deserve and work hard for. McDonald\u2019s can clearly afford to pay us a living wage. They need to, now.\u201d McDonald\u2019s dismissed the demonstrations as a publicity campaign by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which is working to organize workers across the fast-food industry. \u201cThe union has spent its members\u2019 dues money in the past two years attacking the McDonald\u2019s brand...in an unsuccessful attempt to unionize workers,\u201d the company said in a statement. Earlier this year, McDonald\u2019s announced it would raise pay for workers at company-owned restaurants to $1 above the local minimum wage. Company-owned stores account for only about 10% of McDonald\u2019s. In the meeting, Steve Easterbrook, the newly appointed chief executive officer, said he was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of the move and said the company was not responsible for the wage decisions of its franchisees. \u201cWe voluntarily took leadership,\u201d he said. Following a series of sales declines there were clear signs that investors want management changes. Shareholders forced through a vote to make it easier for them to nominate new directors. The company had opposed the vote, backed by the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (Calpers) and the New York City Pension. That vote came after a Guardian analysis of McDonald\u2019s board showed how insular the company has become. The average tenure of McDonald\u2019s governance committee, which is responsible for appointing new directors, is 17 years. Ten of McDonald\u2019s 13 non-executive directors are from the Chicago business community. Keandra Guilmant, 25, from Minnesota, said: \u201cI can\u2019t raise my little boy on the $8 an hour I make. We are a two-person earning family, yet we still have to rely on government assistance. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that they [McDonald\u2019s executives] are walking around there [the company\u2019s headquarters] in Armani shoes, when I can\u2019t afford any shoes. I want Versace heels.\u201d Many of the protesters arrived on Wednesday for the rally outside McDonald\u2019s headquarters in Oak Brook, a suburb about 20 miles west of Chicago. On stage, Adriana Alvarez, one of 101 McDonald\u2019s workers arrested for protesting at the meeting last year, said: \u201cWe\u2019re here to make it clear to McDonald\u2019s that we want $15 and union rights. We don\u2019t need food stamps, and we definitely don\u2019t want buybacks [in which the company buys its own shares to benefit shareholders].\u201d Alvarez, who has worked at McDonald\u2019s for five years, said she is paid so little that she needs food stamps and Medicaid to care for her three-year-old son, Manny. The company, which has taken the highly unusual step of banning the media from the meeting, on Wednesday closed many of its corporate offices and its on-site restaurant and removed \u201cGolden Arches\u201d flags from its properties. Mary Kay Henry, president of the SEIU, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for McDonald\u2019s to respect the workers on the frontlines as much as they have respected shareholders by putting $30bn in their pockets over the last 10 years.\u201d As well as pressure on the streets outside, McDonald\u2019s faced some tough questions from its shareholders, angry at the company\u2019s failure to keep up with the changing tastes of consumers. Easterbrook was quizzed about the role of Ronald McDonald and the company\u2019s marketing to children. \u201cWhat sort of modern, progressive company sends a clown to schools,\u201d asked shareholder and blogger Leah Segedie. Easterbrook defended the company mascot. \u201cRonald is here to stay,\u201d he said. He said Ronald McDonald was feeling \u201ctrendier and even more confident\u201d after a recent makeover.",

      "bodyText": "Qinetiq, the defence technology group whose military equipment includes bomb detection robots, has jumped nearly 8% after a positive update. The company - spun out of the Ministry of Defence in 2002 - reported a 7% rise in full year profits to a better than expected \u00a3107.8m, helped by a good performance from its services business in Europe, the middle east and Africa. It is \u00a3128m of the way through a \u00a3150m share buyback but this may be reviewed when it ends in late summer, with analysts suggesting there was scope for it to be extended. But the company was cautious about the outlook, especially for the UK defence industry with the prospect of further austerity measures now the Conservatives have won the general election. Even so, its shares are up 17.1p to 232.3p, helped by news that JP Morgan Cazenove had upgraded from neutral to overweight, pointing to an attractive free cash flow and dividend yield. Investec analyst Rami Myerson said: Qinetiq reported a good set of 2015 results... Cash generation was impressive and net cash of \u00a3195.5m is better than our forecasts for \u00a3182m. New chief executive Steve Wadey joins a company that is healthy operationally with a strong balance sheet. We, and the broader investor community, are keen to understand the strategy for the next stage in Qinetiq\u2019s evolution. Liberum said: As most exposed to UK defence, the shares rallied post the Conservative victory and now trade on a 2015 PE of 14.3 times, dividend per share yield of 2.9% and free cash flow yield of 5.4%. The buyback provides technical support and the shares should respond well to today\u2019s results. Responding badly to results was Dairy Crest, down 35p at 483p after the company reported a 59% fall in full year profits to \u00a322.1m and said it expected growth in the current year to be weighted to the second half. It has been hit by falling sales by its key supermarket customers and a fall in milk prices. The company expects to complete the sale of its dairies business once regulatory approval is received, leaving it predominantly a branded business including its Cathedral City cheddar. Jefferies analysts said: We note that the underlying losses in dairies were greater than anticipated, but the divestment of this business is likely to be approved eventually, in our view, and investors should rather focus on the business that will be retained. Net debt is slightly higher than anticipated due to exceptionals.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s shoppers have taken advantage of the spring sunshine and stocked up on shorts and sandals early, which has contributed to the strongest growth in April clothing sales for more than five years. Retail sales data from the Office for National Statistics, published on Thursday, showed the volume of clothing and footwear sales was 8.7% higher than the same month a year earlier. It reported: \u201cFeedback from retailers suggests that the warmer than average weather resulted in an increase in the quantity bought as consumers brought forward the purchase of summer clothes.\u201d Overall retail sales were also better than expected, rising by 4.7% year on year. It was an increase of 1.2% on the figure for March. Average selling prices declined for the 10th consecutive month, by 3.2%, as the supermarket price war continued and the cost of petrol fell further. The total amount spent in the shops, at \u00a327.8bn, was exactly the same as April 2014 \u2013 but falling prices meant shoppers got more for their money. City analysts said the strong figures suggested consumers were spending again after a long-awaited rise in living standards. With pay growing at 1.7%, according to the latest figures, and inflation below zero in April, real wages have finally started to climb. Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at the payments company World First, said: \u201cThe man in the street is finally starting to see wages increase in real terms and the stagnancy in inflation is allowing him to go out and shop.\u201d He said the jump in clothes sales was \u201ca likely reaction to a week or so of good weather in April or shoppers buying their shorts and flip-flops before a cheap week in Europe through the Easter holidays\u201d. However, Chris Williamson, the chief economist at the data provider Markit, said continued strong growth in consumer spending, coupled with rising inflation \u2013 which is expected in the coming months as oil prices increase \u2013 could push the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy sooner than expected. He said: \u201cWith retail sales numbers as strong as these seen in April, rate hikes later this year are certainly a growing possibility.\u201d The Bank\u2019s quarterly inflation report, published last week, suggested the first interest rate rise would not come until mid-2016.",

      "bodyText": "A surge in self-employment and temporary or part-time jobs over the past two decades has been a key factor behind the rise in inequality in the world\u2019s industrialised countries, according to a major new study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Paris-based club, which has been a driving force in arguing that increasing inequality jeopardises economic growth, says more than half of all job creation in its 34 member countries since the mid-1990s has been in \u201cnon-standard work\u201d, which accounts for about a third of total employment. With such jobs tending to be lower-paid and less secure than their full-time, permanent equivalents, some economists have described this phenomenon as the rise of a \u201cprecariat\u201d \u2013 and the OECD says the growing prevalence of non-standard work has widened wage inequality. \u201cNon-standard workers are worse off in terms of many aspects of job quality. They tend to receive less training and, in addition, those on temporary contracts have more job strain and have less job security than workers in standard jobs. Earnings levels are also lower in terms of annual and hourly wages,\u201d the OECD says. \u201cIn the six years since the global economic crisis, standard jobs were destroyed while part-time employment continued to increase,\u201d it says, in the new report, In It Together: Why Less Inequality Benefits All, the latest in a series on inequality. In general, inequality has tended to rise across OECD countries in recent decades. The report says that the richest 10% of the population now earn 9.6 times the income of the poorest 10%, up from 7 times in the 1980s \u2013 and the shift to non-standard work has played a role. Temporary staff in particular tend to suffer a \u201cwage penalty\u201d relative to their permanent colleagues, the OECD finds. \u201cCompared with permanent workers, temporary workers face substantial wage penalties, earnings instability and slower wage growth.\u201d TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cWe cannot build a secure recovery off the back of zero-hours contracts and weaker employment rights. If we don\u2019t create more decent jobs inequality will continue to soar and the economy risks running out of steam. \u201cThe hire and fire culture of recent years has allowed unscrupulous employers to hold down pay and make staff survive off scraps of work.\u201d In the UK, where the growing use of zero-hours contracts was an issue during the UK\u2019s recent general election campaign, the OECD finds that non-standard work has accounted for all the net jobs growth since 1995. The OECD also debunks the idea that non-standard work is always a short-term stopgap, while employees wait for a permanent role to come along. \u201cNon-standard work is not always a stepping stone to stable employment. Temporary contracts increase the chances of acquiring a standard job compared with remaining unemployed, but a part-time job or self-employment does not increase the chances of a transition to a standard job. The process of replacing permanent, full-time staff with non-standard work has contributed to the polarisation of today\u2019s workforce, between highly-skilled, well-paid jobs and lower-paid, low-skilled ones, the OECD finds \u2013 a process some experts have blamed on technological change. \u201cSince nearly all job losses, regardless of the type of task, were associated with regular work, while growth in employment took place mainly in the form of non-standard employment, technological advancement alone cannot be the only explanation for job polarisation. Labour market institutions and policies have also probably played a role,\u201d it says. The OECD calls for government action to improve the prospects of lower-skilled workers in the labour market: \u201cThe focus must be on policies for quantity and quality of jobs; jobs that offer career and investment possibilities; jobs that are stepping stones rather than dead ends.\u201d It also calls for governments to adopt a series of other policies to tackle inequality and mitigate its impact, including encouraging women to enter the workforce, using the tax system to redistribute income towards the poorest families, and improving education.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "<p>Senators have proposed a scheme that allows single-income earners to reduce their tax, but it would work against efforts to improve workforce participation</p>", 
      "body": "<p>One of the responses to the budget has been for some senators to question the lack of support for stay-at-home mothers. They argue that not only should proposed cuts to family tax benefit B in last year\u2019s budget be reversed, but that a policy of income splitting is introduced that would allow single-income-earners to reduce their tax. </p> <p>Such a scheme, however, would inevitably benefit those on higher incomes, and would work directly against efforts to improve the workforce participation of women.</p> <p>This month\u2019s budget included <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2015-16/content/overview/html/overview-30.htm\">tables</a> that compared the amount of tax paid with benefits received by households. One aspect the tables show is that budget measures will mean dual-income families are better off compared with single-income families.</p> <p>The tables feature 12 types of family, but include only two where the household income and family size are comparable.</p> <p>It presents two households with $80,000 annual income and three dependent children. One household has one income earner; the other has one parent earning 70% of the income ($56,000) and the other 30% ($24,000).</p> <p>After paying tax and receiving government benefits the single-income household has a disposable income of $85,497, compared with $93,559 for the 70:30 household:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/QbeC4/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The main reason for the difference is the amount of tax paid. While the 70:30 household receives $589 more in government benefits, it pays $7,473 less in tax. </p> <p>This can be explained by the amount of individual income tax, where the first $18,200 earned is tax-free. There is also a \u201clow income tax offset\u201d which raises the tax-free threshold to $20,542.

Income splitting involves the main income earner splitting some income off and giving it to their partner for tax purposes. </p> <p>For example, if you allowed full income splitting, a person earning $100,000 would file a tax return in which both they and their partner earned $50,000. </p> <p>As this not only puts them in a lower bracket but also has both taking advantage of the tax-free threshold, their tax bill would be significantly lower.</p> <p>A household on $100,000 with one earner pays (excluding the Medicare levy) $24,947 in tax for an average tax rate of 24.5%.

      "bodyText": "One of the responses to the budget has been for some senators to question the lack of support for stay-at-home mothers. They argue that not only should proposed cuts to family tax benefit B in last year\u2019s budget be reversed, but that a policy of income splitting is introduced that would allow single-income-earners to reduce their tax. Such a scheme, however, would inevitably benefit those on higher incomes, and would work directly against efforts to improve the workforce participation of women. This month\u2019s budget included tables that compared the amount of tax paid with benefits received by households. One aspect the tables show is that budget measures will mean dual-income families are better off compared with single-income families. The tables feature 12 types of family, but include only two where the household income and family size are comparable. It presents two households with $80,000 annual income and three dependent children. One household has one income earner; the other has one parent earning 70% of the income ($56,000) and the other 30% ($24,000). After paying tax and receiving government benefits the single-income household has a disposable income of $85,497, compared with $93,559 for the 70:30 household: The main reason for the difference is the amount of tax paid. While the 70:30 household receives $589 more in government benefits, it pays $7,473 less in tax. This can be explained by the amount of individual income tax, where the first $18,200 earned is tax-free. There is also a \u201clow income tax offset\u201d which raises the tax-free threshold to $20,542. And if you have two earners, both receive the tax-free threshold.
