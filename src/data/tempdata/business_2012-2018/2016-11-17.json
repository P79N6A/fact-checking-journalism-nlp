      "bodyText": "Labor has signalled its support for the concept of a much larger trade agreement than the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Turnbull government has sent similar signals after the election of Donald Trump, given the likely failure of the TPP. A new consensus is emerging in Canberra in the lead-up to a meeting this weekend of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group in Peru. The trade minister, Steve Ciobo, is already at the Apec summit, and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, left for Peru on Thursday night. Ciobo travelled to the meeting prepared to talk seriously to China about a relatively unknown trade deal, called the Free Trade Area of Asia Pacific, which is being advanced by the Chinese government. The FTAAP would involve 21 countries, making it much larger than the 12-country TPP. One widely cited study estimates the gains from FTAAP would be eight times that of the TPP \u2013 close to $2tn, or roughly 2% of world gross domestic product in 2025. In an opinion piece published by the Australian Financial Review on Thursday, and in an interview with the Financial Times before the Apec summit, Ciobo said he wanted to conclude a collective study on the FTAAP. \u201cWith the future of the TPP looking grim, my ministerial counterparts and I will work to conclude a study on the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, which sets out agreed actions towards a future free trade zone,\u201d he wrote. He also said Australia had \u201clong been a supporter\u201d of the FTAAP concept. Now Jason Clare, the shadow minister for trade and investment, has told Guardian Australia that the FTAAP concept is a good one, particularly because it would include the United States and China. He said with the demise of the TPP Australia ought to focus on other trade opportunities. \u201cI don\u2019t think FTAAP is going to be finalised quickly. It\u2019s a big project that will take time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it does have the advantage over all other proposed regional trade agreements in that it includes both China and the United States.\u201d He said trade was an area of relative bipartisanship in Australia between Labor and the Coalition, and he saw the potential in FTAAP. But he said a lesson from the election of Donald Trump, and from Brexit, was that a lot of people were \u201cpretty angry, don\u2019t trust politicians, and feel like they\u2019re no better off today than they were a decade ago or worse\u201d, so political parties ought to listen. \u201cThe Labor party understands how important trade is in improving the lives of Australians, but it\u2019s not just about trade,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about domestic reforms \u2013 like the minimum wage, negative gearing, education, skills reforms \u2013 a whole lot of things that need to be done in Australia if we\u2019re going to reverse the trend of increasing inequality, and the trends that we\u2019re seeing here and in the US and the UK of lower standards of living. \u201cTrade is part of something bigger, which is inclusive growth.\u201d Ciobo said on Friday that, besides the TPP and the FTAAP, a third potential Asia-Pacific trade deal had great potential. \u201cI\u2019m pursuing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or what\u2019s called RCEP, with a view to what\u2019s going to be good for Australia,\u201d he told ABC radio. \u201cIt has the potential, given it\u2019s more than 50% of the global population, more than 30% of global GDP ... that if we are able to successfully land it over the coming months and year or so ahead, would create terrific opportunities for Australian businesses to export through a common set of rules across the region.\u201d The RCEP agreement involves 16 countries, including China, but it excludes the US. The Chinese government has long seen RCEP as an alternative to the US-driven TPP. Clare told Guardian Australia that the key to security and prosperity in the Asia Pacific was to have the US and China getting along. \u201cA trade agreement that involves both of them is very important,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got trade agreements that exclude one of them, that creates the risk that the other feels contained or isolated or excluded. If they\u2019re both in an agreement, at the core of it, it helps to further enmesh those two economies.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of jobs may be lost in Somerset after GKN said it would close a plant that makes helicopter components at the end of next year. The company makes airframes \u2013 the body of an aircraft excluding its engines \u2013 for Royal Navy helicopters at the site in Yeovil. It began formal consultations with unions last month after Leonardo, which assembles the Wildcat helicopter in the town, told GKN it planned to take production back in-house. Leonardo is owned by Italy\u2019s Finmeccanica, which bought Westland \u2013 Britain\u2019s only helicopter business \u2013 from GKN in 2004 for \u00a31bn. At the time the Yeovil plant employed 4,000 people. After Leonardo made the decision earlier this year to take all future AW159 Wildcat helicopter work in-house, GKN said in October that its Yeovil operation was no longer a viable business. It then began a consultation period based on two options: either significantly downsizing the facility or closing it entirely. \u201cSince then, we have explored all possible options to avoid closure. However, we have found no realistic chance of significant, long-term helicopter work in the foreseeable future, and we have been unable to find a solution that would make GKN Yeovil a sustainable business,\u201d a GKN spokesman said. The company said that failure meant it was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d to work on the basis that the site would close at the end of 2017. \u201cConsultation with nominated employee representatives will continue, now focused on the appropriate steps towards closure in 13 months\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery effort will be made to support people throughout this difficult period and, wherever possible, GKN will seek to offer alternative jobs to employees at other UK sites.\u201d Both GKN and Leonardo workers are located on the same site in Yeovil. Unite\u2019s regional secretary for the south-west, Peter Hughes, said it was dreadful news for the 221 workers at GKN Yeovil and their families in the run-up to Christmas. \u201cIt is a hammer blow for the Somerset economy in particular and for UK manufacturing more generally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reinforces the urgent need for ministers to formulate a coherent industrial strategy to safeguard UK manufacturing.\u201d Hughes added: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that the business case for closure has been made and in the weeks ahead we will exploring options to keep the plant going as a viable business. \u201cWe will be giving our members maximum support at this difficult time and talking to GKN about redeployment within this key British business.\u201d Earlier this week the union accused GKN of \u201csupercilious behaviour\u201d in its treatment of the Yeovil workforce and of \u201cthrowing these highly skilled manufacturing jobs on to the funeral pyre of corporate greed\u201d. As well as its aerospace business, GKN has three other main divisions including land systems, which makes components such as gearboxes for earthmoving equipment. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a member of the FTSE 100, valued at almost \u00a35.3bn. The company employs about 55,000 people in more than 30 countries. Leonardo is the largest inward investor in the UK defence sector and one of the biggest suppliers of defence equipment to the Ministry of Defence. The company employs 7,300 people at six sites across the UK, two-thirds of whom have highly skilled roles.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Philip Hammond, should limit the impact of the Brexit vote on the economy by excluding public investment spending from his deficit reduction plans in his autumn statement next week, economists say. As the Treasury finalised tax and spending plans, economists warned that a black hole in government finances of more than \u00a3100bn could deter the chancellor from boosting infrastructure spending and leave the economy to cope with severe headwinds without extra support. The chancellor is expected, in the autumn statement next Wednesday, to admit that Britain\u2019s public finances have suffered their biggest fall since 2011. The official forecast will show that the UK faces an extra deficit bill of between \u00a350bn and \u00a3114bn over the next four years. A cocktail of slowing growth, stagnant wages and lower than expected investment next year will shred forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in March, forcing the government to increase its borrowing just to maintain current spending. Hammond has hinted that he will reverse some cuts in public investment, due to take effect from next April, to fund \u201coven-ready\u201d infrastructure projects and maintenance. He is also under pressure from Theresa May, the prime minister, to find the money for tax cuts to support what officials in Whitehall call Jams, or families who are \u201cjust about managing\u201d. He could also partly reverse cuts to universal credit scheduled to bite from next April. In the summer Labour pledged if it gained power to mobilise \u00a3500bn of investment and lending to create a new national investment bank to help the UK economy recover post-Brexit, with \u00a3350bn coming directly from the public purse. But Hammond has ruled out a mini-budget of expensive giveaways and a splurge on road, rail and energy schemes as he seeks to restrict the impact of a downturn on public finances. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the chancellor should separate public investment spending from the day-to-day departmental budgets and welfare spending, to free up a \u00a317bn war chest to boost skills training and infrastructure projects. Simon Kirby, head of macroeconomics at the National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research, said the Treasury could boost spending next year while retaining some firepower to cope with a worse than expected shock to the economy. Analysis by the Resolution Foundation forecast that the Treasury would need to borrow an extra \u00a384bn by 2019/20 to fill the gap left by lower tax receipts and higher spending commitments on pensions and other uncapped benefits. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the \u00a310.4bn surplus pencilled in for 2019-20 by the OBR was now on course to be a \u00a314.9bn deficit, leaving a \u00a325bn gap to fill during the government\u2019s last year in office. An average of economic forecasts that included those made by City institutions was even gloomier. In a document published by the Treasury, the expected deficit in 2019/20 was \u00a341bn, producing a \u00a350bn funding gap in that year. The OBR has drawn up forecasts that will be presented next week alongside the autumn statement, which is expected to reflect the sharp deterioration in the outlook for next year and subsequent years. Most forecasters believe GDP growth will fall to about 1.2% as inflation heads towards 3% and wages remain stuck at a growth rate of 2.5%. Consumer spending has driven the majority of the UK\u2019s growth in recent years and a sharp rise in inflation is expected to hit disposable incomes and slow down economic activity.",

Ed Balls, Strictly speaking, isn\u2019t a politician these days. But the former shadow chancellor knows a thing or two about such matters, having been an architect of the Bank of England\u2019s independence in 1997, and his nuanced take puts the crude populism of the likes of Michael Gove and William Hague to shame. Unlike them, Balls acknowledges the bleedin\u2019 obvious: that the Bank did a decent job of preventing the post-banking crisis recession turning into a depression. That record is why, incidentally, the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, is entitled to grumble about politicians engaging in a \u201cmassive blame-deflection exercise\u201d. Monetary activism was endorsed by the government of the day. If politicians don\u2019t like the \u201cbad side effects\u201d, as Theresa May calls them, of low interest rates, they are allowed to take off-setting measures. They use taxation to address inequality; or they could do pension funds a favour by addressing the distortions caused by the mad system for calculating deficits. But Balls is correct to say that the Bank has accumulated massive powers since the crisis and that its actions now routinely take it into territory traditionally regarded as political. Only this week, for example, Threadneedle Street gained the right, more or less, to close down the buy-to-let lending market if it spies risks in the system. That notion would have been regarded as far-fetched back in 1997. It flowed from George Osborne\u2019s action in 2010 to return full responsibility for financial stability to the Bank. Theadneedle Street, arguably, is now more powerful than at any time in its 300-year history. Has political accountability kept pace? Probably not, which is Balls\u2019 point. His big idea is that an extra layer of oversight is required \u2013 \u201ca systemic risk body chaired by the chancellor\u201d to oversee the whole system. The fine details probably require some work but the idea is worth debating: the Bank would still have operational independence to set interest rates but the government would keep a closer eye on the mandate. A useful side effect might be an end to the sillier Bank-bashing. Hague, for example, jumped straight from his dislike of low interest rates to issuing an apocalyptic warning that unless central banks changed course \u201cthe era of their much-vaunted independence will come, possibly quite dramatically, to its end\u201d. Let\u2019s hope not: central bank independence has served the UK well. But there is a fair argument that independence is best protected by ensuring the Bank\u2019s enormous powers have greater checks and balances. Give Balls\u2019 idea 7 out of 10: needs more polish, but an engaging contribution. EDF\u2019s home troubles don\u2019t instil confidence In EDF we trust, said the government in effect when it gave a thumbs-up to Hinkley Point C, the nuclear plant that will supposedly one day supply 7% of our electricity. But have ministers had a look at the current chaos in EDF\u2019s home market of France? EDF has issued two profit warnings in three months, prompted by an order by the French nuclear safety regulator that tests be conducted on 18 of the company\u2019s 58 reactors. Some of those reactors have returned to service but not enough for EDF to meet its output targets. Thus French power prices have soared. Power has even been flowing to France from the UK through the giant interconnector at times. The direction, set by where wholesale prices are higher, is normally the other way. That is one reason why the UK wholesale price of electricity for this winter is massively higher than the forward price for next winter \u2013 about \u00a380 a megawatt hour versus \u00a350. There is no reason to doubt National Grid\u2019s assurance that supplies are sufficient for this winter, but the price signal is unmistakable: the market is nervous. As Peter Atherton of energy consultant Cornwall explains it, the UK system is traditionally designed to cope with eight or nine things going wrong simultaneously, but three or four might be tricky today. \u201cWe are now seeing a significant risk premium in the wholesale price as reserve margins have got tighter,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened in the past but it is happening now.\u201d Not all the blame for the spike in UK wholesale prices can be laid at EDF\u2019s door. And maybe all its French reactors will be signed off as safe in the new year. But one worry about Hinkley is more acute than ever: EDF looks over-stretched at home and in no position to attempt a big UK adventure.",

But one worry about Hinkley is more acute than ever: EDF looks over-stretched at home and in no position to attempt a big UK adventure.</p>",

The costs associated with moving the clearing of complex financial instruments to another financial centre means London is likely to remain the home of the \u00a3460tn-a-year business, S&amp;P said. There have been warnings that as many as 100,000 City jobs would be axed if London lost its euro-clearing role, which rival European financial centres were eyeing up jealously even before the result of the 23 June referendum. An estimated 70% of the transactions using the European single currency are processed in London by clearing houses, which step in between major banks and financial firms on big deals to guarantee transactions. The European Central Bank has argued this business should be conducted in the eurozone. Last year, however, the Treasury declared victory over the central bank after a European court concluded the ECB did not have the right to make such a demand.

At this stage, however, we see neither of these options as likely. This is for several reasons, notably the massive extra burden of margin collateral that it could place on market participants,\u201d S&amp;P said. Clearing houses require collateral to be used as a deposit when they are handling trades so extra demands for collateral would push up the cost of doing business from $83bn to $160bn at the London Clearing House, according to an estimate by financial data company ClarusFT cited by S&amp;P.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco chief warns brands not to make UK shoppers pay for weak pound", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Tesco has fired a fresh warning shot at multinational consumer brand owners, such as Marmite\u2019s parent company Unilever, by asking them not to push currency-related price hikes on to British shoppers. In his first comments since last month\u2019s \u201cMarmitegate\u201d stand-off, Dave Lewis said consumers should not be asked to pay \u201cinflated prices\u201d due to fluctuations in currencies, such as the post-referendum slump in the pound. \u201cI spent 28 years working in a multinational and there are always elements of currency volatility in businesses like that,\u201d said Lewis, who joined Tesco from Unilever two years ago. \u201cWhen there is devaluation, what multinationals do is they present sales at constant and current exchange rates and the City understands. \u201cThe only thing we would ask is that companies in that position don\u2019t ask UK customers to pay inflated prices in order that their reporting currency is maintained. They don\u2019t do that to countries outside of the UK.\u201d The Marmite dispute resulted in gaps on Tesco\u2019s shelves after the UK\u2019s largest supermarket chain refused to accept price increases of about 10% on household brands ranging from Marmite to Persil and Flora in order to accommodate the falling price of sterling. The stand-off was resolved quickly, although neither side has disclosed the terms of the peace deal. Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive Mike Coupe has also argued that major suppliers should take the hit resulting from the falling value of the pound, as many were far more profitable than the retailers they served. Since the Brexit vote, suppliers have been demanding higher prices, with Birds Eye fish fingers and Walkers crisps among the high-profile examples. Lewis said it was a multinational\u2019s right to try to push through a price increase but it was also Tesco\u2019s right to say \u201cwe will no longer stock them if they do so without a justified reason\u201d. Tesco was not \u201cnaive\u201d to inflationary pressures in the marketplace, Lewis said, but with a large commodities team sourcing ingredients for its own brand food business, it had a lot of insight with which to negotiate supplier deals. \u201cWhere a cost is real and justified, we will sit down [with a supplier] and discuss how we can offset it,\u201d he said. Official figures this week fanned fears that the weak pound was raising costs for British businesses and would soon be felt by consumers. The price of materials and fuels for manufacturers rose 12.2% in the year to October 2016, the biggest increase for five years. There were also signs they had started to pass some of those higher costs to customers as factory gate prices rose 2.1% on the year, the biggest increase for more than four years. Lewis said Tesco was already seeing inflation in certain categories, singling out pork, with the currency impact being felt \u201ccommodity by commodity, product by product\u201d. After five years of declines, Tesco has started to win back market share in the UK as shoppers respond to price cuts and investment in customer service. According to the most recent data from Kantar Worldpanel, sales rose by 2.2% in the 12 weeks to 6 November, up from 1.3% reported last month, making it the only one of the big four chains to record growth. Lewis is leading the turnaround of the grocer, which faced the biggest crisis in its history in 2014 when a whistleblower alerted him to an accounting scandal that revealed profits had been artificially inflated. Following a Serious Fraud Office investigation, three former Tesco executives will face trial on fraud charges next year. His comments came as Tesco\u2019s senior management briefed reporters from its new headquarters in Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire on its three-year plan to rebuild profits. In the wake of the accounting scandal, Lewis closed its previous head office in nearby Cheshunt in favour of the new campus, where buildings have names such as Smile and Pear, and where top executives hot desk. At last month\u2019s half-year update, Lewis set a target that by 2020 it would earn between 3.5p and 4p of operating profit for every \u00a31 customers spend. The group currently makes 2.2p in the pound. To get there, however, the grocer needs to slash a further \u00a31.5bn from its cost base by making its stores and distribution network more efficient. Tesco plans to unlock cash tied up in its large store estate by selling the \u201cair rights\u201d above stores in prime locations. Finance director Alan Stewart said an initial 28 stores has been identified for projects that could lead to developers building flats over stores and excess car park space turned into new residential or business premises. The chain also plans tie-ins with Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group, potentially opening dozens more concessions for its Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Evans and Wallis chains inside its supermarkets.",

      "bodyText": "There was still a note of caution around, understandably given the ructions of recent weeks, but investors still managed to push most European markets higher. In the UK, the FTSE 100 was boosted by better than expected retail sales figures, but Italy underperformed amid worries about its forthcoming referendum on constitutional reform. The banking sector in Italy was under particular pressure again. In the US, markets took Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony in their stride, with the Fed chair hinting that a rate rise was likely next month. Disappointing results from Wal-Mart helped limit any gains, however. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: A rapid rise in retail sales in October helped UK stocks gain ground on Thursday despite poorly-received results from Royal Mail. There was a more mixed performance in European shares, with German and Italian indices weighed down by the banking sector. US markets opened mostly higher, though disappointing Walmart results dragged the Dow Jones [down]. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 44.99 points or 0.67% at 6794.71 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.2% to 10,685.54 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.59% to 4527.77 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.03% to 16,555.31 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.92% at 8718.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.49% to 601.07 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 8 points or 0.04%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. If you want to listen to Yellen\u2019s testimony again, it can be replayed here. Janet Yellen, in both her prepared remarks and subsequent comments to Congress, strongly suggested an interest rate rise was on the cards in December, as most economists now expect. She said the economy had strengthened since the Fed\u2019s last meeting and inflation was moving up. But she admitted the aftermath of the US election had caused uncertainty, and the Fed would have to take this into account. And, following Donald Trump\u2019s criticisms that the Fed was making decisons for political purposes, she defended the central bank\u2019s independence. Despite talk in the immediate wake of Trump\u2019s victory that she might resign, she stated clearly she wanted to serve her full term until January 2018. Much discussion of the lack of wage growth and how to tackle it, and how to help people who are not benefitting from the growth in the economy. And some comments about how low interest rates mean companies are more likely to do share buybacks than invest. Yellen says its not clear to her why investment spending has been weak, but denies the Fed\u2019s low interest rate policy is part of the problem. And with profuse thanks for Yellen for turning up, the session ends. Questioning turns to cybersecurity and what steps Fed has taken to address the risks. Yellen says cybersecurity is one of most significant risks the country faces, and the Fed is working with others to make sure there is a system to deal with them. Have to make sure controls financial institutions have in place are sufficient. We are proposing highest standards firms [of systemic importance] should meet. And it is a broad threat and Fed cannot deal with it alone. She says that in every country that has suffered hyperinflation, it was because central banks had to compromise their independence. Yellen defends the independence of central banks (a hot topic at the moment). She says Congress establishes the goals for monetary policy, but it is critical the central bank can make independent decisions to pursue those goals without interference while being accountable and transparent. They need to be able to not think about the short term, and sometimes they need to do unpopular things. Yellen is asked about the Dodd Frank, the legislation brought in to regulate financial institutions after the financial crisis, which Donald Trump has talked about repealing. Yellen says she would not want to turn back the clock, and would not want all the improvements under Dodd Frank eliminated. More on the aftermath of the election. Yellen says that markets are anticipating fiscal policy will be expansionary, and this could have inflationary consequences. But she adds that there is still much uncertainty about future policies. She says, we will watch what decisions are made and factor them into our calculations. Question: Does lack of informantion mean it would be better to delay any rate rise until January. [I believe] uncertainty about these matters will last for some considerable time. We have said gradual increases in rates are likely, near term risks do seem reasonably balanced. The judgement the [Fed] committee reached in November is appropriate one. Can you envisage any circumstances you would not serve out your full term? Yellen: No I cannot...I fully intend to serve out my term [which ends in January 2018. [As a reminder, Donald Trump had been critical of Yellen and there had been some talk she might resign if he won the election] Now for questions. Does the election result effect the Fed\u2019s view on raising rates? Yellen: My own judgement is looking at economic data thus far, the evidence since we met in November is consistent with the expectation of strengthening growth, inflation moving up. [There will be] many economic policies which Congress and the administration will consider in the months to come. When there is greater clarity, the committee will have to factor [that into] their assessments , and perhaps adjust the outlook depending what happens. Yellen has begun her testimony (which as a reminder is available here). As the introductions begin at Congress ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, analysts continue to suggest a rate rise in December is pretty much nailed on. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said: Roll on December. Aside from a slight rise in US Treasury yields we\u2019ve seen little major effect on financial markets after Janet Yellen said interest rates could rise soon. The fact is a December rate hike has already been priced in \u2013 markets think there is a roughly 90% chance the Fed will increase the target federal funds rate. It now looks almost impossible for the Fed not to raise rates next month \u2013 it\u2019s painted itself in a corner and has to respond with a hike or all hell will break loose in the markets. [Jobless numbers] only strengthens the case for the Fed to act. Rising bond yields since Donald Trump\u2019s win further add to the argument for the central bank to raise rates. Ahead of Janet Yellen starting her testimony to Congress [full text here], there has been a spate of US data, none of which makes a rate rise in December less likely. The consumer price index rose 0.4% month on month in October, and 1.6% year on year, both in line with expectations. Economist James Smith at ING Bank said: US inflation is not a massive concern for the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee . That\u2019s the upshot of today\u2019s CPI report, which showed that the headline continued to rise (to 1.6% YoY) and continues to converge on the core rate (now 2.1%) as the effect of earlier oil price weakness filters out. In fact, the transport component made the first positive contribution to the 12-month rate of inflation since 2014. As this energy drag disappears, we expect the headline rate to hit the Fed\u2019s 2% target in the second quarter of next year. If there is one criticism of the overall inflation picture, it is that price gains are not especially broad-based... But that aside, inflation is certainly not a hindrance to a December hike, nor indeed should it be a massive drag on the Fed\u2019s plans for 2017. We may get some further insight from Chair Yellen\u2019s testimony this afternoon. A central part of the discussion both today and amongst Fed officials over coming months will instead revolve around the neutral rate. In her introductory remarks today, Yellen suggested that the Fed funds rate is \u201conly somewhat\u201d below the neutral rate and the \u201crisk of falling behind the curve seems limited\u201d. This indicates that the pace of hikes could continue to be slow next year, although this will of course depend on some of Trump\u2019s fiscal plans. But until the details of these plans become clearer, expect Yellen and other Fed officials to steer away from commenting on this topic. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims hit a 43 year low, down 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000. Analysts had expected a rise to 257,000. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has opened 13 points or 0.07% higher. Donald Trump\u2019s election victory has alarmed and appalled many of our readers. But a new survey has found that wealthy US investors are now MORE confidence about their prospects. UBS Wealth Management Americas latest quarterly Investor Watch report found a jump in optimism among high net worth and ultrahigh net worth investors since last week\u2019s election. They say: UBS surveyed 1,200 wealthy investors immediately before and after the election to determine changes in sentiment and mindset. Since the election, 48% of investors feel optimistic about the short-term economic outlook, up from 39% just 3 weeks earlier. This rise is driven by a sharp increase in optimism among Trump supporters that outweighed a decline among Clinton supporters. Why this optimism, given the concerns over Trump\u2019s policies on (for example) trade? Well, some investors believe Washington needs shaking up, and like Trump\u2019s pledge to cut regulations. His promise to cut taxes must be a factor too. But while Trump fans move their money into riskier assets, Clinton supporters are being much more conservative. Many fear the president-elect will pull America into recession.... The Economist\u2019s Buttonwood column has swiftly commented on Ed Balls\u2019 proposal to reform central bank independence. It argues that some of the criticism heaped on central banks has been unfair: A lot of the current criticism of central banks assumes that they had some hidden political agenda (to support the election of Hillary Clinton or to warn voters off Brexit) behind their policy shifts. That is nonsense, in my view. In a low growth, low inflation world. Central banks have had little option but to keep policy loose; many of those that tried to tighten policy have been forced to retreat. and central banks tend to reflect the consensus view of economists which was that Brexit would be bad news (those who think the consensus view has been proved wrong might note that the government has yet even to start the exit process). In short, central banks may have made mistakes but they are honest mistakes. But Buttonwood isn\u2019t convinced by the most radical part of the paper -- the suggestion that central banks and politicians should co-ordinate on fiscal and monetary policy in times of crisis. On its own merits, this sounds entirely sensible. But if you think central banks are in the political firing line now, what would happen if they started commenting on fiscal policy, particularly close to an election? Imagine if Ms Yellen were to advise the Republicans against tax cuts for the rich? Anyone with an interest in monetary policy should read this excellent paper. But many will find reasons to disagree with it. Off you go then.... Janet Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony hasn\u2019t moved the markets; which makes sense, as most Wall Street economists already expect a rate hike in December. Janet Yellen has resisted any temptation to comment about the US election in her testimony to Congress (boo hiss). The closest she gets is a familiar warning about economic uncertainty: Of course, the economic outlook is inherently uncertain, and, as always, the appropriate path for the federal funds rate will change in response to changes to the outlook and associated risks. Janet Yellen will also tell Congress that America\u2019s economy has made \u201cfurther progress this year\u201d. She begins her testimony by pointing out that the unemployment rate is now just 4.9%, with around 180,000 new jobs created each month in 2016. And she is hopeful that Americans could see decent pay rises soon: Further employment gains may well help support labor force participation as well as wage gains; indeed, there are some signs that the pace of wage growth has stepped up recently. Yellen also points out that America\u2019s growth race picked up in the last three months: After rising at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of this year, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is estimated to have increased nearly 3 percent in the third quarter. In part, the pickup reflected some rebuilding of inventories and a surge in soybean exports. In addition, consumer spending has continued to post moderate gains, supported by solid growth in real disposable income, upbeat consumer confidence, low borrowing rates, and the ongoing effects of earlier increases in household wealth Janet Yellen is pretty clear that the Fed is close to raising rates: At our meeting earlier this month, the Committee judged that the case for an increase in the target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon if incoming data provide some further evidence of continued progress toward the Committee\u2019s objectives. Breaking: Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has warned that it would be a mistake to leave US interest rates unchanged for too long. It\u2019s a hint that borrowing costs could be raised soon, possibly at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in December. That\u2019s the top line from Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony, which she will deliver to Congress in two hours time. Yellen is arguing that if the Fed waits too long, it might find itself having to hike rates more aggressively to calm an over-heating economy. She says: Were the FOMC to delay increases in the federal funds rate for too long, it could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of the Committee\u2019s longer-run policy goals. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive risk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability. The FOMC continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability. More to follow.... The Bank of England is actually closer to a model modern central bank than either the US Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank, according to today\u2019s report anyway. Here\u2019s the scorecard: The BoE scores highly thanks to its suite of \u2018macro-prudential tools\u2019 to manage the economy -- such as the ability to control how much housebuyers can borrow for a mortgage. But the BoE loses marks because there\u2019s no joint body overseeing its work. That\u2019s why Balls, Howat and Stansbury are calling for a UK version of America\u2019s Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). They say: The FSOC...provides a forum for different regulators to challenge the Fed\u2019s views of risks to financial stability and, because it is chaired by the Treasury, it can confer important political legitimacy for contentious regulatory decisions. Today\u2019s report argues that central banks and governments need to work more closely when interest rates have reached rock bottom (the zero lower bound). That could includes showering the economy with \u2018helicopter money\u2019, if government spending cuts have created a low-inflation, low-growth quagmire. Ed Balls, James Howat and Anna Stansbury argue that central banks are struggling to get inflation up to target because governments aren\u2019t spending enough. They say: Many economists have argued that recent austerity has not improved fiscal positions much, and may even have worsened them. Rather, there is reason to believe that fiscal policy is structurally prone to undermine monetary policy at the zero lower bound. Indeed, many governments also responded with austerity in the Depression, the last time that western economies fell into a liquidity trap. Explanations for the popularity of austerity at the zero lower bound include that recessions are opportunities for those calling for a smaller state to trim public expenditure. They can blame the recession on lax fiscal policy during the boom years. Households, particularly those with the median voters, are sympathetic to the argument that the government must \u201ctighten its belt\u201d at the same time as they do. So if austerity drags an economy into a liquidity trap, policymakers may be forced to consider unconventional methods, such as helicopter money -- under which a central bank creates new money to fund an expansionary fiscal policy. This is a controversial issue in economics - and this paper explains how this could happen: The first principle is that the central bank should shape the broad outlines of the coordination. Not only does the central bank have macro-economic expertise which is vital if the coordination is to work, its leadership of the process is crucial to avoiding fiscal dominance. The central bank should be in charge of both initiating and ending the monetary-fiscal coordination process. To minimise political pressures on the central bank, the coordination process also needs to be clearly defined at the outset. In the event of helicopter drops, for example, the central bank needs to outline triggers for stopping them, such as an inflation knockout. This will protect the operational independence of core monetary policy, thereby anchoring inflation expectations. The second principle is that any coordination mechanism must maintain political control over fiscal policy. So although the central bank can propose the outlines of a coordination plan, the government can refuse to participate. What\u2019s more, the coordinating mechanism must distinguish between the stance and the content of fiscal policy. So while the central bank might call for looser fiscal policy, it should not comment on the composition of this loosening. Admittedly, the content of fiscal policy affects its macro-economic impact. Nonetheless, given the political dangers of commenting on individual fiscal items, and the democratic argument for the government to retain discretion over different tax and spending components, any coordination mechanism should limit itself to the fiscal stance. The third principle is that monetary-fiscal coordination should be strictly limited to the zero lower bound. Even if a coordination mechanism effectively protects central bank independence and preserves democratic control over fiscal policy, entering the realm of fiscal policy still presents considerable threats to central bank independence. The prospect of central bankers routinely commenting on fiscal policy may undermine political support for central bank independence or may open up the central bank to reciprocal criticism over monetary policy from the government. By limiting such coordination to only when it is most effective, these risks can be minimised. So much for my prediction that Ed Balls wouldn\u2019t be able to perform any dance moves on the radio.... Ed Balls\u2019 research on central banks is getting some attention this morning, thanks to the Strictly effect. Political journalist Iain Martin reckons Balls made a good argument on the Today Programme this morning (highlights are here) Macroeconomics lecturer David Chivers points out that Balls still supports central bank independence - but with more political oversight. Here\u2019s more reaction from the public: Bloomberg have also covered the Balls paper, and point out that other experts are calling for central bank reforms: Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has said that central bank independence, conceived as a way to stop governments from stoking inflation with measures designed to gain electoral support, is an outdated concept. Governments and monetary policy makers need to cooperate to ensure the maximum effectiveness of stimulus in a world where demand is chronically deficient, he said in a speech at the International Monetary Fund this month. More here: Architect of Bank of England Independence Ed Balls Urges Rethink Here\u2019s my colleague, Angela Monaghan, on Ed Balls\u2019 central banking paper: The Bank of England has become too powerful in the aftermath of the financial crisis and must be reined in, according to the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Balls, one of the masterminds behind the Bank\u2019s independence in 1997, said the issue was \u201cunfinished business\u201d and called for closer ties between Threadneedle Street and government. The former Labour MP and contestant on this year\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing, said that while the Bank should retain operational independence \u2013 setting interest rates and targeting inflation \u2013 it should not have to shoulder the entire burden for maintaining Britain\u2019s financial stability. Balls told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think the case for independent central banks is as strong as it\u2019s ever been. At a time of economic uncertainty but also great political risk, we need the [US] Fed and the Bank of England to play these roles. But the reforms we\u2019ve seen over the last few years have hugely concentrated power in central banks. I think it\u2019s unfinished business... Here\u2019s her full story: Ed Balls is effectively criticising some of the reforms made by his old rival George Osborne. In 1997, the new Labour government handed control of interest rates to the Bank of England, under a \u2018tripartite\u2019 system where financial stability was also handled by the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury. That system was heavily criticised when the credit crunch struck, bringing down Northern Rock, as no-one seemed to be in charge. So Osborne concentrated more power at the Bank of England when he became chancellor in 2010 Our politics editor, Heather Stewart explains all: Newsflash: UK retail sales jumped by 1.9% during October, the biggest monthly rise since July. On an annual basis, consumers bought 7.4% more stuff than in October 2015, which is the biggest rise since April 2002. The ONS says colder weather helped clothes sales, and Halloween larks may also have boosted supermarkets. Hot take: the Brexit vote isn\u2019t stopping Britain hitting the shops.... European credit strategist Tomas Hirst argues that governments have caused the furore over central bank independence, by failing to use their tax and spending powers better: Top central bankers would agree. They often warn that monetary policy can\u2019t create structural reforms or improve productivity - but it does give politicians a window of opportunity to act. However... those decisions can be tough, and unpopular. So loose monetary policy can also dampen the pressure to act (as we\u2019ve seen in the eurozone, where big decisions are only taken when there\u2019s an actual crisis) Ed Balls is also arguing that central banks should welcome more political accountability, as it would protect them in the next financial crisis. The former shadow chancellor told the Today programme that: If in the end when things start to go wrong, everything is concentrated in the Bank of England only, that is politically quite dangerous for the Bank. So, in order to protect independence, the Bank needs more political support and accountability. On Tuesday, BoE governor Mark Carney argued that some politicians are conducting a \u201cmassive blame deflection game\u201d, by saying central banks are the sole cause of inequality and low interest rates. Balls thinks Carney has a point, saying: It\u2019s very worrying seeing Mark Carney being attacked. Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls has told the Today Programme that central bank independence is \u2018unfinished\u2019 business -- and that no country has the perfect central bank set-up yet. He pointed out that central bankers have played a vital role since the financial crisis struck; but now have an awful lot of power: Over the last five years, we have hugely relied on central banks on both sides of the Atlantic to sustain growth, to keep our economies growing, and yet at the same time they\u2019re under big attack. In Congress, the Fed being heavily criticised. We\u2019ve seen not just MPs attacking Mark Carney and the Bank of England, but even our Prime Minister a few weeks ago slapping Mark Carney down. I think the case for independent central banks is as strong as it\u2019s ever been. At a time of economic uncertainty but also great political risk, we need the Fed and the Bank of England to play these roles and we don\u2019t want them to be politically criticised, but, the reforms we\u2019ve seen over the last few years have hugely concentrated power in central banks. That\u2019s why Balls believes the Bank of England needs more accountability to parliament, especially as its monetary policy has such a big impact on the distribution of wealth It\u2019s good to have a financial policy committee making decisions about our whole financial system, but frankly, there\u2019s not sufficient accountability, there\u2019s not a clear target, they\u2019re making [decisions] that are quite distributionally politically sensitive. If things go wrong, then politicians would have to step in and say there\u2019s a gap in the system. What we need is a systemic risk body chaired by the chancellor, which is overseeing the whole system and setting a mandate for the Bank of England and also there if a crisis starts to build, that\u2019s a gap we need to fill. Balls is adamant that central banks have been doing a good job, at a very difficult time, without enough support from the government: The low interest rate policy over the last few years is the only thing that has stopped our economy slipping back into depression. They\u2019ve been trying to meet a target for low inflation, they\u2019ve been undershooting because of the deflation forces in the economy. They\u2019ve been doing their job. We actually say, what we need to have is a better dialogue between central banks and governments. If government had done a bit more work to support the economy through infrastructure spending, that would have made it easier for the Bank of England. Ed Balls\u2019s paper on central bank independence comes at a good time, and not just because he\u2019s still hanging on in Strictly. Disenchantment with central bankers has been growing steadily; as opponents question whether keeping interest rates close to zero and pumping up asset prices was actually working. In Britain, the Bank of England has been under steady fire from pro-Leave campaigners because of its warnings against Brexit. In America, the Federal Reserve has been scorched by Donald Trump. He vowed to replace Fed chair Janet Yellen when her first term ends in 2018. And the European Central Bank has been heavily criticised for its role in eurozone austerity, and for its huge bond-buying programme. Chris Giles of the Financial Times points out that criticism is coming in from across the political spectrum: Concerns about central bank policies and over-reach span the political horizon. They range from president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s accusations that the Fed kept short-term interest rates low at the behest of the Obama administration, Brexiters\u2019 complaints that the BoE\u2019s interventions in the debate over leaving the EU were \u201cbeneath the dignity\u201d of the venerable institution and German politicians\u2019 rage at the European Central Bank\u2019s actions. Most complaints in the US have come from the political right. But in Britain there have been as many from the left. In setting up a review of the BoE, the leadership of the Labour party has questioned whether the central bank should be forced to fund infrastructure projects. Ed Balls is now presenting his paper on the Today programme. He\u2019s arguing that central bank independence must be maintained, but with additional political accountability. He also defends the Bank of England over its current very loose monetary policy. Record low interest rates and quantitative easing (buying government bonds with new money) helped to ward off a new great depression, he agues: After months of delighting, or horrifying, the nation with his dancing skills, Ed Balls has sashayed back to the world of economics by arguing that the independence of the Bank of England should be curbed. The former shadow chancellor has co-authored a new academic paper which examines what a \u2018model central bank\u2019 would look like. It conclude that reforms need to be made, to address the growing public unhappiness about the \u201cunelected, technocratic institutions\u2019 which now play such a massive role in the global economy. And that should includes more political oversight of the Bank of England, to allow politicians and other experts to challenge its decisions where appropriate, creating more accountability. The old consensus that central banks should get as much independence has possible is now inadequate, says the paper - which Balls co-wrote with James Howat and Anna Stansbury of Harvard University. They write: Absolutist interpretations of complete central bank independence may both undermine the pursuit of new central bank objectives and fray the political support that currently exists for central bank autonomy in their core monetary policy function. Indeed, popular discontent towards central banks is growing in the US, UK and the euro-zone. We need a more nuanced approach to central bank independence in this brave new world. Balls was one of the key players behind giving the Bank of England control of monetary policy (back in the 90s, before he swapped Westminster for the dance floor). And this paper argues that new curbs should be brought in, to fight \u2018groupthink\u2019 at the Bank of England. It says: After the centralisation of prudential regulation \u2013 both of the micro and macro variety \u2013 and systemic risk monitoring inside the Bank of England, there is a danger that the UK money-credit constitution is too concentrated in the central bank, leading to the possibility of groupthink, a lack of oversight and ultimately risks to central bank independence. The solution? A body, chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which provides a forum for different regulators to share information, opinions and challenge the central bank perspective. However, the paper still argues firmly that central bank independence is worth fighting for, rather then handing the levers of monetary policy back to the elected politicians. It concludes: The recent US election, and the resulting Republican control of Congress as well as the White House, are widely expected to lead to further criticism of the power and independence of the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, in recent weeks we have seen increasingly open political attacks on Bank of England Governor Mark Carney from Brexit supporters. But we are clear that this is no time to throw the baby out with the bathwater.... We reiterate that the case for operational independence in both monetary and macro-prudential policy is strong: to retreat on this now would be a serious mistake You can see whole report here. Balls is discussing the paper this morning, so we\u2019ll have more details soon. He\u2019s on Radio 4 right now (so no chance to show off those silky moves, alas). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be watching the UK retail sales figures, at 9.30am, to see if British consumers are still shrugging off the Brexit vote. The financial markets look calmer today, after recent wild gyrations following Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. Bond yields have settled down, and the equities markets are expected to open little changed. Things may liven up this afternoon, though, when Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen testifies to Congress (from 3pm GMT or 10am EDT) Yellen is sure to field questions about Trump\u2019s proposal to splurge $1trn on a new infrastructure programme, and also about her own future; as the president-elect has been so critical of her in recent months. Yellen\u2019s testimony should be released at 1pm GMT (8am EDT). And on the corporate front, Royal Mail, Majestic Wine and retailer Ted Baker are reporting results.",

Economist James Smith at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US inflation is not a massive concern for the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee . That\u2019s the upshot of today\u2019s CPI report, which showed that the headline continued to rise (to 1.6% YoY) and continues to converge on the core rate (now 2.1%) as the effect of earlier oil price weakness filters out. In fact, the transport component made the first positive contribution to the 12-month rate of inflation since 2014. </p> <p>As this energy drag disappears, we expect the headline rate to hit the Fed\u2019s 2% target in the second quarter of next year. If there is one criticism of the overall inflation picture, it is that price gains are not especially broad-based...</p> <p>But that aside, inflation is certainly not a hindrance to a December hike, nor indeed should it be a massive drag on the Fed\u2019s plans for 2017. We may get some further insight from Chair Yellen\u2019s testimony this afternoon. A central part of the discussion both today and amongst Fed officials over coming months will instead revolve around the neutral rate. In her introductory remarks today, Yellen suggested that the Fed funds rate is \u201conly somewhat\u201d below the neutral rate and the \u201crisk of falling behind the curve seems limited\u201d. This indicates that the pace of hikes could continue to be slow next year, although this will of course depend on some of Trump\u2019s fiscal plans. But until the details of these plans become clearer, expect Yellen and other Fed officials to steer away from commenting on this topic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile weekly jobless claims hit a 43 year low, down 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000.

Indeed, many governments also responded with austerity in the Depression, the last time that western economies fell into a liquidity trap.</p> <p> Explanations for the popularity of austerity at the zero lower bound include that recessions are opportunities for those calling for a smaller state to trim public expenditure. They can blame the recession on lax fiscal policy during the boom years. Households, particularly those with the median voters, are sympathetic to the argument that the government must \u201ctighten its belt\u201d at the same time as they do. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So if austerity drags an economy into a liquidity trap, policymakers may be forced to consider unconventional methods, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/22/helicopter-money-back-in-the-air\">such as helicopter money -- under which a central bank creates new money to fund an expansionary fiscal policy</a>.</strong></p> <p>This is a controversial issue in economics - and this paper explains how this could happen:</p> <p><strong>The first principle is that the central bank should shape the broad outlines of the coordination.</strong> Not only does the central bank have macro-economic expertise which is vital if the coordination is to work, its leadership of the process is crucial to avoiding fiscal dominance. The central bank should be in charge of both initiating and ending the monetary-fiscal coordination process. To minimise political pressures on the central bank, the coordination process also needs to be clearly defined at the outset. In the event of helicopter drops, for example, the central bank needs to outline triggers for stopping them, such as an inflation knockout. This will protect the operational independence of core monetary policy, thereby anchoring inflation expectations.</p> <p><strong>The second principle is that any coordination mechanism must maintain political control over fiscal policy.</strong> So although the central bank can propose the outlines of a coordination plan, the government can refuse to participate. What\u2019s more, the coordinating mechanism must distinguish between the stance and the content of fiscal policy. So while the central bank might call for looser fiscal policy, it should not comment on the composition of this loosening. Admittedly, the content of fiscal policy affects its macro-economic impact. Nonetheless, given the political dangers of commenting on individual fiscal items, and the democratic argument for the government to retain discretion over different tax and spending components, any coordination mechanism should limit itself to the fiscal stance.</p> <p><strong>The third principle is that monetary-fiscal coordination should be strictly limited to the zero lower bound. </strong>Even if a coordination mechanism effectively protects central bank independence and preserves democratic control over fiscal policy, entering the realm of fiscal policy still presents considerable threats to central bank independence. The prospect of central bankers routinely commenting on fiscal policy may undermine political support for central bank independence or may open up the central bank to reciprocal criticism over monetary policy from the government. By limiting such coordination to only when it is most effective, these risks can be minimised. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67885044574c255d71b1ab3bfc49a15bad73638f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67885044574c255d71b1ab3bfc49a15bad73638f/0_0_650_233/500.jpg\" alt=\".\" width=\"500\" height=\"179\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-17T11:57:25.910Z\">at 11.57am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-582d8fe4e4b03207800c2f00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-17T11:24:06.155Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So much for my prediction that Ed Balls wouldn\u2019t be able to perform any dance moves on the radio....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/799205762107117568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yes, this is a video of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edballs\">@edballs</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcstrictly\">@bbcstrictly</a> fame teaching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcnickrobinson\">@bbcnickrobinson</a> Gangnam style during the eight o&#39;clock news <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/r4today?src=hash\">#r4today</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/yptk5Qf1uj\">pic.twitter.com/yptk5Qf1uj</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/799205762107117568\">November 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582d8d60e4b06ac41294e8c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-17T11:22:54.314Z\">11.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ed Balls\u2019 research on central banks is getting some attention this morning, thanks to the Strictly effect.</strong></p> <p>Political journalist Iain Martin reckons Balls made a good argument on the Today Programme this morning (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/17/ed-balls-bank-of-england-independence-bank-reforms-retail-sales-janet-yellen-business-live?page=with:block-582d6adae4b06ac41294e7fe#block-582d6adae4b06ac41294e7fe\">highlights are here</a>)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/iainmartin1/status/799161933014437889\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Another storming performance from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edballs\">@edballs</a>  - calls for more political accountability for BoE.

In Congress, the Fed being heavily criticised. We\u2019ve seen not just MPs attacking Mark Carney and the Bank of England, but even our Prime Minister a few weeks ago slapping Mark Carney down.</p> <p>I think the case for independent central banks is as strong as it\u2019s ever been. At a time of economic uncertainty but also great political risk, we need the Fed and the Bank of England to play these roles and we don\u2019t want them to be politically criticised, but, the reforms we\u2019ve seen over the last few years have hugely concentrated power in central banks.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s why Balls believes the Bank of England needs more accountability to parliament, especially as its monetary policy has such a big impact on the distribution of wealth</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s good to have a financial policy committee making decisions about our whole financial system, but frankly, there\u2019s not sufficient accountability, there\u2019s not a clear target, they\u2019re making [decisions] that are quite distributionally politically sensitive.</p> <p>If things go wrong, then politicians would have to step in and say there\u2019s a gap in the system. What we need is a systemic risk body chaired by the chancellor, which is overseeing the whole system and setting a mandate for the Bank of England and also there if a crisis starts to build, that\u2019s a gap we need to fill.</p> </blockquote> <p>Balls is adamant that central banks have been doing a good job, at a very difficult time, without enough support from the government:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The low interest rate policy over the last few years is the only thing that has stopped our economy slipping back into depression. They\u2019ve been trying to meet a target for low inflation, they\u2019ve been undershooting because of the deflation forces in the economy. They\u2019ve been doing their job.

      "bodyText": "English fizz and South African wines are likely to enjoy a sales boost as the price of European and US vintages rises with the falling value of the pound, according to the boss of Majestic Wine. Rowan Gormley, chief executive of the off licence chain, which also owns the online business Naked Wines, said shoppers would look for alternatives as the cost of importing goods valued in dollars or euros was likely to rise after an average 15% fall in sterling against those currencies since the Brexit vote. Gormley said that in the short term, Majestic Wine\u2019s shoppers would not see price rises as it had agreed deals which would last \u201ca period of months\u201d ahead. He said there had yet to be any impact on trading. Majestic Wine is also looking at mitigating cost rises by importing more wine in bulk and bottling it in the UK and other cost-saving measures. But he admitted: \u201cIn the long run, if exchange rates remain where they are, all importers of foreign manufactured products are going to have to raise prices.\u201d He said the weakness of the rand against the pound meant that South African wine, which was already growing in popularity before the Brexit vote, was likely to benefit. \u201cEnglish sparkling wine quality has been improving and 2016 is the best vintage for years and years because of the long warm summer. I predict its time has come and the exchange rates are going to help,\u201d he added. In contrast, Gormley predicted that producers from the traditional French regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy, who have been trying to push through price increases for some time, were likely to have a tough time as exchange rates moved against them. Gormley was commenting as he revealed a 13.2% rise in sales to \u00a3205.6m underpinned by strong growth at Majestic Wine\u2019s established stores and a 26.7% rise in sales at Naked Wines. However, underlying pre-tax profits dived 99% to just \u00a3100,000 after the company blew \u00a32m on an unsuccessful leafleting campaign for Naked Wines in the US while income from the group\u2019s commercial division was \u00a32m lower than hoped. Gormley said he believed profits were now on the turn as the company had enlisted more customers and would not repeat its marketing mistake. He admitted the UK market was likely to remain challenging for some time to come. \u201cWe have done everything we can to control the controllables but what we don\u2019t have is a crystal ball that tells us what is going to happen with consumer confidence and exchange rates,\u201d he said.",

Sales at the Walmart-owned chain\u2019s established stores dropped by 5.8% in the three months to 30 September. That was an improvement on the previous quarter, when sales were down by 7.5%, but puts Asda well behind rivals Tesco and Morrisons, which recently reported underlying sales growth. Last week, Sainsbury\u2019s announced a 1% fall in underlying sales in the 28 weeks to 24 September. Walmart said the UK was the only one of its 11 international markets not experiencing growth at stores open for more than a year, as the number of shoppers fell by 4.2% year on year. Operating income also dipped in the UK, with shoppers spending 1.6% less on average on each visit. Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, Brett Biggs, said: \u201cThe key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price.\u201d Asda is trying to fight off heavy competition from the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have stolen its once strong position as the UK\u2019s cheapest grocer. Asda only operates large outlets and has been unable to tap into the rise of convenience stores, unlike Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s. It has also suffered from a number of recent upsets, including a card reader glitch that led to angry queues of customers in stores last month and a BBC Watchdog investigation that criticised Asda for dirty home delivery crates. Patrick O\u2019Brien, an analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail, said: \u201cAsda\u2019s positioning has plunged it into crisis. The discounters have undermined its low price stance, but it is unable to position its brand or customer experience as offering more than the discounters, in the way that its big four rivals have been able to do. The others never traded on being the cheapest, but Asda did, and now it isn\u2019t.\u201d He said that unless Walmart chose to use its financial muscle \u201cto take the price war to a new level\u201d, Asda had to find a new way to attract shoppers. Sean Clarke, who stepped in to replace Andy Clarke as chief executive of Asda in July, said shopper numbers had started rising again over the previous quarter. \u201cWe have lowered thousands of prices, improved hundreds of own brand products and invested in more hours for colleagues on the shop floor, so it\u2019s encouraging to see more customers shopping with us in stores and online,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Sterling was the worst performing currency in the world last month. An employment tribunal ruled against Uber drivers being classified as self-employed. October brought with it the first GDP figures since the Brexit vote, which were better than expected. All while the ratings agency Moody\u2019s threatened to downgrade Britain\u2019s credit status if it leaves the European single market. You would think that the next generation of economists were ready with a range of models and tools to analyse and make sense of these events. But the limitations of a standard undergraduate economics education are such that few can honestly say they are prepared for the task. To illustrate the point, a review of 172 economics modules at seven UK universities showed that only 22% of exam marks required students to illustrate any critical or independent thinking and this dropped to 6.7% for compulsory modules. It is not an overstatement to say that economics students can go through their entire degree without once being asked to express an opinion. This neglect of critical thought and independent judgment is at odds with what employers of economics graduates need and what citizens expect from the experts responsible for the health of their economy. Highlighting the problem in economics departments across the UK is the new book The Econocracy, with a foreword by the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane. It has been four years since economics students in the UK started to call for reform to their economics education. We were a generation that came of age during the chaos of the 2008 global financial crisis and we were shocked by how little the problems of the real world intruded on the abstract picture of the economy described in our classrooms. Frustration led us to set up societies with names like the Cambridge Society for Economic Pluralism and Manchester\u2019s Post-Crash Economics Society. We called for an education with more critical thinking, real world context, history and \u201cpluralism\u201d: exposing students to contrasting economic frameworks (feminist, Austrian, post-Keynesian) to give them a range of ways to think about the economy and allow them to judge which are best at answering different economic questions. We set up the network Rethinking Economics, which now connects 45 groups across the world and 16 in the UK. The good news then is that universities are beginning to change. Manchester has brought in new modules on economic policy and financial crises and Cambridge has introduced a new module on economic history. Some universities including Greenwich, Goldsmiths and Kingston have gone even further and are fully reforming their curricula. These are major achievements and they illustrate that there is widespread agreement that economics education must be better. This doesn\u2019t mean our campaign is over though; only that the fault lines have shifted. Pretty much everyone now agrees that an economics education must include more history, critical thinking and engagement with the real world. However, the call for pluralism \u2013 possibly the most important aspect of our campaign - is still rejected by most universities. Economics education currently teaches only one perspective, neoclassical economics: of the 172 module course outlines we analysed, only 17 mentioned alternative perspectives. Tomorrow\u2019s economists are taught that neoclassical economics provides the single correct and universal explanation of how the economy functions. Opening up economics, by giving the next generation of economists a pluralist education, will provide crucially needed tools to address the challenges we face as a society. Every other social science acknowledges the need for pluralism. Refusing to do the same in economics is restricting our collective ability to build healthy and prosperous societies and we are all poorer for it.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is to deepen its relationship with Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group, potentially opening dozens more concessions for its Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Evans and Wallis chains in supermarkets. The two companies first partnered up about a year ago when Tesco put 14 Arcadia group concessions in five stores including Chesterfield, Woolwich in south London and Culverhouse Cross in Cardiff. A further four stores will host about six more Arcadia concessions by the end of the year as part of the supermarket\u2019s efforts to find a profitable use for spare space in large stores. Supermarkets are trying to downsize as shoppers switch to buying goods such as TVs and microwaves online. Tesco told analysts attending a presentation at the group\u2019s Welwyn Garden City headquarters on Wednesday that the Arcadia tie-up was part of plans to have at least 26 concessions by the end of this year, including a handful of Holland &amp; Barrett outlets. Tesco then hopes to open up to 35 more concessions a year, although it is not clear how many of those would be Arcadia brands. The new avenue of expansion comes as a boon for Arcadia, which lost dozens of concessions with the closure of BHS, the department store chain once owned by Green that collapsed in controversial circumstances this spring. The group has also been closing smaller high street stores as the whole fashion market struggles to cope with the switch to online shopping and a wave of unseasonal weather conditions over the past two years. Green said the Tesco concessions were \u201chopefully something we can grow\u201d. He said the two companies had decided to expand their relationship after a good response from shoppers. \u201cCustomers like it and obviously Tesco has got great footfall [of shoppers]. It works for everybody,\u201d he said. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said Tesco had indicated that the 26 concessions would generate nearly \u00a34m in rental income a year for the retailer. If Tesco opens 35 more concessions a year over the next five years that could bring in as much as \u00a340m a year. Aside from Arcadia and Holland &amp; Barrett, Tesco has also experimented with hosting Claire\u2019s Accessories, Pavers and Sock Shop in various stores.",

      "bodyText": "A surprise leap in retail sales volumes last month has boosted hopes the UK economy will end the year on a high note, as consumers continue to shrug off the shock of the Brexit vote. A rush to buy winter clothes and buoyant Halloween trade for supermarkets helped UK retail sales grow at the fastest annual pace for 14 years in October, according to official figures. Defying gloomy predictions before the EU referendum that a vote to leave could spark recession, the figures showed households continued to increase their spending last month and retail sales volumes were up 7.4% on a year earlier. That was the strongest growth since early 2002 and beat forecasts for growth of 5.3% in a Reuters poll of economists. On the month, sales were up by 1.9%, well ahead of forecasts for a 0.4% rise. But economists were quick to warn the growth would be hard to sustain. The Office for National Statistics said there were several factors behind the October improvement. \u201cCooler temperatures in October boosted clothing sales as shoppers took their cue to purchase winter clothing, while the supermarkets benefited from Halloween. This has also coincided with the strongest growth in internet sales seen for five years,\u201d said Kate Davies, an ONS senior statistician. The jump in sales on a year ago came as all types of retailers, from grocers to petrol stations, enjoyed some growth. The biggest contribution came from non-store retailing, which includes market stalls and mail order as well as internet-only retailers such as Amazon. Average weekly spending online was \u00a31bn, an increase of 26.8% compared with October 2015. Separate figures from online retail trade body IMRG showed home goods performed particularly well last month, with spending up 24% on the year. \u201cThis could have been spurred by a deteriorating pound, with people more focused on domestic home improvements rather than spending on holidays abroad \u2013 which have become a lot more expensive since the Brexit vote,\u201d IMRG said, in its monthly sales snapshot published with consultancy Capgemini. Economists said the overall rise in retail sales was encouraging for the economy\u2019s growth prospects in the final quarter of this year, but there were warnings that consumer spending could slow next year. \u201cClearly, this is a great start to fourth quarter GDP on the spending side,\u201d said Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London. He said the weak pound may have played a role as it continues to attract tourists to the UK looking to snap up luxury items. \u201cIt could also be consumers bringing forward spending to today, in anticipation of higher prices tomorrow,\u201d he added. After official inflation data this week came in weaker than economists expected, showing that prices rose by 0.9% year on year in October, the ONS said retail figures showed there were falls in average prices across all store types last month, except petrol stations. But the drop in average store prices was the smallest for more than two years at 0.7% and will be taken as a further sign the UK\u2019s long spell of very low inflation is coming to an end. The drop in sterling against other currencies since the Brexit vote has raised import costs to the UK and been passed on to consumers in the prices of household goods including Marmite. That would make October\u2019s \u201cmini-boom\u201d for retailers hard to repeat, said Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit. \u201cSuch strong growth is clearly unsustainable, and cracks are in fact already appearing. Survey data highlight how households are struggling to support existing spending due to weak income growth and rising prices, and how this negative trend is likely to intensify in coming months,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Increased infrastructure spending in the US and UK could boost business at consultancy group WS Atkins, the company said, even as its profits were hit by tough markets for its oil and gas division. Half year pretax profits fell 58% to \u00a322.4m, partly due to a \u00a323m write-down of North American oil and gas outlets. But its UK and other US businesses performed well, and it has kept its outlook for the year unchanged. And it is looking forward to next week\u2019s Autumn Statement, and more details on US president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s spending plans. Chief executive Uwe Krueger told Reuters: There is a strong intent by the governments, be it the new administration of president-elect Trump or be it here in the UK, to continue to be steadfast or even significantly increase investment into infrastructure...and that plays very much to our strengths. However the profit fall has seen Atkins\u2019 shares lose nearly 2% to \u00a316.28. Analysts at Numis were still positive: In-line interims and an unchanged outlook mean that we leave forecasts unchanged. As previously stated, the better performing businesses have continued to do well (UK, North America) while Middle East and oil &amp; gas have faced headwinds. Looking medium term, management references government commitments and a need for infrastructure spending (UK, US), and we note strong recent peer group share prices, particularly post Trump... Applying a peer group 2017 multiple to our 2018 forecasts, we raise our target to 1900p from 1710p. Among the mid-caps, AA has accelerated 5.4p to 259.8p after it unveiled a bond exchange package which should reduce interest costs and enhance its credit profile. Liberum analysts said: The cash interest saving may mitigate any potential increase in the pension deficit recovery payments from the current level of \u00a314m as a result of the triennial review, which management expect to see shortly, with agreement expected before June 2017 (noting the \u00a3622m IAS 19 deficit at the interims). Management is looking at ways of mitigating any impact from the increase in deficit. We leave our estimate unchanged at this stage... From a P&amp;L perspective, we can see a \u00a35m charge in 2017 and a \u00a35m benefit from 2018 onwards. From a cash flow perspective there are \u00a320m of up front costs, but \u00a340m of interest savings over 5 years (\u00a38m x5). Lower down the market, eSports company Gfinity has jumped 8% to 11.25p after it launched a new eSports league format, Gfinity Elite Series. Analyst David Johnson at its broker Allenby Capital said: The series will generate sponsorship and broadcasting rights for Gfinity [and] represents a major investment for Gfinity and commercialisation is at a very early stage. As a result we are suspending our forecasts until proof points start to emerge. Gfinity has demonstrated its ability to successfully stage high quality arena-based and smaller online events and built relationships with publishers, broadcasters, sponsors and players. The Elite Series represents the next level and enables Gfinity to capitalise on its reputation and a substantial opportunity. Finally, another new entrant to the Aim market will make its debut at the end of the month. Cosmetics group Warpaint London, whose flagship brand is W7, has raised \u00a323m in a placing and is expected to join the market at 97p a share, valuing the business at \u00a362.6m. The move will allow the company to raise its profile and get access to capital, as well as enabling it to use paper for potential acquisitions. The company is profitable, with half year earnings increasing from \u00a32.6m to \u00a33.3m.",

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail says Brexit uncertainty causing dip in junk mail sent by post", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Uncertainty over the Brexit vote and its consequences has led to a dip in the amount of junk mail sent through the postal system, according to the Royal Mail. The company said its revenue from marketing mail fell by 8% over the past six months as businesses reined in their spending on advertising due to uncertainty about the outcome of the EU referendum and what form Brexit would take. This decline was part of a broader 4% fall in the number of letters sent via Royal Mail in the six months to 25 September, although parcel volumes rose 2%. Households will likely welcome the fall in junk mail but it is another headache for Royal Mail, which was state-owned until it floated in 2013. It is not only battling a decline in the number of letters Britons send but competition from UK Mail, DHL and Amazon, which has built its own logistics and delivery network. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, urged the postal industry watchdog to step in and protect Royal Mail\u2019s obligation to deliver letters to any address in the UK six days a week. He said: \u201cGiven the continued decline in letter volumes and growing competition in the industry, we call on the regulator Ofcom to ensure its ongoing review of Royal Mail guarantees the company has sufficient revenues and resources to protect daily deliveries and support the UK\u2019s vital universal postal service.\u201d Royal Mail reported a 1% rise in revenue to \u00a34.6bn during the period, but pre-tax profits fell from \u00a3116m to \u00a3110m. Growth in its parcels business was not enough to offset a 6% deterioration in second-quarter letter volumes. \u201cWe have doubts that parcels revenue can fully offset the secular decline in letters revenue,\u201d wrote analysts at broker Liberum, who added that Royal Mail\u2019s share price already priced in any future growth. Shares in Royal Mail closed down 7% on Thursday at 464p, compared with a flotation price of 330p. Moya Greene, Royal Mail\u2019s chief executive, said the performance was \u201cbroadly in line with our expectations\u201d and the drop in letter volumes was within the company\u2019s forecast. Greene also revealed that Royal Mail is increasing the amount it intends to cut by 2018 from \u00a3500m to \u00a3600m and is reducing its capital expenditure from an average of \u00a3615m per year over the last three years to \u00a3500m. The company is now preparing for the vital festive season, when the surge in online shopping orders and sending of Christmas cards lead to its busiest period of the year. \u201cAs always, our performance for the full year will be dependent on the important Christmas period,\u201d Greene said. \u201cExtensive planning, which began in the spring, will help us to manage our busiest time. This includes the recruitment of over 19,000 temporary staff and opening nine temporary parcel sort centres.\u201d Nicholas Hyett, analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said the declines in the letter business were \u201cpainful\u201d. He said: \u201cThe 5% fall in underlying profits at Royal Mail is largely the result of continuing weakness in the letters business. True, the decline is in line with company expectations but it\u2019s still painful. Fortunately the European business is delivering a strong performance, boosted by currency movements, and continues to pick up the slack.\u201d Meanwhile, rival UK Mail also revealed on Thursday that it posted a far smaller 0.4% drop in daily mail volumes over the past six months. However, it suffered a 2.1% drop in average daily parcel volumes, which it blamed on strong growth in the same period last year after taking on customers from City Link, which collapsed in 2015. Overall UK Mail, which recently agreed a \u00a3243m takeover offer from Deutsche Post, suffered a 3.2% drop in revenues to \u00a3230m in the six months to the end of September, but pre-tax profits rose 17% to \u00a35.8m.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are heading higher, with Anglo American among the risers despite the group suspending operations at a copper mine in Chile. It said protesters had seized installations at the Los Broncos mine on Wednesday, and it had decided to evacuate staff for safety reasons. But its shares are up 26p to \u00a311.20 as Credit Suisse raised its price target from 970p to \u00a313, partly on (longer term) break-up hopes, while Deutsche Bank was also positive. Credit Suisse said: With the strong recovery in coal prices and balance sheet metrics it seems increasingly likely that the divestment plan outlined earlier this year will be watered down and executed at a much slower pace. While this will bring question marks over group strategy, we believe it is the sensible course of action and should refocus investor attention back to the South Africa (SA) businesses. Next week\u2019s site trip to SA and Botswana could begin to shed light on management\u2019s restructuring plans for next year. We raise 2017 earnings on higher coal prices and lift our target Price to \u00a313 a share from \u00a39.7 a share. A full break-up of the business still looks compelling to us given some of the core assets - in particular the two major copper assets - could attract significantly higher valuations than is currently being ascribed by the market. Our break-up valuations is around \u00a318 a share or over 60% potential upside. Overall the FTSE 100 has added 17.06 points to 6766.78, with better than expected retail sales helping high street chains. Next is up 75p at \u00a351.65 and Debenhams is 1.1p better at 57.10p. Marks &amp; Spencer however is down 3p at 334.5p as its shares went ex-dividend. Also being quoted without the shareholder payout was Imperial Brands, 27p lower at \u00a334.41. The biggest loser so far is Royal Mail, down 21.7p at 477.2p after its first half profits fell 5% and said it would raise its cost cutting target from \u00a3500m to \u00a3600m. Rolls-Royce has fallen another 17p to 721.5p in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s update, but Capita is on the rise despite being caught in a two way pull. Analysts at Stifel moved from hold to buy, saying: Capita finds itself at a moment of two way heightened risk but the group\u2019s woes need to be relativized. It is not a \u201cbad\u201d company, it has hit a few snags on the road but it hasn\u2019t done anything fundamentally wrong. The group\u2019s rating (8.5 times 2017 PE, at a discount to Mitie) is wrong, in our view. Our call is that a modest re-rating is likely as balance sheet issues and concerns over earnings risks move into the rear view mirror. We see around 17% upside potential by applying a 10 times multiple to our 2017 forecasts. But Robin Speakman at Shore Capital issued a sell note: We have examined the likely scenarios for the outsourcing services conglomerate in restructuring and conclude that guidance is subject to significant risk... Post the share price fall since the warning of 29 September Capita may now look cheap. Yet visibility into next year and beyond is clouded by uncertainty over the impact of restructuring the business to refocus on organic growth, the impact of cost reduction and the likely cost of this as well as markets which continue to be tough, in our view. We have taken a further look at our estimates post the September profit warning and have determined that these were too optimistic given the November statement on restructuring (in particular for 2017). Accordingly, given the challenges being presented to the group, perhaps some being self-made, we cut our forecasts further \u2013 this in anticipation of stronger organic growth taking longer than previously expected to kick-in and with the prospect of several businesses being moved to discontinued, closed or held for sale. 2017 looks to us like a year of retrenchment with new firmer foundations for future growth attempting to be built. With an assumption of higher organic revenue growth emerging, margins still remain a concern for us, cost cutting being required to potentially meet our forecasts; but what of investment in the cost base (including intangibles development) from which to sustain longer-term growth? We downgrade our forecasts... The balance sheet precludes further acquisition activity prior to a new equity raise, in our view. We forecast a held dividend, noting the attractions of a 5.6% yield. From the current low point in the share price, we would urge selling into strength. Among the mid-caps, Virgin Money is down 21.5p at 317p after shareholder WL Ross placed its remaining 53m shares - 12% of the business - at 320p each. Investec said: This increases the free-float to around 65%, leaving only Virgin Group\u2019s 35% stake which, (rightly or wrongly), we assume to be a \u201cquasi-permanent\u201d investment rather than presenting a private equity style \u201coverhang\u201d risk. We see the WL Ross selldown as a technical positive. However, we continue to see considerably greater value in Aldermore (Buy), Shawbrook (Buy) and OneSavings (Buy) despite their recent outperformance.",

Analysts at Stifel moved from hold to buy, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Capita finds itself at a moment of two way heightened risk but the group\u2019s woes need to be relativized. It is not a \u201cbad\u201d company, it has hit a few snags on the road but it hasn\u2019t done anything fundamentally wrong. The group\u2019s rating (8.5 times 2017 PE, at a discount to Mitie) is wrong, in our view. Our call is that a modest re-rating is likely as balance sheet issues and concerns over earnings risks move into the rear view mirror. We see around 17% upside potential by applying a 10 times multiple to our 2017 forecasts.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Robin Speakman at Shore Capital issued a sell note:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have examined the likely scenarios for the outsourcing services conglomerate in restructuring and conclude that guidance is subject to significant risk...</p> <p>Post the share price fall since the warning of 29 September Capita may now look cheap. Yet visibility into next year and beyond is clouded by uncertainty over the impact of restructuring the business to refocus on organic growth, the impact of cost reduction and the likely cost of this as well as markets which continue to be tough, in our view. We have taken a further look at our estimates post the September profit warning and have determined that these were too optimistic given the November statement on restructuring (in particular for 2017). Accordingly, given the challenges being presented to the group, perhaps some being self-made, we cut our forecasts further \u2013 this in anticipation of stronger organic growth taking longer than previously expected to kick-in and with the prospect of several businesses being moved to discontinued, closed or held for sale. 2017 looks to us like a year of retrenchment with new firmer foundations for future growth attempting to be built. With an assumption of higher organic revenue growth emerging, margins still remain a concern for us, cost cutting being required to potentially meet our forecasts; but what of investment in the cost base (including intangibles development) from which to sustain longer-term growth? We downgrade our forecasts...</p> <p>The balance sheet precludes further acquisition activity prior to a new equity raise, in our view. We forecast a held dividend, noting the attractions of a 5.6% yield. From the current low point in the share price, we would urge selling into strength.</p> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>Virgin Money</strong> is down 21.5p at 317p after shareholder WL Ross placed its remaining 53m shares - 12% of the business - at 320p each. Investec said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This increases the free-float to around 65%, leaving only Virgin Group\u2019s 35% stake which, (rightly or wrongly), we assume to be a \u201cquasi-permanent\u201d investment rather than presenting a private equity style \u201coverhang\u201d risk. We see the WL Ross selldown as a technical positive. However, we continue to see considerably greater value in Aldermore (Buy), Shawbrook (Buy) and OneSavings (Buy) despite their recent outperformance. </p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has become too powerful in the aftermath of the financial crisis and must be reined in, according to the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Balls, one of the masterminds behind the Bank\u2019s independence in 1997, said the issue was \u201cunfinished business\u201d and called for closer ties between Threadneedle Street and government. The former Labour MP and contestant on this year\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing, said that while the Bank should retain operational independence \u2013 setting interest rates and targeting inflation \u2013 it should not have to shoulder the entire burden for maintaining Britain\u2019s financial stability. Balls told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think the case for independent central banks is as strong as it\u2019s ever been. At a time of economic uncertainty but also great political risk, we need the [US] Fed and the Bank of England to play these roles. But the reforms we\u2019ve seen over the last few years have hugely concentrated power in central banks. I think it\u2019s unfinished business.\u201d In the aftermath of the financial crisis the Bank of England was handed more powers by the government, assuming responsibility for financial stability as well as monetary policy. Balls said that it had left a gap in accountability, and called for a new layer of oversight to be introduced, led by the chancellor. \u201cWhat we need is a systemic risk body chaired by the chancellor, which is overseeing the whole system and setting a mandate for the Bank of England and also there if a crisis starts to build, that\u2019s a gap we need to fill,\u201d he added. He was speaking following the publication of a paper titled Central bank independence revisited, which Balls, as a senior fellow at the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, co-wrote with James Howat and Anna Stansbury. The authors write: \u201cIn the wake of the financial crisis, central banks accumulated large numbers of new responsibilities, often in an ad hoc way. The old academic assumption that the more independent a central bank is, the better it is, should no longer hold.\u201d Balls\u2019s comments come at a time of intense debate about the role of central bankers, both in the UK and the US. Policymakers at the Bank of England and at the US Federal Reserve have come under heavy criticism in recent months for being over-politicised and for keeping interest rates too low for too long. Theresa May appeared to criticise the Bank when she said savers were being hit by the low interest rate environment, while prominent Tories William Hague and Michael Gove were directly critical of Threadneedle Street and Carney. In the US, President-elect Donald Trump accused the Fed of being political. Earlier this week, Carney hit back at accusations by politicians that central bank policies were driving an increase in inequality, telling MPs on the Treasury select committee that it was a \u201cmassive blame-deflection exercise\u201d. The governor has persistently argued that the current ultra-low rate environment is a symptom of the economic backdrop, and not a driver of it. Balls said it was wrong for central bankers to come under political attack. \u201cOver the last five years, we have hugely relied on central banks on both sides of the Atlantic to sustain growth, to keep our economies growing, and yet at the same time they\u2019re under big attack. In Congress, the Fed is being heavily criticised,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen not just MPs attacking [the governor] and the Bank of England, but even our prime minister a few weeks ago slapping Mark Carney down. It\u2019s very worrying.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Executives from the world\u2019s largest mining company have urged Donald Trump to uphold the Paris climate pact, while warning the \u201cwhole world will be in trauma\u201d if the incoming US president follows through on tariffs against China. BHP Billiton chief executive Andrew McKenzie told shareholders in Brisbane that he hoped Trump maintained US support of the Paris agreement and built on crucial cooperation with China on climate action begun by his predecessor. BHP Billiton chairman Jac Nasser said Trump\u2019s pledge to apply 45% blanket tariffs on Chinese imports would trigger a damaging trade war but predicted this was part of his election campaign \u201crhetoric\u201d which would not materialise. Nasser also said it would take years for the mining giant to fully resolve the fallout from its Brazilian mine disaster, as advocates for devastated communities again raised concerns about the exclusion of some from a compensation process and with the pace of its environmental clean up. The fallout from the Samarco mine disaster, along with plummeting oil and iron ore prices have wreaked havoc with BHP Billiton\u2019s bottom line with the Anglo-Australian mining giant posting a record full-year loss of $US6.39bn ($A8.29bn) in August. McKenzie told the annual general meeting that BHP Billiton \u2013 which was questioned by one shareholder about the prospect it would be marooned in the future selling \u201cdinosaur products\u201d \u2013 welcomed the COP21 agreement on emissions cuts to limit global warming. \u201cWe do hope that President Trump doesn\u2019t actually tear up the agreement of the United States to support that and also the very strong bond that president Obama and Xi Jinping forged on that because we see this is a strong foundation for future action,\u201d McKenzie said. Asked about the impact on BHP if the US went ahead with tariffs against China \u2013 which accounts for $14b or 41% of the miner\u2019s earnings \u2013 Nasser said: \u201cWoah. I can\u2019t explain Donald Trump to you.\u201d He said the US election had thrown up \u201cquite a lot of rhetoric, some of which will happen and some of which will not\u201d. Nasser said that \u201csome of the policies that have been listed at this stage will probably be moderated over time\u201d, later telling reporters \u201cthe wall [between the US and Mexico] became a fence\u201d. But he said \u201cthe whole world will start to be in complete trauma if tariff levels of that size and magnitude are put on across the board\u201d and that other countries were certain to retaliate. The company held a minute\u2019s silence at the start of the annual general meeting in memory of the 19 victims of the Samarco dam collapse last year, after a request from dissident shareholders on behalf of the affected communities. It maintained its rejection of criminal charges laid by Brazilian prosecutors against the company and current and former employees, saying it would fully fund legal defences. Last month 26 people were charged, 21 for qualified homicide, for their alleged roles in the disaster, which sent a tidal wave of mining waste hundreds of miles through the Minas Gerais region in November 2015. A Brazilian executive told shareholders a foundation set up by BHP Billiton to fund the initial humanitarian response, compensation and the environmental clean up had made particular progress in recent weeks. The company flagged a bigger round of compensation for those affected by the bursting of the tailings dam, including hundreds made homeless, in the new year. Nasser said \u201cmany challenges\u201d remained for the company in making good on the disaster, which has also left hundreds homeless. \u201cSome will take years to resolve fully. There will be setbacks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let me be very clear: we remain committed to doing the right thing.\u201d Nasser said the Samarco disaster was a \u201ckey consideration\u201d in the board decision to award McKenzie no performance bonuses in 2016, which was \u201cconsistent with Andrew\u2019s view\u201d. Rodrigo de Castro Am\u00e9d\u00e9e P\u00e9ret, a Franciscan friar from the area who attended BHP Billiton\u2019s AGM in London last month, said in a statement that locals had \u201clost everything, without receiving any real compensation\u201d. \u201cInstead of reparations for the victims, what is becoming evident is the blatant corporate capture of our government by transnational companies,\u201d he said. Natalie Lowrey, of Australia\u2019s Mineral Policy Institute, said BHP and its business partners were ignoring those most affected by the tailings dam collapse, by denying them \u201cmeaningful participation in decision-making about the clean-up and compensation\u201d. Lowrey, who had requested the minute\u2019s silence, said locals wanted \u201cfor everyone who has been affected to be recognised \u2013 the companies shouldn\u2019t be picking and choosing who gets help\u201d. McKenzie told reporters after the meeting that the company had \u201cso much to do and we have to be impatient\u201d in the wake of the disaster. He acknowledged concerns raised last month in London that \u201csome parts of the population felt less consulted than they would have wished\u201d. He said the company wanted the recovery and compensation process \u201chighly determined by the local community and not external agencies\u201d and \u201cclearly we\u2019ll get feedback\u201d. \u201cI hope we\u2019re perfect but I would expect that there would be pockets we will not reach and then we\u2019ll have to compensate,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cEverybody involved will make claims but those claims will therefore have to be appropriately judged both in terms of whether there is a claim there and what is the appropriate size and that\u2019s what the whole process is. \u201cAnd for the larger claims, clearly for that to be fair and in light of how the foundation was designed, that will take a bit more time than just providing some emergency cash which was what we did just after the accident.\u201d As of last month, BHP had booked $2.2bn (\u00a31.8bn) of costs linked to the accident and issued 7,000 \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d cards to allow affected people to buy food, adding that the firm had made a \u201csuperhuman effort\u201d to support people.",

      "bodyText": "This week came the news that once again a record low has been set for wages growth. The wages price index in the past year rose by just 1.9% \u2013 a full percentage point below the level of growth that occurred when Australia was in the midst of the global financial crisis. It means that real wages have not grown at all for more than three years. If you like records being broken, now is the most exciting time to look at economic data. The annual growth of wages in September of 1.9% was a new record low, breaking the old mark of 2.1% set only three months ago in June. It was the 16th consecutive fall in the growth of annual wages. The last time Australians wages grew faster than they had three months earlier was September 2012: The new annual record low came off the back of another record low quarterly growth \u2013 just 0.4% in seasonally adjusted terms. The private sector has now seen wages grow by less that 0.5% in seven consecutive quarters. Prior to this run, there had only been one quarter in the history of the wages price index below that level (during the GFC): But while as a general rule public sector wages grow faster than the private sector, the public sector is also experiencing record low wages growth \u2013 just 2.3% in the past year: The narrative around public sector wages is often rather skewed \u2013 as though we\u2019re talking about bureaucrats getting fat off the taxpayers. At the moment there is a fair bit of dispute \u2013 literally so in some cases \u2013 over the federal government\u2019s public sector bargaining policy. The drive to keep annual pay rises below 2% has seen some pay disputes last over three years. The lack of pay rises for commonwealth public servants can be seen in the weak growth of public sector wages in the ACT. Unlike other states, the public sector of the ACT is dominated by those working for the Australian public service, rather than teachers, healthcare workers and other non-bureaucratic workers as is the case elsewhere. In the past year, the average wages of public sector workers in the ACT rose just 1.8% \u2013 lower than the rate of private sector workers across the nation. And this is not a recent phenomenon. The last time ACT public sector wages grew faster than that of private sector workers was March 2013. Over the past five years, wages for the private sector have risen by 13.6% compared to 12.4% for ACT public sector workers. Even going back 10 years, ACT public sector workers have had lower pay rises than that of private sector workers across the country \u2013 34.9% compared to 36.2%: The slowing growth of wages across the country is being driven by a couple of factors. Firstly, the mining industry is massively off the boil. For just over 10 years from the middle of 2004, wages in the mining sector grew faster than everywhere else. But this situation reversed in the middle of last year: And it wasn\u2019t just that workers in the mining sector during the boom years were on average getting better pay raises than everyone else, they were also the source of the biggest pay rises. A review of 18,000 different jobs by the RBA and the ABS found that in 2012, over 60% of mining sector pay rises were greater than 4% per annum; now it is less than 10%. Such falls in the proportion of above average wage rises has occurred across all industries, and so too has the size of those large wage rises. In 2012 the average of wage rises above 4% was 7.5%, now it is 5.75%. The biggest wage rises over the past year have come in the education and healthcare industries, and also rather surprisingly, the accommodation and food industry. This is a surprise because, as a general rule, that industry usually sees the worst wages growth. Over the past 10 years, wages in that industry have increased just 31.6%, well below the national average of 37.1%. A main driver of the increase in that industry is the 2.4% increase in the minimum wage handed down by the Fair Work Commission that came into effect on 1 July. By contrast the mining sector is currently the worst performing industry for wage rises, and yet over the past 10 years it has been the best. But given in the past four years its workforce has shrunk by 20%, it is doubtful there are many workers who have been around for the full 10 years: All up, the poor wages growth means that real wages continue to be flat. When comparing wage growth to the RBA\u2019s underlying inflation measure, real wages haven\u2019t grown by any appreciable level for three years. They have done better when compared to the employee cost of living index, but this is mostly due to the impact of interest rate cuts, and as result can be a rather erratic measure: Since 2002, real wages have gone through four stages \u2013 the mining-boom, the GFC-flatness, the post-GFC improvement, and then the now three year run of near stagnation: As the US political system has shown, when real incomes stay flat, voters get angry. We\u2019re now three years into a run of stagnant real wages, don\u2019t be surprised if people start looking for someone to blame.",

The last time Australians wages grew faster than they had three months earlier was September 2012:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wage price index - annual growth - public and private sectors\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ha14p/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The new annual record low came off the back of another record low quarterly growth \u2013 just 0.4% in seasonally adjusted terms.</p> <p>The private sector has now seen wages grow by less that 0.5% in seven consecutive quarters. Prior to this run, there had only been one quarter in the history of the wages price index below that level (during the GFC):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wage price index - quarterly growth (trend)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ikLfs/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But while as a general rule public sector wages grow faster than the private sector, the public sector is also experiencing record low wages growth \u2013 just 2.3% in the past year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wages price index - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HaD3S/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The narrative around public sector wages is often rather skewed \u2013 as though we\u2019re talking about bureaucrats getting fat off the taxpayers. At the moment there is a fair bit of dispute \u2013 literally so in some cases \u2013 over the federal government\u2019s public sector bargaining policy. The drive to keep annual pay rises below 2% has seen some pay disputes last over three years.</p> <p>The lack of pay rises for commonwealth public servants can be seen in the weak growth of public sector wages in the ACT. Unlike other states, the public sector of the ACT is dominated by those working for the Australian public service, rather than teachers, healthcare workers and other non-bureaucratic workers as is the case elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/16/australian-wages-growing-at-slowest-rate-on-record-statistics-show\">Australian wages growing at slowest rate on record</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the past year, the average wages of public sector workers in the ACT rose just 1.8% \u2013 lower than the rate of private sector workers across the nation. And this is not a recent phenomenon.</p> <p>The last time ACT public sector wages grew faster than that of private sector workers was March 2013. Over the past five years, wages for the private sector have risen by 13.6% compared to 12.4% for ACT public sector workers. Even going back 10 years, ACT public sector workers have had lower pay rises than that of private sector workers across the country \u2013 34.9% compared to 36.2%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wages annual growth - ACT public servants &amp; the private sector\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ny6nu/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The slowing growth of wages across the country is being driven by a couple of factors. Firstly, the mining industry is massively off the boil.</p> <p>For just over 10 years from the middle of 2004, wages in the mining sector grew faster than everywhere else. But this situation reversed in the middle of last year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wages growth - mining versus the rest\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2j7LH/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> And it wasn\u2019t just that workers in the mining sector during the boom years were on average getting better pay raises than everyone else, they were also the source of the biggest pay rises.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/6345.0Feature%20Article1Sep%202016?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=6345.0&amp;issue=Sep%202016&amp;num=&amp;view=\">review of 18,000 different jobs</a> by the RBA and the ABS found that in 2012, over 60% of mining sector pay rises were greater than 4% per annum; now it is less than 10%.</p> <p>Such falls in the proportion of above average wage rises has occurred across all industries, and so too has the size of those large wage rises. In 2012 the average of wage rises above 4% was 7.5%, now it is 5.75%.</p> <p>The biggest wage rises over the past year have come in the education and healthcare industries, and also rather surprisingly, the accommodation and food industry.</p> <p>This is a surprise because, as a general rule, that industry usually sees the worst wages growth. Over the past 10 years, wages in that industry have increased just 31.6%, well below the national average of 37.1%.</p> <p>A main driver of the increase in that industry is the <a href=\"https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/news-and-media-releases/website-news/get-set-for-a-2-4-wage-increase-2016-annual-wage-review\">2.4% increase in the minimum wage</a> handed down by the Fair Work Commission that came into effect on 1 July.</p> <p>By contrast the mining sector is currently the worst performing industry for wage rises, and yet over the past 10 years it has been the best. But given in the past four years its workforce has shrunk by 20%, it is doubtful there are many workers who have been around for the full 10 years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wage growth by industry\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UeQpO/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> All up, the poor wages growth means that real wages continue to be flat.</p> <p>When comparing wage growth to the RBA\u2019s underlying inflation measure, real wages haven\u2019t grown by any appreciable level for three years. They have done better when compared to the employee cost of living index, but this is mostly due to the impact of interest rate cuts, and as result can be a rather erratic measure:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Real annual wages growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cjMII/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> Since 2002, real wages have gone through four stages \u2013 the mining-boom, the GFC-flatness, the post-GFC improvement, and then the now three year run of near stagnation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Real wages since 2002\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0IkAi/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> As the US political system has shown, when real incomes stay flat, voters get angry.

      "bodyText": "One in three working families struggle to pay their energy bills, it has been claimed, as pressure mounts on suppliers to do more to help poorer households move on to the cheapest deals. Twenty-nine per cent of families do not put on the heating even when the house is cold, said comparison website uSwitch, while two-thirds fear cutting their energy use to save money will affect their family\u2019s health. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that even families in work are struggling to pay their energy bills,\u201d said uSwitch\u2019s energy expert, Claire Osborne. \u201cSuppliers must play their part by doing all they can to help their customers move to their best deal.\u201d The energy regulator, Ofgem, backed calls for suppliers to alert customers to cost-saving schemes such as the warm home discount (WHD). The initiative forces firms with more than 250,000 customers to offer a \u00a3140 discount to low-income pensioners and other vulnerable groups, though it has been criticised for long delays in delivering the reduction. \u201cWe want suppliers to engage more actively with customers, particularly those on standard variable tariffs, to help them get a better deal,\u201d said an Ofgem spokesperson. This week the business minister criticised energy companies amid claims they were profiteering from deals that do not offer good value. \u201cCustomers who are loyal to their energy supplier should be treated well, not taken for a ride, and it\u2019s high time the big companies recognised this,\u201d Greg Clark said. \u201cI have made clear to the big firms that this can\u2019t go on and they must treat customers properly or be made to do so.\u201d Responding to the uSwitch survey, a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThis government is on the side of energy customers and providing vital support for people in our community who need it most. \u201cWe continue to support the warm home discount scheme \u2026 and are refocusing the \u2018energy company obligation\u2019 [a government energy efficiency measure] so it effectively tackles the cause of fuel poverty.\u201d But the energy company First Utility accused the big six suppliers \u2013 British Gas, E.ON, npower, SSE, Scottish Power and EDF Energy \u2013 of undermining the WHD scheme. It said 70% of people who get the discount are on expensive standard variable tariffs (SVTs) and are often unaware their supplier offers cheaper deals. First Utility estimated that 1.5 million vulnerable customers were overpaying by \u00a3440m a year, or \u00a3300 per household, more than wiping out their WHD benefit. \u201cThis means the \u00a3140 WHD payment goes straight back into the big six\u2019s coffers,\u201d said the firm, adding that customers were being \u201choodwinked\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s plain wrong that the poorest and most vulnerable are being charged over the odds for their energy,\u201d said First Utility\u2019s chief executive, Ed Kamm. \u201cWe want the government to stop the big six energy companies from taking advantage of the [WHD] scheme at the expense of struggling families.\u201d Labour MP Frank Field, who is backing First Utility\u2019s campaign, has written to Theresa May urging her to protect the \u201cvulnerable underbelly of British society\u201d, after she highlighted energy costs in her speech at the Conservative party conference. But one industry insider cast doubt on the wisdom of Field\u2019s suggestion. \u201cIt\u2019s simple A-level maths. What happens if everyone goes on the lowest tariff? The lowest tariff goes up.\u201d British Gas said: \u201cNo energy company does more than us to help vulnerable customers, and that included paying the warm home discount as soon as possible to hundreds of thousands of customers. \u201cWe regularly tell our customers if they could switch to a cheaper tariff and thousands of them do. This includes many customers who qualify for the warm home discount.\u201d But Scottish Power, another big six firm, said it was aware that not enough of the poorest customers were on the cheapest deals and was taking steps to address this. \u201cWe have already identified that more can be done to help warm home discount customers, and we are finalising our plans to take action this winter.\u201d",
