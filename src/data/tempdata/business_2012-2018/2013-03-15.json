      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King has warned the Treasury against watering down the commitment to low inflation in the budget next week, describing a return to high inflation as \"scary\". King, who leaves office in June, rejected calls for the central bank to put forward more aggressive policies to boost growth at the expense of its current focus on inflation. \"I'm not sure there is any call for major change in the remit,\" he told ITV News. \"Most important is the commitment to the target of 2% [inflation].\" The inflation target, which was set by the Treasury in the 1990s, is under threat following months of criticism directed at Threadneedle Street for the weak pace of economic recovery. King's rare television interview came amid speculation that the chancellor will tell parliament next week in his budget that a review of the Bank of England's mandate is needed to include a requirement to focus on economic growth. The governor is thought to have lobbied against the move and told ITV: \"What was scary when we had high inflation was businesses faced high interest rates \u2026 mortgage repayments doubled, there was pressure on household finances \u2026 people stopped looking at the long term and focused entirely on the short term.\" Earlier, chief economist Spencer Dale had given a speech where he too endorsed the Bank's mandate and said the inflation target still allowed it to take an active approach to boosting growth. In what appeared to be a co-ordinated attack on the chancellor's plans, Dale described calls for policies to promote growth as \"dangerous talk\". \"The target is not a sham, but a vital anchor,\" he said. \"We will hit the inflation target. And if we don't hit the inflation target over time, the cost to our economy will be very severe.\" The Bank has pumped \u00a3375bn into the economy by quantitative easing, mainly through banks and building societies, in an effort to boost lending. A separate \u00a380bn scheme subsidises loans to banks. Figures for last year show that much of the money was used by banks to bolster reserves rather than lent to households and small businesses. But King reiterated his view that there is a case for more electronic printing of money. The Bank has failed to meet the 2% target for more than three years but blamed items such as the rise in university tuition fees. Dale also argued against boosting the economy with more central bank loans, arguing that it would trigger inflation. Markets responded by reversing a three-month decline in the value of the pound, which bounced back to $1.51. Sterling has declined by more than 7% since the beginning of the year in response to speculation that the central bank will inject further funds into the economy to boost growth. Constrained by his focus on debt repayments, Osborne has come to rely on King expanding the funds he puts into the economy to support bank lending to households and small businesses. The governor will be replaced by Mark Carney in the summer and it is understood the Canadian central bank chief is keen to adopt a broader range of measures to kickstart the ailing economy.",

      "standfirst": "The JP Morgan debacle was not a momentary lapse. It was an issue of culture \u2013 and it reflects badly on its charismatic CEO", 
      "body": "<p>You could tell the exact moment when Ina Drew decided she had nothing left to lose.</p> <p>Drew, who ran JP Morgan's $350bn investment office, testified in front of the Senate today about the infamous London Whale trading debacle that racked up $6.2bn in losses for JP Morgan last year. She began her testimony by recounting her decades at JP Morgan \"through seven mergers,\" talked about managing her job and her kids in a search for work-life balance, and gave credit to the \"great CEOs\" she had worked under, including current chief executive Jamie Dimon.</p> <p>But Drew did not step up to take responsibility herself. She talked of trusting her deputies. She insisted that JP Morgan had provided its regulators with a daily account of the profits and losses in the bank's investment office \u2013 despite Senate documentation to the contrary and the testimony of a regulator who later directly said she was wrong, and that the bank only provided the daily account after the whole debacle blew up in May. When Drew was asked if she knew one key and obvious fact \u2013 whether JP Morgan had skipped a crucial yearly check on its trading limits \u2013 she demurred that she couldn't recall.</p> <p>Drew, however, was one of the villains in the bank's own account of what went wrong, and you could see the pressure building up in her mind as she declined to answer, paused, or claimed lack of recall. She ran the office that racked up the losses, and according to the Senate report, she applauded traders for risky bets on American Airlines.</p> <p>She told investigators that when her traders complained that the Whale trade was getting too huge to manage, \"she never read the email\". She never went to bat for Bruno Iksil, the head trader who openly complained the bank was playing with fire and taking \"idiotic\" steps to misreport its losses.</p> <p>No other executive said anything remotely designed to exculpate her. Michael Cavanagh, the JP Morgan executive who conducted the bank's internal investigation, opened his testimony by proudly noting that the bank had engaged in \"introspection\" and was \"determined to be a better company because of this experience\". With a confident voice, he noted that the bank had thrown out the bad apples \u2013 it had either fired or \"accepted the resignations\" of the people \"responsible\" for the bad trades. That resignation he was referring to was Drew's.</p> <p>And so, minutes later, Drew gave a rare direct response. Carl Levin, the chair of the subcommittee on investigations, asked her about an incident in which she collared a bank regulator who was getting too nosy and \"sternly\" told him that Dimon knew about all the investment decisions in her group. Levin pressed on this: was Dimon \u2013 the \"great CEO\" she mentioned \u2013 informed throughout about what happened in her office, under her purview? Drew looked directly at Levin, pulled some strength into her thin voice, and gave the answer: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>This was the most surprising moment in the entire London Whale debacle, and it will cause Dimon no end of trouble.</p> <p>Dimon, the charismatic leader of the bank, had enjoyed a reputation as a tough, strict taskmaster, the kind of CEO every bank should have. While Vikram Pandit at Citigroup was seen as hapless, and mischievous Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs seen as flip, Dimon was the exception, the statesman of the financial sector. <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2009/07/the_canonization_of_jamie_dimo.html\">He was Good King Jamie</a>. Even in Dimon's blustery moments, he enjoyed a reputation as one of the saviors of the financial system, the guy who ran the one bank strong enough to absorb both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.</p> <p>So as far as the London Whale debacle went, it had never seriously gone up to the executive office before now. Dimon's bonus was cut last year \u2013 to $11.5m \u2013 but that was seen as a gesture, a way to show shared sacrifice and compunction as the bank tried to show it had cleaned up its act. It showed that Dimon was willing to take the pain like everyone else.</p> <p>His chief financial officer, Doug Braunstein, also had his bonus cut in half. Others were fired. Some had their yearly bonuses \"clawed back\" by the bank.</p> <p>Dimon's testimony last year in front of the Senate was embarrassingly friendly, with Senators showing open admiration and even asking him to help them write regulation for banks. JP Morgan went on to write a self-flagellating public report about the London Whale debacle, slapping itself for being sloppy and stupid. It admitted its faults time and time again. It co-operated with Senate investigators and appeared to actually tell the truth. This was a good showing for a bank. Most banks react to crisis with furtiveness. Jamie Dimon, in this whole disaster, had nothing to be afraid of \u2013 and he showed it.</p> <p>Dimon himself has always maintained that he knew very little about the way the London Whale trade metastasized. He did testify last year that he knew losses were increasing, but he pleaded ignorance to the details. He said he trusted his deputies \u2013 including Drew \u2013 to tell him when problems were occurring, and that he believed them when he said they were \"comfortable\".</p> <p>Drew's testimony this morning was the first real hole in this armor. It was to be followed by others. The Senate subcommittee on investigations had handed in a damning report, true. It indicated that Dimon knew as early as January 2012 that JP Morgan had breached its risk limits, and that he had personally approved raising them.</p> <p>But the most damning moment of the hearing happened after lunch, when everyone was probably pretty sleepy and not paying much attention. Senator Levin asked a bank regulator with the OCC what had happened, how the regulator stopped getting information. The regulator said JP Morgan had stopped sending daily reports in August 2011. The OCC objected, and met with Dimon as well as CFO Doug Braunstein. At this meeting, the regulator said, Dimon said the bank was afraid of leaks, and that it was changing how it was distributing its information.</p> <p>Dimon allegedly hammered the OCC regulator on why he needed the information \u2013 which, at that time, was standard and expected information for the regulator to have. \"As Mr Dimon said: why we weren't going to get it?\" the regulator recalled. Braunstein said he had already sent the reports. Dimon turned on Braunstein, the regulator remembered. \"Mr Dimon said it was <em>his</em> decision whether to send the reports to the OCC.\" </p> <p>\"Did he raise his voice?\" Levin asked.</p> <p>\"He did,\" the regulator replied. </p> <p>This moment was damning, as damning as Ina Drew's moment of truth earlier. It showed the pattern of bullying that JP Morgan showed towards its own regulator, and that Dimon himself had a hand in it. He prevented a bank regulator from getting necessary information, and, according to the testimony, personally kept that information out of the regulator's hands in August 2011.</p> <p>Levin also pointed out that the bank misinformed the OCC on losses \u2013 at times, telling the regulator that the bank was losing only $580m on the risky trades when JP Morgan's own internal numbers showed a loss of $1.2bn. It was compounded because since last year, Dimon and Braunstein had both said the bank's regulators were fully informed \u2013 which, as we now know, they were not. (On the stand, Braunstein, his mouth firmly set into a downward-facing crescent, denied remembering the incident at all.)</p> <p>The upshot is that the Senate report and the hearing show that JP Morgan treated its regulators high-handedly. You might expect this of other banks, but JP Morgan was supposed to be the exception. It was not, however, the exception. Faced with deepening losses, it reacted the way any other bank would: with increasing panic, bad decision-making, and attempts to either erase the loss through more gambling or cover it up by publicly minimized the impact. JP Morgan showed it was sorry, but it also had a lot to be sorry for. </p> <p>More importantly, this bullying, this panic, this misleading of regulators and the public, reflected badly on its popular, charismatic CEO. JP Morgan is too old and storied to be The House That Dimon Built. But Dimon was seen as the capable steward, the principled stalwart against bad behavior. It changes the narrative significantly to see that he had engaged in bad behavior himself.</p> <p>Dimon \u2013 and JP Morgan \u2013 have shown a lot of compunction. It's clear they are embarrassed by the London Whale debacle. But it is embarrassed for the wrong reasons. JP Morgan has indicated that it believes it got the facts wrong, that a group of people screwed up and those people are gone, and now the bank can go about its moral, principled way. The bank has repeatedly made it clear that a big loss \u2013 even of $6.2bn \u2013 cannot take down a bank with the size and strength of JP Morgan \u2013 a bank that has, in its own favorite phrase, \"a fortress balance sheet\".</p> <p>But this is not a math problem. This is an issue of culture. It's an issue of hubris, and lack of humility. What happened in the London Whale debacle was not an oversight of a single moment. It was days, weeks, and months of bad, entitled behavior. A few weeks ago, Dimon \u2013 resplendent, the picture of wealth in a fashionably cut black suit, snowy white shirt collar and cuffs and a trim haircut \u2013 lightly mocked an analyst who asked about how the bank compared to its rivals. Dimon made it clear that it didn't compare, that it would be a dumb decision to, say, move your money from JP Morgan to UBS. He followed by telling the analyst, \"that's why I'm richer than you\". I was in the room, and the comment played like fun sparring - the analyst was trying to get a rise from Dimon, and Dimon was showing that he was willing to play the game of wits.</p> <p>But this may be a good time for Dimon to be aware that sometimes, a CEO can come on too strong, that command-and-control has its responsibilities as well as its advantages, that humility and transparency are also virtues of leadership. Levin put it best at the end of JP Morgan's testimony today, in his folksy Michigan way, when he this to the executive: \"You folks have indicated that you've taken steps to clean up that act. I hope that's true.\"</p> <p>If Dimon is to restore his reputation, he has to make that effort to change true of him as well as of his bank.</p>",

But the most damning moment of the hearing happened after lunch, when everyone was probably pretty sleepy and not paying much attention. Senator Levin asked a bank regulator with the OCC what had happened, how the regulator stopped getting information. The regulator said JP Morgan had stopped sending daily reports in August 2011. The OCC objected, and met with Dimon as well as CFO Doug Braunstein. At this meeting, the regulator said, Dimon said the bank was afraid of leaks, and that it was changing how it was distributing its information. Dimon allegedly hammered the OCC regulator on why he needed the information \u2013 which, at that time, was standard and expected information for the regulator to have. \"As Mr Dimon said: why we weren't going to get it?\" the regulator recalled. Braunstein said he had already sent the reports. Dimon turned on Braunstein, the regulator remembered. \"Mr Dimon said it was his decision whether to send the reports to the OCC.\" \"Did he raise his voice?\" Levin asked. \"He did,\" the regulator replied. This moment was damning, as damning as Ina Drew's moment of truth earlier. It showed the pattern of bullying that JP Morgan showed towards its own regulator, and that Dimon himself had a hand in it. He prevented a bank regulator from getting necessary information, and, according to the testimony, personally kept that information out of the regulator's hands in August 2011. Levin also pointed out that the bank misinformed the OCC on losses \u2013 at times, telling the regulator that the bank was losing only $580m on the risky trades when JP Morgan's own internal numbers showed a loss of $1.2bn. It was compounded because since last year, Dimon and Braunstein had both said the bank's regulators were fully informed \u2013 which, as we now know, they were not. (On the stand, Braunstein, his mouth firmly set into a downward-facing crescent, denied remembering the incident at all.) The upshot is that the Senate report and the hearing show that JP Morgan treated its regulators high-handedly. You might expect this of other banks, but JP Morgan was supposed to be the exception. It was not, however, the exception. Faced with deepening losses, it reacted the way any other bank would: with increasing panic, bad decision-making, and attempts to either erase the loss through more gambling or cover it up by publicly minimized the impact. JP Morgan showed it was sorry, but it also had a lot to be sorry for. More importantly, this bullying, this panic, this misleading of regulators and the public, reflected badly on its popular, charismatic CEO. JP Morgan is too old and storied to be The House That Dimon Built. But Dimon was seen as the capable steward, the principled stalwart against bad behavior. It changes the narrative significantly to see that he had engaged in bad behavior himself. Dimon \u2013 and JP Morgan \u2013 have shown a lot of compunction. It's clear they are embarrassed by the London Whale debacle. But it is embarrassed for the wrong reasons. JP Morgan has indicated that it believes it got the facts wrong, that a group of people screwed up and those people are gone, and now the bank can go about its moral, principled way. The bank has repeatedly made it clear that a big loss \u2013 even of $6.2bn \u2013 cannot take down a bank with the size and strength of JP Morgan \u2013 a bank that has, in its own favorite phrase, \"a fortress balance sheet\". But this is not a math problem. This is an issue of culture. It's an issue of hubris, and lack of humility. What happened in the London Whale debacle was not an oversight of a single moment. It was days, weeks, and months of bad, entitled behavior. A few weeks ago, Dimon \u2013 resplendent, the picture of wealth in a fashionably cut black suit, snowy white shirt collar and cuffs and a trim haircut \u2013 lightly mocked an analyst who asked about how the bank compared to its rivals. Dimon made it clear that it didn't compare, that it would be a dumb decision to, say, move your money from JP Morgan to UBS. He followed by telling the analyst, \"that's why I'm richer than you\". I was in the room, and the comment played like fun sparring - the analyst was trying to get a rise from Dimon, and Dimon was showing that he was willing to play the game of wits. But this may be a good time for Dimon to be aware that sometimes, a CEO can come on too strong, that command-and-control has its responsibilities as well as its advantages, that humility and transparency are also virtues of leadership. Levin put it best at the end of JP Morgan's testimony today, in his folksy Michigan way, when he this to the executive: \"You folks have indicated that you've taken steps to clean up that act. I hope that's true.\" If Dimon is to restore his reputation, he has to make that effort to change true of him as well as of his bank.",

For six hours he grilled bank executives and former executives, and then regulators, about what went wrong, that the bank could accumulate $6.2bn in losses on one trading desk with seemingly no internal or external oversight.</p> <p>It emerged that <strong>JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon</strong> had a hands-on role in how trading information was reported to the government and what information was reported. Today's testimony seemed to implicate Dimon as never before in activities inside the bank to keep its losses secret and maintain calm with investors.</p> <p><strong>Levin made the case</strong> for the charges he brought in his opening statement: \"A massive derivatives portfolio riddled with risk. A runaway train of derivatives trading blowing through risk limits. Hidden losses. Bank executives downplaying the bad bets. Regulators who failed to act.\"</p> <p>The risk, Levin says, is that the bank doesn't fix its <strong>bad practices</strong>, that it incurs a future loss of even more money and that the government comes under pressure to intervene with taxpayer money. That's unacceptable to the public, Levin said.</p> <p><strong>Ina Drew,</strong> the former chief investment officer who lost her job in the scandal, was obfuscatory on what she did and didn't know about the bank's reporting bad numbers to regulators (at one point Drew passed on a losses figure, $580m, that was about half the figure the bank had published in an internal report days earlier, $1.2bn). Likewise,<strong> Doug Braunstein, the bank's vice chairman,</strong> insisted that the bank was handing over daily, detailed information to regulators - when regulators said it had not. <strong>JPMorgan's co-CEO, Michael Cavanagh,</strong> at first said it was a \"coincidence\" that the bank had changed its accounting practices as losses began to mount; then he admitted that it looked like there had been an attempt to cover up the losses.</p> <p>The upshot was a demonstration of seeming disregard inside JPMorgan for its own institutional health, a habit of stonewalling the government and an attitude of disdain for investors. Executives at the bank insisted they had taken <strong>steps to make things right</strong>, by firing some people and demoting others, and by instituting new guidelines for reporting on trades and new limits on risk.</p> <p>As Levin concluded, \"we've seen today a very disturbing picture.\"</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T20:27:50.493Z\">at 8.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5143796eb5799f28f712f763\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T19:41:34.916Z\">7.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Levin thanks the witnesses.</p> <p>\"We've seen today <strong>a very disturbing picture</strong>, which raises questions not just about JP Morgan but about derivatives in general.</p> <p>The OCC has already lowered JP Morgan's management rating.</p> <p>\"Mr. Curry, I believe you have a challenge to get AMerica's biggest bank back on the straight and narrow.\"</p> <p>\"We stand adjourned.\"</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-514378fcb5799f28f712f761\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-15T19:39:41.631Z\">7.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Levin is making<strong> recommendations to the regulators.</strong></p> <p>Levin: Mr Curry, you took office just as the whale trades broke.

      "bodyText": "We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage of today's Senate hearing on trading and reporting practices at JPMorgan. It was a tour de force for Senator Carl Levin of Michigan. For six hours he grilled bank executives and former executives, and then regulators, about what went wrong, that the bank could accumulate $6.2bn in losses on one trading desk with seemingly no internal or external oversight. It emerged that JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon had a hands-on role in how trading information was reported to the government and what information was reported. Today's testimony seemed to implicate Dimon as never before in activities inside the bank to keep its losses secret and maintain calm with investors. Levin made the case for the charges he brought in his opening statement: \"A massive derivatives portfolio riddled with risk. A runaway train of derivatives trading blowing through risk limits. Hidden losses. Bank executives downplaying the bad bets. Regulators who failed to act.\" The risk, Levin says, is that the bank doesn't fix its bad practices, that it incurs a future loss of even more money and that the government comes under pressure to intervene with taxpayer money. That's unacceptable to the public, Levin said. Ina Drew, the former chief investment officer who lost her job in the scandal, was obfuscatory on what she did and didn't know about the bank's reporting bad numbers to regulators (at one point Drew passed on a losses figure, $580m, that was about half the figure the bank had published in an internal report days earlier, $1.2bn). Likewise, Doug Braunstein, the bank's vice chairman, insisted that the bank was handing over daily, detailed information to regulators - when regulators said it had not. JPMorgan's co-CEO, Michael Cavanagh, at first said it was a \"coincidence\" that the bank had changed its accounting practices as losses began to mount; then he admitted that it looked like there had been an attempt to cover up the losses. The upshot was a demonstration of seeming disregard inside JPMorgan for its own institutional health, a habit of stonewalling the government and an attitude of disdain for investors. Executives at the bank insisted they had taken steps to make things right, by firing some people and demoting others, and by instituting new guidelines for reporting on trades and new limits on risk. As Levin concluded, \"we've seen today a very disturbing picture.\" Levin thanks the witnesses. \"We've seen today a very disturbing picture, which raises questions not just about JP Morgan but about derivatives in general. The OCC has already lowered JP Morgan's management rating. \"Mr. Curry, I believe you have a challenge to get AMerica's biggest bank back on the straight and narrow.\" \"We stand adjourned.\" Levin is making recommendations to the regulators. Levin: Mr Curry, you took office just as the whale trades broke. Were you surprised? Curry: \"I was certainly taken aback - at how serious and complex the situation was.\" Levin asks Curry about beefing up bank oversight. \"This is an area where we need to do considerably more work,\" Curry says. The comptroller has found \"safety and soundness problems\" throughout the bank, Curry says. Levin: \"Is it not obvious what was happening here, that these prices were being changed in order to reduce the losses on the books?\" Waterhouse: \"It appears so, yes sir.\" Levin: Is that not a troubling set of facts? Mr. Curry? Curry: Yes it is, senator. Levin has been asking why regulators didn't investigate much when the bank changed its model for assessing the value of assets at risk. Mostly Levin talking. Not much testimony in this section. The bank reported to the government hundreds of SCP risk-limit breaches in the first four months of 2012, Levin said. The breaches went from six (6) in the last quarter of 2011 to 170 in the first quarter of 2012 and 160 in April alone. Levin to Waterhouse: didn't you notice this? Waterhouse: We were more concerned about the investment bank. We did not pursue those as we should have. The government guys are way better at self-lacerating admissions of screw-ups than the bankers are. The impression is that JPMorgan treated the government like a bunch of chumps who would take what scraps of info they could get - and thank the bank profusely for it. Curry, the currency comptroller, said it is an \"unacceptable premise that the bank decides what is given to the OCC and our examiners.\": Levin: So it's not up to Dimon to decide. Waterhouse is describing how Dimon \"expressed his dismay\" that JPMorgan had resumed sending detailed trading reports to the OCC. Levin asks whether Dimon was personally involved in deciding what information the bank gave the government. Levin: He had decided to stop the reports? Waterhouse: I took it that way. L: So he was the one to stop the flow? W: I took it that way. L: And did he raise his voice? W: He did. Waterhouse directly contradicts the testimony of Drew, and what the bank told investors at the time, that as far as anyone knew, JP Morgan was sending regulators daily reports on its trading activity, including the synthetic credit portfolio traded by the London Whale. \"We were not getting daily P&amp;L reports on the SCP portfolio at that time,\" Waterhouse says, referring to the spring of 2012. He says they started getting detailed reports in May, after \"the whole thing blew up.\" Levin is now taking testimony from Scott Waterhouse, an OCC examiner. In January 2012, the John Wilmot of JP Morgan's CIO office met with the OCC. Wilmot told the OCC that mark-to-market book is decreasing in size in 2012. Was that the case, Levin asks. \"Absolutely not,\" Waterhouse says. \"It mushroomed. It ballooned.\" There's going to be a 20-minute break, and then we'll hear from panel 3, the regulators: THE HONORABLE THOMAS J. CURRY Comptroller of the Currency U. S.

Next up: the regulators. \"You folks have testified here that you've taken some steps to clean up that act,\" Levin says. \"I hope that that's true. The public deserves it. The economy requires it. \"I want to end on a thank you to you folks for being here without requiring subpoenas. \"We're highly critical of these activities and appropriately so, but at least the bank has been cooperative in these efforts and for that we're thankful. \"You're excused.\" Senator Carl Levin: killing it. Levin is quoting a phone call between a risk modeler and Peter Weiland, former head of market risk. The modeler, called Hagan, at one point suggests changing the model to \"optimize regulatory capital\" - which could be taken to mean hiding losses from regulators. Weiland told Hagan not to put that in an email. Levin implies this was a cover up. Weiland says he was just trying to avoid confusion. \"Mr Hagan, in his role as a mathematician... was focused too much on his own mathematical interest in optimizing it,\" Weiland says. Levin dismisses the explanation, pointing out that Weiland seemed most concerned about the email trail, not the possible attempt on the part of his mathematician to dupe regulators. \"You don't say that's not how we do it at this bank...\"You say this is a sensitive subject, don't put it in emails. Right?\" Weiland: \"Right.\" Levin now is digging into the question of whether the bank changed its models for measuring risk in order to allow it to take more risk. Braunstein claims his call with investors on April 13, in which he said the bank was reporting all its positions to regulators and had a handle on the London Whale losse, was \"an accurate presentation.\" Levin says Braunstein had failed on the call to disclose that the SCP violated all five risk limits for months. \"Honestly now, you think that's a balanced presentation?\" Levin says. Braunstein says in hindsight, based on what they learned... Levin points out that the bank had all the information at the time. Braunstein doesn't really have an answer. Levin basically tells Braunstein he's full of it. \"I got a lotta trouble believing those statements were anything other than an effort to calm the seas,\" Levin says. Levin is challenging Braunstein on his prior statement - during a call with investors on April 13, 2012- that all of the bank's trading positions are fully transparent to the regulators. There's no regular report to the OCC on the synthetic credit portfolio, Levin says. \"Are you saying these positions were reported to the OCC?\" \"I believed it to be accurate, based on [info] I received from Ms. Drew and the traders,\" Braunstein says. Do you know why those reports were suddenly not sent, January through April? Do you know why? Braunstein: \"Yes... We changed our reports and unfortunately an error was made... we were not aware the OCC was not getting it. I believed we were being fully transparent.\" Levin asks him if he really believed the OCC got regular information on the trading positions. Levin: \"You know it's not true now, right? You lost billions of dollars and you're representing to the public that the regulators got information on those positions on a regular basis??\" Braunstein is really sweating. \"The specific positions they received... I was aware they received positions on the specifics on the 10th... Levin goes in for the kill: \"Did they get the information on the Whale trade positions as part of normalized reporting?\" Braunstein is trapped: \"They did not get the detailed information regularly.\" Levin points out that directly contradicts what he told the public and the government after the Whale scandal came to light. Totally explodes the bank's credibility, in this incident. Levin reads a Drew note saying data that would \"tweak\" the marks would be \"helpful.\" The impression is of Drew getting involved with accounting that is changing on the fly at a time when the bank is dealing with a scary and ballooning loss. Drew tries to explain: \"I had been told for a long period of time that the remarks were very conservative... I was challenging him to show with data that if he can possibly wants to show that the market's turning.\" Levin: You used the word \"help.\" Drew: \"Only with demonstrable data.\" Levin: \"But you used the word helpful. Right?... Tweaking is not a prediction or a hope, by the way, tweaking is changing something. And I hope the guidance that you would give would be against tweaking.\" \"The suggestion was that he tweak something to make the numbers look better.\" Levin is single-handedly handing JP Morgan its hat. Fireworks now between Levin and Cavanagh, the co-CEO, Cavanagh ran a review task force. Levin: How do you possibly justify changing your process in making your marks in order to make your losses be less? Cavanagh: The belief was that the market was more volatile given the press coverage and knowledge of the Whale positions. \"It wasn't a change in the policy, it was a change of the outcome of that policy.\" Levin: Was it a coincidence that the changing in market process made the losses look better? Cavanagh: \"I wouldn't say it was a coincidence. It was what happened.\" Levin: Was it a coincidence? At the time the losses were piling up. You changed your accounting practices. That was a coincidence? A: Yes. Q: Absolutely no intent on the part of the people that were involved to hide losses? Levin reminds Cavanagh he's under oath. Cavanagh seems a bit concerned, and changes his approach. A: I clearly know now, having done the review, that the people ultimately were mismarking, were not properly marking their books, from the middle of march to the end of March.\" Levin: Their marking was changed in order to reduce the loss on the books? A: Yes. Q: That's the reason it was done? A: Yes. Q: You were saying before it was a coincidence. Now you're saying it's not a coincidence. Cavanagh hems and haws. Guardian US finance and economics editor Heidi N. Moore sees a tough day for JP Morgan. It's a rare and riveting hearing we're seeing, she writes. Levin is drawing blood. McCain: Aside from the traders who mis-marked the book, has anyone been held accountable for breaching the risk limits? Braunstein, the bank's vice chairman, says he concurs with the report that there were a number of mistakes made. McCain asks what the punishments were. Braunstein says people--not just traders - were fired. Others got pay cuts. Including you? McCain says. Yes, Braunstein says. He took an \"approximately 50% cut.\" McCain forces him to name a dollar amount. \"I moved from $9.5m in 2011 to $5m in 2012.\" *whistles* A hard question from Levin to Drew: Why did you tell the OCC the losses were $580m in April when the Friday before your meeting with the OCC an internal report showed $1.2bn in losses? Why not give the real number, Levin asks. Drew implies she didn't turn over the number... because regulators already had the numbers. \"The OCC to the best of my knowledge had profit and loss daily reports... of the CIO's activities,\" Drew says. Levin is disbelieving. Daily profit and losses, including for the synthetic credit portfolio? Yup, Drew says. Levin thinks that's preposterous. \"I think you're inaccurate about this but we'll find out from the OCC.\" Earlier, Drew said she reported \"the number that I believed was accurate.\" \"The number I reported was the number that was given to me by central risk and finance. \"I knew that number to be the correct number.\" If you haven't read Heidi Moore's explainer on the London Whale scandal (published May 2012, before the extent of the losses became known), you can find it here. Here's the top: All I know is that everyone's really mad about this JP Morgan mess. What on earth happened? A JP Morgan trader, Bruno Iksil, has been accumulating a giant bet on U.S. corporate bonds. He used derivatives to do it, and he messed up the bet and lost $2 billion for the bank. He could end up losing $1 billion more if the market doesn't cooperate. Iksil was so powerful - and his bet was so large - that other traders nicknamed him the London Whale. Is this one of those \"rogue traders\" I keep hearing about? No, Iksil worked for JP Morgan and had the full support of the bank and did all his trades with the full knowledge of these four Very Important People at the top. How did no one know about this? Oh, they did. Everyone knew. Thousands of people. Iksil's bets have been well known ever since Bloomberg's Stephanie Ruhle broke the news in early April. A trader at rival bank Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote to clients back then, saying that Iksil's huge bet was attracting attention and hedge funds believed him to be too optimistic and were betting against him, waiting for Iksil to crash. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Merrill Lynch trader wrote, \"Fast money has smelt blood.\" When the media, analysts and other traders raised concerns on JP Morgan's earnings conference call last month, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon dismissed their worries as \"a tempest in a teapot.\" Carl Levin and John McCain are carrying the torch for the entire government on this. Where are all the other senators? Cavanagh says the bank has learned \"hard lessons.\" He says there has been \"substantial and healthy introspection at the senior management level of our firm.\" How reassuring. The first step Cavanagh mentions that the firm has taken to fix the mess: We fired Ina Drew. (He doesn't name her, referring to investment officers.) Panel 2 is up: MICHAEL J. CAVANAGH Co-Chief Executive Officer - Corporate &amp; Investment BankJPMorgan Chase Bank NANew York, NYDownload Testimony (626.6 KB) DOUGLAS L. BRAUNSTEIN Current Vice ChairmanJPMorgan Chase Bank NANew York, NY Cavanagh is leading the bank's review of the Whale episode. \"Some of what we found is frankly disappointing, and does not reflect our institution at its best,\" he says. Drew is asked why the risk team didn't raise an alarm. \"It's very disappointing,\" she says. \"I have no idea. The risk group is an independent group staffed by well-trained and educated PhDs... I'm disappointed it was not handled properly.\" Levin says the supposed risk limits were hollow, fake, ignored, meaningless. No one on the panel is disagreeing with him. Levin asks Bacon why anyone should believe that new risk limits would work, given the apparent culture of disregard within the bank for the limits. Bacon says there are new \"policies and procedures\" whereby if a risk limit breach happens, it automatically goes all the way to the top, all the way to Dimon. Drew says she was aware of the four-month breach of the risk limit, but she accepted the explanation that the problem was with an obsolete limit, not with the breach. \"I was told by risk that it was not a useful limit and that it was going to be replaced by a more useful limit.\" But then Drew professes ignorance of one of the risk limits that had been breached. \"I didn't know there was a global CSBP limit.\" Levin asks Drew if she was aware that the risk limit had not been reviewed, despite supposed mandatory annual review. She can't recall. Overwhelming impression is that the bank, even the executives specifically in charge of risk oversight, wasn't too worried about the rulebook. No one seems to have known what the rules were, or worried about breaking them or maintaining them. Drew was the chief investment officer, but certain investment positions - like one threatening, on paper, to eat up nearly a billion dollars - were supposedly under her radar: There's a strangely sedated mood to this hearing. The bankers are speaking haltingly, repeatedly pulling up short. The effect is to communicate an eerie ignorance. There's the sense that there's a lot they're not saying. McCain is grilling Bacon, the current risk guy. Q: \"There are firm-wide risk limits at JPM, is that true?\" A: Yes. Q: Were those breaches ignored? A: \"It was not ignored. It caused action and escalation. It was a situation where we replied upon an explanation, that turned out to be wrong, about the new VAR model. Reliance was erroneously placed on that. Q: Let me tell you what's hard to explain to my constituents. How could we possibly balloon up to a $6bn loss? ... And it seemed that the traders seemed to have more responsibility than the higher up executives? You tell me what I'm supposed to tell my constituents, when their tax dollars insured this kind of gambling. A: \"We need to be clear that this whole thing was unacceptable,\" Bacon says. \"This failed because of multiple things that should have caught it did not catch it.\" He mentions management oversight on the ground in London, and limits on risk. \"It would actually have been easy to catch this, in many ways. ... It didn't happen.\" Drew explains how the losses got out of control, beyond the ability of the bank's internal overseers to reign in. \"The plan as signed off by all senior management including myself was to reduce the RWA (risk-weighted asset) over the total of 2012.\" She says there was to have been a rapid reduction from the second quarter forward. \"Things went terribly wrong, as we all know.\" McCain: Was it your responsibility to disclose the losses to the OCC? Drew says no. McCain asks Weiland: Whose job was it to enforce the risk limits? In a preliminary report to the committee, Weiland disclaimed responsibility. Now he backtracks. \"It clearly was part of my job,\" he says. McCain lays into Weiland. McCain doesn't believe that Weiland doesn't know who was responsible for sending the reports to regulators. \"But you don't who that individual might have been?\" \"That's correct.\" \"But you don't know the individual who should've been responsible?\" \"I don't know.\" McCain turns to Drew. He quotes Dimon saying the bank had been \"sloppy\" and \"stupid.\" McCain asks Drew if she agrees. Do you agree with your former boss who called you stupid? She says there was deception she had not been aware of. Her dander is a bit up it seems, there's a slight sharpness in her voice that feels like it could cut. But not yet. Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin is always reliable for a blunt question. He asks Bacon, the current risk officer, if the problem at the bank wasn't that everyone thought the bank was too big to fail? Bacon says that was not the governing psychology. Johnson gives a short speech. \"We have not ended too big to fail... I think the goal of Congress should be to get the American people off the hook.\" He has to go. Levin asks Drew why the bank failed to send reports to federal regulators in February and March of last year. \"I had no part of any reports sent to regulators,\" Drew says. Levin asks her who was in charge of that. He wants names. She doesn't know who was in charge of that. Levin asks Peter Weiland, former head of market risk at the bank. He doesn't know who was in charge of that either. Tight ship! From Bloomberg: What Did Jamie Dimon Know About `Whale' Trade Loss? Levin's asking Drew about the trading habits that produced the London whale. She admits the trades were quickie, short-term positions, and individual trades were not subject to oversight. But Drew argues the bank had generally stable habits. \"The core position in the book, which was a short, high-yield position, was a long-term position that had been held many years,\" Drew says. Drew reads slowly, pausing, her voice filled with emotion. Coming up on a year after her resignation, the pain of her career's destruction is still visible in her face. Drew seems to stop just short of saying, \"I got burned in this.\" Actually she pretty much says it: Since my departure I have learned of the deceptive conduct by members of the London team, and I was, and remain, deeply disappointed and saddened to learn of such conduct and the extent to which the London team let me, and the Company, down. Looking back over my long career at JPMorgan Chase, I know that I \u2013 like the vast majority of the people with whom I worked \u2013 always did my job with integrity and care and always tried to act in the best interests of the Company. In the end, I left a job and a company I loved dearly, after 30 years of dedicated service, because of significant losses that occurred on my watch. I thank you for the opportunity to submit this statement, and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Ina Drew has begun testifying. Her prepared statement (here) reads in part: I am greatly saddened by the entire episode, which has caused financial and reputational harm to JPMorgan Chase and a large number of people with whom I was honored to work, and I deeply regret that the losses occurred on my watch. I am also saddened that the losses led to my departure from the Company, to which I had devoted 30 years of my life. Susan Dominus' profile of the spectacular rise and stunning fall of Ina Drew, \"The Woman Who Took the Fall for JPMorgan Chase,\" is here. Drew never craved public recognition, which is one reason, up until the trading error, almost no one outside of Wall Street had heard of her. Her longstanding anonymity is astonishing only in retrospect: All told, she invested nearly $350 billion for JPMorgan Chase. Drew had her hand on a major economic lever and was one of the key figures whose judgment Dimon relied on in keeping the bank steady through the financial crisis. Drew was part of the team that helped establish him as a model of restraint at a time when other bankers offered only tongue-tied defenses of their reckless behavior. Now she was responsible for the traders who had made Dimon look as fallible as everyone else, and at the very moment when he was trying, once again, to assure government regulators that banks could manage themselves, that bankers could risk-proof their balance sheets. Dominic Rushe is the Guardian Wall Street correspondent: His immaculateness Jamie Dimon isn\u2019t up for a grilling today, but senator Carl Levin isn\u2019t sparing him. As early as January 2012, Levin says, acceptable risk levels were being breached, and not just in the division containing the London Whale, but for the entire bank. \u201cThat four-day breach was reported to top bank officials, including CEO Jamie Dimon, who personally approved a temporary limit increase, and voila, the breach was ended,\u201d Levin says. Levin says, \"we're expecting a very long hearing.\" There are three panels.

Moore is the Guardian US finance and economics editor. Levin has finished his opening statement. It's scathing. Senate staff has spent the better part of the last year following the money. Here's a bit of Levin's statement: Well, we took that closer look, and it isn\u2019t pretty. A massive derivatives portfolio riddled with risk. A runaway train of derivatives trading blowing through risk limits. Hidden losses. Bank executives downplaying the bad bets. Regulators who failed to act. Together, the facts are a reminder of what occurred in the recent financial crisis: we can\u2019t rely on a major bank to resist risky bets, honestly report derivative losses, or disclose bad news, without a strong regulator looking over its shoulder, backed by laws that require transparency, risk limits, capital buffers against losses, and consequences for misconduct. Full statement here. Senator John McCain now speaking. He says the trades weren't conducted by rogue traders but \"their superiors were well aware of their strategies.\" Good morning and welcome to our live blog coverage of this morning's Senate hearing on JP Morgan and the world of rogue trades and traders. Last year the bank lost $6.2bn when a trader known as the London whale got way out over his skis trading derivatives with seemingly little or no internal oversight. He was playing with an instrument known as a synthetic credit portfolio to make outside bets on other financial instruments. The losses roiled the $27tn global credit market and raised questions about practices inside banks considered too big to fail \u2013 meaning banks the government would potentially use taxpayer dollars to save. Testifying today, among others, is former JP Morgan chief investment officer Ina Drew, who lost her job and saw her sterling reputation tarnished in the scandal. The hearing is being held by the subcommittee on investigation, chaired by retiring Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "SABMiller, the world's second largest brewer, is to give more than \u00a3400,000 in campaign donations to the African National Congress ahead of next year's general elections in South Africa, with lesser sums going to rival parties. Donations totalling 9m rand (\u00a3650,000), split among the top six parties in proportion to the share of votes won in the 2009 election, are being made despite most UK institutional investors being against such political dealings. Governance campaigners believe such contributions are not an appropriate use of shareholder cash \u2013 and, in some cases, give rise to perceptions of corruption. SABMiller has made cross-party contributions of 5m rand in South Africa in each of the last three general elections, but has chosen to raise the amount given ahead of next year's vote. The FTSE 100 brewer gave no explanation for the increase other than to note South Africa had experienced some inflation in recent years. Because it won close to two-thirds of the vote in 2009, the governing ANC party will receive the lion's share of funding on offer. This will delight Cyril Ramaphosa, a non-executive on the brewer's board and senior figure within the ANC and trade union movement. In December, Ramaphosa returned to the front line of South African politics after he was elected deputy president of the Jacob Zuma-led ANC. Graham Mackay, who was promoted from chief executive to executive chairman in breach of governance guidelines last year, said: \"This is an extremely important cause and it deserves our support ... South Africa has a vibrant, open democracy and SABMiller is proud to have made a contribution to that achievement.\" Asked when SABMiller expected South Africa's democracy to have reached sufficient maturity not to require party donations from the brewer, a spokesman said: \"At the next election we will assess what level of further support we will provide, if any.\" Last year, the International Corporate Governance Network, whose 500-plus members have $18tr under management, produced a paper ahead of the US election \u2013 during which corporate contributions reached record levels \u2013 warning of \"the potential for abuse, corrupt practice and reputational risk when companies seek political influence ... in ways that are not of clear benefit to its shareholders.\" SABMiller, which also makes donations to parties in El Salvador and channels funds from US staff to federal candidates in the US, was founded in South Africa in 1895. The business, which had grown extensive operations across Africa, was effectively forced to retreat into its South African heartland during the apartheid era. At that time SAB became a sprawling conglomerate and the country's largest employer. Divisions under the SAB umbrella included a supermarket chain, a clothing store, hotel and gambling companies as well as manufacturing interests in shoes, razors, matches, furniture, textiles and plate glass. During that period SAB attracted particular controversy when it became involved in the first of a series of controversial \"rebel tours\" by English cricketers, flouting a sporting boycott of apartheid South Africa. In 1982 the English rebels, including Graham Gooch and Geoffrey Boycott, officially played as the South African Breweries English XI. Today SABMiller has transformed into a global brewer after listing on the London stock market in 1999 and pursuing a series of major acquisitions around the world. However, its South African business still accounts for about 20% of SABMiller's top line operating profits. In 2009, 8.5% of this South African business was transferred to a broad base of black stakeholders, including staff and liquor store operators, under a government sponsored black empowerment initiative.",

      "bodyText": "Italy's outgoing prime minister has warned European leaders that the rigid austerity policies of the past three years have generated mass disaffection with the EU and a populist political backlash. In a bitter valedictory statement to a two-day EU summit that ended in Brussels on Friday, Mario Monti, who was crushed in the recent Italian election \u2013 a result that stunned the EU elite \u2013 pleaded for greater scope on economic and fiscal policy in the crisis. He complained that other countries such as France and the Netherlands were being granted more breathing space on their spending targets than he had been given over the past 16 months, and said that he had followed EU orders in his policymaking, an admission he did not emphasise during the election campaign. In the letter, Monti, a liberal reformer who was the darling of Brussels but roundly rejected by Italian voters, voiced disappointment bordering on a sense of betrayal at the way he was treated by fellow EU leaders, most notably in Berlin and Brussels. \"Since November 2011,\" when he replaced Silvio Berlusconi as caretaker prime minister, \"Italy has been delivering on all the policy objectives set out by the EU. In the meantime, some member states have been given extra time to reach their budgetary objectives,\" he complained. \"Not only has Italy not requested any extra time to perform its adjustment, but it did not request any financial assistance from the EU or any other international organisation. On the contrary, Italy has contributed to the financial assistance of other EU countries in need.\" Attending his final EU summit, Monti warned that the leaders were not acting strongly and fast enough to combat record mass youth unemployment, storing up trouble for themselves at the ballot box. \"Public support for the reforms, and worse, for the European Union, is dramatically declining, following a trend which is also visible in many other countries across the union,\" he said. \"To revive growth and fight long-term and youth unemployment would be the best message to counter the mounting wave of populism and disaffection with the European Union, showing that Europe is listening to people's concerns.\" While pursuing an agenda of fiscal and structural reform in office, Monti regularly pleaded with Berlin for more flexibility over the eurozone crisis. Ironically, the summit finally agreed to adopt more room for manoeuvre in the application of the eurozone rule book, although this will do little more than soften the harsh edges of the austerity medicine. Monti also called for the swift application of a German-inspired stick-and-carrot regime, which would see countries commit to \"contracts\" with the European commission on structural reform in return for funding rewards pegged to progress. The details of the scheme are to be devised by EU authorities by June. But already the scheme has run into trouble \u2013 no decisions are expected in June and several countries are balking at the surrender of sovereignty entailed.",

      "bodyText": "The UK arm of Spanish bank Santander handed 19 of its bankers more than \u00a31m last year, including its chief executive Ana Bot\u00edn who received \u00a34m. Lord Burns, the former Treasury mandarin who for a decade has chaired the former Abbey National business, which Santander bought in 2004, received a pay rise from \u00a3520,000 to \u00a3600,000 after the bank concluded he had fallen behind his peers. To comply with a request by the UK government to disclose the pay of the eight highest-paid bankers who are not executive directors, Santander revealed they all received more than \u00a31m and shared more than \u00a311m in total. European rules require the banks to disclose the number of \"code staff\" \u2013 those who take and manage risks. Santander employs 55 such staff who received an average of just over \u00a3830,000. The bank said four received a total of \u00a32.8m to buy them out of deals at previous employers, while one received a payoff of \u00a3322,000. The bank has voluntarily revealed the number of bankers paid more than \u00a31m \u2013 following the trend set by Barclays a week ago when it published for the first time the scale of the pay of its 140,000 staff. Barclays admitted 428 of its bankers received \u00a31m or more while bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland revealed that 95 of its staff topped the \u00a31m pay scale. The revelations about these pay policies led Simon Walker, the director general of the Institute of Directors, to attack the banks for making \"unacceptable\" payments. \"Thousands of people in those two companies alone earn more even than the prime minister. This is in scandal-hit companies who have had a far from successful year,\" Walker added. Santander pulled out of a deal with RBS to buy 632 branches during the year and was hit provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance. It reported a profit of \u00a31.1bn, down 2%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Five years ago this week the banking crisis became serious. March 2008 saw the collapse in the US of Bear Stearns; Lehman Brothers would fail six months later. A good moment, then, to ask what has changed in the world of mega-banking. Two stories this week suggest, in cultural terms at least, the answer is: very little. The cult of the superstar banker is alive and well. The first story was the revelation that UBS agreed to pay a golden hello of \u00a317.5m to Andrea Orcel, its head of investment banking. The Swiss bank, despite reporting a year of losses, thought the sum was nothing exceptional. \"In line with market practice,\" it explained, it had to buy Orcel out of his accumulated but deferred rewards at his previous employer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. In other words, don't blame us, blame Merrills. What nonsense. UBS chose to hire Orcel and thus chose to pay the colossal sum. It did so after being hit by the \u00a31.2bn Kweku Adeboli fraudulent trading loss and in the knowledge that it would be making thousands of staff redundant. Never mind all that, UBS seems to have concluded, we need a star. In a rational world, however, Orcel would have lost that status years ago for his central role as an adviser on the disastrous ABN Amro/Royal Bank of Scotland deal. We need him anyway and we'll take the \u00a317.5m on the chin, UBS decided. Astonishing. The second item was the damning report by a US Senate sub-committee on JP Morgan's \"London whale\" incident in which $6bn of trading losses were suffered in the bank's investment office in London. \"Representations made by the bank were incomplete, contained numerous inaccuracies and misinformed investors, regulators and the public,\" the investigation concluded. So is Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan's chief executive who initially described the affair as \"a tempest in a teapot,\" for the chop? Almost certainly not. Deputy heads have rolled already. JP Morgan says it has \"identified many of the issues cited in the report.\" And regulators, in the form the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, may be too embarrassed to press the matter because of their own failure to pursue the whale tale. So it's odds-on that Dimon will survive. He remains firmly within the banking superstar club and his talents are lauded regularly by Warren Buffett. Bob Diamond could be forgiven for feeling bitter. He was in the club, too, and Barclays' shortcomings on the regulatory front could even be considered modest when set against JP Morgan's during the whale incident. Bad luck, Bob, you were an exception. The business lobby and the banks Still, at least someone can still summon some indignation on banks and pay. He is Simon Walker, head of the Institute of Directors, who this week let rip, citing the awards of \u00a31m-plus to 523 employees of Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland. \"I'm not a rabid anticapitalist. But even I believe this state of affairs is unacceptable. Shareholder value has been destroyed, capitalism has been given a bad name, key measures of the market have been manipulated for cynical gains, taxpayers have shelled out billions to bail banks out, and yet vast rewards packages are still being handed out,\" he said. Strong stuff, all the more powerful for coming from a business lobbying group. Indeed, that was a point Walker made himself. \"The IoD's role is to promote good business, not simply defend everything that any business does. To defend the reputations of the millions of businesses who do the right thing, we must call out those who do wrong.\" So would the CBI \u2013 Britain's other big business lobbying group \u2013 like to join in? Up to a point. \"It was a brave speech that made a lot of important points,\" says director general John Cridland. \"I have a lot of commonality with Simon but it's for each of us in our own organisation to choose our own language. Banks should follow the road they have started down. That is, bonus pools should be smaller and more able to be clawed back.\" Cridland argues that the CBI is far from being an apologist for banks, despite counting a few within its membership. And, he's quite correct to say that various CBI submissions have been strong in calling for more competition between banks and in arguing for a need for a return to relationship banking to serve businesses better. All the same, the IoD's stronger language sounds more like the authentic voice of frustrated non-bankers in the business world. In private, you'll find plenty of senior business people who would regard even Walker's words as polite. How to unwind QE Terrific news, the Treasury could be in line for a \u00a351bn windfall, which will come in handy. Who says? The Bank of England, which has been calculating what will happen when the great quantitative easing programme is unwound and \u00a3375bn-worth of gilts are sold back to the market. Ok, that \u00a351bn figure is not set in stone. If one tweaks a few variables on gilt yields, the Bank's computer spits out a loss of \u00a38bn sometime around 2020. That's not so good. Actually, it's hard to shake the feeling that these theoretical calculations may be pointless. Here's Nick Parsons, strategist at National Australia Bank: \"The Bank of England will never sell any of the gilts in its asset portfolio. Not one. Ever. They will all be held to maturity. The very notion of QE unwind is a scam. A confidence trick designed to slow the pace of currency debasement.\" You can see what he means. Would investors applaud the appearance of a profit for the Treasury, which underwrites the scheme, and praise the wisdom of our central bank? Well, a few might if the economy was back on the rails and growing strongly. Alternatively, investors might fear that future governments would believe they had found a magic formula for creating money painlessly. \"The very moment that investors wise up to the fact that QE will never be reversed is a problem,\" predicts Parson. For now, it's a problem for the future. But the unwind question will have to be confronted at some point since it's now four years since the launch of the initial \u00a3200bn programme, which is a very long time to deploy emergency measures. It may turn out that getting into QE was the easy bit. Betting against the Pru Congratulations to Lansdowne Partners, which went against the hedge fund crowd by taking a 6% stake in Ocado last year. Smart move: the online grocer's share price has doubled this year and on Friday regained its 2010 flotation value. Hold the celebrations, though, Lansdowne was firmly on the wrong side of another big share price move this week. At Prudential, up 13% this week, it has a long-standing short position of 0.9%, which is a chunky bet given that the Pru is now a \u00a330bn company. Of course Lansdowne has plenty of winners in the financial sector, like Lloyds, to counter the losses on the Pru short. But it will be interesting to see how long it is willing to hold out. The Pru, on the back of success in Asia, is suddenly deeply popular.",

To defend the reputations of the millions of businesses who do the right thing, we must call out those who do wrong.\"</p> <p>So would the CBI \u2013 Britain's other big business lobbying group \u2013 like to join in?</p> <p>Up to a point. \"It was a brave speech that made a lot of important points,\" says director general John Cridland. \"I have a lot of commonality with Simon but it's for each of us in our own organisation to choose our own language. Banks should follow the road they have started down. That is, bonus pools should be smaller and more able to be clawed back.\"</p> <p>Cridland argues that the CBI is far from being an apologist for banks, despite counting a few within its membership. And, he's quite correct to say that various CBI submissions have been strong in calling for more competition between banks and in arguing for a need for a return to relationship banking to serve businesses better.</p> <p>All the same, the IoD's stronger language sounds more like the authentic voice of frustrated non-bankers in the business world. In private, you'll find plenty of senior business people who would regard even Walker's words as polite.</p> <h2>How to unwind QE</h2> <p>Terrific news, the Treasury could be in line for a \u00a351bn windfall, which will come in handy. Who says? The Bank of England, which has been calculating what will happen when the great quantitative easing programme is unwound and \u00a3375bn-worth of gilts are sold back to the market. Ok, that \u00a351bn figure is not set in stone. If one tweaks a few variables on gilt yields, the Bank's computer spits out a loss of \u00a38bn sometime around 2020. That's not so good.</p> <p>Actually, it's hard to shake the feeling that these theoretical calculations may be pointless. Here's Nick Parsons, strategist at National Australia Bank: \"The Bank of England will never sell any of the gilts in its asset portfolio. Not one. Ever. They will all be held to maturity. The very notion of QE unwind is a scam. A confidence trick designed to slow the pace of currency debasement.\"</p> <p>You can see what he means. Would investors applaud the appearance of a profit for the Treasury, which underwrites the scheme, and praise the wisdom of our central bank? Well, a few might if the economy was back on the rails and growing strongly. Alternatively, investors might fear that future governments would believe they had found a magic formula for creating money painlessly. \"The very moment that investors wise up to the fact that QE will never be reversed is a problem,\" predicts Parson.</p> <p>For now, it's a problem for the future. But the unwind question will have to be confronted at some point since it's now four years since the launch of the initial \u00a3200bn programme, which is a very long time to deploy emergency measures. It may turn out that getting into QE was the easy bit.</p> <h2>Betting against the Pru</h2> <p>Congratulations to Lansdowne Partners, which went against the hedge fund crowd by taking a 6% stake in Ocado last year. Smart move: the online grocer's share price has doubled this year and on Friday regained its 2010 flotation value.</p> <p>Hold the celebrations, though, Lansdowne was firmly on the wrong side of another big share price move this week. At Prudential, up 13% this week, it has a long-standing short position of 0.9%, which is a chunky bet given that the Pru is now a \u00a330bn company.</p> <p>Of course Lansdowne has plenty of winners in the financial sector, like Lloyds, to counter the losses on the Pru short. But it will be interesting to see how long it is willing to hold out. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/mar/13/asia-growth-prudential?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">The Pru, on the back of success in Asia, is suddenly deeply popular</a>.</p>",

Asset values have recovered and a higher savings rate has allowed US households to reduce their outstanding debt burden.</p> <p>Now the bad news: The rebound in US private wealth has been largely matched by a rise in US federal debt from a pre-Lehman level of 64% of GDP in 2007 to 104% of GDP at the end of 2012. One way or another, households are the major taxpayers. If we treated the rise in public debt as a contingent liability of households, the apparent gain in US household net worth would largely disappear.</p> </blockquote> <p>This, he explains, matters for the US economic outlook. US households have repaired their household budgets and can start shopping again, helping to boost domestic demand. </p> <p>But, he says, the US government has no choice but to tighten the reins. The tax hikes of roughly 1.3% of US GDP at the start of last year and the recent automatic spending cuts of 0.7% of this year\u2019s GDP \"can only be the beginning\". He concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect the US economy to expand nicely as consumers drive the recovery. But the US government needs a long period of fiscal restraint. As a result, overall US demand growth will likely oscillate around 2% and not around the desired 3% for the foreseeable future. Austerity is inevitable and painful, especially if it is mostly done through higher taxes.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b2f21d9f-c3e0-4b90-a709-d76bb67a22c8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/15/1363357089433/7aa8c958-3a2d-4b02-b412-4c15777fc9f1-460x323.jpeg\" alt=\"The US consumer is back, helping drive the recovery in the world's largest economy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"323\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US consumer is back, helping drive the recovery in the world's largest economy.

He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Disagreement over public-sector staffing levels remain the key issue preventing release of the latest bail-out tranche to Greece.

Most of the so-called grillini are passionately committed to progressive causes (they eschew the mineral water that is everywhere available in parliament in favour of tap water, for example).</p> <p>But denying the existence of left and right is a classic sign of populism.

With disappointing US consumer confidence figures unsettling investors, the Brussels meeting over a bailout for Cyprus and the uncertainty in the Italian parliament also brought eurozone concerns back to the fore. So: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 39.76 points lower at 6489.65, down 0.61% \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.19% \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.71% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB fell 0.43% \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended down 0.45% \u2022 In Athens the market was 0.81% lower Meanwhile in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 41 points or 0.28%. So, with no white smoke from the Cyprus discussions or indeed the Italian parliament, it's time to shut up for the evening. We'll be back next week, with the UK budget on the agenda and the US Federal Reserve meeting, not to mention the latest developments from Italy, Cyprus, Greece et al. Thanks for all the comments and see you on Monday. And it looks like there will be weekend working in Rome: Meanwhile in Italy, senators have failed to elect a speaker on the second vote. So, not going so well there. Waiting with bated breath for a deal on a bailout for Cyprus? May have to think again... The IMF has listed a string of reforms the European Union must carry out to stabilise its troubled banking sector. In its first formal study of the EU financial sector, it said significant progress had been made but more needed to be done. Reuters reports: Its 67-page report published on Friday listed a string of reforms that needed completing this year, with heavy emphasis on banks' coming clean on troubled property loans and other assets. \"In the near term more forceful action is warranted to cement recent gains in market confidence and end the crisis,\" the IMF said. The IMF carries weight, not least because it is a main architect of bail-outs of EU members Ireland, Portugal and Greece where troubled banks have featured prominently. Banks have been a concern in Spain and remain so in Cyprus. It urged the EU to move quickly in setting up a planned banking union with the European Central Bank supervising eurozone lenders from next year. There are still disputes over detail. Former Italian prime minister Romano Prodi has been airing his views about the current state of the eurozone. In an interview with Bloomberg, the former European Commission president said austerity measures in Europe had been excessive, and the euro was too high. The agency reports: \u201cThe euro has a very high rate of exchange,\u201d Prodi, a former European Commission president, said in an interview with Sara Eisen airing on Bloomberg Television today. \u201cI do think that it\u2019s stronger than needed. \u201cThe austerity was, in my opinion, necessary in the beginning, it worked for a while, now it\u2019s gone too far,\u201d Prodi said. Prodi had been mentioned as a possible successor to Italian pesident Giorgio Napolitano when his term expires in May. In a separate Bloomberg interview he dismissed this speculation, saying he had alienated fellow politicians over the years with his strong positions. \u201cI have always been -- let\u2019s say -- very strong-minded in my political opinion, I always take positions,\u201d Prodi said. \u201cI think that is not a concrete probability that the majority will vote for me.\u201d And with that I'll hand you over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Depositors in Cyprus banks are likely to be taxed in some way to help towards a bailout of the tiny island, Reuters is reporting, after policymakers discarded the idea of imposing outright losses on deposit holders. Eurozone finance chiefs are preparing for a 4pm meeting to discuss a Cyprus bailout, which is likely to result in, at least, a provisional agreement. Luke Baker writes: \"Bailing-in\" bank depositors would be legally difficult and carry the risk of weakening confidence in banks across the eruozone, the officials said. Germany, Finland and the IMF had supported the bail-in idea. A tax on the total sum of depositors of 5%, for example, or a tax of 20%-30% on interest generated by the deposits would be easier, officials said, and not threaten financial stability. Adding to the bad news for the US, consumer confidence tumbled to its lowest in over a year in March. The latest consumer sentiment survey by the University of Michigan showed Americans were dissatisfied with government economic policies and fewer expected to see improvements in growth or the jobs market. The index dropped to 71.8 from 77.6 in February, a huge miss from expectations for a reading of 78. It was the lowest level since December 2011. That will likely dent the rally in US shares. The Dow is currently down 39 points on the day, or 0.3%. Looking back at the US economic data out this week, Holger Schieding of Berenberg Bank notes that there is both good and bad news. First the good news: Americans are getting richer again. Asset values have recovered and a higher savings rate has allowed US households to reduce their outstanding debt burden. Now the bad news: The rebound in US private wealth has been largely matched by a rise in US federal debt from a pre-Lehman level of 64% of GDP in 2007 to 104% of GDP at the end of 2012. One way or another, households are the major taxpayers. If we treated the rise in public debt as a contingent liability of households, the apparent gain in US household net worth would largely disappear. This, he explains, matters for the US economic outlook. US households have repaired their household budgets and can start shopping again, helping to boost domestic demand. But, he says, the US government has no choice but to tighten the reins. The tax hikes of roughly 1.3% of US GDP at the start of last year and the recent automatic spending cuts of 0.7% of this year\u2019s GDP \"can only be the beginning\". He concludes: We expect the US economy to expand nicely as consumers drive the recovery. But the US government needs a long period of fiscal restraint. As a result, overall US demand growth will likely oscillate around 2% and not around the desired 3% for the foreseeable future. Austerity is inevitable and painful, especially if it is mostly done through higher taxes. For his part, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said: In Europe, too many young people are asking if they will ever find a job or have the same quality of life as their parents. And we need to give them a better prospect. He noted various schemes that have been targeted at reducing youth unemployment, including the Youth Guarantee, which would promise young Europeans either a job, further education, or work-focussed training, at the latest four months after becoming unemployed. Barroso said: I really saw a commitment of the heads of state and government to address this problem with the sense of urgency required. European Council president Herman Van Rompuy has issued a statement following the summit of EU leaders. He said the council looked at issues like companies' access to credit as a key driver for growth, at competitiveness, and how well the jobs market was functioning. He said: There is a need for a specific employment policy, making our growth more labour-intensive. He added that policymakers must keep up the pace to implement the single supervisory mechanism for banks in the region. The coalition in Greece will collapse by the middle of next year, the Economist Intelligence Unit has warned. Following Greece\u2019s failure to convince the troika to release the next slice of bailout funds, Martin Koehring, analyst at the Economist Intelligence says the government will not last until the second half of 2014, causing a fresh election and potentially complicating relations with the troika even more. He says: Disagreement over public-sector staffing levels remain the key issue preventing release of the latest bail-out tranche to Greece. With the unemployment rate already above 24%, the government finds it difficult to implement its commitment under the bail-out programme to reduce the public-sector workforce by 150,000 by 2015. The troika has said that talks would resume in early April. However, the delay will create cash-flow problems for the government since the March tranche of funding will not now be authorised at least until April. It also jeopardises timely disbursement of the second-quarter tranche. Ongoing disagreements between the troika and the government are set to exacerbate tensions within the fragile three-party coalition government. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the coalition to collapse by the second half of 2014, causing a fresh election and potentially complicating Greece-troika relations further. Over to the US, where industrial production figures were better than expected, the latest in a run of good economic news from the world's largest economy. Industrial output grew by 0.7% last monthon a rebound in manufacturing, compared with forecasts for a rise of 0.4%. The data echoes a strong reading from Markit's PMI output index for February. Crucially, Angela Merkel said she saw no sign of desire to ease the austerity course and the EU will stand by its course of budget reduction. The lady is clearly not for turning. It remains to be seen how that message will play out at the German elections later this year. For her part, German chancellor Angela Merkel sounded a note of caution over a bailout for Cyprus. If you consider that at a certain point in time, Cyprus could not finance itself, then... you don't want to reach such a point, from a political point of view. But one cannot say that just because you don't want to reach such a point, politically, that you must help under any conditions. To leave Cyprus up to its own devices and simply see what happens would not be responsible in my view. She added that it would not be responsible to simply leave Cyprus to struggle on its own. Reports on Twitter suggest she is also keen to see a government in Italy \"soon\". In Brussels, the EU leaders have emerged from today's summit. Much of the talk is of the arms embargo with Syria, but there was also talk of the economic situation. First up, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. He said the group had not discussed Cyprus, but that issue will be addressed by eurozone finance ministers. The summit did discuss improving competitivity, he added. Back to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith says mass lay-offs in the public sector are not the only point of contention with troika officials who suspended talks with the debt-stricken country on Thursday. She writes: With recession worsening, higher taxes are another key issue The highly controversial property tax, introduced in 2011 and slapped on households through electricity bills, has elicited particular opprobrium, so much so that the conservative-dominated coalition promised to slash the EU-IMF mandated measure after assuming power in June 2012. Hit by successive rounds of pay and pension cuts and a barrage of other duties, more and more Greeks, who have seen their disposable income drop by as much as 50% in the last two years, say even if they wanted to, they can no longer afford to pay the tax. Growing numbers, who have inherited properties, say they are caught between a rock and a hard place: unable to sell properties in a depressed market but also unable to pay the duties now slapped on them. The emergency measure raises approximately \u20ac3bn a year - vital to revenues. Under immense popular pressure, prime minister Antonis Samaras' fragile coalition has attempted to persuade troika technocrats that it can raise the money if the tax is merged with other property duties. Mission chiefs from the EC, ECB and IMF, however, have not been convinced, citing the innate weaknesses of Greece's infamously leaky tax collection system. Insiders worry that if the government is seen to lose yet another battle in the tug and pull of negotiations, it could suffer a potentially fatal PR communications defeat. The fiercely anti-bailout political opposition has stepped up criticism of the government saying it is already reneging on its promises. Over in the US, consumer prices showed their largest increase in nearly four years in February. The consumer price index rose 0.7% after being flat in both December and January. This compares with expectations of a 0.5% increase. But this was largely due to a surge in the price of gasoline (or petrol, if you prefer) which jumped 9.1%, the largest gain since June 2009. The year on year increase in the CPI was 2%. With little in the way of underlying inflationary pressures, the figures should not prevent the US Federal Reserve pumping more money into the sytem through its bond buying programme to help boost the world's largest economy. Signs that the economy is indeed heading in the right direction come from the latest New York state manufacturing survey. The index came in at 9.24 in March, expanding for the second month in a row. But the rise was less than the 10.04 seen in February and below expectations of a figure of 10. New orders fell but firms continued to be optimistic, with the index of business conditions six months ahead hitting 36.43 from 33.07, its highest since April 2012. It was always going to be an unusual but memorable day as Italy's parliament reconvened after the recent inconclusive elections, with members of the maverick party founded by comedian Beppo Grillo taking their places for the first time. And so it is proving. Southern Europe editor John Hooper writes: Not since the dawn of the Italian Republic after the Second World War, when ex-Communist partisans arrived in force, has there been an opening of parliament anything like today\u2019s. The representatives of the Five Star Movement (M5S) unexpectedly respected the rule that male Italian lawmakers must wear ties (though, in line with the M5S\u2019s enivronmentalist principles, many chose a black one bearing the words \u201cNo Coal\u201d). But from the moment that the movement\u2019s deputies entered the Chamber, it was clear they were going to be awkward to deal with. Instead of taking up a position on the left or right of the semi-circle in which the members of the lower house sit, the M5S\u2019s deputies (who prefer to be called \u201ccitizens\u201d) ranged themselves around the back. \u201cNeither right nor left, but above (and beyond),\u201d chirped one of their number, Tiziana Ciprini, on her Facebook page. The whole episode reflected the view that the movement\u2019s co-founder, the comedian, Beppe Grillo, put to me in an interview last month: that the M5S cannot be fitted into conventional political categories. It is one of things that worries many Italians about the M5S. Most of the so-called grillini are passionately committed to progressive causes (they eschew the mineral water that is everywhere available in parliament in favour of tap water, for example). But denying the existence of left and right is a classic sign of populism. And Mussolini did it all the time. Across the pond, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan has been speaking. Greenspan \u2013 who coined the term \"irrational exuberance\" to describe the dotcom bubble of the 1990s \u2013 says he sees no sign of irrational exuberance in the market right now, and that, by historical standards, stocks are significantly undervalued. Asked on CNBC, if his successor Ben Bernanke willl stay in office after 2014, Greenspan says: I would hope so, but I would fully understand if he's had enough. Back to the UK, where the Bank of England's chief economist is sounding cautious over any possible extension to the central bank's role. In a speech in London, Dale says suggestions that central banks should focus more on growth, and that a period of higher inflation may even aid the recovery, is \"dangerous talk\". In recent weeks, George Osborne's chief economic adviser has been touring the US to sound out opinion on adjusting the Bank of England's remit, in a bid to aid the UK's economic recovery. The FT reports: The Treasury sees monetary activism as crucial for underpinning the recovery. In the Budget, Mr Osborne will state the MPC\u2019s annual remit and is likely to launch a debate, supported by Mr Carney, on whether it should change. The most radical option on the table is a \u201cdual mandate\u201d, as given to the Federal Reserve in the US, where the BoE would target inflation and a \u201creal economy\u201d variable such as employment. Portuguese finance minister Vitor Gaspar has said that conditions appear good for a possible bond issue in the coming weeks. That would be the second bond issue since its 2011 bailout, after it sold five-year government debt in January. Gaspar said: The conditions appear to be appropriate for a possible bond issue in the coming weeks. But he added that the country was under no pressure to issue debt and any decision to do so would depend on finding market opportunities. Taking a closer look at the eurozone labour costs, out earlier today (see 10.43am), the data revealed a wide variation across diffferent countries. In Germany, the cost of labour rose by a solid 2.9%, but dropped by 3.4% in Spain. While this is undoubtedly bad news for Spanish workers, it will raise hopes that competitiveness in the eurozone is (gradually) evening out. Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics writes: This might provide some further hope that the competitiveness gap between the northern and southern economies is slowly being closed, although it will have obviously detrimental effects on Spain\u2019s household sector in the near term. Hourly labour costs across the eurozone rose by just 1.3% in the last three months of 2012, compared with the same period in 2011. That was less than half the rise in early 2009, when Europeans were giving themselves generous pay hikes, driving up the cost of labour by 12% between 2001 and 2011. Over to Greece, where reports suggest the government is planning to sack 5,000 civil servants by the end of next year to appease its international lenders. The troika \u2013 of the EC, the ECB and the IMF \u2013 left Athens yesterday after failing to reach an agreement over reforms, delaying the payment of the next \u20ac2.8bn slice of bailout funds that Greece was due to receive later this month. The troika officials will return to Greece at the beginning of April. Ekathimerini reports that the Greek government offered to fire 5,000 workers by 2015, in return for the release of the bailout funds. It said the proposal was put to the troika representatives before they left. Eurozone consumer price inflation dropped to 1.8% in Februrary, its lowest level since mid-2010. Modest wage growth in the currency bloc added to signs that the European central Bank has room for an interest rate cut. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: While lower inflation is providing some much-needed good news for struggling consumers in many eurozone countries, low and reduced wage growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 adds to the pressures they are under. Weakened earnings growth comes on top of very high and rising unemployment in many countries, as well as tight fiscal policy. The ECB currently seems reluctant to take interest rates lower than the current record low level of 0.75%, but the bank could be forced into reconsidering its position if the eurozone fails to show clear signs of economic improvement over the coming weeks. Downside risks to the eurozone outlook could mount if protracted political uncertainty in Italy eventually leads to a renewed intensification of sovereign debt tensions. To the pound, which has seen a dramatic reversal in fortunes after outgoing Bank of England governor Mervyn King said last night it was now \"properly valued\" King has repeatedly talked down the pound since autumn and the currency has dropped by almost 6% against Britain\u2019s main trading partners since the start of the year. But King signalled yesterday that he thinks things have gone far enough, telling ITV News: We are moving to a properly valued exchange rate. I think we\u2019re probably there. Basically we\u2019re at the same level [of sterling] we were after the impact of the financial crisis. We\u2019re certainly not looking to push sterling down. We\u2019re looking to ensure recovery in the UK economy and gradually bring inflation back to our 2% target. His comments stand in contrast with the fact that King is known to have voted for an expansion of the quantitative easing programme \u2013 which would drive down the value of the pound \u2013 at the February meeting of the monetary policy committee. His apparent change of heart prompted criticism from some quarters. Portugal has been given more time to implement its deeply unpopular spending cuts after the country's economic outlook worsened. Finance minister Vitor Gaspar said Portugal had passed the seventh review carried out by inspectors from the country's troika of lenders - the ECB, the EC and the IMF. The troika have granted Lisbon an extra year to make cuts worth 2.5% of GDP, or roughly \u20ac4bn. These now have to be carried out by 2015, rather than 2014 as previously stipulated. Portuguese GDP is expected to drop by 2.3% this year, much deeper than the 1% drop expected at the time of the last review in November. Italian government debt topped two trillion in January, a new historical record. That compares with \u20ac1,988bn the previous month and caused some astonishment on Twitter. But any deal on Cyprus agreed today will not be definitive, reports Reuters. Luke Baker writes that a framework for a deal will be presented to the Eurogroup working group before midday on Friday, which will assess whether the plan goes far enough in steadily reducing Cyprus' debt over the coming years and ensuring that the bailout can be paid back. Eurozone finance ministers then meet at 4pm to consider the package. Baker reports: Officials said the best that could be hoped for was a \"political agreement\" on the proposal, since input may still be required from Russia to finalize the terms. Cypriot Finance Minister Michael Sarris will travel to Moscow for meetings on Monday, a Cypriot diplomat said, raising the possibility that an agreement on participation can be struck with the Russians then. Plans are already being made for another meeting of euro zone finance ministers in the middle of next week, once the Cypriot finance minister has returned from Moscow and officials have a more precise idea of the shape of the rescue deal. The Wall Street Journal is running quotes from Luxembourg's prime minister (and former head of the Eurogroup) Jean-Claude Juncker, suggesting the solution to Cyprus's difficulties won't be the same as Greece's but it should have the same result. Leaving the summit in the early hours of this morning, Juncker said: In the Greek case we said we would never replicate the solution applied to it. That said, we should find a solution [for Cyprus] that won't be the same but that produces the same results. Asked if depositors at Cypriot banks could lose part of their deposits in a bailout agreement, he said he could not be clear on the solution the eurozone would come up with. He and other leaders have expressed hopes an agreement can be reached on Cyprus today. There are hopes that the finance chiefs of the 17 eurozone nations will come to more concrete conclusions, with an agreement over a Cyprus bailout later today. Christian Schulz of Berenberg bank summarises the key elements of a possible deal, as follows: A smaller package: According to Eurogroup chief Dijsselboem, the package could be \u20ac10bn rather than \u20ac17bn. A depositor contribution: The money needs to come from somewhere. Crucially, a deal must avoid bank runs and repercussions in other countries. Privatisations and a modest corporation tax increase would be harmless. A one-off depositor tax, as a controlled form of depositor bail-in, is riskier but seems likely. Fortunately, a contagion-prone sovereign debt restructuring seems off the agenda. IMF involvement: Northern Eurozone states demand a similar IMF involvement, as in the other bail-outs. Russia also seems ready to extend a \u20ac2.5bn loan and reduce interest rates. Over in Brussels, the summit continues but leaders are unlikely to take any far-reaching decisions. European politicians are said to be nervous about the outcome of Italy's elections which delivered a resounding rejection of austerity, but feel they have little room for manoeuvre, if they want to retain the confidence of the financial markets. Our European editor Ian Traynor writes in today's paper (second half of article): \"If you need to get people to lend you money, if you finance yourself in the markets, an economic policy shift is not viable,\" said the senior diplomat. \"It's about credibility.\" The Thursday evening summit focused on economic policy options and was to be followed by another meeting of the 17 eurozone leaders at which Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, was to brief the meeting and was expected to name and blame countries failing to implement adequate structural reform. While the draft summit communique repeatedly referred to the need to stimulate growth and deplored Europe's record levels of unemployment \u2013 more than 26 million \u2013 there was little sign of any departure from the \"fiscal consolidation\" that has been the preeminent response to the crisis over the past three years. Nor was there any sign that Berlin was shifting its hard line on fiscal and budget discipline. Rather, the Germans stressed that the absolute priority was for Europe to regain competitiveness by reducing unit labour costs and through structural reforms to labour markets, pension and welfare systems. The likeliest outcome was agreement on a set of policies that may take a little of the rough edges off the austerity packages, by delivering several billion euros to fight youth unemployment in the worst-hit areas or slightly relaxing budget deficit ceilings by allowing big public investment projects deemed eventually to be contributing to growth to be taken out of the calculation. Agreement was also expected on \"flexibility\" in interpreting the rules for national debt and deficit levels in the eurozone, signalling that countries like France, Spain, and the Netherlands could be given longer to observe the ceilings. The first task facing the lawmakers this morning is to elect speakers of both houses. These roles wield significant power as, along with internal budget commissioners, they oversee the more than \u20ac70m that gets handed out annually to individual party delegations to the cost of staff and expenses. Until now, details of these payments have been kept secret but an M5S speaker would be likely to lift the lid on how that money is spent. Bloomberg reports: Grillo, an ex-comic, drew cheers during the election campaign by saying at rallies that his lawmakers would \u201copen parliament like a can of tuna\u201d by revealing backroom discussions and detailing expenses that haven\u2019t been published. Voting for the two speakers begins at 9.30am in the lower house and 10am in the Senate. The majority required diminishes after each inconclusive ballot. But, Italian news agency ANSA reported yesterday that Bersani told his allies he would seek to scupper the votes because there has not yet been any progress towards forming a coalition. The Five Star deputies and senators range from lawyers and scientists to unemployed activists, none of which have any previous parliamentary experience. And they are preparing to shake-up parliament, saying they they will shun the Italian parliamentarian\u2019s title of \u201cHonorable\u201d and refuse privileges typically reserved for lawmakers and unavailable to citizens at large. Bloomberg reports: [Italian] lawmakers make about \u20ac20,000 a month in salary and benefits, including train and air travel. Yesterday, Grillo called on Pier Luigi Bersani, head of the largest parliamentary force, to persuade his members to give up more than half of their pay. Monthly salaries, at about \u20ac11,000 should be reduced to \u20ac5,000, Grillo said. First off, Italy, where members of Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement (M5S) will be preparing to take their place in parliament for the first time today. Just to recap, Italy has found itself in political gridlock after elections last month that split the country three ways. Together with their smaller allies, Pier Luigi Bersani's centre-left Democratic Party (PD) won control of the lower house, with 340 seats, after benefiting from the automatic premium, which guarantees the alliance that wins most votes 55% of the seats. But the party did did not get the necessary majority in the upper house, the senate, which holds the same legislative powers as the chamber of deputies. Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s centre-right alliance won 124 seats in the lower house. But the upstart, anti-establishment M5S was the real shock of the election, winning more than 25% of the votes, the largest share for any single party (beating the PD on its own, but not the PD plus smaller allies). That gives MS5 108 seats. The party is now seen as the key to any coalition government as neither Bersani nor Grillo are willing to consider an alliance with Berlusconi. There's also some economic data to keep us busy, while Portugal will announce the results of its troika review later in the day. Spain house prices (Q4): 8am Spain labour costs (Q4): 8am Switzerland producer and import prices (February): 8.15am Italian parliament reconvenes: 9.30am Portuguese finance minister announces results of troika review: 9.30am Italy government debt (January): 9.30am Eurozone inflation (February): 10am US inflation (February): 12.30pm EU's Rehn speaks in Brussels: 2.30pm Eurogroup meets to discuss Cyprus: 4pm EU's Van Rompuy speaks in Brussels: 4.15pm Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. This morning, Italian politicians reconvene for the first time since the inconclusive elections almost three weeks ago. The politicians will be braced for a fight over key roles, such as speaker of the upper and lower houses, which could pave the way to a stable government. The EU leaders are also meeting for day two of their summit in Brussels to wrangle over the fine balance between austerity and growth. And later, the finance ministers of the 17 members of the eurozone will try and hammer out a bailout deal for Cyprus. We'll have updates from those events and other developments in the global economy throughout the day.",

      "bodyText": "Amid all the razzamatazz surrounding the long awaited launch of Samsung's Galaxy S4, two UK companies were also celebrating. Cambridge-based Arm, which supplies chip designs for the S4 as well as rival Apple's iPhone, added 6p to 928.5p following the product's unveiling on Thursday, while Imagination Technologies, whose graphics are in the Samsung phone, closed 12p higher at 552p. Arm shares have been under a little pressure recently, as analysts questioned whether its move into the Intel-dominated server market would be enough to outweigh loss of market share in its key tablets and smartphone sectors. But analysts at Jefferies did not seem to shares these doubts, raising Arm to buy from hold and lifting their target price from 805p to \u00a313. Jefferies said: We see development in four market areas (mobile computing, datacentres, networking, Internet of Things) as key to the emergence of Arm as the architecture of choice for the mid-to-long term. Arm remains well-positioned given: (i) rising royalty rates (cortex-A driven; later ARMv8), (ii) record licensing (estimated backlog of more than $570m), (iii) upcoming tax benefits (dropping to around 17% effective tax rate long term), and (iv) operating expenditure control showing through. Overall, we expect earnings growth (three-year compound annual growth rate of 40%) to continue largely unperturbed through 2013 to 2016. Meanwhile James Goodman at Investec cautioned on Imagination: The much anticipated Samsung Galaxy S4 launch was held in New York last night. The phone will ship in some regions (not unexpectedly) with Samsung's Exynos Octa chip (which is based on Imagination graphics).

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Bank executives to testify Friday after report claims company misled public during $6.2bn London Whale trading debacle", 
      "body": "<p>JP Morgan's $6.2bn London Whale trading debacle was born out of secretive trades and creative bookkeeping as the bank attempted to limit losses using a practice that one regulator called \"make believe voodoo magic\", a Senate investigation has concluded.</p> <p>The report by the Senate subcommittee on investigations, published on Thursday, detailed a series of failures in which accounts were hidden and trades were valued incorrectly to minimize losses. It also alleged that regulators were kept in the dark, a head trader's concerns went unheeded and a $51bn trading portfolio ballooned to $157bn in three months. </p> <p>The inquiry follows JP Morgan's own internal investigation in January and provides the first look into the emails and internal discussions at the bank around the infamous Whale trade. It centers on the secretive JP Morgan chief investment office, which accounted for as much as one-sixth of the bank's assets last year. </p> <p>The 300-page report alleges that JP Morgan hid losses, did not share information with its regulators, and misled the public. The report also blames the bank's regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and recommends reforming the way regulators oversee derivatives, the complicated financial instruments that played a role in the Whale trades and the financial crisis. </p> <p>The report also concludes that JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, whose bonus was cut in half to $11.5m last year, knew about the sustained trading losses when he dismissed the incident as a \"tempest in a teapot\" in April 2012. </p> <p>The report precedes a Senate hearing on Friday in which key players will testify, including former JP Morgan chief investment officer Ina Drew. Dimon will not take the stand. </p> <p>Surprisingly, the report presents Bruno Iksil, the head trader of JP Morgan's chief investment office, in a sympathetic light. According to Iksil, a head trader who earned the title of the \"London Whale\" in media reports because he was thought to be in charge of large trades, he loudly objected to the directives of his bosses, including Achilles Macris and Javier Martin-Vartajo. </p> <p>He called their instructions \"idiotic\", predicted more losses as early as January 2012, and commiserated with a junior trader about how they were forced to put the wrong value on some of their trades. At one point, those wrong values caused JP Morgan's trading partners to loudly object and call for $690m in collateral from the bank. </p> <p>Iksil said he also encouraged the bank to unwind the trades, but he believed his bosses were still hoping the trades would be profitable and were unwilling to accept how much money that would cost. </p> <p>As early as January 30, 2012, Iksil noted the failing trades and told his supervisor: \"[W]e have to report a loss in the widening today,\" and said \"we have to let the book simply die,\" implying that the portfolio of trades would fail. It would be three more months \u2013 in April \u2013 before press reports would unearth the growing losses, and at least June before JP Morgan put a stop to them according to the Senate. </p> <p>\"Mr Iksil sent Mr Martin-Artajo an email advising that they should just 'take the pain fast' and 'let it go',\" the report said. \"But according to Mr Iksil, his supervisor Mr Martin-Artajo disagreed and explicitly instructed him to stop losing money.\"</p> <p>JP Morgan promised regulators it would reduce the size of its bets, according to the Senate committee, which maintained that the bank instead created a portfolio of trades that metastasized from $4bn to $51bn in only three years, followed by a three-month \"trading spree\" that took it to $157bn. </p> <p>The Senate's inquiry focuses on something called the Synthetic Credit Portfolio, a shadowy group of trades that metastasized to $157bn. While the SCP, as it is called, was designed to protect the bank from the vicissitudes of the market, the report alleges that it encouraged gambling with the bank's money, some of which consisted of federally insured deposits. </p> <p>Many of the findings in the Senate report cover the same ground as JP Morgan's own internal investigation released in January. That investigation <a href=\"http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/events-files.cfm\">summed up the bank's own findings</a> of its \"flawed trading strategies, lapses in oversight, deficiencies in risk management, and other shortcomings.\" </p> <p>The Senate report is more heavily footnoted and researched, however, as well as twice the length. </p> <p>\"While we have repeatedly acknowledged mistakes, our senior management acted in good faith and never had any intent to mislead anyone,\" a spokeswoman for JP Morgan said. \"We cooperated fully with the Subcommittee's staff and welcome the opportunity to respond to the Senate's questions. We know we have made many mistakes related to the CIO matter, and we have already identified many of the issues cited in the report. We have taken significant steps to remediate these issues and to learn from them.\"</p> <p>Last year, according to a Vanity Fair profile, Dimon told employees, \"The London Whale drama has been harpooned, beached, eviscerated, cremated, and killed. So help me God! It's fish food.\"</p> <p>The investigators did not speak to some of the key players, including head trader Bruno Iksil or his supervisors, Achilles Macris and Javier Martin-Vartajo. But they subpoenaed their emails and taped phone conversations to piece together the narrative. </p> <p>The investigation paints a picture of a growing debacle that started with the bank's attempt to reduce the risk of its trades so that it would have a stronger capital cushion and look powerful to regulators. It started with the overconfidence of traders after a lucky bet made about $400m on the bankruptcy of American Airlines. Drew applauded the traders. </p> <p>They suffered from that overconfidence when they bet incorrectly on the bankruptcy of Eastman Kodak in January 2012.

      "bodyText": "JP Morgan's $6.2bn London Whale trading debacle was born out of secretive trades and creative bookkeeping as the bank attempted to limit losses using a practice that one regulator called \"make believe voodoo magic\", a Senate investigation has concluded. The report by the Senate subcommittee on investigations, published on Thursday, detailed a series of failures in which accounts were hidden and trades were valued incorrectly to minimize losses. It also alleged that regulators were kept in the dark, a head trader's concerns went unheeded and a $51bn trading portfolio ballooned to $157bn in three months. The inquiry follows JP Morgan's own internal investigation in January and provides the first look into the emails and internal discussions at the bank around the infamous Whale trade. It centers on the secretive JP Morgan chief investment office, which accounted for as much as one-sixth of the bank's assets last year. The 300-page report alleges that JP Morgan hid losses, did not share information with its regulators, and misled the public. The report also blames the bank's regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and recommends reforming the way regulators oversee derivatives, the complicated financial instruments that played a role in the Whale trades and the financial crisis. The report also concludes that JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, whose bonus was cut in half to $11.5m last year, knew about the sustained trading losses when he dismissed the incident as a \"tempest in a teapot\" in April 2012. The report precedes a Senate hearing on Friday in which key players will testify, including former JP Morgan chief investment officer Ina Drew. Dimon will not take the stand. Surprisingly, the report presents Bruno Iksil, the head trader of JP Morgan's chief investment office, in a sympathetic light. According to Iksil, a head trader who earned the title of the \"London Whale\" in media reports because he was thought to be in charge of large trades, he loudly objected to the directives of his bosses, including Achilles Macris and Javier Martin-Vartajo. He called their instructions \"idiotic\", predicted more losses as early as January 2012, and commiserated with a junior trader about how they were forced to put the wrong value on some of their trades. At one point, those wrong values caused JP Morgan's trading partners to loudly object and call for $690m in collateral from the bank. Iksil said he also encouraged the bank to unwind the trades, but he believed his bosses were still hoping the trades would be profitable and were unwilling to accept how much money that would cost. As early as January 30, 2012, Iksil noted the failing trades and told his supervisor: \"[W]e have to report a loss in the widening today,\" and said \"we have to let the book simply die,\" implying that the portfolio of trades would fail. It would be three more months \u2013 in April \u2013 before press reports would unearth the growing losses, and at least June before JP Morgan put a stop to them according to the Senate. \"Mr Iksil sent Mr Martin-Artajo an email advising that they should just 'take the pain fast' and 'let it go',\" the report said. \"But according to Mr Iksil, his supervisor Mr Martin-Artajo disagreed and explicitly instructed him to stop losing money.\" JP Morgan promised regulators it would reduce the size of its bets, according to the Senate committee, which maintained that the bank instead created a portfolio of trades that metastasized from $4bn to $51bn in only three years, followed by a three-month \"trading spree\" that took it to $157bn. The Senate's inquiry focuses on something called the Synthetic Credit Portfolio, a shadowy group of trades that metastasized to $157bn. While the SCP, as it is called, was designed to protect the bank from the vicissitudes of the market, the report alleges that it encouraged gambling with the bank's money, some of which consisted of federally insured deposits. Many of the findings in the Senate report cover the same ground as JP Morgan's own internal investigation released in January. That investigation summed up the bank's own findings of its \"flawed trading strategies, lapses in oversight, deficiencies in risk management, and other shortcomings.\" The Senate report is more heavily footnoted and researched, however, as well as twice the length. \"While we have repeatedly acknowledged mistakes, our senior management acted in good faith and never had any intent to mislead anyone,\" a spokeswoman for JP Morgan said. \"We cooperated fully with the Subcommittee's staff and welcome the opportunity to respond to the Senate's questions. We know we have made many mistakes related to the CIO matter, and we have already identified many of the issues cited in the report. We have taken significant steps to remediate these issues and to learn from them.\" Last year, according to a Vanity Fair profile, Dimon told employees, \"The London Whale drama has been harpooned, beached, eviscerated, cremated, and killed. So help me God! It's fish food.\" The investigators did not speak to some of the key players, including head trader Bruno Iksil or his supervisors, Achilles Macris and Javier Martin-Vartajo. But they subpoenaed their emails and taped phone conversations to piece together the narrative. The investigation paints a picture of a growing debacle that started with the bank's attempt to reduce the risk of its trades so that it would have a stronger capital cushion and look powerful to regulators. It started with the overconfidence of traders after a lucky bet made about $400m on the bankruptcy of American Airlines. Drew applauded the traders. They suffered from that overconfidence when they bet incorrectly on the bankruptcy of Eastman Kodak in January 2012. That kicked off nine straight days of trading losses that cost the bank at least around $50 million. One trader in the CIO told the Senate committee that \"they were told not to let an Eastman Kodak-type loss happen again.\" As the traders scrambled to keep the trades \u2013 which were designed to benefit if there was a financial crisis \u2013 they found that the improving bond market worked against them. Between January and March 2012, it didn't have one profitable day in its CIO portfolio, according to the report. The Senate report uses JP Morgan to make an argument for financial reform, including requirements for more disclosure and Washington oversight of derivatives, the complex financial instruments that played a key role in increasing losses during the crisis. The report also argues for the speedy adoption of the Volcker Rule, a key feature of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill that is meant to prevent banks from taking gambles of their own. The Volcker Rule has been held up by lobbying efforts. Carl Levin, an author of the Senate report, was also the co-author of the Volcker Rule. He has signalled he will not run for re-election.",
