    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Quite often the political debate in this country is about the \u201csensible centre\u201d \u2013 this mythical place that apparently captures the majority of voters. With his speech on Friday to the Melbourne Institute\u2019s Economic and Social Outlook Conference, Bill Shorten has correctly gauged that progressive parties don\u2019t win by conforming to a pre-established centre, but by instead convincing people that the centre needs to be more progressive. This week the Essential Report poll found that 71% of respondents agreed with the statement \u201cI wish both sides of politics would try to meet each other in the middle more often\u201d, and that 45% would consider voting for \u201ca new party that took ideas from both sides of politics\u201d. Such a finding is to a great extent both not surprising and not significant. Nearly half of voters might say they would vote for a new centre party, but all historical evidence suggests they would not. Emmanuel Macron and his new party might be a model to follow, but the reality is Australian politics differs greatly to France and as Macron has shown, a new \u201ccentrist party\u201d is more about branding that any actual new policy direction. Such polling might have you argue the ALP should tack for the centre and that Bill Shorten\u2019s speech on Friday in which he argued it was time to look at policies such as taxes, subsidies and expenditures \u201cincluding reforms that in the past we might have dismissed as too politically difficult\u201d, was a misstep. If 71% of voters want parties to meet each other in the middle, going for something that is \u201cpolitically difficult\u201d is surely code for pursuing something outside the centre. But such thinking would be a mistake, and the mistake is revealed in other questions within the poll. That 71% want parties to meet in the middle also means there are 29% of voters who have no real desire for compromise. That\u2019s not surprising \u2013 it\u2019s akin to Robert Kennedy\u2019s line that \u201cabout one fifth of people are against everything all of the time\u201d. But crucially what those 71% consider as the middle is greatly different \u2013 and what they want movement on is crucial. One voter might be in favour of parties meeting in the middle on the issue of negative gearing; but that is wildly different to a voter wishing they did it on individual workplace contracts or penalty rates. What constitutes the centre is where the real fight is. Consider the same poll also revealed that 61% support for the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Intriguingly that is 10 points less than the number who want political parties to meet in the middle. But it also highlights the myth of the \u201csensible centre\u201d. Just 15 years ago proposing same sex marriage would have seen you out of the centre. In 2004 a Newspoll found only 38% of voters were in favour of same-sex marriage. Those pushing for parties to meet in the middle would have counselled against any leader pushing that agenda. And yet parties and advocates continued to push for it, and now Australia\u2019s current position on marriage equality sees it as a backwards and bigoted compared to rest of the world. That is the problem with arguing for the centre \u2013 it is in effect an argument for the status quo \u2013 something no progressive party should ever seek. It was the big problem with Hillary Clinton. She was very much the realist \u2013 one who had seen change occur due to \u201cincremental\u201d steps \u2013 steps that involved compromise and meeting in the middle, and who believed that was the way forward. In her speech accepting the Democratic party\u2019s nomination she even cited the founding fathers of the USA, who she said triumphed because they \u201cbegan listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose\u201d. But Clinton forgot that those who push for social and economic change don\u2019t aim to compromise, they aim for the change. To that end, they drag their opponents to the bargaining table; they don\u2019t sit there waiting for them to arrive, ready to give up something, they bargain only if they have to, and if they have to they make sure they are the ones who control the framing of the debate. Thus Shorten\u2019s is the smart play. The latest labour force figures contained the excellent news that full-time employment has been growing strongly throughout 2017. Such a return of jobs is good news given 2016 was one of the few times in the past 25 years where full-time work went backwards. There is nothing to be gained by arguing that the debate needs to be about growth. Shorten needs to keep pushing for people to realise the debate is about more than that \u2013 that it needs to be as much about equality. In the speech he argued that \u201cinequality kills hope. Inequality feeds the sense that the deck is stacked against ordinary people, that the fix is in and the deal is done.\u201d The message has been quickly analysed as Shorten following a Corbyn/Sanders line. That might be overstating it, but even so, it is where the debate should be. The economic debate for too long was based in the old canard that there is a trade off between growth and equality. Thus the \u201cmiddle economic ground\u201d was that we needed to push for as much growth as we could and assume that the \u201crising tide will lift all boats\u201d \u2013 so even if inequality increased at least you could say everyone was better off. In effect, the debate on the economy was situated within the middle of the conservative force\u2019s liking \u2013 where removing industrial relations protections was fine because we needed to pursue growth; where cutting high income taxes and cutting government services and spending was fine because we needed growth. We bought the argument that a budget surplus and low government debt fuelled economic growth. But research has shown that equality is crucial for long-term economic growth, and people are more open to that view because they have seen what has happened in the past decade. Even in the past year, employment has improved but wage growth has not. If you want evidence that the rising tide does not lift all boats, then four years of flat real wages and declining purchasing power is more than enough to get people thinking the idea has merit. That shifts the centre. The ALP should not worry about polarising the conservative side of politics \u2013 that\u2019s not going to make people accept that inequality is a vital issue; all it will do is maintain the focus on boats and tides and all things rising. With the Greens in disarray, the ALP and the union movement needs to keep pushing the progressive side of politics and resist the easy, seemingly safe, but ultimately futile race for the centre.",

      "bodyText": "Don\u2019t worry, the Brexiters say \u2013 when the negotiations reach their nail-biting conclusion, Brussels will cave in. In parliament, there are more than enough Tory backbench MPs who hold this view to stymie any backsliding by chief negotiator David Davis and his cabinet colleagues. Or so they think. In the media, the Spectator is joined by the Daily Telegraph in giving Brexiters the backbone to carry on, when most of the establishment is obviously against the project. The view from the Brexit trenches can be summed up in the recent Spectator article headed \u201cIgnore the doom-mongers, and the EU\u2019s attempts to embarrass Britain \u2013 a good deal is looking likelier than ever\u201d. This is the cake-and-eat-it deal that secures full access to the single market, without making any concessions on the free movement of labour or the power of the European court of justice over disputes involving UK citizens and businesses. This message can also be heard inside the Treasury, where senior officials believe that when the final deal is announced, British business will smile at the result and UK plc will sail on happily as an independent nation. There will be enough access to the markets and institutions of the EU, they say, for the banks, the car companies and the pharmaceutical giants to scrap any relocation plans. Money talks is the message and even Michel Barnier cannot escape that basic maxim. But as a plan it is more akin to buying a lottery ticket than executing a well thought-out strategy. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the government is so cavalier. If ever there were two people who thought planning was boring and that most things could be achieved if carried through with elan and fortitude, it was George Osborne and David Cameron. Osborne, it must be remembered, botched two out of six budgets and was on course to miss his austerity target by five years when he was booted out of office, while Cameron\u2019s studious lack of planning landed the country with a Leave vote and a civil service about as prepared for the battle with Brussels as Baldrick was before going over the top in Blackadder Goes Forth. The same goes for Liam Fox\u2019s attempts to portray himself as a superb dealmaker who can help British business break into one virgin market after another. Fox flies to the US this week to begin laying the groundwork for a deal with the Trump administration. We don\u2019t know anything about the agenda he intends to pursue, because he has refused to answer questions about the specifics. Nonetheless, he talks big about his prospects for a deal, citing the recent EU-Japan and EU-Canada trade deals as examples of what can be achieved. What he ignores is that the EU-Japan deal only covers manufacturing and even then, there are flaws in the scheme that relate back to our relationship with the rest of Europe. As Jill Rutter, the Brexit specialist at the Institute for Government, said in a recent blogpost, Fox\u2019s view that a trade deal with the EU is easier than most ignores how trade works. She picks up on comments by Barnier, who says the convergence of current regulations is a good starting point, but what about the future, as the UK capitalises on its new-found freedom and makes its own independent rules? Barnier has said: \u201cThe questions that we have are: is that divergence reasonable? Is it under control? Is it mastered, and if so by whom? Or will it become a tool for regulatory competition with us?... It is one of the keys to the success of the negotiation \u2026 of the future relationship.\u201d The Japanese have agreed to converge with the EU, but once you look in detail at the deal, there are many areas where the two sides remain far apart \u2013 on vehicle emissions, for example. Japan can only gain from convergence, however small. The UK, already converged, can only lose. Rutter recognises that Fox and the other gamblers in government may prove to be right and, for the sake of a few car sales, the EU will roll over, but she warns \u201cit would be foolish for the UK to base its economic future on that hope\u201d. And yet that hope persists and continues to have a voice. Not among the major business groups, and most pointedly the British Chambers of Commerce, which this weekend has come out of hiding to declare the government\u2019s Brexit stance a disaster. Its stance shows that business leaders have little faith in Fox establishing bridgeheads into the US, Japan and EU economies to facilitate trade. They are wary of what he is prepared to concede, as are anti-poverty campaigners, who fear that in talks with the US he will usher back all the bad bits of the failed TTIP trade talks between Washington and Brussels, from secret arbitration courts to chemically washed chicken and greater access to public sector contracts. Michael Gove says his cabinet colleagues have informally agreed to allow free movement of labour for several years after quitting the European Union. It\u2019s a concession that affects the transition and not the ultimate deal. That deal is still expected to secure the main benefits of membership, while satisfying the demand for sovereignty in all matters. It is a hope and no more.",

      "bodyText": "When Rushden Lakes opens its doors on Friday it will be the first shopping centre to offer both a Marks &amp; Spencer and birdwatching in wetlands that are in the same league as the Camargue or Zambezi Delta. But welcome to 21st-century UK retail, where developers are working harder than ever to attract Britons who increasingly view a visit to a shopping centre as a family day out. The \u00a3140m Rushden Lakes scheme, set in a 200-acre reserve in Northamptonshire that keen twitchers will know is a designated Ramsar site, is the biggest of its kind to open this year and offers a rare bright spot amid the gloom in retail sectors as experts warn shopkeepers are experiencing their worst trading conditions in five years. \u201cHousehold debt is very much on the rise, as any positive performance in the retail sector over the last 12 months has nearly entirely been funded by credit,\u201d said James Knightley, ING chief international economist who is a member of the KPMG/Ipsos retail thinktank. \u201cWith wage growth continuing to struggle, the uncertainty of Brexit negotiations and current unstable political climate, the spending power of the consumer and their \u2018want\u2019 to shop is diminishing and could spell trouble ahead for retailers in the UK,\u201d he continues. Although UK store bosses are facing challenging trading conditions, the sector\u2019s problems are not in the same league as in America, where there is more than five times more retail square footage per person than here. In the UK, retailers have already had to adapt to the internet age because online firms have grown rapidly to account for around 17% of sales. US retailers are belatedly waking up to that threat as their shoppers are about five years behind that spending curve. But UK retail has its own problems, owing to the squeeze on profit margins created by the recent rise in business rates and the increase in the legal minimum wage for over-25s. According to accountancy firm Moore Stephens, 5,538 clothing retailers \u2013 some 18% of this sector \u2013 are now at risk of going bust as they struggle with rising overheads. The fashion industry has been hit hard by the fall in sterling, following the Brexit vote, which has pushed up the cost of importing goods, a cost that many smaller retailers have been forced to pass on to shoppers. \u201cClothing retailers are being buffeted hard on many fronts,\u201d said Jeremy Willmont, head of restructuring and insolvency at Moore Stephens. \u201cRising costs and intensifying competition are putting pressure on revenue and making profit margins harder to maintain.\u201d In the US, retail jobs are disappearing in their thousands as main street veterans like Macy\u2019s and Sears embark on major store closures. But the same is expected to be true here with the British Retail Consortium predicting up to 900,000 job losses and thousands of store closures over the next decade as retailers cut their cloth for leaner times. Moore Stephens says the recent high-profile insolvencies of high-street names, such as BHS, highlight the pressure the sector is under. \u201cMany bricks-and-mortar retailers are already being used as a showroom for customers\u2019 online purchases,\u201d said Gareth Jones, retail partner at Moore Stephens. \u201cFailure to adapt to multichannel retail will mean more household names disappearing from the high street. That isn\u2019t just a UK trend, the US and Europe have also seen long-established brands fail to make the most of their multichannel offerings and suffer as a result.\u201d",

US retailers are belatedly waking up to that threat as their shoppers are about five years behind that spending curve.</p> <p>But UK retail has its own problems, owing to the squeeze on profit margins created by the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/24/business-rates-relief-fund-sajid-javid-general-election\" title=\"\">rise in business rates</a> and the increase in the legal minimum wage for over-25s.</p> <p>According to accountancy firm Moore Stephens, 5,538 clothing retailers \u2013 some 18% of this sector \u2013 are now at risk of going bust as they struggle with rising overheads.</p> <p>The fashion industry has been hit hard by the fall in sterling, following the Brexit vote, which has pushed up the cost of importing goods, a cost that many smaller retailers have been forced to pass on to shoppers.</p> <p>\u201cClothing retailers are being buffeted hard on many fronts,\u201d said Jeremy Willmont, head of restructuring and insolvency at Moore Stephens. \u201cRising costs and intensifying competition are putting pressure on revenue and making profit margins harder to maintain.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, retail jobs are disappearing in their thousands as main street veterans like <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/macys-holiday-season-closings/\" title=\"\">Macy\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/05/investing/sears-kmart-closing-stores/\" title=\"\">Sears</a> embark on major store closures.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The bright, electric future of the railway has been dimmed: trains will now continue to run on diesel west of Cardiff to Swansea, as they will on the Midland mainline to Nottingham and Sheffield. An announcement sneaked out on the last day before parliament went into summer recess has sparked howls of betrayal, in Wales in particular. Rail electrification, the government had once boasted, would bring quicker, greener, more reliable services, jumpstarting the economy and creating jobs with its high-voltage wires. Now it is scrapped, and ministers say at least people will not have to put up with unsightly masts. If it is bad news for communities whose railways will never reach the improved level of service promised, it also marks a moment where the dial is turning down of investment in the UK\u2019s rail network. Escaping much scrutiny, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, also last week issued 2017\u2019s version of a document that in 2012 heralded what the Conservatives vaunted as the \u201cbiggest investment in rail since Victorian times\u201d: a draft of Network Rail\u2019s \u00a338bn five-year plan and the basis for a 2015 manifesto listing a string of transport goodies for the regions \u2013 not least the Northern Powerhouse. In that plan, electrification of 850 miles of railway was at the heart of \u00a313bn for new infrastructure. Now, Grayling\u2019s first \u201cHLOS\u201d, or high-level output statement, says tersely it \u201cdoes not commit to infrastructure enhancements\u201d. Observers are worried. Lilian Greenwood MP, Labour chair of the transport select committee, says failure to provide specific details is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. How did rail get here? At the heart of the slow-burning debacle is the ballooning cost of the electrification of the great western line, whose initial budget of \u00a3895m had reached \u00a32.8bn before the scheme was trimmed at the edges around Bath, and now truncated at Cardiff. The overspending was admitted in 2015, when Network Rail\u2019s chairman was ousted and its unworkable five-year plan reviewed. \u201cPauses\u201d to work became tacit admissions of vast budget holes, whose full extent is yet to become clear as projects are pushed into future, notional plans. Emergency funds have been needed after the reclassification of Network Rail meant its easy borrowing, \u00a341bn of debt which had long disguised real costs, was ended. Little wonder that Grayling is wary, saying: \u201cNetwork Rail\u2019s progress on improving its efficiency in recent years has fallen short of my expectations.\u201d But neither does Network Rail want a similar mandate again. Chief executive Mark Carne told the Observer bluntly: \u201cI don\u2019t want a budget for enhancements. I don\u2019t want to go out with promised costs and expectations that can\u2019t be met. That damages the reputation of the industry and we\u2019re not going to do it again.\u201d Instead, individual projects will be costed to a high level of detail before funds are requested. A menu of TransPennine route upgrades, another fallen victim of the five-year plan, will be considered again in 2018 \u2013 but full, costly electrification is unlikely to be delivered. Necessity is the mother of spin doctors\u2019 invention, and electrification is no longer painted as a panacea \u201cdisruptive and unsightly\u201d in government announcements. Despite the rumblings on the tracks, the industry\u2019s gravy train will roll for some time yet. The man who signed off the 2014-19 plan at Network Rail, David Higgins, chair of HS2, has faced down scepticism over the project\u2019s own \u00a355.7bn budget \u2013 underlined by revelations last week that it spent millions in unauthorised redundancy payments to highly paid staff. Yet with the full high-speed route now announced and \u00a36.6bn of contracts awarded, HS2 at least looks guaranteed \u2013 even if the current era of multiple grands projets, such as Crossrail and the Thameslink programme through London, is unlikely to be replicated soon. And passengers will see newer trains sooner \u2013 a straw clutched by the Department for Transport last week. Instead of parking the Hitachi electric trains, more will be converted to bi-mode, to run on diesel down unelectrified tracks in South Wales and the Midlands. More British-built trains are coming, in what has become a quietly successful turnaround. A swath of train orders for London Overground and the South Western and East Anglia franchises are underpinning thousands of highly skilled jobs at Bombardier. While trains have been built in Derby since 1840, the plant feared for its future in 2011 when big contracts such as Thameslink went to competitors abroad, soon after Hitachi had won the \u00a35.7bn contract for the bi-modes Wales now needs. While Hitachi\u2019s assembly plant, opened in 2015 in County Durham, was a boost to the north-east, Derby\u2019s renaissance means more skilled work is done in the UK rail industry. Matt Colclough, general manager of the Bombardier plant, highlights the 400 people employed just in creating the electrical train components. \u201cThis is unique to Derby. A good 50% is the electrics \u2013 it\u2019s the nerve centre of a train, the brain really.\u201d While he won\u2019t name competitors, Hitachi ships in the bodies from Japan, where much of the \u201chigh-value\u201d design and manufacture is done. The Derby plant houses hundreds of engineers, designing and testing Bombardier\u2019s new generation of Aventra trains. Colclough says it has upped its game to win contracts: \u201cWe\u2019re spending a lot more time in the design phase, making sure we\u2019re doing things in the most efficient and productive way.\u201d Building trains in an \u201cergonomically correct\u201d fashion, he says, means completing and testing the carriage\u2019s constituent parts, then assembling them, rather than wiring them up afterwards \u2013 and also takes the risk away from a production line which boasts a rate of 25 carriages per week. A \u00a320m investment in recent years includes a test hall complete with a 25,000-volt power supply running down to the train\u2019s pantograph, and a \u201cTrain Zero\u201d room. Here, an Aventra train exists as a control console and all of its electronics, but with no body, allowing its systems to be tested as if it were hurtling along at 125mph. Derby\u2019s investment was secured in the wake of winning the Crossrail trains contract; a victory enabled, in the wake of public pressure, by the government easing its financial path. That episode underlined the political importance of the rail industry, secured again by HS2 and train building. But questions over whether the billions invested in the industry represent value for money should make ministers hesitate before opening the Treasury vaults again.",

      "bodyText": "For anyone growing up in the 70s and 80s having a SodaStream was the kitchen sink equivalent of a magic show with the gadget up there with Swap Shop and E.T. as a pop culture reference for the era. At that time the coveted \u201cfizzy-drinks maker\u201d was proudly displayed on 40% of British kitchen counters, attracting the kind of awed attention that a spiraliser could only dream off today. It was a simpler time for consumers and today SodaStream faces stiffer competition for the nation\u2019s attention as NutriBullet fruit and veg blenders bump up against Magimixes on crowded worktops. But SodaStream, which is listed on New York\u2019s Nasdaq exchange, has seen its share price more than double in the past year after it started downplaying the \u201csoda\u201d that inspired its name, and repositioned itself as a green alternative to glugging cans of Coke and Pepsi. \u201cEurope is on fire [in sales terms] and the UK is part of that,\u201d says the SodaStream chief executive, Daniel Birnbaum. \u201cWe have a way to go but we got to 40% [of British homes] before by just being fun.\u201d It certainly does have a way to go. At the moment only 1% of British households have one and 15% of owners never replace the gas refill, rendering it useless. But Birnbaum thinks the spending squeeze prompted by the Brexit blow to sterling will give its promise to make water \u201cexciting\u201d renewed appeal to browbeaten consumers. \u201cIf the tap water is of high quality then why not transform tap water?\u201d says Birnbaum with a zeal bordering on parody. \u201cWe\u2019re the brand of the people ... we empower you to make your own beverage.\u201d In 2014, the Israeli company was targeted by pro-Palestinian activists for operating a factory in the West Bank. The row led Scarlett Johansson to quit her ambassador role with Oxfam after the charity criticised her for appearing in a SodaStream commercial. The company closed the plant in 2015 but Birnbaum says the decision was economic rather than political as it consolidated operations on one main site in Rahat, in Israel\u2019s south, where it continues to employ Palestinians. This year it started printing an Israeli flag on its boxes accompanied by the caption: \u201cThis product is made by Arabs and Jews working side by side in peace and harmony.\u201d With Britons suffering the longest decline in their spending power since the 1970s there is growing evidence of shoppers changing their behaviour, such as buying more own brands to save precious cash. Last week Paula Nickolds, the boss of department store chain John Lewis, signalled the return of \u201cthe lipstick effect\u201d \u2013 whereby a rise in sales of beauty products heralds a consumer squeeze as shoppers opt for small treats rather than big purchases. Last year SodaStream, which has a market value of $1.3bn (\u00a31bn), sold nearly 1m machines, up from 769,000 in 2015, with western Europe its biggest market. In the UK, most people use them to make sparkling water. Sales of refills are up 34% this year. SodaStream claims \u201cif you get busy with the fizzy\u201d you can save hundreds of pounds a year but its sums are based on shoppers with a heroic thirst level paying top whack for premium brands. To get started you can buy a machine and plastic bottles for \u00a350 after which gas refills \u2013 which make 60 litres \u2013 cost \u00a312.99. To make soft drinks you have to buy flavourings, increasing the cost from 21.6p a litre for sparkling water to 66p for a cola or lemonade. Based on industry figures Britons drink more than four litres of soft drinks a week so if a household buys four litres of Highland Spring at 50p a litre, and the same amount of Coca-Cola at 80p a litre, the hardware would pay for itself in around five months. You could save more money by switching from brands to supermarket own-label drinks but the sodanomics might be more persuasive next year when a tax on high-calorie soft drinks kicks in with a top rate of 24p a litre. There is also the promise of beer literally on tap this Christmas after SodaStream ran a successful overseas trial of \u201cBlondie\u201d, an alcoholic concentrate capable of turning tap water into a type of beer. What a SodaStream does offer though is a route to cutting down on your consumption of single use plastic bottles if you have a fizzy drink habit. Figures obtained by the Guardian this month revealed that across the globe 1m plastic bottles are bought by consumers every minute \u2013 roughly 20,000 a second \u2013 a rate of consumption that has triggered an environmental crisis. Dr Laura Foster, head of pollution at the Marine Conservation Society, says the amount of plastic ending up in landfill and oceans is \u201cstaggering\u201d: \u201cWe need to decrease the amount we use in our ever day life,\u201d she said. \u201cReusing a refillable bottle is a really simple and straight forward way to reduce both your plastic and carbon footprint.\u201d SodaStream\u2019s newest advertising campaign, which launched this week, stars The Big Bang Theory\u2019s Mayim Bialik and highlights the evils of single use plastic bottles. \u201cIt\u2019s easy and economical to enjoy water and delicious sparkling drinks made from tap water at home and without having to pollute the planet,\u201d says Birnbaum. But he would say that wouldn\u2019t he?",

      "bodyText": "City bond traders have put the champagne on ice. They had a good run. For some it lasted almost a year. But it\u2019s over now and the \u201cnew normal\u201d of low trading volumes and weak profits is reasserting itself. On Wall Street, Goldman Sachs took the biggest hit. This week the firm reported profits had plunged 40% in the second quarter on its bond, currency and commodities trading desks. All the other big names in the US investment banking world saw bond trading profits dive in the three months to the end of June, save for age-old Goldman rival Morgan Stanley, which restricted the loss to 4%. Lloyd Blankfein, the Goldman boss who rose through the ranks of bond traders to the top job, was unlikely to be sanguine about the turn of events amid concerns that his bank suffered more than most for relying on out-of-favour hedge funds as clients. Back in October 2016 the story was very different. Barclays was on a high after what it said was a summer bonanza for its bond traders, pushing quarterly profits to a two-year high. Likewise Goldman, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and JPMorgan were raking in the trades. Much of the reason for their optimism was a change of stance at the Federal Reserve. The US central bank signalled in late 2015 that the post-crash era of low inflation and low interest rates was coming to an end. To combat the threat of inflation, it would start to raise rates consistently through 2016 and 2017. This move put two trends in motion that spelled a big payday for the banks. First, the price of bonds started to fall, making them more attractive to buy. Second, not long afterwards, it became clear the other central banks were not going to follow suit in raising rates. That broke seven years of agreement among the major central banks to hold interest rates at near zero as a way to boost economic activity. The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were still on board, but Janet Yellen at the Fed had broken away. Without a consistent story, investors in fixed-income securities, the jargon name for bonds, found themselves needing to back several horses. And investors demanded the banks buy and sell their securities more frequently as uncertainty translated into an ever-changing mood in the market. The main measure of volatility \u2013 the Vix index \u2013 was still well below the 2009 peak, but it was elevated in 2016. And traders make money in periods when uncertainty and confusion raise levels of volatility. Until this moment bond trading floors had undergone a dramatic cultural shift. The brazen antics of Oliver Stone\u2019s flamboyant junk bond king character Gordon Gekko in his film Wall Street were consigned to history. In came the sober suits with an emphasis on cost control. Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at trading firm Ayondo, said the bond markets have become a more sober environment since the financial crisis. Lower profit margins and clients from the pension fund industry and sovereign wealth funds focusing on costs have forced the industry\u2019s colourful characters to tone down their antics. \u201cIt might be that Goldman suffered more than most because its reputation is for charging high prime broking fees. A reliance on clients like hedge funds, which are clearly out of favour for charging high fees themselves, might also have hurt Goldman,\u201d he said. Dhaval Joshi, chief European investment strategist at BCA Research, said the bond boom had come to an end as the fog around the course of interest rates, made worse by Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, intensified. \u201cWhen the Federal Reserve signalled that it would begin to raise interest rates, it changed the story. Since then there hasn\u2019t been a clear path,\u201d he said. Major bond investors got burned by this turn of events and while their initial reaction was to instruct the banks to switch their portfolios \u2013 prompting a rise in trading fees \u2013 they are now reluctant to take big bets. Joshi says the long-run trend for low inflation and low interest rates is about to reassert itself. This might mean a few more fees for the bank\u2019s bond departments as asset managers adjust their holdings again. But in the longer term, it means a loss of business as investors go back to just holding long-term positions. \u201cI don\u2019t think the long term trend is about to reverse, mainly because I don\u2019t believe inflation is about to return,\u201d he says. A realisation that Donald Trump\u2019s promises of higher growth, and with it higher inflation, are unlikely to happen for several years, if at all, and that Brexit will also take years to happen, add to the sense of renewed calm, and lower profits for bond traders.",
