The exit from QE is perhaps the biggest financial challenge to face the United States in decades.

QE made it too profitable to <a href=\"http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/ior_faq.html\">keep the money </a>sitting at the Fed. The Fed will continue to pay the banks high interest rates to keep the flood of money at bay. It will also offer the banks a higher interest rate to keep those deposits locked up for a certain period of time \u2013 like a certificate of deposit, but for major financial institutions. <br></p> <p>\u201cThey are willing to give banks whatever interest rates necessary.

In September the Fed increased the cap on such deals to $30bn per bank \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-19/fed-s-new-cap-on-reverse-repos-heightens-volatility-risks.html\">triple the previous $10bn</a> limit. </p> <p>This is why quantitative easing is ending with a whimper rather than a bang.

In a new report, Oxfam said that the number of billionaires doubled between 2009 and 2014 - a period in which many countries suffered deep recession, rising unemployment, welfare cuts and falling real incomes. Earlier this year, the charity said the world\u2019s 85 billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the world\u2019s population. In its latest study \u2013 Even It Up \u2013 Oxfam said that this elite group had seen their wealth collectively increase by $668m (\u00a3414m) a day in the 12 months to March 2014. It found that it would take the world\u2019s richest man - Mexico\u2019s Carlos Slim - 220 years to spend his $80bn fortune at a rate of $1m a day. With an endorsement from Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, the report said a 1.5% billionaire wealth tax would raise $74bn a year \u2013 enough to put every child in school and provide health care in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Since 2009, at least a million women have died in childbirth due to a lack of basic health services and around the world 57 million children are currently missing out on school, the charity said. Mark Goldring, Oxfam\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cInequality is one of the defining problems of our age. In a world where hundreds of millions of people are living without access to clean drinking water and without enough food to feed their families, a small elite have more money than they could spend in several lifetimes. \u201cThe consequences of extreme inequality are harmful to everyone - it robs millions of people of better life chances and fuels crime, corruption and even violent conflict. Put simply, it is holding back efforts to end poverty. Governments around the world have been guilty of a naive faith that wealth going to those at the top will automatically benefit everyone. That\u2019s not true \u2013 it is their responsibility to ensure the poorest are not left behind.\u201d The leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have both called for action to tackle inequality. Oxfam blamed growing inequality on \u201cmarket fundamentalism and the capture of politics by elites\u201d. It said the policy response should involve: a clampdown on tax dodging; investment in universal, free health and education; a global deal to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030; shifting the tax burden from income and consumption to capital and wealth; ensuring adequate safety-nets for the poorest, including a minimum income guarantee; equal pay legislation and promote economic policies to give women a fair deal; and the introduction of minimum wages and moves towards a living wage for all workers. Haldane said: \u201cIn highlighting the problem of inequality Oxfam not only speaks to the interests of the poorest people but also the wider collective interest: there is rising evidence that extreme inequality harms, durably and significantly, the stability of the financial system and growth in the economy. It slows development of the human, social and physical capital necessary for raising living standards and improving wellbeing. That penny is starting to drop among policymakers and politicians.\u201d The report found that inequality between countries had widened rapidly between 1980 and 2002, before narrowing slightly due to the rapid growth in China. But it said that inequality had risen within countries, so that seven out 10 people lived in nations where the gap between rich and poor was greater than it was 30 years ago. \u201cExtreme inequality has exploded across the world in the last 30 years, making it one of the biggest economic, social and political challenges of our time. Age-old inequalities on the basis of gender, caste, race and religion \u2013 injustices in themselves \u2013 are exacerbated by the growing gap between the haves and have-nots,\u201d the report said. \u201cOxfam\u2019s decades of experience in the world\u2019s poorest communities have taught us that poverty and inequality are not inevitable or accidental, but the result of deliberate policy choices.

      "bodyText": "As investors waited for the US Federal Reserve to end its monthly bond buying programme, the mood remained cautious. A small decline on Wall Street as Europe closed took some of the earlier shine off, and disappointing news from Total and Sanofi soured the mood a little. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 51.70 points or 0.81% higher at 6453.87 Germany\u2019s Dax was up 0.16% at 9082.81 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.05% lower at 4110.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 1.64% to 19,157.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.41% at 10,247.8 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 20.56 points or 0.12% lower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up the blog for the evening. Thank\u2019s for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The US central banker who popularised the term \u201cirrational exhuberence\u201d is forecasting the end of QE will cause market turmoil. According to Bloomberg: Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said he doesn\u2019t think the Fed can unwind years of extraordinary stimulus without causing turmoil in financial markets. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible,\u201d Greenspan said during an event today at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, responding to a question about the likely market impact of the Fed\u2019s exit. Full story here: Greenspan Sees Turmoil as QE Boost to Markets Unwinds Ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, Capital Economics says that QE will probably be ended but the central bank\u2019s forward guidance is unlikely to be altered just yet. Meanwhile forthcoming figures are expected to emphasise the disparity between the US and European economies. Capital Economics said: While the recent market volatility should not have prevented the Fed from announcing an end to its asset purchases at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, it does mean the Fed is unlikely to alter its forward guidance until December\u2019s meeting. Most officials agree that they need to alter the phrase that rates will not be raised from near-zero until a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after the asset purchases end, but they are struggling to agree on an alternative form of words. Meanwhile, the Fed may have acknowledged the recent softening in the inflation outlook. This means it will have become a little less likely that the first rate hike will occur before June. The focus of the markets could soon return to the latest economic data and the large gap that has opened up between the performances of the US and the euro-zone. Figures to be released in the coming days should underline this divergence. Our calculations suggest that US GDP growth slowed only slightly in the third quarter to a still-robust 3.3% annualised, from 4.6% in the second quarter. The largest euro-zone countries will not release their GDP data until mid-November. However, figures released on Wednesday showed that Belgian GDP grew by just 0.2% quarter on quarter in the third quarter (around 0.8% annualised), barely any better than the 0.1% recorded in the second... Spanish GDP [is expected to be] still growing relatively quickly in the third quarter by euro-zone standards, but failing to pick up from the second. And timelier PMI data suggest the gap between the US and the euro-zone has only narrowed a little at the start of the fourth quarter. Of course, this is not a new story. Indeed, the underperformance of the eurozone economy to date has already been fully reflected in the euro exchange rate. This makes us wary of predicting a collapse in the value of the euro (as some have) on the basis of growth differentials alone. Nonetheless, the risks are still skewed towards further euro weakness, especially given the likelihood that the ECB will eventually be forced to implement full-blown QE in the face of the growing threat of deflation. Back to Tesco, and it\u2019s starting to feel like kicking someone when they\u2019re down. After news of the investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, Moody\u2019s is back to put the boot in. The ratings agency has just issued a report suggesting rival Morrisons is better placed than Tesco to narrow the price gap with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Sven Reinke, a vice president and senior analyst at Moody\u2019s and the author of the report said: We believe that Morrisons has a slightly better risk profile than Tesco, supported by its lower leverage, lower exposure to very large stores and decisive strategy of narrowing the price gap with the discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. The report concludes: While Tesco benefits from having a more geographically diversified business than Morrisons, the latter\u2019s store estate provides a large degree of operational and financial flexibility compared to Tesco\u2019s much higher exposure to troubled large, out-of-town hypermarkets. Morrisons has taken more decisive action in tackling the rising market share of the discounters to date than Tesco. Morrisons (Baa2 negative) has slightly better credit metrics than Tesco (Baa3, on review for downgrade). My colleague Angela Monaghan has put together six key charts covering the five year period of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s $4.5tn quantitative easing programme, expected to be brought to a halt this evening. Showing the growth of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, the effect on equities, the economic recovery, unemployment, bonds and inflation, the report can be found here: The Fed to call time on QE in the US US markets are fairly static, ahead of today\u2019s Fed announcement. The Dow Jones is flat at 17,005 points and the S&amp;P equally becalmed at 1,986 points. The major European markets are all up. FTSE +0.75% at 6,450 points France\u2019s CAC40 +0.31% at 4,125 points Germany\u2019s DAX +0.68% at 9,129 points With that, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Here is our latest Tesco story, with full background on the supermarket\u2019s accounting practices that led it to overstate its profits by \u00a3263m. Criminal investigation launched into Tesco\u2019s accounting Tesco has confirmed that the Serious Fraud Office has launched a criminal investigation into its reporting practices. The company has said it is co-operating fully with the SFO and will continue to do so. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is stopping its investigation, as the SFO takes over. What is the link between Tesco, the supermarket now facing a criminal investigation over an accounting scandal.... ... and Norway? It might not be immediately obvious, but the nordic state is one of the biggest investors in the UK supermarket group. And that is not a good thing for the people of Norway. Norway\u2019s $860bn sovereign wealth fund owns almost 7% of Tesco, which has dragged down the fund\u2019s performance. The fund reported flat returns in its third quarter, following poor performance of many of its stocks, especially Tesco. Yngve Slyngstad, chief executive of the fund, said the fund was \u201cin dialogue\u201d with Tesco\u2019s board, but declined to give the retailer advice. It is clear that our investment in the British company Tesco has performed particularly poorly in the course of the year . Last month renowned investor Warren Buffett said investing in Tesco had been a \u201chuge mistake\u201d. Source: Reuters Nobody should expect great drama when the Federal Reserve reveals its hand on financial stimulus later today. No post-meeting press conference is scheduled. The Fed will simply publish an announcement at 2pm local time (18.00 GMT). So what should Fed watchers be looking for? Helpfully, Bloomberg has published this guide to the policy statement, having polled 64 economists about their expectations. A clear majority (62 of 64) are convinced that the Fed will end its financial stimulus, while 80% expect the Fed to favour holding interest rate near zero for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after bond buying ends. Many also expect cautious language on employment despite a recent fall in worklessness to 5.9%: 64% of economists expect the committee to refer to \u201csignificant underutilisation of labor resources\u201d. But some economists think the Fed will steer clear of mentioning the weak state of the global economy, for fear of spooking investors. Most do not expect a significant reaction from markets to the widely-trailed ending of QE. Allan von Mehren at Danske Bank The market is already prepared for a dovish shift in this statement. Via FX Street Total has reported a fall in profits, as it becomes the latest oil major to be hit by the falling price of crude. France\u2019s second-largest oil company is on a cost-cutting mission under new chief executive Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, who replaced Christophe de Margerie, who died in a plane crash in Moscow earlier this month. Total posted profits of $3.56bn for June to September, a 2% fall, but better than analysts expected. Iain Reid of BMO said Pouyann\u00e9 had already driven costs down in his previous role in charge of refining. Much of the credit for that [cost cutting] goes to the incoming CEO, who has successfully lowered Total\u2019 breakeven point in the [downstream] division via his cost reduction initiatives. Sky News has published the details of their story on the criminal investigation into Tesco. It reports that the Serious Fraud Office could confirm as early as this week that it is opening an inquiry. The SFO is understood to have notified Tesco of its intention to formally investigate the issue in recent days, and is expected to trigger a stock exchange announcement by the supermarket giant. Still no comment from Tesco or the SFO. The number of people filing for bankruptcy has fallen by 19%, according to the latest official statistics. Companies are also less likely to go into administration. Here are the data headlines from the Insolvency Service: The number of company liquidations in England and Wales decreased by 11.7% compared with July to September 2013. The number of companies going into administration has fallen by 18.8%, while voluntary arrangements and receiverships also fell. The number of people who became insolvent in England and Wales decreased by 4.6% compared with July to September 2013, driven by a fall in bankruptcy orders (18.7%). Sky News is reporting that the Serious Fraud Office will open a criminal investigation into Tesco\u2019s profits overstatement. The SFO and Tesco have declined to comment. Not enough women study economics, which could affect how the country is run, according to academics at Southampton university. Women make up just 27% of economics students, despite being 57% of the undergraduate population in UK universities, according to the researchers. Mirco Tonin, lead author of the study, said This under-representation of women in economics degrees could have major implications in policy-making. Economists have an influential role in think tanks, ministries, central banks and international organisations, like the IMF and the World Bank. Part of the problem is that not enough girls study maths, but even those that do are less likely to take up the dismal science. Girls are less likely to have A-levels in maths than boys, and this could represent an impediment to applying for an economics degree. However, even among those who have studied maths, females are still less likely to apply for an economics degree than males, suggesting that differences in the choice of A-level subjects cannot explain the whole gap. Based on a random sample of administrative data covering all university applications in 2008, the researchers found no discrimination against females in the university application process. They argue that cultural factors are holding young women back from studying economics. Female under-representation is also likely to contribute to the gender pay gap, because economics graduates tend to receive relatively high earnings. Souce: Press Association Economists have been raking over what the latest Bank of England lending data tells us about the state of the UK economy. First, business lending Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, described the dip in net bank lending to non financial companies as disappointing. Nevertheless, the underlying trend in net bank lending to businesses is looking better, with an overall increase of \u00a31.33 bn in the third quarter compared to falls of \u00a33.84 bn in the second quarter... Overall, it does appear that underlying credit conditions for businesses are improving which is important for the economy\u2019s long-term health. The data also shows momentum has slipped in the housing market. Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics, thinks the current weak patch won\u2019t last much longer. The subdued mortgage market may reflect a regulatory clampdown on risky lending in June, but he does not expect approvals to stay at this level for long. Taking a step back from the regulatory environment, the macroeconomic backdrop is still supportive of a gradual recovery in lending. The economy is growing at a robust pace, and the employment rate continues to rise, which would usually be expected to boost mortgage activity. Furthermore, the threat of an imminent rise in interest rates is receding. In another sign that the housing market is cooling, UK lenders approved fewer mortgages in September. The Bank of England said that mortgage approvals for house buying fell to 61,267 in September, down from 64,054 in August - their lowest level since July 2013 and a bigger fall than forecast. Mortgage lending, which lags approvals, rose by \u00a31.8bn in September, compared to \u00a32.2bn in August. Lending to business fell by \u00a3710m and is 3.1% lower than last year. Turmoil in the boardroom at French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi. The company, France\u2019s second largest, has sacked its chief executive Chris Viehbacher, who had clashed with unions over plans to lay off hundreds of staff. The decision, announced this morning, comes one day after Sanofi warned that sales of its leading diabetes treatment would stall because of tough competition from rivals. Sanofi\u2019s shares lost 8% yesterday. Markets have reacted predictably to the ouster of Viehbacher: Sanofi\u2019s stock is down almost 4% today. As one unnamed Paris trader told Reuters This creates more uncertainty just after the group published results and outlook figures, which were not reassuring. Further reading:Sanofi chief Chris Viehbacher sacked in boardroom row The ONS data shows a familiar regional divide in worklessness. The north east of England has the highest proportion of workless households (21.2%), while the south east has the lowest (12.3%). n 2014, there were 305,000 households in which no adult has ever worked, up 1,000 from a year earlier. The percentage of households, where no one aged 16-64 has ever worked was unchanged at 1.5%. A helpful graphic from the ONS, showing the employment status of UK households. A workless household is one where no one aged 16 or over is in paid employment, a varied category encompassing carers, people with family commitments, students, retired people, people who cannot work because of sickness or disability. The ONS explains how the statistics have changed In 1996, the earliest point at which a consistent data is available, the percentage of workless households stood at 20.9%. Ten years later in 2006, two years before the economic downturn hit the UK, it had fallen to 17.3%. During the recent economic downturn it rose to a high of 19.2% in 2010. In 2014 it has fallen to 15.9%, the lowest since 1996. Excluding student households this trend remains the same; the workless rate fell from 20.6% in 1996 to 17.1% in 2006 and rose to 18.8% in 2010 before it began falling again, where it is now at 15.5%. The percentage of households where no adults work has fallen to the lowest level since records began, according to the Office for National Statistics. The ONS reported that 1.5m children are living in workless households, a fall of 132,000 on last year. Here are the headlines from the ONS worklessness report, which covers April to June: The percentage of households where no adults work was 15.9%, down 1.4 percentage points from a year earlier and the largest fall since comparable records began. The percentage of households where all adults work was 55.3%, up 1.5 percentage points from a year earlier. Of the regions in England and countries of the UK, the North East had the highest percentage of workless households at 21.2%, while the South East had the lowest at 12.3%. The percentage of households in which no adult has ever worked was 1.5%, the same as a year earlier. For everyone who enjoys random facts The Russian rouble has fallen to new all-time lows against the euro and the dollar, as tensions simmer in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine has condemned Russia\u2019s \u201cdestructive and provocative\u201d stance after Moscow recognised elections organised by pro-Russian separatists on Sunday, further complicating peace talks. On Wednesday the rouble fell 0.57% against the dollar to 42.71 and lost 0.66% against the euro. Analysts expect the central bank to announce a policy of a free-floating rouble on Friday. Germany\u2019s largest lender Deutsche Bank has chalked up a surprise loss, after legal costs reduced its earnings. The bank lost \u20ac92m ($117 million) over June to September, as heavy charges for expected fines and settlements cut into its revenues. The bank faces multiple investigations, from its alleged role in manipulating Libor, misselling mortgage-backed securities in the US and flouting US sanctions against Iran. On Tuesday the bank announced a management shakeup that will see its chief financial officer, Stefan Krause, move to a newly created post, where he will oversee strategy and cost-cutting. Marcus Schenck of Goldman Sachs has been drafted in to take over the CFO role. In other changes staff have been given new duties to beef up the bank\u2019s IT and internet banking. The New York Times\u2019 Deal Book says that the management changes are intended to help the bank cope with tougher regulations and allegations of wrongdoing. Litigation issues have been a major distraction for Anshu Jain and J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, the co-chief executives, as they have tried to defend the bank\u2019s position among global investment banks. Unseasonably warm weather is making life uncomfortable for the UK\u2019s clothing retailers. Next issued a profits warning this morning, after balmy weather meant it failed to sell enough winter coats and jumpers in September and October. In a statement to the City, Next cut its profit forecast for 2014 to a range of \u00a3750m to \u00a3790m, a 3% reduction on previous estimates. This still adds up to a profit increase of 8-14% for the retailer. Whilst a cool August meant that the season started well, this was more than offset by much weaker sales in September and October. Other big retailers are feeling the heat, as investors sell their stocks in anticipation of similar damage to profits. Next -3.1% M&amp;S -1.7% Debenhams -0.7% More troubled retailers, such as M&amp;S, could be facing even bigger problems. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said If Next have been mildly discomfited by the amazingly mild October weather, we suspect that the likes of M&amp;S and Debenhams have had bigger problem. The Bank of England will publish a raft of statistics at 9.30, including the latest data on lending. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets expects the latest data to provide further data of declining home lending. In the UK we\u2019ve also seen evidence of a slowdown in prices, and in lending as well, and this morning\u2019s latest credit numbers are likely to reinforce that. Mortgage approvals in September are expected to have slipped back to 62k from 64.2k, while consumer credit and net lending is also expected to have weakened. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. All eyes are on the US Federal Reserve, widely expected to announce the end of its financial stimulus programme later today. The US central bank is also expected to reinforce previous messages that interest rate hikes will not happen until well into 2015, in an attempt to avoid scaring the markets. Over the last five years the Fed has pumped almost $4.5 trillion into the US economy, but is now ready to signal an end to its bond-buying programme. The Fed has already been winding its latest QE3 programme down, from a regular $85bn of quantitative easing a month to a final $15bn. It has been retreating carefully, to avoid unsettling markets at a time when many parts of the global economy are fragile. When Fed policymakers hinted they might end financial stimulus in 2013, investors threw taper tantrums, selling off equities and dumping foreign currencies. TD Securities economist Millan Mulraine is expecting a soothing message from the Fed intended to counter market anxieties. The overall tone of the communique should feel dovish as the Fed counters the implied tightening in monetary conditions resulting from the strong dollar and leans against the potential fallout from the current global growth slowdown and disinflationary impulse. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\u2019s policy-setting group, is scheduled to release a statement at 2pm EST/ 18.00 GMT on Wednesday. As well as looking ahead to the Fed, we have several UK stories on our agenda. The Bank of England will publish mortgage approvals and credit data, that are expected to show lending has fallen. The ONS will publish reports on worklessness and business activity at 9.30. All that and more...",

Meanwhile forthcoming figures are expected to emphasise the disparity between the US and European economies. Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the recent market volatility should not have prevented the Fed from announcing an end to its asset purchases at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, it does mean the Fed is unlikely to alter its forward guidance until December\u2019s meeting. Most officials agree that they need to alter the phrase that rates will not be raised from near-zero until a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after the asset purchases end, but they are struggling to agree on an alternative form of words. Meanwhile, the Fed may have acknowledged the recent softening in the inflation outlook. This means it will have become a little less likely that the first rate hike will occur before June. </p> <p>The focus of the markets could soon return to the latest economic data and the large gap that has opened up between the performances of the US and the euro-zone. Figures to be released in the coming days should underline this divergence. Our calculations suggest that US GDP growth slowed only slightly in the third quarter to a still-robust 3.3% annualised, from 4.6% in the second quarter. The largest euro-zone countries will not release their GDP data until mid-November. However, figures released on Wednesday showed that Belgian GDP grew by just 0.2% quarter on quarter in the third quarter (around 0.8% annualised), barely any better than the 0.1% recorded in the second... Spanish GDP [is expected to be] still growing relatively quickly in the third quarter by euro-zone standards, but failing to pick up from the second. And timelier PMI data suggest the gap between the US and the euro-zone has only narrowed a little at the start of the fourth quarter.</p> <p>Of course, this is not a new story. Indeed, the underperformance of the eurozone economy to date has already been fully reflected in the euro exchange rate. This makes us wary of predicting a collapse in the value of the euro (as some have) on the basis of growth differentials alone. Nonetheless, the risks are still skewed towards further euro weakness, especially given the likelihood that the ECB will eventually be forced to implement full-blown QE in the face of the growing threat of deflation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5451059fe4b0d0b00d4d03ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-29T15:29:27.471Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back to Tesco, and it\u2019s starting to feel like kicking someone when they\u2019re down.</strong></p> <p>After news of the investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, Moody\u2019s is back to put the boot in.

      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office has launched a formal criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco, which led to a \u00a3263m profit overstatement at the UK\u2019s biggest retailer. The inquiry, which was confirmed by the watchdog on Wednesday will supercede an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City regulator which has been halted with immediate effect. It is not clear whether it will affect the launch of an inquiry by the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which is also being considered. \u201cTesco has been co-operating fully with the SFO and will continue to do so,\u201d the retailer said in a statement. Tesco\u2019s shares have nosedived since the retailer admitted last month that a whistleblower had identified an issue with the way it booked payments from suppliers. Just weeks after the arrival of new chief executive Dave Lewis, who was brought in to turnaround falling sales and profits at Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, a team of forensic accountants from Deloitte established that the estimate of first-half profits that Tesco gave the City back in August was artificially inflated by \u00a3263m. Deloitte said \u00a3118m of the figure related to the first six months of the current financial year but that \u00a3145m related to previous years. The inquiry triggered the suspension of eight senior executives, including Chris Bush, the head of the UK food business. None has yet been reinstated. Some analysts have speculated that increasingly desperate executives were pulling forward payments in order to paint a more flattering picture of the supermarket\u2019s finances. Last week, Lewis dismissed the suggestion that fraud was involved: \u201cNobody gained financially as a consequence of the overstatement of performance.\u201d Deloitte concluded that supplier payments had been pulled forward or deferred in a manner that was contrary to Tesco\u2019s accounting policies. It also found there had been similar practices in prior reporting periods and that the sums pulled forward grew period by period. The report is being shared with the FCA and FRC. Major suppliers to Tesco have also asked auditors to look into their dealings with the retailer, according to recent reports. The criminal investigation, first reported by Sky News, comes at a very difficult time for Tesco as it struggles to cope with a rapidly changing grocery market amid new competition from discount chains and the rising influence of online retailing. Shares in the group have halved in the past year as the retailer continues to lose market share while German discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to grow rapidly. Last week, Tesco revealed that first-half profits had plunged by 92%, to \u00a3112m, and declined to give any guidance on the full- year outcome. Chairman Sir Richard Broadbent has said he will step down next year. Bonus payments to former chief executive Phil Clarke and former finance director Laurie McIlwee have been withheld as investigations continue. Lewis has told staff he wants to see a change in culture at Tesco and has led the way by swapping his limo for the train in an effort to save money. Bonuses and long-term incentives at the group for current senior executives, including the CEO, are also under review.",

The banker inadvertently intruded into Alibaba\u2019s pre-IPO quiet period during a web seminar call, which forced RBC to pull out as one of the underwriters of the record-breaking flotation, forfeiting $2.5m in fees. \u201cDemand for shares of Alibaba are unbelievable. Unbelievable. Everybody wants to own it,\u201d the banker, John Taft, said in the webinar according to the Wall Street Journal. Taft, head of RBC\u2019s US wealth management division, said Alibaba \u201cmay appreciate in value significantly over time\u201d during the discussion titled \u201crestoring investor trust in Wall Street, with broker-dealers and investment advisers\u201d. However, Taft was speaking during Alibaba\u2019s pre-IPO quiet period. RBC said in a statement: \u201cAn employee unrelated to the Alibaba IPO process inadvertently made a comment about the transaction on an industry webinar during the period leading up to the offering. \u201cConsistent with our core values of putting our clients first and out of an abundance of caution, we voluntarily chose to withdraw from the IPO transaction. \u201cThe comment did not impact the offering, and our decision to withdraw in no way reflects on either Alibaba or the IPO transaction.\u201d The webinar discussion was held on 8 September, a week before Alibaba floated. Taft was correct, as there was huge demand for Alibaba\u2019s stock and the shares soared 38% to $93.89 on their debut. The shares have continued to rise since, and hit a record high of $100.50 on Tuesday briefly valuing the company at $250bn \u2013 more than Walmart. However, Alibaba\u2019s shares closed at $99.68, giving it a market capitalisation of $246bn but slightly less than Walmart\u2019s. Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s founder, has been named China\u2019s richest person with a $19.5bn fortune, according to Forbes Magazine. His wealth more than doubled from $7.1bn last year, when he was ranked eighth. \u201cWe have a dream,\u201d Ma said as he rang the opening bell to officially launch the flotation on the New York stock exchange last month. \u201cWe hope in the next 15 years the world changes because of us. We hope in 15 years people say this is a company like Microsoft, IBM, Walmart. They changed, shaped the world \u2026 We want to be bigger than Walmart.\u201d Ma claims to have got his inspiration from an unusual source: \u201cThe hero I had is Forrest Gump. I really like that guy \u2026 Every time I get frustrated, I watch the movie. \u201cI watched the movie again [before the float] telling me no matter what changed, you are you.

It warned that if warm weather carried on it could be forced to cut profit forecasts.</a> As the warm weather did continue, Next\u2019s sales rose by 5.4% against its original hopes of more than 10%.</p> <p>Lord Wolfson admitted that Next had been over optimistic about the prospects for the autumn after a enjoying very strong trading in August. \u201cIn hindsight we underestimated how much the weather was helping us in the summer and didn\u2019t anticipate it would be this warm now \u2013 20C at the end of October is unusual.\u201d</p> <p>He said the volatility in sales, with big falls throughout September and then increases in October suggested that Next\u2019s problems were caused by the weather rather than any problems with product or a sudden drop-off in consumer confidence. Wolfson added that the big falls in sales in September after big increases in August also demonstrated how shoppers\u2019 behaviour had changed so that they only bought clothing when they really needed it. \u201cThe day we sell coats is the day after it gets cold. Nobody goes out and buys a winter wardrobe these days,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Next cut its full-year profit expectations by about 3% to between \u00a3750m and \u00a3790m. That would still be an increase of between 8% and 14% on the previous year. Its top-of-range guidance was \u00a3815m early last month.</p> <p>Analysts raised concerns that the slow pace of sales would mean that many retailers could be forced into heavy discounting to clear stock ahead of Christmas. \u201cFor all that many [retailers] will have vowed to hold their nerves and not discount too soon this year, the pressure may be too much for some and we foresee a not dissimilar promotional Christmas emerging this year to last,\u201d said Jonathan Pritchard, an analyst at Oriel in a note.</p> <p>Wolfson said Next would not discount outside its usual sales days and he did not believe the market was any more promotional than last winter. \u201cThere was a huge amount of discounting going into Christmas last year and I\u2019m not sure there will be any more this year. It doesn\u2019t depend on how retailers are performing but how heavily they have bought stock for autumn winter and we don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>September was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/30/britain-driest-september-100-years\" title=\"\">driest since records began in 1910 and one of the warmest</a>. It followed an unusually wet August, which gave Next and other clothes retailers a good start to the new season but sales of coats and other winter goods have been tough since as many parts of the country have basked in warm sunshine.</p> <p>Next said that after returning \u00a3361m of surplus cash to shareholders, including \u00a3223m through special dividends, it does not plan to pay out further special dividends this year. It has made \u00a3138m of share buybacks this year and has the scope to buy more shares in the market though not above the top price of \u00a364.25 paid to date.</p>",

Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: \u201cIf Next have been mildly discomfited by the amazingly mild October weather, we suspect that the likes of M&amp;S and Debenhams have had bigger problems.\u201d Fashion chains including Marks &amp; Spencer, House of Fraser and New Look started offering discounts to lure customers in to stores only weeks after the new season\u2019s stock arrived on the shelves. Simon Wolfson, Next\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cLooking at the market I don\u2019t think anyone will be surprised by what we\u2019ve said today.\u201d The profit downgrade came after Next sent a shudder through fashion retailers at the end of September when it said summer-like temperatures had hit sales of winter items. It warned that if warm weather carried on it could be forced to cut profit forecasts. As the warm weather did continue, Next\u2019s sales rose by 5.4% against its original hopes of more than 10%. Lord Wolfson admitted that Next had been over optimistic about the prospects for the autumn after a enjoying very strong trading in August. \u201cIn hindsight we underestimated how much the weather was helping us in the summer and didn\u2019t anticipate it would be this warm now \u2013 20C at the end of October is unusual.\u201d He said the volatility in sales, with big falls throughout September and then increases in October suggested that Next\u2019s problems were caused by the weather rather than any problems with product or a sudden drop-off in consumer confidence. Wolfson added that the big falls in sales in September after big increases in August also demonstrated how shoppers\u2019 behaviour had changed so that they only bought clothing when they really needed it. \u201cThe day we sell coats is the day after it gets cold. Nobody goes out and buys a winter wardrobe these days,\u201d he said. Next cut its full-year profit expectations by about 3% to between \u00a3750m and \u00a3790m. That would still be an increase of between 8% and 14% on the previous year. Its top-of-range guidance was \u00a3815m early last month. Analysts raised concerns that the slow pace of sales would mean that many retailers could be forced into heavy discounting to clear stock ahead of Christmas. \u201cFor all that many [retailers] will have vowed to hold their nerves and not discount too soon this year, the pressure may be too much for some and we foresee a not dissimilar promotional Christmas emerging this year to last,\u201d said Jonathan Pritchard, an analyst at Oriel in a note. Wolfson said Next would not discount outside its usual sales days and he did not believe the market was any more promotional than last winter. \u201cThere was a huge amount of discounting going into Christmas last year and I\u2019m not sure there will be any more this year. It doesn\u2019t depend on how retailers are performing but how heavily they have bought stock for autumn winter and we don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said. September was the driest since records began in 1910 and one of the warmest. It followed an unusually wet August, which gave Next and other clothes retailers a good start to the new season but sales of coats and other winter goods have been tough since as many parts of the country have basked in warm sunshine. Next said that after returning \u00a3361m of surplus cash to shareholders, including \u00a3223m through special dividends, it does not plan to pay out further special dividends this year. It has made \u00a3138m of share buybacks this year and has the scope to buy more shares in the market though not above the top price of \u00a364.25 paid to date.",
