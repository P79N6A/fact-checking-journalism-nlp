    "webTitle": "An RBS 'bad bank' is not a bad idea. But George seems confused", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u00bbThe good news for George Osborne is that Lloyds shares have done well since his Mansion House speech. The stock has barely moved in the past two days \u2013 impressive in a soggy stock market after a big seller has announced its intentions. Demand from City institutions, which will be offered the first slug of shares, seems to be strong. The bad news is that a reverse-Midas touch has applied at Royal Bank of Scotland. Its shares are 12% lower than they were on Wednesday night, which is a drop of about \u00a34bn in real money. The reason is not hard to fathom. The City sees a communication shambles at the Treasury over RBS and thinks the chancellor is digging a deeper hole for himself via his belated openness towards the \"bad bank\" idea. As it happens, the \"bad bank\" model is well worth exploring \u2013 it may be the best way to make RBS a more competitive lender in the UK \u2013 but the numbers need to be crunched. The problem lies in the condition Osborne placed on the Treasury's study. \"We are not prepared to put more taxpayer capital into RBS as part of this process,\" he said. In the opinion of almost everybody who has looked at \"bad bank\" models, that pledge is probably a deal-breaker. Why? Well, towing away the assets at today's market valuations would crystallise a loss for RBS and create a capital hole that would need to be filled. And there's little hope of filling it by selling Citizens, the US retail bank. Buyers are not queueing to pay silly prices and a fire sale might create another capital hole. If there is a way of squaring the circle, it's not obvious. That is why most versions of how to create a \"bad bank\" involve full nationalisation as a first step. But Osborne has ruled that out. His stance is confused: he seems to be open to the principle of a \"bad bank\", but not to the most effective means of creating it. No wonder the City is also confused. Stephen Hester, the chief executive, was shoved out and RBS is suddenly a place where anything can happen, depending on the week's political breezes. In the circumstances, you can't blame the institutions for deciding to steer clear. Pain in Spain \u00bbThe merger of British Airways and Iberia has been a great success, said Willie Walsh, chief executive of the parent International Airlines Group. In fact, it is such a success that he is threatening to close Iberia. \"None of us wants to see Iberia disappear. However, that still remains a risk,\" he told the annual meeting this week. Welcome to the wacky world of flag-carrying airlines \u2013 a world where \"success\" is constantly redefined, invariably downwards. With hindsight, it's obvious that BA did a poor deal in January 2011 when it traded 46% of itself to get its hands on Iberia. Since then, the two airlines have flown in opposite financial directions. Last year, BA made an operating profit of \u20ac347m (\u00a3300m) and Iberia lost \u20ac351m. In effect, the Spanish airline lost money as fast as BA could generate it. Back in 2010, of course, the grumbling was the other way around. The Spanish thought the perfidious Brits, with their flying pension fund, were getting a bargain. No, they weren't. If the merger was being agreed today, the Spanish might be lucky to get a quarter of the combination. Of course, Walsh may yet succeed in making Iberia competitive, as he did with BA, in which case some of the fine words from 2010 about dominating the Spain-to-South America routes may start to become meaningful. But the task looks substantially harder. Look at the list of measures already undertaken: a 15% removal of capacity, 3,300 job losses, pay cuts of 11% followed by further reductions of 4%. That little collection was described by Walsh as merely \"a first step\" in restructuring Iberia. The road ahead looks very long. He's sticking to his forecast of group operating profits of \u20ac1.6bn in 2015, which would be a minor triumph. But the split in profits between the two halves of IAG will almost certainly be miles away from original expectations. Generous souls will say that BA had to do the Iberia deal. Its earlier attempt to buy KLM failed and it risked being isolated in Europe via a pincer movement led by Air France-KLM and Lufthansa. It's a point of view. The more persuasive argument is that BA would have been better off staying independent for a while longer and taking its chances on striking a deal later from a position of strength. Too late now. Taxing questions for Cadbury \u00bbYou were imagining things if you thought modern Cadbury was ever run by altruists living the Quaker dream. Remember the promotion that offered free basketballs to children who could eat half their weight in chocolate? Even so, the scale of tax avoidance by Cadbury, prior to its takeover by Kraft in 2010, is a shock. An FT investigation has uncovered the use of techniques that look aggressive even by the standards of yesteryear. All legal, no doubt, but all at odds with Cadbury's presentation of itself a model corporate citizen. It's crucial now that the directors of the time give an account of what they thought they were doing. Sir John Sunderland was chief executive and then chairman for part of the period. Ken Hanna was a finance director. Would they regard the techniques as acceptable today? It's not an idle question. Hanna is now chairman of the power-generation firm Aggreko and the car dealer Inchcape. Are Cadbury-style techniques still seen as legitimate? Time to speak up. Why worry about easyJet's new fleet? It is hard to understand why Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou is so upset about easyJet buying more aircraft. Far from being a \"vanity exercise,\" the order announced this week \u2013 135 aircraft from Airbus \u2013 looks a necessary piece of spending by a growing company that has always operated a modern fleet. Some 85 of the planes are intended to serve as replacements. For the expansionary element, easyJet is hardly shooting for the moon in projecting growth in revenues of 3% to 5%. In any case, there's flexibility in the order. But Haji-Ioannou is upset. Indeed, assuming he loses at the shareholder vote, he may sell part of his family's 37% stake, which is what he pledged to do in January if there was a new order. But selling shouldn't be a wrench. He and his siblings have \u00a31.8bn tied up in a single investment that has trebled in value in two years. It was probably time to lighten the load anyway.",

      "legallySensitive": "false", 
      "body": "<p>\u00bbThe good news for George Osborne is that Lloyds shares have done well since his Mansion House speech. The stock has barely moved in the past two days \u2013 impressive in a soggy stock market after a big seller has announced its intentions. Demand from City institutions, which will be offered the first slug of shares, seems to be strong.</p> <p>The bad news is that a reverse-Midas touch has applied at Royal Bank of Scotland. Its shares are 12% lower than they were on Wednesday night, which is a drop of about \u00a34bn in real money. The reason is not hard to fathom. The City sees a communication shambles at the Treasury over RBS and thinks the chancellor is digging a deeper hole for himself via his belated openness towards the \"bad bank\" idea.</p> <p>As it happens, the \"bad bank\" model is well worth exploring \u2013 it may be the best way to make RBS a more competitive lender in the UK \u2013 but the numbers need to be crunched.</p> <p>The problem lies in the condition Osborne placed on the Treasury's study. \"We are not prepared to put more taxpayer capital into RBS as part of this process,\" he said. In the opinion of almost everybody who has looked at \"bad bank\" models, that pledge is probably a deal-breaker.</p> <p>Why? Well, towing away the assets at today's market valuations would crystallise a loss for RBS and create a capital hole that would need to be filled. And there's little hope of filling it by selling Citizens, the US retail bank. Buyers are not queueing to pay silly prices and a fire sale might create another capital hole.</p> <p>If there is a way of squaring the circle, it's not obvious. That is why most versions of how to create a \"bad bank\" involve full nationalisation as a first step. But Osborne has ruled that out. His stance is confused: he seems to be open to the principle of a \"bad bank\", but not to the most effective means of creating it.</p> <p>No wonder the City is also confused. Stephen Hester, the chief executive, was shoved out and RBS is suddenly a place where anything can happen, depending on the week's political breezes. In the circumstances, you can't blame the institutions for deciding to steer clear.</p> <h2>Pain in Spain</h2> <p>\u00bbThe merger of British Airways and Iberia has been a great success, said Willie Walsh, chief executive of the parent International Airlines Group. In fact, it is such a success that he is threatening to close Iberia. \"None of us wants to see Iberia disappear. However, that still remains a risk,\" he told the annual meeting this week.</p> <p>Welcome to the wacky world of flag-carrying airlines \u2013 a world where \"success\" is constantly redefined, invariably downwards. With hindsight, it's obvious that BA did a poor deal in January 2011 when it traded 46% of itself to get its hands on Iberia. Since then, the two airlines have flown in opposite financial directions. Last year, BA made an operating profit of \u20ac347m (\u00a3300m) and Iberia lost \u20ac351m. In effect, the Spanish airline lost money as fast as BA could generate it.</p> <p>Back in 2010, of course, the grumbling was the other way around. The Spanish thought the perfidious Brits, with their flying pension fund, were getting a bargain. No, they weren't. If the merger was being agreed today, the Spanish might be lucky to get a quarter of the combination.</p> <p>Of course, Walsh may yet succeed in making Iberia competitive, as he did with BA, in which case some of the fine words from 2010 about dominating the Spain-to-South America routes may start to become meaningful. But the task looks substantially harder. Look at the list of measures already undertaken: a 15% removal of capacity, 3,300 job losses, pay cuts of 11% followed by further reductions of 4%. That little collection was described by Walsh as merely \"a first step\" in restructuring Iberia. The road ahead looks very long.</p> <p>He's sticking to his forecast of group operating profits of \u20ac1.6bn in 2015, which would be a minor triumph. But the split in profits between the two halves of IAG will almost certainly be miles away from original expectations.</p> <p>Generous souls will say that BA had to do the Iberia deal. Its earlier attempt to buy KLM failed and it risked being isolated in Europe via a pincer movement led by Air France-KLM and Lufthansa. It's a point of view. The more persuasive argument is that BA would have been better off staying independent for a while longer and taking its chances on striking a deal later from a position of strength. Too late now.</p> <h2>Taxing questions for Cadbury</h2> <p>\u00bbYou were imagining things if you thought modern Cadbury was ever run by altruists living the Quaker dream. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/apr/29/uknews\" title=\"\">Remember the promotion that offered free basketballs to children who could eat half their weight in chocolate?</a></p> <p>Even so, the scale of tax avoidance by Cadbury, prior to its takeover by Kraft in 2010, is a shock. An FT investigation has uncovered the use of techniques that look aggressive even by the standards of yesteryear. All legal, no doubt, but all at odds with Cadbury's presentation of itself a model corporate citizen.</p> <p>It's crucial now that the directors of the time give an account of what they thought they were doing. Sir John Sunderland was chief executive and then chairman for part of the period. Ken Hanna was a finance director. Would they regard the techniques as acceptable today? It's not an idle question. Hanna is now chairman of the power-generation firm Aggreko and the car dealer Inchcape. Are Cadbury-style techniques still seen as legitimate? Time to speak up.</p> <h2><strong>Why worry about easyJet's new fleet?</strong></h2> <p>It is hard to understand why Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou is so upset about easyJet buying more aircraft. Far from being a \"vanity exercise,\" the order announced this week \u2013 135&#xa0;aircraft from Airbus \u2013 looks a necessary piece of spending by a growing company that has always operated a modern fleet.</p> <p>Some 85 of the planes are intended to serve as replacements. For the expansionary element, easyJet is hardly shooting for the moon in projecting growth in revenues of 3% to 5%. In any case, there's flexibility in the order.</p> <p>But Haji-Ioannou is upset. Indeed, assuming he loses at the shareholder vote, he may sell part of his family's 37% stake, which is what he pledged to do in January if there was a new order. But selling shouldn't be a wrench. He and his siblings have \u00a31.8bn tied up in a single investment that has trebled in value in two years. It was probably time to lighten the load anyway.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Royal Bank of Scotland slumps 7% as FTSE falls again on Bernanke worries", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ben Bernanke spoke, and the markets shuddered. The US Federal Reserve chairman caused a rout on Thursday, not just in global equities but also bonds, gold, base metals, oil and any currency that was not the dollar, by indicating that America's huge stimulus package could start winding down this year. After a near 3% drop in the immediate aftermath of the Fed comments, the FTSE 100 fell another 43.34 points or 0.7% to close at 6116.17. This marked its lowest point since mid-January and its fifth consecutive weekly decline, the worst run since May 2011. And with a 10% fall since its peak on 22 May - when Bernanke last contrived to spook the markets - the index is officially in correction territory. Markets have been supported for months by central bank action to boost the global economy and the idea that Bernanke could be preparing to turn off the money taps - albeit with a number of caveats - was enough to unnerve investors. Adding to the Fed worries were figures from China showing a slowdown in manufacturing, which undermined commodity companies, and signs that the eurozone crisis was rearing its head again, as cracks appeared in the Greek coalition after the controversial decision to shut state broadcaster ERT. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said: Markets in both the UK and US initially opened in positive territory [but] the fall back into the red is a sign that the negative feelings from Wednesday's Fed meeting haven't dispersed just yet. [There was not] the excitement of Thursday but it probably sends just as clear a sign that investors aren't happy about the Fed's Damascene conversion to the supposed benefits of tighter monetary policy. Royal Bank of Scotland was the day's biggest faller, slumping 22p to 281.7p or more than 7% on growing uncertainty over the bank's future. Following the confusion over the resignation of chief executive Stephen Hester, came chancellor George Osborne's comments at Wednesday's Mansion House speech that the government would look at splitting RBS into a good and bad bank. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said: While such a split is by no means a certainty, we think the fact that it is being considered will still add to the near-term uncertainty around the shares on top of that created by the announcement that Stephen Hester will be leaving. If a split is agreed as the best way forward, we struggle to see how this will benefit existing minority shareholders as the government may need to inject more capital while there will also, in our view, be significant associated restructuring costs. Lloyds Banking Group, which Osborne signalled he wants to prepare for privatisation, lost 0.23p to 61p. Mining shares continued to lose ground. With silver and gold under pressure as the dollar rose, Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo fell 49.5p to 911p while BHP Billiton dropped 24p to 1704.5p. Telecoms companies came into the spotlight, with Vodafone seen as both predator and possible prey. The UK mobile phone company faces a bid battle with Liberty Global over Germany's Kabel Deutschland, and is expected to raise its offer for its target to around \u20ac7.5bn. But with US group AT&amp;T on the lookout for European assets, having reportedly already approached Spain's Telefonica, some believe Vodafone could come into its sights. Vodafone dipped 1.9p to 175.85p as analysts at Morgan Stanley cutting their target price from 225p to 210p, although they kept an overweight rating on the shares. BT, which fell sharply earlier in the week on news that chief executive Ian Livingston was quitting to join the government, added 3p to 307.4p after Citigroup raised its rating from neutral to buy with a 365p price target. The bank said BT's move into sport, including Premier League football, was likely to be more successful than the market currently expected. Analyst Simon Weeden said: We expect a combination of cost savings, progress at Global Services and in mobile, momentum in consumer triple play and longer-term prospects of faster dividend growth to drive the stock. But rival TalkTalk Telecom dropped 14p to 220.9p as Citi moved from neutral to sell, saying it could lose around 130,000 broadband customers to BT. Chip designer Arm continued to be hit by competition fears, falling 26.5p to 772.5p. Intel is entering its key tablet and smartphone market, with Arm's move into servers not certain to make up the difference. Now a new competitor is emerging in Nvidia, which unveiled plans to license its graphics technology to manufacturers of tablets and mobile devices. SABMiller slipped 13.5p to \u00a331 despite upbeat presentations in the UK and US from its Miller Coors business. Analyst Chris Wickham at Oriel Securities said: The overall trend in this guidance was positive with more optimistic expectations on volume which had previously been expected to be negative, stronger expectations on pricing and a modest improvement in margin trends. Based on our estimates, the recent sell-off \u2013 which hurt SABMiller more than UK FMCG \u2013 places the company's PE ratio back beneath 20 times. Add. Defensive shares were among the day's main risers, with Cillit Bang maker Reckitt Benckiser rising 52p to \u00a346.54 and Tate and Lyle adding 10.5p to 808p.",

      "body": "<p>Ben Bernanke spoke, and the markets shuddered.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve chairman caused a rout on Thursday, not just in global equities but also bonds, gold, base metals, oil and any currency that was not the dollar, by indicating that America's huge stimulus package could start winding down this year.</p> <p>After a near 3% drop in the immediate aftermath of the Fed comments, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell another 43.34 points or 0.7% to close at 6116.17. This marked its lowest point since mid-January and its fifth consecutive weekly decline, the worst run since May 2011. And with a 10% fall since its peak on 22 May - when Bernanke last contrived to spook the markets - the index is officially in correction territory.</p> <p>Markets have been supported for months by central bank action to boost the global economy and the idea that Bernanke could be preparing to turn off the money taps - albeit with a number of caveats - was enough to unnerve investors.</p> <p>Adding to the Fed worries were figures from China showing a slowdown in manufacturing, which undermined commodity companies, and signs that the eurozone crisis was rearing its head again, as cracks appeared in the Greek coalition after the controversial decision to shut state broadcaster ERT.</p> <p>Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Markets in both the UK and US initially opened in positive territory [but] the fall back into the red is a sign that the negative feelings from Wednesday's Fed meeting haven't dispersed just yet. [There was not] the excitement of Thursday but it probably sends just as clear a sign that investors aren't happy about the Fed's Damascene conversion to the supposed benefits of tighter monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> was the day's biggest faller, slumping 22p to 281.7p or more than 7% on growing uncertainty over the bank's future. Following the confusion over the resignation of chief executive Stephen Hester, came chancellor George Osborne's comments at Wednesday's Mansion House speech that the government would look at splitting RBS into a good and bad bank. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> <p>While such a split is by no means a certainty, we think the fact that it is being considered will still add to the near-term uncertainty around the shares on top of that created by the announcement that Stephen Hester will be leaving. If a split is agreed as the best way forward, we struggle to see how this will benefit existing minority shareholders as the government may need to inject more capital while there will also, in our view, be significant associated restructuring costs.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong>, which Osborne signalled he wants to prepare for privatisation, lost 0.23p to 61p.</p> <p>Mining shares continued to lose ground. With silver and gold under pressure as the dollar rose, Mexican precious metals miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> fell 49.5p to 911p while <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> dropped 24p to 1704.5p.</p> <p>Telecoms companies came into the spotlight, with <strong>Vodafone</strong> seen as both predator and possible prey. The UK mobile phone company faces a bid battle with Liberty Global over Germany's Kabel Deutschland, and is expected to raise its offer for its target to around \u20ac7.5bn.</p> <p>But with US group AT&amp;T on the lookout for European assets, having reportedly already approached Spain's Telefonica, some believe Vodafone could come into its sights.</p> <p>Vodafone dipped 1.9p to 175.85p as analysts at Morgan Stanley cutting their target price from 225p to 210p, although they kept an overweight rating on the shares.</p> <p><strong>BT</strong>, which fell sharply earlier in the week on news that chief executive Ian Livingston was quitting to join the government, added 3p to 307.4p after Citigroup raised its rating from neutral to buy with a 365p price target. The bank said BT's move into sport, including Premier League football, was likely to be more successful than the market currently expected. Analyst Simon Weeden said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We expect a combination of cost savings, progress at Global Services and in mobile, momentum in consumer triple play and longer-term prospects of faster dividend growth to drive the stock.</p> </blockquote> <p>But rival <strong>TalkTalk Telecom </strong> dropped 14p to 220.9p as Citi moved from neutral to sell, saying it could lose around 130,000 broadband customers to BT.</p> <p>Chip designer <strong>Arm</strong> continued to be hit by competition fears, falling 26.5p to 772.5p. Intel is entering its key tablet and smartphone market, with Arm's move into servers not certain to make up the difference. Now a new competitor is emerging in Nvidia, which unveiled plans to license its graphics technology to manufacturers of tablets and mobile devices. <strong>SABMiller</strong> slipped 13.5p to \u00a331 despite upbeat presentations in the UK and US from its Miller Coors business. Analyst Chris Wickham at Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The overall trend in this guidance was positive with more optimistic expectations on volume which had previously been expected to be negative, stronger expectations on pricing and a modest improvement in margin trends. Based on our estimates, the recent sell-off \u2013 which hurt SABMiller more than UK FMCG \u2013 places the company's PE ratio back beneath 20 times. Add.</p> </blockquote> <p>Defensive shares were among the day's main risers, with Cillit Bang maker <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> rising 52p to \u00a346.54 and <strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> adding 10.5p to 808p.</p>",

Its strategist Dr Vasileios Gkionakis said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The most likely scenario is a coalition government by prime minister Samaras\u2019 New Democracy and PASOK. The new coalition would retain 153 out of 300 seats in parliament, and further support is likely to come from four independent parliamentarians (Markopoulos, Soldatos, Loverdos and Aidonis).</p> <p>We think it is more likely than not that this new coalition government will not require a vote of confidence from the parliament. A cabinet reshuffle may take place, with PASOK possibly obtaining some key ministries. This reshuffle is most likely to happen in early July, after New Democracy\u2019s convention scheduled in 28-30 June. We do not think this will have a significant impact on markets, but some nervous trading and higher volatility could emerge as markets digest the news and assess the challenges that the coalition's wafer-thin majority faces in the future.</p> <p>At present, we attach a low probability to scenario in which Samaras sticks to his position on ERT and refuses any greater involvement of the PASOK in the government, inducing also Venizelos\u2019 party to pull out of the coalition and thus earlier elections.</p> <p>Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that the Troika may put some pressure on Samaras to avoid early elections, which would risk threatening the viability of the program and increase market uncertainty. Still, if such a scenario manifests, then we feel that a period of much increased uncertainty and higher volatility is very likely to resurface and threaten to deliver yet another blow to an already fragile risk appetite.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51c46c88e4b0b82accce367a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-21T15:08:56.908Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">EU finance ministers back calls for French pension reform</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>EU finance ministers have put more pressure on France to revamp its pension system and cut labour costs in return for getting longer to shrink its budget deficit to within EU limits.

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed and after a bright start, the mood turned sour again. The prospect of Ben Bernanke turning off the money taps continued to unnerve investors, while the chaos in Greece with splits in the coalition over the ERT closure reminded everyone the eurozone crisis is far from over. So to the closing scores: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 43.34 points or 0.7% lower at 6116.17 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 1.76% to 7789.24 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.11% lower at 3658.04 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB lost 1.89% to 15,254 \u2022 Spain's Ibex fell 1.56% to 7700 \u2022 In Athens the market slumped 6% to 830 amid worries about new elections Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 46 points or 0.3% lower. And on that note, as EU finance ministers drag the longest day into the longest night, it's time to shut up shop on what has been another tumultuous week. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back on Monday. Have a good weekend. The withdrawal of Democratic Left ministers from Greece's coalition government over the ERT chaos is not likely to lead to new elections, according to Unicredit. Its strategist Dr Vasileios Gkionakis said: The most likely scenario is a coalition government by prime minister Samaras\u2019 New Democracy and PASOK. The new coalition would retain 153 out of 300 seats in parliament, and further support is likely to come from four independent parliamentarians (Markopoulos, Soldatos, Loverdos and Aidonis). We think it is more likely than not that this new coalition government will not require a vote of confidence from the parliament. A cabinet reshuffle may take place, with PASOK possibly obtaining some key ministries. This reshuffle is most likely to happen in early July, after New Democracy\u2019s convention scheduled in 28-30 June. We do not think this will have a significant impact on markets, but some nervous trading and higher volatility could emerge as markets digest the news and assess the challenges that the coalition's wafer-thin majority faces in the future. At present, we attach a low probability to scenario in which Samaras sticks to his position on ERT and refuses any greater involvement of the PASOK in the government, inducing also Venizelos\u2019 party to pull out of the coalition and thus earlier elections. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that the Troika may put some pressure on Samaras to avoid early elections, which would risk threatening the viability of the program and increase market uncertainty. Still, if such a scenario manifests, then we feel that a period of much increased uncertainty and higher volatility is very likely to resurface and threaten to deliver yet another blow to an already fragile risk appetite. EU finance ministers have put more pressure on France to revamp its pension system and cut labour costs in return for getting longer to shrink its budget deficit to within EU limits. According to Reuters: The ministers backed the European Commission's detailed recommendations on how France should proceed with those reforms, despite Paris's instance that Brussels cannot \"dictate\" its policies. Recommendations by the Commission last month on the details of the reforms, and especially the pension system, hit a raw nerve, with President Francois Hollande insisting France would go at its own pace. EU finance ministers underscored the same message as the Commission on Friday, saying possible measures included increasing full-pension contribution periods and reviewing special schemes while avoiding an increase in employers' social contributions. \"The pension system will still face large deficits by 2020 and new policy measures are urgently needed to remedy the situation,\" finance ministers said in a statement. As we suggested earlier, the EU ministers could be in for a long night. From the FT's Peter Spiegel: After the earlier calm, markets appear to be getting a little rattled again. The FTSE 100 has turned negative and is now down 21 points, with Royal Bank of Scotland a big faller, down 6.8%. RBS, which could be split into a good bank/bad bank, was not helped by news of an increase in mortgage arrears in Ireland. Germany's Dax is down around 0.9% and France's CAC off 0.38%. Even Wall Street, which got off to a bright start, is down around 8 points. The mini-revival after Thursday's tumultuous falls now looks like the proverbial dead cat bounce.... Over in Cyprus, a proposed gas pipeline to Crete and then Greece or Italy will be one of the strategic projects eligible for EU financial support, according to Cypriot officials. Reuters reports: \"The European Union will include the East Med Pipeline in the revised list of projects of common interest within the Southern Corridor for gas,\" George Shammas, chairman of the Cyprus Energy Regulatory Authority, said. Cyprus Energy Minister George Lakkotrypis also said he had information the European Union would include the pipeline, although adding that Cyprus had to study the feasibility of the link. An official announcement on the outcome is expected next week, but European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said, following talks with the Azeri president in Brussels, he was confident both routes could ultimately be realised. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said on yesterday's US selloff: There is no escaping the fact that yesterday\u2019s falls could well have done some significant short term damage having broken through the key 1,600 level yesterday. The S&amp;P500 needs to get and close back above this level fairly quickly or we could well see a further fall back towards the 1,536 level and the April lows over the coming weeks. And on that note, I'm handing over to may colleague Nick Fletcher. After two days of selling, Wall Street has started the day up slightly. Dow Jones up 0.4% at 14,812 Nasdaq up 0.1% at 3,367 S&amp;P 500 up 0.5% at 1,597 With all the noise from Greece about the split in the coalition, there was a glimmer of good news. The IMF managing director David Lipton has said they will not suspend Greek funding, as previously thought, and Athens has until July to come up with an agreement on its bailout programme (made slightly harder by the reduced majority the government has). The suggestion the IMF could without funds came after it was suggested part of Greece's financing broke ECB rules, leaving the creditors worried over future lending. The EU finance ministers have agreed to extend the maturity dates for Ireland and Portugal's loans from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) for an extra seven years, from twelve-and-a-half years to nineteen-and-a-half years. The full statement is here The new Greek government would still just about have a majority following the resignation of Democratic Left ministers. Apologies for suggesting it would be a minority earlier. As you digest the news spewing out of Greece, do go take our poll on whether the markets overreacted to Bernanke's call for a tapering off of QE by the US Federal Reserve. The votes so far show more readers think the markets did overreact, but there's still time to vote here. Seemingly, Vladimir Putin agrees with the majority of our readers and has told a press conference he's holding with Angela Merkel that Bernanke was right to make his announcement. Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis said in a statement that the country should avoid a new election and that his party would continue to back reforms within a European framework. The Democractic Left party in Greece has confirmed it will withdraw its ministers from the Greek government, forcing a reshuffle. No word from its coalition partners. A spokesman said On the basis of developments and the prime minister's policies, the Democatric Left has decided to withdraw its ministers and general secretaries from government. However, the party could still vote with the government on key issues and the remaining coalition parties could continue as a minorty administration. A war of words has broken out between Germany and Turkey over the current protests in Istanbul. It all started when Angela Merkel said the crackdown on protestors was \"appauling\". Yesterday, Turkey's minister for relations with the EU, Egemen Bagis, accused Merkel of blocking further talks on the country's intentions to join the EU because she was looking for domestic political material for her elections And now, the comments have led to the Turkish ambassador being summoned to the German foreign office for a dressing down this afternoon. A German foreign office spokesman called the comments \"unacceptable\" and claimed Germany's decision to block talks with Turkey were due to \"techinical reasons\" rather than in retaliation over the protestor crackdown. Robert O\u2019Daly, Turkey and Eurozone analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, suggested the setback to leave Turkey's EU ambitions in tatters. EU condemnation of the police crackdown on the anti-government protests in Turkey and the Erdogan government's aggressive reaction to the EU's criticism has caused an abrupt cooling of Turkey-EU relations, undoing all the painstaking work of the last 12 months to revive Turkey's EU accession negotiations after three years in the doldrums. In the current climate and with major elections taking place in Germany later this year and in Turkey in 2014-15, reviving Turkey's EU membership negotiation process will be a tough challenge. Until now neither Turkey nor the EU has wanted to put an end to it, but neither side has been prepared to go the extra mile to provide real momentum. Avoiding a complete breakdown now will require a huge effort. A majority of lawmakers for Greece's Democratic Left party want to leave the coalition government, following a meeting (see 9.16am and 10.34am) An official from the party told Reuters: A strong majority of the parliamentary group and the executive committee are backing [leader Fotis] Kouvelis's propsal to withdraw minsters from the government. We will bring you any follow up reaction from their coalition partners when it arrives. Also, we are guessing, but perhaps its a Greek political thing to turn up to a briefing with your packet of cigarettes on top of your notes when talking to the press. EU leaders in Luxembourg are holding a day (and probably night) of talks to create rules that force losses onto large savers when banks fail. Finance ministers want to work out how they can shut failed banks without causing panic or burdening taxpayers. According to the official press release, the Council will: be called on to agree on a draft framework for bank recovery and resolution -- a key element of the future banking union -- in order to allow negotiations to start with the European Parliament. And when they finish that: The Council is expected to close excessive deficit procedures for Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Romania, give notice to Belgium on measures to correct its deficit, extend the deadlines for Spain, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia to correct their deficits, and reopen an excessive deficit procedure for Malta. Sweden's finance minister said We are in for a very tough negotiation warning that a one-size-fits-all rule for all EU countries was \"dangerous\". A draft bill has suggests bank shareholders should suffer first, followed by bondholders and then savers. A new fund could also be set up to oversee new tighter rules. However, Sweden, Britain and France want individual countries to have a final say rather than following a blanket rule. Putting a happy spin on the talks, the European Commission's top economics official, Olli Rehn, said Midsummer is the longest day of the year so we have plenty of time. Matt Basi at CMC Markets UK asks whether the stablisation (FTSE now up 69 points) could be short lived. He said Much desk discussion this morning has been devoted to the nature of the move higher, with sceptics convinced that we\u2019re witnessing a dead cat bounce whilst more optimistic traders expect a leg higher following yesterday\u2019s shake out. The options expiry saw FTSE stocks bid higher during the mid-morning auction suggesting risk appetite remains in some quarters, which is reflected in the flow we\u2019re seeing on desk with over 60% of clients with FTSE index positions currently long. Reuters are reporting that Greece's Democratic Left party head Fotis Kouvelis has advised his lawmakers to withdraw the party's ministers from the coalition government over its decision to shut down the state broadcaster. An official said Kouvelis has recommended that the ministers of the Democratic Left withdraw. Two hours after opeing, the European markets continue to hold up well. The FTSE stands up 33 points at 6192 DAX up 17 points at 7946 CAC up 25 points at 3724 Meanwhile over in China, the central bank has been clashing with banks in an attempt to end informal lending which officials believe is being used for speculative trading. The banks have been using cheap official funds to finance a vast shadow banking market, which Beijing worries is siphoning credit from industry and creating asset-price bubbles. In an attempt to stem the lending, the People's Bank of China has stopped putting funds into the market to steady the interest rate, sending short-term interest rates up to 25% and higher. However, the rate mellowed today and fell to around 9% on the back of rumours that some major banks were helped out after asking for emergency funding. Barclays economist Yiping Huang said: One consensus among many government officials and policy advisers is that tough decisions on economic reforms could no longer be delayed and that taking some short-term pain is necessary for healthy long-term growth And Charlene Chu, senior director at Fitch, told Reuters: They are trying to take a different approach to rein in shadow banking activity. This new approach, where you are trying to tighten the funding in the system available for that type of credit, is much more effective, but it is also taking the market by surprise. China's cabinet said this week it was committed to reducing financial risks and ensuring that credit growth supported the real economy. The central bank does not want to cut the levels of reserves banks must hold, worried that bubbles could be formed, especially in the housing market. The rise in the Greek bond yields could be the start of a rise elsewhere due to the QE news from the US. Nicholas Spiro from Spiro Sovereign Strategy warned Eurozone peripheral debt markets are used to being in the eye of financial storms. Yesterday, however, they were the silent victims of the \"tapering terror\" convulsing the international investment community. Right now, southern European sovereign debt is the least of investors' concerns. Eurozone bond markets have become a derivative of investor perceptions of the timing, pace and consequences of the US Federal Reserve's exit from its third round of quantitative easing (QE). The \"Bernanke put\", or the perceived lack of it, has replaced the \"Draghi put\" as the main driver of market sentiment towards the eurozone. Mr Draghi needs the tapering debate like he needs a hole in the head. Not only does it undermine the perceived credibility and effectiveness of the ECB's bond-buying programme, it provides a foretaste of what's in store when the ECB itself starts to normalise policy - however distant a prospect that may be. Over in Greece, the Government's coalition could be about to lose one of its members. Leaders from the small Democratic Left party are currently meeting to decide if it should leave PM Anotonis Samaras's coalition, angry at the decision to to shut down the state broadcaster ERT last week. Samaras said I want us to continue together as we started but I will move on either way. Our aim is to conclude our effort to save the country, always with a four-year term in our sights. We hope for the Democratic Left's sopport. The unrest - coupled with the market volitility and threats from the IMF - sent ten year Greek bond yields to their highest since late April. They were up 70 basis points to 11.41%. Overnight the Nikkei rose 1.7%, recovering thanks to a weak yen against the dollar. The rise burned out early falls on the back of the QE announcement in the US. It rose 216 points, closing at 13,230 after falling as low as 12,703 in early trading. After weeks of falls, the Japanese market closed up 4.3% on the week. The first weekly rise for more than a month. As well as keeping an eye on the markets as they respond to yesterday's biggest fall in 18 months, we will keep an eye on the following: Over in China, we will bring you the latest on the rocketing interest rates, after government fears of excessive lending. And in Luxembourg EU ministers are meeting to discuss various plans to avoid further bailouts and fallouts. They could also approve Latvia's desire to join the Euro currency. The ministers will also be dealing with threats from the IMF that it is preparing to suspend aid payments to Greece unless Eurozone leaders stump up a \u20ac3-4bn shortfall, all at a time when the fragile Greek coalition looks on the brink of collapse. Good morning and welcome to another day of our live eurozone crisis rolling coverage, where it's heads down to see if the markets can recover after yesterday's violent reaction to the US Fed's warning at winding down QE. So far, so good, it would seem, as markets across Europe ticked up ever so slightly. FTSE 100 up 0.1% DAX up 0.2% CAC 30 up 0.5% IBEX up 0.4% FTSE MIB flat",

    "webTitle": "Windfall tax on Swiss bank accounts helps reduce government borrowing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A tax windfall from Swiss banks has helped the UK post a bigger improvement in its public finances than expected, giving a boost to George Osborne ahead of his spending review next week. But analysts warned that the shrinking deficit was largely down to one-off factors rather than longer-term changes. There was a deficit of \u00a38.8bn in May, almost half the \u00a315.6bn a year earlier, on the government's preferred measure for public borrowing, which excludes some of the effects of bank bailouts. The May figure was also well below the \u00a312.6bn forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. Publishing the figures, the Office for National Statistics said the deficit had been cut by two temporary factors: there was a reduction of \u00a33.9bn thanks to receipts from the Bank of England's quantitative easing bond purchases and of \u00a33.2bn due to be received from retrospective tax payments by Swiss banks. That windfall follows a deal with Switzerland in January on the tax of Britons with undeclared Swiss bank accounts. Under the agreement, banking deposits of UK residents held in Swiss banks will become liable for taxation. The flattering effect on the public finances will be welcomed by the government as it seeks to show it is clamping down on tax avoidance. But without it, economists said, the picture is barely one of a marked turnaround. \"The underlying deficit was fairly close to last year's. With borrowing still at very high levels, next week's spending review is a reminder of how much austerity still lies ahead,\" said Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. \"Indeed, the review [covering only 2015/16] will detail how only a fraction of the pain that still lies ahead will be achieved. Accordingly, the economic recovery still faces an uphill battle to establish itself against the continued drag from the public sector.\" Still, many analysts say the government could achieve its near-term deficit-cutting goals based on the latest numbers. \"It is, of course, very early days in the fiscal year and no doubt many twists and turns lie ahead. But it currently looks increasingly likely that Chancellor George Osborne will meet his fiscal targets for 2013/14 and could very well undershoot them,\" said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight. The Treasury said the latest data showed its policies were working. \"The government is taking tough decisions to deal with the deficit: today's data shows that borrowing is lower than was previously predicted,\" said a spokesman. But Labour highlighted the ONS data on the full tax year, just ended, that showed public sector borrowing actually edged up on a year earlier, once the many one-off factors are stripped out. \"With borrowing now confirmed as rising last year, these figures are another damaging blow to George Osborne's economic credibility,\" said Chris Leslie, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury. \"The reason why the chancellor is failing to get the deficit down is because he has failed to boost living standards and economic growth.\" Business groups are urging Osborne to use his spending review on Wednesday to bring in more programmes to boost the economy and employment. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: \"Next week's spending review gives the chancellor an opportunity to reallocate resources, focusing on measures to boost growth such as infrastructure investment, while continuing to make real cuts in current spending. Any room for manoeuvre must be used to help create jobs and drive economic growth.\"",

The survey showed that a quarter of households are interested in BT Sport and 13% are prepared to switch broadband supplier or pay to get it on top of those with BT broadband already who can get it for free. </blockquote> <p>As a result Citi has upgraded BT to buy from neutral with a 365p price target. It said:</p> <blockquote> We expect a combination of cost savings, progress at Global Services and in mobile, momentum in consumer triple play and longer-term prospects of faster dividend growth to drive the stock. <br> </blockquote> <p>Citi kept its buy rating on BSkyB, saying that around a million Sky subscribers could take BT Sport but this is not materially different than its original estimates.</p> <p>But it cut its rating on <strong>TalkTalk Telecom</strong> from neutral to sell:</p> <blockquote> Our survey broadly bears out management's line that its customers are less interested in BT Sport but that is not the same as saying it has no exposure. Based on the survey, around 28% of TalkTalk's broadband customers have Sky TV and among those that do not 9% say that they would switch or pay to get BT Sport. Losing even half of those equate to around 130,000 customers. We downgrade our estimates consistent with guidance for higher TV costs and slower net cost savings and reduce our forecasts for broadband customers. As a result we see downside to consensus and downgrade the stock to sell with a 200p ex dividend target price. </blockquote> <p>So BT - which fell back earlier in the week on news of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/19/bt-chief-executive-ian-livingston-leaves\" title=\"\">the departure of chief executive Ian Livingston for government </a>- has risen 8.1p to 312.5p, BSkyB is up 12p at 787p but TalkTalk is down 13.8p at 221.1p.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Ahead of the forthcoming Premier League football season, there has been much talk about how BT will fare now the company has dived into the sports rights market. There had been concerns that BT's decision to battle it out for subscribers with BSkyB and Virgin Media on a new battlefield for the telecoms company could be risky. But in a new note, analysts at Citigroup said BT's sports offering could be a bigger positive for the company than the market realises, based on a survey conducted by the bank. Analyst Simon Weeden said: Citi's bespoke survey of 1,365 UK household decision makers asked 10 questions designed to establish interest levels in BT Sport across a broad range of demographics and existing suppliers.

As a result Citi has upgraded BT to buy from neutral with a 365p price target. It said: We expect a combination of cost savings, progress at Global Services and in mobile, momentum in consumer triple play and longer-term prospects of faster dividend growth to drive the stock. Citi kept its buy rating on BSkyB, saying that around a million Sky subscribers could take BT Sport but this is not materially different than its original estimates.

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest online bookmaker, Bet365, has seen profits leap by a third to \u00a3148m, despite the family-owned business swallowing \u00a331m of losses from its controlling interest in Stoke City football club. Bet365, started from a car park in Stoke 13 years ago and best known to football fans for its TV adverts featuring Ray Winstone promoting live \"in-play\" bets during half-time commercial breaks, saw nearly \u00a320bn wagered on its website in the year to March 2013, making it larger than sites operated by Ladbrokes and William Hill combined. Despite its low profile, it is the biggest private employer in Stoke, and its workforce rose by almost 19% to more than 2,500 during the year. The business, based in unassuming offices beside a run of derelict pottery factories, paid corporation tax of \u00a331m. The online operations of William Hill and Ladbrokes UK moved offshore several years ago. Just over half of Bet365 shares are owned by founder Denise Coates, the daughter of Stoke City's chairman, Peter Coates. She has emerged as Britain's most successful self-made businesswoman in recent years. She received a CBE in acknowledgment of her success in 2011. Coates and her fellow shareholders received dividends of \u00a315m last year, the latest accounts reveal, half of which went to her, with the balance largely to her brother John and father Peter. In addition, Denise Coates received pay and bonuses last year of \u00a35.4m. In contrast, Angela Ahrendts, the American chief executive of Burberry and the highest-paid woman on the board of a publicly listed company, received cash and shares worth \u00a310m for the year to March. In the past five years, Bet365 has paid out dividends totalling \u00a3130m, half of which have gone to Coates, cementing her reputation as one of Europe's most successful dotcom entrepreneurs. The company also has \u00a3430m in cash reserves on its balance sheet. In a rare interview last year, Coates told the Guardian how she has, on occasion, had to correct some people who had assumed that her father, a well-known businessman, ran the group. \"I think there have been false assumptions made about my role,\" she said. \"There was a misunderstanding that as Dad was the chairman of Stoke, he ran Bet365 \u2013 something Dad was always clear that he didn't do.
