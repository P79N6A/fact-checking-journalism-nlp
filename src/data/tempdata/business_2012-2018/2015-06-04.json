      "bodyText": "And finally, a Greek spokesperson is saying that the Hollande, Merkel and Tspiras telephone call tonight was constructive. But Tsipras has also insisted that the creditors\u2019 plan cannot be the basis for an acceptable deal. So he\u2019s sticking to his guns, and his own, 47-page proposal. We\u2019ve had a lot of \u201cconstructive\u201d calls since this crisis began, but yet no permanent solution has actually been built. So let\u2019s see what tomorrow brings. Another big day - with Tsipras due to address the Greek parliament on the crisis, from 6pm local time, or 4pm BST. How will the Greek people react to the latest deadlock? Will the markets panic? See you on Friday morning to find out..... Until then, thanks and goodnight. GW ...otherwise we\u2019ll catch in the morning. Greek media say that Alexis Tsipras has ended his telephone call with Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande. Fingers crossed for some details soon.... Greece\u2019s leftist-led government has just issued one of its famous non-papers, saying there is no way it will accept the creditors\u2019 proposed demands. It was sent as Alexis Tsipras was holding a teleconference call with the German and French leaders, and declared: \u201cThe proposal presented by the institutions in Brussels yesterday, Wednesday, contains extremist positions that cannot be accepted by the Greek government. They do not even correspond to the changes that have been accepted by the Brussels Group!\u201d it said referring to negotiators. \u201cThey haven\u2019t taken a step back independently of the fact that over the past four months the two sides had converged on reforms which the Greek government included in its own proposal.\u201d Did creditors ultimately want a mutually beneficial solution, the government statement asked. \u201cIf these proposals were accepted it would continue the tragic mistake of the [previous] government of Samaras/Venizelos which lead the country to the strategic impasse of austerity.\u201d Over in Athens, insiders are saying that an irate Christine Lagarde has not responded to Greece\u2019s request to bundle debt repayments this month - and is unlikely to tonight. Helena Smith reports from Athens The IMF chief Christine Lagarde has not responded to the Bank of Greece and is not expected to tonight, we have just been told. \u201cShe\u2019s annoyed that we reassured her earlier and was taken by surprise,\u201d our insider tells us. \u201cThe Bank, however still expects a positive reply only tomorrow.\u201d We\u2019ve splashed tomorrow\u2019s paper on the latest Greek developments: Here\u2019s a flavour: Greece has moved closer to default and possible exit from the eurozone after telling the International Monetary Fund it would not be making a debt repayment of \u20ac300m (\u00a3219m) due on Friday. A crisis that has been going on for more than five years entered a new phase when Athens surprised the IMF by saying it intended to bundle up four payments in June totalling \u20ac1.6bn and make them all at the end of the month. The move came as the Greek government reacted angrily to what was seen as an ultimatum from its creditors \u2013 including the IMF \u2013 that demanded further austerity and unpopular reforms to VAT, pensions and wage bargaining as the price for \u20ac7.2bn in fresh financial help. Although Greece\u2019s financial position has become increasingly serious in recent months, Athens had the ability to make the \u20ac300m payment and the country\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, gave the IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, an assurance earlier this week it would be made on time. Asked about the repayment due on Friday, Lagarde told reporters: \u201cThe payment had been honoured and will be honoured,. I think his words were, \u2018Do not worry,.\u2019 I\u2019m confident that will continue to be the case.\u201d Instead, the decision to delay payments appears to be a show of defiance by Athens against what it sees as unacceptably harsh terms being demanded by its creditors. This increases the chances of Greece defaulting on its debts, losing the support for its weak financial sector from the European Central Bank, and eventually being forced to leave the single currency..... Greece makes the front page of tomorrow\u2019s FT..... Athens sources are telling us that the Bank of Greece is still waiting for a response from the IMF to the news that it will be bundling this month\u2019s payments. \u201cThe Bank expects the reply to be positive as there is a precedent,\u201d said one well-placed insider. \u201cWe have enough for the payment but Tsipras wants to save up for salaries and pensions.\u201d Analysts this evening said the decision to miss the loan installment was also motivated by Tsipras\u2019 determination to look as if he is playing tough. \u201cIt is aimed purely at internal consumption, not foreigners,\u201d Christos Memis, chief executive of the news portal Protagon told me this evening . \u201cHe is dramatising things deliberately to show Greeks he is putting up a robust defense. Come mid-June he will accept the deal. At some point he will get rid of the hardliners in his party and move to the centre left who voted him into office. That is the plan.\u201d But that\u2019s a risky game. The prime minister, who is expected to address Syriza\u2019s steering board on Friday, is facing heavy pressure from hardliners to default. \u201cRupture [from the EU] has become the necessary solution,\u201d the Left Platform, which represents the party\u2019s militant wing, opined on its website. It added: \u201cDevelopments on the level of negotiations have shown in the most emphatic way that the so-called \u201cinstitutions\u201d are aiming for an agreement of devastation for the Greek people and the country, immovable in the logic [of pursuing] the neo-liberal model of austerity.\u201d Greek media reckon the leaders of Greece, Germany and France could hold a conference call in 15 minutes time to discuss the situation. Fears over Greece helped to send shares down on Wall Street. Trading just ended for the day, with the main indices all losing ground. Here\u2019s the damage: DOW JONES UNOFFICIALLY CLOSES DOWN 164.45 POINTS, OR 0.91 PERCENT, AT 17,911.82 S&amp;P 500 UNOFFICIALLY CLOSES DOWN 17.56 POINTS, OR 0.83 PERCENT, AT 2,096.51 NASDAQ UNOFFICIALLY CLOSES DOWN 38.72 POINTS, OR 0.76 PERCENT, AT 5,060.51 European stock markets had closed (in the red) before news of Athens\u2019 plan broke; Friday could be a lively day in the City, depending how investors see the situation when they arrive at their desks. Rumblings in Brussels: If this is a political move by Tsipras, then it must be designed to pacify his Syriza party. In particular, the party\u2019s militant faction, which represents around a third of its total MPs and is known as the Left Platform. It says rupture with Europe is now the only option. Over to Helena Smith in Athens. The faction wants elections because it believes Syriza would win the polls hand down. Then, one member says: \u201cWe would be in a position to decide what course the country should take.\u201d Analysts are describing Greece\u2019s plight as \u201cterrifying\u201d - meaning the country\u2019s future is \u201cunforeseeable\u201d. \u201cThe country is in a mess and I don\u2019t know how it is going to get out of it,\u201d the political commentator Alexis Papachelas told SKAI News. \u201cWhat is terrifying is that creditors truly believe that what they have offered is very flexible, very tame.\u201d Just 20 hours ago, Alexis Tsipras was assuring reporters they needn\u2019t worry about Friday\u2019s IMF bill. We\u2019ve made bigger payments already, he breezily declared, after his talks with Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels. This makes the subsequent u-turn all the more surprising, and potentially incendiary. As Mujtaba Rahman, head of European analysis at the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, put it to the FT: \u201cThis move is almost unprecedented and based on Tsipras\u2019s comments yesterday unexpected. It unnecessarily raises the stakes and will further undermine the goodwill of Greece\u2019s creditors.\u201d Some Greek media are reporting that Athens could have found the funds owed to the IMF, but chose not to transfer them to Washington. Greeks are digesting the news that they are only the second country after Zambia to bundle its IMF repayments. SKAI News on its flagship news programme tonight is reporting that Christine Lagarde was taken aback by the Greek government\u2019s request for consolidation of its debt repayment. Why? Because Athens had guaranteed only yesterday that the payment would be made in full, reports Helena Smith in Athens. \u201cAddressing reporters earlier today, Mrs Lagarde said she did not believe Greece would make such a move because she had been told by officials at the finance ministry than Athens would make the loan installment,\u201d the channel\u2019s Washington-based correspondent Katerina Soko said. Greece\u2019s request comes on a day when many in the the governing Syriza party have railed against the country\u2019s creditors. As we reported earlier, deputy social security minister, Dimitris Stratoulis said lenders were pushing a \u201ca disgraceful and dishonourable agreement\u201d on the Greek people. And that was relatively mild. Alexis Mitropoulos, a deputy parliament speaker and senior official within Syriza told Mega TV that Jean-Claude Juncker had presented a \u201cmost vulgar, most murderous, toughest plan.\u201d when he met Alexis Tsipras last night. Greece\u2019s long-running debt crisis has entered a \u201cnew and dangerous phase\u201d tonight, says economics editor Larry Elliott: Athens said it would be bundling together four debt payments due to the IMF into one and would settle up on 30 June. The move is allowed under IMF rules, but the Washington-based Fund was taken by surprise by the decision, which came just hours after its managing director, Christine Lagarde, said she expected Greece to pay the \u20ac300m due on 5 June. Countries are only supposed to bundle up their debts if they face administrative problems from making multiple payments, but Greece\u2019s decision not to pay on time provides an insight into the country\u2019s desperate financial position. Here\u2019s the full story: In Athens media reports are suggesting that Tsipras will now meet EU president Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday, says my colleague Helena in Athens. If the Greek leader is to call for early elections, he will likely do so on Monday. But elections would necessarily have to be held in early July - thereby missing the deadline to repay the IMF debts at the end of the month. If Greece can\u2019t or won\u2019t pay tomorrow, can we be confident it will repay the IMF at the end of June? It all depends on whether Athens can reach a deal with its lenders in time. There are 7.2bn euros of bailout funds waiting to be unfrozen, if an agreement is reached before the bailout programme expires at the end of this month. But talks between prime minister Tsipras and EC president Juncker last night failed to reach a deal; pensions, labour market reforms and VAT rates are all sticking points (as regular readers know well). Without compromise, the bailout funds won\u2019t be unlocked in time Although countries are allowed to bundle their IMF repayments together, this is the first time in decades that it\u2019s actually happened. According to the IMF, Zambia did it in the 1980s, meaning Greece is joining a fairly exclusive club. Greek government sources are confirming that Friday\u2019s loan installment will not be paid, Helena Smith reports from Athens. Greek officials say that the IMF informed them late last night that the country would be able to \u201cbundle up\u201d all four of the 1.6bn euro worth of loan instalments it owes the Washington-based body and pay the sum at the end of the month. Here\u2019s a statement from the IMF. Chief Spokesman Gerry Rice said: The Greek authorities have informed the Fund today that they plan to bundle the country\u2019s four June payments into one, which is now due on June 30. Under an Executive Board decision adopted in the late 1970s, country members can ask to bundle together multiple principal payments falling due in a calendar month (payments of interest cannot be included in the bundle). The decision was intended to address the administrative difficulty of making multiple payments in a short period. A growing number of reports suggest that Greece will not after all make tomorrow\u2019s \u20ac300m payment to the International Monetary Fund, but will in fact bundle up all the June payments with a view to handing over \u20ac1.6bn at the end of the month: Bonds were falling, the euro rising and markets tumbling, as the Greek crisis rumbles on, writes Nick Fletcher. The first two saw a slight reversal as the day progressed, helped by some better than expected US jobless claims ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. But shares remained in negative territory, with the closing scores showing: The FTSE 100 finished down 91.22 or 1.31% at 6859.24 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.69% to 11,340.60 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.93% lower at 4987.13 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.15% to 23,336.50 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.08% at 11,146.1 The Athens market lost 1.32% to 827.12 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 110 points or 0.6% lower. Here\u2019s Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s interview with Ed Conway of Sky News, in which he declines to say when Greece might run out of cash to pay the IMF: Full marks for impertinence, Ed! Euclid Tsakalotos, the economist who leads the Greek negotiating team has expressed his \u2018shock\u2019 over the proposals creditors presented last night. More on Channel 4 News tonight, from 7pm. It\u2019s raining leaks! The five-page list of proposals which Greece\u2019s creditors have drawn up has just gone public. It is broken down into eight key areas. Here are some key points: 1) Fiscal: Primary surpluses of 1% of GDP in 2015, 2% in 2016, 3% in 2017 and 3.5% of GDP in 2018. That\u2019s a little tougher than the Greek proposal. 2) Social measures: Creditors would launch a social welfare review, leading to the gradual rollout of a guaranteed basic income. 3) VAT reforms: Making 23% the standard rate, eliminating various exemptions, and only allowing food, medicine and hotels to be on a 11% rate. That\u2019s tougher than the Greek proposal. 4) Pension reforms: tightening early retirement rules to save 1% of GDP. That\u2019s implies a more rapid overhaul than the Greek proposal. 5) Labour markets: Creditors say recent reforms would not be reversed. Greece wants to reverse them.... You can see the full list here, on To Vima. Here\u2019s the detailed list of Prior Actions Greece would have to take, too. And compared to the Greek proposal.... it\u2019s shorter, more taxing, and crosses some of Athen\u2019s famous \u2018red lines\u2019 on pensions, labour reforms and VAT. There has been a change of plan in Athens, it now emerges. Our correspondent Helena Smith says the Greek prime minister\u2019s decision to address parliament tomorrow is being seen as a direct response to calls for national unity by the main opposition leader Antonis Samaras today. Tomorrow night\u2019s parliamentary debate \u2013 the second since the radical left Syriza party assumed power \u2013 will be addressed only by party leaders. Tsipras, who has been busy conferring with core ministers in his office since his return from Brussels, is also likely to address his party on Friday morning. We will know more about the state of play \u2013 and whether the embattled leader is prepared to take on creditors \u2013 later tonight when the anti-austerity government is expected to make the order for the transfer of \u20ac300m to the IMF. Credit Agricole\u2019s Fred Ducrozet is also fairly impressed by the primary surplus targets which Greece is proposing: Yanis Varoufakis has called for Angela Merkel to come to Greece and give a \u201cSpeech of Hope\u201d: On September 6, 1946 US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes traveled to Stuttgart to deliver his historic \u201cSpeech of Hope.\u201d Byrnes\u2019 address marked America\u2019s post-war change of heart vis-\u00e0-vis Germany and gave a fallen nation a chance to imagine recovery, growth, and a return to normalcy. Seven decades later, it is my country, Greece, that needs such a chance..... And what it needs, Varoufakis says, is a dose of optimism and solidarity from the most powerful leader in Europe: What should such a declaration include? Just as Byrnes\u2019 address was short on detail but long on symbolism, a \u201cSpeech of Hope\u201d for Greece does not have to be technical. It should simply mark a sea change, a break with the past five years of adding new loans on top of already unsustainable debt, conditional on further doses of punitive austerity. More here: A Speech of Hope for Greece Some financial experts and eurocrisis commentators are quite impressed with the 47-page reform plan which Greece has drawn up (see previous post). Dan Davies, senior research advisor at Frontline Analysts, says it\u2019s much more credible than the list which Yanis Varoufakis famously sent to Brussels, including a plan to wire up tourists as secret tax inspectors: The 47-page proposal which Alexis Tsipras presented lenders with last night has now leaked, thanks to Enikos.gr. At first glance, it confirms that Greece and her creditors still disagree about primary surplus targets. But not by that much. Here\u2019s Greece\u2019s proposals: And here\u2019s the IMF/ECB/EC\u2019s targets: 2015: 1% of GDP 2016: 2% of GDP 2017: 3% of GDP 2018: 3.5% of GDP The Greek document also outlines how it would gradually raise the pension age, by progressively raising the early retirement age to 62. That would push the average retirement age up from 56.3 in 2016, to 64.4 in 2040..... Creditors are likely to favour swifter action. The long document also includes a swathe of privatisation targets, with these conditions: And there are tax changes, including a luxury tax and higher rates on planes, helicopters, speedboats and swimming pools. The document also includes a pledge to repeal recent legislation that undermined collective bargaining. New labour market rules will be brought in, that are compatible with best practice in Europe and protect workers\u2019 rights. And the minimum wage will be raised, as Syriza pledged before the election, but in a gradual way - returning to 2010 levels by the end og 2016. It also ends with a section on debt relief, explaining how Greece\u2019s creditors would agree to further restructuring and reduction. You can read the full report here. And German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel has a good take: Tsipras\u2019 Traum (Tsipras\u2019 dream) The Greek government has also slapped down a rumour on social media that Alexis Tsipras might seek a vote of confidence tomorrow, so don\u2019t get excited if you read that on Twitter...... It\u2019s official: There will be drama in the Greek parliament tomorrow afternoon -- we\u2019re hearing that Alexis Tsipras will address MPs on the crisis, from 6pm local time (4pm BST). I don\u2019t know how he\u2019ll manage to do that and also visit Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Friday, as was expected..... Greece\u2019s finance minister has denied that creditors slapped Alexis Tsipras with a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 offer -- that\u2019s not how civilised nations work, guys. Interviewed by Sky News, he also argued that Greece has most of a month to reach an agreement..... Over in Athens opposition MPs are also saying that they are hearing a cabinet meeting will take place later today so that prime minister Alexis Tsipras can \u201csound out\u201d his party. \u201cI think Tsipras is now facing his toughest choice. Is he going to take a deal or leave a deal?\u201d Anna Asimakopoulos, a shadow finance minister with the main opposition New Democracy party, has just told the Guardian. \u201cEven the deal he has put on the table is really stretching it for people in his party, while the deal lenders have put on the table is impossible for him to defend. \u201cWhat he is clearly doing now is sounding out his own people - if there is any possibility he can get the deal [proposed by creditors] through, he will stretch it out. If not, his only other option is elections.\u201d Fresh polls, she argued, would take at least 27 days to prepare for. \u201cFirst the government would have to disassemble, then constitutionally we would need another 21 days until elections are held.\u201d EC president Jean-Claude Juncker has been fielding calls from Angela Merkel, as he tries to play peacemaker between Greece and its more hard-line creditors.... Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has just weighed in, telling Reuters in Amsterdam that there are still \u201cquite large\u201d differences between the two sides. Last night\u2019s meeting, which he attended, was \u201csuccessful in narrowing down the remaining issues\u201d, Dijsselbloem added. He expects Greece to present alternative options within days. Just to clarify the point about VAT.... Lenders want the Greek government to lift the current exemptions on VAT (where the top rate is 23%). This includes, food, medicines and electricity, says Helena, for which VAT currently stands at just 6%. Reuters is also reporting that creditors are demanding VAT hikes and pension cuts. They\u2019ve also heard that the IMF/ECB/EC proposal forces Athens to continue with pension reforms, which will hit the poorest pensioners, and press on with privatisations. In return, funds totalling \u20ac10.9bn would be unlocked to tide Greece through the summer: GREECE\u2019S EU/IMF CREDITORS ASK ATHENS FOR VAT HIKES WORTH 1 PCT OF GDP, PENSION CUTS WORTH 1 PCT OF GDP - SOURCES EU/IMF DEMAND ATHENS NOT ROLL BACK PENSION REFORM OR MAKE UNILATERAL MOVES ON LABOUR ISSUES, CROSSING GREEK PM\u2019S RED LINES- SOURCES EU/IMF ASK GREECE TO SAVE 800 MLN EUROS BY SCRAPPING LOW-INCOME PENSIONERS\u2019 BENEFIT THROUGH 2016 - SOURCES EU/IMF ASK ATHENS TO COMMIT TO PRIVATISING GRID OPERATOR ADMIE, HELLENIC PETROLEUM, HELLENIKON, MAJOR PORTS, OTE, TRAINOSE -SOURCES IF DEAL IS ACCEPTED, EU/IMF PLAN AIMS TO UNLOCK 10.9 BLN EUROS FROM EFSF TO COVER GREEK NEEDS OVER JULY-AUGUST - SOURCES We are hearing that the following will be the focus of the emergency Greek cabinet meeting expected to take place later today: VAT rates being increased to 11% and 23% in bid to raise internal revenue of \u20ac1.8bn in 2015. Both would have a crippling effect on energy bills, restaurants and pharmacies. Cuts in social security system amounting to 1% of GDP this year alone which would hugely effect pensions - a red line for the leftists Primary surplus targets of: 1% in 2015; rising to 3% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018 Our correspondent Helena Smith is hearing that prime minister Alexis Tsipras is preparing to hold an \u201cemergency\u201d cabinet meeting to discuss the latest developments - possibly as early as this afternoon. Media with close ties to the governing far left Syriza are reporting that Greece is as close as it has ever come to rupture. \u201cOn the verge of rift,\u201d the government-friendly Syntakton newspaper proclaimed on its front page saying the \u201cproblematic proposal\u201d made by creditors was \u201cimpossible to sign.\u201d The well-informed portal, Newsit, argues that Greece\u2019s lenders must offer Athens some concessions: \u201cIf lenders don\u2019t make a u-turn and retreat to softer positions, rupture is at this moment appearing as the most likely scenario, even if the government will try right up until the end to secure a \u2018mutually beneficial solution,\u2019\u201d Newsit adds: \u201cThe prime minister and his close associates are returning to Athens with their luggage much heavier because of the lenders\u2019 proposal, and with all scenarios on a political level now open.\u201d Elections, it is said, could take place on the last Sunday of June (28th) or the first Sunday of July. A meeting of political party leaders might also be called in the coming days. Over in Athens news of the measures now being demanded by creditors has been received with the force of a lead balloon, with government MPs and the opposition leader voicing deep concerns. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: It is not only the government that has reacted with thinly veiled-violence to the five-page draft agreement revealed by European president jean Claude Juncker last night. The former prime minister Antonis Samaras, whose \u2018pro-bailout\u2019 centre right New Democracy party was ousted from power in January, has also called the proposed plan a disaster, describing the measures put forward by lenders as far more onerous than any his own government had been asked to apply. Reacting to the latest twist in Greece\u2019s stand-off with creditors, the main opposition leader derided the anti-austerity coalition\u2019s negotiating tactics. \u201cThe proposed measures, as government ministers themselves accept, are much harsher than the measures of Hardouvelis,\u201d Samaras said referring to his own former finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis. \u201cThe total cost [of Greece under Tsipras] is quite clearly huge, not only in VAT, electricity, the private domaine, etc but primarily in credibility. The deceit and lies are over.\u201d Several leading Syriza cadres today suggested that the only way out would be through fresh elections - or putting the deal to public vote via a referendum. Describing the lenders\u2019 draft agreement as \u201cmost brazen and provocative,\u201d the deputy social security minister, Dimitris Stratoulis, insisted this morning that though debt-stricken and insolvent, Greece still had \u201calternatives solutions.\u201d Stratoulis argued: \u201cIf they don\u2019t back down, the country won\u2019t be lost, it has alternatives solutions and democratic ways out that the people could have a place in ... there are alternatives that would cost less that our signing a disgraceful and dishonourable agreement.\u201d But Samaras said fresh elections would be catastrophic for the crisis-plagued country. He said: \u201cThis nonsense about elections has to end because elections today would happen under very harsh and unfavourable conditions for Greeks. Let alone that they would bring us to an even worse point than the one we find ourselves in today. And anyway what would Syriza be looking for, to get a mandate from the people to take us to the drachma? Unless that, from the start, was their real aim.\u201d The former prime minister, whose party is lagging far behind Syriza in the polls, reiterrated that national consensus was the only way forward for a nation that has repeatedly said it does not want to exit the euro. Samaras concluded: \u201cThe only way out that has remained for Mr Tsipras is to settle on the big national agreement that we have suggested. It is the only road for the country,\u201d To no-one\u2019s surprise, the Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. That means borrowing costs have been unchanged since March 2009, before the eurozone crisis even began. Over in Greece, government MPs are feeling bruised after seeing Tsipras effectively given an ultimatum by creditors in Brussels. Paul Mason of Channel 4 News reports: They came, they saw, they had \u2013 as one Syriza MP put it to me last night \u2013 \u201ctheir balls handed to them\u201d. Mason argues that the creditor\u2019s offer isn\u2019t \u201call bad\u201d. A 1 per cent budget surplus target for this year, in a shrinking economy, looks optimistic \u2013 but it is lower than the 3-4 per cent the previous government had been asked for. A two-tier VAT rise will raise money from the poorest off; but VAT has to rise in a country like Greece where assets are held offshore, and where getting businesses to pay corporation tax is a strategic problem, and does not balance the books short term. The hardest details for Greece came when its lenders demanded pension payments to be cut by 1 per cent of GDP. However the deal on offer is reported to say that if Greece does not want to hit pensioners it must hit somebody else, to the same extent. But the big problem is that it doesn\u2019t include any pledges of debt relief, which makes it very hard to persuade Syriza MPs to support it.... The full piece is worth a read: Greece debt crisis: the unsustainable ultimatum Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, is hearing that the IMF has let it be known that it \u201cdoes not mind\u201d if Greece effectively misses its \u20ac305m debt repayment deadline tomorrow and \u201cbundles up\u201d loan instalments for the end of the month. That of course when its current bailout programme ends. The Financial Times has also confirmed that a new meeting between Greece and her creditors will take place tomorrow, after yesterday\u2019s gathering made only limited progress. Peter Spiegel writes: EU leaders have long hoped Mr Tsipras would personally take over negotiations after months of little progress with mid-level officials from the Greek finance ministry. People briefed on the talks expressed optimism that an outline of a deal could still be reached by the end of the week. \u201cTsipras wants to wrap it up himself,\u201d said one senior official. The European Commission is briefing reporters in Brussels now. Spokesman Margaritis Schinas says that last night\u2019s meeting between Tsipras and Juncker was constructive, and confirms they will meet again soon. However, he won\u2019t confirm that they\u2019re meeting tomorrow: Greek insiders have told us that Juncker and Tsipras will indeed meet tomorrow, as Kathimerini reported earlier. We\u2019re seeing more quotes from Yanis Varoufakis on the Reuters terminal: GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS SAYS THERE IS NO REASON WHATSOEVER TO HOLD SNAP ELECTIONS GREEK FINANCE MINISTER, ASKED ABOUT JUNE 5 IMF PAYMENT, SAYS GREEK STATE ALWAYS AIMS AT REPAYING ITS OBLIGATIONS GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS SAYS FIRMLY OPPOSED TO ELECTRICITY UTILITY PPC\u2019S PRIVATISATION Last night, Alexis Tsipras told reporters in Brussels not to worry about tomorrow\u2019s \u20ac305m payment due to the IMF, arguing that Greece had handled bigger payments in the past. And this tweet may explain his confidence: Amid the uncertainty, Greece\u2019s unemployment crisis remains a bleeding wound. The jobless rate was unchanged at 25.6% in March, according to new figures from Elstat. Elstat reports that the number of Greeks in work actually fell by 16,092 persons compared with February 2015. The unemployment total also fell, by 4,283. How can that be? Because 16,751 persons declared themselves inactive - dropping out of the labour market forever. There are now 3,518,858 people employed in Greece, 1,211,507 unemployed, and 3,368,392 classed as inactive. Finance minister Yanous Varoufakis has told reporters that the Greek government is aiming for a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d deal by the end of the month, and also resisting pressure to raise sales tax rates. The next few days are absolutely essential, Pierre Moscovici adds, if Greece and creditors are to agree a cash-for-reforms deal in time: EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS NEXT HOURS, DAYS ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IN GREEK TALKS, \u201cI AM OPTIMISTIC, BUT THERE IS STILL A WAY TO GO\u201d EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici remains convinced that a Greek agreement will be reached in time. Speaking in Brussels this morning, Moscovici says: \u201cMy deep conviction is that we will find a deal on Greece.\u201d Discussions are fruitful, he says, and good progress is being made. There are some wild moves in the financial markets this morning, and Greece is only partly to blame. Eurozone bond prices are falling across the board. That follows yesterday\u2019s ECB press conference, where Mario Draghi predicted that volatility was here to stay. That has prompted traders to pile out of bonds, pushing prices down and driving up yields (the interest rate paid to bondholders). German 10-year bonds are now yielding 0.98% -- a sharp jump. That\u2019s highest since last September, meaning any trader who piled into Bunds this year is sitting on a loss. After an early fall, the euro has now jumped to $1.134. That\u2019s weighing on European stocks, pushing down the German, French, Spanish and Italian markets. The UK is dropping too: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spread EX, says Greek developments will push the markets around today: The Greek PM, for now, is holding firm to the idea that any deal must be based on a proposal coming from, not going to, Greece, with a counter offer from the country expected to land at creditors\u2019 feet at some point before the end of the week. Reports that Tsipras and Juncker will meet again on Friday means things will be left incredibly close to, and maybe actually beyond, the IMF repayment wire [on Friday]. Yet one questions if any change in attitude, be it from either side, can occur in such a small space of time; if a deal couldn\u2019t be found on Wednesday, a shift in tone by Friday seems unlikely. Nevertheless, the Eurozone indices are continuing their rollercoaster ride this week, slipping to losses after seeing hope-filled gains yesterday afternoon. Lots of chatter about Greece this morning: Greece\u2019s stock market fell sharply at the start of trading in Athens, pushing the ATG index down over 3%. Yesterday it jumped 4%, on hopes of a breakthrough in Brussels. Hugo Dixon, Editor-at-Large at Reuters News, reckons there are four ways this crisis will play out: It\u2019s all go this morning! Dow Jones newswires is reporting that the Athens government is planning to make a new counter-offer, having \u2018converged\u2019 with its creditors on some issues last night. That may explain why Alexis Tsipras will meet with Juncker on Friday. That convergence probably applies to the primary surplus targets (creditors are offering less onerous surpluses, starting at 1% this year, rising to 2%, then 3%, then 3.5% in 2017) Greek jitters are hitting the euro this morning too, flags up Ipek Ozkardeskaya, market analyst at London Capital Group. The single currency has dropped by 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.1232, from $1.1274 (a two-week high). Here\u2019s the official line from Alexis Tsipras this morning for English readers: European stock markets have fallen at the start of trading, as traders react to last night\u2019s inconclusive Greek meeting. In London, the FTSE 100 swiftly shed 56 points to 6894, down 0.8%, with almost every share in the red: Every blue-chip share on France\u2019s CAC index is down, too: Greece\u2019s Kathimerini newspaper is reporting that Alexis Tsipras will meet Jean-Claude Juncker again on Friday, in another attempt to break the deadlock. Greece\u2019s Deputy Shipping Minister has warned this morning that the government will not \u2018surrender\u2019 to its creditors. Thodoris Dritsas told Greek TV that: \u201cWhat appears to have been discussed and to have been proposed by Mr. Juncker during his meeting with the Greek prime minister is beneath (our) expectations in every way.\u201d \u201cIf reports are confirmed, obviously we cannot accept them.\u201d Good morning. Greece\u2019s future remains as confused as ever, after Wednesday night\u2019s crunch meeting in Brussels between prime minister Alexis Tsipras and EC president Jean-Claude Juncker broke up without a deal. After speaking for more than four hours, Tsipras emerged after midnight to announce that Greece couldn\u2019t accept some of the proposals put together by its creditors. Instead, he argued, any deal to unlock bailout funds must be based on his own side\u2019s offer. As he put it: \u201cThe realistic proposals on the table are the proposals of the Greek government.\u201d And Tsipras has just tweeted that discussions will continue.... The meeting wasn\u2019t a disaster - according to Tsipras, the two sides are \u201cvery close\u201d to agreeing new fiscal targets, after the creditors proposed lower primary surplus goals. But there appears to be less consensus on pension reforms and VAT reform, with Greece refusing to roll over and accept a five-page list of proposals created by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission. If you missed the action, it\u2019s all in Wednesday\u2019s liveblog: What happens now? According to the EC, both sides will hold more \u201cintense work\u201d in an attempt to reach a joint position soon. It said: It was a good constructive meeting. Progress was made in understanding each other\u2019s positions on the basis of various proposals. It was agreed they will meet again. Intense work will continue. But the failure to make a breakthrough last night is still disappointing, with a \u20ac305m payment to the IMF due tomorrow, and just 26 days until Greece\u2019s bailout programme expires. I\u2019ll be tracking all the action and reaction through the day, along with other events across the world economy and the financial markets. That will include the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision at noon UK time (we\u2019re braced for a dramatic \u2018no change)....",

      "bodyText": "The sale of the last 30% of Royal Mail \u201cwill be designed to deliver best value for money to the taxpayer\u201d, says the Treasury. Let\u2019s hope so because it would make a pleasant change. Last time, at privatisation in 2013, the state sold at 330p, which turned out to be a gross undervaluation. The stock immediately shot above 400p and has spent barely a day below that level. It has been as high as 600p and has now settled around 500p. This time there can be no excuses. Royal Mail is now a FTSE 100 company and the market in its shares is deep and active, making it easier to define value for money: it means shedding the stock as close to the market price as possible. In practice, that probably means selling slowly but steadily. The current \u201ctrading plan\u201d in operation at Lloyds Banking Group shows the way. A drip-feed of shares is proving very effective. The state\u2019s stake has been quietly reduced from 25% to 19% in less than four months. The government, then, should forget any fancy idea about launching a second retail offer at Royal Mail. In government hands, a retail offer always means discounts or loyalty bonuses, which are a straightforward cost to the public purse. Chancellor George Osborne, nonsensically given current success, is committed to a retail offer for some portion of the Lloyds rump. At Royal Mail, he should cast aside any airy notions of promoting \u201cthe shareholder society\u201d via the use of discounts. Keep it simple. If we must relinquish our last Royal Mail shares (currently sporting a not-bad dividend yield of 4%), let it be done at the highest possible price, thus benefitting all taxpayers equally. Lloyds record PPI fine a knock to Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s credibility The sale of Lloyds shares won\u2019t be seriously affected by the imminent \u00a3100m fine for mishandling payment protection insurance (PPI) claims. But, for the credibility of Lloyds\u2019 chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, and his management, a record fine from the Financial Conduct Authority is a serious knock. Horta-Os\u00f3rio likes to promote Lloyds as a bank that does \u201cthe right thing\u201d by its customers. To be fair to him, on arrival at Lloyds in 2011, he broke ranks with the banking industry by conceding that PPI had been mis-sold to hundreds of thousands of customers. But doing the right thing also means handling claims fairly, even if half those claims are fuelled by devious legal locusts. Horta-Os\u00f3rio can\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t warned. In 2013, the FCA fined Lloyds \u00a34.3m for delays in making compensation payments to up to 140,000 customers. That was firmly on his watch, not the old regime\u2019s. Lloyds took the affair so seriously that it withheld bonus awards from senior management from 2012 and 2013 until the current investigation was completed. The bank\u2019s pay report suggests that Horta-Os\u00f3rio has \u00a34m-worth of shares at risk. We await the details of the FCA\u2019s findings but a \u00a3100m fine suggests the failings are very serious. If the boss is to see any of that \u00a34m, the Lloyds chairman, Lord Blackwell, will have to provide a very good explanation. Morrisons should take shareholder rebellion to heart A 35.6% vote against a company\u2019s pay report counts as a big rebellion, even these days. It might have been higher if Dalton Philips, recipient of a \u00a31m bonus, was still chief executive. New chairman Andrew Higginson can argue all he likes that the company did well to hit targets on profits, cash generation and dividends. But, come on, last year was not a good year for Morrisons: the mechanics of the incentive scheme are flawed if they can still produce such a sum in those circumstances. Higginson promised a review of incentives and contracts, but didn\u2019t sound thrilled by the prospect. \u201cKnowing what to change may be difficult,\u201d he said. Summon some enthusiasm: a 35% vote against is not good. Sports Direct appoint will do little to allay fears about Ashley power You labour for 18 months to find a finance director and then you appoint the internal financial controller on an \u201cacting\u201d basis. It can only be Sports Direct. Matt Pearson is the chap who has, in effect, got the job on probation. Few financial specialists get the chance to join the board of a FTSE 100 company at 35, so you can\u2019t blame Pearson for deciding to overlook the less-than-wholehearted endorsement from the board. But this appointment will do little to address outside shareholders\u2019 worry that Mike Ashley, 55% shareholder and owner, has too much power. Sports Direct would benefit from the scrutiny of an outsider in a key role \u2013 still.",

In the days leading up to the world\u2019s largest private employer\u2019s annual shareholders meeting, workers and their representatives have gathered to hear the company\u2019s plans. In addition to complaints of low pay, not enough hours and lack of flexible schedules, workers have raised issues such as the company-mandated dress code and the music played in the stores nationwide. One of the presentations featured a puppet named Willie, who jokes that being a Walmart worker was dangerous because \u201cone of [his] fellow associated recently developed a serious eye tic from hearing Celine Dion\u2019s greatest hits on loop in our stores\u201d. As a result, Walmart decided to say goodbye to CDs featuring the Titanic singer and Justin Bieber, who was also mentioned as an irritant. Instead, workers in Walmart stores and distributions centers will now get to listen to Walmart Radio, which promises a more varied song list. Among other changes Walmart is adding denim to its khaki or black denim dress code.

Greece is expected to make a \u20ac305m payment to the International Monetary Fund on Friday, but time is tight for an agreement before the cash runs out.</p> <p>Rising bond yields, in Germany in particular, continue to unsettle investors, with the movement partly attributed to comments from ECB president Mario Draghi suggesting it would not interfere even if bond market volatility continued.</p> <p>European markets were a sea of red, although off their worst levels as a surge in the euro prompted some profit taking. There was also some nervousness ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers. The IMF seemed to go against the Federal Reserve\u2019s view by saying that the central bank should not raise interest rates until early 2016. The Fed has maintained that recent disappointing economic data may well be due to temporary factors - such as poor weather - and that a rate rise before the end of the year could be on the cards. Caught up in the global declines, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 120 points by the time London closed.</p> <p>With all that, a broad based sell-off saw the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finish down 91.22 points or 1.31% to 6859.24, its lowest level since 2 April.</p> <p>The biggest loser in the leading index was <strong>Johnson Matthey</strong>, down 185p at \u00a333.31 as the specialist chemicals group\u2019s results disappointed investors, who were concerned about rising debt levels and weaker precious metals prices.</p> <p>Miners were under pressure on worries about China, a key consumer of commodities. David Madden, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The falls follow] news that one Chinese broker is cutting back on margin trading, and this signals the strain the second-largest economy in the world is under. China\u2019s economy is too dependent on credit and it feels like the pressure cooker is about to blow.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>BHP Billiton</strong> lost 43.5p to 1323.5p as Goldman Sachs cut its price target from \u00a314 to \u00a312.75 with a neutral rating, while <strong>Anglo American</strong> fell 43p to \u00a310.05.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile PwC\u2019s annual survey of the sector said mining companies had cut costs to cope with falling prices, while their stock market values dropped to a 10 yaer low. But PwC said demand for copper and other metails was likel to rise over the longer term as Chinas economy grew. \u201cWe believe that he reforms being undertaken will place China in a good position to continue to grow oer the long term, albeit at a slower pace,\u201d it said.</p> <p>A number of companies saw their shares go ex-dividend including <strong>National Grid</strong>, down 46.5p at 869p, and <strong>WPP</strong>, 54p lower at \u00a315.05.</p> <p><strong>Royal Mail</strong> fell 26p to 500p as the UK government confirmed plans to start selling its remaining 30% stake in the postal group</p> <p>But B&amp;Q owner <strong>Kingfisher</strong> climbed 9.8p to 3779.9p after Bank of America Merrill Lynch moved from underperform to neutral and raised its target price from 330p to 390p.</p> <p>And <strong>easyJet</strong> rose 10p to \u00a315.92 as the budget airline announced a 7.2% rise in passenger numbers in May.</p> <p><strong>Dairy Crest</strong> added 16p to 543p after Investec moved from hold to buy on the basis that its dairy sale would go ahead, perhaps leaving it as a takeover target. Analyst Nicola Mallard said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dairy Crest sounds confident that its dairy sale to Muller will be cleared by the Competitions and Markets Authority, which will pave the way to it becoming a largely branded, UK food company. We feel there is some upside potential in the stock price if all goes to plan, without assuming any bid speculation, which could arise once the group sheds what has been a very effective \u201cpoison pill\u201d. We move to a buy with a new target price of 554p.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ladbrokes</strong> was lifted 3.2p to 125.5p on bid speculation and news that Peel Hunt had moved from hold to buy ahead of a strategy review by new chief executive Jim Mullen.<br></p> <p>But <strong>Tullow Oil</strong> slipped 14.7p to 381p after a sell note from Cantor Fitzgerald. Analyst Sam Wahab said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last 12 months have been challenging for the oil and gas sector and in particular for Tullow. In order to withstand the current subdued macro environment, the company has increased and diversified its sources of debt capital, reduced its exploration expenditure, implemented significant cost saving initiatives, and suspended its dividend. We believe however that an overreliance on debt to fund risky ventures could prove costly. We initiate coverage with a sell recommendation and target price of 342p.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market<strong> Scicys </strong>slumped 24.5p to 58p after the IT group issued a profit warning and said it may breach certain banking covenants when these are tested in August. But it added its bank was supportive at this time.<br></p> <p>The profit warning followed problems at a major fixed price development contract, where the size and complexity had been underestimated and provisions would need to be made for the addition cost to complete it.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares fell to a two month low as the brinkmanship over Greece continued despite another round of late night meetings. With clear differences between the proposals put forward by the Greek government and the country\u2019s creditors, the prospect of an imminent deal is looking slim. Greece is expected to make a \u20ac305m payment to the International Monetary Fund on Friday, but time is tight for an agreement before the cash runs out. Rising bond yields, in Germany in particular, continue to unsettle investors, with the movement partly attributed to comments from ECB president Mario Draghi suggesting it would not interfere even if bond market volatility continued. European markets were a sea of red, although off their worst levels as a surge in the euro prompted some profit taking. There was also some nervousness ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers. The IMF seemed to go against the Federal Reserve\u2019s view by saying that the central bank should not raise interest rates until early 2016. The Fed has maintained that recent disappointing economic data may well be due to temporary factors - such as poor weather - and that a rate rise before the end of the year could be on the cards. Caught up in the global declines, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 120 points by the time London closed. With all that, a broad based sell-off saw the FTSE 100 finish down 91.22 points or 1.31% to 6859.24, its lowest level since 2 April. The biggest loser in the leading index was Johnson Matthey, down 185p at \u00a333.31 as the specialist chemicals group\u2019s results disappointed investors, who were concerned about rising debt levels and weaker precious metals prices. Miners were under pressure on worries about China, a key consumer of commodities. David Madden, market analyst at IG, said: [The falls follow] news that one Chinese broker is cutting back on margin trading, and this signals the strain the second-largest economy in the world is under. China\u2019s economy is too dependent on credit and it feels like the pressure cooker is about to blow. BHP Billiton lost 43.5p to 1323.5p as Goldman Sachs cut its price target from \u00a314 to \u00a312.75 with a neutral rating, while Anglo American fell 43p to \u00a310.05. Meanwhile PwC\u2019s annual survey of the sector said mining companies had cut costs to cope with falling prices, while their stock market values dropped to a 10 yaer low. But PwC said demand for copper and other metails was likel to rise over the longer term as Chinas economy grew. \u201cWe believe that he reforms being undertaken will place China in a good position to continue to grow oer the long term, albeit at a slower pace,\u201d it said. A number of companies saw their shares go ex-dividend including National Grid, down 46.5p at 869p, and WPP, 54p lower at \u00a315.05. Royal Mail fell 26p to 500p as the UK government confirmed plans to start selling its remaining 30% stake in the postal group But B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher climbed 9.8p to 3779.9p after Bank of America Merrill Lynch moved from underperform to neutral and raised its target price from 330p to 390p. And easyJet rose 10p to \u00a315.92 as the budget airline announced a 7.2% rise in passenger numbers in May. Dairy Crest added 16p to 543p after Investec moved from hold to buy on the basis that its dairy sale would go ahead, perhaps leaving it as a takeover target. Analyst Nicola Mallard said: Dairy Crest sounds confident that its dairy sale to Muller will be cleared by the Competitions and Markets Authority, which will pave the way to it becoming a largely branded, UK food company. We feel there is some upside potential in the stock price if all goes to plan, without assuming any bid speculation, which could arise once the group sheds what has been a very effective \u201cpoison pill\u201d. We move to a buy with a new target price of 554p. Ladbrokes was lifted 3.2p to 125.5p on bid speculation and news that Peel Hunt had moved from hold to buy ahead of a strategy review by new chief executive Jim Mullen. But Tullow Oil slipped 14.7p to 381p after a sell note from Cantor Fitzgerald. Analyst Sam Wahab said: The last 12 months have been challenging for the oil and gas sector and in particular for Tullow. In order to withstand the current subdued macro environment, the company has increased and diversified its sources of debt capital, reduced its exploration expenditure, implemented significant cost saving initiatives, and suspended its dividend. We believe however that an overreliance on debt to fund risky ventures could prove costly. We initiate coverage with a sell recommendation and target price of 342p. Lower down the market Scicys slumped 24.5p to 58p after the IT group issued a profit warning and said it may breach certain banking covenants when these are tested in August. But it added its bank was supportive at this time. The profit warning followed problems at a major fixed price development contract, where the size and complexity had been underestimated and provisions would need to be made for the addition cost to complete it. On top of that the strength of the pound against the euro has also hit its figures. In all this means a \u201csubstantial shortfall in profits compared to the guidance issued in March.\u201d Analysts at finnCap said: Following a detailed and aggressive review, the senior management team has decided to take a major provision against a fixed price contract in the enterprise solutions and defence division, which appears to have been substantially underestimated. This provision, together with the forex impact of continuing sterling strength, is likely to virtually eliminate the expected profit this year. We therefore reduce our 2015 forecast adjusted pretax profit from \u00a33.3m to \u00a30.3m. There is likely to be a spill over into 2016 as staff are reallocated to complete the contract \u2013 set for delivery in February \u2013 and we reduce next year\u2019s pretax profit forecast from \u00a33.8m to \u00a32.4m. Cash balances will be low and the company risks breaching banking covenants; however, the banks remain supportive and Scicys is underpinned by a strong balance sheet with \u00a39m of property, including a \u00a35m headquarters near Chippenham. We anticipate the dividend strategy will be unchanged. Overall, this is disappointing but it is a ring-fenced one-off issue and procedures have been amended to ensure no recurrence.",

      "bodyText": "The last time the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) met, it wanted to send a message to oil producers that weren\u2019t cartel members: cut it out. The members of the world\u2019s most powerful energy club are likely to allow themselves a congratulatory smile when they meet again on Friday. The message was received. At Friday\u2019s meeting in Vienna, Opec is widely expected to keep its production quota at 30m barrels a day, a level set when Opec last met in November. At the time, crude-oil analysts said the cartel was launching a price war for global market share with non-Opec members, namely US shale-oil producers. Opec\u2019s move worked but the competition is still snapping at its heels. Crude-oil prices tumbled after November\u2019s meeting, with values for the global benchmark, Brent, falling to about $50 a barrel in January from a high of about $115 in June 2014. The US standard, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), fell to about $45 in January, from a high of about $106 in June 2014. Fast-forward to June and it seems Opec got what it wanted. US production growth is slowing as the number of crude-oil rigs has fallen, and Opec managed to incrementally increase its market share to 33% as of April, from 32% in mid-2014, according to a research note from Barclays. Crude-oil prices are also higher since early 2015, around $65 a barrel for Brent and $61 for US WTI, on a combination of a slowdown in US oil production growth and a US dollar that has tempered its own strength. Because crude oil is denominated in dollars, a stronger buck can weigh on values. But that doesn\u2019t mean Opec is back to solely determining the direction of the oil market, crude-oil analysts said. \u201cThey want to keep the price low enough to keep US shale-oil producers from producing,\u201d said Charles Nedoss, senior market strategist at LaSalle Futures Group. \u201cThey\u2019re dealing with something they\u2019ve never dealt with before, the fact that someone else can step-up production.\u201d The US oil boom means Opec is under pressure to retain its production quota if it wants to build market share and keep US producers reined in. Michael Loewen, commodity strategist at TD Securities, said Opec members will likely say they are justified in standing pat because demand is picking up, which is what Opec has said for the past few months. Loewen said internal demand in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states is higher, and the summer driving season in the US is under way, normally a time of higher use. Although US gasoline prices are above where they were a few months ago because of higher oil prices, with a national average price of $2.75 a gallon, they\u2019re still nearly a $1 a gallon cheaper than a year ago, according to AAA. Still, slightly greater demand is not going to eat into the slush pile of crude oil. Global supplies continued to exceed global demand by more than 1.5m barrels per day in the second quarter, Barclays said. Some of the excess comes from Opec members producing about 1.3m to 1.5m barrels a day above their production quota, Loewen said. If Opec sits tight, crude oil prices will stay around where they are, Nedoss said; if it announces a cut to the quota, then oil prices could spike higher. Any significant price rise would be temporary because it could signal to US producers to go back to pumping more oil, he added. The odds of an Opec quota production cut is \u201ctremendously low\u201d, Loewen said Tim Porter, energy analyst and portfolio manager at Reaves Asset Management, said US producers need $75 a barrel to expand production. Some companies still drilled oil wells even as prices fell, but they did not put the wells into production. \u201cThose would be easy to tap,\u201d he said, if prices rebounded on an announced Opec production cut. US shale-oil production growth has slowed, but an outright decline has not shown up in data yet, Porter said. As of the end of March, the US Department of Energy said the US produced 9.5m barrels of oil per day in 2015 versus 8.25m barrels daily in March 2014. \u201cWe really haven\u2019t see the drop in the US production and probably won\u2019t until the end of the year,\u201d he said. There\u2019s a small chance Opec could raise the quota to match what the cartel is actually producing, Loewen said. If that\u2019s the case, Nedoss said oil prices would fall, but probably closer to $55 a barrel for WTI, rather than going back to the lows set in January. \u201cIf they hike the quota, prices will fall, but that will just encourage demand so prices won\u2019t stay low,\u201d he said. \u201cI see prices holding between $55 and $65 a barrel (for WTI) for a while because Opec can\u2019t do anything. What else can they do? They have one hand tied behind their back because of US producers.\u201d",

The pharmaceutical industry could recover after a few years of declining manufacturing output. Or maybe the energy industry will bounce back from its oil-price induced slump. Without another large-scale industry firing on all cylinders, GDP figures could remain lacklustre \u2022 This blog has been corrected. Original figures supplied by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders suggested that sales rose from 146,820 to 194,032 between April and May last year \u2013 a rise of 31%. The SMMT later said this was a mistake, correcting the April figure to 176,820.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is facing a \u00a3100m fine for mishandling compensation payouts for mis-sold payment protection insurance, in a move that is likely to lead to a clamour for its top management team to have their bonuses withheld. The penalty, which could be announced as soon as Friday, will come as the government prepares to offer private investors shares in the bailed-out bank \u2013 and after its boss, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, received a \u00a311.5m pay deal in 2014. In anticipation of the punishment by industry regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, the bank has frozen the release of shares from bonuses that had been deferred from 2012 and 2013. An estimated \u00a315m for about a dozen executives is thought to be outstanding although it is not clear what proportion has frozen. Horta-Os\u00f3rio has shares worth more than \u00a34m that have yet to be released while other key members of the bank\u2019s management, including its finance director, George Culmer, and outgoing head of retail banking, Alison Brittain, have also had share awards postponed. It is not clear whether all or part of the shares which have been frozen will be withheld permanently.

In 2013, the FCA fined Lloyds \u00a34.3m for delays in making compensation payments to up to 140,000 customers. Lloyds has already set aside more than any other bank to tackle PPI compensation \u2013 \u00a312bn since 2011 when Horta-Os\u00f3rio stunned the City by breaking away from the industry and starting to pay out compensation. Until then banks had been involved in a legal tussle with the regulators over PPI, which was once a major source of profits for banks.

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has promoted an insider to be acting finance officer in an attempt to quell shareholder complaints that its billionaire founder Mike Ashley has too much power. The UK\u2019s largest sporting goods retailer said Matt Pearson had been appointed acting chief financial officer with immediate effect. Pearson joined Sports Direct in 2007 as group financial controller, having previously worked at Ernst &amp; Young. The FTSE 100 retailer has been criticised for its opaque corporate governance and repeated attempts to create lavish bonus schemes for Ashley, who owns 55% of the company and is executive deputy chairman. Concerns about Ashley\u2019s power have deepened in the 18 months the company has been without a CFO: Bob Mellors stood down on health grounds in late 2013. One of Sports Direct\u2019s biggest shareholders, Crispin Odey, who controls 5% of the company through his hedge fund Odey Asset Management, has complained there is no one to question Ashley\u2019s decisions. He told the Sunday Telegraph in February that the absence of a CFO \u201cputs too much power into one person\u2019s hands\u201d. In the past 18 months, Ashley has put Sports Direct\u2019s money on high-stakes gambles in Tesco and Debenhams stock. The company has also tried and failed to award Ashley a massive bonus.

      "bodyText": "Having money from economic growth flow to poor people rather than the rich feeds into a lift in the rate of economic growth and lower unemployment. Conversely, as income inequality increases, the potential for economic growth is constrained. The economic case for maintaining a progressive income tax structure and targeting welfare payments to those most in need is overwhelming. The issue can be illustrated through a simple stylised example which outlines how a higher cash flow to the poorest is growth enhancing while a higher cash flow to the rich boosts savings, but keeps economic growth lower. Take a situation where there is a $1bn addition to the economy via growth. That $1bn can be distributed in many different ways but let\u2019s initially assume the 10 richest people in Australia each receive all of that gain, with $100m going to each person. According to the BRW Rich list, the tenth richest person in Australia has wealth of $2.65bn while the richest, Gina Rinehart, has more than $14bn. Economic theory and research suggests that the extra $100m to each of these uber wealthy people would be almost totally be absorbed into their wealth and there would be only a very small increase in economic activity as a result. According to research from the Brookings Institution and the Reserve Bank of Australia, the marginal propensity to consume of high-income earners is substantially less than for low-income earners. In other words, poorer people are likely to spend the bulk of any extra income while the wealthy are more likely to save it. Looked at another way, would Gina Rinehart, Anthony Pratt or Harry Triguboff increase their spending over and above their current consumption patterns if their income had a one off boost of $100m? The answer is an overwhelming no. More likely the extra $100m would merely find its way into their assets and wealth. Any impact on the macro-economy as a result would be small. An alternative is distributing the $1bn by allocating $1,000 to each of the poorest one million people via a $20 a week tax cut or benefit increase. In this scenario, there is a strong probability the vast bulk of the $1bn would be spent to improve their living standards. Low-income earners are unlikely to save or invest the extra income. Now think of how the different distribution of the $1bn will affect the economy and jobs. If the money finds its way to those on low incomes, there will inevitably be higher aggregate spending, more jobs and quite simply a stronger economy. And if the income distribution continues to be skewed to those on low incomes, there will be a lift in the growth potential of the economy. Unemployment would be structurally lower and there would be a self-supporting cycle of stronger activity as a result. In most sober analyses of income distribution, no one is suggesting governments have a policy framework to crunch the rich and blindly give the money to the poor. Rather, the idea of greater income equality and a more even distribution of wealth reiterates the importance of a progressive income tax structure. It also highlights the economically sensible nature of targeted welfare assistance to those on lower incomes and a tightening of payments away from high income earners. This is where the current tax breaks to very wealthy Australian superannuants and the business sector need to be radically overhauled. Not only will changing policies in these areas enhance economic growth and see a structural lowering in the unemployment rate, they have the other benefit of being fair, decent and compassionate. Let\u2019s hope the next election covers the issues of income inequality and how redistribution is such a vital element for growth.

    "webTitle": "Greek leader meets eurozone creditors \u2013 but as expected, no deal yet", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s radical prime minister, met with his eurozone creditors in Brussels on Wednesday evening over the terms of his country remaining in the single currency, as the five-year crisis centred on debt and democracy moved towards a climax. Tsipras joined the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, for dinner and a battle of wills over conflicting ideas for resolving Greece\u2019s financial catastrophe, although many believe the best they are likely to agree is a fix to buy more time. Although the meeting went well, it ended without a deal. However, there were positive expressions from participants afterwards and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, said that there was more to come. \u201cWe will continue our talks in a few days,\u201d Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, told reporters after emerging in the early hours of Thursday morning from the meeting. Tsipras had gone to argue for acceptance of a 47-page reform programme he handed his creditors this week. Juncker was charged with presenting him with a quite different blueprint, drafted following an emergency summit of national and international leaders in Berlin on Monday. Tsipras maintained after the meeting that the Greek proposal was the only realistic option. He said that Athens still rejected some of the creditors\u2019 proposals but indicated that a deal was close on some of the issues and that Athens would make a payment due to the IMF on Friday. The European commission said: \u201cIt was a good constructive meeting. Progress was made in understanding each other\u2019s positions on the basis of various proposals. It was agreed they will meet again. Intense work will continue.\u201d Before the meeting, Tsipras had been confident that Europe\u2019s leadership would \u201csee reason\u201d. \u201cIt is more essential than ever for the institutions and the political leadership of Europe to accede to the realism with which the [Greek] government has been moving for the past three months. We have to avoid division,\u201d he said. But the commission had earlier played down expectations of any quick breakthrough. \u201cNo final outcome expected,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Juncker. In a week of hastily called summits, emergency drafting of positions and demands, and a cacophony of voices from the leading players saying utterly different things, it is not clear whether Tsipras will be able to clinch a deal with his European and International Monetary Fund creditors. The high-stakes negotiations could collapse through intransigence on both sides or, perhaps more likely, result in a time-buying pact that would resolve little of substance. It would, however, pull Greece back from the brink of insolvency, default and possible ejection from the eurozone. Following a mini-summit on Monday of German, French, IMF and European Central Bank (ECB) leaders in Berlin, the creditors tabled a stiff set of demands that Greece would need to meet to secure the \u20ac7.2bn remaining in bailout funds for now. Pessimistic that Greece can meet the terms or put its soaring sovereign debt trajectory on a sustainable path, the IMF has been pressing the Europeans to discreetly countenance a restructuring or writedown of Greek debt. It appeared that effort had failed, for now, leaving Tsipras with extremely tough choices \u2013 accept the stiff austerity terms and face a different confrontation with rejectionist hardliners in his far-left Syriza movement at home or reject the terms and call Europe\u2019s bluff over allowing a country to fall out of the single currency. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and the Spanish finance minister, Luis de Guindos, said they were confident an agreement would be reached, if not on Wednesday then before Friday, when Greece is due to repay \u20ac300m to the IMF, the first of four payments this month. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4euble, and Dijsselbloem voiced pessimism that a deal would be struck. Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, said the priority need was for a strong agreement, criticising what he sees as feeble proposals from the Tsipras government since it came to power in January on a ticket to reverse eurozone-dictated austerity and recast the bailout terms. Draghi said he would not relax the ECB ceilings allowing Greek banks to provide a lifeline by lending the government money unless the creditors are able to start disbursing the remaining loans, meaning no more mercy from the ECB unless Tsipras accepted the eurozone\u2019s terms. Both sides appear desperate for a deal but appear unable to make the concessions needed to facilitate the agreement as they have quite different aims and cannot agree on the end, nor in the means to that end. Tsipras has been calling on the eurozone to respect the anti-austerity mandate he received from the Greek electorate. Sch\u00e4euble and Marc Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, accused him of making promises that he could not keep to get himself elected. The current bailout expires at the end of the month. It will need to be followed by further negotiations on a third rescue package for Greece. Tsipras has been trying for months to roll both packages into one. The Germans and most others insist the terms of the current bailout must be met before a followup deal can be contemplated. Crucial to the financial arithmetic is the dispute over setting Greece\u2019s primary budget surplus, the positive balance of revenue over spending after debt servicing costs are stripped out. Tspiras is seeking to minimise the primary surplus to give himself more room for spending. The creditors want to set a higher surplus, entrenching more austerity. Tsipras\u2019 case was buttressed on Wednesday when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development issued dismal forecast figures for the Greek economy this year. It reported no growth, higher unemployment and a debt level rising further to 180% of gross domestic product. Before Wednesday evening\u2019s dinner, Tsipras spoke by phone to the German and French leaders. According to French reports, they told him that the eurozone was not presenting an ultimatum and that the proposals remained negotiable.",
