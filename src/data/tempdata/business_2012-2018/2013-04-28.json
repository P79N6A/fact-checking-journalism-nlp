      "bodyText": "Bank lending to UK businesses will go up this year for the first time in four years as economic growth picks up, according to an influential forecasting group, in a boost to government attempts to kickstart a flatlining economy. The prediction comes after the Treasury and Bank of England extended the \u00a380bn Funding for Lending scheme in an attempt to boost support for small businesses, which are still struggling to borrow. Lending is expected to grow by 3% to \u00a3440bn this year, and by 8.5% to \u00a3447bn in 2014, according to a report published on Monday by independent forecaster the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club. The news is a further boost to George Osborne after the chancellor escaped the ignominy of a triple-dip recession last week with the publication of official figures that showed GDP growth of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2013. The flow of money towards British business in the ITEM report would be a dramatic reversal of last year's crackdown on credit, which saw lending to corporates shrink 5%, hitting the lowest level since 2006. \"You might be forgiven for thinking we were still in the midst of the banking crisis,\" said Andy Baldwin, head of financial services in Europe at Ernst &amp; Young. \"But behind the scenes banking fundamentals have quietly been improving and banks are now in a better position to be able to provide funds to the wider economy.\" Nonetheless the optimism of the ITEM forecast is at variance with some of the Bank of England's own soundings, which show that small firms are still faced with a tough lending environment. The main drivers of banks' return to lending would be better access to wholesale funding and a decrease in bad loans, Baldwin said, rather than any marked impact from Funding for Lending, which was launched by the Bank of England last year but has failed to have a marked impact on business lending.

      "body": "<p>The public accounts committee's report highlighting the \"big four\" accountancy firms' conflict of interest in advising the government on tax reform while advising clients on tax avoidance (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/26/accountancy-firms-knowledge-treasury-avoid-tax\" title=\"\">Inside knowledge lets rich off tax hook, says MPs' report</a>, 26 April) is welcome but only scratches the surface of a much bigger problem. The Treasury is not the only department to receive secondments from firms to advise on policy matters in which they have a direct conflict of interest.</p> <p>The role firms such as McKinsey played in the drawing up of the coalition's NHS reforms is well documented. Similarly, it is known that dozens of staff working for energy companies have been seconded to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Any company providing such a central role in the policy formulation of a political party would have to declare such advice as a donation in kind, yet such information must be eked out via FoI requests, which are often frustrated by claims of \"commercial confidentiality\".</p> <p>The benefits of such secondments to companies are obvious: not only do they have the opportunity to influence government policy, but the contacts and experience their staff garner during such periods will help them in the longer term. This competitive advantage is often even paid for by the taxpayer. This situation must be subject to much greater public scrutiny than it is at present. At a minimum, the government should publish a register declaring all such secondments and what they are working on in all departments as a matter of course. At the same time, the coalition must fulfil its promise of a lobbying register so we can see what the policy areas the companies involved are actively seeking to influence.<br><strong>Alexandra Runswick</strong><br><em>Unlock Democracy</em></p> <p>\u2022 These complex structures which have made corporate tax voluntary for large corporations, but company tax compulsory for the small players, thrive because the accounting profession is allowed to get away with claiming a false distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion.

      "bodyText": "The public accounts committee's report highlighting the \"big four\" accountancy firms' conflict of interest in advising the government on tax reform while advising clients on tax avoidance (Inside knowledge lets rich off tax hook, says MPs' report, 26 April) is welcome but only scratches the surface of a much bigger problem. The Treasury is not the only department to receive secondments from firms to advise on policy matters in which they have a direct conflict of interest. The role firms such as McKinsey played in the drawing up of the coalition's NHS reforms is well documented. Similarly, it is known that dozens of staff working for energy companies have been seconded to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Any company providing such a central role in the policy formulation of a political party would have to declare such advice as a donation in kind, yet such information must be eked out via FoI requests, which are often frustrated by claims of \"commercial confidentiality\". The benefits of such secondments to companies are obvious: not only do they have the opportunity to influence government policy, but the contacts and experience their staff garner during such periods will help them in the longer term. This competitive advantage is often even paid for by the taxpayer. This situation must be subject to much greater public scrutiny than it is at present. At a minimum, the government should publish a register declaring all such secondments and what they are working on in all departments as a matter of course. At the same time, the coalition must fulfil its promise of a lobbying register so we can see what the policy areas the companies involved are actively seeking to influence. Alexandra Runswick Unlock Democracy \u2022 These complex structures which have made corporate tax voluntary for large corporations, but company tax compulsory for the small players, thrive because the accounting profession is allowed to get away with claiming a false distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion.

A subset of these rejected schemes could presumably be deemed to be measures to provide information in a manner deliberately to create a false impression to reduce the tax bill.

      "bodyText": "The last time Britain hosted the G8 summit was at Gleneagles in 2005. Tony Blair was prime minister, Gordon Brown chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der chancellor of Germany, and George Bush US president. The world economy was in a sweet spot between the 2001 dress rehearsal for the global financial crisis and the real thing. In the runup to the summit, there was a campaign to force the west's richest countries to commit themselves to three development goals: doubling aid, scrapping unpayable debt and securing a trade deal that would open up global markets for poor countries. It was called Make Poverty History (MPH), and it culminated in a rock concert in Hyde Park, London, and a G8 agreement that delivered on aid and debt, if not trade. In June, David Cameron will host the first UK-based G8 since Gleneagles. It will be held in Enniskillen in Northern Ireland, where Vladimir Putin will be the sole political survivor of those around the table eight years ago. There has again been an attempt to mobilise public support to put pressure on the G8 to tackle global poverty, but the If campaign is a mere shadow of MPH and Jubilee 2000 in the late 1990s. Lacking clarity, cohesion or energy, If has sunk pretty much without trace since its launch three months ago. The G8 leaders are under zero pressure to deliver on any of the four demands of the campaign and are, therefore, unlikely to do so. And, should you be unaware of what the demands are, you are not alone. The idea is that global hunger can be eradicated if governments deliver on their aid promises, if governments and companies are more transparent about their activities, if action is taken to clamp down on corporate tax evasion and if steps are taken to prevent farmers being forced off their land \u2013 all worthy objectives. This is a much tougher economic environment in which to mount a successful campaign. In 2005, the west was blissfully unaware of the impending crisis and decided it was time to sort out the finances of poor countries. In 2013, G8 countries are preoccupied with sorting out their own finances. That much has been obvious for some time at the half-yearly meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The two Bretton Woods institutions are supposed to have equal status but for the past five years the IMF has grabbed the attention. As far as many western policymakers are concerned, middle- and low-income countries seem to be doing fine on their own. A mixture of sounder economic policies, a commodity boom and the financial help made possible by debt relief and increased aid flows has meant growth rates for sub-Saharan Africa in the 5-6%-a-year range. The mood in the west has become less charitable as growth rates have fallen and austerity programmes been imposed. Aid has fallen for the past two years, and, in the World Trade Organisation's Doha round talks, the impasse can, in part, be explained by Washington's insistence that Brazil, China and India should be treated as developed rather than emerging market countries. Policymakers are clearly less engaged with the development agenda than they were in the mid-2000s. None of the G8 leaders are prepared to put in the time and effort of Blair and Brown. Cameron made a speech in Davos that outlined Britain's G8 agenda \u2013 trade liberalisation, action against tax dodgers and transparency about who owns what in developing countries. There has, however, been little evidence since that the prime minister is making much headway in convincing his G8 colleagues to sign up to an international agreement (with the sole exception of the proposed EU-US free trade area, where there has been progress) or even that he is making that much of an effort. Indeed, it was telling that the most impressive intervention from a UK politician at last week's IMF/World Bank meetings came not from George Osborne or the development secretary, Justine Greening, but from Brown, who described the fight for girls' education as the civil rights issue of our time. Yet, courtesy of his decision to stick with Labour's plan to raise Britain's aid budget to 0.7% of national income, Cameron has influence. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, made him one of the three co-chairs of the high-level panel asked to set the framework for development beyond 2015, the target for meeting the millennium development goals. The prime minister deserves credit for refusing to do a U-turn on aid, despite considerable pressure to do so. It is, perhaps, this willingness to face down his own right wing that has ensured that Cameron has been treated with kid gloves by most of the UK development charities. Take, for example, the issue of inequality. The prime minister's view is that there is no need to put the issue at the heart of an anti-poverty agenda because growth is all that is needed. This contradicts the available evidence: India has been growing at twice the pace of Brazil yet has a poorer record for reducing poverty. The World Bank has shown that a percentage point of growth in Brazil cuts poverty by five times the rate in India. It is no accident that this has been the case, since tackling poverty has been central to government policy in Brazil, and the poor have benefited from cash transfers and legislation that has narrowed the gap between the minimum and the average wage. In sub-Saharan Africa, the impressive-looking growth rates in per capita incomes for countries such as Tanzania, Nigeria and Zambia disguise the fact that the benefits have overwhelmingly gone to the richest 10%. In Tanzania, the economy grew 6% a year between 1999 and 2006, yet the incidence of poverty fell by just 1%. Growth is important for developing countries, but the prime minister is wrong if he thinks it is a panacea. Tackling inequality should be central to the post-2015 agenda. That means increased investment in health and education, and stronger social safety nets. It requires trade deals that are not crafted in favour of developed countries and a reformed global financial system that channels credit to job-creating small businesses rather than allowing commodity speculation to run riot. Higher investment is needed not just for roads, ports and railways, but to help the poorest and most vulnerable countries prepare for climate change. There is little chance of Cameron backing this sort of agenda, since it runs counter to what he is doing domestically. The UK development community seems strangely reluctant to point out these contradictions. But isn't that what it is there for?",

      "body": "<p>The last time Britain hosted the G8 summit was at Gleneagles in 2005. Tony Blair was prime minister, Gordon Brown chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der chancellor of Germany, and George Bush US president. The world economy was in a sweet spot between the 2001 dress rehearsal for the global financial crisis and the real thing.</p> <p>In the runup to the summit, there was a campaign to force the west's richest countries to commit themselves to three development goals: doubling aid, scrapping unpayable debt and securing a trade deal that would open up global markets for poor countries. It was called Make Poverty History (MPH), and it culminated in a rock concert in Hyde Park, London, and a G8 agreement that delivered on aid and debt, if not trade.</p> <p>In June, David Cameron will host the first UK-based G8 since Gleneagles. It will be held in Enniskillen in Northern Ireland, where Vladimir Putin will be the sole political survivor of those around the table eight years ago. There has again been an attempt to mobilise public support to put pressure on the G8 to tackle global poverty, but the If campaign is a mere shadow of MPH and Jubilee 2000 in the late 1990s. Lacking clarity, cohesion or energy, If has sunk pretty much without trace since its launch three months ago. The G8 leaders are under zero pressure to deliver on any of the four demands of the campaign and are, therefore, unlikely to do so. And, should you be unaware of what the demands are, you are not alone.</p> <p>The idea is that global hunger can be eradicated if governments deliver on their aid promises, if governments and companies are more transparent about their activities, if action is taken to clamp down on corporate tax evasion and if steps are taken to prevent farmers being forced off their land \u2013 all worthy objectives.</p> <p>This is a much tougher economic environment in which to mount a successful campaign. In 2005, the west was blissfully unaware of the impending crisis and decided it was time to sort out the finances of poor countries. In 2013, G8 countries are preoccupied with sorting out their own finances.</p> <p>That much has been obvious for some time at the half-yearly meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The two Bretton Woods institutions are supposed to have equal status but for the past five years the IMF has grabbed the attention.</p> <p>As far as many western policymakers are concerned, middle- and low-income countries seem to be doing fine on their own.
