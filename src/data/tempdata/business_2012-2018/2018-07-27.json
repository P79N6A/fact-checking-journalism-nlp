      "bodyText": "Drunk passengers have been warned they could face fines of up to \u00a380,000 should a plane have to divert because of disruptive behaviour. Ministers have backed a campaign from the aviation industry to tackle problem drinking, which airlines say shows no sign of abating, despite previous initiatives. Early morning bar openings and duty free sales at airports have been blamed by airlines for a series of costly and potentially dangerous incidents in the air. The One Too Many campaign, which highlights the problems a drunk passenger can cause, will target holidaymakers at airports across Britain this summer. As well as reminding passengers they can be denied boarding if inebriated, an offence on a plane, it warns that penalties could include up to two years in prison and being banned from future flights, as well as hefty fines for diverting a plane. The campaign was launched by the aviation minister, Lady Sugg, on what was expected to be the busiest day of the summer for UK air travel, with almost 9,000 departing flights. Sugg said on Friday: \u201cDisruptive passengers have the potential to ruin other people\u2019s flights, and this campaign is an important new step to ensure all passengers are aware of the consequences they face if they behave disruptively after drinking before or on board a flight.\u201d Civil Aviation Authority figures showed 417 flights were affected by serious passenger misconduct last year. Rafael Schvartzman, of the International Air Transport Association, said: \u201cWhile we should remember that disruptive passenger incidents are still relatively rare, they rank in the top three concerns of cabin crew, and any incident is one too many. Airlines have a zero-tolerance approach to unruly behaviour and cabin crew and passengers have a right to a flight free from disturbance and harassment. The party should be at the destination, not on the plane.\u201d However, some airlines said the campaign did not go far enough. Phil Ward, the managing director of Jet2.com, said he welcomed the initiative but said similar public awareness campaigns launched in the last few years had not reduced incidents of drunken, disruptive passenger behaviour. \u201cAlthough our crew and colleagues are highly trained and do a fantastic job in often difficult circumstances, it is unacceptable that they must be left to manage the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption. At the same time, customers travelling on well-earned holidays should not be subjected to this behaviour,\u201d he said. Ward called for sealed bags preventing the illicit consumption of duty free alcohol, and more rigorous licensing standards in airports. A week ago, three Scottish passengers were arrested off a Jet2 flight landing in Crete after drinking a bottle of duty free gin and threatening to \u201cdo in\u201d staff.",

      "bodyText": "Weeks of warm dry weather have taken their toll on fruit and vegetable growers. Parts of England have had no rain for more than 50 days, and the Agricultural and Horticultural Development Board has said it is the driest runup to harvest in 80 years. Many plants stop growing once temperatures top 25C, and crops without irrigation are especially struggling. Wilting Lettuces Average wholesale prices for lettuce are up nearly 22% year on year as the long spell of warm weather has lifted demand by 40%, while yields are down by 25%. Lettuces stop growing in high temperatures and the heads can be damaged by heat. Wholesalers and farmers have been forced to fly in supplies from abroad to meet contracts with supermarkets. Carrots Yields are expected to be at least 30% down as low rainfall and heat affect crops. Average wholesale prices are up nearly 55% as a result, according to reports in the Grocer magazine. Onions Wholesale prices are up nearly 55% year on year, and the UK\u2019s crop is expected to be 25% smaller this year. A cold wet spring delayed planting and then a lack of rain and high temperatures in June and July put crops under stress. Broccoli and cauliflower Severe shortages are expected as both crops have stopped growing in the heat. Prices of British caulis have surged 81% and broccoli is up by 37%. Potatoes The main crop won\u2019t start to be lifted until September, so a spell of rainfall could change matters, but Guy Smith, the deputy president of the NFU, reckons the crop is likely to be lower than last year \u2013 potentially by as much as 25%. Large baking potatoes could be in particularly short supply. Apples Growers are expecting a crop in line with last year at best unless there is significant rainfall throughout August. While the long sunny spell is likely to mean sweeter fruit, Ali Capper of the English Apples &amp; Pears trade body said growers were currently asking supermarkets to change their specifications so that they would accept smaller fruit. Peas Will be smaller, as will the size of the crop, as the hot, dry weather makes plants wilt and stop producing new fruits. Crops have also been affected by increased attacks from pests such as the pea moth, which thrive in warmer conditions. Arable crops Barley planted in the spring, much of which goes to the brewing industry, has been severely affected. It was planted late because of bad weather earlier in the year and has \u201cbarely known rain\u201d since, according to the NFU\u2019s Guy Smith. He said crops could be at half their normal levels. Winter wheat, barley and oilseed rape, which were well established by the time of the drought, have been less affected, but yields could still be 10% to 20% lower than average, with oilseed rape the most affected. Milk Yields are down as the hot weather has killed off the grass in many areas. Farmers are being forced to use fodder that they would normally save for the winter because there is not enough fresh feed for cows and sheep in the fields. Bumper crop Raspberries A longer season is expected to make up for a 20% shortfall earlier on as growers dealt with the late spring. Cherries The fruit can be damaged by rain, so the sun will bring a sweeter, better-looking crop.",

    "webTitle": "Trump hails US economy as GDP rises at fastest pace since 2014 - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s a clip of president Trump\u2019s comments on the US economy: That\u2019s a good moment to wrap up. Have a good weekend. GW Snap verdict: president Trump is clearly taking today\u2019s growth figure as vindication of his economic policies. That means we can expect more of the same from the White House on trade, tax and spending. Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic advisor, now speaks -- and he backs up Trump\u2019s claim that the US economy will keep growing strongly. Kudlow insists: This is a boom that will be sustainable. Turning away from the economy, president Trump says that the remains of 55 Americans killed in the Korean war are returning to the US. He thanks Kim Jong-Un for sticking to his commitment. Onto trade...and president Trump criticises other countries for stealing US jobs and plundering its wealth. Our tariffs are bringing tariffs back to the US, he continues, saying that the burly steel workers he met in Illinois yesterday were in tears (of joy, presumably). Trump is insisting that his hard line on trade will bring jobs back to America (reminder: his administration is working on a $12bn bailout for US farmers hurt by the row with China) Giving his own trumpet a hearty toot, president Trump now says that his administration have achieved an \u201ceconomic turnaround of historic proportions\u201d. We are the envy of the entire world, he adds, saying that other world leaders are regularly congratulating him on the state of the US economy. President Trump is speaking on the economy now at the White House. He says today\u2019s numbers are \u201cgreat\u201d, and that America is going to go a lot higher. We\u2019re on track for the fastest growth rate in 13 years, the president declares. The US economy is growing much faster than under the previous two administrations, Trump continues. If the current growth rate is maintained, the US economy will double in size 10 years faster than it would have done under presidents Bush or Obama, Trump claims. He also points out that the trade deficit has dropped by over $50bn. Trump insists that the current growth rate is sustainable, and not a single shot boost (some analysts disagree, though) We have the official thumbs up from the White House: Even if this pacey growth doesn\u2019t last, it gives Donald Trump a boost going into the mid-term election this autumn. However, the feelgood factor could face if trade wars hurt the US economy in the coming months. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains: The words \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 can be heard echoing from across the Atlantic this afternoon as the US economy grew 4.1% in the second quarter of 2018, which is the most robust pace in nearly 4-years. Strong export figures, aided by soybean exports in addition to consumer spending, helped the surge in the GDP print. Over the next quarter GDP figures will be scrutinised, as the threat of upcoming tariffs on US exports could dampen the next print. However, it gives Republicans a firm footing ahead of the Midterm elections, as GDP sitting above 3% has been a core pledge for the Trump administration since the beginning of his campaign. Our US business editor, Dominic Rushe, writes: The growth will be a major boon for the Trump administration, which pushed through $1.5tn in tax cuts at the start of the year with a promise that they would be paid for by economic growth. Ahead of the announcement on Thursday, Donald Trump teased that good news could be coming. Breaking with a tradition of presidents refraining from commenting on market sensitive government releases ahead of their release, the president told a rally in Illinois: \u201cSomebody actually predicted today 5.3 [percent growth]. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen ... if it has a four in front of it, we\u2019re happy.\u201d But economists warned the growth spurt may be unsustainable and the evidence so far is that the benefits of the mini-boom have disproportionately gone to the wealthiest Americans. The last time the economy expanded at a comparable pace was in 2014, when growth hit 5.2% in the third quarter. The economic boost was driven by rising consumer spending, exports and business investment over the quarter. More here: Here\u2019s Rob Hodgson, Senior Wealth Manager at GWM Investment Management, on the US GDP figures: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Chief Economic Adviser told us it was going to be \u2018big\u2019 and it\u2019s fair to say that analysts were projecting some exciting figures. A 4.1% growth rate in Q2 is the strongest since the third quarter of 2014. Projections were ranging between 3 and 5 percent and business confidence remains upbeat so we were expecting a strong quarter of growth. We would suggest that 4.1% overstates the underlying pace of activity, but the tax cuts and impacts of deregulation are likely to keep economic growth accelerating from this point.\u201d As this chart shows, America has just posted its strongest quarter since Donald Trump became president. However, growth was still stronger in the middle of 2014, during Barack Obama\u2019s second term. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms have spurred US growth in recent months: \u201cThe US economy is showing the fastest growth since 2014. A strong labour market, benign inflation and strong corporate investment have contributed to this positive landscape for growth. The economy was already on the up before Trump\u2019s tax cuts added further fiscal fuel. The tax cuts are now filtering through to the real economy as companies have been empowered to increase investment spend, the lion share of which is going into technology and automation. Pablo Shah, economist at the CEBR think tank, says America\u2019s growth rate was impressive in the last quarter: While much of the resurgence in US growth can be attributed to somewhat transitory factors, today\u2019s figures remain impressive. A strong labour market coupled with accommodative fiscal and monetary policies are set to sustain solid growth throughout the remainder of the year. However, he also suspects growth will fade over time: The US economy is likely to come off the boil in the coming quarters, as the boost to growth delivered by the tax cuts begins to wear off, trade restrictions and an overall slowing of the global economy start to weigh on exports, and further interest rate hikes tighten financial conditions. The dollar has dipped slightly, despite America\u2019s growth rate jumping. That suggests investors don\u2019t think this growth rate is sustainable. US consumers drove America\u2019s US economic growth in the last three months. Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4% in the last quarter, up from just 0.5% in January-March. Business investment was 7.3% higher. Exports grew by 9.3%, while exports only expanded by 0.5% -- that will please the White House. NEWSFLASH: America\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1% in the last three months, as growth accelerated. That\u2019s the fastest growth rate since 2014, and a very solid result (although not as high as some economists had hoped). It may show that Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts have given the economy a boost. US growth in January-March has also been revised up, to an annual rate of 2.2% from 2%. That\u2019s a lot stronger than France, which grew at an annualised rate of 0.8% in the last quarter (or 0.2% quarter-on-quarter) More to follow! It\u2019s nearly time to discover how fast America\u2019s economy grew in the last quarter. Forecast range from an annualised growth rate of 2.6% all the way up to 4.8%, which would be very pacy. First Facebook\u2019s shares tumble after missing Wall Street forecasts, then Twitter follows suit. So has the social media boom hit a roadblock, or are investors simply over-reacting? Arguably, Wall Street should welcome signs that these companies are getting serious about tackling abuse, fake accounts and disinformation, even if it hits the bottom line. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says there are two theories why shares are tumbling: One, expectations for revenue growth are being fundamentally reset in the social media space. Two, today\u2019s reaction is maybe overdone as investors have been spooked by the horrid earnings call from Facebook. Everyone knew that Twitter was full of fake accounts \u2013 why their removal should be impacting the share price in the way is unclear \u2013 investors may be better advised to keep a check on earnings and revenue growth instead. Both Facebook and Twitter have been affected badly by fake news, fake accounts and accusations of Russian meddling. But arguably Twitter looks in better shape as the efforts to monetise the platform are working, whilst we see fundamental concerns about Facebook\u2019s advertising model.\u201d Twitter says it is determined to tackle \u2018problem behaviour\u2019, even if it does hurt user numers. It tells shareholders: \u201cWe are making active decisions to prioritize health initiatives over near-term product improvements that may drive more usage of Twitter as a daily utility.\u201d Some snap reaction to Twitter\u2019s results: NEWSFLASH: Twitter has just reported that its user numbers have fallen, as it got to grips with fake accounts. The social media/micro-blogging site says monthly users fell by one million in the last three months, to 353 million. Wall Street had expected a rise of one million. Twitter took steps to weed out abusive content providers, and so-called \u2018bots\u2019, to (finally) address concerns from regulators, politicians and the public. But investors aren\u2019t impressed, even though twitter also posted earnings of around $100m or $0.17 per share, in line with forecasts. Shares have slumped by 18% in pre-market trading, matching Facebook\u2019s tumble earlier this week. City traders, mortgage holders, savers and borrowers all need to be alert for a UK interest rate rise next week. The Bank of England sets monetary policy next Thursday, and a rate rise is possible - but not certain. There are arguments to hike, but also to sit tight a bit longer. As Nicholas Wall of Old Mutual Global Investors puts it: For a nation that has endured the trials and tribulations of Love Island over the summer, the original unreliable boyfriend returns next week. Will the Bank of England governor Mark Carney deliver the 0.25% rate hike that the market expects? Here are Wall\u2019sa rguments for a rate hike: Growth may not be that strong, but is reasonable considering the reduced growth potential post-crisis Strong retail sales and manufacturing data (PMIs) High job creation While here are three reasons not to: Brexit uncertainty, which is likely to intensify this autumn Trade war fears - as America threatens China with new tariffs Weak real wages, with earnings only slightly ahead of inflation France\u2019s weak growth this year could mean Paris misses its deficit reduction targets, and push the national debt higher, says economist Emanuele Canegrati: That would be problematic for president Macron as he tries to push for eurozone reforms. Germany will be less receptive of more risk-sharing between euro members if the bloc\u2019s second-largest member is struggling. Global stock markets remain upbeat, as traders count down to 1.30pm BST...when we learn how America\u2019s economy fared in the last quarter. Ken Odeluga of City Index says Wednesday\u2019s peach deal between the US and EU on trade is helping, as are recent financial results. In Europe the stream of earnings is picking up, with a set of pleasing if not spectacular reports on Friday. The car sector remains in sharp focus as an epicentre of the trade conflict on this side of the Atlantic and after the apparent stay of execution due to EU-U.S. rapprochement. With Britain\u2019s FTSE, Germany\u2019s DAX, Italy\u2019s MIB all just slightly higher and Paris\u2019s CAC slightly soft, the atmosphere is constructive for further potential strength though lacks catalysts. In the currency markets, the pound has dropped back below $1.31 against the dollar. Sterling weakened after Brussels\u2019 negotiator Michel Barnier gave Theresa May\u2019s \u2018Chequers Plan\u2019 a punch in the solar plexus. Barnier rejected the UK\u2019s idea of collecting tariffs and duties on goods entering Britain and heading into the European Union, saying that the EU must keep control of its money and borders (sound familiar?....) France\u2019s economy has been a tale of two halves in the last year, as economist Shaun Richards points out. Christopher Dembik of Saxo Bank fears the French economy is facing a negative shock: Here\u2019s our energy correspondent, Adam Vaughan, explaining why BP will be pleased to have acquired BHP\u2019s Billiton\u2019s US shale assets... The deal gives BP a much bigger footprint in oil-rich onshore basins and was described by its chief executive, Bob Dudley, as a \u201ctransformational acquisition\u201d ...and why BHP will be delighted to have got rid of them: BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20bn with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp, but suffered as gas prices collapsed, forcing it to book massive writedowns. \u201cIt was the wrong environment to have bought the assets when they did but this is the right market to have sold them in,\u201d Craig Evans, the co-portfolio manager of the Tribeca Global Natural Resources Fund, said. This chart, from INSEE, shows how France\u2019s growth rate slowed in the last six months, after a solid 2017: The IT meltdown at Britain\u2019s TSB bank has hurt its parent company, Sabadell, rather badly. Sabadell reported this morning that it tumbled into the red in the last quarter, losing \u20ac138.7m in April-June. That period was a nightmare for TSB, and its customers, when an IT migration to a new platform went disastrously wrong, locking customers out of their accounts for days (and in some cases weeks). Sabadell has taken a one-off charge of \u20ac203m for the outage, a bigger hit than expected, to cover compensation and lost business. TSB CEO Paul Pester was heavily criticised for his handling of the crisis. He has told reporters this morning that he plans to stay at the bank, and is \u201c100 percent focused\u201d on putting things right. France\u2019s weak growth figures haven\u2019t alarmed investors. European stocks have opened higher with the FTSE 100 gaining almost 0.3%. The French CAC is 0.2% higher too. In London, consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has surged by 9%. It raised its annual revenue growth target on Friday, following strong growth in its child nutrition business. Telecoms group BT is also leading the risers, up 3% after posting a 3% rise in adjusted profits. European stocks are benefiting from the drop in the euro on Thursday. It shed almost 1% to $1.164, after the European Central Bank sounded dovish about interest rate hike prospects. Here\u2019s Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomic on the French GDP figures: Bloomberg says those French growth figures are a disappointment: The euro area\u2019s second largest economy had a rough start to the year, when it, along with much of Europe, saw output strangled by bad weather and snowstorms. While there\u2019s been a general loss of momentum across many economies this year, France\u2019s slowdown was exacerbated when rail workers staged industrial action to protest President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s reform plans. The continued sluggishness in France is a handicap for the euro area amid a period of uncertainty marked by global trade tensions and the prospect of European Central Bank paring back its vast monetary stimulus. Important energy news: oil giant BP is buying US shale oil and gas assets from mining group BHP Billiton, in a $10.5bn deal. It\u2019s a major deal for BP - its biggest in around two decades, giving it a much more powerful position in the US energy sector. CEO Bob Dudley says: \u201cThis is a transformational acquisition for our Lower 48 business, a major step in delivering our upstream strategy and a world-class addition to BP\u2019s distinctive portfolio. Effectively BP is catching up the ground it lost after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, in which 11 workers died when their rig in the Gulf of Mexico caught fire. Shares in BHP Billiton have jumped over 2% at the start of trading in London -- analysts had only expected these assets to sell for $8-$10bn. BP are down 2%. Economist Philippe Waechter of Ostrum Asset Management says France\u2019s GDP new figures are disappointing. It may mean Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government will fail to hit its growth targets this year. French factories had a lacklustre quarter, with goods production falling in the last three months. INSEE says: Production in goods and services barely accelerated in Q2 2018 (+0.2% after +0.1%). It fell back again in goods (\u22120.3% after \u22120.6%) while it continued to grow in services (+0.4% after +0.3%). Output in manufactured goods fell back again (\u22120.2% after \u22121.0%). Production in refinery stepped back (\u22129.9% after \u22121.6%) due to technical maintenance; production in electricity and gas dropped too (\u22121.7% after +1.9%). However, construction bounced back (+0.6% after \u22120.3%). A wave of strikes by French railway workers and Air France employees hurt growth in the last quarter, it seems. Stats body INSEE blames industrial action across the French transport system for a big drop in transport spending. It says: In services, the slow down was notably driven by the downturn in transport expenses (\u22123.2% after +1.0%), mainly in rail transport as a result of strikes. French rail workers walked out for 26 days between April and June, as part of protest against reforms to the SNCF rail company. This caused disruption to national services, and routes within Paris. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. France\u2019s economy has failed to accelerate. New growth figures show that the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy only grew by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2018. That only matches the slow performance seen in the first three months of 2018, and is weaker than the 0.3% which economists expected. The data highlights how Europe has lost momentum this year, after a rollicking 2017. INSEE, the statistics body, says household spending fell in the last quarter. Trade also held back growth, with imports growing faster than exports: Household consumption expenditures faltered slightly (\u22120.1% after +0.2%), whereas total gross fixed capital formation recovered sharply (GFCF: +0.7% after +0.1%). Overall, final domestic demand excluding inventory changes contributed as much to GDP growth as in Q1 (+0.2 points). Imports bounced back this quarter (+1.7% after \u22120.3%) as did exports to a lesser extent (+0.6% after \u22120.4%). All in all, foreign trade balance contributed negatively to GDP growth, \u22120.3 points, after a neutral contribution in Q1. Conversely, changes in inventories drove GDP on (+0.3 points after 0.0 points). More details to follow... Investors are also desperate to learn how well America\u2019s economy performed in the last quarter. US GDP, due at 1.30pm UK time is likely to show impressive growth, as president Trump\u2019s tax cuts stimulate the economy. White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow told the markets to expecting a \u201cvery good\u201d number - that could mean an annual growth rate over 4%. Also coming up today Amazon has brought some calm to the markets last night by beating profit forecasts. The e-commerce giant racked up record revenues in the quarter, and made twice as large a profit as investors expected. On a conference call with investors, Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, cited growth in Amazon\u2019s \u201cmost profitable areas\u201d, particularly the cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Olsavsky also pointed to the company\u2019s advertising products as contributing to gross profit while \u201cgrowing at a rapid clip\u201d That made up for Facebook\u2019s shocking performance a day earlier, which prompted the biggest one-day loss in Wall Street history.

      "bodyText": "\u201cOh, I rarely use those,\u201d said Manoj Varathodiyil, gesturing at a pair of public electric car chargers at a West Midlands service station. Instead, the GP has plugged his car into a \u201csupercharger\u201d, one of a network built by US electric carmaker Tesla, exclusively for the use of the firm\u2019s customers. Varathodiyil, who went electric because of concerns over air pollution and fossil fuels, is one of Britain\u2019s vanguard of 160,000 early adopters learning to live with a plug-in car. Most of those drivers charge at home (87%) and work (8%). But the government wants to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 and recently laid out its Road to zero plan for getting there, envisaging \u201ca massive expansion\u201d of public chargers. For the 43% of households without off-street parking, that infrastructure will be vital if electric cars are to become the future norm. But what about today? Is the road to zero riddled with potholes? To test the state of infrastructure now, the Guardian embarked on a grand tour of Britain\u2019s car parks, service stations and hotels by driving an electric car from Brighton to Edinburgh. Things started badly. Oil giant Shell recently branched out into electric car charging, so one of its petrol stations in Surrey, just 56 miles into the journey, looked like an ideal coffee stop. But the app could not start the charger. \u201cNo sir, I can\u2019t help you from here,\u201d helpline staff said, but insisted workers at the forecourt were \u201cfamiliar with the procedures\u201d. They were not. Thirty minutes wasted but a more reliable-looking Tesla site 70 miles north beckoned. Fortunately, the Guardian had borrowed a Tesla Model S, which has the longest range of any electric car on sale in the UK, at 319 miles at 70mph, and a price that starts at \u00a366,730 to match. But a closer charger might have been needed for more affordable models, such as the BMW i3 (124-mile range). Chargers are ranked with confusing labels on how quickly they can top up a car\u2019s battery. Fast is better than slow, but rapid is faster than fast, and super is best of all. The Tesla chargers in a Northampton hotel car park were super ones, so half an hour provided another 121 miles of range. Next stop was one of the growing number of rapid chargers at motorway service stations. Signposting was poor but operator Ecotricity\u2019s app was easy enough and, unlike some charging sites, this one in Nottinghamshire had toilets. A short 42-mile drive north ended in the electric equivalent of a satnav guiding you into a lake. The postcode of the charger was a residential road outside Doncaster that led to a dirt road and a dead end. While there are many charger maps \u2013 such as Zap Map, PlugShare, Open Charge Map \u2013 the postcodes and pins are not always perfectly accurate. Surprisingly, they are not built into Google Maps\u2019s route-mapping. There are also a dizzying array of networks \u2013 35, according to Zap Map. The Doncaster charging spot, newly painted in a hotel car park, was part of the Polar network run by Chargemaster, the UK\u2019s biggest network and now owned by BP. Fragmentation, of networks, maps, payment methods and charging cables, is perhaps the biggest problem facing the electric revolution. Many drivers would like contactless bank cards to be accepted, which only some networks currently offer. Researcher and student Sam Earle called the fragmentation \u201cchaotic\u201d, while electric car driver Simon Canfer said: \u201cOverall, I suspect it\u2019s too fragmented for the mainstream.\u201d Margarida James said: \u201cIt is a joke! Too many different companies, you need cards and apps for them all.\u201d As other electric cars drivers noted, they need to plan more than those burning fossil fuels. But the next stop was Harrogate on a whim. Fortunately, a map app threw up a B&amp;B with a charger. \u201cI get quite a few people coming for it,\u201d said Tony Hay, who runs Shannon Court guesthouse and installed two chargers a year ago. It is a slow charger, so an hour\u2019s charge added just 20 miles of range (fine for overnight use by guests, who get the electricity for nothing). After a brief rapid charge at a spa outside Durham \u2013 regular drivers said north-south is a \u201cdoddle\u201d compared with east-west because there are so many rapids \u2013 the last stop in England is Berwick-upon-Tweed. The charger in a maternity ward\u2019s car park was hard to find. Worse, the app did not work, the out-of-hours helpline went through to several people who could not help. They offered a mobile number, which promptly went to voicemail. So no charge for the final 58-mile leg to Edinburgh, a potential headache for an electric car driver with shorter range. Parts of the journey felt like a glimpse of the future, with extremely fast charging points where you can stop for a coffee until an app notification tells you to set off again. But, too often, it feels like being a beta tester, grappling with iffy mapping, broken apps, unhelpful customer support and endless forms. The trip ended with 72 miles of range at an Edinburgh hotel whose electric car point held out the salvation of an overnight charge. But no, the space was occupied by a huge diesel car and the hotel would not move it. The Guardian had been \u201cICEd\u201d, a term to describe the surprisingly common practice of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle owners blocking an electric car charger. The road to zero still has a few speed bumps to overcome.",

      "bodyText": "Eleven people are looking on as a couple argue in bed on the 39th floor of the Shard tower in London. They are not shooting a porn film but indulging in the latest must-have for the wealthy: a private West End theatre production. This week the \u00a310,000-a-night Shangri-La suite of the Shard was transformed into a 1930s apartment for the setting of No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s Tonight at 8:30, a cycle of one-act comic plays. Next week it could be Pinter in your living room, Shakespeare at your Hamptons summer house or even Wilde on the deck of your superyacht. If you have the money, production crews promise to transform any space into a theatre set and actors will create \u201cthe most intimate play you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. The producer Lucy Eaton, 30, said she hit upon the idea of offering the wealthy private performances after putting on a play in a super-rich patron\u2019s house after a theatre pulled out at the last minute. \u201cIt was an incredible experience and the guest said they were so sold on the intimacy of it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought: \u2018This could be an absolutely wonderful idea, bringing theatre to you.\u2019\u201d Eaton and her partners formed the production company Revels in Hand and have put on A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in a walled garden in Chelsea, west London, transformed a private polo field into a living room for Coward\u2019s Ways and Means and flown actors out to New York to put on plays at a wealthy backer\u2019s property in the Hamptons. \u201cThis is theatre in its purest form. Inviting actors to one\u2019s home or to a private gathering was the thing to do in Shakespearean times and it\u2019s our ambition to revive this definitive form of entertainment, so loved by the aristocracy and royalty,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cYou and your guests are so up close and personal with the actors you can see the laughter lines.\u201d The intimate experience does not come cheap. The average price of production is \u00a35,000 and longer or more complex plays can cost a lot more. \u201cIt is expensive,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cBut it really is an elite luxury experience for lords, sheikhs and CEOs.\u201d She said her company had created productions for all three categories but she was prevented from sharing the details because of non-disclosure agreements. The weirdest location so far, she said, was a polo field at a country estate near London. \u201cThe funniest thing was we were offering two plays at the time \u2013 one was set in a living room and the other was A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d she said. \u201cThey asked for the living room one, despite the polo field kind of being perfect for A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. They got their staff to move a vast amount of furniture on to the polo field to make it a living room.\u201d Other bookings have included weddings, where Revels in Hand performed extracts from As You Like It in the aisle just the after the \u201cI dos\u201d). The production company has also been booked to perform on a yacht in the Mediterranean. \u201cIt should be like a much more culturally sound version of watching a chick flick,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve joked that we\u2019re competing with Netflix but without a TV screen \u2013 it is your living room or garden that the characters are inhabiting.\u201d Olivia, a 42-year-old executive in the City who did not want to give her surname, said she had twice booked Revels in Hand to perform at her house in Chelsea. For a John Van Druten play arranged for her children, guests were welcomed with canap\u00e9s and drinks before one of the characters burst into the room with his first line. \u201cThere was a palpable sense of excitement and \u2018what\u2019s going on here?\u2019,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cIn the front or second row you feel so exposed; they are just lying on the bed right there. You could reach out and touch them.\u201d She said the experience was a lot more exciting and funnier than going to a theatre \u201cand you have champagne and canap\u00e9s circling throughout the performance\u201d. The executive also booked the company for her 40th birthday party. \u201cI have seen well over a 100 productions over the last few years in London and New York, and this was the only time I felt part of the play,\u201d she said. \u201cThey really draw you in and they make it personal. At the end all of our friends were on their feet. \u201cAnd, afterwards they [the actors] stayed for a glass of wine before dinner. How many times have you gone to the theatre and wanted to tell the actors to their faces how great they were. With this you really can.\u201d She declined to state how much the productions cost, saying only that it was \u201ca lot of money\u201d. She added: \u201cBut it is really special. People do all sorts of lavish things with their money but with this what you get really is incredible. It truly is like having the West End in your sitting room.\u201d Eaton, who studied at the University of Cambridge and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, conceded that the cost was out of reach of the vast majority of people. However, the public can book tickets to see the Coward plays at the Shard for \u00a385, or for \u00a3685 (including a one-night stay in the hotel). She said actors were keen to perform at Revels in Hand productions because it gave them a fresh challenge and a glimpse inside the world of the super-rich. \u201cThe joy is we ring established actors having wonderful careers and they\u2019re excited,\u201d she said. \u201cThey enjoy performing in stunning homes and gardens with a glass of champagne afterwards.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Eleven people are looking on as a couple argue in bed on the 39th floor of the Shard tower in London. They are not shooting a porn film but indulging in the latest must-have for the wealthy: a private West End theatre production.</p> \n<p>This week the \u00a310,000-a-night Shangri-La suite of the Shard was transformed into a 1930s apartment for the setting of No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s Tonight at 8:30, a cycle of one-act comic plays. Next week it could be Pinter in your living room, Shakespeare at your Hamptons summer house or even Wilde on the deck of your superyacht. If you have the money, production crews promise to transform any space into a theatre set and actors will create \u201cthe most intimate play you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d.</p> \n<p>The producer Lucy Eaton, 30, said she hit upon the idea of offering the wealthy private performances after putting on a play in a super-rich patron\u2019s house after a theatre pulled out at the last minute. \u201cIt was an incredible experience and the guest said they were so sold on the intimacy of it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought: \u2018This could be an absolutely wonderful idea, bringing theatre to you.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6a28a9d1-5da2-41c2-889c-8105c89be9a8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gw5_rTJIhJM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Eaton and her partners formed the production company Revels in Hand and have put on A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in a walled garden in Chelsea, west London, transformed a private polo field into a living room for Coward\u2019s Ways and Means and flown actors out to New York to put on plays at a wealthy backer\u2019s property in the Hamptons.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is theatre in its purest form. Inviting actors to one\u2019s home or to a private gathering was the thing to do in Shakespearean times and it\u2019s our ambition to revive this definitive form of entertainment, so loved by the aristocracy and royalty,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cYou and your guests are so up close and personal with the actors you can see the laughter lines.\u201d</p> \n<p>The intimate experience does not come cheap. The average price of production is \u00a35,000 and longer or more complex plays can cost a lot more. \u201cIt is expensive,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cBut it really is an elite luxury experience for lords, sheikhs and CEOs.\u201d She said her company had created productions for all three categories but she was prevented from sharing the details because of non-disclosure agreements.</p> \n<p>The weirdest location so far, she said, was a polo field at a country estate near London. \u201cThe funniest thing was we were offering two plays at the time \u2013 one was set in a living room and the other was A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d she said. \u201cThey asked for the living room one, despite the polo field kind of being perfect for A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. They got their staff to move a vast amount of furniture on to the polo field to make it a living room.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other bookings have included weddings, where Revels in Hand performed extracts from As You Like It in the aisle just the after the \u201cI dos\u201d). The production company has also been booked to perform on a yacht in the Mediterranean.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt should be like a much more culturally sound version of watching a chick flick,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve joked that we\u2019re competing with Netflix but without a TV screen \u2013 it is your living room or garden that the characters are inhabiting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Olivia, a 42-year-old executive in the City who did not want to give her surname, said she had twice booked Revels in Hand to perform at her house in Chelsea.

      "bodyText": "The rail regulator has blamed \u201csystemic failings\u201d at Network Rail for the massive disruption caused to passengers by the botched May timetable change. An investigation by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) found that Network Rail had \u201cfailed to comply with its licence requirements to run an efficient and effective process\u201d, which meant train operators could not plan and meet their obligations to passengers. The ORR said that while Network Rail had not implemented best practice, it was not solely to blame for the fiasco in May, which saw thousands of trains cancelled across Govia Thameslink Railway and Arriva Rail North networks in particular. The investigation was launched in February when timetabling problems first became apparent. Its findings will now feed in to a separate ORR inquiry that was commissioned by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, following the disruption in May. Meanwhile, the ORR has demanded Network Rail take action to address the failings it identified, and to provide more assurance for timetable changes due in December and next May \u2013 though these have been scaled down already to minimise the chances of a repeat of the chaos caused in May. It will require Network Rail to report by 31 August to show it is running \u201can efficient, fair, effective and transparent process\u201d for the next timetable change; to show progress in agreeing timetables 12 weeks in advance once more; to show by mid-September that it has bolstered the capability and resources of its timetabling department; and to reform its structures to make sure timetable planners and engineering project managers better coordinate their work. John Larkinson, ORR\u2019s director, railway markets and economics, said: \u201cNetwork Rail\u2019s failings in the run-up to the May timetable led to massive disruption, uncertainty and inconvenience to passengers. \u201cNetwork Rail has acted to bring the industry together to address timetabling issues, but more and faster change is needed to provide assurance to passengers. That is why we have set out these actions designed to improve capability within Network Rail. \u201cOur ongoing broader inquiry is looking at the role of the whole industry in the May timetabling problems and this may lead to further recommendations.\u201d The first investigation was launched in February after Network Rail notifed the industry that it was only able to deliver timetables six weeks ahead. Throughout the year, ongoing timetables may be tweaked for engineering works but should be finalised with 12 weeks\u2019 notice to allow companies to plan, and passengers to book advance tickets. Jo Kaye, a managing director at Network Rail, said: \u201cWe accept the findings of the ORR investigation into why timetables weren\u2019t finalised 12 weeks in advance. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the ORR\u2019s investigation that the issues with timetabling go much further than Network Rail, and we welcome and look forward to the industry-wide inquiry. We remain truly sorry for the part we played in the process that caused disruption for so many people and we have learned lessons to make sure it is not repeated. \u201cWe are already putting the ORR\u2019s required plan into action, including establishing new joint working arrangements with train operators to support development of the timetables for December 2018 and May 2019.\u201d The ORR said it would set out a long-term and fundamental review of timetabling in the autumn.",

    "webTitle": "US economy growing at annual rate of 4.1%, fastest pace in four years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy roared ahead in the second quarter of 2018, growing at an annual rate of 4.1%, its fastest pace in four years, the commerce department announced on Friday. The growth will be a major boon for the Trump administration, which pushed through $1.5tn in tax cuts at the start of the year with a promise that they would be paid for by economic growth. Ahead of the announcement on Thursday, Donald Trump teased that good news could be coming. Breaking with a tradition of presidents refraining from commenting on market sensitive government releases ahead of their release, Trump told a rally in Illinois: \u201cSomebody actually predicted today 5.3[% growth]. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen ... if it has a four in front of it, we\u2019re happy.\u201d At a press conference on Friday, Trump called the figures \u201camazing\u201d. \u201cThese numbers are very sustainable, this isn\u2019t a one-time shot,\u201d he said. He said the next report from the commerce department, which will come in October shortly before the midterm elections, will be \u201coutstanding\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce again we are the economic envy of the entire world.\u201d But economists warned the growth spurt may be unsustainable and the evidence so far is that the benefits of the mini-boom have disproportionately gone to the wealthiest Americans. The last time the economy expanded at a comparable pace was in 2014, when growth hit 5.2% in the third quarter. The commerce department report showed the economic boost was driven by rising consumer spending, exports and business investment over the quarter. Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4% in the last quarter, up from just 0.5% in January to March. Business investment was 7.3% higher. The pace of growth may be difficult to maintain \u2013 the economy grew 2.3% in the whole of 2017, and GDP growth hasn\u2019t crossed the 3% mark for a whole year in 14 years. In the first quarter of the year gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the widest measure of the economy \u2013 grew at an annual rate of just 2.2%, meaning the average for the six months is 3.1%. The second quarter was a sweet spot for the US economy, coming after Trump\u2019s massive tax cuts but before his tariffs rattled global trade. It is still too early to gauge the ultimate impact of the tax cuts but there are worrying signs that the package, meant to spur investment and hiring, has instead gone straight into the pockets of investors. In May, American companies announced a record $201bn in stock buybacks \u2013 where companies buy their own shares in order to boost the share price. The S&amp;P 500 companies are set to repurchase as much as $800bn in stock this year, a new record. But the majority of the benefit of those buybacks will go to the richest Americans. Some 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households and the top 1% of households own nearly 38% of all stock, according to research by New York University economist Edward Wolff. In the meantime wage growth has remained lackluster, a trend that has continued unabated since the end of the recession and has so far been unaffected by the Trump presidency. Tax revenues have fallen and the US budget deficit is on course surpass $1tn by 2020, two years sooner than previously estimated, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, said it was difficult to assess the state of the US economy from one quarter\u2019s GDP figures. \u201cTax cuts have provided a bit of stimulus, particularly for people who own a lot of stock and are paying less tax,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s cheapest and most complained-about energy supplier has ceased trading, in a collapse that has prompted calls for tougher tests on new entrants to the market. The energy regulator Ofgem said Iresa\u2019s 100,000 customers would not see an interruption to their electricity and gas supplies and should \u201csit tight\u201d until it appointed a new supplier. Iresa had already been banned from taking on new customers since March because of its customer service failings. Its failure on Friday followed the collapse of the small suppliers Future Energy in February and GB Energy in 2016. The cost of appointing a new energy firm, a process known as supplier of last resort, is borne by all energy bill payers. The closure of GB Energy, which had 160,000 customers, cost \u00a314m. Iresa came bottom of a recent ranking of energy companies\u2019 customer service, with a record high of 9,000 complaints per 100,000 customers. In one egregious case, a customer switched away from Iresa to a new supplier only to find their credit balance had been wiped, and they had yet to receive a reply from Iresa. Ofgem said households supplied by the firm should take meter readings as soon as possible and wait to be contacted by a new company appointed by the regulator. It is not known yet which companies are in the frame. \u201cIf you are an Iresa customer there is no need to worry as we will make sure your energy supplies are secure and your credit balance is protected,\u201d said Rob Salter-Church, Ofgem\u2019s interim executive director for consumers and markets. The consumer group Citizen\u2019s Advice advised customers against switching supplier now as they may lose refunds owed to them. Medium-sized suppliers including Shell-owned First Utility and Cooperative Energy have been among those in the industry warning that some small firms would soon collapse. Rising wholesale energy prices this year have put extra pressure on companies. In total, four energy suppliers have gone bust since 2008, according to Ofgem. Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said increased competition from challenger suppliers was important, but not at any cost. \u201cIt is time that much stricter tests were set up before firms are granted licences,\u201d he said. Ofgem recently launched a review that could lead to new energy suppliers facing financial health checks. Iresa\u2019s website offered no apology to households but said: \u201cCustomers need not worry, their supplies are secure and credit balances are protected.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT has revealed another accounting error after its pension deficit was underestimated by \u00a3500m. The telecommunications company, which had \u00a38bn wiped off its stock market value in 2017 after admitting to an accounting scandal at its Italian unit, blamed the latest gaffe on an \u201cisolated human error\u201d. The error was made by BT\u2019s independent actuary, Willis Towers Watson, in its calculation of the company\u2019s pension deficit at 31 March. The restated pension deficit stands at \u00a33.9bn as at the end of June. Simon Lowth, BT\u2019s chief financial officer, said: \u201cWe have received assurances from Willis Towers Watson that there are no other errors. As you would expect, we are undertaking further review procedures around that calculation. \u201cWe spent a lot of time with WTW making sure we understand what created the error. It was an isolated human error that they identified. We are also working on what they need to do to strengthen their controls.\u201d Following the \u00a3530m Italian accounting scandal, which cost the outgoing BT chief executive, Gavin Patterson, \u00a34m in bonus payouts, the company\u2019s accountant, PWC, was eventually fired. BT would not comment on its future relationship with WTW. Lowth pointed out the error had no impact on the company\u2019s profits, cashflow, the triennial valuation of its pension deficit conducted last year, or any members of the BT pension scheme. Nevertheless, another financial error was the last thing BT needed. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cClearly this slip doesn\u2019t inspire confidence.\u201d BT said the correction amounted to less than 1% of its total pension liabilities of just over \u00a357bn. WTW said the error was due to \u201can actuarial assumption not being accurately reflected in our actuarial calculations\u201d. \u201cWillis Towers Watson has stringent controls in place to confirm the accuracy of the calculations that we provide to clients, and the error has now been corrected,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe are working closely with BT to support their review of the matter.\u201d Patterson, who said he would still be in place in November to deliver the company\u2019s half-year results, said BT had made a good start to the year. \u201cWe are making positive progress against our strategy,\u201d he said. In the first quarter, Patterson said, it had made the first 900 of a planned 13,000 job cuts over the next three years to save \u00a31.5bn. BT\u2019s financial performance for the second quarter was slightly ahead of forecasts, and the company reaffirmed its guidance for full-year revenue and profit. This prompted a 4% share price rise as investors responded positively after a string of negative news that had left its share price down more than one-quarter in the past year. Total revenue for the quarter was down 2% to \u00a35.7bn. Reported profit before tax was up 68% to \u00a3704m, due to the hit the company took relating to the Italian accounting scandal. Adjusted profit was up 3% at \u00a3816m. Net debt increased to \u00a311.2bn from \u00a38.8bn. The company has stopped reporting broadband and TV subscriber numbers, which fell in the past two quarters, as it focuses on increasing average revenue per customer rather than the number of sign-ups. Paolo Pescatore, an independent telecoms analyst, said: \u201cAll providers will be seeking to lure households with attractive offers ahead of the new Premier League season. BT must do a better job of signing up TV subscribers and maximise BT Sport across its base.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "TSB has crashed into the red as a result of the IT meltdown that left customers locked out of their accounts. The compensation and repair bill has reached \u00a3176m, the bank admitted on Friday \u2013 but the final cost is likely to be higher after TSB revealed it had so far resolved only a third of the 135,403 complaints it received. The payouts that followed a botched IT transfer from its former parent Lloyds to the new owner, Sabadell, a Spanish bank, in April pushed TSB into a first-half loss of \u00a3107.4m, compared with a profit of \u00a3108.3m in the same period last year. The bank admitted that while its mobile app, online and telephone banking services are \u201cmuch improved\u201d, problems remain. The chief executive, Paul Pester, who defied calls to resign over the handling of the meltdown, said: \u201cWe\u2019re making progress in resolving the service problems customers experienced following our IT migration and we will continue to work tirelessly until we have put things right.\u201d The bank\u2019s results revealed how many customers have ditched the bank or taken out money since the IT problems emerged. Savings balances fell by nearly \u00a31bn, while 26,000 account holders switched to other banks. Breaking down the \u00a3176m bill, TSB has so far paid \u00a3115.8m in direct customer redress, \u00a330.7m to fix \u201coperating defects\u201d and \u00a329.9m in lost income after it waived fees and charges to customers. However, TSB said it remains one of the most financially secure banks in the UK and despite the highly publicised problems it had attracted 20,000 new customers. \u201cTSB\u2019s liquidity is robust while our capital position remains one of the strongest of the UK banks,\u201d it said. TSB was heavily criticised for its initially slow response to the crisis but has since hired 1,800 people and redeployed 700 staff internally to help stabilise its services. Further compensation payouts will result in the bank recording further losses in 2018. It said operating costs in the second half of the year would \u201cremain elevated\u201d as it resolved customer complaints. \u201cNo TSB customer will be left out of pocket as a result of these IT issues and no customer complaint will go unanswered. To ensure customers are compensated properly and as quickly as possible, TSB has created a dedicated and experienced team with more than 260 people,\u201d it said. The IT transfer that took place over the weekend of 20-22 April is likely to go down as one of the most financially disastrous \u201cupgrades\u201d by any major bank. The accounts reveal that while it saved TSB the fee it was paying Lloyds, this was offset by a charge of \u00a3318m for migration-related costs. TSB pointed the figure of blame at Sabis, Sabadell\u2019s IT unit. \u201cOn 22 April 2018 TSB moved from an IT system rented from Lloyds Banking Group to a new IT system provided by Sabis. As TSB outlined to the Treasury select committee in June, from internal investigations it appears that the design of the platform itself is robust but that the deployment on to the technical infrastructure led to many of the problems. TSB and Sabis therefore shifted the focus of the internal investigation towards the testing regime in Sabis and its providers.\u201d The bank said an independent review was being carried out by the law firm Slaughter and May to determine why the problems occurred. \u201c This review is under way and TSB will report and act on the findings,\u201d it said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Facebook is growing more slowly than expected and the list of explanations is long. Was it purely the impact of the Cambridge Analytica scandal? How much did the EU\u2019s well-timed data privacy regulations contribute? What about Facebook\u2019s slow progress in selling adverts against the new photo-sharing Stories product? Even the company\u2019s management was unable or unwilling to untangle the various factors. In the absence of clarity, investors have to rely on the hard numbers \u2013 or, rather, projections of the numbers. On that score, the outlook for Facebook is radically different from the cloudless horizon previously assumed. The biggest single change is in profit margins. Facebook used to run on 50%. Now it is heading towards the high 30s within two years, said its chief financial officer, David Wehner, because costs are rising faster than revenues. The other significant issue is the rate of user growth. In the recent past, 40% was the norm but now 20% looks more likely. Indeed, in Europe, Facebook lost users in the last quarter and the figures in the US were roughly flat. Even on those lower percentages, Facebook would be able to increase profits at 25% a year into the middle distance, which is why a chorus of fans declared that the 20% slump in the share price was a gross over-reaction. Well, maybe, but Wednesday night\u2019s statement was essentially a profits warning. At any other large consumer-facing company \u2013 a retailer, a consumer goods firm or an old-fashioned media outfit \u2013 investors would be asking if the first major shift in the financial weather heralds a storm to come. In Facebook\u2019s case, there are extra reasons for caution. The corporate reputation is under intense scrutiny for virtually the first time. Management\u2019s ability to handle complex issues to do with data privacy, political campaigning and fake news is unknown, but the early indicators were dreadful. The initial reaction to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, revealed in the Observer, was slow and cackhanded. Yes, it is possible that, in a year\u2019s time, Wednesday\u2019s statement will appear as a mere blip. Yet the shares are priced at 30 times earnings. One could call that low by whizzy technology yardsticks but, by normal standards, it\u2019s an optimistic rating for a company where so many medium and long-term uncertainties have arrived at once. It\u2019s sounds odd to say, but $110bn off the market cap looks about right. Intu boss departs after Hammerson deal falls through Chief executive David Fischel is heading outta Intu and you can\u2019t blame him. His big \u00a33.4bn deal to sell the shopping centre group \u2013 owner of the Trafford Centre, Lakeside and Metrocentre \u2013 fell apart when would-be buyer Hammerson\u2019s shareholders said no. Someone else can have the job of living up to the brave boast that Intu is \u201cstrongly placed to prosper as a standalone business\u201d. That assessment is not shared by the stock market, where Intu\u2019s shares fell 8% on Thursday as the group said its properties are worth \u00a3650m, or 6%, less than six months ago. Intu\u2019s shares now trade at roughly half net asset value, expressing the fear that there is more pain in store for owners of shopping centres in the era of internet shopping. Intu\u2019s writedown should heap more embarrassment on Hammerson\u2019s chairman, David Tyler, and chief executive, David Atkins. Six months ago they were willing to pay 254p for Intu versus the new all-time low for the share price of 165p. The gulf is enormous, and rather proves the revolting shareholders\u2019 point that doubling-down on UK shopping centres would have been a bad mistake. Atkins this week tried to repair the damage with a strategic revamp. Good try, but the post-Intu credibility deficit in Hammerson\u2019s boardroom remains. Coaches are the better route for National Express Dean Finch, the chief executive of National Express, says his board should take him outside and shoot him if he ever proposes getting back into UK rail franchising. You can see his point. National Express was big in UK rail until it got thrown off the east coast mainline in 2009 under old management, at which point the share price fell below 100p. Finch completed the exit, selling the last franchises when he judged that bidding was getting too hot and political hassles too great. Subsequent expansion has concentrated on school buses in north America and buses and coaches in Spain, which is proving easier territory. After record half-year profits, the share price is now 421p. That\u2019s good news for National Express investors, but Chris Grayling may not agree. Somehow the transport secretary has to entice capital into the poorly defined world of public-private rail partnerships and the hell of timetable revisions. More than a few investors may take the National Express approach and give it a miss.",

      "bodyText": "BP has agreed to buy US shale oil and gasfields from the Anglo-Australian miner BHP for $10.5bn (\u00a38bn), in the UK firm\u2019s biggest acquisition in nearly two decades. Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, lauded the deal as transformational and industry watchers said the move significantly beefed up the company\u2019s US shale presence, which was small compared to peers. The acquisition will boost BP\u2019s US oil and gas production by nearly a fifth and marks a new period of growth for the company, which is emerging after years under the $65bn burden of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. In total, 470,000 acres of assets are covered in the deal, including fields in the Permian in west Texas, the Eagle Ford in south Texas and Haynesville in east Texas and Louisiana. Analysts said Eagle Ford was the most valuable of the three because of its scale and economics, while the Permian offered the greatest long-term promise. BHP bought the fields in 2011 but has struggled to make them work, putting them up for sale last August. BP said it believed its approach would differ by bringing $350m of synergies from its other US operations and capital efficiencies. Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP\u2019s upstream division, said: \u201cIt gives us access to some of the best acreage in the best basins. It takes us into the very heart of the most-talked-about oil play in the world [the Permian].\u201d The UK oil giant was \u201cnot desperate to do a deal\u201d he added but BP believed the quality of the resources made the acquisition worthwhile. After the deal is completed BP\u2019s US production will climb from 744,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 885,000 boe/d. \u201cBP was previously underweight to US tight oil compared to its peers. This deal transforms BP\u2019s US business,\u201d Maxim Petrov, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said. BP said it was making \u201cconservative assumptions\u201d about how much oil and gas could be pumped to begin with, given regional bottlenecks around infrastructure such as pipelines. \u201cWe think the infrastructure will get built out over the next two years,\u201d Looney said. The acquisition will be fully paid for in cash and is being part-funded by the company divesting its interests in the Greater Kuparuk Area in Alaska, which will raise $5-6bn. The scale of BP\u2019s deal dwarfs its recent $200m investment in Europe\u2019s biggest solar company and its \u00a3130m purchase of the UK\u2019s largest electric car charging network. BHP said it would return the proceeds to investors and shares ended the day up 2.3% in Australia, to A$34.40. BP\u2019s share price fell by 1.5%. The company\u2019s last biggest transaction was when it bought the American oil company Atlantic Richfield in 1999.",
