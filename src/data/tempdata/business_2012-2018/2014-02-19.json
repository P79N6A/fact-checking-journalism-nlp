      "body": "<p>Federal Reserve officials started to debate raising interest rates in January, with some arguing they might need to move sooner than expected, minutes of the meeting revealed on Wednesday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/20/federal-reserve-stimulus-interest-rates\">The Fed has kept interest rates at close to zero since the end of the financial crisis in 2008</a>. According to minutes of the 28-29 January meeting, released after the customary three-week lag: \u201cA few participants raised the possibility that it might be appropriate to increase the federal funds rate relatively soon.\u201d</p> <p>The officials were concerned about inflation but others argued inflation was too low. </p> <p>Any rise is unlikely in the short term. Most Fed officials continued to believe it would not be appropriate to raise short-term rates until 2015 or later, according to economic projections officials submitted at their December meeting. They also argued that standard policy tools did not apply, as the US economy continues to feel the impact of the recession.</p> <p>The Fed had previously suggested any rise in interest rates would be linked to the unemployment rate falling below 6.5%. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/07/us-employment-job-market-department-labour\">Last month unemployment dipped to 6.6%, but problems remain in the jobs market</a>. The percentage of people no longer seeking work is at 30-year highs.

      "bodyText": "Federal Reserve officials started to debate raising interest rates in January, with some arguing they might need to move sooner than expected, minutes of the meeting revealed on Wednesday. The Fed has kept interest rates at close to zero since the end of the financial crisis in 2008. According to minutes of the 28-29 January meeting, released after the customary three-week lag: \u201cA few participants raised the possibility that it might be appropriate to increase the federal funds rate relatively soon.\u201d The officials were concerned about inflation but others argued inflation was too low. Any rise is unlikely in the short term. Most Fed officials continued to believe it would not be appropriate to raise short-term rates until 2015 or later, according to economic projections officials submitted at their December meeting. They also argued that standard policy tools did not apply, as the US economy continues to feel the impact of the recession. The Fed had previously suggested any rise in interest rates would be linked to the unemployment rate falling below 6.5%. Last month unemployment dipped to 6.6%, but problems remain in the jobs market. The percentage of people no longer seeking work is at 30-year highs. Long-term and youth unemployment are also high, as are the jobless rates for African Americans and hispanics. The Fed open markets committee (FOMC) minutes show the central bank is now assessing what to do when unemployment hits its former target. \u201cParticipants agreed that, with the unemployment rate approaching 6.5%, it would soon be appropriate for the Committee to change its forward guidance in order to provide information about its decisions regarding the federal funds rate after that threshold was crossed,\u201d the minutes state. The Fed was not specific about what those changes would be. The news came as the Fed appeared to largely shrug off disappointing monthly jobs reports from the Labor Department; in December the US added just 74,000 new jobs. A report published after the Fed meeting showed continued weakness in January, with the US adding just 113,000 jobs for the month, well below recent monthly gains. \u201cA number of participants indicated that the December payrolls figure may have been an anomaly, perhaps importantly reflecting bad weather, and it was noted that the initial readings on payrolls in recent years had subsequently tended to be revised up,\u201d the minutes state. December\u2019s disappointing jobs figures did not deter the Fed\u2019s decision to cut back on its quantitative easing (QE) economic stimulus programme. QE is currently pumping $65bn a month into the bond markets, in an attempt to keep down interest rates and encourage investment. The rate was cut by $10bn after January\u2019s meeting. \u201cSeveral participants argued that, in the absence of an appreciable change in the economic outlook, there should be a clear presumption in favour of continuing to reduce the pace of purchases by a total of $10bn at each FOMC meeting,\u201d the minutes said.

In its assessment of global prospects published ahead of the meeting of G20 finance ministers in Sydney, the IMF said recovery from the deep global recession had been disappointingly weak and urged stronger co-operation between developed and developing countries to promote growth and financial stability. \"A new risk stems from very low inflation in the euro area, where long-term inflation expectations might drift down, raising deflation risks in the event of a serious adverse shock to activity,\" the Fund said. It added that the eurozone was \"turning the corner\" from recession to a recovery that was uneven and fragile. Low inflation added to the problems of the troubled countries on the fringes of the euro area, where it would increase the real burden of already high levels of public debt. \"In the euro area, more monetary easing is needed to raise the prospects of achieving the ECB's inflation objective, including by supporting demand, given the weak and fragile growth, large output gaps and very low inflation,\" said the Washington-based IMF. It said further ECB action could include cheap loan schemes, possibly targeted at small and medium sized firms, and \"further rate cuts, including mildly negative deposit rates, to support demand and reduce fragmentation\" The Fund urged the US to consult with other members of the G20 \u2013 a group of leading advanced and emerging nations \u2013 about its plans to withdraw gradually the stimulus provided to the American economy. \"Concerns about the withdrawal of unconventional monetary policy [the bond buying programme known as quantitative easing] in the US have already provoked sharp price movements in emerging markets\", the Fund said. It added that the return to normal conditions would lead to capital flowing out of emerging markets, \"with risks of lower investment and, potentially, financial disruptions, notably in those with domestic weaknesses.\" The Fund stressed that advanced economies should avoid removing stimulus too quickly given that there was still a large amount of slack to be used up, inflation was very low and governments were trying to reduce budget deficits. \"There is scope for better cooperation on unwinding unconventional monetary policies, including through wider central bank discussions of exit plans. In the euro area, repairing bank balance sheets remains critical to monetary policy transmission.

The comments came in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, which said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr. Bullard said the recent decline in the jobless rate is real, downplaying concerns that it is partly driven by a decline in the number of Americans in the labor force.</p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is then you should take the signal from the unemployment rate decline as a signal of an improving labor market and an improving economy,\u201d Mr. Bullard said.</p> <p>Mr. Bullard, who has expressed concern about low inflation, says he expects it to return to the central bank\u2019s official 2% target. \u201cThe main factor driving inflation is inflation expectations. Those have remained relatively well-anchored up to now and that\u2019s why my forecast for inflation is that it will go back to target,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, he added that further declines in key inflation measures, currently hovering around 1%, would put pressure on Fed officials to take some sort of policy action to drive it higher.</p> <p>Mr. Bullard is forecasting the U.S. economy will grow 3% or more this year, bolstered by the fading drag from tight fiscal policy from Washington.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy is much closer than normal than what we\u2019re used to thinking about over the last five years,\u201d Mr. Bullard said. As for a recent batch of bad data: \u201cMy gut instinct is that weather has been an important factor during this period,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The rosier backdrop raises the bar for any pause in the Fed\u2019s steady reduction in bond buys.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be a powerful signal if we decided to deviate from our taper,\u201d Mr. Bullard said.</p> </blockquote> <p>Full report here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/02/19/feds-bullard-sees-steady-taper/?KEYWORDS=james+bullard\">Fed\u2019s Bullard sees steady taper</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5304cde9e4b0911693db6d0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-19T15:31:16.964Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>The Portuguese economy may have turned the corner,</b> <b>the IMF said in i<a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2014/02/19/portugal-completing-the-job/\">ts latest report on the country</a></b>. Here is the summary:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no doubt that Portugal has made remarkable progress over the past three years. When the sovereign lost access to international bond markets in 2011, the outlook was grim. The economy was facing large domestic and external imbalances and dismal growth prospects. Unprecedented official financing from Portugal\u2019s European partners and the IMF provided a window of opportunity to address the weaknesses at the root of the crisis and regain market confidence. While constrained by formal and informal strictures, the authorities rose to the occasion.</p> <p>The authorities have made substantial progress in fiscal adjustment, while needing to frontload it in view of the high debt burden and to establish fiscal policy credibility. However, it is important to recognize that fiscal targets were relaxed when it was possible to do so, to avoid more severe consequences on growth. All told, about two-thirds of the structural fiscal effort necessary to comply with the European Fiscal Compact\u2019s medium-term objectives has now been completed.</p> <p>Equally important, wide-ranging structural reforms were enacted in spite of difficult socio-economic circumstances and legal hurdles. The government took steps to improve the functioning of the labor and product markets and make the business environment more conducive to growth. External adjustment has exceeded expectations implying a lower need to borrow from overseas; and financial stability has been preserved. The economy now shows early signs that it may have turned the corner. In light of the progress on all of these fronts, foreign bond market investors seem reassured, and sovereign yields recently dipped to their lowest level since April 2010.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5304cbb4e4b0911693db6d0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-19T15:28:13.177Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile more protests are taking place in Athens today:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-241dbb5d-642c-4d59-a85f-e2c1a3aa9097\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/19/1392823216349/c0853536-8e82-4a7c-93e3-ad1b5569820e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Farmers take part in a protest outside the Greek parliament against government tax policies in central Athens.

However, there are signs that the pace of improvement in the jobs market is slowing down. Although youth unemployment has fallen, the jobless level among 16-24 years olds still stands at 917,000, which is far too high. Many people are also still working part-time, as they are unable to gain full-time employment.</p> <p>The marginal increase in average earnings growth shows that the gap between inflation and wages is narrowing. But amid the clamour for wage increases, it is important to remember that this must be accompanied by a significant boost in productivity. The recovery is still fragile, and to place it on a sound footing the Chancellor should use next month\u2019s Budget to introduce further measures to boost growth and ensure that it is not choked off.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>J</strong><strong>ohn Allan, National Chairman, Federation of Small Businesses:</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These figures suggest the labour market is continuing to head in the right direction albeit not at the pace we would like. It is important that the momentum of previous quarters is maintained and this can only be achieved by maximising the job creation potential of small businesses.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also encouraging that the gap between pay growth and the rate of inflation is starting to close. If inflation remains low workers can look forward to seeing their pay packet go a little further.

Overall, the trend is still one of an improving jobs market, but the Bank of England will be keen to emphasise that any further improvements will materialise more slowly than they have in recent months, the closer we get to the long run average of 6.5%.</p> <p>Productivity will increase as more people are put into work and therefore the need for new workers diminishes. </p> <p>We believe that yesterday\u2019s inflation number \u2013 the lowest since November 2009 \u2013 alongside this jobs figure should be enough to loosen any near term rate hike expectations.</p> <p>We should all still expect to see rate hikes beginning in Q2 of 2015 and no sooner.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight</b>, thinks the overall tone of the latest labour market report is less buoyant than in recent months, and another sign that interest rates will remain on hold.<br></p> <blockquote> <p>This is not evident just in the fact that the unemployment rate rose back up to 7.2% in the three months to December after falling markedly in recent months to a low of 7.1% in the three months to November, but also in a small fall in employment in the latest month and a recent moderation in the drop in claimant count unemployment...</p> <p>A positive interpretation of the latest data is that it could be an early sign that productivity is finally starting to pick up with more companies making increasing use of their existing workers rather than taking on new workers. This would be highly welcome news for the economy\u2019s longer-term growth prospects....</p> <p>The rise in the unemployment rate to 7.2% in the three months to December supports the Bank of England\u2019s view that interest rates do not need to rise for some time to come. </p> </blockquote> <p><b><i> </i></b></p> <p><b><i> </i></b></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-19T10:53:12.022Z\">at 10.53am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53047a5ee4b0911693db6c6a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-19T09:59:42.989Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a round-up of some of the best early reaction and observation from Twitter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/436070441736613888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Unemployment rate up to 7.2% - widely predicted to hit 7.0%.

And on that note, we\u2019ll close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Meanwhile, back with the US economy: The International Monetary Fund has urged the European Central Bank to consider cutting interest rates to below zero as it warned that deflation in the euro zone was a key new risk facing the world economy. The IMF has published an assessment of global prospects ahead of the meeting of G20 finance ministers in Sydney, and reckons the recovery from recession has been disappointingly weak. Larry Elliott writes: The IMF ...urged stronger co-operation between developed and developing countries to promote growth and financail stability. \u201cA new risk stems from very low inflation in the euro area, where long-term inflation expectations might drift down, raising deflation risks in the event of a serious adverse shock to activity\u201d, the Fund said. It added that the euro area was \u201cturning the corner\u201d from recession to a recovery that was uneven and fragile. Low inflation added to the problems of the troubled countries on the fringes of the euro zone, where low inflation would increase the real burden of already high levels of public debt. \u201cIn the euro area, more monetary easing is needed to raise the prospects of achieving the ECB\u2019s inflation objective, including by supporting demand, given the weak and fragile growth, large output gaps and very low inflation\u201d, said the Washington-based IMF. It said further action could include cheap loan schemes, possibly targeted at small and medium sized firms, and \u201cfurther rate cuts, including mildly negative deposit rates, to support demand and reduce fragmentation\u201d The Fund urged the US to consult with other members of the G20 - a group of leading advanced and emerging nations - about its plans to withdraw gradually the stimulus provided to the American economy. \u201cConcerns about the withdrawal of unconventional monetary policy (the bond buying programme known as quantitative easing) in the US have already provoked sharp price movements in emerging markets\u201d, the Fund said. It added that the return to normal conditions would lead to capital flowing out of emerging markets, \u201cwith risks of lower investment and, potentially, financial disruptions, notably in those with domestic weaknesses.\u201d The summary of the IMF report is here with a link to the full text: IMF Note on Global Prospects and Policy Challenges The US Federal Reserve will probably be able to continue its path of steadily reducing its monthly bond buying programme, according to James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed. Despite recent weak data - notably from the housing market - which has been blamed mainly on the severe weather, he said the US economy was getting back to normal. The comments came in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, which said: Mr. Bullard said the recent decline in the jobless rate is real, downplaying concerns that it is partly driven by a decline in the number of Americans in the labor force. \u201cThe bottom line is then you should take the signal from the unemployment rate decline as a signal of an improving labor market and an improving economy,\u201d Mr. Bullard said. Mr. Bullard, who has expressed concern about low inflation, says he expects it to return to the central bank\u2019s official 2% target. \u201cThe main factor driving inflation is inflation expectations. Those have remained relatively well-anchored up to now and that\u2019s why my forecast for inflation is that it will go back to target,\u201d he said. However, he added that further declines in key inflation measures, currently hovering around 1%, would put pressure on Fed officials to take some sort of policy action to drive it higher. Mr. Bullard is forecasting the U.S. economy will grow 3% or more this year, bolstered by the fading drag from tight fiscal policy from Washington. \u201cThe economy is much closer than normal than what we\u2019re used to thinking about over the last five years,\u201d Mr. Bullard said. As for a recent batch of bad data: \u201cMy gut instinct is that weather has been an important factor during this period,\u201d he said. The rosier backdrop raises the bar for any pause in the Fed\u2019s steady reduction in bond buys. \u201cIt would be a powerful signal if we decided to deviate from our taper,\u201d Mr. Bullard said. Full report here: Fed\u2019s Bullard sees steady taper The Portuguese economy may have turned the corner, the IMF said in its latest report on the country. Here is the summary: There is no doubt that Portugal has made remarkable progress over the past three years. When the sovereign lost access to international bond markets in 2011, the outlook was grim. The economy was facing large domestic and external imbalances and dismal growth prospects. Unprecedented official financing from Portugal\u2019s European partners and the IMF provided a window of opportunity to address the weaknesses at the root of the crisis and regain market confidence. While constrained by formal and informal strictures, the authorities rose to the occasion. The authorities have made substantial progress in fiscal adjustment, while needing to frontload it in view of the high debt burden and to establish fiscal policy credibility. However, it is important to recognize that fiscal targets were relaxed when it was possible to do so, to avoid more severe consequences on growth. All told, about two-thirds of the structural fiscal effort necessary to comply with the European Fiscal Compact\u2019s medium-term objectives has now been completed. Equally important, wide-ranging structural reforms were enacted in spite of difficult socio-economic circumstances and legal hurdles. The government took steps to improve the functioning of the labor and product markets and make the business environment more conducive to growth. External adjustment has exceeded expectations implying a lower need to borrow from overseas; and financial stability has been preserved. The economy now shows early signs that it may have turned the corner. In light of the progress on all of these fronts, foreign bond market investors seem reassured, and sovereign yields recently dipped to their lowest level since April 2010. Meanwhile more protests are taking place in Athens today: Some good news from Greece, which last year recorded its first current account surplus since 1948, when official data began, thanks to record spending by tourists. Spending by foreigners was boosted by the Greek tourism industry\u2019s decision to cut prices dramatically. Reuters reports: Current account deficits have been a drag on the Greek economy for decades, offset with borrowing and capital investment from abroad. The payments gap swelled to 15 percent of national output in 2008 after the country entered the eurozone, fed by a debt-fuelled economic boom that led to a consumption frenzy on foreign imports. But the ensuing debt crisis in 2009 plunged the country into an economic depression that shrank its economy by almost a quarter, helping Athens correct the imbalance and leading to a current account surplus of \u20ac1.24bn last year, or about 0.7% of gross domestic product. Tourism receipts, the country\u2019s biggest foreign-currency earner, rose 15% to a record \u20ac12bn, while imports shrank. Full report here: Tourism boom drives Greece to first current account surplus on record A(nother) spat has broken out between the UK government and the Scottish National Party over what would happen to Scotland\u2019s share of the national debt in the event of independence. The war of words kicked off after Scotland\u2019s first minister Alex Salmond recently warned that Scotland might not shoulder its share of the national debt if England refused to share the pound. Now, Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, has got in the government\u2019s response, arguing that abandoning Scotland\u2019s share of the UK\u2019s national debt would send borrowing costs soaring. In the event of a default, of a refusal to accept debt, one bank, Jeffries investment bank, has done the only detailed estimate out there - they have suggested that under those circumstances there would be a premium of more like five percentage points in that default scenario. If you run that through the calculator in terms of how that gets passed on to the real economy... it would have a huge effect on mortgages and businesses. Assuming a 75% pass through from bond rates to mortgage rates would be an extra cost of about \u00a35,200 on an average mortgage cost in Scotland. The idea that you would start your life as a new nation state like that would be cutting off your nose to spite your face. A spokesman for Scottish finance minister John Swinney accused the UK government of scare stories. Danny Alexander is talking nonsense, and this is another of the ridiculous, overblown and transparent scare stories that are doing such damage to the No campaign. For a start, our policy is that an independent Scotland should agree to finance a fair share of debt which will remain legally that of the Westminster Treasury - as they themselves confirmed last month - on the basis that Scotland gets a fair share of both assets and liabilities. The Treasury has accepted all the debt will be legally theirs because of Westminster\u2019s argument that the rest of the UK will be the continuing state - so by definition it is impossible to default on a debt that is not legally yours. So that\u2019s settled then... or not This follows Treasury proposals released today for Scotland to issue its own bonds. Quotes from PA. With that, I am handing over the blog to Nick Fletcher. Thank you for following so far. So far, no reaction on US markets to the disappointing housing starts data, but analysts think investors are playing safe ahead of minutes due later today from the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent policy meeting. Dow Jones +0.03% at 16,136 points Nasdaq-0.09% at 4,268 points Alarm bells over the US housing market are ringing, as US housing starts tumbled, recording their biggest monthly drop for almost three years. The number of new homes started in January was 880,000 units, a 16% fall on the previous month, according to the commerce department. Economists polled by Reuters had expected starts to fall to 950,000 in January. The unseasonably cold weather has made house builders less likely to break new ground, but analysts suspect deeper structural factors are in play. Teunis Brosens at ING described the fall in housing starts as \u201ca steep correction\u201d on previous months, with the weather offering only a partial explanation. Bad weather cannot be all of the answer. Homebuilders have also become less optimistic about prospects for the coming six months. Moreover, mortgage applications for house purchases, published by the MBA earlier today, show a further decline. Applications are hovering some 15% below levels a year ago. It seems that higher mortgage rates, induced by the Fed\u2019s tapering, are also taking their toll on the housing market. We will get a clearer picture of the true state of the housing market once the snow has melted. Renzi seems to be enjoying the drama of forming a government. In a tweet that has already been retweeted hundreds of times, he said laid into populist Beppe Grillo\u2019s five-star party. Very rough translation I\u2019m so sorry for those who voted 5 stars. You deserve more, my friends. But I promise you that we will change Italy, even for you. A quick update on Italy, where Matteo Renzi has said he expects to formally take on the role of prime minister on Saturday. He has promised to ask parliament for a confidence vote in his new government on Monday. Speaking after inter-party talks on forming a government, Renzi said: I\u2019m convinced that the conditions are in place to do good work. Via Reuters. Just in: the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has confirmed it has scaled back its work with the Ukrainian government, since the conflict erupted between authoritarian ruler Viktor Yanukovych and anti-government protesters. The EBRD said it had not plans to pull out of the country despite the spiralling unrest that has led to at least 26 deaths. We have not suspended our operations in Ukraine, however, as of about three weeks ago, we are concentrating primarily on the private sector.\ufeff Here is a snapshot of the changing jobs picture across the country. The regions with the largest decrease in the unemployment rate were the Midlands, recording a 1.3 percentage point fall, followed by Wales and Scotland, a 0.9 percentage point fall. Only one region in Britain showed an increase in the unemployment rate: the South West saw joblessness rise by 0.5 percentage points. Update: it also tells a familiar story of jobs concentrated in the south east. Unemployment is lowest in the southeast of England: 5.3% and highest in the north east: 10.3%. This table does not show Northern Ireland, one of the worst-hit regions for unemployment during the recession, and where the joblessness rate stands at 7.4%, above the national average. Henry McDonald, the Guardian\u2019s Ireland correspondent, reports that the region\u2019s economy has received a boost from mobile phone company EE. Mobile phone company EE has announced it is creating 250 new jobs to Northern Ireland today. It is part of EE\u2019s plans to expand its workforce by 1000 bringing its operation from overseas back to the UK. The firm has said it will be operating in the region within the next few months. However, it is not yet clear where exactly in Northern Ireland the firm will be operating from or if staff will be hired via an existing call centre operator. The Bank of England\u2019s Paul Fisher has said the latest unemployment figures confirm the broader trend of falling joblessness. Speaking on the World at One, he also said it was a shame there were no women on the committee that sets UK interest rates. Asked about soaring house prices, Fisher said the level of housing transactions was normal. The latest unemployment figures are a bit of a puzzle. As readers of this blog have pointed out, the headline figures don\u2019t seem to add up. In the final three months of 2013, the number of people classified as jobless fell by 125,000, but the unemployment rate edged up from 7.1% in November to 7.2% in December. The ONS has said the data series is not intended to record monthly changes. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, has written this guide to the mixed bag of statistics. What is clear is that the really rapid jobs growth seen in the early autumn moderated as the year came to an end. But surveys of the labour market and the more up to date (if less comprehensive) claimant count measure both point to unemployment continuing to decline in early 2014. Why is the improvement less marked? There are three possible explanations. The first is that the labour force is being increased by those who were formerly classed as inactive but have been encouraged to look for work by the fall in unemployment in the second half of 2013. Jobs are still being created but there are more people looking for them; hence unemployment is coming down more slowly. Read the full version here. In Rome negotiations on forming a new government continue today and our friends on Twitter tell us prime minister designate Matteo Renzi will meet disgraced ex-PM Silvio Berlusconi. On Tuesday Renzi met centre-right party (NCD) leader Angelino Alfano. Alfano is pictured here at the sumptuous Montecitorio Palace talking to the media. Corriere della Sera says that a new government will be announced on Saturday. Meanwhile, the European Commission has warned Renzi it will not look kindly on attempts to evade EU budget rules. The Financial Times (metered paywall) reports that the Commission wants Italy to stick to a deficit limit of 3% of economic output and stay the course to pay down Italy\u2019s \u20ac2,000bn public debt. Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic affairs, gave short shrift to Renzi\u2019s suggestion that Italy could override the EU\u2019s stability and growth pact. His response, in the most diplomatic Brussels speak: I trust Italy and the Italian authorities will continue to stay committed to the European treaties, and that covers the stability and growth pact. We all know Italy has a very high level of public debt, and piling new debt on top of this old debt does not seem to improve the economic competitiveness of Italy. Renzi may lack a popular mandate, but his call to go beyond \u201causterity as religion\u201d could resonate with voters.\ufeff Here is the link to our unemployment story: Unemployment continues to fall with record numbers of women in work The UK is suffering a productivity hangover slowing down job creation, according to labour market experts at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. And the latest ONS data shows the productivity headache is not over yet, with output per hour fall 0.3% in the last quarter. Gerwyn Davies, the CIPD\u2019s labour market adviser, said: Worryingly, the latest quarterly figures show that output per hour fell by 0.3%.This reflects the fact that the UK economy continues to suffer from a productivity hangover that is still hampering businesses\u2019 efforts to become more competitive. A CIPD survey of 935 employers shows that the number planning to recruit has fallen to its lowest level in years. Recruitment intentions have slowed while one in five employers are planning redundancies. Davies also points out that wages are at a standstill, with the self-employed hardest hit. Overall, while the immediate jobs outlook remains relatively bright, it looks as though the vast majority of workers will at best experience a standstill in real earnings, with the greatest challenges being faced by the rapidly growing number of self-employed people. As various studies have shown, average earnings for the self-employed have suffered a substantial fall since the recession and a striking point about the latest figures is that roughly three-quarters of the quarterly increase in employment is made up of self-employed. Amid all the head-scratching over the unemployment data, let\u2019s not overlook the latest minutes from the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. They show that the MPC stood full-square behind governor Mark Carney in the decision to update the bank\u2019s forward guidance policy. Forward guidance II, quickly dubbed fuzzy guidance, means the bank will only raise interest rates if a broader range of factors, such as the output gap, show an improvement. The first version of forward guidance had tied interest rates to unemployment, but this became out of date when the jobless rate fell much faster than the bank had expected. The MPC said employment gains had been strong, but pointed to the spare capacity in the economy - those people in part-time jobs who would prefer to work longer. Employment gains had been exceptionally strong and unemployment had fallen more rapidly than expected. The unemployment rate had fallen to 7.1% in the three months to November, and data to be released in the next few months were likely to show it reaching the Committee\u2019s 7% threshold. Even so, the Committee judged that a degree of spare capacity remained, concentrated in the labour market. The bank also noted that the risks in the global economy were shifting away from advanced economies to emerging ones, with declining momentum from China. Among the emerging economies, the recent market volatility had been most pronounced for those countries facing idiosyncratic, and often political, uncertainty; there had been little sign yet of generalised contagion. Read the minutes here. Business groups have welcomed the fall in unemployment, but questioned the speed of the recovery. Citing \u201cthe fragile recovery\u201d, the British Chamber of Commerce has stepped up its calls for measures to boost growth from next month\u2019s budgets. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce: These figures show that we have a strong and flexible labour market in the UK, with unemployment falling and employment rising. However, there are signs that the pace of improvement in the jobs market is slowing down. Although youth unemployment has fallen, the jobless level among 16-24 years olds still stands at 917,000, which is far too high. Many people are also still working part-time, as they are unable to gain full-time employment. The marginal increase in average earnings growth shows that the gap between inflation and wages is narrowing. But amid the clamour for wage increases, it is important to remember that this must be accompanied by a significant boost in productivity. The recovery is still fragile, and to place it on a sound footing the Chancellor should use next month\u2019s Budget to introduce further measures to boost growth and ensure that it is not choked off. John Allan, National Chairman, Federation of Small Businesses: These figures suggest the labour market is continuing to head in the right direction albeit not at the pace we would like. It is important that the momentum of previous quarters is maintained and this can only be achieved by maximising the job creation potential of small businesses. \u201cIt is also encouraging that the gap between pay growth and the rate of inflation is starting to close. If inflation remains low workers can look forward to seeing their pay packet go a little further. Our members are telling us they are beginning to raise staff pay so hopefully this is a trend which will continue. Another round-up of the best charts and observations on unemployment from Twitter: The unemployment rate for young people has fallen slightly, with 637,000 people aged 16-24 not in education, work or training, in the final three months of the year, a fall of 27,000 from July to September 2013. Charles Levy, senior economist at The Work Foundation, points out that unemployment went up for 16 or 17 year olds. While there is a big drop in youth unemployment, it increased slightly among 16 and 17 year olds emphasising wider unanswered structural problems. This comes as a survey shows that 85% of teens believe that unfair media stereotypes are holding them back in the labour market.\ufeff Levy also highlights the large numbers of people working part time, who would prefer a full-time job. Underemployment remains a problem with 1.4 million individuals working part-time. The jump in self-employment is also of concern since self-employment is dominated by low-wage work. If our recovery is to be sustained, the attention must now shift onto supporting those on the edge of our labour market. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady welcomes the fall in unemployment, but thinks the UK has a long way to go to close the living-standards and gender-pay gaps. These are encouraging figures for the millions of people desperate for work. It is good news that unemployment levels continue to fall, and that young people are finally beginning to share in the improving jobs market. But people already in work have less to cheer about, with prices still rising twice as fast as wages. While we have a record proportion of women in employment, the widening gender pay gap means many women are not getting the fair pay they deserve. Jobless levels are falling but there\u2019s a long way to go before we see the rates of pay and employment enjoyed before the recession. In Labour\u2019s response to the unemployment data, Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary, highlights the problem of long-term unemployment. While today\u2019s fall in overall unemployment is welcome, the government must not be complacent. More than 900,000 young people are still unemployed and over 250,000 young people have been unemployed for over a year. Today\u2018s figures also show working people facing a cost-of-living crisis are over \u00a31,600 a year worse off since David Cameron\u2019s became Prime Minister. Nick Palmer, the ONS\u2019s senior labour market statistician, has issued a cautionary statement on how to interpret the latest batch of statistics. The unemployment rate is 7.2%, but he says this is not directly comparable with the previous figure of 7.1%. The latest unemployment rate is 7.2%, down 0.4 on the previous quarter. This is a comparison between the July-September and October-December three-month periods. It is higher than last month\u2019s published figure of 7.1% for September-November. However, it is not directly comparable with the figure published this month, as the Labour Force Survey is not designed to measure monthly changes. The main conclusion that should be drawn from these latest figures is that the rate at which unemployment has been falling is likely to have slowed down. One last chart, for now. The ONS report that employment rose by 193,000 in the three months to December 2013, with 30.15m people in work. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight has pointed out this puts the UK slightly down on the record employment level seen last year. This is an interesting picture of the long-term shift in the UK labour market: a fall in the number of women out of the labour market and a rise in the number of men. The title, which has been cut off in the screen grab, is \u201c% of men and women not in the labour force\u201d. 10.44 update: more women are in work than at any time since 1971, just over 14 million. A total of 1.4 m people are in part-time jobs because they cannot find full-time work, a fall of 29,000 over the latest quarter but 46,000 higher than a year ago. Here is a handy infographic from the ONS telling us how many people are in the UK labour market - in total and as a proportion of the working-age population. Here is how economists have reacted to the latest employment data: John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist, says unemployment is on track to fall below 7%, despite the statistical oddities. Today\u2019s jobless figures proved to be one of those occasional statistical oddities that arise because of the way the ONS measures the headline unemployment number. The unemployment rate fell sharply from 7.6% to 7.2% in the three months to December 2013 when compared with the three months to September but the headline rate was slightly higher than the figure of 7.1% published in January which was based on a comparison of the three months to September with the three months to June. But putting the statistical quirks to one side, the underlying trend in unemployment is firmly downward and the headline rate remains well on track to fall below 7% in the coming months. Falling unemployment and a rise in job vacancies is now aiding all categories of jobseekers, including young people and the long-term unemployed, while the problem of underemployment is also starting to ease slightly... Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said the upwards move was s a surprise, but the overall trend is getting better. For every action there must be a reaction and this is it. Overall, the trend is still one of an improving jobs market, but the Bank of England will be keen to emphasise that any further improvements will materialise more slowly than they have in recent months, the closer we get to the long run average of 6.5%. Productivity will increase as more people are put into work and therefore the need for new workers diminishes. We believe that yesterday\u2019s inflation number \u2013 the lowest since November 2009 \u2013 alongside this jobs figure should be enough to loosen any near term rate hike expectations. We should all still expect to see rate hikes beginning in Q2 of 2015 and no sooner. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, thinks the overall tone of the latest labour market report is less buoyant than in recent months, and another sign that interest rates will remain on hold. This is not evident just in the fact that the unemployment rate rose back up to 7.2% in the three months to December after falling markedly in recent months to a low of 7.1% in the three months to November, but also in a small fall in employment in the latest month and a recent moderation in the drop in claimant count unemployment... A positive interpretation of the latest data is that it could be an early sign that productivity is finally starting to pick up with more companies making increasing use of their existing workers rather than taking on new workers. This would be highly welcome news for the economy\u2019s longer-term growth prospects.... The rise in the unemployment rate to 7.2% in the three months to December supports the Bank of England\u2019s view that interest rates do not need to rise for some time to come. Here is a round-up of some of the best early reaction and observation from Twitter. More to follow... Prime minister David Cameron has welcome the fall in unemployment. Esther McVey, employment minister, has said it shows the government\u2019s plan is working. With employment continuing to increase, it\u2019s clear that the government\u2019s long-term plan to build a stronger, more secure economy is helping businesses create jobs and get people into work. Record numbers of women are in work and youth unemployment continues to fall, which means more people have the security of a regular wage and can plan for their future. Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, thinks the Lib Dems deserves the credit. This recovery wouldn\u2019t be happening without the Liberal Democrats in Government. Quarter by quarter, job by job, we are rebuilding Britain\u2019s economy. Every job created is a family helped and a boost to our economic growth. This, combined with the encouraging news on inflation earlier this week, is further convincing evidence that our long-term economic plan is working. Rebuilding the economy, boosting employment, securing growth and controlling inflation are the only ways to secure living standards for the future. The unemployment rate has risen slightly to 7.2% for the final three months of 2013, compared to the previous decline of 7.1%, although the number of people out of work fell by 125,000. As economists have pointed out, the rate could be a statistical quirk, but the opposition will raise questions about the speed of the recovery. Here are some headlines from the ONS stats: available here. Unemployment fell by 125,000 between October and December to 2.34 m. The benefit claimant count has fallen by 27,600 to 1.22m. Average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rise 1.1% in three months to the end of the year. A total of 2.34 m were out of work, a fall of 125,000 compared to July to September 2013. Also from the Bank of England minutes: Governor Mark Carney did not ask MPC to vote on changes to his forward guidance policy. MPC vote 9.0 to keep bond buying steady. Breaking news: the UK unemployment rate rises to 7.2% The Russian rouble has fallen to record lows this morning, after the finance ministry announced it would buy nearly $6bn in foreign currency, decreasing its own interventions in the market. The rouble is at an all time-low against the euro (1=49 r) and the dollar (1=36 r). Analysts say the violence in Ukraine is not to blame, with the currency being driven down by the ministry plan. Scotland will be allowed to raise debt in its own name, according to new proposals from the UK Treasury intended to show that Scotland can thrive as part of the UK. But the deal to allow Scotland to issue bonds comes at a price. Scotland might have to pay 0.3-1.2% more than the UK government to borrow from financial markets, according to a finance ministry report cited by Reuters. George Osborne, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, who last week turned down a currency union with an independent Scotland, said it was a historic day. Being able to issue its own bonds gives Scotland new powers and new responsibility, within the security of the UK. Alongside the considerable new tax and spending powers we have already given ... it is further evidence of why being part of the UK gives Scotland the best of both worlds. No surprises, but the Scottish National Party government said nothing short of independence would do. The SNP Government said the move as \u201ctoo little too late\u201d, adding that full sovereignty was needed. Instead of having the powers to borrow that were needed during the recession, the UK Government is instead responsible for 26% cuts in capital spending. This is simply too little too late. Quotes via Reuters and The Herald. But what will these Scottish bonds be called: kilts ? European stock markets are calm, as investors take a breather after a run of good results. The FTSE has nudged up a bit after an early drop, while Spain and Italy are slightly down. UK FTSE100 +0.11% at 6804 points Germany\u2019s DAX -0.09% at 9,651 points France\u2019s CAC40 -0.03% at 4, 329 points Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB -0.2% at 20,438 points Spain\u2019s IBEX -0.23% at 10,019 points Japan\u2019s Nikkei index closed down 0.5% at 14, 766 points. Market watchers attribute the fall on profit taking as investors sought to cash in shares in banks and big exporters after a rally on Tuesday that sent the index up more than 3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Today we have more evidence that a surge in jobs has failed to reduce reliance on part-time work and this trend is set to continue despite the recovery. The report from the Jobs Economist finds that around one in five employees now work in \u201cmini jobs\u201d of between 16 and 20 hours a week. The report comes just ahead of official data expected to show UK unemployment held steady at 7.1%. John Philpott of the Jobs Economist said: A sustained economic recovery is likely to see a much faster rate of full-time job creation and help reduce under-employment, but it would be wrong to assume that this will reverse the long-run trend towards shorter working hours. Although the UK continues to be characterised as having an ingrained long hours work culture, the reality has been an ongoing structural shift towards a shorter hours work culture which is likely to continue even in better economic times. Insofar as the trend toward mini-jobs indicates that more people are able to strike a better work-life balance it may be viewed as a positive development, although those for whom a mini-job also means a mini weekly income might take a less rosy view of our emerging employment landscape. The Office for National Statistics figures on unemployment, due at 9.30, will also reveal more clues on the cost of living. The consensus view is that average earnings grew by 0.9% in the final quarter of 2013, while overall unemployment is expected to be steady at 7.1%. But Michael Hewson of CMC Markets thinks economists could be in for a surprise on the rate. Expectations for December are for the unemployment level to remain unchanged at 7.1%, but in my opinion there is a risk we could see the unemployment rate increase slightly. It was only in October that the rate was at 7.7% and unemployment levels never fall in a straight line. On Tuesday we found out that UK inflation has fallen to its lowest in four years, but as Hewson points out it is only good news if average earnings are going in the opposite direction. This is also a day for central bank watchers, with the Bank of England is due to publish the minutes of their most recent monetary policy discussions this morning, and the US Federal Reserve to follow. I\u2019ll be tracking that and all the latest...",

      "standfirst": "Motor racing fan Justin King is stepping down from the retailer in July, fuelling speculation he could take over the F1 top job", 
      "body": "<p>Bernie Ecclestone has denied rumours that Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King will replace him as Formula One boss, claiming that the retailer's knowledge of the sport is limited to supporting his son's ambition to join the F1 starting grid.</p> <p>King announced last month that he would step down as head of Sainsbury's in July after a decade in the post. It fuelled speculation that he could replace Ecclestone, who is 83 and stood down from the board of F1 in January after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/16/bernie-ecclestone-trial-bribery-german-f1\" title=\"\">being told that he faces bribery charges in Germany</a>.</p> <p>King is known to be a motor racing fan and his son Jordan is a professional driver. Last year Jordan won British Formula 3, a junior series which is two steps below F1. Speaking for the first time since King announced his resignation, Ecclestone says there is \"no truth at all\" to the rumour that he will be taking over F1's driving seat. Asked what the Sainsbury's boss knows about running a motorsport series, Ecclestone said: \"All he knows about is looking for support for his kids.\"</p> <p>It is a reference to a controversy in 2012 when it came to light that five brands with business ties to Sainsbury's sponsor his son's racing career. Sainsbury's said that its board had approved the arrangements and that there was \"no conflict of interest\" because King had no direct involvement with the brands' commercial relationships.</p> <p>Mr King's interest in racing has also driven talk about him taking over as chief executive of the McLaren F1 team. He is a close friend of its chairman Ron Dennis and the two go on shooting trips together. Dennis recently created the chief executive post but a spokesperson for McLaren said it was \"untrue\" that King would fill the role.</p> <p>This month King was asked by London radio station LBC whether he would be interested in a role in motor racing. He replied: \"I'm more focused on my son's ambitions to get to Formula One \u2013 it would make me very proud and I'd get a lot of pleasure if he achieved that.\" A spokesperson for Mr King declined to comment further.</p> <p>Speaking last month in the wake of his resignation announcement, 52-year old King said he still had \"plenty more in the tank\" for another big job, but added that he had not been talking to other organisations. A non-compete clause in his contract means he cannot work for another supermarket, or former employer Marks &amp; Spencer, until at least July 2015. King is also an elder statesman of the business world, as senior figure at the CBI and a former member of David Cameron's business advisory group.</p> <p>Ecclestone has not groomed a successor despite facing possible threats to his position. In April he is due to be put on trial in Munich for allegedly paying part of a $44m (\u00a326.3m) bribe to steer the sale of F1 to the private equity firm CVC in 2006. He denies the charges against him and although the German legal system allows the case to be settled by making a financial payment, he insists that he \"wants to be there to clear his name. I bet it is going to happen.\"</p> <p>Despite stepping down from the F1 board, Mr Ecclestone continues to run F1 on a day-to-day basis and CVC has given him its full support. The only sign of succession planning so far has been its hiring of head hunting firm Egon Zehnder as part of the stalled plan to float F1 on the Singapore stock exchange in 2012. Egon Zehnder drafted a confidential shortlist of potential replacements for Ecclestone, which reportedly includes Premier League boss Richard Scudamore. However no one has been engaged.</p> <p>Ecclestone says he is already looking to his next challenge which is to deal with the Olden, his 16-room hotel in the Swiss ski resort of Gstaad. He recently bought out his business partner, former Ferrari team boss Marco Piccinini, and he is understood to have spent the past few days at the hotel. \"I'm going to try to sort my hotel out,\" says Mr Ecclestone \"I have bought the other people out so I have now got the aggravation from that too.\"</p>",

It fuelled speculation that he could replace Ecclestone, who is 83 and stood down from the board of F1 in January after being told that he faces bribery charges in Germany. King is known to be a motor racing fan and his son Jordan is a professional driver. Last year Jordan won British Formula 3, a junior series which is two steps below F1. Speaking for the first time since King announced his resignation, Ecclestone says there is \"no truth at all\" to the rumour that he will be taking over F1's driving seat. Asked what the Sainsbury's boss knows about running a motorsport series, Ecclestone said: \"All he knows about is looking for support for his kids.\" It is a reference to a controversy in 2012 when it came to light that five brands with business ties to Sainsbury's sponsor his son's racing career. Sainsbury's said that its board had approved the arrangements and that there was \"no conflict of interest\" because King had no direct involvement with the brands' commercial relationships. Mr King's interest in racing has also driven talk about him taking over as chief executive of the McLaren F1 team. He is a close friend of its chairman Ron Dennis and the two go on shooting trips together. Dennis recently created the chief executive post but a spokesperson for McLaren said it was \"untrue\" that King would fill the role. This month King was asked by London radio station LBC whether he would be interested in a role in motor racing. He replied: \"I'm more focused on my son's ambitions to get to Formula One \u2013 it would make me very proud and I'd get a lot of pleasure if he achieved that.\" A spokesperson for Mr King declined to comment further. Speaking last month in the wake of his resignation announcement, 52-year old King said he still had \"plenty more in the tank\" for another big job, but added that he had not been talking to other organisations. A non-compete clause in his contract means he cannot work for another supermarket, or former employer Marks &amp; Spencer, until at least July 2015. King is also an elder statesman of the business world, as senior figure at the CBI and a former member of David Cameron's business advisory group. Ecclestone has not groomed a successor despite facing possible threats to his position. In April he is due to be put on trial in Munich for allegedly paying part of a $44m (\u00a326.3m) bribe to steer the sale of F1 to the private equity firm CVC in 2006. He denies the charges against him and although the German legal system allows the case to be settled by making a financial payment, he insists that he \"wants to be there to clear his name. I bet it is going to happen.\" Despite stepping down from the F1 board, Mr Ecclestone continues to run F1 on a day-to-day basis and CVC has given him its full support. The only sign of succession planning so far has been its hiring of head hunting firm Egon Zehnder as part of the stalled plan to float F1 on the Singapore stock exchange in 2012. Egon Zehnder drafted a confidential shortlist of potential replacements for Ecclestone, which reportedly includes Premier League boss Richard Scudamore. However no one has been engaged. Ecclestone says he is already looking to his next challenge which is to deal with the Olden, his 16-room hotel in the Swiss ski resort of Gstaad. He recently bought out his business partner, former Ferrari team boss Marco Piccinini, and he is understood to have spent the past few days at the hotel. \"I'm going to try to sort my hotel out,\" says Mr Ecclestone \"I have bought the other people out so I have now got the aggravation from that too.\"",

      "bodyText": "Pets at Home opened up the retail stock market rush to members of the public yesterday as it said small investors and employees could buy into its \u00a31.2bn flotation on the London Stock Exchange. About 500 senior employees, from chief executive Nick Wood down to some store managers, already own 10% of the company, potentially handing them a \u00a3120m windfall when the company joins the public markets next month. But all employees will be offered the chance to apply for guaranteed parcels of shares worth between \u00a3250 and \u00a3750 giving them rights ahead of institutional investors. Pet-loving members of the public will also be able to apply for shares worth a minimum of \u00a31,000 each. \"We believe it's important to have as wide a shareholder base as possible. Our colleagues and customers love Pets at Home and have a common bond, an emotional bond with our business,\" said Wood, who took over from Matt Davies, who now runs Halfords, in 2012. The former American Golf boss, whose twin daughters own twin Bichon Fris\u00e9 dogs Oscar and Louis, said Pets at Home's 6,000 employees own 23,000 pets between them. \"That gives you a feel for how much we love pets,\" he said. Britain's biggest pet retailer with 369 stores, 246 vet surgeries and 116 in-store grooming salons is the fifth retailer to announce plans to join the stock market so far this year with another 10 possibly in the pipeline. Convenience store group McColl's was the first to confirm its plans and is expected to announce its pricing level next week. Online kitchen appliance store AO, discounter Poundland and Russian hypermarket group Lenta are all launching onto the stock market within weeks while fashion e-tailer Boohoo.com is expected to confirm its plans for an initial public offer (IPO) as early as next week. Discounters B&amp;M and Card Factory as well as department store House of Fraser, Fashion retailer Fat Face and Indian fashion e-tailer Koovs are also attempting to put together stock market listings. Pets at Home, which is majority-owned by US private equity firm KKR, will seek to raise \u00a3275m from issuing new shares in order to pay down debt so that it will join the market with net debt of the same amount. That debt takes its total enterprise value to \u00a31.5bn. Investors have been nervous about private equity-backed companies given the poor performance of previous debt-heavy companies such as Debenhams. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \"Pets is a great business, but it will be seen as an important test of investor appetite for private equity owned retailers, as it has been through a couple of owners in recent years, so the question is 'how much has been left in the tank by KKR?'\" KKR bought its majority stake in Pets at Home from fellow private equity firm Bridgepoint four years ago when the business was valued at at \u00a3955m. It is expected to reap a healthy profit when it sell down part of its stake in the flotation. Wood shrugged off suggestions that Pets had been squeezed for profits by its backers, saying \u00a3120m had been invested in the business in the four years since KKR had held the keys. \"If you look at KKR's investment history in our business it has been significant,\" he said. \"I think we have got a unique story and a unique growth opportunity that every investor needs to look at. That opportunity is about store growth and growth of services such as vets and pet groomers.\" The retailer, which was founded in 1991, is aiming to open 131 stores, more than 400 more vets surgeries and nearly 200 more grooming parlours as it takes advantage of Brits' increasing desire to pamper their pets. The \u00a35.4bn pet market, including food, accessories and services has grown at a rate of 2.6% a year over the last five years while Pets at Home has grown to take 12% of that market. Pets at Home would be the only listed pet retailer in Europe and its nearest comparable chain would be PetsMart in the US, which is valued at about $6.7bn. In the 40 weeks to January 2, Pets at Home's revenues rose 11%.7% year on year or 2.4% if the benefit of new store openings is stripped out. Underlying earnings also rose 11% to \u00a387m. Bubb said Pets at Home was profitable and cash generative and so likely to pay a good dividend.",

      "bodyText": "UnemploymentThe latest unemployment figures are a bit of a mixed bag. In the final three months of 2013, the number of people classified as jobless fell by 125,000. Even so, the unemployment rate edged up from 7.1% in November to 7.2% in December. So, first things first. This is not the end of the decline in unemployment; it simply means that the rate of improvement slowed towards the end of the year. The reason for that comes down to the way the Office for National Statistics calculates the figures, which is done on a rolling quarterly basis and not designed to pick up monthly changes. In the latest set of data, the three months ending in December are being compared with the three months ending in September; when the last set of figures was released in January 2014, the comparison was between the three months to November 2013 and the three months to August 2013. The comparison is affected by the month that drops out of the rolling quarterly comparison and the new month that enters it. What is clear is that the really rapid jobs growth, seen in the early autumn, moderated as the year came to an end. But surveys of the labour market and the more up-to-date (if less comprehensive) claimant count both point to unemployment continuing to fall in early 2014. Why is the improvement less marked? There are three possible explanations. The first is that the labour force is being increased by those who were formerly classed as inactive but have been encouraged to look for work by the fall in unemployment in the second half of 2013. Jobs are still being created but there are more people looking for them; hence unemployment is coming down more slowly. The second, more tentative, explanation is that Britain is finally seeing a bit of productivity growth, illustrated by the 0.4% increase in total hours worked in the three months to December, which was below the 0.7% rise in national output. Firms are getting more output from their existing workers and as a result don't need to hire so many new employees. The final explanation is that the economy's growth rate softened slightly towards the end of last year and this may have affected hiring. In terms of policy, the unemployment news provides Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and his colleagues with a bit more breathing space in their attempts to keep interest rates pegged at 0.5%. It was not just that the headline jobless rate ticked up to 7.2%, it was that a large chunk of the reported increase in jobs is coming from self-employment and that pay is still running below inflation, despite a marginal increase in earnings growth to 1% in December. The reaction of the City to the news told its own story. Sterling fell because markets believe Threadneedle Street will see the figures as justifying its wait-and-see approach on rates. But the fact that the pound's fall was modest reflected the belief that the months ahead will see further falls in unemployment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Female employment in the UK has reached its highest level since records began, as the overall number of unemployed people fell again at the end of last year. The employment rate among women hit 67.2%, the highest since 1971, according to official data released on Wednesday which showed women now account for 46% of the UK workforce. The latest rise was driven by an increase in the number of women working full time, which was up by 122,000, to 8.1 million, over the past three months. The number with part-time jobs fell, by 28,000, to 5.9 million, while the number of men in both full-time and part-time work rose. Across the wider UK economy there were 2.3 million people out of work in the three months to December, 125,000 fewer than in the three months to September, although the pace of falling unemployment was slowing, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, the latest data showed that the overall unemployment rate increased to 7.2% in the final three months of the year, from 7.1% in the three months to November. But that was lower than the 7.6% rate in the three months to September. Economists described the apparent increase as a statistical quirk relating to the way the ONS measures and compares unemployment. A breakdown of the figures over previous months suggested there was a rise in the number of people out of work in December, but the ONS stressed that monthly figures were volatile and a three-month average was a more representative indicator. Nick Palmer, senior labour market statistician at the ONS, explained: \"The latest unemployment rate is 7.2%, down 0.4 points on the previous quarter. This is a comparison between the July-September and October-December three-month periods. It is higher than last month's published figure of 7.1% for September-November. \"However, it is not directly comparable with the figure published this month, as the labour force survey is not designed to measure monthly changes. The main conclusion that should be drawn from these latest figures is that the rate at which unemployment has been falling is likely to have slowed down.\" The number of people claiming jobless benefits fell by 27,600 between December and January, to 1.22 million. Between January 2013 and January 2014, the number of jobseeker's allowance claimants fell by 327,600, in the largest annual fall in since March 1998. Wages growth accelerated slightly to 1% between October and December, compared with 0.9% a year earlier, adding to hopes that earnings growth will start to outpace inflation by the end of 2014. A breakdown of the data showed that workers in the manufacturing sector, and in wholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants, have already seen a rise in real wages, with earnings growth above the 1.9% inflation rate in those industries. Esther McVey, the employment minister, said the figures showed that \"the government's long-term plan to build a stronger, more secure economy is helping businesses create jobs and get people into work\". Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary, welcomed the overall fall in unemployment, but highlighted the fact that more than 900,000 young people were still unemployed and more than 250,000 young people had been unemployed for over a year. She said: \"Today's figures also show working people facing a cost-of-living crisis are over \u00a31,600 a year worse off since David Cameron became prime minister.\" The Work Foundation said the broad trend of falling unemployment was welcome, but there were groups at the margins who were still suffering. Charles Levy, senior economist at the thinktank, highlighted a rise in unemployment among 16 and 17-year-olds, and other more worrying trends. \"Underemployment remains a problem, with 1.4 million individuals working part-time. \"The jump in self-employment is also of concern since self-employment is dominated by low-wage work. If our recovery is to be sustained, the attention must now shift on to supporting those on the edge of our labour market.\" The slight increase in the jobless rate took even more pressure off Bank of England policymakers to consider an interest rate rise this year after a fall in the annual rate of inflation to 1.9% in December, from 2% in November. Minutes of the February meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC), published on Wednesday, showed all nine members voting in favour of keeping interest rates on hold. Despite the sharper than expected fall in the jobless total in previous months, the MPC said borrowing costs could be kept on hold because inflation was low, the public expected the cost of living to be kept under control, and any threat from the housing market could be dealt with by the Bank's financial policy committee. \"With unemployment remaining above the 7% threshold, the MPC's policy guidance therefore remained in place and no member thought it appropriate to tighten, or to loosen, the stance of monetary policy at this juncture,\" the minutes say.",

If our recovery is to be sustained, the attention must now shift on to supporting those on the edge of our labour market.\"</p> <p>The slight increase in the jobless rate took even more pressure off Bank of England policymakers to consider an interest rate rise this year after a fall in the annual rate of inflation to 1.9% in December, from 2% in November.</p> <p>Minutes of the February meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC), published on Wednesday, showed all nine members voting in favour of keeping interest rates on hold.</p> <p>Despite the sharper than expected fall in the jobless total in previous months, the MPC said borrowing costs could be kept on hold because inflation was low, the public expected the cost of living to be kept under control, and any threat from the housing market could be dealt with by the Bank's financial policy committee.</p> <p>\"With unemployment remaining above the 7% threshold, the MPC's policy guidance therefore remained in place and no member thought it appropriate to tighten, or to loosen, the stance of monetary policy at this juncture,\" the minutes say.</p>",

The company has detailed the payouts, which are due to begin next week and total \u00a349.4bn. Each investor will receive 30p in cash for every share they own, plus 0.026 Verizon Communications shares, worth around 72p at the current price and exchange rate. Provided court approval for the scheme is granted on Friday, the Verizon shares will be credited on 24 February and the cash payment will be made on 4 March. At the same time, Vodafone's shares will be consolidated to reduce the number in issue and ensure a broadly similar share price before and after the distribution of the Verizon Wireless proceeds. Shareholders will receive 6 new shares for every existing 11 Vodafone shares. Analysts at Killik &amp; Co said: Vodafone has been a strong performer over the last year, although the recent statement from AT&amp;T [that it would not bid for Vodafone] has caused some short-term weakness. At the current share price, the remaining Vodafone rump is trading at a discount to the peer group, with the prospect of upgrades if the trading environment improves. In the meantime, the shares offer an attractive 4.9% dividend yield. Furthermore, we note the commitment made by the Vodafone CEO to reinvest his share of the Verizon distribution into Vodafone shares. Meanwhile analysts have been suggesting where investors are likely to reinvest their payouts. Major companies such as HSBC, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca are likely to be among the beneficiaries, they believe. Speaking of Vodafone, currently 1.35p lower at 222.65p, satellite operator Avanti Communications has announced it has signed a three year agreement to supply 3G backhaul services - the links between the central network and outlying hubs - to one of the mobile phone group's European companies. Avanti shares have climbed 6% to 217.75p on the news. Analysts at French bank Natixis said: The service will enable Vodafone to connect up its base stations and core network at a much lower cost than with terrestrial solutions (fibre, DSL, radio) in isolated and sparsely populated regions. Avanti had already mentioned that it was conducting tests with Vodafone. As such, this contract is not entirely surprising. It is still extremely good news for Avanti, however, as it provides proof of the quality of Avanti's backhaul solution, [it] will substantially boost the group's prospective sales in the second half of 2014 [and] in the medium term, it opens up enormous potential in terms of demand. Indeed, the connection of just 2,000 base stations would be enough to use up all of the capacity on the two satellites Avanti currently has in orbit.",

Founded in 1991, the firm trades from 369 stores across the UK and 246 small-animal veterinary surgeries, principally under a joint-venture model using the Companion Care and Vets4Pets brand names. The group also runs 116 in-store grooming salons. It wants more than 500 UK stores, 700 veterinary practices and 300 \"groom rooms\" in the medium term. The listing of Pets at Home is one of many expected in Britain's retail sector in 2014: the Russian hypermarket chain Lenta, the newsagent and convenience store McColl's, and the online domestic appliances retailer AO have all, like Poundland, announced plans to float. Nick Wood, chief executive, said Pets at Home was floating \"with a clear leadership position in the UK pet care market and with a mission to be the best pet shop in the world\". He added: \"We have delivered consistently strong financial growth, and since 2009 we have gained share across all segments of the market.\"",

      "bodyText": "Victoria faces another blow to its economy after Royal Dutch Shell reportedly sold Geelong refinery, putting 500 jobs at risk. The oil major sold the asset and its Australian petrol stations to Dutch-owned oil trader Vitol and the Abu Dhabi Investment Council for about $2.4bn, Fairfax Media reports. The refinery, which struggles to compete with larger, more efficient facilities in Asia, faces an uncertain future. It is believed that Vitol, the world\u2019s largest oil trader, has earmarked the 60-year-old refinery for closure once it takes control of the business. Shell had planned to convert the refinery, which employs 500 people, into a fuel import terminal if a buyer could not be found. A Shell spokesman in Australia told Reuters he would not comment on \u201cspeculation\u201d. A closure would be a further devastating blow to the Victorian economy, coming hard on the heels of the announcement on Tuesday that Alcoa\u2019s Point Henry smelter will close in August and the planned withdrawal of car makers Toyota, Holden and Ford from Australia. Vitol and its partners are reported to have won out in the bid for the assets over another party made up of Macquarie Capital and powerful miner-trader Glencore Xstrata. Private equity investment firm TPG had also been vying for the assets though has been out of the sale process for some time. The sale is part of Shell\u2019s reported wider plan under chief executive Ben van Beurden to offload up to $US15bn ($16.7bn) of assets worldwide in the next two years. Shell, which has a partnership with supermarket operator Coles in Australia, has had its Geelong refinery on the market since April 2013. It later broadened the sale to include Australian petrol stations.",
