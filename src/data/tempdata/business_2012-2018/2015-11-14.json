      "bodyText": "For one Chinese company that depends on global trade, fears over the worldwide economy have come to pass already. \u201cThe global economy is pretty bleak at the moment,\u201d says Luo Dong, the owner of Doyoung, a Beijing-based exporter of frozen seafood and fruit. \u201cThis is having a big effect on us. Our clients\u2019 sales are a lot slower than they used to be, and as purchasing power overseas drops, our exports are taking a hit.\u201d Luo\u2019s observations were echoed on a wider stage last week, when the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development voiced the fear gripping many economists: that the drop-off in trade, driven by China, may be a harbinger of something more worrying \u2013 a global recession. Days later, Rolls-Royce became the latest British exporter to face what it called \u201cheadwinds\u201d from China, joining a slew of others, from carmaker Jaguar Land Rover to luxury brand Burberry. Meanwhile, commodities including platinum and crude oil resumed their decline in value as investors continued to fret about sliding demand for the raw materials of global commerce. Beijing has cut interest rates six times in less than a year and let the yuan slide against the dollar, underlining the sense of alarm about slowing growth. Official figures show GDP expanding at around 6.9% in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, conveniently in line with the government\u2019s official target of \u201caround 7%\u201d; but outside analysts believe it may be much weaker. \u201cWe find these numbers pretty implausible,\u201d says Andrew Brigden of City consultancy Fathom. \u201cChina is slowing a lot more markedly than the official figures show.\u201d Fathom\u2019s calculations, based on alternative indicators such as electricity use, suggest GDP growth of 3% or even less. However, inside China it feels as though sluggish demand from the eurozone, rather than a homegrown problem, is to blame for the deterioration in the economic weather. Luo, whose company exports to the US, Europe, Middle East and Africa, says exports have roughly halved since last year. \u201cThe worst market has been Europe, largely due to exchange rate fluctuations,\u201d he says. The European Central Bank has deliberately driven down the value of the single currency by implementing quantitative easing. \u201cThe other major factor has been labour costs here, which have gone up about a third,\u201d Luo adds. For the UK, so far, the impact of global trade headwinds has been relatively mild, notwithstanding the tone of alarm from exporters. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the UK manufacturers\u2019 association EEF, says: \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s certainly on our members\u2019 radar, and it\u2019s a source of concern.\u201d But for a string of other countries, especially those heavily dependent on commodities exports, the result has been economic chaos \u2013 and the OECD fears worse may be to come. After the great financial crisis hit in 2008, reports that demand for exports had \u201cfallen off a cliff\u201d, as it was often put at the time, were among the first signals that a deep downturn was under way. \u201cGlobal trade, which was already growing slowly over the past few years, appears to have stagnated,\u201d said Angel Gurr\u00eda, the OECD\u2019s secretary general, presenting its latest economic forecasts and predicting trade growth of around 2% this year. \u201cWhat happened in the past 50 years whenever there was such a slowdown in trade growth, it was a harbinger of a very sharp turn of the economy for the worse.\u201d Gurr\u00eda explained that the recent slowdown in emerging market economies, led by China, had been particularly damaging because it had come at a time when the advanced economies, in particular the eurozone and Japan, were not yet growing at a robust enough pace to drive global growth. \u201cA further sharp slowdown in emerging market economies is weighing down on activity and trade. At the same time, subdued investment and productivity growth are checking the momentum of the recovery in advanced economies. It\u2019s a double whammy,\u201d Gurr\u00eda said. The OECD\u2019s prescription for this malaise is a collective effort by the advanced economies to ramp up investment \u2013 helping to boost demand, improve productivity and generate stronger growth. A similar approach was set out by President Barack Obama on Friday, and he is likely to press for more action to prop up domestic demand at this weekend\u2019s G20 meeting in Turkey. But with Germany and the UK still enthusiastically espousing austerity, any commitment to new investment seems highly unlikely; so economists have been left trying to count the costs of China\u2019s transition from high-speed, export-led growth to a new economic model at a time when demand in other markets is far from booming. Economist and China-watcher George Magnus reckons the world will avoid recession, but the damage will be severe for economies that have hitched themselves to the Chinese bandwagon in recent years. \u201cIn Africa, exports to China are 12% of total exports, but three-quarters of the exposure is concentrated among five countries: Angola, South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea,\u201d he said in a recent blogpost. \u201cIn Australia, exports to China are a third of total exports. In Latin America, exports to China are about 2% of regional GDP.\u201d Most of these countries are exporters of coal, oil and minerals, and their struggles coincide with the end of what became known as the \u201ccommodities supercycle\u201d \u2013 a decade or so in which prices were held aloft by the belief that demand for raw materials would continue rising, as developing economies became the engines of global growth. Goldman Sachs\u2019s decision to close down its loss-making Bric fund was a symbolic reminder that the days are gone when the economic rise of Brazil, Russia, India and China (the four countries from which the fund drew its name) seemed guaranteed. Indeed, Brazil and Russia are both in recession. The US Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to raise interest rates from near zero, which many experts now expect to happen next month, could deepen the agony of countries already struggling with plunging currencies and rising borrowing costs. The International Monetary Fund has warned of a flurry of bankruptcies in emerging economies as rates rise. \u201cA lot of these countries haven\u2019t been helping themselves: Taiwan, Korea; they\u2019ve all been cranking up their own credit growth,\u201d says Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting, an economics advisory firm. But he too believes the world should escape a general slump. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re on the cusp of a major downturn \u2014 probably more of the same.\u201d Simon Evenett of St Gallen University in Switzerland, who collates detailed data for the thinktank Global Trade Alert, offers an alternative explanation for the recent slide in trade volumes. He calculates that about half of the fall, since exports peaked in September last year, has been caused by the commodity price rout; but the rest, rather than evidence of sickly global demand, has resulted from a creeping rise in protectionism. His analysis suggests the declines have overwhelmingly taken place in just 28 categories of product. \u201cThat\u2019s very concentrated; that makes me doubt that it\u2019s a global downturn.\u201d Eight of these categories are commodities; but the rest map closely on to areas where countries have taken protectionist measures. In the wake of the financial crisis, policymakers from the G20 countries pledged not to resort to the tit-for-tat protectionism that led to collapsing trade volumes in the wake of the Great Crash of 1929, and was ultimately seen as a contributor to the Great Depression. Since then, there has been little sign of anything with the scope of America\u2019s Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, which slapped import tariffs on more than 800 products. But Evenett says there has been a flurry of more subtle manoeuvres: restricting public procurement to domestic firms, for example, or quietly tightening regulations to raise the bar against imports. \u201cI think the China story is adding spice to it, but I think there\u2019s more going on here,\u201d he says. He is concerned that unless action is taken, politicians will continue to throw sand in the wheels of the international trading system. If he\u2019s right, the downturn seen so far may not be sending a warning signal about global demand; instead, it would be best read as a measure of the fragility of globalisation.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When the long-delayed official report into the near-collapse of HBOS is released on Thursday former bank bosses James Crosby, Andy Hornby and Lord Stevenson will be braced for a fresh round of condemnation. But if the report\u2019s 500 pages are likely to revive painful criticism of their role in the demise of Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender and savings institution, its publication also marks a crucial moment for a lesser known former executive at the bank: Paul Moore. Moore, 57, emerged some years ago as the whistleblower at HBOS. He said he was sacked as head of group regulatory risk at the end of 2004 \u2013 less than two years after joining \u2013 after warning that the then fast-growing bank was too strongly motivated by sales. His views were first aired in public shortly after the bank had to be rescued by Lloyds in September 2008. The enlarged institution was later bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayer money. On learning that the publication of the report by the Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England \u2013 first promised in 2013 \u2013 has finally been scheduled for Thursday, Moore said: \u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous and a bit frightened and I hope and pray I\u2019m not going to have to fight for the next five years.\u201d His main fear now, he says, is that the report could turn out to be \u201ca cover-up and a fudge\u201d. If he was writing it, he says, he would refer the directors not just for banning orders but for criminal investigation, as well as demanding a proper judicial inquiry into the auditing of all the big banks and the conduct of the credit ratings agencies. That is not all. \u201cI would name and shame in the most rigorous detail the ludicrously bad regulators,\u201d says Moore. Thursday\u2019s report will be published alongside an analysis of the decision by the City regulator at the time of the collapse, the Financial Services Authority, to punish only one HBOS banker \u2013 Peter Cummings, who ran the bank\u2019s commercial lending arm and has now been banned for life from the City and fined \u00a3500,000. Work on the official report only began after the enforcement action against Cummings, although in 2013 the parliamentary commission on banking standards, set up in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal, published its own account of the collapse. It accused Crosby, Hornby and Stevenson of \u201ccolossal\u201d management failures and questioned why it was only Cummings who had been censured by the City regulator. Earlier evidence Moore had given to the Treasury select committee in 2009 had been so damning it led to a fresh examination of the role of Crosby, and forced his resignation as deputy chairman of the then City regulator, the Financial Services Authority. When Moore\u2019s allegations were first aired at the select committee, Crosby had insisted there was no substance to them. A report \u2013 commissioned from the bank\u2019s auditors, KPMG \u2013 concluded that he lost his job because of personality clashes inside the lender and not that Crosby sacked him because of warnings that HBOS was \u201cgoing too fast\u201d. Crosby has since handed back his knighthood and 30% of his pension, and keeps out of the public eye. Moore says he is not seeking vindication himself from the long-delayed report. As far as he is concerned this has already been achieved and he cites a wave of publicity, including an appearance opposite Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight. But the whistleblowing experience nearly killed him, he says. His book, published this month \u2013 Crash Bank Wallop \u2013 gives a no-holds-barred account of his private life, his struggle with alcoholism and depression, and describes a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in June this year. Having set up his own publisher \u2013 New Wilberforce \u2013 to produce the book, he has ambitions for it to become the go-to publisher for whistleblowers. He attributes his survival to his wife Maureen \u2013 whom he met up a mountain in Chile on Christmas day 1988 \u2013 and his Christianity. A Catholic, he was educated at Ampleforth college, north Yorkshire. Of the former HBOS bosses, he said: \u201cThe road to hell is paved with good intentions \u2026 They may have subjectively been thinking what they were doing was right, but they were completely and utterly wrong and they need to be held to account for it.\u201d But his ire is not only aimed at HBOS officials and non-executive directors. John Griffith-Jones, the boss of the Financial Conduct Authority, the current City watchdog, should quit, he says, because he was formerly chairman of KPMG, auditor of HBOS, as well as a string of other banks. Moore is himself a former partner at KPMG and it was accountants and professional advisors that failed more than anyone else, he believes. The ink on his first book is barely dry, but Moore is already preparing his second, with the working title \u201cLove Truth Justice\u201d, in which he aims to lift the lid on the slow pace of the HBOS report. He has tried to mend fences with Stevenson, Crosby and Hornby \u2013 to no avail \u2013 and would like a truth and reconciliation commission to be set up. The former bosses, he believes, should \u201cface up to what they\u2019ve done and have a revelatory moment, and then make amends\u201d. Then, he says, \u201cwe could move on to a new form of caring, clean and collaborative capitalism\u201d. THE PLAYERS James Crosby Chief executive until 2006, Crosby was asked to lead a number of government inquiries after his departure. But after the 2009 parliamentary commission on banking standards report, he asked to be stripped of his knighthood and gave up 30% of his \u00a3580,000 a year pension. He also left the board of catering group Compass and private equity house Bridgepoint. \u201cI am deeply sorry for what happened at HBOS,\u201d he has said. Andy Hornby Hornby took over as chief executive from Crosby after running the retail arm of HBOS. He is now the chief operating officer of bookmaker Gala Coral. Lord Stevenson The first and only chairman of HBOS. He is currently chairing two charities: Inter Mediate, set up by Tony Blair\u2019s former chief of staff Jonathan Powell to negotiate in conflict zones, and MQ, which supports mental health research. Peter Cummings The former head of the commercial arm, Cummings accused the Financial Services Authority, the then City regulator, of \u201ctokenism at its most sinister\u201d when he was banned from working in the City and fined \u00a3500,000 in September 2012.",

      "body": "<p>When the long-delayed official report into the near-collapse of HBOS is released on Thursday former bank bosses James Crosby, Andy Hornby and Lord Stevenson will be braced for a fresh round of condemnation.</p> <p>But if the report\u2019s 500 pages are likely to revive painful criticism of their role in the demise of Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender and savings institution, its publication also marks a crucial moment for a lesser known former executive at the bank: Paul Moore.</p> <p>Moore, 57, emerged some years ago as the whistleblower at HBOS. He said he was sacked as head of group regulatory risk at the end of 2004 \u2013 less than two years after joining \u2013 after warning that the then fast-growing bank was too strongly motivated by sales.</p> <p>His views were first aired in public shortly after the bank had to be rescued by Lloyds in September 2008. The enlarged institution was later bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayer money.</p> <p>On learning that the publication of the report by the Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England \u2013 first promised in 2013 \u2013 has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/long-delayed-hbos-report-to-be-published-next-week\" title=\"\">finally been scheduled for Thursday</a>, Moore said: \u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous and a bit frightened and I hope and pray I\u2019m not going to have to fight for the next five years.\u201d His main fear now, he says, is that the report could turn out to be \u201ca cover-up and a fudge\u201d.</p> <p>If he was writing it, he says, he would refer the directors not just for banning orders but for criminal investigation, as well as demanding a proper judicial inquiry into the auditing of all the big banks and the conduct of the credit ratings agencies.</p> <p>That is not all. \u201cI would name and shame in the most rigorous detail the ludicrously bad regulators,\u201d says Moore.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s report will be published alongside an analysis of the decision by the City regulator at the time of the collapse, the Financial Services Authority, to punish only one HBOS banker \u2013 Peter Cummings, who ran the bank\u2019s commercial lending arm and has<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/12/hbos-banker-peter-cummings-banned-fined-fsa\" title=\"\"> now been banned for life from the City and fined \u00a3500,000.</a></p> <p>Work on the official report only began after the enforcement action against Cummings, although in 2013 the parliamentary commission on banking standards, set up in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal, published its own account of the collapse. It accused Crosby, Hornby and Stevenson of \u201ccolossal\u201d management failures and questioned why it was only Cummings who had been censured by the City regulator.</p> <p>Earlier evidence Moore had given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/11/hbos-banking\" title=\"\">to the Treasury select committee in 2009</a> had been so damning it led to a fresh examination of the role of Crosby, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/12/james-crosby-fsa-resignation-whistleblower\" title=\"\">forced his resignation</a> as deputy chairman of the then City regulator, the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>When Moore\u2019s allegations were first aired at the select committee, Crosby had insisted there was no substance to them. A report \u2013 commissioned from the bank\u2019s auditors, KPMG \u2013 concluded that he lost his job because of personality clashes inside the lender and not that Crosby sacked him because of warnings that HBOS was \u201cgoing too fast\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/09/james-crosby-give-up-knighthood-pension\" title=\"\">Crosby has since handed back his knighthood and 30% of his pension,</a> and keeps out of the public eye.</p> <p>Moore says he is not seeking vindication himself from the long-delayed report. As far as he is concerned this has already been achieved and he cites a wave of publicity, including an appearance opposite Jeremy Paxman on <em>Newsnight</em>.</p> <p>But the whistleblowing experience nearly killed him, he says. His book, published this month \u2013 <em>Crash Bank Wallop</em> \u2013 gives a no-holds-barred account of his private life, his struggle with alcoholism and depression, and describes a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in June this year. Having set up his own publisher \u2013 New Wilberforce \u2013 to produce the book, he has ambitions for it to become the go-to publisher for whistleblowers. He attributes his survival to his wife Maureen \u2013 whom he met up a mountain in Chile on Christmas day 1988 \u2013 and his Christianity. A Catholic, he was educated at Ampleforth college, north Yorkshire.</p> <p>Of the former HBOS bosses, he said: \u201cThe road to hell is paved with good intentions \u2026 They may have subjectively been thinking what they were doing was right, but they were completely and utterly wrong and they need to be held to account for it.\u201d</p> <p>But his ire is not only aimed at HBOS officials and non-executive directors. John Griffith-Jones, the boss of the Financial Conduct Authority, the current City watchdog, should quit, he says, because he was formerly chairman of KPMG, auditor of HBOS, as well as a string of other banks.</p> <p>Moore is himself a former partner at KPMG and it was accountants and professional advisors that failed more than anyone else, he believes.</p> <p>The ink on his first book is barely dry, but Moore is already preparing his second, with the working title \u201cLove Truth Justice\u201d, in which he aims to lift the lid on the slow pace of the HBOS report.</p> <p>He has tried to mend fences with Stevenson, Crosby and Hornby \u2013 to no avail \u2013 and would like a truth and reconciliation commission to be set up.</p> <p>The former bosses, he believes, should \u201cface up to what they\u2019ve done and have a revelatory moment, and then make amends\u201d.</p> <p>Then, he says, \u201cwe could move on to a new form of caring, clean and collaborative capitalism\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"845b0ffe9d4b0fb34b6aa5f753873a5cd272f4bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/845b0ffe9d4b0fb34b6aa5f753873a5cd272f4bf/0_115_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Crosby at the start of his career at HBOS in 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Crosby at the start of his career at HBOS in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Garry Weaser for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>THE PLAYERS</h2> <p><strong>James Crosby</strong><br>Chief executive until 2006, Crosby was asked to lead a number of government inquiries after his departure.

He also left the board of catering group Compass and private equity house Bridgepoint. \u201cI am deeply sorry for what happened at HBOS,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/09/former-hbos-chief-statement-knighthood-pension-full-text\" title=\"\">he has said</a>.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hornby</strong><br>Hornby took over as chief executive from Crosby after running the retail arm of HBOS.

      "bodyText": "News that UK unemployment was at its lowest level since 2008 was trumpeted over the airwaves last week. Yet in the north-east of England joblessness is still rising and far outstrips the national average. And for Teesside, rocked as it has been by the closure of its last remaining steelworks, the outlook is particularly bleak, with dole queues lengthening and the full fallout of the Redcar closure still to be felt. On Thursday, the situation worsened with the shock announcement that 220 employees and 140 contractors at the UK\u2019s only potash mine, down the coast at Boulby, are set to lose their jobs. Sue Jeffrey, leader of Redcar and Cleveland borough council, said the area\u2019s job market was going into meltdown. \u201cI used that word,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause we are dependent on a small number of large industries and when we lose the jobs in those industries there is nothing to replace them.\u201d Over the past five years, council regeneration schemes have helped create 2,500 jobs, but Jeffrey said: \u201cOver the last number of weeks we\u2019ve lost all those \u2013 they\u2019ve been wiped out. So where are the new jobs going to come from?\u201d On Friday, the government announced a new Tees Valley Inward Investment Initiative, chaired by Lord Heseltine and tasked with boosting growth and creating jobs. It will have a specific brief to attract foreign investment and raise the region\u2019s international profile. Heseltine\u2019s appointment will be controversial, given his suggestion last month that now was \u201ca good time\u201d for steelworkers to be made redundant because of the number of new jobs in the economy. Heseltine, who led a regeneration initiative on Merseyside in the 1980s, will visit the region on Monday with James Wharton, Northern Powerhouse minister and Tory MP for the Teesside constituency of Stockton South. Announcing the initiative, business secretary Sajid Javid said: \u201cThe closure of the SSI Steelworks plant was a huge blow to local people. On top of the up to \u00a380m package of direct support, we are determined to do all we can to secure long-term growth for the area.\u201d Local politicians and the area\u2019s chamber of commerce had called for immediate government assistance following last week\u2019s job losses. Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South, speaking before the plan was announced, said the government had so far been like \u201crabbits caught in the headlights\u201d. Further job losses across the region, have included 700 contractors laid off in Billingham as construction of an energy plant was paused, and a further 100 steel redundancies at Caparo in Hartlepool. Adding to Teesside\u2019s woes came news that 700 jobs were at risk in Stockton and Middlesbrough as HM Revenue and Customs cuts staffing levels. Blenkinsop said: \u201cUnless we have some sort of countercyclical investment \u2013 including potentially some public investment to bring in the private finance \u2013 and try to mitigate what has happened, it\u2019s pretty grim reading.\u201d He added that the issue for the region right now is coping with so many redundant industrial workers. \u201cI am certain that every single worker \u2013 be they steelworkers, process workers, contractors, miners, electricians or engineers \u2013 has more than enough in the way of skills. The issues are whether they can stay in the locality, and whether they can get a job that pays anything like the good wages they were on at Boulby or SSI.\u201d The entire Tees Valley, from heavily urban areas to small villages, has been hit by the job losses. Boulby sits on cliffs swooping down to the North Sea on the edge of the North York Moors. The potash mine is this area\u2019s biggest employer and much of the workforce live locally. Blenkinsop says such job losses will be a huge blow to a fragile rural economy. Cleveland Potash, owner of the Boulby mine, has given few details about which of its 1,100 employees are at risk, which workers say is causing unwelcome uncertainty so close to Christmas. Steven Hodgson, 26, an electrician who has worked at Boulby for eight years, says the mine\u2019s survival is crucial. \u201cIt\u2019s massive. There\u2019s not much big industry left around here. It\u2019s going to be on a downward spiral, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Early last month, the government announced a \u00a380m support package for sacked SSI steelworkers, though some of that will be used for redundancy pay. Millions has been allocated to retraining and supply chain support schemes, and Jeffrey said around 100 former steelworkers had found new positions at specially arranged job fairs. But one of these workers \u2013 26-year-old Jamie, who starts his first training course on Monday \u2013 said the job fair was attended largely by recruitment agencies and companies offering commission-based work. \u201cThe chances of finding something well-paid on Teesside are slim now,\u201d he said. Blenkinsop and Jeffrey point to plans to build carbon capture and storage facilities as evidence that there can be an industrial solution to the current crisis. Jeffrey is confident Teesside can bounce back over the longer term with the right support. \u201cWe are a resilient place. These are really difficult times but we\u2019re not going to let them beat us.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There are a lot of people in Silicon Valley and New York betting on \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2013 the new breed of tech startups like Uber, Square, Airbnb and Snapchat that have been valued at least $1bn. Not since the last dotcom boom has so much money been poured into so many hyped companies. As startup founders and their investors hope to turn their paper unicorn fortunes into cold hard cash, some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most successful investors are warning a reckoning is coming. And on Wedneday that magical thinking faces one of its biggest tests. Square, the mobile payments platform co-founded by Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey, will sell shares in New York at a $4bn valuation. A year ago, private investors valued Square at $6bn. Now questions are being asked about whether Dorsey can really juggle his duties at troubled Twitter and a once hot startup that has yet to show any signs of making a profit. If Monday\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) goes badly, a lot of other profitless unicorns will start feeling the chill. One big problem for the unicorns is that there are simply too many of them. When the term was coined by venture capitalist Aileen Lee in 2013, unicorn was the perfect way to encapsulate something rare, magical and mythical: in this case, a $1bn startup. But analysts and investors say the version 2.0 tech bubble has inflated so much that the term unicorn no longer fits. So much private money (increasingly from established institutional investors, which previously steered clear of such risky investments) has been pumping into tech firms that $1bn startups are no longer rare, magical or mythical, and it could mean that the tech bubble is about to burst again. \u201cI do think you\u2019ll see some dead unicorns this year,\u201d Bill Gurley, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Benchmark, has said. Another VC, Todd Dagres of Spark Capital in Boston, said: \u201cIf you wake up in a room full of unicorns, you are dreaming and you can\u2019t expect the dream to continue.\u201d In November 2013, only 39 tech startups had been worth $1bn pre-flotation in the past decade (Google and Amazon were worth nowhere near $1bn before their IPOs). Today there are 82 $1bn pre-IPO startups in the US and a total of 125 worldwide, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal. The combined valuation of all US unicorns is $486bn \u2013 more than the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of Austria, Colombia or South Africa \u2013 and not one has made any profit, as they are all concentrated on aggressively spending to expand their reach and thereby increase their valuation before floatation. There are so many unicorns that Silicon Valley needs a new term to describe the most successful new firms: the decacorn, a made-up word for a startup worth more than $10bn. There are still quite a few of these. Uber this summer was valued at $51bn (\u00a333.4bn) (that\u2019s almost four times as much as Marks &amp; Spencer is worth); Airbnb attracted $2.5bn more investment in June that valued it at $25.5bn (\u00a316.8bn); and Snapchat\u2019s latest funding round valued the disappearing-photo app at $16bn (\u00a310.5bn). There is a growing unease among investors that few, if any, of these companies are really worth the valuations they have attracted, which would make the tech bubble burst as it did at the turn of the century. Attention this week turned to Snapchat when established mutual fund Fidelity wrote down the value of its investment in the four-year-old company, which is used by more than 100m people a day, by 25%. Fidelity has also written down its stake in Dropbox, the cloud storage company, by 31%, and the company has quietly dropped its IPO plans. In 2014 it was valued at $10bn, but its bankers have warned it will struggle to attract anywhere near that on the public market. Eyes are now turning towards Square \u2013 a payment system that allows anyone to take credit payments via a card reader attached to an iPad \u2013 which has announced its plans to float in New York. But it won\u2019t be a celebratory moment for all investors. Square, which gave potential investors a square-shaped 250-page prospectus over lunch in Manhattan\u2019s chic Midtown Loft &amp; Terrace this week, is also facing questions over the abilities of Dorsey. His other company, Twitter is failing to match Wall Street\u2019s expectations on revenue or profits, and user growth has all but dried up with new users increasing by just 1.3% in its latest quarter. The company\u2019s shares, which peaked at $69 in January 2014, were changing hands for $26 on Friday \u2013 the exact value they were floated at in November 2013. Dorsey, 38, is currently juggling the CEO role of both companies. Many feel Square\u2019s IPO could, in hindsight, be seen as the trigger that burst the 2.0 tech bubble, that it could wipe billions off the values of the biggest beasts such as Uber that are hoping to follow it down the IPO path. Ominously, as the company announced the price range its former chief operating officer Keith Rabois tweeted: \u201cThe steroid era of start-ups is over.\u201d \u201cI think Square is the beginning of the end of the tech bubble,\u201d Sam Hamadeh, founder and chief executive of financial research firm PrivCo, said. \u201cIn terms of the number of unicorns, I have never seen anything like it in 25 years. \u201cWith Square, not only is it the first one where investors are being asked to take a haircut going into it, but I think it will get worse. What already sounds horrible will go on to be terrible.\u201d Hamadeh said he expects some of Square\u2019s early investors will lose out on their original investments, while late-stage investors have been guaranteed at least a 20% return on the $15.46 they paid last year on the IPO. The company has promised to issue new shares to pay for that return if the shares don\u2019t achieve it in the flotation. He said investors are prepared to accept a loss, as they have \u201ccome to the realisation that \u2018yes, we overpaid\u2019\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Square \u2013 a lot of these unicorn funding rounds have been massively overpaid. It is because there has been a disproportionately large amount of investment from established firms that did not invest in startups five years ago, but have gotten into it because they feel they have been missing out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they will be the biggest losers. In our opinion, they have no business being in this space; they will look back and say \u2018That was insane\u2019, and the date everyone starts to realise that will be the date of Square\u2019s IPO.\u201d Alan Patrick, co-founder of technology consultancy Broadsight, agreed that there has been too much \u201cirrational enthusiasm\u201d for investing in startups, and it is unlikely to be matched by what the market is prepared to pay at IPOs. \u201cThe private market has been driving these valuations to extraordinary levels, and as they approach the public market the smart money is starting look at it and go \u2018oh no, no, no\u2019. \u201cThe number of unicorns is a sign that there is a bubble in the private market \u2013 in the dotcom era there were 10 or something, now there are too many to count,\u201d he said. \u201cThat for me is a sign that these values are untested and out of step with reality. And none of them are making money, they are all buying revenue with huge war chests.\u201d Patrick reckoned the 2.0 tech bubble will come to be defined by the unicorn. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the \u2018big swinging dick\u2019 of the last one [the build-up to the financial crisis], there is alway a name that attached to a bubble; for this one it will be the unicorn.\u201d But he added that he doesn\u2019t think the bubble is about to burst just yet. For that to happen, he said, there needs to be an \u201cinsanity event\u201d \u2013 \u201csomething that in hindsight is so extraordinarily crazy, but looked normal at time\u201d. \u201cLast time it was AOL-Time Warner [a $165bn takeover]. It\u2019ll be an event when everyone goes, \u2018Oh my god, that was nuts\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m waiting for, and when that happens you blow the whistle.\u201d",
