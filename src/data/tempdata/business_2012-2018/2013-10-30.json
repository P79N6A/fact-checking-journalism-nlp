London has seen 61 flotations so far this year, according to the analyst firm Dealogic, raising a total of \u00a38.7bn from floats that have included estate agent Foxtons and the insurer Esure. For the whole of last year, London flotations raised \u00a33.5bn via 46 issues.</p> <p>Merlin, which also owns Alton Towers, the London Eye, and Warwick Castle, is perhaps best known in the UK as the owner of the waxworks museum on Marylebone road in central London, which traces its UK roots back more than 200 years. Madame Tussaud brought her exhibition on tour to Britain in 1802, and established The Baker Street Bazaar in 1835, while the attraction moved to its current site in 1884. It claims to have received 500 million visitors since its creation.</p> <p>Despite the waxworks being widely known, Merlin's other brands are its biggest money earners. In total the company runs 99 attractions across 22 countries, taking \u00a31bn in revenue last year from 54 million visitors and making \u00a398m of profit. Of those venues, six of Europe's top 20 most visited theme parks are run by Merlin, according to analysts Aecom, three of which \u2013 Alton Towers in Staffordshire, Legoland in Windsor and Thorpe Park in Chertsey \u2013 are based in Britain.</p> <p>Now the holding company is set to go public, valuing the 36% stake currently held by Kirkbi at about \u00a31.2bn, Blackstone's 34% at \u00a31.1bn and CVC's 28% at \u00a3900m, although the firms will be cashing in \u00a3600m worth of shares. Merlin was last valued in 2010 when CVC acquired its stake, and the whole business was worth \u00a32.25bn.</p> <p>Senior management and around 2,000 employees, who will end up owning about 8% of the firm are also preparing for windfalls, particularly chief executive Nick Varney, and finance director Andrew Carr who completed a private-equity backed management buyout of the company in 1999 to create Merlin. Since then the group has acquired the Tussauds Group, which also included Chessington World of Adventures and Thorpe Park, plus the Italian theme park Gardaland.</p> <p>\"Our destiny was always to be a public company,\" said Varney as he recalled a previous aborted effort to float his management buyout, plus a series of different private equity owners, including Apax and Hermes, before settling on the current shareholders. \"Being bought every three years can be disruptive. Now is the time for long-term share ownership\".</p> <p>It is also the time to re-jig its corporate structure that means the company is based in Luxembourg.

It said the labour market had shown some improvement but the unemployment rate remained high. The recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months.</p> <p>It believed, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate would gradually decline.</p> <p>It decided to await more evidence that progress would be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases, hence it decided to maintain the bond buying programme at the current level:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective. Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.</p> <p>To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p>The only member to vote against the action was Esther George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52714a1be4b051882ae4f5b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T18:04:31.405Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20131030a.htm\">the full Fed statement.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5271484fe4b0bde9b4af6d74\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T18:01:40.361Z\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fed keeps bond buying programme at $85bn</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US Federal Reserve has kept its monthly bond buying progreamme at $85bn, and make no change to its forward guidance on interest rates.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52714218e4b051882ae4f5af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T17:35:05.225Z\">5.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in Greece prime minister Antonis Samaras is holding much-anticipated talks with his coalition partner Evangelos Venizelos amid mounting tensions ahead of next week\u2019s forthcoming visit by officials representing the debt-crippled nation\u2019s foreign creditors. Helena Smith writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before it has even happened the arrival here on Monday of mission heads representing the EU, ECB and IMF is already being met with dread. Tonight\u2019s meeting between Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and his deputy Evangelos Venizelos comes amid growing tensions with the country\u2019s troika of foreign creditors as friction also mounts over how to plug a looming public funding gap estimated at \u20ac500m by the Greek government and closer to \u20ac2bn by the troika.</p> <p>Officially, the ruling coalition \u2013 an uneasy alliance of conservatives and socialists with a wafer thin majority \u2013 is insisting that there can be no more budget cuts in a nation that long ago reached breaking point under the weight of austerity. Both politicians have repeatedly said that the demand for yet more cuts to make up for any deficit would be to tempt fate as the measures would almost certainly be voted down by MPs and the government would fall. Last week, in a first, the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras raised the prospect of making up for the shortfall by tweaking social security funds \u2013 in itself an admission that measures, of some sort, would have to be made. The government\u2019s only technocrat, the macro-economics professor said the policy of sticking to \u201cno more measures\u201d risked destroying Greece\u2019s rescue program altogether \u2013 not least the promise of further debt relief down the line.</p> <p>But his announcement was immediately met with consternation by other government ministers, including the Labour and social security minister who flatly ruled out further reductions to pensions in any form.</p> <p>Stuck between a rock and a hard place the government has very little room for manoeuvre \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t stick to the rules the regular injection of foreign cash that has kept bankruptcy at bay will simply dry up. Officially, tonight\u2019s meeting is all about Samaras and Venizelos drawing up a \u2018strategy\u2019 that will prevent them straying over \u201cred lines\u201d. But the troika is playing hardball and has already hinted that with the numbers, once again, not adding up it will likely reject Stournaras\u2019 plan. Black clouds beckon.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-42a2d5c7-b878-4882-9066-b27fc2331233\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383154491439/a876b6e5-3823-4150-ad80-f6a40dea0c9f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek athletes, who have taken posts in the public sector after their distinction in European championships and Olympic Games, held a rally opposing the planned suspension from their jobs.

In a statement earlier today the ministry announced that unpaid taxes increased by \u20ac809m in September bringing the total amount owed by taxpayers to a \u20ac6.1bn so far this year.</p> <p>Overall, it added, Greeks owed some \u20ac59.6bn in unpaid taxes to the state \u2013 the equivalent of nearly a fifth of the government\u2019s debt and a drain on public finances like no other. Tax arrears in 2012, by comparison, came to around \u20ac56bn.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s chaotic tax collection machine has been the bane of troika officials since the start of the debt crisis with Athens under immense pressure to crack down on evaders. The latest losses come despite the government instituting an \u201cemergency\u201d property tax and a bevy of new tax laws \u2013 in the last two years more than 20 new tax laws have been enacted. The burgeoning hole is evidence of the counter productiveness of austerity \u2013 assaulted by the ever growing number of duties an ever growing number of Greeks, already hit by pension and pay cuts, have simply resigned themselves to not paying taxes at all.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52712babe4b0cdcad3c03f95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T15:56:23.913Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets are drifting lower now ahead of the US Federal Reserve announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 0.18% and the FTSE 100 down 0.11%.

It would also be no surprise to see a more downbeat description applied to household spending. Last time, the second paragraph contained the following sentence:</p> <p><em>The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall,\u2026</em></p> <p>This sentence surely needs revision in light of the government shutdown/debt ceiling headwinds, maybe even to the extent of the replacement of \u2018diminished\u2019 with \u2018increased\u2019, or a synonym thereof, and maybe, \u2018since the last meeting\u2019.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c0c1cad1-c70c-41b5-bbdb-28a2eaf58289\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383145332470/ed2a131b-4dcf-48dc-b9f8-76f35b4a8a8d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"All eyes on the Federal Reserve.

Not much of a move, but enough to keep European markets in positive territory. The FTSE 100 has been flirting with the May high of 6840 - if it surpasses that the index will be at its best level since December 1999 - but is currently up 0.07% at 6779.35.</p> <p>On the ADP jobs data itself, not only did the private sector add 130,000 jobs in October compared to an expected 150,000 but September's figure was revised down from 166,000 to 145,000. The figures came as the US government temporarily shut down over the political impasse on the budget. James Knightley at ING said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This [fall] reflects the government shutdown and debt default fears, which clearly made corporates reluctant to hire. Indeed, many private sector firms with government contracts will not have been paid and may have been forced to lay-off staff while those not with government contracts will presumably have been concerned about the possible economic damage and delayed hiring.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Federal Reserve Beige Book had suggested that \u201cuncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u201d made firms more cautious on hiring. This is not good news for the BLS employment report, which has been delayed until 8 November, suggesting that the labour market is losing momentum. As such this adds further weight to the case for a delay in Federal Reserve asset purchase tapering.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T14:18:52.223Z\">at 2.18pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52710f3ce4b0ded76c0a9178\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T13:55:49.237Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Kenny rings the NASDAQ bell</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here is an update from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/henrymcdonald\">Henry</a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/henrymcdonald\">&#xa0;McDonald</a> on the New York tech-stock exchange opening in Ireland (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/30/business-blog-wall-street-high-on-stimulus-hopes-live#block-5270d12ae4b08c7e086ff1ae\">9.40</a>).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Enda Kenny</strong> rang the NASDAQ bell and made history as it was the first time the New York based tech-stock exchanged opened in Ireland.</p> <p>After opening the NASDAQ at the Web Summit, the Irish premier told his audience that Ireland had become a \"magnet for tech start ups\" over the last few years.</p> <p>He said the RDS arena was \"full of energy, full of young, skilled, passionate people\" who were driving the Irish tech industry.</p> <p>The Taoiseach said: \"We are the most open economy in the western world and we celebrate our pro business ethos and environment without hesitation....investment in Ireland is at record levels, business believes in Ireland. \"</p> <p>In a more heavily political aside, Kenny claimed his government had restored \"trust and integrity\" in Ireland throughout the world.</p> <p>Later he will help launch a raft of new job announcements in the hi-tech sector at event organised by the Republic's Industrial Development Authority.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p>With that, I'm handing over to my coleague Nick Fletcher.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T14:05:06.508Z\">at 2.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52710ba9e4b01566f5a394ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T13:51:16.761Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cybercrime costs far exceed $100bn</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The next cyberattack could look like Die Hard 4, putting vital infrastructure under threat.

Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Markets seemed faily unmoved by the Fed statement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 24 points, a slight improvement on the level before the announcement. But US treasuries pared gains with some analysts suggesting the Fed's tone was more hawkish than expected. Omar Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonweatlth Foreign Exchange, said: On balance, the Fed's statement was slightly less dovish than expected. What sticks out to me is that the Fed abandoned its previous statement about tightness in financial markets. [This] leaves room for the dollar to appreciate. Eric Stein at Global Income Group said: It's much as expected. Maybe a touch more hawkish. Treasuries sold off a little bit. The yen is weaker, dollar broadly stronger against major currencies. Quotes courtesy Reuters. The Fed said that since its September meeting, economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace. It said the labour market had shown some improvement but the unemployment rate remained high. The recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months. It believed, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate would gradually decline. It decided to await more evidence that progress would be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases, hence it decided to maintain the bond buying programme at the current level: The committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective. Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. The only member to vote against the action was Esther George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations. Here's the full Fed statement. The US Federal Reserve has kept its monthly bond buying progreamme at $85bn, and make no change to its forward guidance on interest rates. Back in Greece prime minister Antonis Samaras is holding much-anticipated talks with his coalition partner Evangelos Venizelos amid mounting tensions ahead of next week\u2019s forthcoming visit by officials representing the debt-crippled nation\u2019s foreign creditors. Helena Smith writes: Before it has even happened the arrival here on Monday of mission heads representing the EU, ECB and IMF is already being met with dread. Tonight\u2019s meeting between Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and his deputy Evangelos Venizelos comes amid growing tensions with the country\u2019s troika of foreign creditors as friction also mounts over how to plug a looming public funding gap estimated at \u20ac500m by the Greek government and closer to \u20ac2bn by the troika. Officially, the ruling coalition \u2013 an uneasy alliance of conservatives and socialists with a wafer thin majority \u2013 is insisting that there can be no more budget cuts in a nation that long ago reached breaking point under the weight of austerity. Both politicians have repeatedly said that the demand for yet more cuts to make up for any deficit would be to tempt fate as the measures would almost certainly be voted down by MPs and the government would fall. Last week, in a first, the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras raised the prospect of making up for the shortfall by tweaking social security funds \u2013 in itself an admission that measures, of some sort, would have to be made. The government\u2019s only technocrat, the macro-economics professor said the policy of sticking to \u201cno more measures\u201d risked destroying Greece\u2019s rescue program altogether \u2013 not least the promise of further debt relief down the line. But his announcement was immediately met with consternation by other government ministers, including the Labour and social security minister who flatly ruled out further reductions to pensions in any form. Stuck between a rock and a hard place the government has very little room for manoeuvre \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t stick to the rules the regular injection of foreign cash that has kept bankruptcy at bay will simply dry up. Officially, tonight\u2019s meeting is all about Samaras and Venizelos drawing up a \u2018strategy\u2019 that will prevent them straying over \u201cred lines\u201d. But the troika is playing hardball and has already hinted that with the numbers, once again, not adding up it will likely reject Stournaras\u2019 plan. Black clouds beckon. European markets have closed, and after some early enthusiasm ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting a note of caution set in, partly due to poor American jobs data. Here are the closing numbers: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 2.97 points or 0.04% at 6777.70 \u2022 Germany's Dax dipped 0.13% to 9010.27 \u2022 France's Cac closed down 0.09% at 4274.11 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.47% lower at 19,166.93 \u2022 Spain's Ibex slipped 0.86% to 9778.7 An hour or so away from the Fed announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually unchanged, down just 0.02%. So we move from the RDS and the Web Summit to the ornate 18th century splendour of Ireland's old Colonial parliament facing Dublin's Trinity College, writes Henry McDonald. The Republic's Industrial Development Authority has organised a bash to celebrate the creation of 335 new hi-tech jobs on the same day at the Summit. The jobs will be spread between Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and include the likes of San Franciso based Nitro which is establishing its European beach head in Ireland. Nitro, the company behind PDF software like Adobe and Acrobat, have created 50 new posts in Dublin. Another North American company, the Canadian based firm, is also opening its EU HQ in the Irish capital with 30 new jobs. The largest number of jobs, 100 in total, is again the result of another technology firm, Adroll, opening a European base in Dublin. Enda Kenny, the Irish premier, is here to officially announce the 300 jobs during a busy day which saw him ringing the NASDAQ bell at the Web Summit. \u201cIreland remains one of the most exciting places in the world for new digital enterprises. I'm delighted to welcome 335 new jobs in nine companies in the rapidly growing digital sector,\u201d he told the audience inside the marbled atrium of the old parliament that is also home to one of Ireland's taxpayer rescued banks, the Bank of Ireland. Over to Greece where the finance ministry has announced that it is owed almost \u20ac60bn in backtaxes. Our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith writes: It has taken the Greek finance ministry itself to puncture the illusion that tax collection is anywhere near normal in the country. In a statement earlier today the ministry announced that unpaid taxes increased by \u20ac809m in September bringing the total amount owed by taxpayers to a \u20ac6.1bn so far this year. Overall, it added, Greeks owed some \u20ac59.6bn in unpaid taxes to the state \u2013 the equivalent of nearly a fifth of the government\u2019s debt and a drain on public finances like no other. Tax arrears in 2012, by comparison, came to around \u20ac56bn. Greece\u2019s chaotic tax collection machine has been the bane of troika officials since the start of the debt crisis with Athens under immense pressure to crack down on evaders. The latest losses come despite the government instituting an \u201cemergency\u201d property tax and a bevy of new tax laws \u2013 in the last two years more than 20 new tax laws have been enacted. The burgeoning hole is evidence of the counter productiveness of austerity \u2013 assaulted by the ever growing number of duties an ever growing number of Greeks, already hit by pension and pay cuts, have simply resigned themselves to not paying taxes at all. Markets are drifting lower now ahead of the US Federal Reserve announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 0.18% and the FTSE 100 down 0.11%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European markets continue to do their best impression of three steps forward and two steps back, hitting five year highs early this morning before sliding back in the wake of this afternoon\u2019s disappointing US October ADP employment report. Whatever the reasons for the positive start and subsequent pullback there does appear to be some element of profit taking amongst investors ahead of this afternoon\u2019s FOMC meeting. While today\u2019s ADP numbers play into the argument that a taper remains some way off, there is a chance that the Fed could well be less dovish in its statement than markets anticipate. Given that the Fed wrong footed the market at the last meeting no one wants to be caught out by an unexpected curve ball. Here's a good chart from StockTwits showing global central bank stimulus - from the Federal Reserve, Europan Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and Peoples Bank of China - at a record high. Unemployment is set to rise again in the US if the pace of jobs growth continues to erode, a top economist warned on Wednesday. My colleague Dominic Rushe writes: Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics and a former adviser to presidential candidate John McCain, made his comments as ADP, the giant payroll provider, said the private sector added 130,000 jobs from September to October. ADP revised September\u2019s job gain down from 166,000 to 145,000. Moody\u2019s helps compile the closely-watched poll. \"The government shutdown and debt limit brinksmanship hurt the already softening job market in October. Average monthly growth has fallen below 150,000. Any further weakening would signal rising unemployment,\u201d said Zandi. Here's Dominic's full report: US unemployment will rise unless jobs growth quickens, top economist warns Here's a look ahead to what the US Federal Reserve may say in its statement tonight, where reading the runes of the Fed's announcements is something of an art form. Nick Beecroft at Saxo Capital Markets said: There is a non-trivial chance that the Federal Open Markets Committee will downgrade its assessment of the economic situation in the first paragraph of its statement today. The last meeting\u2019s statement began thus: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. and Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen further and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Potential tweaks include a change from moderate to modest in the first sentence - a downgrade in assessment which it has employed previously. It would also be no surprise to see a more downbeat description applied to household spending. Last time, the second paragraph contained the following sentence: The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall,\u2026 This sentence surely needs revision in light of the government shutdown/debt ceiling headwinds, maybe even to the extent of the replacement of \u2018diminished\u2019 with \u2018increased\u2019, or a synonym thereof, and maybe, \u2018since the last meeting\u2019. Another sign the eurozone may be edging its way out of trouble came from Belgium, where GDP grew by 0.3% in the third quarter compared to the previous three months, and up 0.4% year on year. Philippe Ledent at ING said: Belgium is one of the first eurozone countries to deliver growth numbers for the third quarter. The number released today can be considered as good news, and our 0.1% growth estimate for 2013 becomes more and more likely. Having said that, the overall economic outlook remains quite uncertain and we don\u2019t expect any strong acceleration of growth in the near future. The number released today for Belgium is also a good sign for the whole of the Eurozone. As Belgium is a very open economy, it is likely that the Belgian activity benefited in the third quarter from positive growth in the neighbouring partners, and mainly Germany. Eugene Kaspersky's warning that the next big cyber attack may be on national infrastructures was apposite given that he made it in Dublin today, writes Henry McDonald. There is limited water supply at the Web Summit because of problems at one of the mai water plants that serve the Irish capital. Restrictions on mains water have been imposed after technical dificulties at the Ballymore Eustace plant in Co.Kildare which caused supply to drop by up to 25%. There is even the suggestion that recent heavy rain has made the reservoir water more difficult to treat at the plant. On Wall Street, markets are driftng higher as investors continue to bet that the US Federal Reserve will maintain its stimulus programme, especially given the disappointing jobs data earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 5 points in early trading while the S&amp;P 500 has added around 2 points. Not much of a move, but enough to keep European markets in positive territory. The FTSE 100 has been flirting with the May high of 6840 - if it surpasses that the index will be at its best level since December 1999 - but is currently up 0.07% at 6779.35. On the ADP jobs data itself, not only did the private sector add 130,000 jobs in October compared to an expected 150,000 but September's figure was revised down from 166,000 to 145,000. The figures came as the US government temporarily shut down over the political impasse on the budget. James Knightley at ING said: This [fall] reflects the government shutdown and debt default fears, which clearly made corporates reluctant to hire. Indeed, many private sector firms with government contracts will not have been paid and may have been forced to lay-off staff while those not with government contracts will presumably have been concerned about the possible economic damage and delayed hiring. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve Beige Book had suggested that \u201cuncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u201d made firms more cautious on hiring. This is not good news for the BLS employment report, which has been delayed until 8 November, suggesting that the labour market is losing momentum. As such this adds further weight to the case for a delay in Federal Reserve asset purchase tapering. And here is an update from Henry McDonald on the New York tech-stock exchange opening in Ireland (see 9.40). Enda Kenny rang the NASDAQ bell and made history as it was the first time the New York based tech-stock exchanged opened in Ireland. After opening the NASDAQ at the Web Summit, the Irish premier told his audience that Ireland had become a \"magnet for tech start ups\" over the last few years. He said the RDS arena was \"full of energy, full of young, skilled, passionate people\" who were driving the Irish tech industry. The Taoiseach said: \"We are the most open economy in the western world and we celebrate our pro business ethos and environment without hesitation....investment in Ireland is at record levels, business believes in Ireland. \" In a more heavily political aside, Kenny claimed his government had restored \"trust and integrity\" in Ireland throughout the world. Later he will help launch a raft of new job announcements in the hi-tech sector at event organised by the Republic's Industrial Development Authority. With that, I'm handing over to my coleague Nick Fletcher. The next cyberattack could look like Die Hard 4, putting vital infrastructure under threat. This is not Hollywood fantasy, but a real world risk, according to one of the world's leading experts in countering cybercrime, Eugene Kapersky. Henry McDonald spoke to Kapersky at the Dublin WebSummit. Here is his report: Eugene Karspersky, who built and owns the planet's largest cyber crime fighting lab based in Moscow, told the Guardian that the main threat to the economy and world security will be cyber-attacks on \"critical infrastructures\" such as power stations, national grids, factories and transport systems. \"I fear the next big attack in cyber space will be on critical infrastructures...if you have seen Die Hard 4 where this happens in the movie, it is no longer just Hollywood fantasy. It really could happen,\" he said. Kaspersky also said that the costs of cybercrime far outweighed experts' best estimates. \"The experts estimate that the damage from cybercrime to the global economy is estimated to be around 100 billion US dollars every year. That was said three years ago and I would guess it is far far in excess of that now. It's even worse today, it's times more that figure!\" Kaspersky said that he was rolling out a system with Microsoft across the world to teach children about cyber security and protection on the Internet. \"From two years old kids are learning about the Internet so for the rest of the world we need to teach kids how to behave in the networks. It's like we teach kids how to behave on the street, how to cross the street safely, not to trust everyone. It is ethical as well as technical and it is non profit. It's actually technical later, the ethical bit comes first.\" The price of gold has risen, after disappointing U.S jobs data (12.26) bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve would not cut its stimulus later today. Spot gold rose 1.1% to $1,358 per ounce, although has since dropped down a little. A weaker economy makes gold more appealing for investors. Jane Austen banknote controversies are becoming as common as ineligible suitors in her novels. Here is the latest: the Bank of England is under fire for choosing a \"saccharine picture\" of the author to put on the next \u00a310 note. This comes after the bank displeased Austen scholars by blundering with the quotation on the bills. Paula Byrne, a Jane Austen biographer, said the bank had made the \"supreme social satirist\" look like \"a really cost middle-class writer\". I think it is brilliant that she's on the note, it's just that it would have been better to show her as much more spiky, rather than suggest that she was a saccharine writer. Judge for yourself here and vote for 'smiling' or 'unsmiling' here. Here is a report on those ONS cost of living numbers (10.23) from the Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott: Households spending bigger share of income on fuel and other essentials The president of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso has told the United States to resolve its debt problems for the sake of its own credibility. In an interview with Reuters, Barroso said the battle between Republicans and Democrats over the debt ceiling was casting a shadow over the global economy. It is certainly an interesting role reversal, after several years of lectures from the Americans about Europe's debt crisis. Barroso also weighed in on the spying row, describing revelations of US spying on its European allies as \"a very big surprise\". Here are some of the key quotes: What is at stake is fundamental, not only for the American economy, but also for the credibility of the United States in the world. I hope that American democracy will work and will deliver what I think is critically important, not only for America but also for the world, because of the size and the impact of the American economy in the world. \"One of problems that (our) crisis highlighted, and a lesson we should draw, is the issue of confidence. We have a serious problem of confidence...Investors globally have been risk averse and this is not good for a scenario where we want globally to restore sustainable growth. Everything that casts a shadow over the confidence of investors is certainly not good, neither for the country concerned, in this case the United States, nor for the global economy. [On spying] It's a matter of the utmost sensitivity. We believe it should be addressed in a way that gives reassurances that can build trust between the United States and Europe,\" he said.\"There is no more important relationship for Europe than the relationship with the United States, and I also believe there is no more important relationship for the United States than the one it has with Europe. Hot off the press: new non-farm private sector jobs in the U.S grew at their lowest rate since April, according to a respected survey. The ADP national employment report shows that 130,000 jobs were created in October, compared to 145,000 jobs the previous month. Since hitting 190,000 jobs in June, job creation has been drifting downwards, with the US shutdown rattling people's nerves about the health of the economy. The governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has said he will use all the tools at his disposal to tackle uneven growth across the country. In an interview with the Western Mail, he said other parts of the country were not yet seeing the same pick-up in the economy as London. It is quite different across different parts of the United Kingdom and there isn\u2019t that momentum yet here in Wales, certainly nothing compared to what\u2019s happening in the centre of London. We\u2019re now better placed with a broader set of tools [so] that if there are imbalances that are building in some parts of the economy, whether it\u2019s a sector such as housing or some regions, we can to a degree help lean against those so that we don\u2019t use our broadest tool, which is monetary policy, to try to attack a specific issue in a specific part of the country but end up affecting other important regions and home nations such as Wales. Also worth noting that he rebutted the idea that the size of the public sector - a bogeyman for centre-right economists - might be holding back the recovery in Wales. The recovery is going to be driven by the private sector, whether it\u2019s in Wales or across the UK. I wouldn\u2019t characterise it as being held back by the public sector, it\u2019s a question of further expansion of the private sector. You can read the full interview here Earlier we reported on a surprise jump in German unemployment, via the German Statistics Agency (8.18). For the record, the Labour Office also has employment data out today, which tells the same story with a different set of figures. According to the Labour Office, the number of people out of work increased by 2,000 to 2.9m in September, the highest level since June 2011. This was worse than economists had forecast and will add to fears that Europe's largest economy is slowing down. The jobless rate held steady at 6.9%. But Anatoli Annenkov, senior economist at Societe Generale SA, told Bloomberg that things could get better. Survey indicators are weakening a bit and the big concern that we have is that even German companies are not investing that much....If we have continued growth in the third and fourth quarter, we can start to look forward to continued improvement in the labour market. Irish consumers are returning to the country's pubs again, according to company behind Magners and Bulmers cider. C&amp;C said sales volumes in bars had out-performed off-licences for the first time in seven years and reported a 7.9% increase in profit. Chief executive Stephen Glancey said new pubs were opening in Ireland after a difficult decade for the sector. The encouraging thing for us is that over the summer when the sun shone, that would normally send people back into the supermarkets to drink at home and have barbecues, and actually they went to the pub so it could well be the turning point. Having been bearish for two or three years on Ireland in terms of the economic cycle, we're bullish. The Irish consumer is certainly feeling a lot better. That's fundamentally very good news for us. Quotes from Reuters. The TUC has not been slow in responding to the ONS report, which shows the rising cost of essentials for households. Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary, says the government \"must wake up and start tackling the cost of living crisis\". Today\u2019s figures confirm that households are not benefitting from the recovery. Growth matters because it raises people\u2019s living standards. But this basic rule has been broken under an austerity-obsessed government. Most people will not feel as if we are in recovery if all the gains from growth are hogged by the same old elites, at the cost of ordinary families. The ONS report also shows the scale of our cost of living crisis, with people now having to spend more than a third of their incomes on essentials as they suffer the longest wage squeeze in over a century. The government must wake up and start tackling our cost of living crisis. It can start by taking on the excessive profits of the big energy firms that have pushed energy bills up so much that households are now spending more on gas and electricity than they are on filling up the car. Here are more highlights from the ONS survey, via Twitter: More evidence of the strain on UK household finances over the last few years, from the Office for National Statistics this morning. In its monthly economic review, the ONS draws attention to pressure on household budgets. Here are some of the headlines that have jumped out: The ONS finds \"little evidence of a sustained improvement in the economic position of households\",with Real Households\u2019 Disposable Income (RHDI) static since 2009, despite GDP growth of 4.2% over this period. Households are spending a higher proportion of their income on gas and electricity, 3.1% in 2013, compared t0 1.8% a decade ago. The cost of housing is also up significantly, swallowing just over fifth of household income, compared to 14.7% in 2003. The report also contains a reminder that while the economy is stronger, output is 2.6% below its 2007 peak, while manufacturing is 9% below its peak. Read the full ONS economic review here The big six energy firms face further accusations of ripping off customers and acting \"like a cartel\" from a smaller competitor, following yesterday's bruising encounter with MPs. Dale Vince, chief executive of Ecotricity, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, that wholesale costs alone could not justify the increase in bills. [The big six] have cited three factors: the rising cost of wholesale fossil fuels, government levies and the cost of distribution. All three of those are valid, in the case of wholesale price rises right now, if you look back over 12 months, then they are not justified in raising their retail prices because of wholesale movements in this year. Asked whether the firms were \"ripping us off\", he said: I think there's been a degree of that going on ever since privatisation back in the early '90s. Vince also rejected calls for an inquiry by the competition commission into the big six - as proposed by Tony Cocker of E.ON. I don't think you need an inquiry to tell you this market is dysfunctional, you just have to look at it. Six big players have a 95% market share and they seem to operate like a cartel, the prices go up in conjunction. Privatisation in the energy sector has simply failed. All quotes from PA A little bit of New York comes to Dublin today, with the opening of the NASDAQ stock exchange in the Irish capital. It won't all be razzmatazz. Ireland's prime minister will later face questions over the country's European bailouts and its low corporate tax rate. Here is this report from the Guardian's Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald: For the first time in its history the NASDAQ stock exchange will open up in Dublin later today. Ireland's prime minister Enda Kenny will ring the NASDAQ bell in the city's RDS conference centre as part of an international Web Summit taking place in the Irish capital. Up to 10,000 technology leaders, entrepreneurs and innovators are flocking to Dublin for the event which is estimated will inject \u20ac24 million into the city. Later today there will be a series of new job announcements and towards the close of play Kenny will be quizzed by the international media on the key questions over Ireland's economic future: the Republic expected exiting of the bail out from the IMF, EU and ECB rescue programme; the threat to the country's low corporation tax from Germany especially the Social Democrats who want the rate on the EU agenda as part of Coalition negotiations with Angela Merkel and another future international aid to prop up the state's still debt ridden banking system. It sounds like 2008 all over again, with banks being hit by a string of misconduct investigations. Today Barclays has revealed it is ensnared in the probe into rigging \u00a33 trillion a day currency markets, after regulators caught up with UBS and Deutsche Bank yesterday. The Guardian's city editor Jill Treanor writes that the investigations could be on the scale of the Libor scandal. In disclosing that it has received requests for information about its foreign exchange activities, Barclays is joining a number of other banks \u2013 including Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and UBS \u2013 admitting to cooperating with the authorities and also shedding light on the nature of the investigation that includes regulators in the UK, the US and Asia. Barclays said regulators were investigating foreign exchange trade trading \"including possible attempts to manipulate certain benchmark currency exchange rates or engage in other activities that would benefit their trading positions\". The investigations are at an early stage and could be on the scale of the Libor scandal, in which Barclays was the first bank to fined, in June 2012, with a penalty of \u00a3290m. That led to the departure of its chief executive, Bob Diamond, and the promotion of the retail banking head, Antony Jenkins, who has embarked on a strategy to restore the reputation of the bank. The full story: Barclays cooperating with investigation into manipulation of currency markets Another important set of data from the statistics agency shows that deflation has come to Spain, with the consumer price index running at -0.1% for June to September. Now its official: Spain's economy has grown again for the first time since 2011, according to data from the National Statistics Institute. Spain's gross domestic product grew by 0.1% between June and September, INE said, confirming last week's numbers from the Bank of Spain. No breakdown of the figures is so far available (in English), but according to Reuters' man in Madrid, the economy seems to have been helped by exports and a busy tourist season, as travellers stayed away from troubled regions in the Middle East and north Africa. None of this is likely to be much consolation to the millions out of work - Spain has an unemployment rate of 26%, one of the highest in Europe. Ben May of Capital Economics thinks that weak domestic demand is likely to hold back recovery. The upshot is that while economic prospects are considerably better than a year ago, particularly in the external sector, domestic weakness is like to hold back any recovery in the wider economy. We are pencilling in a below consensus 0.5% contraction in GDP next year. Based on this, we expect the unemployment rate to remain around its current high levels for some time yet and public debt to continue to climb. European markets have edged up this morning, on strong company results and expectations that the Fed will leave its stimulus programme unchanged. FTSE 100 + 0.44% at 6,804 points FTSEurofirst 300 +0.34% at 1,293 points CAC 40 +0.06% at 4,280 points Dax +0.11% at 9,031 points FTSE MIB +0,46% at 19,349 points German unemployment has jumped by 1.4% since last year, according to data from the Federal Statistics Office. The number of people in work was 42.1 million in September, the highest number since German reunification in 1990. But unemployment was 2.2 m in September, an increase of 28,000 people on last year. This leaves the unemployment rate at 5.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Investors are back on stimulus watch today, with the Federal Reserve expected to leave its $85 billion a month bond buying programme intact, when policymakers conclude their meeting today. With the exception of France's CAC 40, European markets opened slightly up this morning, after US indices hit record highs on Tuesday. The consensus is for no change at the Fed, although Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at Forex Markets, thinks that the status quo could still cause ripples in markets. Broadly unchanged Fed commentary may be seen as comparatively hawkish considering investors seem primed for a noticeable lurch toward the accommodative side of the spectrum. Plenty more is afoot today, with figures from Spain expected to confirm last week's data that the economy is growing for the first time since 2011. Figures just released show that German employment was steady in September. There are also lots of corporate results out this morning, with Barclays announcing a big jump in profits. I\u2019ll also be rounding up reactions to Tuesday\u2019s encounter between MPs and energy company bosses and tracking all the latest throughout the day...",

The FTSE 100 climbed as high as 6819, around 21 points shy of May's high and 22 off its best level since December 1999, buoyed by hopes the FED would continue its $85bn a month bond buying programme. Some caution set in, however, especially after poor ADP jobs figures for October raised further concerns about the state of the US economy, QE or no QE. In the end the FTSE 100 finished at 6777.70, up just 2.97 points. Retailers were in demand after upbeat results from Next. The high street and directories business reported better than expected third quarter sales up 4.3% and raised its full year profit guidance from \u00a3635m-\u00a3675m to \u00a3650m-\u00a3680m.

Pearson said its 2013 profits would be down on last year, partly due to weaker demand for textbooks from north American schools, while Standard Life's third quarter sales came short of expectations. But Tullow Oil saw its shares regain some ground after a poor couple of days. After temporarily suspended drilling operations in northern Kenya following local demonstrations, a field in the Norwegian Arctic where Tullow has a 20% stake came up with a dry well which will now be plugged and abandoned. But on Wednesday Tullow added 11p to 947p as Investec raised its rating on the group from sell to hold, saying the downside was limited in the near term. Petrofac put on 10p to \u00a314.78 as the oil and gas services business unveiled a $650m contract to extend the life of a gas field in Algeria, in partnership with Italy's Bonatti. AstraZeneca added 17.5p to \u00a333.30 ahead of its latest update due on Thursday, where analysts hope it may announce its new finance director. The current incumbent, Simon Lowth, will leave after the announcement of the third quarter results to become finance director of BG Group (which happens to report figures on the same day). Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou said the figures themselves could well beat expectations and the unveiling of a new finance director would also be a positive move. Among the mid-caps, Go-Ahead led the fallers, down 54p at \u00a316.84, but only because the shares went ex-dividend. Halfords was 2.6p higher at 415.4p after Barclays analysts raised their earnings forecasts and price target ahead of next week's first half results.

The biggest discounts?\" Subsidised Apple handsets could help lure customers onto a network whose speeds will shortly be fast enough to exploit the full potential of 4G handsets. 11 November is \"singles day\" in China, a popular holiday on which young people celebrate their bachelor life and organise blind date parties. Popularised since the advent of the internet, it has also become one of the biggest shopping days of the year, with \u00a32.4bn spent online last year according to McKinsey. A deal with China Mobile would mark a successful conclusion to a long-held ambition for Apple, whose revenues from one of the world's largest markets rose just 6% in the three months to 28 September compared with the same period last year. China already contributes \u00a35.7bn in revenue a quarter to Apple, not far behind the $8bn (\u00a35bn) earned from the entire European region, but the total could be much higher if Apple was to become one of the best selling smartphone brands in China. The latest iPhones, the 5S and 5C, have already been approved by the Chinese authorities for use on these faster networks. Both Apple and China Mobile declined to comment.",

      "standfirst": "Independence National Bank wants to compete with JP Morgan by investing millions into mobile tech. Will Americans log in?", 
      "body": "<p>Independence National Bank has a plan. The tiny Greenville, South Carolina-based bank, <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=IEBS\">with $115.6m in assets</a>, wants to be big on the internet.</p> <p>More specifically, Independence wants to be big in mobile banking \u2013 an option usually not available to tiny banks that barely make a speck in JP Morgan\u2019s shadow. Here\u2019s why the bank's CEO, Gordon Baird, thinks his investment in mobile banking will pay off: it\u2019s faster, cheaper and it will tell his customers immediately how much money they have, which may help them budget better. And the most important reason: in a world where the big boys in banking seem to get all the profits (and all the bailouts), moving to mobile banking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/03/small-banks-tarp-bailout-survive\">may help his little bank survive</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that technology \u2013 some that we are developing on our own, as well as others that will soon be available on the market \u2013 can help community banks thrive and even compete with the larger more sophisticated institutions, both on cost as well as functionality,\u201d says Baird.</p> <p>It\u2019s a big bet to move into mobile banking, and one that costs more than small-town money. Independence just hired two big tech dealmakers, former Verizon Wireless executives Aditya Khurjekar and Humphrey Chen, to move to South Carolina and help build its mobile technology and banking capabilities, <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/correcting-and-replacing-independence-bancshares-expands-senior-executive-team-2013-09-24\">after they helped grow Verizon\u2019s 4G business</a>.</p> <p>Independence is spending $1.26m this year on its foray into mobile banking<strong>;</strong> the little bank just committed about <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1311828/000114544313001654/d30522_10q.htm\">$615,000 more to its expansion into the mobile banking business</a>. So far, Independence\u2019s mobile banking technology, which it plans to launch by the end of 2014's first quarter, costs the equivalent of 1.6% of the bank\u2019s assets. For JP Morgan and Citigroup \u2013 which, admittedly, have been in the game longer \u2013<br> <a href=\"http://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/data/qer213s.pdf?ieNocache=256\">technology spending</a>&#xa0;amounts to only about 0.1% of their assets this year.</p> <p>It\u2019s ambitious, but it\u2019s also an ambition Independence shares with many other banks. Mobile banking is the next hot thing, a way for banks to show that they\u2019re striding confidently into the 21st century. According to <a href=\"http://www.americanbanker.com/magazine/123_3/follow-the-money-banks-to-spend-more-on-mobile-1057689-1.html\">spending forecasts for the year</a>, consumer banks are increasing their information technology to $45.7bn, up 3.3% from 2012. The majority of the banks, or 57%, say that the increases will be dedicated to mobile banking, and another 46% are spending that money on online banking.</p> <p>This is a sea change in what we think of as community banking. Community banks have long said that their strength is in personal relationships, that customers would rather have an account with someone they know. John Buhrmaster, President of First National Bank in Scotia, New York, says online banking helps customers keep their community bank accounts, even when they move away, and parents open accounts for their college-age children. As Buhrmaster catchily puts it, \u201cWhen something goes wrong, who would you rather deal with: a 1-800 number or your community banker?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a good slogan, and Baird reinforces the point with hopes that mobile banking will increase foot traffic in his bank\u2019s three branches. The only problem is that it rarely works out that way, or at least hasn\u2019t so far. There\u2019s no denying, industry-wide, that mobile banking often displaces face-to-face relationships.</p> <p>Thanks to online banking, bank branches are less important, says<a href=\"http://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/wheelock/\"> David Wheelock</a>, vice-president and deputy director of research at the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank. Banks close more branches as they herd their customers online, explained Nancy Bush, an analyst at SNL Financial. <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/25/pf/banks-online-mobile-banking/index.html\">According to research by SNL</a>, 2012 saw a nationwide loss of 1,118 branches, as banks closed 2,267 branches and opened only 1,149. Bank of America alone closed 256 branches while only opening 12.</p> <p>For the big boys, the bet on mobile banking is paying off. Their growth numbers in mobile users look more like what you\u2019d expect from a hot social media startup than a place where people stash their savings.</p> <p>Here\u2019s JP Morgan Chase <a href=\"http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ONE/2724848264x0x652147/a734543b-03fa-468d-89b0-fa5a9b1d9e5f/JPMC_2012_AR.pdf\">crowing in its recent annual report</a> about its mobile progress:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAt the end of 2011, Chase had 8.2 million 90-day active mobile users. At year-end 2012, we had 12.4 million active mobile users, a 51% increase in only 12 months. Today, we\u2019re growing mobile users by roughly 350,000 a month.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a reason that banks as divergent as Independence and JP Morgan are chasing online apps. A report, released last month by <a href=\"http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Online-banking.aspx\">the Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American Life Project</a>, found that 51% of American adults bank online. A smaller fraction of them, 32%, bank using their mobile phones.</p> <p>For all the maudlin tributes to the warmth and power of community banking, most Americans seem to like their transactions digital. In fact, in 2012, the most common banking activities, like paying bills, viewing balances/statements and transferring money, are <a href=\"http://www.forrester.com/The+State+Of+North+American+Digital+Banking+Priorities+Goals+And+Metrics/fulltext/-/E-RES75382?objectid=RES75382\">being conducted online about 60% of the time, found Forrester Research</a>.</p> <p>The only activity that seemed to still take place at an actual bank location was depositing a check, with 70% of check deposits still done in person. Banks are hunting that down too: Citibank, Charles Schwab, Chase and Bank of America all offer mobile deposits.</p> <p>It\u2019s all well and good when it\u2019s about fees \u2013 and cutting costs \u2013 but in the world with hackers around every corner, banks are not totally secure. They still have to work on mobile security, because, as with the banks themselves, that\u2019s where the money is.</p> <p>\"The financial services industry is one of the more attractive targets for cyber attacks, and, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323808204579083350661570962\">unfortunately, the threat is growing</a>,\" said Thomas Curry, comptroller of the currency, in September. His office launched an effort <a href=\"http://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2013/nr-occ-2013-96.html\">to help banks strengthen their defenses</a>.</p> <p>Consumers are also reasonably wary of the risks of banking online or with their mobile devices. A survey conducted by the Federal Reserve found that 49% of consumers did not use mobile banking in 2012 due to security reasons. Among their concerns were hackers, losing their mobile device, and data interception by a third party; when <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/consumers-and-mobile-financial-services-report-201303.pdf\">the Federal Reserve surveyed consumers</a>, 44% said their concerns included \u201call of the above\u201d.</p> <p>Still, Baird remains optimistic. If handled correctly, he believes that small banks can come out of \u201cthe transition to a more digital world\u201d as winners.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Independence National Bank has a plan. The tiny Greenville, South Carolina-based bank, with $115.6m in assets, wants to be big on the internet. More specifically, Independence wants to be big in mobile banking \u2013 an option usually not available to tiny banks that barely make a speck in JP Morgan\u2019s shadow. Here\u2019s why the bank's CEO, Gordon Baird, thinks his investment in mobile banking will pay off: it\u2019s faster, cheaper and it will tell his customers immediately how much money they have, which may help them budget better. And the most important reason: in a world where the big boys in banking seem to get all the profits (and all the bailouts), moving to mobile banking may help his little bank survive. \u201cWe believe that technology \u2013 some that we are developing on our own, as well as others that will soon be available on the market \u2013 can help community banks thrive and even compete with the larger more sophisticated institutions, both on cost as well as functionality,\u201d says Baird. It\u2019s a big bet to move into mobile banking, and one that costs more than small-town money. Independence just hired two big tech dealmakers, former Verizon Wireless executives Aditya Khurjekar and Humphrey Chen, to move to South Carolina and help build its mobile technology and banking capabilities, after they helped grow Verizon\u2019s 4G business. Independence is spending $1.26m this year on its foray into mobile banking; the little bank just committed about $615,000 more to its expansion into the mobile banking business. So far, Independence\u2019s mobile banking technology, which it plans to launch by the end of 2014's first quarter, costs the equivalent of 1.6% of the bank\u2019s assets. For JP Morgan and Citigroup \u2013 which, admittedly, have been in the game longer \u2013 technology spending amounts to only about 0.1% of their assets this year. It\u2019s ambitious, but it\u2019s also an ambition Independence shares with many other banks. Mobile banking is the next hot thing, a way for banks to show that they\u2019re striding confidently into the 21st century. According to spending forecasts for the year, consumer banks are increasing their information technology to $45.7bn, up 3.3% from 2012. The majority of the banks, or 57%, say that the increases will be dedicated to mobile banking, and another 46% are spending that money on online banking. This is a sea change in what we think of as community banking. Community banks have long said that their strength is in personal relationships, that customers would rather have an account with someone they know. John Buhrmaster, President of First National Bank in Scotia, New York, says online banking helps customers keep their community bank accounts, even when they move away, and parents open accounts for their college-age children. As Buhrmaster catchily puts it, \u201cWhen something goes wrong, who would you rather deal with: a 1-800 number or your community banker?\u201d It\u2019s a good slogan, and Baird reinforces the point with hopes that mobile banking will increase foot traffic in his bank\u2019s three branches. The only problem is that it rarely works out that way, or at least hasn\u2019t so far. There\u2019s no denying, industry-wide, that mobile banking often displaces face-to-face relationships. Thanks to online banking, bank branches are less important, says David Wheelock, vice-president and deputy director of research at the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank. Banks close more branches as they herd their customers online, explained Nancy Bush, an analyst at SNL Financial. According to research by SNL, 2012 saw a nationwide loss of 1,118 branches, as banks closed 2,267 branches and opened only 1,149. Bank of America alone closed 256 branches while only opening 12. For the big boys, the bet on mobile banking is paying off. Their growth numbers in mobile users look more like what you\u2019d expect from a hot social media startup than a place where people stash their savings. Here\u2019s JP Morgan Chase crowing in its recent annual report about its mobile progress: \u201cAt the end of 2011, Chase had 8.2 million 90-day active mobile users. At year-end 2012, we had 12.4 million active mobile users, a 51% increase in only 12 months. Today, we\u2019re growing mobile users by roughly 350,000 a month.\" There\u2019s a reason that banks as divergent as Independence and JP Morgan are chasing online apps. A report, released last month by the Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American Life Project, found that 51% of American adults bank online. A smaller fraction of them, 32%, bank using their mobile phones. For all the maudlin tributes to the warmth and power of community banking, most Americans seem to like their transactions digital. In fact, in 2012, the most common banking activities, like paying bills, viewing balances/statements and transferring money, are being conducted online about 60% of the time, found Forrester Research. The only activity that seemed to still take place at an actual bank location was depositing a check, with 70% of check deposits still done in person. Banks are hunting that down too: Citibank, Charles Schwab, Chase and Bank of America all offer mobile deposits. It\u2019s all well and good when it\u2019s about fees \u2013 and cutting costs \u2013 but in the world with hackers around every corner, banks are not totally secure. They still have to work on mobile security, because, as with the banks themselves, that\u2019s where the money is. \"The financial services industry is one of the more attractive targets for cyber attacks, and, unfortunately, the threat is growing,\" said Thomas Curry, comptroller of the currency, in September. His office launched an effort to help banks strengthen their defenses. Consumers are also reasonably wary of the risks of banking online or with their mobile devices. A survey conducted by the Federal Reserve found that 49% of consumers did not use mobile banking in 2012 due to security reasons. Among their concerns were hackers, losing their mobile device, and data interception by a third party; when the Federal Reserve surveyed consumers, 44% said their concerns included \u201call of the above\u201d. Still, Baird remains optimistic. If handled correctly, he believes that small banks can come out of \u201cthe transition to a more digital world\u201d as winners.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays is involved in the new investigation by global regulators into the potential manipulation of the \u00a33tn-a-day currency markets, in a fresh setback for the bank as it attempts to clean up its reputation in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal. As it published its third quarter financial results, Barclays disclosed that it has received official requests for information about its foreign exchange activities. Barclays is joining a number of other banks \u2013 including Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and UBS \u2013 in co-operating with the authorities and also shedding light on the nature of the investigation by regulators in the UK, the US and Asia. RBS said it was already reviewing its processes in the foreign exchange markets. Barclays also confirmed it is continuing to contest a \u00a350m penalty from the Financial Conduct Authority for behaving recklessly in the way it raised funds from Qatar to avoid a taxpayer bailout in 2008. The foreign exchange investigations are at an early stage and could be on the scale of the Libor scandal. Barclays was the first bank to be fined for rigging the key interest-rate benchmark, in June 2012, and was handed a fine of \u00a3290m. That led to the departure of its chief executive, Bob Diamond, and the promotion of Antony Jenkins, who has since embarked on a strategy to restore the reputation of the bank through his so-called transform programme. Jenkins used the results to outline a vision for more technology at the bank \u2013 which, it is suggested, could lead to 40,000 job cuts \u2013 and said that he was embarking on a new review of the bank's 75 business lines to gauge the riskiness of the operations. Last month the bank was forced to tap shareholders for \u00a36bn to bolster its financial strength. Jenkins said the new finance director Tushar Morzaria, who joined a fortnight ago, would reassess each business line to assess how much capital they are using. He refused to elaborate on the bank's legal disclosure that regulators are investigating foreign exchange trading \"including possible attempts to manipulate certain benchmark currency exchange rates or engage in other activities that would benefit their trading positions\". The bank said: \"The investigations appear to involve multiple market participants in various countries. Barclays has received enquiries from certain of these authorities related to their particular investigations, is reviewing its foreign exchange trading covering a several-year period through August 2013 and is co-operating with the relevant authorities in their investigations.\" The investigations emerged after reports of allegations that traders at major banks were putting in client orders before a 60-second window when benchmarks run by WM/Reuters \u2013 and used by fund managers to value their investments \u2013 are set. Jenkins said his new team \u2013 as well as a new finance director, he has a new retail head and new bosses of the investment bank \u2013 needed to \"push harder\" in the final quarter of the year and into 2014. After being forced into the cash call by the Bank of England, Jenkins said the bank was continuing to \"reassess the balance sheet for further leverage reduction opportunities consistent with preserving our strong franchises, supporting lending to the UK economy\". When he took the helm he had originally assessed 75 business lines in terms of reputation risks and said he would withdraw from some businesses. The investment bank \u2013 the traditional powerhouse of the business and once known as Barclays Capital \u2013 took a hit to income as a result and also suffered a fall in its fixed-income trading. Third quarter profits in the investment bank fell 53% to \u00a3463m, although the bank did not disclose any reduction caused by shutting down the controversial tax planning department known as structured capital markets. Overall, in the third quarter, profits fell to \u00a31.4bn from \u00a31.9bn as losses in continental Europe widened. In the first nine months of the year Barclays's profits rose to \u00a32.8bn from \u00a3962m, although this included the cost of buying back its own debt. The shares rose 3.5% to 274p in early trading. Barclays is in discussions with its shareholders about ways to avoid an EU cap on bonuses being introduced by the EU at the start of next year by introducing a new allowance for its highest paid staff. It said the closely-watched compensation to income ratio at its investment bank \u2013 measuring what proportion of its income it was paying out to its staff \u2013 had risen to 41% from 40% and remains above its target of 35%. Foreign exchange Regulators are investigating whether traders used advance knowledge of customer orders in the \u00a33tn a day currency markets to make money for their banks' own accounts when using a benchmark known as WM/Reuters. It is regarded as the nearest thing to a closing price in a 24-hour, self-regulated market where currencies are traded between professionals at top banks. The WM/Reuters rate is set at 4pm London time is considered the benchmark by many companies and investors because more than 40% of daily global foreign exchange trading is conducted in London. To calculate the benchmark, WM takes the median of actual trades and order rates during a one minute \"fix\" period. The rates are set hourly, or every 30 minutes for active currencies, and cover some 160 currencies. Regulators are investigating whether traders pushed through trades around the one minute window when the benchmarks are set to try and influence them. Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, UBS and Barclays are the four biggest players in the global foreign exchange market with a combined share of more than 50%.",
