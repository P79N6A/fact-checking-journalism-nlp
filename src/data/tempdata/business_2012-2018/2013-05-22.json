      "bodyText": "Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, the last remnant of a telecoms empire that once employed 54,000 people around the world, is to leave the UK. After 140 years as a British company, CWC is relocating its headquarters from Holborn in central London to southern Florida, transferring about 100 jobs to the United States. CWC will keep its London listing, but the remaining UK ties of a company that was built to connect the far-flung regions of the British empire have been gradually severed. In 2010 the firm was demerged from its UK network, which was placed in a separately listed company, Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide. That business was bought by Vodafone last year. More recently CWC has sold its networks in the Channel Islands, the Falklands and the Isle of Man so that it can focus on operations in Panama and its Caribbean stronghold. The Bahraini national carrier Batelco has bought the British isles operations, as well as those in the Maldives and Seychelles, and is in talks to acquire CWC's Monaco business. As part of its retrenchment to the pan-American region, CWC has also disposed of its Macau network, selling it to Citic Telecom for $750m (\u00a3490m). Chief executive Tony Rice, who has overseen the transformation, will make the move to Florida, where the preferred locations are currently Miami or Fort Lauderdale. \"The group is now focused on a single region with low penetration for data services and strong growth potential where we have scale and market leadership,\" said Rice. \"This focus will create a more unified, effective and cost-efficient group.\" Assembled from a number of British telegraph companies founded in the 1860s, Cable &amp; Wireless was merged with the Marconi operations in the 1930s and nationalised shortly after the second world war as the government sought to exercise closer control of key strategic assets. In 1981 it became the first company to be privatised under Margaret Thatcher, and was later the first UK operator to offer an alternative telephone service to British Telecom, via its subsidiary Mercury Communications. Poor investments slowly whittled away the group's scale. During the dotcom boom chunks of the family silver were sold, including the One2One mobile phone business (now T-Mobile). Some \u00a35bn of the proceeds were put into creating a web-traffic carrier by buying internet companies, mainly in the US. The idea was ahead of its time. Without traffic to fill the brand new fibre networks, price-cutting became ferocious. In 2003 the firm rang up a loss of \u00a36.4bn, from revenues of \u00a34.4bn. The Caribbean, where Cable &amp; Wireless was on many islands a monopoly provider, was the only part of the business still making a significant profit. CWC now makes $586m in revenues in Panama and $1.12bn a year from the Caribbean. Its Monaco business generates $236m a year in revenues. Announcing full-year results on Wednesday, Rice said further job cuts over the coming two years would help create $100m a year of savings.",

Investors, however, became more cautious on Wednesday afternoon and the markets fell after the release of the minutes from the Fed's last meeting showed some committee members were prepared to start cutting back the size of the programme as early as June if the recovery continues. Bernanke warned Washington's deep spending cuts were holding back the recovery. \"Conditions in the job market have shown some improvement recently,\" he said. \"Despite this improvement, the job market remains weak overall: The unemployment rate is still well above its longer-run normal level, rates of long-term unemployment are historically high, and the labor force participation rate has continued to move down. Moreover, nearly 8 million people are working part time even though they would prefer full-time work.\" Bernanke acknowledging that historically low interest rates and the Fed's huge government bond buying programme had costs but he said \"a premature tightening of monetary policy could lead interest rates to rise temporarily but also would carry a substantial risk of slowing or ending the economic recovery.\" Republican congressman Kevin Brady questioned Bernanke about his exit strategy from quantitative easing. \"My worry is the Fed doesn't have the prescription for what ails our economy,\" he said. Bernanke acknowledged the recovery had been slow but said it had faced \"significant headwinds\" including deep government spending cuts. He said it was \"not responsible to focus all of the restraint on the very near term\" and urged Congress to replace some of its fiscal tightening with measures to restrain long-term healthcare and social security costs. The Fed chairman was asked whether monetary policy might create new bubbles. Senator Pat Toomey said he was concerned about recent spikes in the housing market, farm land prices and junk bonds. \"I don't disagree that this is not easy,\" said Bernanke. \"There is no risk free strategy here.\" Bernanke said he was particularly concerned about the recession's continuing impact on the long-term unemployed. In April, there were 4.4m long-term unemployed people in the US \u2013 those jobless for 27 weeks or more \u2013 according to the Labor Department. Their share of the unemployed declined by 2.2 percentage points to 37.4%. The levels remained a \"significant concern\", said Bernanke. \"We are seeing evidence that employers are reluctant to look at people if they have been out of work for a long time,\" he said. But he said he believed it was not an \"irreversible problem\". Speculation has been rising that the Fed might be preparing to taper off its bond purchases and some Fed members have called for the policy to be reassessed. Bernanke said the Fed would consider to monitor the situation and would taper off the programme \"as the economic outlook improves\". But he said a wind-down would not be an \"automatic, mechanistic process\". \"All things considered, we still think that the Fed will begin to curb its asset purchases before the end of the year, with a complete halt sometime in the first half of next year,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.",

The UK helped create the EITI in 2002 and has subsequently funded it, but since the UK was not defined as a \"resource-rich\" country by the International Monetary Fund, the UK did not feel it necessary to join, even after Barack Obama said the US would join in 2011. Under the initiative, annual reports publish what tax was paid by oil and mineral companies in a country, and the national government publishes what it received. The report is prepared to an international standard overseen by an independent body. The two sums are then reconciled and any gap can be often be attributed to corruption. The move also strengthens the powers of the legislature of countries since they have clearer information on what their executives have received. The current chair of the EITI is Clare Short, the former international development secretary. In a weekend interview she said: \"This is billions and billions and it far outweighs anything that goes across the world in aid. If these monies were properly managed and properly invested and used, hundreds of millions, literally, of people could see a better life. At the moment there's great riches but they're not lifting up the people in poor countries that have become the target of mining and oil investment in this commodity boom in the way that they should.\" She said: \"You can't force countries, but if a country won't reform and in the worst case that you talk about where you've got a kleptocracy that really is running away with the money, no one can make them change unless they want to. \"But the EITI does leverage change in improvement in some of the countries with really serious problems.\" In Washington last week, David Cameron the current chair of the G8 leading economies, called for more openness among energy companies, claiming a veil of secrecy obscures the conduct of the extractive industries. He announced an urgent review into Britain's failure to join the regime, saying: \"We cannot call on other countries to live up to these high standards if we are not prepared to do so ourselves.\" The US Securities and Exchange Commission ruled last year that oil and natural gas companies must disclose payments to foreign governments. At present there are 39 countries involved with the initiative and 23 that are fully compliant.",

      "bodyText": "Financier George Soros has led a \u00a350m investment in fibre-optic company Hyperoptic, which lays high-speed lines direct to UK homes. The funding, from the Soros investment vehicle Quantum Strategic Parters, will help Hyperoptic reach its target of 500,000 homes within the next five years. Its \"hyperfast\" lines transmit information at 1 gigabit per second, which is more than 80 times the UK broadband average of 12 megabits per second, and the company has already reached 20,000 homes in London. Hyperoptic plans to bring its service to 10 additional cities by the end of the year, with locations driven by demand from consumers. As part of the investment, two directors from Soros Fund Management, Waldemar Szlezak and Joshua Ho-Walker, are joining the Hyperoptic board. Soros, best known for currency trading, has more recently made a series of telecoms investments, from mobile towers in Africa to backing Irish entrepreneur Denis O'Brien's bid to run a network in Burma. Hyperoptic was founded in 2010 by entrepreneurs Boris Ivanovic and Dana Tobak, who created the UK internet service provider Be, which was sold to the O2 mobile network for \u00a350m in 2006, and is now part of BSkyB. While BT is installing fibre to street cabinets across the country, it relies on copper from cabinet to the home, which can reduce speeds. Fewer than 1% of UK premises are directly plugged into fibre lines, according to the Fibre to the Home Council Europe, compared with 50% in Japan and 10% in the United States.",

Hyperoptic plans to bring its service to 10 additional cities by the end of the year, with locations driven by demand from consumers.</p> <p>As part of the investment, two directors from Soros Fund Management, Waldemar Szlezak and Joshua Ho-Walker, are joining the Hyperoptic board. Soros, best known for currency trading, has more recently made a series of telecoms investments, from mobile towers in Africa to backing Irish entrepreneur Denis O'Brien's bid to run a network in Burma.</p> <p>Hyperoptic was founded in 2010 by entrepreneurs Boris Ivanovic and Dana Tobak, who created the UK internet service provider Be, which was sold to the O2 mobile network for \u00a350m in 2006, and is now part of BSkyB.</p> <p>While BT is installing fibre to street cabinets across the country, it relies on copper from cabinet to the home, which can reduce speeds. Fewer than 1% of UK premises are directly plugged into fibre lines, according to the Fibre to the Home Council Europe, compared with 50% in Japan and 10% in the United States.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares Morrisons were one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE100 Wednesday as it emerged that a major shareholder had dumped its stake in the Bradford-based supermarket chain. Walter Scott, a fund management group run by a former nuclear physicist, sold about 100m shares, equivalent to just over 4% of Morrisons' stock, for a total \u00a3280m, a slight discount to Wednesday's closing share price of 283p \u2013 down 2.5%. The Edinburgh-based investment manager is the second big shareholder to ditch its holdings in Morrisons this year after fund manager BlackRock sold down its 10% stake between January and March. A member of the Morrisons founding family also cashed in shares this year. The firm's largest shareholder remains Threadneedle, part of Ameriprise, followed by Invesco, which snapped up a large chunk of BlackRock's stake. The latest share sale comes days after Morrisons signed a 25-year contract to sell groceries online in partnership with specialist retailer Ocado. The chain will use Ocado's technology and distribution network but retain the Morrisons banner for the website and deliveries. Mike Dennis at Cantor Fitzgerald said: \"We see this placing and the family selling stock as a clear indication in the lack of credibility in the current strategy and an endorsement of our view that falling return on capital employed and strategic mistakes will lead to further profit disappointments.\" Morrisons' chief executive, Dalton Philips, said the Ocado deal would put the supermarket group \"into the fast lane\" of the fast-growing online grocery market where the company trails far behind rivals such as Tesco and Sainsbury's. But some analysts believe Morrisons has paid too high a price to use Ocado's facilities which will not give it sufficient capacity to deliver rapid growth. The company has agreed to invest more than \u00a3200m in the online retailer's second warehouse, in Warwickshire, which it will lease back to Ocado, and will pay a fee equivalent to 1% of sales from Morrisons.com. The warehouse provides the opportunity to add about \u00a3500m of sales over the next five years. Clive Black at Shore Capital said after the deal: \"For Morrison we see this as a potential waste of capital that does not yet credibly lead to a profitable grocery online business.\"",

Hence when it came out as merely \u201ccritical\u201d, the report can be dutifully hailed again as a ringing endorsement of government policy.</p> <p>Article IVs are almost never directly critical of large countries like the UK, and they are always hedged in careful diplomatic language. Nevertheless the message is clear enough if you can read the runes</p> </blockquote> <p>And that message, as we've been banging on about since David Lipton's press conference, is more infrastructure spending. <strong>Now</strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bottom line is that the IMF is endorsing an increase in public investment spending, as many of us have been pushing for years. The most effective way to address deficient demand would be for the government to directly spend at least \u00a320bn on infrastructure over the next two years, as analysed in studies by the&#xa0;Institute for Fiscal Studies,&#xa0;National Institute for Economic and Social Research&#xa0;and LSE\u2019s&#xa0;Centre for Economic Performance, and the IMF now seem to agree.</p> <p>I wish the IMF could have been even more critical of the failures of the government\u2019s fiscal plans. They are too willing to accept the argument that \u201ccredibility\u201d has been purchased by an excessively front-loaded deficit reduction plan, for example.</p> <p>But it is clear that the chancellor\u2019s (formerly?) favourite international think tank has signed up to the public investment programme we so sorely need.

      "bodyText": "The last word today goes to our economics editor, Larry Elliott. Hit the austerity pause button. Invest more in social housing, schools and road repairs. Growth is more important in the short term than deficit reduction. Couched in suitably polite language, that was the uncomfortable message from the International Monetary Fund to George Osborne today. The chancellor could take some comfort from the fact that the Fund was rather more diplomatic about his economic strategy than it was in Washington a month ago, but not all that much. For the past couple of weeks, the Government has done its utmost to persuade the IMF that Britain should stick to its current budgetary course. Osborne has tried. The chief secretary Danny Alexander has tried. Sir Mervyn King has tried. They have all failed. Larry's full analysis will be online tonight. That's all for today. This post from 2.33pm sums up the key points from the IMF report. Thanks. GW Sky News's Ed Conway makes the case tonight that the IMF's call for the government to adjust its fiscal programme is \"arguably...the least interesting part of all\". He writes: The Fund believes Britain\u2019s banking system remains in some trouble. It believes the Government may have to pump extra cash into the semi-nationalised banks, RBS and Llloyds. These are more intriguing criticisms; ones the Government would be wrong to ignore. And yet it is \u201cPlan A\u201d and \u201cPlan B\u201d that hog the headlines. One can understand why: the Chancellor made key pledges on the deficit, on which it is far easier to judge him than on the complex world of financial reform. But, in the grand scheme of things, the IMF making vague micro-suggestions about his fiscal plans simply isn\u2019t a rift of the scale some would like it to be. This might interest regular eurozone watchers -- Citi, the investment bank, has dropped its prediction that Greece will leave the eurozone next year. Looking back at the IMF report again. John Van Reenen, director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the LSE, argues that Britain's civil servants have played a blinder over the IMF report: The Treasury\u2019s spin doctors have been working overtime ever since to say the IMF Article IV was likely to be very critical of the government due to internal politics. Hence when it came out as merely \u201ccritical\u201d, the report can be dutifully hailed again as a ringing endorsement of government policy. Article IVs are almost never directly critical of large countries like the UK, and they are always hedged in careful diplomatic language. Nevertheless the message is clear enough if you can read the runes And that message, as we've been banging on about since David Lipton's press conference, is more infrastructure spending. Now. The bottom line is that the IMF is endorsing an increase in public investment spending, as many of us have been pushing for years. The most effective way to address deficient demand would be for the government to directly spend at least \u00a320bn on infrastructure over the next two years, as analysed in studies by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, National Institute for Economic and Social Research and LSE\u2019s Centre for Economic Performance, and the IMF now seem to agree. I wish the IMF could have been even more critical of the failures of the government\u2019s fiscal plans. They are too willing to accept the argument that \u201ccredibility\u201d has been purchased by an excessively front-loaded deficit reduction plan, for example. But it is clear that the chancellor\u2019s (formerly?) favourite international think tank has signed up to the public investment programme we so sorely need. So perhaps we will finally get some real action. The European Council has now released the conclusions of today's meeting in Brussels, which include a new agreement to fight tax evasion. Here's the key section from the official summary: Tax fraud and tax evasion limit countries' capacity to raise revenue and carry out their economic policies. In times of tight budgetary constraints, combating tax fraud and tax evasion is more than an issue of tax fairness - it becomes essential for the political and social acceptability of fiscal consolidation. The European Council agreed to accelerate work in the fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning. In particular, work will be taken forward as a matter of priority on promoting and broadening the scope of the automatic exchange of information at all levels. Back in the financial markets, and the FTSE 100 index has closed at a new 13-year high, and Germany's DAX hit its highest ever level. Ben Bernanke's testimony on Capitol Hill, in which he said it was too early to tighten monetary policy (see 3.28pm) gave the markets another sugar rush. Down the corridor in Brussels, Angela Merkel has told reporters that EU leaders are determined to stop large companies from paying too little tax in countries where they operate. Reuters reports: The European Union will ensure big companies pay more taxes in the countries where they are based, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday. \"We will work towards ensuring companies have to pay more where they are based,\" she said in Brussels at the end of an EU summit, adding that this would affect big companies most. Merkel also told reporters that leaders had make significant progress by agreeing to prevent banks keeping savings information secret. EU leaders did not discuss whether they should harmonise their corporate tax rates to combat companies who base themselves in low-taxation juristictions, Van Rompuy said: We have discussed tax fraud, and tax evasion... Where there is harmful tax competition there are instruments to deal with this. Van Rompuy adds that more work needs to be done to address instances of \"aggressive tax planning\", and companies taking advantage of loopholes. In Brussels, president Herman Van Rompuy is telling the press conference that the European Council understands the importance on doing more to fight tax evasion. Other press conferences are also taking place, so we should hear from other leaders soon \u2013 including David Cameron. We've not done much on Europe today, with all the IMF action in Britain. But over in Brussels, a press conference is just getting underway following the Council of Europe meeting. It's being streamed here. Do you think the IMF has pulled its punches on the UK, or are today's recommendations as hard-hitting as before? Have your say in this poll. The IMF sums up its recommentations as: U.K. Should Restore Growth, Rebalance Economy, in a summary of today's report on its site. It's topline bulletpoints are: Some signs of an uptick in growth, but still far from strong, sustainable recovery Financial policies should ensure monetary easing reaches broader economy Fiscal, structural policies to boost expectations of incomes and investment returns Back to the IMF's report into the UK. David Lipton has been expanding on the Fund's recommendation that infrastructure spending should be brought forward. He's told Channel Four News that the government would improve its fiscal position in the long term by adjusting its tax and spending policy today: Faisal Islam has written the quotes up on his blog: Lipton said: \u201cLooking at this, it seems clear the country needs infrastructure, and since it needs it eventually this seems the right time to be intensifying the infrastructure effort. Doing it now when the impact would be very substantial seems like a wise course of action. Yes this is fiscal policy \u2013 it would require the Government to advance some of its current spending plans \u2013 to us seems like a strategy that would help the economy and not damage fiscal sustainability because of its contribution to growth. In long run it would leave the fiscal situation better,\u201d he told me. And when asked if this was a \u201cPlan B\u201d, Lipton added: \u201cNo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Plan B. What we see is the need always to take into account of the impact of policies and their results and making corrections along the way\u201d. But when he asked him if the UK should borrow a little more now in order to borrow less in future, he said: \u201cI think the point is that having a slightly different path of adjustment, we think, would strengthen the economy because some of the spending would be high impact\u201d. In the financial markets, shares are rallying after the head of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, said it was too early to tighten monetary policy in America. The FTSE 100 has leapt 67 points to 6870, up almost 1%, putting the blue chip index on track for a new 13-year high. The Dow Jones index has also posted similar gains, up 131 points at 15518. Once again, share prices are benefting because the world economy is too weak to allow central bankers to halt quantitative easing, let alone raise interest rates. The IMF's report into the UK also recommended \"accomodative monetary policy\", including the possibility of additional quantitative easing in Britain too. Bernanke's testimony is online here: Here's the key paragraph: Recognizing the drawbacks of persistently low rates, the FOMC* actively seeks economic conditions consistent with sustainably higher interest rates.Unfortunately, withdrawing policy accommodation at this juncture would be highly unlikely to produce such conditions. A premature tightening of monetary policy could lead interest rates to rise temporarily but would also carry a substantial risk of slowing or ending the economic recovery and causing inflation to fall further. Such outcomes tend to be associated with extended periods of lower, not higher, interest rates, as well as poor returns on other assets. Moreover, renewed economic weakness would pose its own risks to financial stability. * Federal Open Market Committee, which sets US monetary policy More reaction to the IMF's recommendations is arriving. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, isn't impressed by the idea of bringing infrastructure spending forwards. Spend the existing money more wisely instead, he argues: When the IMF says that planned fiscal tightening will be a drag on growth, the discretionary measures amount to only \u00a310 billion, which is pretty small. It would make more sense to argue to maintain the overall level of public spending, whilst shifting a greater proportion towards infrastructure, where the fiscal multipliers are stronger. In other words spend the existing money better, rather than spend even more. The language in the report issued by the International Monetary Fund is milder then the rhetoric of last month, when Olivier Blanchard said the UK was \"playing with fire\" by not implementing more growth measures. But that doesn't mean it's not concerned. Indeed, the IMF says it's now taking a tougher line with the UK: Time to recap the key points from the IMF's report into the UK. \u2022 The International Monetary Fund has called for the UK government to bring in new growth measures to support the economy and ease the pace of its austerity programme. Speaking in London David Lipton, first deputy managing director of the Fund, said the UK economy remained weak, and could suffer permanent damage without additional help. George Osborne should bring forward intrastructure projects where possible to offset the \u00a310bn of cuts hitting the economy this year, he told reporters in London. This would mean the government changing the pace of its fiscal plan, with Lipton arguing that the UK's fiscal adjustment should take place in \"a more backloaded fashion\". Without adjusting its plans, he said, Britain risked higher unemployment and lower growth in the medium term. Our view is there is no silver bullet. We are not suggesting that this adjustment in the path of fiscal consolidation would be enough to restore the economy to full utilisation. But we do think it could play a useful and a helpful role for the economy, for workers, and for companies. The key quotes from Lipton are here. \u2022 Lipton said the IMF was encouraged by recent economic data from the UK. However, it remaind concerned that \"persistent low growth\" will damage medium-term growth forecasts. And he didn't shy away from pushing the UK government to do more. On infrastructure spending in particular, he said: ...the government should be more supportive than it has been or it plans to be. \u2022 Lipton was speaking after the IMF published its latest annual review of the UK economy. Following a two-week assessment, they also recommended that the UK should speed up the sale of its stakes in RBS and Lloyds. Full report here. \u2022 Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, urged Osborne to take the IMF's advice. He claimed Lipton's comments showed that the government had not done enough to support jobs and growth: Behind the diplomatic language this is the call for action on jobs and growth that the IMF has been threatening to deliver for many months and a stark warning of the consequences if the Chancellor refuses to listen. More from Balls here. The IMF is also clear that its recommendations do not amount to a complete new fiscal plan for Britain. Watching the IMF's press conference again, the key section comes when David Lipton fleshes out the Fund's recommendation for increased spending on infrastructure. Q: Are you saying that the UK government should slow its planned pace of fiscal consolidation this year in order to support growth? Lipton: Yeah, what we're saying is that... within the framework of its medium-term objectives, that it would be in our view useful for the economy for some... infrastructure investment and other measures to be brought towards the present to reduce the drag that is presently intended under the present framework in this year and in the coming years. In essence this would be to allow the adjustment to take place in a more backloaded fashion and provide more support for the economy at the front end of the period. Lipton was then asked whether the government should look to offset the full \u00a310bn of drag from the fiscal consolidation this year., and replies: We see room to offset the drag from the planned discretionary measures.... I want to be clear, we are recommending a range of other policies beside fiscal policies that would also be supportive of the economy. Our view is there is no silver bullet. We are not suggesting that this adjustment in the path of fiscal consolidation would be enough to restore the economy to full utilisation. But we do think it could play a useful and a helpful role for the economy, for workers, and for companies. Now, to determine exactly how much is feasable one has to look through the infrastructure roster and see what can be advanced. Our view is that what can be advanced, should be advanced. You can watch a recording of the press conference here. The above quotes are from 14 minutes in. Back at the Treasury, David Lipton is explaining to journalists why the government should bring forward more infrastructure spending to help the economy. Faisal Islam of Channel 4 News tweets the highlights: Ed Balls MP, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, says that \"behind the diplomatic language\" the IMF is urging the government to adjust its plans. Here's his full statement: Behind the diplomatic language this is the call for action on jobs and growth that the IMF has been threatening to deliver for many months and a stark warning of the consequences if the Chancellor refuses to listen. The IMF is clear that we are a long way from the strong and sustained recovery we need and backs the warnings we have made for three years that the Government\u2019s plans are a drag on growth and risk doing long-term damage. They say, as we have, that you need to strike a balance between the pace of fiscal consolidation and support for growth and jobs. And it is clear that the Government has not got that balance right. That is why the IMF is calling for urgent action to kick-start the economy, including bringing forward long-term infrastructure investment. With the IMF warning that the recovery is far from secure and the risks are to the downside, a sensible Chancellor would listen to the IMF\u2019s advice and take action. Only a reckless Chancellor would try to plough on regardless. George Osborne has gained a reputation for always putting politics before economics. This is his chance to redress the balance and do the right thing for Britain. Our economics editor Larry Elliott was at the press conference, and confirms that while the initial IMF verdict may have appeared to have pulled its punches, that was not the message coming out from Lipton: Larry tell me that the Fund's verdict is: The UK economy is very weak and it has serious problems. The IMF may have couched its report in more diplomatic and palatable language but the definite message is that they want to see more action. There's another briefing at the Treasury now, and Larry will be giving his full analysis later. Curious press conference, that. David Lipton was rather more critical of the govenment's plans than in the IMF's official statement. That statement's now online here: The press conference is over. Reaction and analysis to follow. Lipton explains that the IMF's proposals are still 'fiscally neutral' over the long term. But the fund is effectively suggesting that some of the government's fiscal adjustment should be pushed backwards. And Lipton also warned that the UK could suffer higher unemployment and lose economic capacity permanently if ignores the advice. Q: Would Britain be in a better place if the government had prioritised infrastructure spending earlier? Yes, Lipton replies. If there had been greater focus several years ago then it would be easier to get projects under way now. But that's with the benefit of hindsight, he adds.... Another question on whether the IMF has changed its mind on Britain. Lipton replies that the Fund is encouraged by recent data, but still believes the government should do more to stimulate growth: The economic data shows an uptick... we acknowledge that and welcome that but it's modest so far... The output gap remains substantial and likely to remain so for some time, so we continue to see areas for further action. The IMF is pretty clear that the spending cuts being implemented tthus year will hurt growth -- thus its call for extra growth measures. Here's the key section from the report: But planned fiscal tightening will be a drag on growth. Discretionary measures for this fiscal year amount to \u00a310bn. These will pose headwinds to growth, as expected, coming on top of domestic deleveraging and a weak external outlook, notably at a time when resources in the economy are underutilized. Q: Has the IMF toned down its criticism of the UK, having been so critical of Osborne earlier in the year? Lipton replies that there are areas where Britain must do more to address demand and supply constraints. In particular, infrastructure spending. Lipton explains: On a range of areas, the government should be more supportive than it has been or it plans to be.... and this effort should start now... \"There's no single silver bullet\" to improve the UK economy, Lipton says. But bringing forward capital spending (as explained at 12.11pm) would be good for businesses, and good for consumers, he suggests. At the press conference, David Lipton is saying Britain needs a multi-pronged approach to the crisis. The government should do more to stimulate growth, and the Bank of England should keep interest rates low until the economy is strong. You should be able to watch the press conference on the BBC's website, or on Reuters here. Here's some rapid analysis from my colleague Heather Stewart: Even before the IMF's team touched down in London, Treasury officials had promised to put up a staunch defence of their tax-and-spending policies. George Osborne will regard it as a triumph that his officials succeeded in persuading the IMF a) to concede that there are signs of life in the UK economy; and b) to leave out any specific call for a change of heart on fiscal policy. But the mood music is still grim: the IMF stresses the \"tepid\" nature of the recovery, and warns that growth is likely to remain weak for a prolonged period, as the banking sector repairs itself and the eurozone downturn rolls on. Against that backdrop, it says, the Treasury faces a \"dilemma\", between fixing the deficit, and underpinning growth. And reading between the lines, the IMF is fairly clear about which prong of the dilemma it would seize: it warns of the \"permanent\" damage that could be done to the economy by a long period of economic weakness. The IMF press conference in underway in London, with David Lipton outlining the situation in the UK. He gave a sobering assessment of the UK economy, saying the recovery is slow, and explaining how a new burst of capital spending could secure the recovery. The key message form Lipton, really, is that Britain faces an unpleasant dilemma:further fiscal consolidation will weaken the UK output, and risk permanent damage to the economy. However, relaxing the pace of fiscal consolidation will see debts accumulate further. Thus, he suggests, Osborne's best plan is to pursue measures that address \"supply-side constraints\" and also provide near-term support for the economy. Particularly, he adds, when Britain's borrowing costs are so low and peopel are out of work: In the current context in which labor is underutilized and funding costs are cheap, the net returns from such measures are likely to be particularly favorable. As expected, the IMF also urges the government to get Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds back fully into the private sector as soon as possible. While not directly criticising Osborne's fiscal programme, the IMF calls for several \"growth-enhancing initiatives\" to offset the drag from consolidation and bolster the recovery. It also warns that the chancellor's new Help To Buy scheme could backfire. Here's the iMF's growth recommentations: \u2022 Bringing forward planned capital investment where possible, which would help catalyze private investment and spur much-needed growth. Alongside this, well- designed public guarantees could be used to facilitate private investment. \u2022 Further modifying the composition of consolidation to boost growth. This could include growth-friendly measures, such as reducing marginal effective corporate tax rates to bring investment forward, and introducing tax allowances for raising equity. To offset the budgetary impact of these measures over the medium term, the government could undertake a reform of property taxes and consider broadening the VAT base. \u2022 The 2013 Budget announced a new scheme, Help To Buy, aimed at boosting activity in the housing market. This measure may temporarily help boost confidence in the housing market, but there is a risk that, in the absence of an adequate supply response, the result would ultimately be mostly house price increases that would work against the aim of boosting access to housing. To mitigate this risk and engineer a supply response, the government should consider fiscal disincentives for holding land without development. Despite those recent signs of recovery, the IMF warns that Britain faces the prospect of a prolonged period of weak growth, with risks to the downside. The eurozone crisis is a key threat, it added: Here's the key section: The key risk is that persistent slow growth could permanently damage medium-term growth prospects\u2014this could arise if private sector deleveraging is larger than expected, credit conditions fail to improve, external demand does not pick up, and the drag from fiscal consolidation is greater than anticipated. In addition, despite recent market calm, growth in the euro area is likely to be weak, and the re-emergence of market tensions cannot be ruled out, with the potential for continued spillovers to the UK from depressed exports, higher bank losses and funding costs. The report is out! And the International Monetary Fund has warned that the UK faces a slow recovery. It urges the government should implement new growth measures to stimulate the economy. But it has not directly call on George Osborne to delay his spending cuts, saying there are \"nascent signs of momentum\u201d. There's no explicit call to slow the pace of fiscal consolidation, but the IMF remains concerned about the economic situation. In its official statement following the two-week visit to London, the IMF said there are encouraging economic signs, but warns: The UK is, however, still a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery. Notwithstanding the recent uptick in activity, per capita income remains 6 percent below its pre-crisis peak, making this the weakest recovery in recent history. Of particular concern is that capital investment (as a share of GDP) is at a postwar low, and that youth unemployment is high. More to follow! Just under 10 minutes to go until the IMF's conclusions are announced. It'll be followed by a press conference with David Lipton, first deputy managing director of the IMF, and Krishna Srinivasan, IMF assistant director and UK mission chief. And lots of reaction from Westminster and the City... Speaking of tax, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has said he raised the issue with Google's chief executive on Monday. My colleage Andrew Sparrow has the details in his Politics Live blog. Back to Brussels, and David Cameron banged the drum against tax avoidance as he arrived for today's European Council meeting. The PM told reporters that international collaberation was a key part of ensuring that companies were paying appropriate amounts of tax. Reuters has the quotes: I believe in low taxes for businesses because we have got to encourage investment, we have got to encourage jobs.\" \"We have got to make sure as we set those tax rates that companies pay taxes and that means international collaboration, the sharing of tax information.\" \"I am making that the headline of my G8 summit in a month's time and it is important that we make sure that (in) the European Union as well, that we act together to make sure we do everything on this agenda. It is good for our own countries, it is also good for the developing world as well. Under an hour to go until the IMF releases its statement on the UK economy. In the meantime, the Labour Party has cited today's public borrowing figures (Britain borrowed \u00a38bn in April) as proof that George Osborne should change course. Here's the statement from Chris Leslie MP, Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury: The Government\u2019s failing economic policies continue to be self-defeating. A flatlining economy and high unemployment means lower tax revenues and more benefits spending, which is why deficit reduction has stalled. Underlying borrowing was \u00a31.3 billion higher last month compared to a year ago and the Government is now set to borrow \u00a3245 billion more than planned. This is not more borrowing to invest in creating jobs for the future, but simply to pay for the costs of this government\u2019s economic failure. After three years of failure the Chancellor must realise that we need strong and sustained growth to get the deficit down. Alongside sensible spending cuts and tax rises we need a jobs and growth plan, including building thousands of affordable homes and a compulsory jobs guarantee for the long term unemployed. But will the IMF agree? Not long until we find out.... Corporate tax avoidance is of the major issues under discussion at today's European Council meeting. The Irish government has insisted today that the problem can only be solved through global co-operation, which sounds like another attempt to rebut criticism of its own low corporation tax rate, Reuters has the story: The international community needs to work together to stop large multinationals aggressively playing one country's tax code off against another, Ireland's Minister for Enterprise said on Wednesday. \"They play the tax codes one against the other, that is tax planning and I think we do need international cooperation through the OECD to deal with the aggressive nature of that,\" Richard Bruton told national broadcaster RTE. Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, may expand on this point when he briefs the media in around 40 minutes time. Over in Brussels, European leaders are arriving for today's European Council meeting. There's a live feed here. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, agrees that it's \"too premature\" to call the UK as out of the woods, following that drop in retail sales. Households are struggling with price rises outstripping earnings growth and government benefit cuts. The pound has dropped over half a cent to below $1.51 as traders digest the news that UK retail sales were so weak in April. Economists are concerned too. Here's Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Even allowing for the negative impact of ongoing cold weather and the fact that Easter occurred in March this year, April\u2019s marked drop in retail sales provides a reminder that the economy is not yet out of the woods and still has a challenging job to develop sustained, clear growth. It's certainly hard to believe a 4.1% drop in food sales can be blamed on Easter and the weather: Britain borrowed \u00a38bn to balance its books in April, a record for the month. However, strip out the effect of the 2008 bank bailouts, and the monthly deficit came in at \u00a36.3bn - below forecasts. So better news than the disappointing retail sales: UK retail sales took an unexpected, and nasty, tumble in April, new data just showed. Retail sales fell by 1.4% in April (stripping out fuel costs), their biggest fall in a year, suggesting that the economy may not be recovering as briskly as hoped. Food sales were down by 4.1%. The Office for National Statistics blamed the bad weather in April -- apparently sales of barbecue food and garden furniture were particularly weak. The Bank of England minutes are online here: Here's the section on the MPC's assessment of the economy: News on the month had on balance been favourable and it was likely that the level of output at the end of Q2 would be 0.7% higher than the Committee had expected three months ago. By and large, asset prices had continued to rise, but the outlook for the global economy remained subdued, and the risk of a more severe crisis in the euro area remained a major potential impediment to the domestic recovery. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee remained divided 6-3 on whether to expand its quantitative easing programme, minutes of its last meeting show. Governor Mervyn King, Paul Fisher and David Miles all pushed for another \u00a325bn of QE, but were outvoted again. And setting the scene for the IMF press conference at noon, the MPC said it was more upbeat about the UK economy....but still concerned about the eurozone. More to follow. Treasury insiders are prepared for IMF criticism, despite recent upbeat economic data, according to Claire Jones and Chris Giles in the Financial Times. They point to Tuesday's fall in inflation, for the first time since last September: The timing is ideal for a chancellor at loggerheads with fund economists. But officials do not think the better economic data will be enough to silence IMF calls for the UK to reduce the pace of deficit reduction. And like Nick Watt this morning (see 8.09am), the FT also reckons the chancellor will not bow to any criticism. Is the worst over for George Osborne, asks Gaby Hinsliff this morning. As she points out, the chancellor has looked quite upbeat recently \"for a man undergoing the economic equivalent of having the Ofsted inspectors in\" (great phrase): The buzz in Whitehall is that today's crucial IMF assessment of the economy, compiled by a team that has spent weeks embedded in the Treasury, won't be without criticism but will be less devastating than initially feared. After several false alarms, the Treasury finally thinks it spies light at the end of a very dark tunnel. There are reasons for optimism, now that the UK economy has returned to growth. Britain's dominant service sector just posted its best month since the Olympics, for example, and the stock market rally (the FTSE 100 hit a new 12-year high last night) means a section of the population are feeling wealthier. It may be the wrong sort of recovery -- based on asset bubbles rather than a resurgence of British industry. But as Gaby explains, there are major political implications: And after five miserable years, better-off swing voters may well be tempted to treat even fake prosperity much as Britons traditionally do the first sniff of sunshine, by getting out there and frying while it lasts. They're going to take some convincing that it's a bad thing for their pension funds to be growing again in a bullish stock market, or for their houses to be worth stupid amounts \u2013 even if they are worried about their own children being forced off the property ladder. The challenge for Labour, then, may soon be persuading voters to look this dubious economic gift horse in the mouth. Here's the full piece: George Osborne may not be dead in the water after all. What will Labour do then? Someone stands to lose face today when the International Monetary Fund passes judgment on the UK, says our economics editor Larry Elliott. But will it be George Osborne, or the IMF's chief economist Olivier Blanchard? It was Blanchard who last month famously criticised the chancellor's March budget for not containing more growth-friendly measures. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, also went public with her worries over the UK. Larry writes: George Osborne was furious when IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard dropped his anti-austerity bombshell during its spring meeting in Washington. The Treasury has been doing its utmost to get the IMF mission to change its view during talks over the past fortnight. But Larry also flags up that Robert Reich, former labour secretary under Bill Clinton, revealed yesterday that US policymakers use Britain as an example of the dangers of austerity.... David Lipton, first deputy managing director of the IMF, and Krishna Srinivasan, IMF assistant director and UK mission chief, will hold a press conference at noon in the Treasury, in London. Their report, officially called the Conclusion of IMF Article IV Mission to the United Kingdom, will also be released at 12.00pm. There's also a torrent of UK economic data this morning, including the details of the Bank of England's last monetary policy meeting. And in Europe, leaders will be meeting for a European Council meeting where growth and tax avoidance will be discussed. \u2022 Bank of England minutes: 9.30am BST \u2022 UK public finances and retail sales: 9.30am BST \u2022 CBI industrial trends: 11am BST \u2022 European Council meeting; afternoon \u2022 Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, testifying at the Senate: 3pm BST The IMF may also push the UK government to speed up the sale of its stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. There were reports last night that today's report will recommend that disposing of the \u00a365bn stakes in the two bailed-out banks is made a priority. Speculation has been building for weeks that George Osborne could start the selloff process soon, although the chancellor has not yet laid out a timescale. At present, though, RBS's share price is below the price at which the taxpayer bought its stake. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: Hopes of a sell-off of the 39% stake in Lloyds and 81% stake in RBS have risen in recent days as their share prices have climbed. On Tuesday shares in Lloyds closed just above 61p, the level which the Treasury has signalled it now regards as break-even for the taxpayer, while RBS was at 342p, still below any break-even targets set by the government. Good morning. The British government and the International Monetary Fund could go toe-to-toe today, when the IMF publishes its annual healthcheck of the UK economy. After two weeks trawling through the nation's accounts and interviewing top officials, the IMF will release its conclusions at noon, followed by a press conference in London. The IMF had been expected to call for George Osborne to make fresh moves to stimulate the economy, and slow the pace of his fiscal cuts package. Just a month ago, its top economist warned that the UK government was \"playing with fire\" by not doing more to boost the weak economy. But recent data \u2013 including the news that Britain's economy has started growing again \u2013 may have changed the IMF's mind. Or could at least mean its criticism is watered down. David Cameron's government has already nailed its fiscal colours to the mast, declaring that it remains confident in its plans. Nicholas Watt, our chief political correspondent, writes this morning: Downing Street said on Tuesday that it would not anticipate what the IMF will say when it publishes its annual healthcheck of the British economy under its article IV programme. But the prime minister's spokesman added: \"The government believes it has the right economic approach.\" Downing Street said that the latest GDP figures showed that the British economy is growing and jobs are being created. \"Our view is the economy is healing and we are on the right road but we have to stick to it,\" Cameron's spokesman said. Nick's full story is here: Government will 'stick to its plans' when IMF delivers verdict on economy. I'll be tracking the story through the day, along with other key events in the UK economy and beyond.",

The results from the ballot, which also asks workers their opinion on pay and conditions and whether they would support a boycott of competitors' mail, are due on 19 June. A yes vote could lead to the biggest disruption to the post service since industrial action six years ago as half of all letters in the daily postbag would not be delivered. Royal Mail said it was \"disappointed\" that the union was going ahead with the ballot. \"We are committed to seeking an agreement with the CWU on the way forward in Royal Mail that equips the business for the future and is fair to our employees,\" a spokesman said. He warned employees that a boycotting delivery of rival firms' mail would \"adversely impact the business, our reputation and that of our employees\". The vote comes just a day after Royal Mail boss Moya Greene pleaded with the CWU to stop the campaign against a selloff and \"continue to drive our business forward as we seek to realise our collective objectives\". The CWU has repeatedly vowed to fight the sale, which it says will lead to a \"worse deal for customers, staff and thousands of small businesses dependent on the Royal Mail\". Greene said privatisation was the only way the 497-year-old postal service could survive. The business minister, Michael Fallon, who is in charge of the privatisation, said the government is \"committed\" to the sale, which could see the Royal Mail fall into foreign hands.

It is this short-term margin fall that leads us to cut our price target, despite the earnings upgrade. The quarterly production report should provide a cost and operational update, particularly on the Esperanza throughput fix and Antucoya project. But Kazakhmys led the mid-cap fallers, down 22p at 343.3p after UBS cut from buy to neutral and reduced its price target from 465p to 385p. The bank said that the proposed acquisition of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, up 0.1p at 266.2p, by its founder oligarchs - which involves using the Kazakh government's stake in Kazakhmys - could cause uncertainty for the miner: With current ENRC shareholders likely to be event-driven, there is the potential these holders will not be long term holders in Kazakhmys, raising the risk of some flowback. Banks were boosted by the latest updates on their capital positions, with Lloyds Banking Group up 1.43p at 62.96p and Royal Bank of Scotland 7.4p better at 349.6p. But Morrisons fell 6.7p to 282.6p after UBS confirmed it had placed around 100m shares - or 4.4% - at 280p on behalf of an institutional seller, suggested by traders as perhaps being Walter Scott &amp; Partners. Arm dipped 15p to \u00a310.50 as analysts issued cautious notes about the outlook following the chipmaker's investor day on Tuesday. Testing equipment group Intertek fell 39p to \u00a332.35 as its shares went ex-dividend. Building materials group Wolseley lost 52p to \u00a334.31 as Morgan Stanley issued an underweight recommendation. The bank said: Despite support from strong momentum, we view the shares as more than fully valued. Wolseley is experiencing a slowdown in the markets outside the US, while consensus expectations on the potential for further margin improvement appear excessive.",

These losses will then hit the public finances.",

The huge rise in profits will cause further outrage among fuel poverty campaigners and householders struggling to pay their bills. It will also heap more pressure on both the government and Ofgem, who have been accused of standing by as the big six suppliers profit at their customers' expense. SSE tried to deflect criticism of its profits, taking out full-page advertisements in newspapers ahead of the results. \"That profit is paying taxes, improving services, investing in the future and creating jobs \u2013 all here in the UK,\" it said. But Ann Robinson at uSwitch.com said: \"These profits will be seen as a smoking gun, making it difficult for any supplier to justify last winter's price hikes and the pressure they have placed on consumers. People have been going cold for fear of the cost of turning their heating on \u2013 in these circumstances a price cut or a price freeze is the only suitable peace offering and would go some way to helping and reassuring consumers.\" Last October SSE, which supplies 9.6m households with gas and electricity, raised domestic energy prices by 9% to coincide with the start of the coldest and longest winter of recent years. The company said on Wednesday that average household gas consumption in the UK rose by 21% last year, while electricity consumption was 5% higher. The retail business helped drive adjusted profits before tax for the group \u2013 which includes SSE's networks and wholesale units \u2013 up 5.6% to \u00a31.4bn. The company did, however, write down the value of certain investments by almost \u00a3400m and was hit with charges related to claims from outages in prior years, while movements in derivative contracts dented profits by around \u00a3200m. That left total profits before tax at \u00a3601m for the year. SSE upped its full-year dividend by 5.1% to 84.2p. It added that it will maintain annual dividend increases above inflation \u2013 as measured by the retail prices index \u2013 this year and beyond. Data out on Tuesday showed annual RPI fell from 3.3% to 2.9% last month. SSE was hit by a mis-selling scandal that saw it fined a record \u00a310.5m in April. The SSE chairman, Lord Smith of Kelvin, said on Wednesday: \"Like everyone else associated with SSE I have no hesitation in apologising unequivocally for the breaches that occurred; but while the breaches were clearly wrong, the response has been absolutely right.\" He said the company had reformed its retail operations since 2011 and introduced a sales guarantee to reimburse any losses experienced by customers joining the company. The company confirmed that chief executive Ian Marchant would step down at the end of next month, after a decade at the helm of the company. He will be replaced by his deputy, Alistair Phillips-Davies. \u2022 You can compare and switch energy tariffs with the Guardian's Money Deals service",

      "bodyText": "Retail sales slumped in April after shoppers balked at rising prices and were reluctant to venture out to the high street in one of the coldest springs on record. The Office for National Statistics said retailers reported a 1.3% decline in the amount of goods sold, with food shops the worst affected. Sales of food plunged 4.1% on the month, the weakest showing in almost two years. Shops also suffered a 0.2% contraction in the amount of money spent on the same month a year ago, which was the biggest year-on-year fall in retail spending since the turn of the century. The cold weather was the biggest factor as the sale of barbecue food, garden furniture and summer dresses was put on hold. April was also a terrible month for garden centres following the big chill that effectively delayed spring by a month. Several major stores have announced a significant bounce back in May, with garden centre sales reportedly up 70% in the first three months of the year, but the overall contraction, and especially the deterrent of rising food inflation, will concern the Treasury. Ministers are hopeful of a bounce back in consumer confidence during 2013 to increase high-street sales and boost economic growth. The ONS said consumer prices data showed that food prices had steadily been increasing and that a wide variety of food types contributed to the rise, including staple goods. \"This rise in prices will have squeezed consumers' disposable income, possibly resulting in them buying less or substituting cheaper goods for their normal purchases,\" it said. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the weather-related drop in sales was a reminder that the economy remains in a fragile state. \"It is likely that spending will revive again in coming months, helping keep the country out of another downturn, though recovery will be only gradual as incomes continue to be squeezed,\" he said. He pointed out that the underlying picture was more likely one of modest growth of sales following a 0.7% rise in the latest three months sales on the previous three-month period, which was the strongest rate of increase since last September. \"Households' views on their finances are the brightest for three years, according to Markit's household finance index for May. Being busier at work, rising house prices, news of the country having avoided another recession and buoyant equity markets have all helped generate more of a 'feel-good factor'.\"",

According to the Vienna university study, more than half (52%) of social entrepreneurs' budget comes from private funding, one-third comes from their own earnings, while roughly 10% come from federal sources.</p> <p>Specific social venture funds do not yet exist in Austria. The financial sector, as well as the social entrepreneurs themselves, still need to capture the opportunities of social financing. One pioneer is <a href=\"http://www.erstestiftung.org/factory/good-bee/\" title=\"\">Good.Bee</a>, which is providing financing for social enterprises and works in the field of micro-finance in central and eastern Europe. Crowd-funding is also a source for funding: online platforms such as <a href=\"http://www.respekt.net/\" title=\"\">respekt.net</a> help to connect promising projects with investors.</p> <h2><strong>Countering the brain-drain</strong></h2> <p>The social entrepreneurs in Austria tackle a wide range of different issues. In the field of regional development, Ashoka fellow <a href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/fellow/martin-hollinetz\" title=\"\">Martin Hollinetz</a> founded <a href=\"http://www.otelo.or.at/\" title=\"\">Otelo</a>, which counters the brain drain in rural areas by establishing regional innovation centres, giving people the necessary infrastructure to be innovative and creative and the possibility to start their own enterprises.</p> <p>Inclusion of marginalised groups in mainstream society is a major focus of Austrian social entrepreneurs \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.careermoves.at/\" title=\"\">Career Moves</a>, for instance, connects people with disabilities with potential employers. Gregor Demblin, the founder, sees huge potential in people with disabilities, as they can be top performers, whose potential is not used due to societal prejudice. <a href=\"http://www.ngoexit.org/\" title=\"\">Exit</a>, an NGO, helps victims of human trafficking by giving not only legal and psychological advice but also by helping these victims to set up a new life in Austria, and not fall back into prostitution, where they ended up after coming to Austria.</p> <h2><strong>A new career path</strong></h2> <p>Many young people in Austria do not yet realise that there is a new career path that combines entrepreneurial spirit with solving major social challenges. But several social entrepreneurship support-organisations such as The HUB Vienna, awards such as The Social Impact Award or training programmes like <a href=\"http://pioneersofchange.at/\" title=\"\">Pioneers of Change</a> in Vienna especially attract young social entrepreneurs.</p> <p>These young aspiring talents have a very unique and fresh approach to deal with a multitude of social problems: <a href=\"http://www.whatchado.net/\" title=\"\">whatchado</a> is helping young people to find out what career paths exist and how to get there. They interview people of different backgrounds and sectors and feature them in short films to explain how they became what they are today. <a href=\"http://www.dachgold.at/\" title=\"\">Dachgold</a> is convincing companies to use solar energy to cover their energy needs, because they use most of their energy during the day (unlike many private households). Since solar energy storage is very inefficient, using the energy right away during the day is a very sustainable solution.</p> <p>It is not just a lack of knowledge and access which inhibit young social entrepreneurs from starting their own initiative \u2013 they are often just afraid to take the risks of founding their own projects. Ashoka fellow <a href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/fellow/johannes-lindner\" title=\"\">Johannes Lindner</a> responded to this by starting <a href=\"http://www.eesi-impulszentrum.at/\" title=\"\">Entrepreneurship Education</a> in many Austrian schools and helps students become more entrepreneurial, self-dependent and lose the fear of taking initiative. Johannes's business plan competitions encourage young people to combine their entrepreneurial thinking with self-driven action. Each year, <a href=\"http://austria.ashoka.org/node/1712/\" title=\"\">2,500 students participate in these competitions, and two-thirds of the projects</a> are actually implemented. In Austrian secondary schools, 20,000 students benefit weekly from the teaching and learning content developed by him.</p> <p>Social entrepreneurship in Austria is still too young for us to grasp its scale and impact. Nevertheless, this movement has a lot of potential to bring about social change. One of the main challenges is the lack of support infrastructure outside the urban,densely populated areas. Focus should also be given to initiatives that encourage youth to become more involved and engaged in solving social problems. Competitions for young social entrepreneurs such as the <a href=\"http://socialimpactaward.net/\" title=\"\">Social Impact Award</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.joinourcore.com/\" title=\"\">Join our Core</a> competition clearly show that there is lot of potential among Austrian youth.</p> <p>Young people no longer want to adapt to often rigid and uninspired structures in established organisations and companies. Instead, they would prefer to set up their own enterprises where they can live their values, be creative and shape the impact they want to have on society. Without doubt, Austrians will have to take more risks to solve social problems. As Melinda Gates, wife of Bill, the Microsoft billionaire, says \"We believe in taking risks, because that's how you move things along.\"</p> <p><em>Michael Hagelmuller is a mobiliser for </em><a href=\"http://www.joinourcore.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Join Our Core Ashoka Austria</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content was brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

In the field of regional development, Ashoka fellow Martin Hollinetz founded Otelo, which counters the brain drain in rural areas by establishing regional innovation centres, giving people the necessary infrastructure to be innovative and creative and the possibility to start their own enterprises. Inclusion of marginalised groups in mainstream society is a major focus of Austrian social entrepreneurs \u2013 Career Moves, for instance, connects people with disabilities with potential employers. Gregor Demblin, the founder, sees huge potential in people with disabilities, as they can be top performers, whose potential is not used due to societal prejudice. Exit, an NGO, helps victims of human trafficking by giving not only legal and psychological advice but also by helping these victims to set up a new life in Austria, and not fall back into prostitution, where they ended up after coming to Austria. A new career path Many young people in Austria do not yet realise that there is a new career path that combines entrepreneurial spirit with solving major social challenges. But several social entrepreneurship support-organisations such as The HUB Vienna, awards such as The Social Impact Award or training programmes like Pioneers of Change in Vienna especially attract young social entrepreneurs. These young aspiring talents have a very unique and fresh approach to deal with a multitude of social problems: whatchado is helping young people to find out what career paths exist and how to get there. They interview people of different backgrounds and sectors and feature them in short films to explain how they became what they are today. Dachgold is convincing companies to use solar energy to cover their energy needs, because they use most of their energy during the day (unlike many private households). Since solar energy storage is very inefficient, using the energy right away during the day is a very sustainable solution. It is not just a lack of knowledge and access which inhibit young social entrepreneurs from starting their own initiative \u2013 they are often just afraid to take the risks of founding their own projects. Ashoka fellow Johannes Lindner responded to this by starting Entrepreneurship Education in many Austrian schools and helps students become more entrepreneurial, self-dependent and lose the fear of taking initiative. Johannes's business plan competitions encourage young people to combine their entrepreneurial thinking with self-driven action. Each year, 2,500 students participate in these competitions, and two-thirds of the projects are actually implemented. In Austrian secondary schools, 20,000 students benefit weekly from the teaching and learning content developed by him. Social entrepreneurship in Austria is still too young for us to grasp its scale and impact. Nevertheless, this movement has a lot of potential to bring about social change. One of the main challenges is the lack of support infrastructure outside the urban,densely populated areas. Focus should also be given to initiatives that encourage youth to become more involved and engaged in solving social problems. Competitions for young social entrepreneurs such as the Social Impact Award or the Join our Core competition clearly show that there is lot of potential among Austrian youth. Young people no longer want to adapt to often rigid and uninspired structures in established organisations and companies. Instead, they would prefer to set up their own enterprises where they can live their values, be creative and shape the impact they want to have on society. Without doubt, Austrians will have to take more risks to solve social problems.
