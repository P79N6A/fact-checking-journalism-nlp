    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "JPMorgan Chase is to raise its guaranteed minimum wage for employees by a fifth, placing its baseline pay in line with the national \u201cFight for $15\u201d movement. \u201cA pay increase is the right thing to do,\u201d the chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, wrote in an opinion piece published in the New York Times. \u201cWages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long. Many employees who will receive this increase work as bank tellers and customer service representatives. Above all it enables more people to begin to share in the rewards of economic growth.\u201d Under the new guidelines, the bank will raise pay for 18,000 employees to between $12 and $16.50 an hour for full-time, part-time and new employees, depending on location and division. The bank\u2019s current minimum wage is $10.15 an hour (plus benefits), about $3 above the current national minimum. JPMorgan is the first of the major US banks to take action in the minimum wage debate, having allowed smaller institutions such as Amalgamated Bank to take the lead. But the latest move will be contrasted against Dimon\u2019s own pay package. Dimon\u2019s total pay for 2015 rose to $27m from $20m last year. In January, JPMorgan increased Dimon\u2019s pay by more than a third, subject to various performance tests over three years before he is paid out in full. His base salary remains at $1.5m, but he receives a cash bonus of $5m, down from $7.4m last year. The remaining $20.5m comes in the form of performance share units (PSUs). Dimon\u2019s package nonetheless reflects the banking industry\u2019s changing sentiments over executive pay. Last year JPMorgan shareholders voted against existing executive pay policies, forcing the bank to reform the ties between pay and performance. Dimon came under criticism for a $7.4m cash bonus that institutional shareholder groups ISS and Glass Lewis described as lacking \u201ca compelling rationale\u201d. Dimon, one of Wall Street\u2019s longest-serving executives, saw his pay award peak at $30m in 2007. During the financial crisis the following year, his remuneration package dropped to a salary of $1m and no incentives. However, in recent years executive pay has risen again to near pre-recession levels even as bank profits have remained constricted by low interest rates and problematic global economic conditions. Pay for big bank chief executives jumped nearly 7.6% in 2015, 10 times faster than a year earlier, according to analysis by the compensation company Equilar and the Financial Times. The pay packages for chief executives at the top six US banks rose by an average of 10%, or almost twice the rate of their European rivals. In 2015, the chiefs of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were paid an average of $20.7m including salaries, bonuses and pension contributions. Of those, Jamie Dimon was the highest-paid executive with a pay package of $27.6m. That contrasts with a 2014 government study that found of about 1.7 million people working in retail banking in the US, almost one-third \u2013 more than 500,000 people \u2013 are in jobs with median hourly wages below $15.",

    "webTitle": "Marco Gobbetti: the man tasked with putting Burberry back in fashion", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marco Gobbetti is the quiet man behind C\u00e9line, the minimalist luxury brand that brought normcore to the catwalk. Now, after his appointment as chief executive of Burberry, the British fashion company is in the unusual position of having two bosses. Following pressure from shareholders, Christopher Bailey is moving to one side as the company seeks to turn around its flagging performance with additional retail and operational expertise. Britain\u2019s biggest luxury label has run into problems. When Bailey took over as chief executive in 2013, while retaining his role as chief creative officer, the brand was motoring, driven by seemingly insatiable demand for anything with Burberry\u2019s trademark beige check from Chinese shoppers. But an economic slowdown and a crackdown on conspicuous consumption, together with limits on travel to the shopping mecca of Hong Kong following pro-democracy demonstrations, have harmed trade. Its shares have fallen from 1,908p to 1,203p. The focus has shifted to cost cutting, streamlining the business and pulling in more shoppers to existing stores. Shareholders had been worried that Bailey lacked the right skills for these tasks. Gobbetti is a management expert with a long pedigree in managing luxury businesses. He has had stints at C\u00e9line, Moschino and Givenchy, and was signed up with \u00a34m in shares as a golden handshake. He is relatively low profile, but C\u00e9line is a commercial success story, having enjoyed double-digit sales growth and strong profits at a time when its peers have been struggling. The French label is highly regarded, so much so that fashion editors wear it. It\u2019s a favourite label on the front row and a hot ticket at Paris fashion week, partly thanks to the company\u2019s British designer Phoebe Philo, who has created a signature style that is minimal, chic and reassuringly expensive. Gobbetti, working with Philo since her appointment as creative director in 2008, was the silent partner in the success of the brand, allowing Philo to concentrate on designing, while he worked on the business strategy that emphasised the discreet and rarified image of C\u00e9line. Bailey has described the new set up \u2013 he has been given the title of president \u2013 as \u201ca partnership built on respect and working collaboratively together\u201d. He may have been attracted to Gobbetti\u2019s apparent knack for working alongside creative types. Gobbetti partnered Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy before joining up successfully with Philo. Bailey and Gobbetti will earn the same base salary of \u00a31.1m, although Gobbetti will receive an annual cash allowance of \u00a380,000 to cover his travel, car and clothing, compared with Bailey\u2019s \u00a3464,000 a year in benefits. The incoming chief executive could receive nearly \u00a37m in the year ahead if he hits targets for his annual bonus, worth double his salary, and a long-term share bonus of 3.25 times his salary. Bailey may relish the creative freedom that Gobbetti allowed at the C\u00e9line head office, which he created in a Parisian neoclassical mansion known as the H\u00f4tel Colbert de Torcy, where Philo oversaw nearly all the interior design. Such an expensive venture is unlikely to go down well with Burberry\u2019s shareholders, but Gobbetti has a strong track record. Having secured a masters degree in international management before joining the fashion world as a sales director at Bottega Veneta, Gobbetti has built up a wealth of experience in retail, particularly the vital leather goods sector. Handbags have been a key earner in the luxury market, although there are concerns that fashion companies have pushed prices to the limit. A typical C\u00e9line bag costs about \u00a31,500, while an average Burberry bag is about \u00a31,100. After leaving Bottega Veneta, Gobbetti became managing director of Italian leather goods brand Valextra, before moving to Moschino in 1993 and then Givenchy. The discreetly expensive world of C\u00e9line produced a turnover of less than \u20ac700m (\u00a3584m), according to analysts, against Burberry\u2019s \u00a32.5bn. In the luxury fashion sector, Burberry represents mass appeal, and sales tactics vary accordingly. While C\u00e9line\u2019s advertising has featured cult octogenarian writer Joan Didion, Burberry counts Emma Watson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Eddie Redmayne among its models, with 17-year-old Brooklyn Beckham hired to take the pictures. Gobbetti and Philo closed more stores than they opened as they focused on making each outlet reflect the brand\u2019s high standards. Burberry has forged ahead with new store openings around the world as it has tried to cater to Chinese demand and a shift in spending from Hong Kong to Japan. C\u00e9line has also resisted e-commerce and digital marketing, even discouraging its runway models from taking backstage photographs to post on Instagram. In an interview with WSJ magazine last year, Gobbetti said: \u201cWe think it is important to touch the clothes. Much of what is special is lost on e-commerce.\u201d In contrast, under Bailey, Burberry picked up on the digital revolution early, streaming its fashion shows live and pioneering the \u201csee now, buy now\u201d trend, where clothes from this September\u2019s catwalk show onwards will be available to purchase immediately online. Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said Gobbetti will have to adapt quickly. \u201cThe least digital manager of all the luxury brand managers is taking over responsibility for the most digital brand and he will have to get his act together on that. Digital is the shape of things to come and I don\u2019t think Burberry will be making a U-turn on that,\u201d he said. Bailey has said he led the recruitment of Gobbetti and was happy to give up his CEO title in order to secure the additional skills that Burberry needed. Rogerio Fujimori, a luxury goods analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: \u201cAs the luxury goods market slows down, Burberry\u2019s story will be more focused on retail productivity and cost savings, and there were some management skills missing at Burberry.\u201d In their new partnership, Gobbetti will oversee the commercial, financial and operational side of the business, while Bailey will focus on creative, design, marketing and communication. They will manage strategy and the creation of their team together. Solca said Gobbetti\u2019s appointment might free up Bailey to focus on more exciting design ideas, something that Burberry badly needs to get the brand back on track. But he believes that Bailey might find Gobbetti to be somewhat of a nemesis. If the British designer cannot give Burberry a creative shot in the arm, Gobbetti is likely to follow brands such as Gucci and Dior in bringing in a new designer. \u201cCreative directors are artists and they tend to produce variations on a theme. If you listen to Sting all the time, it sounds more or less the same. If you want to have a jolt of excitement, you may have to change the artist,\u201d Solca said.",

      "body": "<p>Marco Gobbetti is the quiet man behind C\u00e9line, the minimalist luxury brand that brought normcore to the catwalk. Now, after his appointment as chief executive of Burberry, the British fashion company is in the unusual position of having two bosses.</p> <p>Following pressure from shareholders, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/burberrys-christopher-bailey-new-ceo-celine-marco-gobbetti\">Christopher Bailey is moving to one side</a> as the company seeks to turn around its flagging performance with additional retail and operational expertise.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s biggest luxury label has run into problems. When Bailey<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/16/christopher-bailey-angela-ahrendts-burberry-ceo\"> took over as chief executive</a> in 2013, while retaining his role as chief creative officer, the brand was motoring, driven by seemingly insatiable demand for anything with Burberry\u2019s trademark beige check from Chinese shoppers. But an economic slowdown and a crackdown on conspicuous consumption, together with limits on travel to the shopping mecca of Hong Kong following pro-democracy demonstrations, have harmed trade. Its shares have fallen from 1,908p to 1,203p.</p> <p>The focus has shifted to cost cutting, streamlining the business and pulling in more shoppers to existing stores. Shareholders had been worried that Bailey lacked the right skills for these tasks.</p> <p>Gobbetti is a management expert with a long pedigree in managing luxury businesses. He has had stints at C\u00e9line, Moschino and Givenchy, and was signed up with \u00a34m in shares as a golden handshake.</p> <p>He is relatively low profile, but C\u00e9line is a commercial success story, having enjoyed double-digit sales growth and strong profits at a time when its peers have been struggling.</p> <p>The French label is highly regarded, so much so that fashion editors wear it. It\u2019s a favourite label on the front row and a hot ticket at Paris fashion week, partly thanks to the company\u2019s British designer Phoebe Philo, who has created a signature style that is minimal, chic and reassuringly expensive. </p> <p>Gobbetti, working with Philo since her appointment as creative director in 2008, was the silent partner in the success of the brand, allowing Philo to concentrate on designing, while he worked on the business strategy that emphasised the discreet and rarified image of C\u00e9line. </p> <p>Bailey has described the new set up \u2013 he has been given the title of president \u2013 as \u201ca partnership built on respect and working collaboratively together\u201d. He may have been attracted to Gobbetti\u2019s apparent knack for working alongside creative types. Gobbetti partnered Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy before joining up successfully with Philo. </p> <p>Bailey and Gobbetti will earn the same base salary of \u00a31.1m, although Gobbetti will receive an annual cash allowance of \u00a380,000 to cover his travel, car and clothing, compared with Bailey\u2019s \u00a3464,000 a year in benefits. The incoming chief executive could receive nearly \u00a37m in the year ahead if he hits targets for his annual bonus, worth double his salary, and a long-term share bonus of 3.25 times his salary.</p> <p>Bailey may relish the creative freedom that Gobbetti allowed at the C\u00e9line head office, which he created in a Parisian neoclassical mansion known as the <a href=\"http://habituallychic.luxury/2015/03/the-house-that-celine-built/\">H\u00f4tel Colbert de Torcy</a>, where Philo oversaw nearly all the interior design. Such an expensive venture is unlikely to go down well with Burberry\u2019s shareholders, but Gobbetti has a strong track record.</p> <p>Having secured a masters degree in international management before joining the fashion world as a sales director at Bottega Veneta, Gobbetti has built up a wealth of experience in retail, particularly the vital leather goods sector. Handbags have been a key earner in the luxury market, although there are concerns that fashion companies have pushed prices to the limit. A typical C\u00e9line bag costs about \u00a31,500, while an average Burberry bag is about \u00a31,100. </p> <p>After leaving Bottega Veneta, Gobbetti became managing director of Italian leather goods brand Valextra, before moving to Moschino in 1993 and then Givenchy.<br></p> <p>The discreetly expensive world of C\u00e9line produced a turnover of less than \u20ac700m (\u00a3584m), according to analysts, against Burberry\u2019s \u00a32.5bn.</p> <p>In the luxury fashion sector, Burberry represents mass appeal, and sales tactics vary accordingly. While C\u00e9line\u2019s advertising has featured cult octogenarian writer Joan Didion, Burberry counts Emma Watson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Eddie Redmayne among its models, with 17-year-old Brooklyn Beckham hired to take the pictures.</p> <p>Gobbetti and Philo closed more stores than they opened as they focused on making each outlet reflect the brand\u2019s high standards. Burberry has forged ahead with new store openings around the world as it has tried to cater to Chinese demand and a shift in spending from Hong Kong to Japan.</p> <p>C\u00e9line has also resisted e-commerce and digital marketing, even discouraging its runway models from taking backstage photographs to post on Instagram. In an interview with WSJ magazine last year, Gobbetti said: \u201cWe think it is important to touch the clothes. Much of what is special is lost on e-commerce.\u201d</p> <p>In contrast, under Bailey, Burberry picked up on the digital revolution early, streaming its fashion shows live and pioneering the \u201csee now, buy now\u201d trend, where clothes from this September\u2019s catwalk show onwards will be available to purchase immediately online. </p> <p>Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said Gobbetti will have to adapt quickly. \u201cThe least digital manager of all the luxury brand managers is taking over responsibility for the most digital brand and he will have to get his act together on that. Digital is the shape of things to come and I don\u2019t think Burberry will be making a U-turn on that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Bailey has said he led the recruitment of Gobbetti and was happy to give up his CEO title in order to secure the additional skills that Burberry needed. </p> <p>Rogerio Fujimori, a luxury goods analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: \u201cAs the luxury goods market slows down, Burberry\u2019s story will be more focused on retail productivity and cost savings, and there were some management skills missing at Burberry.\u201d</p> <p>In their new partnership, Gobbetti will oversee the commercial, financial and operational side of the business, while Bailey will focus on creative, design, marketing and communication. They will manage strategy and the creation of their team together.</p> <p>Solca said Gobbetti\u2019s appointment might free up Bailey to focus on more exciting design ideas, something that Burberry badly needs to get the brand back on track. </p> <p>But he believes that Bailey might find Gobbetti to be somewhat of a nemesis. If the British designer cannot give Burberry a creative shot in the arm, Gobbetti is likely to follow brands such as Gucci and Dior in bringing in a new designer. \u201cCreative directors are artists and they tend to produce variations on a theme. If you listen to Sting all the time, it sounds more or less the same. If you want to have a jolt of excitement, you may have to change the artist,\u201d Solca said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "By the end of the Treasury select committee\u2019s session, Mark Carney looked as if he could happily punch his chief tormentor, the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. It was the umpteenth time Carney had been called upon to defend the Bank of England\u2019s honour over how it acted during the referendum campaign, and the governor was irritated. \u201cThose who cast it [the Bank\u2019s independence] into question should consider their motivations and their judgments,\u201d said Carney pointedly. That was a swing at Rees-Mogg and those Tory grandees who had accused the Bank of peddling \u201cphoney forecasts\u201d and \u201cscare stories\u201d to help the remain campaign. Their number includes two former chancellors, Lords Lawson and Lamont, and two former Tory leaders, Lord Howard and Iain Duncan Smith. Carney should calm down \u2013 but he deserves sympathy in this squabble. Judged on public comments, he and the Bank behaved properly. It would have been absurd for Threadneedle Street, charged with promoting monetary and financial stability, to somehow pretend that the referendum was not happening. The vote raised big questions for both remits. The Bank was obliged to assess the likely consequences. The Bank judged Brexit to be the biggest domestic risk to financial stability. It said there could be a \u201cmaterial slowdown in growth\u201d and even a technical recession, and it warned that interest rates could rise if falling sterling threatened to produce \u201ca notable rise in inflation\u201d. One could dispute elements of that analysis \u2013 a rise in interest rates was always unlikely \u2013 but, in its general thrust, the Bank\u2019s assessment was almost humdrum. It was judging risks, not making concrete forecasts. The central question is whether the Bank dishonestly skewed its analysis to suit George Osborne and his colleagues. There is zero evidence to suggest so. As Carney argues, the Bank\u2019s work and conclusions were overseen by two full policy committees, including outside members. If there was a stitch-up, a lot of people would have had to participate or be fooled. It seems unlikely. The only reason to overturn that view is if the governor engaged in nudge-winkery with Osborne. Thus it is good that Carney has agreed \u2013 albeit only after a sharp prod from the chair, Andrew Tyrie \u2013 to release to the committee notes of his private conversations with the chancellor. If there is a smoking gun, that is where it will be found. If none is discovered, however, it is time for this tedious row to be laid to rest. On the available facts, the Bank just did its job. Could Italy wipe out ordinary savers? The cracks in the Italian banking system are wide. The International Monetary Fund judges non-performing loans to represent 18% of total loanbooks. The need for more capital is urgent. But is the rescue process not well understood in the EU these days? You clear the decks by wiping out the bondholders, the folk who everybody swore would never be bailed out again. The cleansing process allows fresh capital, attracted by the removal of a layer of liabilities, to rush in. Well, that\u2019s the theory. The problem in Italy is that following the rules is almost bound to create fresh turmoil. The banks have sold about 30% of their bonds to retail investors \u2013 ordinary savers. If the nest eggs of tens of thousands of Italians are evaporated on the orders of the EU, the consequences are unknown. In one plausible scenario, the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, could lose October\u2019s referendum on constitutional reform and be forced to resign, paving the way for the Five Star Movement to make big gains on an anti-euro ticket. Thus there is a desperate attempt to bend the rules and find a way to bail out the banks, and their bondholders, anyway. For now, the EU is officially appalled. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup council of finance minsters, says the rules are strict and creditors must face losses \u201cotherwise everything we have agreed in Europe will be questioned\u201d. Dream on. There is no way Italy will be forced to wipe out ordinary investors. The EU will find a fudge to avoid a fresh political crisis. The rulebook will be ignored and state-aid rules by-passed. That is how the game always works. But Dijsselbloem is right on the moral of the tale: faith in EU promises about bank rescues will drop yet another notch. May should name and shame on pay Call Theresa May: pay for the bosses of big European banks rose 9.6% last year to $10.4m (\u00a37.9m), according to an analysis by the consultants Equilar and the FT. The incoming prime minister, and now opponent-in-chief of excessive boardroom pay, arrives in Downing Street too late to name and shame those UK bankers who contributed to the haul. But, when the time comes, that will be a useful tactic. Theorising is nice, but criticism carries more force \u2013 and deterrent value \u2013 when it\u2019s personal and comes from the PM.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is offering small investors a direct line to the boardroom with the creation of a shareholder panel to scrutinise performance. The plan was announced on Tuesday by the M&amp;S chairman, Robert Swannell, at its annual investor meeting, where management regularly faces fierce criticism of its underperforming clothing business which last week reported its biggest fall in sales since the 2008 banking crisis. \u201cWe want to listen to you and take you with us as we change Marks &amp; Spencer,\u201d he said. The retailer has already held trial events including a lunch and tea party, with a guest list drawn from vocal AGM regulars. The meetings had delivered some \u201cperceptive observations\u201d, Swannell said, although a short video of highlights included comments such as \u201ctoo much pastel [coloured]\u201d clothing and a need to \u201csparkle up\u201d designs for older women. The shareholder meeting was the first for Steve Rowe as chief executive. Rowe, who took over from Marc Bolland in the spring, and has worked at M&amp;S for 26 years, has pledged to turn around the clothing business by improving ranges and availability, cutting prices and offering fewer promotions. \u201cI know that it\u2019s a big ask for me to stand here today with a new set of ideas and ask you to trust me that things will be different this time,\u201d he said of the plan, which will hit sales and profits in the short term. \u201c[But] I firmly believe that we can return our clothing business to positive growth.\u201d M&amp;S reported a 8.9% fall in underlying clothing and home sales in three months to 2 July as Rowe axed 28 promotions. Last year, more than 40% of its clothing was sold on promotion. It is imperative the retailer comes off \u201cthe drug that is discounting and sale\u201d, he said. Setting out his turnaround plan in May, Rowe promised to better serve the company\u2019s most loyal group of shoppers, dubbed \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d. These fiftysomething women had been neglected as the retailer chased younger shoppers, but Rowe promised to \u201ccherish and listen to her\u201d.

It was in my opinion the most disastrous piece of marketing since Gerald Ratner extolled the virtues of his silver-plated dinner set.\u201d She added: \u201cWe don\u2019t live in a world where women dress from head to toe in one brand. We\u2019re individuals and don\u2019t like to be labelled especially when it identifies you with a failing retailer.\u201d The M&amp;S annual reports lists 165,727 private shareholders but the use of nominee accounts means the number is far higher, with the group speaking for about 30% of its shares.

They are believed to be among a hardcore keen to get involved. M&amp;S said it had not yet decided how to sift applications or the panel\u2019s remit. M&amp;S shares have lost 38% of their value in the past year and some shareholders questioned Bolland\u2019s legacy at the meeting. The former chief executive earned \u00a317m over his six-year stint although the most recent annual report revealed the board cut his final bonus by a fifth.

At the revealing of its full-year results, the retailer announced a special dividend of 4.6p a share, or a total of \u00a375m. \u201cThere are areas of our business where we should have done better but our business is immeasurably stronger than it was,\u201d Swannell added on Tuesday.",

      "bodyText": "Sterling tumbling, gilt yields at near record lows, balance of payments dire, business confidence flatlining: no wonder Mark Carney brought the eleven horsemen \u2013 and women \u2013 of the apocalypse with him to the Treasury select committee. The Bank of England governor usually just makes do with a couple of flunkeys \u2013 just as a precaution, to make sure he doesn\u2019t nod off \u2013 to these meetings; for this one he\u2019d come mob-handed with an entire football team. Carney often appears to be in a state of suspended animation, hovering in a blissed-out no-man\u2019s land of semi-conscious unconsciousness, but for this appearance he was fired up. By which I mean his eyes were open throughout and the occasional flash of red peeped through his permatanned complexion; the governor isn\u2019t one to waste energy. But he was definitely annoyed. For the past three years his sole purpose in life had been to do absolutely nothing, but for the past couple of months he had been rushed off his feet. If he\u2019d known there was going to be a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, he\u2019d never have taken the job. Proceedings got under way with committee chairman Andrew Tyrie reminding Carney that in the run-up to the referendum two former chancellors \u2013 Norman Lamont and Nigel Lawson \u2013 along with two former Tory party leaders \u2013 Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard \u2013 had accused the Bank of England of lacking credibility and independence by \u2018peddling phoney forecasts\u2019 about the economic consequences of Brexit. \u201cWhy do you think they said that?\u201d he asked. Carney\u2019s eyes replied, \u201dbecause all four of them are total halfwits who shouldn\u2019t even be trusted to run a PayPal account\u201d; his voice drawled: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask them.\u201d Fair-minded as ever, Tyrie tried to balance things out by pointing out that not every Brexit-supporting politician had been quite so scathing about Carney\u2019s efforts to stop the British economy from hitting the rocks. \u201cBoris Johnson says you\u2019ve been doing a marvellous job,\u201d he observed. A thumbs-up from the man who has managed to be wrong about almost everything in the past few weeks wasn\u2019t quite the endorsement he would have liked. But what the hell? \u201cAny port in a storm,\u201d he said. It was like this, he continued. There had been no stitch-up between the Bank and George Osborne to terrify the country; all his forecasts had been entirely robust and \u2013 much to his astonishment \u2013 completely correct. As far as he knew, he was the first economist in living memory to have been accurate about anything. If he wasn\u2019t such a laid-back dude, it could have been enough to make him doubt himself. The pro-Brexit Jacob Rees-Mogg was unconcerned that Carney\u2019s forecasts had been right; his complaint was that they had been made at all. The usually sane Jacob seems to have subscribed to an obscure offshoot of solipsistic phenomenology in which thoughts are automatically transformed into an external reality. If only the Bank of England had just kept its mouth shut, then there would never have been a run on the pound. That approach hadn\u2019t worked out too well when the Bank had buried its head in the sand in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, but there was always a first time. Carney just couldn\u2019t win. The Brexiters were accusing him of doing far too much in the run-up to the referendum and the Remainers were hinting that he hadn\u2019t done nearly enough to stave off disaster in its aftermath. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves queried whether the extra \u00a3150bn of lending the bank had made available would keep a recession at bay. \u201cIt should be more than fine,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause everyone is so terrified at the moment no one wants to borrow anything.\u201d Sod it, he thought. He\u2019d had enough of being given a hard time. He was ready for some revenge. Time to bore the committee to death. \u201cCounter-cyclical contagion \u2026 Challenges to Italy at the acute end of the spectrum\u2026 I want to broaden the broader contagion problem\u2026 Thirty years of stagnation.\u201d That last remark was aimed just as much at the committee as the economy.",

    "webTitle": "Philip May: the reserved City fixture and husband happy to take a back seat", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip May is known in politics as a man who has taken a back seat and allowed his wife, Theresa, to shine. His reputation in the City is very similar. The husband of the incoming prime minister has been a fixture in the Square Mile since the 1980s, when the City became known for brash yuppies, but Philip May has always belonged to the more reserved old school. A colleague at Capital Group, the US fund manager where May handles relationships with its clients, said: \u201cHe often chairs meetings and does a very good job of making sure that everybody has their say. \u201cAround the office, he is a fairly head down type of guy. There is a stereotypical investment manager with a big ego \u2013 he\u2019s not like that at all. He is fairly quiet, keeps himself to himself. He has very good integrity and never trades off his wife\u2019s name.\u201d A Conservative party source said: \u201cTheresa May is the most unclubbable of politicians \u2013 and he is incredibly quiet. At party conferences, he is always three or four paces behind her and very happy not to be in the limelight.\u201d While there are some echoes of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s husband, Denis, in this description, it also suggests that socially, the two men are very different. Denis Thatcher\u2019s image, of course, was primarily derived from Private Eye\u2019s Dear Bill columns, which first appeared in the satirical magazine two weeks after his wife acquired the keys to No 10 and were imaginary letters supposedly penned to his friend Lord Deedes, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph. Since then, it has been assumed that he was a gin-soaked, golf-obsessed halfwit whose sole aim in life was to sneak another snifter, but May\u2019s appetites appear to be quite different. Certainly, he is not known for hitting the bars after work and is understood to prefer cricket. \u201cHe would just head home,\u201d one City colleague said. The quiet man image is true within May\u2019s low-key industry. If there are such things as star names in fund management, they tend to be the people who make big punts on behalf of their clients. However, May no longer invests money on behalf of pension funds of large corporations or local authorities, instead filling the role of go-between. He is the man who explains why the fund managers have made the bets that they have, presumably taking the flak when it all goes wrong. It has not always been like this for May. After starting his City career at stockbroker de Zoete &amp; Bevan, where he worked from 1979 to 1983, May moved on to Prudential, staying until 2000, where he invested money for pension funds of major companies, known as segregated pension funds, as well as managing relations with clients. There, May experienced the usual highs and lows of City life. In the final days of 1999, his views on investment prospects were sought after enough for him to be featured in the Times, making his predictions of what the financial markets might do the following year. There he was quoted, perhaps ironically, as being \u201cmore inspired by [investments in] continental Europe, as devaluation of the euro opens up export opportunities, and [he] is particularly enthusiastic about cyclical stocks in Germany and Sweden\u201d. His reputation as a stock picker came after a coup in 1998 when, as head of pension funds at Prudential Portfolio Managers, he collected a fund management award at the Extels, known as the \u201cCity\u2019s Oscars\u201d. However, two years later, PPM attracted the attention of the trade press when it was ditched by its client Associated British Foods because \u201cthe performance ... was not satisfactory\u201d. In 2000, May was one of the three from the 11-strong institutional equity team who survived when Prudential, having acquired rival M&amp;G a year earlier, sold some of its fund management business to Deutsche Asset Management. He was transferred to the German bank and remained there for a further five years, before Deutsche\u2019s UK investment operation was acquired by Aberdeen Asset Management, swelling the funds under its management by \u00a340bn. In 2005, May left to join Capital Group, a fund management business founded in Los Angeles in 1931, which has $1.4tn (\u00a31.1tn) under management, but has remained largely unknown in the UK, outside the City of London, since opening an office in the capital in 1979. A spokesman for Capital said: \u201cPhilip is a client relationship manager who stays in contact with clients to ensure they are happy with the service being delivered by Capital Group and that we understand their goals. Philip is not involved with our investment research or portfolio management activities.\u201d While it is not particularly well known, the company has a reputation in the trade for making large bets on companies, according to City sources.",

      "body": "<p>Philip May is known in politics as a man who has taken a back seat and allowed his wife, Theresa, to shine. His reputation in the City is very similar.</p> <p>The husband of the incoming prime minister has been a fixture in the Square Mile since the 1980s, when the City became known for brash yuppies, but Philip May has always belonged to the more reserved old school.</p> <p>A colleague at Capital Group, the US fund manager where May handles relationships with its clients, said: \u201cHe often chairs meetings and does a very good job of making sure that everybody has their say.</p> <p>\u201cAround the office, he is a fairly head down type of guy. There is a stereotypical investment manager with a big ego \u2013 he\u2019s not like that at all. He is fairly quiet, keeps himself to himself. He has very good integrity and never trades off his wife\u2019s name.\u201d</p> <p>A Conservative party source said: \u201cTheresa May is the most unclubbable of politicians \u2013 and he is incredibly quiet. At party conferences, he is always three or four paces behind her and very happy not to be in the limelight.\u201d</p> <p>While there are some echoes of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s husband, Denis, in this description, it also suggests that socially, the two men are very different.</p> <p>Denis Thatcher\u2019s image, of course, was primarily derived from Private Eye\u2019s Dear Bill columns, which first appeared in the satirical magazine two weeks after his wife acquired the keys to No 10 and were imaginary letters supposedly penned to his friend Lord Deedes, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>Since then, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1996/feb/26/past.fromthearchive\">it has been assumed</a> that he was a gin-soaked, golf-obsessed halfwit whose sole aim in life was to sneak another snifter, but May\u2019s appetites appear to be quite different. Certainly, he is not known for hitting the bars after work and is understood to prefer cricket. \u201cHe would just head home,\u201d one City colleague said.</p> <p>The quiet man image is true within May\u2019s low-key industry. If there are such things as star names in fund management, they tend to be the people who make big punts on behalf of their clients. However, May no longer invests money on behalf of pension funds of large corporations or local authorities, instead filling the role of go-between. He is the man who explains why the fund managers have made the bets that they have, presumably taking the flak when it all goes wrong.</p> <p>It has not always been like this for May. After starting his City career at stockbroker de Zoete &amp; Bevan, where he worked from 1979 to 1983, May moved on to Prudential, staying until 2000, where he invested money for pension funds of major companies, known as segregated pension funds, as well as managing relations with clients. There, May experienced the usual highs and lows of City life.</p> <p>In the final days of 1999, his views on investment prospects were sought after enough for him to be featured in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/thetimes\">the Times</a>, making his predictions of what the financial markets might do the following year.</p> <p>There he was quoted, perhaps ironically, as being \u201cmore inspired by [investments in] continental Europe, as devaluation of the euro opens up export opportunities, and [he] is particularly enthusiastic about cyclical stocks in Germany and Sweden\u201d. </p> <p>His reputation as a stock picker came after a coup in 1998 when, as head of pension funds at Prudential Portfolio Managers, he collected a fund management award at the Extels, known as the \u201cCity\u2019s Oscars\u201d. However, two years later, PPM attracted the attention of the trade press when it was ditched by its client Associated British Foods because \u201cthe performance ... was not satisfactory\u201d.</p> <p>In 2000, May was one of the three from the 11-strong institutional equity team who survived when Prudential, having acquired rival M&amp;G a year earlier, sold some of its fund management business to Deutsche Asset Management.</p> <p>He was transferred to the German bank and remained there for a further five years, before Deutsche\u2019s UK investment operation was acquired by Aberdeen Asset Management, swelling the funds under its management by \u00a340bn.</p> <p>In 2005, May left to join Capital Group, a fund management business founded in Los Angeles in 1931, which has $1.4tn (\u00a31.1tn) under management, but has remained largely unknown in the UK, outside the City of London, since opening an office in the capital in 1979.</p> <p>A spokesman for Capital said: \u201cPhilip is a client relationship manager who stays in contact with clients to ensure they are happy with the service being delivered by Capital Group and that we understand their goals. Philip is not involved with our investment research or portfolio management activities.\u201d</p> <p>While it is not particularly well known, the company has a reputation in the trade for making large bets on companies, according to City sources.</p>",

Estimates that up to \u00a35bn of warehouses, office blocks and shopping centres could be put on the market were made last week and Richard Sharp, a Bank of England policymaker, told MPs on the Treasury select committee that funds were starting to consider selling properties. Seven UK commercial property funds have taken steps to either suspend dealing or cut valuations in response to the 23 June referendum, which has sparked fears that commercial property will be a less attractive investment. The Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, last week warned funds not to race into fire sales to ensure that some investors were not financially penalised by the offloading of property. Henderson Global Investors would not comment on reports that TH Real Estate, which manages its property fund, was preparing to sell 440 The Strand, in London, the distinctive office of Coutts, the private banking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland. Henderson is among the funds to have suspended dealings and the Coutts office was bought in 2014 for \u00a3175m, according to reports. Aberdeen Asset Management, which aims to resume dealings in its property fund on Wednesday after cutting its value by 17%, said it was looking at the sale of a number of properties. Gerry Ferguson, head of Aberdeen\u2019s UK property pooled funds, said: \u201cFollowing a period of higher than normal redemptions from the fund after the EU referendum result and the suspension of other funds\u2019 trading, the fund is now seeking to rebuild its liquidity position. A limited number of properties are being marketed and we will seek the highest prices achievable for our investors as is our normal practice.\u201d No details were given but a BT office in Leicestershire was among the properties Aberdeen was said to be considering selling along with an office development in Hammersmith. However, some big commercial property deals have been announced since the referendum result. Last week British Land announced it had sold the Oxford Street branch of Debenhams for \u00a3400m to an unnamed private investor. It did not given details of any profit made from the sale of the seven-storey flagship department-store building. The Bank of England has been on alert for problems in the commercial property sector and has already outlined possible risks from the kind of funds that are being suspended. These so-called open ended funds allow instant access to funds but are based on assets \u2013 property \u2013 that are difficult to sell. The Bank\u2019s half-yearly assessment of risks to the financial system, published last week, showed that there had been sharp slowdown in activity in commercial property between January and June when prices were flat. Foreign investors, who have fuelled the market since the financial crisis when it was dominated by UK banks, had cut their investments in the first quarter of 2016. The FCA had told the Bank of England about the possibility of suspension of funds following the referendum and its new chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said last week the structure of these funds might need to be changed.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The top 350 US CEOs earned 5.1% less last year than in 2014, bringing home an average of just $15.5m, according to a report from the Economic Policy Institute. The dip in earnings had little to do with the increased attention to income inequality or discrepancy in pay between top executives and low-wage workers. Instead it\u2019s all down to last year\u2019s turbulent stock market. The report, released on Tuesday by the left-leaning firm, comes at a time when both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow have reached new record highs. After analyzing pay packages \u2013 including salaries, bonuses, incentive payouts and stock options \u2013 of chief executives at the top 350 firms, EPI found that about 83% of decline in CEO pay was due to the drop in value of realized stock options in that period. \u201cThe stock price of any given company is largely a reflection of the stock market overall, not its CEO\u2019s performance,\u201d said Lawrence Mishel, EPI president and co-author of the report. \u201cWe see that in the way that average CEO pay tracked the stock market in 2015. CEO compensation will likely resume its upward trajectory when the stock market moves up again.\u201d On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at a record high of 2,137.16, topping its previous record of 2,132.8 set in May 2015. On Tuesday, it opened at a new record high of 2,146.29. The Dow also opened at a new record high, peaking at 18,359. A healthy stock market could signal higher CEO pay in 2016. In 2015, top CEOs took home 276 times more earnings than typical workers. In 2014, however, their compensation was 302 times that of average workers. Despite the very modest dip in pay,CEOs are still earning a lot more than they have been in the past. According to EPI, from 1978 to 2015, inflation-adjusted compensation of top CEOs increased by 940.9%.

      "bodyText": "Airbus and Rolls-Royce, two of the biggest manufacturers in Britain, have warned that the government needs to swiftly secure favourable terms in trade negotiations with Europe to avoid jeopardising investment in the UK. Rolls-Royce said it has held \u201chigh-level\u201d talks with ministers about the areas that it is keen to resolve after the Brexit vote, while the UK boss of Airbus said he did not want to deal with thousands of pages of documents and tariffs when dealing with his colleagues in mainland Europe. Airbus, which makes the A380 superjumbo, employs 15,000 people in Britain and issued some of the gravest warnings about the consequences of a vote to leave the EU in the run-up to the referendum. Speaking at the Farnborough airshow, leading figures from the Franco-German company and other major aerospace groups said they remained committed to their existing UK operations. Tom Williams, chief operating officer of Airbus\u2019s commercial planes unit, said on Tuesday that nothing had changed at the company in the short term, but it would have to make \u201cbig decisions\u201d in three years\u2019 time about investing in Britain, where Airbus makes wings for the A380 in Broughton, north Wales. \u201cWe haven\u2019t pulled back on investment in the months running up to Brexit. We have no major decisions on the horizon, which gives us two-three years for the whole thing to settle down. But then there will be big decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a situation that is no less favourable than now. When I build a set of wings in Broughton and send them to Toulouse, I don\u2019t need a thousand pages of documents and tariffs. That\u2019s not just for me, but all UK industries. \u201cWith Brexit, nothing has changed in the short term, but of course future investment does come under review. But we could see a situation where we are in a positive scenario.\u201d Engine maker Rolls-Royce stressed that it was keen to secure agreements on the movement of labour, environmental standards and aviation regulations. Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, warned that the main potential downside of Brexit for the company was uncertainty. Three-quarters of Rolls-Royce\u2019s business is done outside the EU. \u201cThey [circumstances] may play out in an advantageous way, but it will be some years until we know,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the chief executive of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg, said Brexit would not change its approach to investing in the UK. The US aircraft manufacturer announced on Monday that it is doubling the size of its British business, creating 2,000 jobs. \u201cWe have been here for 75 years and we have a very long-term perspective on our investment in the UK. So Brexit and some of the recent activities here doesn\u2019t change that. We are going to maintain that long-term perspective and it doesn\u2019t change our plans,\u201d Muilenburg said. Separate from Brexit, East raised the possibility of further cost reductions and job losses at the company as it undergoes restructuring. East has targeted up to \u00a3200m of annual savings by the end of 2017, but internal documents show that Rolls-Royce could earn an extra \u00a31bn by boosting its profit margins, which would include further cost-cutting. \u201cI do not see any reason why we cannot achieve the sort of benchmark margin levels and that would imply that sort of number [\u00a31bn], but it is not a fixed target. We will come out with another target when we have got something that we are sufficiently confident in that we can talk about tying a number to a period of time; like we have talked about \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m by the end of 2017. I do not want to come out with some sort of vague, hand-wavy \u2018it\u2019s a billion pounds ... sometime ... never\u2019. \u201cOne of the challenges we mentioned back in February with our full-year results is that we have to rebuild investor trust and you do not build trust by having hand-wavy arguments that nobody can really test you against.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Serena Williams, the 2016 Wimbledon women\u2019s champion, has become a surprise casualty of the economic fallout from the Brexit vote. The American tennis player racked up a straight-sets victory over Angelique Kerber in the final on Saturday, winning \u00a32m ($2.63m) in prize money. However, the sum would have been worth $2.97m on 23 June, the day of the EU referendum, the result of which sent the pound plunging on currency markets. It means that Williams, 34, lost out on $340,000, along with about $33,000 that was knocked off her share of the prize money for winning the women\u2019s doubles with her sister Venus. The financial blow was partly cushioned by an inflation-busting 7% increase in Wimbledon singles prize money from \u00a31.88m last year, when Serena also won the women\u2019s title. However, the decline in the value of sterling means that she will take home less in dollars this year than in 2015. The pound has fallen by about 10% since the day after the referendum as traders sell the currency on the expectation of an economic slowdown and interest rate cuts. On 24 June, sterling had its biggest fall in recent history, and it has since touched a series of 31-year lows against the dollar. Williams is unlikely to lose too much sleep over the effect of sterling\u2019s fall on her Wimbledon earnings. She is the highest-earning female tennis player, having won $81m in prize money, a figure that she has supplemented with endorsements and other earnings. Her seventh Wimbledon singles victory made Williams the third-biggest prizewinner in tennis history, behind Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.",

      "bodyText": "Hotel Chocolat has said the post-Brexit vote surge in the price of cocoa will not mean customers have to pay more for its upmarket chocolate products. The chocolatier said it had seen no change in trading since the referendum result and insisted that its business would weather a likely economic slowdown. In Hotel Chocolat\u2019s first trading update since floating on the stock market, it said revenue in the year to 26 June rose by 12% to \u00a392.6m \u2013 slightly better than expected. Hotel Chocolat shares floated in May at 148p each. They jumped to 210p soon after as investors sought to buy into the trend for consumers pay more for food products they perceive to be of higher quality. The shares fell heavily after Britain voted to leave the EU; however, at 178p, they are still above their offer price. The fall in the value of the pound since the referendum result was announced has helped push up the sterling price of cocoa, which reached a near-40 year high last week. If sustained, this could increase the cost of chocolate, of which the average UK person consumes 7.4kg (16.3lb) a year. Despite using more cocoa than most chocolate producers, Angus Thirlwell, the chief executive of Hotel Chocolat, said it would not feel the effect because the retailer buys cocoa a year ahead and is insured against rising prices. \u201cWe buy a wide variety of ingredients including hazelnuts, almonds, cherries, alcohol and sugar, and when one is up, another is down and broadly it balances out. There are also so many other things we can do, so we don\u2019t give our loyal consumers a nasty surprise,\u201d he said. Hotel Chocolat could, he added, expand its factory more quickly to gain economies of scale, or make further improvements to deliveries to increase efficiency, before raising prices. As retail industry figures showed that consumer spending slowed significantly in the run-up to the referendum, Thirlwell said he had seen no slowdown. Hotel Chocolat customers are relatively well off, its products are not a big purchase for them and they are loyal to the brand, which expanded during the financial crisis, he added. \u201cSince the end of June, we\u2019ve had another couple of weeks and trading has been in line with our expectations. The fact we\u2019ve been through a few more challenging trading environments historically and have managed to continue to grow in those environments means we can approach that not with confidence, but with resilience,\u201d Thirlwell said.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today, thank you for joining us. We\u2019ll be back again in the morning. AM US markets are up in early trading. Dow Jones: +0.4% at 18,295 S&amp;P 500: +0.4% at 2,146 Nasdaq: +0.6% at 5,018 Ireland\u2019s economy grew by a massive 26.3% in 2015, following a surge in foreign investment. A major boost came from foreign companies that switched their base to Ireland, increasing the value of the country\u2019s corporate sector. Michael Connolly, a senior statistician at Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office, said: What happens here is that an entire balance sheet of a company relocating to Ireland from somewhere else is included in our capital stocks or our international investment position. The very dramatic increase has increased the capacity for production in the economy and impacts the accounts for 2015 in the increase of exports and imports. Read our full story on the figures here: German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has been speaking in Brussels, where he joined other EU finance ministers for the latest Ecofin meeting. He called for Britain to be clear about its Brexit decision as soon as possible to limit long-term uncertainty. Speaking separately in Berlin, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her government\u2019s goal is to ensure Brexit does not have an impact in Germany. The FTSE 100 has risen above 6,700 for the first time since 11 August. Investors continue to be cheered by the swifter-than-expected conclusion to the Conservative Party leadership contest, with Theresa May confirmed on Tuesday as the UK\u2019s new PM. The FTSE is up 0.3% or 18 points at 6,701. The pound is up 1.2% against the dollar, at $1.3152. It is up 0.9% against the euro at \u20ac1.1850. Back in the wider world, European markets are higher. The FTSE 250 is up 0.6% at 16,803. Mark Carney came under considerable pressure from MPs, who quizzed him on the Bank\u2019s position in the lead up to the referendum on 23 June. It was the governor\u2019s first appearance in front of the Treasury Committee. Key points from the session: Carney said that by highlighting potential risks associated with Brexit he was representing the Bank\u2019s independent view, and not that of David Cameron or George Osborne. There was no political bias, he insisted. There was no discussion with the chancellor about any particular Brexit \u201cline\u201d to be taken by the Bank, the governor said. He said the move to relax the rules on how much capital banks must hold was not expected to be a \u201csilver bullet\u201d, addressing all the risks posed by the Brexit vote. But it would help to send a message to businesses and households that banks had money to lend. There will be no repeat of the credit crunch of 2008/2009. Consumers are also in a better position than they were before the crisis, with fewer debts. The Bank of England did not intervene in America\u2019s response to the HSBC files. A report in the US suggests the Department of Justice did not want to see legal proceedings against the bank because of the risks to financial stability. The Bank has the tools to ensure both monetary and financial stability, Carney said. He added the UK\u2019s exposure to the troubled Italian banking system was modest. The weaker pound could reduce Britain\u2019s current account deficit by about a third. Will the Brexit decision be negative for foreign direct investment over the long term, Tyrie asks Richard Sharp, an external member of the FPC? In the short to medium term yes, Sharp answers, in the longer term it will depend on policies and agreements struck. And that concludes the session. Full story and summary to follow. The governor says a weaker pound should improve the current account deficit, making it smaller. If maintained, the drop in the pound since the referendum would reduce the current account deficit by about a third, Carney estimates. Turning to the downsides of the Brexit vote for the current account, Carney includes the reduction in foreign investment in UK commercial property, and the \u201cmodest increase\u201d in risk premium associated with UK assets. When institutions try to bluff their way through risks, sweeping them under the carpet it is \u201cexactly the wrong thing to do\u201d, Carney says. Carney turns to the fall in the pound since the referendum. The exchange rate move can help the UK adjust to the post-Brexit environment, including the change in trade terms that will follow, the governor says. FPC member Donald Kohn says that if you are going to make a major decision to build a factory or open a new office in the UK, you would want to know what the terms of trading would be with other countries. Andrew Tyrie follows up by saying the Bank\u2019s MPC and FPC would have come in for considerable criticism had they not commented on the potential consequences of Brexit in the run up to the referendum. Deputy governor Cunliffe says the Bank\u2019s reputation would have been damaged if it had not warned of Brexit risks before the vote. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg is up. He clashed with Carney in the run-up to the referendum, accusing the governor of being in the pocket of the chancellor on the remain side of the campaign. Rees-Mogg asks whether the Bank must be like Caesar\u2019s wife, \u201cabove suspicion\u201d? The MP is pressing on with the idea that Carney showed political bias in the run-up to the referendum by arguing that being a member of the EU would be net beneficial for the UK economy. Carney rejects the idea. The Conservative MP is now taking Carney to task on his comment pre-referendum that UK rates could go either up or down in the event of a Brexit vote. Was it ever likely that policy would be tightened, Rees-Mogg asks, or did it just suit the chancellor\u2019s argument? Carney says the statement was a balanced view, reflecting the views of the MPC as a whole. The governor is keeping a fairly cool head in the face of some hostile questioning by Rees-Mogg. Carney gets the last word, suggesting those questioning whether the Bank was biased \u201cshould consider their [own] motivations their judgements?\u201d Markets are hedging \u201cdownside risk\u201d according to Carney, which is why we have seen record low bond yields. Low bond yields do not give an accurate signal of the future of the UK economy. \u201cThe financial system can withstand huge shocks. There will be growth\u201d. Carney is talking about the ultra low rates environment we are currently in. The governor suggests that the Bank still has tools up its sleeve should it need them. We have the tools to meet our responsibilities for both monetary and financial stability. Carney continues to sound the same reassuring note he has adopted since the Brexit result was known on 24 June. Economists believe the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will announce fresh measures to stimulate the UK economy - possibly as early as Thursday when it announces its monthly policy decision. The MPC could further cut interest rates (from 0.5%) or extend quantitative easing (from \u00a3375bn), or both. FPC member Donald Kohn says the most likely scenario of a rise in UK interest rates is a strong economy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be all bad news.\u201d Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for financial stability, says we have seen the beginning of financial markets putting a risk premium on UK assets. However, his FPC colleague Donald Kohn says this is limited, because the banks are better capitalised than they were in the run-up to the financial crisis. Carney says consumers are in a better position than they were in the run-up the crisis, less indebted. So households indebtedness now poses a smaller risk to financial stability. Labour\u2019s Mann asks the governor how the Bank might deal with the short term risks posed by a potential second referendum on Scottish independence. He says the issue of UK bank headquarters should be addressed well before any future decision on independence. Now to Italian banks. Carney says there is a macroeconomic risk posed by Italian banks and their bad loans and the Italian authorities are looking at it. The UK\u2019s exposure is \u201cmodest,\u201d the governor says. Labour MP John Mann is bringing Carney to task on property funds, and the fact the FPC was aware that investors were likely to withdraw large sums of money in the event of a Brexit vote. Why didn\u2019t the FPC do anything? Carney says that markets have created funds with daily liquidity that invest in illiquid assets (i.e. property). He says the FCA were aware and were looking at the issue. Tyrie now asks Donald Kohn about a Republican party report in the US that claims the Department of Justice did not want to see legal proceedings against the HSBC because of risks to financial stability. Should we be taking this seriously? Kohn says he has no specific knowledge of this situation. I wouldn\u2019t pass judgment until I heard the other side of the story. Tyrie to Carney: \u201cDid you discuss the matter with the chancellor? The allegation here is that UK authorities have been meddling.\u201d Carney says he was not involved in or aware of any alleged intervention on the HSBC case. (A reminder of the HSBC files here.) There will be no \u201ccredit crunch\u201d, unlike 2008/2009, according to the governor, because banks will have funds available to lend. Credit supply (lack of it) will not constrain the economy. Reeves says she worries that the relaxing of rules on bank\u2019s capital requirements are not going to be enough to save the economy post-Brexit. Carney says it\u2019s just one element of a bigger story: We would not represent this as a single silver bullet. It is part of a series of measures. Reeves says she is still worried about whether there will be a reduction in lending. Carney says that demand, not credit availability, is more likely to wane. We really want to make it as clear as possible to businesses and individuals that credit should be available for the right ideas, for the right transactions, be it a mortgage or a new business. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP, says the Bank was right to warn on Brexit risks before she moves on to the issue of counter-cyclical buffers. Carney says that by relaxing the rules for banks he wanted to \u201ctake off the table\u201d concerns about credit supply. \u201cThe banks are well capitalised.\u201d Now Tyrie is asking whether Carney would agree to the publication of records of any discussions the governor had with Osborne on the matter, in order to ease any fears of political bias the public might have. The governor says that he is prepared to look at how that can be done as long as it is within the public interest. Tyrie quips that lead Brexiteer Boris Johnson has credited Carney with doing a good job since the vote. Returning to serious mode, Carney says things are different in the current era, much more transparent. We don\u2019t keep things under wraps. The governor now has the chance to defend himself against the allegations. He describes the allegations as \u201cextraordinary\u201d. The chair [of the FPC] does not guide conclusions. The views of the FPC are the views of the FPC. What was in the March record are the views of the FPC, they are not pre-judged or pre-decided. Tyrie asks whether the Chancellor sought from Carney guidance on the likely \u201clines\u201d the Bank would take on the referendum. Carney says he didn\u2019t, that\u2019s not the way it works. David Kohn, an external member of the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, says the committee were in agreement on Brexit risks, and that there was no pressure on policymaker to take one view or another. We looked at the potential risks that might emerge from a leave vote. All of us agreed it was the biggest near term risk to financial stability The statement we put out at the end of March was a consensus opinion. Tyrie says he wants to address the allegation in the run-up to the referendum that the Bank attempted to scare voters about Brexit for political motives. Tyrie runs through the allegations, made by various politicians on the Leave side of the campaign. They claimed the governor was working in the interests of David Cameron and George Osborne, calling into question the independence of the Bank of England. Tyrie: That\u2019s a very serious allegation. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, makes the point that this is a significant moment, as it is the first opportunity for MP\u2019s to quiz the governor since the Brexit vote. Here we go. The governor and Bank colleagues take their seats. The Treasury Committee is late starting, we will be bringing you updates once it\u2019s underway... The full story on the FPC minutes from the Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor: Quick note before the governor starts... This from Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets on the relief among investors... The confirmation of a new UK Prime Minister has offered some welcome certainty in uncertain times. Theresa May as PM has produced no Mayday calls in markets. The \u201csafe hands\u201d of Mrs May at the helm has actually reduced distress signals. The pound has risen over 1% against the dollar today, adding to yesterday\u2019s gains when Andrea Leadsom ended her campaign to become the Tory party leader. The certainty of Theresa May stepping into the top job in UK politics ahead of schedule has had the perhaps unintuitive effect of weighing on UK stocks. It was the drop in sterling that cushioned the \u2018Brexit blow\u2019 because of its positive effect on UK company foreign earnings. Subsequently, the rebound in the pound is weighing on the FTSE 100, notably the big multinationals including Vodafone, GlaxoSmithKline and Diageo. Next up: Mark Carney appears at the Treasury Select Committee. Will there be fireworks as he faces his adversary Jacob Rees-Mogg, the MP and Brexit supporter ? The minutes from the Financial Policy Committee also reveal that policymakers were unanimous in the decision to cut banks\u2019 capital requirements following the EU referendum. Last week the FPC lowered a capital requirement for banks, affording them greater flexibility to absorb potential Brexit-related shocks. Bank of England was warned that investors were likely to pull large amounts of money out of commercial property funds following the Brexit vote. Minutes from the meeting of the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee on 28 June and 1 July (published here) reveal that policymakers were warned by the City regulator that funds might be suspended, which is exactly what happened. Since 4 July, seven funds have made moves to stop withdrawals either by suspending trading or reducing the value of the fund. The minutes reveal: The FPC was briefed by the Financial Conduct Authority on the extent of outflows from these funds and on the possibility that funds could suspend redemptions in the near term. The Bank also published two paragraphs that were redacted from the minutes of an earlier FPC meeting in March. The pars related to contingency planning in the run-up to the 23 June referendum and were deemed at the time to be against the public interest. Here are the paragraphs: Supervisors were engaging with banks, insurers and central counterparties on their contingency plans for risks related to the referendum, including for managing funding and liquidity risks in sterling and foreign currency. Several firms had reported that they were conducting stress tests with referendum related strategies of varying severity. UBS boss warns about potential job moves from the UK following the Brexit vote... Nintendo shares are up more than 50% in the three trading days since its Pok\u00e9mon Go game was launched. Nintendo\u2019s shares rose 12.8% to \u00a522,860 in Tokyo on Tuesday, taking total gains in the past three days to 53%. It means the market value of the company has jumped by \u00a37bn since the latest version of its 21-year-old game was made available on 7 July. Pok\u00e9mon Go is the first edition of the game for mobile phones and and lets players face the monsters in the real world using their smartphone cameras. Figures published overnight showed consumer spending slowed to recession levels in the run up to the EU referendum. High street and online sales were up 0.2% in June compared with the same month a year earlier according to the survey from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG. But sales were down 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the impact of sales at shops open for less than a year. Over the second quarter, sales were up 0.5% on the first quarter and 1.2% up on an annual basis. The BRC said this was the weakest performance since May 2009, when the economy was contracting during its longest and deepest postwar recessions. Economists have commented that consumers are likely to delay spending on big items while economic uncertainty reigns following the Brexit decision. Meanwhile the yen hit more than a two-week low against the dollar as investors factored in more monetary stimulus following the the election victory by Japan\u2019s ruling coalition. The dollar rose 0.8% to 103.64 yen, its strongest since 24 June when the Brexit vote was revealed. The pound is rising this morning, currently up 1% against the dollar at $1.3130. As it stands, the pound is on track for its biggest one-day gain since before the EU referendum. Sterling is also up 0.6% against the euro at \u20ac1.1813. Markets have edged higher in early trading, following the FTSE 100\u2019s move into a bull market on Monday. The FTSE 100 is trailing however, down four points. Investors have found comfort from the sooner-than-expected end to the Conservative Party leadership contest. Theresa May\u2019s confirmation as the next Prime Minister removes the uncertainty that investors were expecting to run for another couple of month. May is expected to move into Number 10 on Wednesday, when firm plans for Brexit and life outside the EU can get underway.

There will be no repeat of the credit crunch of 2008/2009.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Consumers are also in a better position than they were before the crisis, with fewer debts.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The Bank of England did not intervene in America\u2019s response to the HSBC files.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has agreed to hand notes of private meetings he had with the chancellor in the run-up to the EU referendum to MPs, after a Treasury select committee hearing where the governor of the Bank of England faced questions about whether he had \u201cpeddled phoney forecasts\u201d about the risks of a vote for Brexit. In his first appearance at the Treasury select committee since the referendum, the Bank\u2019s governor faced questions about whether he had tried to scare the electorate by warning of the economic shock \u2013 and possible recession \u2013 that a vote to leave the EU would cause. Andrew Tyrie, the committee\u2019s chairman, citing two former chancellors and two former leaders of the Conservative party, said the Bank had also been accused of \u201cstartling dishonesty\u201d. Tyrie, a Conservative MP, told Carney that the accusations, if true, would be a \u201cvery robust assault on the Bank\u2019s credibility\u201d and also of the independence from government it was granted in 1997 that could not be recovered under the Canadian\u2019s tenure. Carney said he had held private meetings with George Osborne before the 23 June vote. He agreed that the MPs could appoint someone to review the notes of those meetings but said he would be reluctant for them to be made public. Carney was also asked by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent Brexit campaigner, whether the Bank should be, like Caesar\u2019s wife, beyond suspicion in terms of being influenced by politicians. The governor, who said politicians had sought to inform him rather than influence him, replied: \u201cThose who cast it [the independence] into question should consider their motivations and their judgments.\u201d Carney, who was asked by Tyrie whether he had been swaying policymakers inside the Bank to adopt the view of George Osborne who campaigned to remain, said: \u201cWe have an obligation to give these assessments. \u201cIf we view something as the biggest risk to financial stability, we have an obligation to parliament and to the people of the UK to make that clear.\u201d The accusations were \u201cextraordinary\u201d said Carney. Carney was giving evidence in his capacity as chairman of the financial policy committee (FPC), which looks for risks to the financial system, rather than as chairman of the monetary policy committee (MPC) which on Thursday could move interest rates for the first time since March 2009. He is in purdah ahead of the MPC meeting this week but said in the week after the referendum result that he expected interest rates would be cut during the summer. Asked about the Bank\u2019s warnings before the 23 June vote, Carney said: \u201cThings have changed. We don\u2019t keep things under wraps. We don\u2019t look to have exchange rate crises, we look to have exchange rate adjustments.\u201d The former chancellors that Tyrie referred to are Lord Lamont, the chancellor at the time of the exchange rate mechanism crisis in 1992, and Lord Lawson. The two peers, together with ex-party leaders Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard, wrote to the Daily Telegraph during the referendum campaign to criticise the Bank and Treasury officials. Other members of the FPC also gave evidence following the publication last week of the half-yearly assessment of financial risks, which warned of the risk of a shock to commercial property prices, and also relaxed bank capital rules to make it easier for them to lend another \u00a3150bn to households and small businesses. Richard Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs banker, and Donald Kohn, a former member of the US Federal Reserve, also insisted the forecasts had not been phoney. MPs also asked about a congressional report that showed the US government decided not to pursue criminal charges against HSBC for allowing terrorists and drug dealers to launder billions of dollars after Osborne and the UK banking regulator intervened to warn that prosecuting Britain\u2019s biggest bank could lead to a \u201cglobal financial disaster\u201d. Carney said the Bank did not have discussions with US judicial authorities. But he added: \u201cCentral banking authorities, when there are serious cases of misconduct, consult with their foreign peers to discuss the financial stability implications.\u201d The governor said the move to ease bank capital rules was intended to address \u201cpotential concerns about credit supply. This is not 2007/8/9. The risk environment has shifted, we\u2019re in a situation of increased uncertainty. How long that will last is a subject of debate. During this period there may be reductions in credit demand, reductions in risk taking\u201d. But, Carney said, it was not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d and demand for credit would depend on the economy.",

      "bodyText": "Asos expects to benefit from the fall in the pound\u2019s value after the UK voted to leave the EU because sterling\u2019s slide has made its clothes cheaper for US and European customers. The online fashion retailer said that because more than half of its sales come from outside the UK it is protected against a downturn in demand from British consumers. The pound has fallen about 10% since the 23 June referendum. It has plunged to a series of 31-year lows against the dollar, with some economists expecting it to remain low as the economy slows. In the short term, the pound\u2019s fall has been good for some companies that sell goods and services abroad because it gives overseas customers more buying power. Asos covers most countries in the world and has expanded by launching websites targeted at the US, Germany and other markets. Nick Beighton, Asos\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur sales prices which are denominated off sterling now look cheaper to the US customer and look cheaper to the European customer. What we think that will give us is a greater sales trajectory.\u201d Beighton said it was too early to predict the long-term effects of Brexit but in the immediate term improved sales would more than make up for the higher cost of imported raw materials, such as cotton. The gain from post-referendum currency swings is a marked contrast with two years ago when the strong pound and lack of flexibility in Asos\u2019s pricing outside the UK forced it to slash prices and triggered profit warnings. Beighton made his comments as Asos reported better than expected trading so far this financial year. Total retail sales rose 30% to \u00a3500.5m in the four months to 30 June. Asos\u2019s first half finishes at the end of August. UK sales rose 28% and international sales increased 31% as trading accelerated in the US, the EU and other overseas markets.

But the era of glossy brochures selling holiday dreams is almost over: leading package holiday brands Thomson and First Choice are to ditch their traditional brochures by 2020, as customers demand increasingly sophisticated interactive digital experiences to help them choose and book their breaks. Millions of brochures will be phased out over the next four years. The racks of paper will be replaced with digital screens and new technology in the group\u2019s 600 UK travel agencies. The first brochure was launched in 1953 for Skytours, which later became part of Thomson and still exists as a sub-brand. Announcing the move, the group\u2019s managing director, Nick Longman, said it would undergo its planned UK rebrand \u2013 the Thomson brand is set to disappear and be replaced by the name Tui \u2013 next year. The UK and Ireland arm of the Germany-based business is the UK\u2019s largest tour operator, with more than 10,000 employees serving more than 5.5m customers every year. Longman said the decision to scrap brochures had been triggered by the change in the way holidaymakers research and book holidays: \u201cAs a leading travel company it\u2019s essential we adapt to these changes to make sure our website and retail shops stay relevant to holidaymakers. People used to visit an agency and spend hours flicking through the brochure and decide where they wanted to go. Things have moved on.\u201d Beyond the physical stores, the group will be investing in video content and technology for its online channels to bring its holidays to life and serve each customer with personalised content, with the aim of tailoring holiday offers to holidaymakers\u2019 needs and budget. It is considering introducing virtual reality headsets across its travel agency network \u2013 allowing customers to experience 360-degree virtual tours of hotels and resorts \u2013 and even technology that recognises a customer as they walk into a shop. The group, which prints 4.7m brochures a year across 58 themed titles, said it planned to publish a \u201clifestyle-related\u201d magazine but on a much smaller scale. Thomson\u2019s newest concept stores \u2013 called Holiday Design Stores \u2013 have already done away with brochure racks in favour of technology such as interactive maps and video walls. Despite the popularity of online booking, Longman insisted there was still a need for high street travel shops. \u201cWe believe there will always be customers who want the expertise, knowledge, assurance and the personal experience received in retail shops from our people. We need to give our retail advisers the tools that customers are demanding to help them continue providing excellent service and content. People still want reassurance. As a leading retailer we need to adapt and stay relevant. When we decided to get rid of the coloured \u2018deal cards\u2019 from our windows seven or eight years ago there was an outcry, but that was the right decision.\u201d Longman said the Brexit vote had so far had little impact on the company\u2019s business as it planned ahead for the long term. But with UK customers\u2019 spending money squeezed due to exchange rate volatility he expected all-inclusive holidays \u2013 which account for 60% of First Choice\u2019s business \u2013 to enjoy a surge in popularity.",

      "bodyText": "Ireland\u2019s economy expanded by more than three times the previous estimate last year, posting growth of more than 26% following a flurry of foreign investment. The Irish economy grew by 26.3% in 2015, compared with the expected rate of 7.8%, after foreign companies that switched their base to Ireland were included in the value of its corporate sector, pushing up the value of the state\u2019s balance sheet. The process of switching tax domicile after a merger or acquisition, known as an \u201cinversion\u201d, has increased in recent years, and Ireland has become a popular end destination in these corporate manoeuvres because of its low corporate tax regime. Several US companies, including drugs maker Allergan, security systems provider Tyco and medical technology specialist Medtronic have domiciled in Ireland by buying a smaller Irish-registered rival and \u201cinverting\u201d into an Irish corporate structure. A surge in aircraft imported into Ireland by leasing companies that send the jets out on loan to airlines was also among the main reasons for the economic growth. Lease operators based in Ireland account for about 20% of the global market, with sales of \u20ac7.8bn (\u00a36.6bn). Michael Connolly, a senior statistician at the Central Statistics Office, said: \u201cWhat happens here is that an entire balance sheet of a company relocating to Ireland from somewhere else is included in our capital stocks or our international investment position. \u201cThe very dramatic increase has increased the capacity for production in the economy and impacts the accounts for 2015 in the increase of exports and imports.\u201d Earlier this year, the US president, Barack Obama, called on Congress to close down inversion deals, describing them as \u201cone of the most insidious tax loopholes out there\u201d. \u201cWhen companies exploit loopholes like this, it makes it harder to invest in the things that are going to keep America\u2019s economy going strong for future generations,\u201d he said in response to a deal by drugs maker Pfizer intended to redomicile from its headquarters in New York to Ireland by purchasing Allergan, which was later abandoned.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former BHS shareholder Richard Caring has refused to reveal how much profit he made from the 2006 sale of a 22% stake in the department store group, which collapsed into administration earlier this year putting 11,000 jobs at risk. Caring\u2019s refusal to reveal the sale price for his shares came as the accountancy watchdog admitted it could take two years to complete its investigation into the failed retailer. In a letter to MPs investigating the demise of BHS, Caring said he had paid \u00a310m for the stake in 2001, but would not reveal how much he received for the shares five years later. He said he bought his stake a year after Sir Philip Green and his wife, Tina, took control of BHS in 2000 and was not involved in the initial buy-out. The multimillionaire restaurateur and high street clothing supplier, who was paid \u00a393.5m in dividends from BHS during his five years as a shareholder, said he sold his stake in 2006 to Lady Tina Green, the ultimate shareholder of BHS, and the deal did not use funds from the retailer itself, suggesting it was not relevant to MPs\u2019 enquiries. MPs are seeking to examine all the money flowing out of BHS in the 16 years before it collapsed into administration earlier this year with a pension fund deficit of \u00a3571m. Green, who sold BHS for \u00a31 in 2015, is facing widespread criticism over the extraction of more than \u00a3586m in dividends, interest on loans and rental income from BHS over the 15 years he led the business. Robin Saunders, a fellow shareholder, told MPs she received \u00a3800,000 for her 0.5% share in BHS in 2009, suggesting Caring could have received as much as \u00a333.6m for his stake. Frank Field MP, chair of the work and pensions committee, one of two parliamentary committees looking into retail chain\u2019s demise, said: \u201cRichard Caring refuses to tell us how much he was paid by Lady Green in 2006 for his secret shareholding. He tells us that this is private, and not within the scope of our inquiry. \u201cOn the contrary: understanding these mutually beneficial secret deals, understanding exactly how Sir Philip Green managed to make BHS so lucrative for his family in the early years, is crucial to understanding the mess we are in now, with 11,000 jobs and 22,000 people\u2019s full pension entitlement on the line.\u201d Caring, who has refused to attend parliament in person to give evidence, said he was not in a position to assess why BHS had failed as he was not closely involved in the business after 2006 and had only ever been involved in running its women\u2019s clothing business. \u201cAs far as women\u2019s wear is concerned, I believe that prior to 2006 all that could have been done to make BHS a success, was done.\u201d He denied offering special discounts to BHS to boost profits when he was a shareholder but revealed he had supplied \u00a320.9m worth of goods to the retailer in 2002 and was still supplying \u00a39m of clothing in 2015 when Green sold the business. As part of the enquiry, MPs wrote to the Financial Reporting Council, the accountants\u2019 watchdog, asking it to consider broadening an investigation into the conduct of accountancy firm PWC in auditing of BHS in the year to August 2014. In a letter published on Tuesday, the FRC said it would consider extending the time period it was investigating and might look into companies connected to BHS if evidence suggested it should do so. The FRC warned that it had no set deadline to conclude its investigation although it aimed to do so \u201cin about two years\u201d. \u201cWe will work for as rapid a conclusion as possible but when the outcome may culminate in highly contentious litigation we have to take great care,\u201d Stephen Haddrill, FRC chief executive, wrote to Ian Wright MP, chair of the business innovation and skills committee which is investigating BHS\u2019s demise.",

The FRC warned that it had no set deadline to conclude its investigation although it aimed to do so \u201cin about two years\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe will work for as rapid a conclusion as possible but when the outcome may culminate in highly contentious litigation we have to take great care,\u201d Stephen Haddrill, FRC chief executive, wrote to Ian Wright MP, chair of the business innovation and skills committee which is investigating BHS\u2019s demise. </p>",

Documents released by Threadneedle Street show that policymakers were told in meetings on 28 June and 1 July of the outflows from funds investing in commercial property. These funds usually offer instant access to cash but as they are invested in properties such as office blocks and warehouses, their assets are hard to sell quickly. Since 4 July, seven funds have taken steps to either stop withdrawals by suspending trading or reducing the fund\u2019s value. Aberdeen Asset Management is cutting the value of its fund by 17%, the largest reduction yet. The record of the meeting of the financial policy committee (FPC) \u2013 established to look for risks in the financial system \u2013 shows that the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), had issued a briefing on commercial property funds. \u201cThe FPC was briefed by the FCA on the extent of outflows from these funds and on the possibility that funds could suspend redemptions in the near term,\u201d the record of meetings on 28 June and 1 July shows. The record is published a week after the FPC announced a further \u00a3150bn would be freed up by banks to encourage lending and also warned that property funds could exacerbate movements on prices if they were forced to sell. The FPC is chaired by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. The Bank also released two paragraphs redacted from the last quarterly meeting in March outlining aspects of contingency planning made ahead of the 23 June referendum. As well as being ready to pump billions of pounds into the financial system, the Bank said \u201csupervisors were engaging with banks, insurers and central counterparties on their contingency plans for risks related to the referendum, including for managing funding and liquidity risks in sterling and foreign currency\u201d. \u201cSeveral firms had reported that they were conducting stress tests with referendum-related strategies of varying severity.\u201d This was not reported in March as it was deemed to be against the public interest. Following the referendum result, banking shares fell 20% and volatility in sterling against the dollar hit its highest level in postwar history, the Bank said.",

      "bodyText": "Investors are still trying to catch some of the runaway success of Pok\u00e9mon Go, extending the gain for Nintendo shares to more than 50% in three trading days since the game was launched. Nintendo\u2019s shares rose 12.8% to \u00a522,860 in Tokyo on Tuesday, taking total gains in the past three days to 53%. The rise has added \u00a37bn to the company\u2019s market value since the latest version of its 21-year-old game was made available on 7 July. Pok\u00e9mon Go is the first edition of the game \u2013 whose slogan is \u201cgotta catch \u2018em all\u201d \u2013 for mobile phones and lets players apprehend the eponymous monsters using their smartphone cameras. It has turned Nintendo from a reluctant adopter of mobile gaming to an augmented reality trailblazer that has taken gaming off the sofa and into uncharted territory. Nintendo is only indirectly involved with the game but it owns 33% of the Pok\u00e9mon company, which holds the Pok\u00e9mon franchise and develops the main series of games, and it has a stake in Niantic, the former Google subsidiary that developed Pok\u00e9mon Go. The game is free but it makes money by tempting people to buy extra Pok\u00e9Balls and other in-app features \u2013 and the signs are that it is highly compulsive. So far, Pok\u00e9mon Go is officially available only in the US, Australia and New Zealand. It immediately became the top free app in the US and was so popular on launch day that the servers briefly failed. The app has been downloaded more than 5m times on Android and has overtaken dating service Tinder for active users. It is also rapidly approaching the daily active Android users of Twitter. With servers still under strain, its introduction to the UK and other countries has been delayed. Android users have taken to \u201csideloading\u201d the game, letting them get around Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s staged rollout but criminals have already produced malware-infected versions that, once installed, give hackers access to the user\u2019s phone and information. In further evidence of the underworld capitalising on the craze, armed robbers used it to lure victims to an isolated trap in Missouri on Sunday. People in the US have also been injured chasing monsters into hazardous spots and, on Friday, a teenager found a dead body while playing the game. There was also a report of how the game led some players to a Hells Angels club. These problems, along with the fickle nature of gamers, have caused analysts to warn that the bonanza could prove short-lived. Michael Pachter, an analyst at the stockbroker Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg News: \u201cThe game requires couch potatoes to get off the couch, and the novelty will wear off when they get tired or when their phone batteries die. I give this four months at the top of the charts, then it will fade.\u201d Nintendo, whose other famous characters include Super Mario Bros, came late to mobile gaming as it sought to protect its console business. It has promised four more smartphone games by the end of March.",
