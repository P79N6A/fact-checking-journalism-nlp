      "bodyText": "One upshot of the financial crisis is that banks claim that the days of the multimillion-pound bonus paid entirely in cash have long gone. Rules introduced by the Financial Services Authority, and later enhanced by European regulators, require the most senior staff to have at least 50% of their \"variable remuneration\" \u2013 ie bonuses \u2013 paid in shares or something similar, such as bonds. Lower paid, more junior staff who are not defined as \"code staff\" are not subjected to the same rules so each bank has its own approach to dealing with the annual payouts. Barclays, for instance, is capping cash bonuses at \u00a364,000 \u2013 the rest being paid out in shares. It has set aside \u00a366m for share-based payments for performance in 2011 \u2013 some of which, assuming the bank sticks to the same rules as 2010, will need to be held for just six months before they can be sold for cash. The size of Royal Bank of Scotland's payouts is yet to be announced but, like last year, are subject to a \u00a32,000 cap on cash bonuses, with the rest paid in debt issued by the bailed out bank. Recipients of bonuses of up to \u00a325,000 can cash in the remainder as quickly as the end of June. Meanwhile staff at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which has a strong City workforce, are being paid in \"quasi-cash\" even though the US bank is issuing $1bn (\u00a3635m) of shares to pay its staff; the shares vest immediately so can instantly be turned into cash. This demonstrates that comparing pay awards across the industry is complex and comes as the government's consultation on disclosure of bankers' pay ends tomorrow. It is the follow-on from last year's Project Merlin deal, which required banks to publish, anonymously, the five highest paid staff who report to the chief executive. The threshold is poised to rise to eight but, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consultation is proposing to change the way pay is measured \u2013 Merlin required \"awards\" of pay to be disclosed while the consultation calls for the \"vested\" value of schemes announced several years ago to be published. PwC reckons the change should not be made but points out that the \"vested\" definition is more appropriate if the purpose is to try to measure pay against performance. In PwC's view: \"The vested value basis reveals the remuneration paid after the event \u2013 in effect this is shutting the door after the horse has bolted, as it does not allow identification of incentive for senior managers that may be a problem in future.\"",

    "webTitle": "Greece's hopes for quick bailout agreement dashed", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece's hopes of quickly securing a \u20ac130bn bailout looked to be dashed on Monday after a weekend of rioting and parliamentary tumult when the Papademos government pushed through a new austerity package. Eurozone finance ministers are expected to meet in Brussels on Wednesday and had been preparing to endorse the rescue programme for Greece. But in the wake of the drama in Athens, it became clear that the eurozone was not yet ready to wave through Greece's second bailout in two years. Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for monetary affairs, made plain that the Athens vote was not a clincher. It was a \"crucial step\" towards qualifying for the second \"programme\", but not the final step. It looked as though a definitive decision would be left to an EU summit on 1 March. The German parliament has to support the new bailout and will not debate it until 27 February. Eurozone finance ministers met last week, postponed a Greek decision, delivered an ultimatum to Athens on what it had to do, and called another meeting for Wednesday that had been expected to agree the bailout. But the best that Greece can now hope for is an agreement \"in principle\". The financial markets welcomed Sunday's positive vote in Greece with the FTSE 100 in London adding another 53 points, or 0.9%, to close at 5905.7, continuing the strong new year rally. The Dow Jones industrial average was also up on Wall Street, recording a gain of more than 50 points or 0.4% in morning trading. Despite the Athens vote for a further \u20ac3.3bn (\u00a32.76bn) in savings, Rehn said the Greeks still had to identify how they were going to close a \u20ac325m funding gap in the plans. And Greece's key political leaders still have to deliver a signed acceptance of the orders from the troika of the European commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund who have drafted the programme of Greek cuts. This is to ensure that Greece's political leaders cannot renege on the deal regardless of the outcome of elections expected in April. The key player here is Antonis Samaras, leader of the conservative New Democracy who is tipped to be the next prime minister. Samaras has regularly voiced criticism of the austerity policies although he voted for them on Sunday. Last week he refused to agree to further cuts in supplementary pensions, meaning that the projected savings were \u20ac325m short. On Monday he again said the agreements with the troika should be renegotiated following the elections. The commission responded that \"clear and unequivocal commitments\" were needed from Greece's leaders on the terms of the bailout deal. \"We expect to receive clear assurances from political party leaders before they embark on the political campaign for the next election,\" said Rehn's spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj Tardio. A government minister from a eurozone country sympathetic to Greece's plight complained that the eurozone was constantly shifting the goal posts in its dealings with Athens. Eurozone ministers are also unlikely to sign off on the bailout until they know the details of a debt swap agreement with Greece's private creditors aimed at halving the country's privately-held debt to \u20ac100bn. Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek finance minister, said that the debt accord has to be concluded by Friday if Greece is to meet a 20 March deadline for redeeming \u20ac14.5bn of debt. And once all the pieces of the jigsaw are in place, the IMF has to rule whether the overall plan can achieve its aim \u2013 cutting Greek debt from 160% to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020.",

A no vote would have been the final nail in the coffin for Greece which would have had to exit the eurozone and the knock on effect for the rest of the European economy, including our own, doesn't bear thinking about. Buyers lifted the FTSE on the back of the Greek news, but it was not as confidence building a rally as one would have hoped. Investors are still wary as it does not mean Greece is immune to defaulting sometime in the future and investors continue to keep a close eye on the likes of Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy. At least today there were some successful bond auctions with Italy's yield dipping which helped assist with the rally for European indices. As metal prices rose despite disappointing GDP figures from Japan, Anglo American added 70.5p to \u00a328.17 and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation was 17.5p better at 702p. Banks were also in demand, on hopes the eurozone financial crisis could be successfully resolved. Lloyds Banking Group was lifted 0.805p to 35.295p while Royal Bank of Scotland rose 0.19p to 28.1p. Outsourcing group Capita shook off a downgrade by Deutsche Bank, which cut its price target from 633p to 619p, and climbed 2p to 634.5p. Insurer RSA rose 2p to 112.2p ahead of its results at the end of February after Nomura issued a buy note, saying: We expect a positive message to be conveyed about the group's prospects, which perhaps may also include further operational improvements. Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas said recent updates from RSA's Nordic peering Sampo and Tryg as well as Intact in Canada were positive for the UK insurer: The recent releases from Nordic and Canadian peers regarding the fourth quarter gives us increased confidence that RSA can meet their [recent guidance]. But Carnival closed 49p lower at \u00a319.13 on continuing concerns about its outlook in the wake of the capsizing of its Costa Concordia liner in January. Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide jumped 8.79p to 28.54p as Vodafone, up 1.75p to 174.4p, confirmed it was considering a possible offer for the telecoms company. Finally Kenmare Resources, which operates in Mozambique, climbed another 5.4p to 58.5p on continuing talk of possible predatory interest from Rio Tinto, up 73.5p at 3845.5p.",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor is facing calls to accelerate his \u00a320bn credit easing programme after figures from the Bank of England showed a \u00a39.6bn contraction in business lending in 2011, despite the Project Merlin agreement with the banks. As no lending targets have been set for 2012 the onus is now being placed on the \u00a320bn credit easing plan disclosed by George Osborne in his autumn statement to guarantee loans to small businesses to get credit flowing into the economy. Confirming what the British Bankers' Association had conceded on Friday, the Bank of England's official assessment of Project Merlin found that lending to small businesses was \u00a374.9bn \u2013 falling short of the target agreed a year ago by \u00a31.1bn. Royal Bank of Scotland, 83%-owned by the taxpayer, is regarded as the bank which has fallen short, even though the industry beat the \u00a3190bn overall business lending target \u2013 lending \u00a3214.9bn in 2011. RBS signed up to the lending targets last year along with Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 also bailed out by the taxpayer \u2013 HSBC, Barclays and Santander. The \u00a39.6bn contraction in lending reported by the Bank of England does not directly correlate with the promises made by the Project Merlin banks but gives a picture of what happened in 2011 when credit contracted in every quarter. Matthew Fell, director for competitive markets at the CBI, said: \"There is no doubt that regulatory changes and higher wholesale funding costs have in part constrained banks' ability to lend, so we need to look at a wider range of funding models that will help better match supply and demand. That is why it's so important that the government implements the proposed credit easing scheme as soon as possible.\" A fuller explanation of how the \u00a320bn will be used to guarantee loans is expected in next month's budget. A Treasury spokesman said the aim was get the funds \"out of the door in the first quarter of 2012\". Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, also highlighted the credit easing plan. She said: \"So far progress on credit easing has been slow. ... the scheme was supposed to be up and running by early 2012, there is no sign of it yet. Apparently the process has been held up by disputes over how to ensure that banks pass on the lower borrowing costs and how much they should pay for the scheme.\" Downing Street stressed it would take \"some time for things to return to normal\" after the financial crisis that had \"a significant effect on the banking sector and the flow of credit, not just in this country but around the world\". Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat peer who resigned as his party's spokesman in the upper house over Project Merlin, said Downing Street could not claim success: \"The banks have sucked \u00a39.6bn out of the economy. This is a stab in the back for growth and jobs.\" While RBS is adamant that it has met its targets under Project Merlin, the bank is referring to a lower \"stretch\" target of lending \u00a368.8bn to small businesses rather than the so-called \"capacity\" target of \u00a376bn. Last week Stephen Hester, chief executive of RBS, argued that the bank was lending more than its rivals combined. \"Our lending will not be far short of all the other banks combined. There is no bank in this country coming close to punching above their weight in the way we are. Forget Project Merlin and how it's defined \u2013 that's damn impressive. People have lost sight of that, they really have,\" Hester said. RBS, which has a market share of SME lending of about 28%, argues that it was responsible for nearly half of all the loans to small businesses in 2011 \u2013 and that the bank had lent more than two and half times the amount lent by its nearest rival, Lloyds Banking Group.",

      "bodyText": "The government has launched a Whitehall review of bonus structures in public sector organisations in order to ensure the rules are fit for purpose and command public confidence. Amid anger over proposed bonus payouts at companies such as Royal Bank of Scotland, the Treasury chief secretary, Danny Alexander, and the Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, have written to all government departments asking them to examine the reward structures at organisations over which they have control and prevent \"rewards for failure\". Plans to review the rules come as the chancellor, George Osborne, prepares to give the go-ahead for RBS \u2013 which is 82% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 to pay bonuses totalling more than \u00a3500\u2009m to its bankers later this month. Although the RBS chief executive, Stephen Hester, has voluntarily waived his \u00a3963,000 bonus, other senior bankers will receive multimillion-pound share handouts. However, ministers are keen to restrict the payment of bonuses in other organisations with some elements of public ownership. Earlier this month, days after the controversy around Hester's proposed bonus erupted, the government faced embarrassment after it emerged that the state-backed company Network Rail was planning to pay large performance bonuses to executives. Following intense pressure, the head of Network Rail, Sir David Higgins, subsequently announced that he and five fellow senior managers would not be seeking a payout this year. Alexander told the Daily Telegraph the review would ensure that there was no suggestion of rewards for failure in publicly funded bodies. \"The idea is to look at the levers government has to make sure that the remuneration rules are fit for purpose and command public confidence,\" he said. \"This is not about getting rid of performance pay. It is about making sure that performance pay is there for genuine excellence and not just run-of-the-mill performance.\" Organisations such as Channel Four, Royal Mail and the Met Office are expected to be included in the review. A letter sent to government departments last week said: \"The departments will need to apply their own judgment on which bodies to include in the audit but, where in doubt, will need to include bodies that are likely to attract public comment.\"",
