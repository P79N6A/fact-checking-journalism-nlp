      "bodyText": "The expected rise in US interest rates will increase financial pressures on developing countries already struggling with a 60% jump in their debt repayments since 2014, a leading charity has warned. The Jubilee Debt Campaign said a study of 126 developing nations showed that they were devoting more than 10% of their revenues on average to paying the interest on money borrowed \u2013 the highest level since before the G7 agreement to write off the debts of the world\u2019s poorest nations at Gleneagles, Scotland, in 2005. Five of the countries on the charity\u2019s list \u2013 Angola, Lebanon, Ghana, Chad and Bhutan \u2013 were spending more than a third of government revenues on servicing debts. Developing country debt moved down the international agenda following the Gleneagles agreement in which the G7 industrial countries agreed to spend \u00a330bn writing off the debts owed to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank by the 18 poor countries. But developing country debt is now once again being closely monitored by the IMF, which says 30 of the 67 poor countries it assesses are in debt distress or at risk of being so. Lending to developing countries almost doubled between 2008 and 2014 as low interest rates in the west led to a search for higher-yielding investments. A boom in commodity prices meant many poor countries borrowed in anticipation of tax receipts that have not materialised. But the Jubilee Debt Campaign said the boom\u2013bust in commodity prices was only one factor behind rising debt, pointing out that some countries were paying back money owed by former dictators, while others had been struggling with high debts for many years but had not been eligible for help. The campaign said developing countries were also vulnerable to a rise in global interest rates as central banks withdrew the support they have been providing since 2008. The US Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this week \u2013 with the financial markets expecting two or three further upward moves during 2018. Tim Jones, an economist at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: \u201cDebt payments for many countries have risen rapidly as a result of a lending boom and fall in commodity prices. The situation may worsen further as US dollar interest rates rise, and as other central banks reduce monetary stimulus. Debt payments are reducing government budgets when more spending is needed to meet the sustainable development goals.\u201d External loans to developing country governments rose from $200bn per year in 2008 to $390bn in 2014 and while they have since dropped to $300-350bn per year from 2015-2017 they remained well above levels seen prior to the global financial crisis. Commodity prices peaked in the middle of 2014 and more than halved over the next 18 months. Despite a recovery from their low in January 2016 they remain more than 40% lower than they were at their peak. The Jubilee Debt Campaign said the fall in global commodity prices had reduced the income of many governments that are reliant on commodity exports for earnings. In addition, weaker commodity prices led to the exchange rates of developing countries falling against the US dollar, increasing the relative size of debt payments since external debts tend to be owed in dollars. Angola and Mozambique \u2013 two sub-Saharan African countries heavily dependent on commodity exports \u2013 had both seen falls of 50% in their exchange rates since 2014. Jones said there had been a lack of transparency about how debts had been incurred. And he said private lenders should suffer from any restructuring agreements. \u201cWhere there are debt crises, the risk is that the IMF will bail out reckless lenders, and the debt will remain with the country concerned,\u201d Jones said. \u201cInstead, reckless lenders need to be made to bear some of the costs of economic shocks through lower debt payments, allowing governments to maintain spending on essential services.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Much to the delight of Hollywood, Donald Trump wants to open a new front in his trade offensive by punishing China for theft of America\u2019s intellectual property rights. The US entertainment industry is not awfully keen on Trump, having strongly backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, but is even less keen on its movies and TV shows being ripped off by the world\u2019s most populous country. The Motion Picture Association of America estimates that 90% of the viewings of its output in China are illegal, and that the Chinese are particularly partial to ripping off Game of Thrones, which for the past six years has been the most pirated TV show on the internet. The MPAA is urging Washington to get tough with China over intellectual property and Trump \u2013 who sees trade not as a win\u2013win exercise but more akin to the bloody dynastic struggles in Game of Thrones \u2013 appears ready to do so. The signals coming out of the White House are pretty unambiguous. Having campaigned as a protectionist, Trump intends to govern as one. He thinks \u201ctrade wars are good and easy to win\u201d and that the spoils go to those who negotiate hardest. Those who thought the president was all talk and would eventually be reined in by the \u201cgrown-ups\u201d who favoured free trade have been proved wrong. The grown-ups have either departed or been sidelined, with Trump surrounding himself with people who are more sympathetic to his America First agenda. The opening salvos in what could soon become a full-scale trade war were fired a few weeks ago when Trump announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. All things considered, the response from other leading trading nations was restrained. There was no knee-jerk retaliation from China or the EU: rather a willingness to let the World Trade Organisation in Geneva decide whether Trump\u2019s action could be justified on his purported national security grounds. But the White House has got the taste for protectionism and wants to go further. The next round of sanctions will specifically target China. After that it looks like being Europe\u2019s turn. Trump\u2019s beef with China goes beyond piracy of Hollywood movies. The administration says Beijing has forced American companies to transfer their technology across the Pacific as the price of doing business. Technology transfer is one of the ways in which developing countries close the gap with the west, but rich countries tend to guard their patents jealously. Peter Navarro, the president\u2019s director of trade and manufacturing \u2013 and an arch-protectionist \u2013 says the US is being abused by China. Trump agrees and has already said he is looking for big damages. China has until now sought to portray itself as the champion of free trade, even to the point where Xi Jinping went to Davos last year and described protectionism (by which he meant Trump\u2019s protectionism) as \u201clocking oneself in a dark room\u201d. But Beijing has said appeasement would not be an option were the US to announce more tariffs. As for the EU, it ran a $92bn trade surplus with the US in 2016. Both the EU and the US impose tariffs on each other\u2019s goods, but the EU\u2019s are higher on average. Measured in dollars, Germany is running an even bigger trade surplus than China and has been criticised for it by the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and even the European commission. The European Central Bank is not helping matters. As Albert Edwards, of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, has pointed out, the ECB\u2019s stimulus programme has involved printing euros through its quantitative easing programme. This has had the effect of weakening the value of the euro and so making exports cheaper, because both official and market interest rates are well below where they would otherwise be. The US has been threatening action against China for manipulating its currency for years. Trump may well accuse the EU of the same offence in the belief that he can force the Europeans to make life easier for American exporters. He is not the only protectionist out there. Between them, the world\u2019s 60 largest economies have imposed 7,000 new protectionist measures since the financial crisis of a decade ago, with Washington and Brussels each responsible for 1,000 of the new restrictions. The US president is at least honest about being a mercantilist; others tend to keep quiet about their protectionist proclivities. Trump sees trade negotiations as like one of his business deals: the aim is to get the other side to make concessions. He may be right in his assumption that other countries will blink first. America is, by global standards, a relatively self-contained economy: trade is 28% of GDP. That compares with 41% in China and 51% in Germany, leaving them in a much more exposed position. Predictably enough, Trump\u2019s hard line on trade has prompted calls for the US to act through multilateral organisations, such as the OECD and the WTO. But, having been instrumental in creating the WTO in the early 1990s, Washington has turned its back on the Geneva-based institution in favour of a go-it-alone approach. This is very much in accord with the spirit of the times. Belief in globalisation has been shattered by the events of the past decade. Voters, not just in the US but across the developed world, have been turning to politicians who say that the answer to flatlining living standards is for the nation state to take back powers from remote international bureaucracies. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, is right when she says the lesson of the 1930s is that trade wars are unwinnable, but Trump is not listening. Winter is coming.",

Last September, he needed to fill three positions at his central London restaurant, Gauthier Soho: a pastry chef; a chef de partie, to head up one of the stations in the kitchen; and a sommelier. Gauthier has held a Michelin star since 2011, but that is not enough of an enticement in an age where new restaurants seem to open every hour and there are not enough trained chefs and waiters to go round. Gauthier, a 44-year-old from Provence, decided to sweeten the deal: the winning candidates would each receive a \u00a31,000 \u201cgolden handshake\u201d in return for committing to work for one year. The unusual offer received some industry press and Gauthier, who has worked in London for 20 years, was pleased with the response. There were some strong applicants and all the spots were taken up within two weeks. Six months on, I check in with Gauthier: how are they getting on? \u201cAll three did not last,\u201d he sighs. \u201cOne left after a week. The other two left after two and three months.\u201d Each had their reasons: one chef went home to France, the other returned to Italy and the sommelier decided to go back to studying oenology. Gauthier doesn\u2019t take the rejection personally and prides himself on being a fair boss. \u201cI used to be an employee for many years myself, so the day I became an employer I did not want to be a bastard,\u201d he says. Gauthier pays his staff comparatively well: they also receive a private pension, health insurance and each has access to a research and development fund, for trying out other restaurants and bakeries, that pays out between \u00a3250 and \u00a31,000 a month per person, depending on experience. One p\u00e2tissier and sommelier saved up their stipends and went to eat at Eleven Madison Avenue in New York. Gauthier says: \u201cWe try to make sure they can develop their professional career with our help.\u201d That, however, does not seem to be enough in 2018. In one way, Gauthier concedes that he is lucky: he is first and foremost a chef, so if he is one or two down in the kitchen \u2013 which is the case most days \u2013 he can fill in. Gauthier Soho does around 100 covers a day (50 for lunch, 50 for dinner) and, if really stretched, he can remove one dish from the menu and the quality of the service is not compromised. \u201cAs an employer, as a businessman, the sun is shining,\u201d he says wryly. \u201cI can work the extra hours and it\u2019s more money in a way for me! But it\u2019s unsustainable.\u201d Gauthier is out of ideas about what to do next. \u201cI swear,\u201d he huffs, \u201cif I\u2019d given a \u00a310,000 bonus, it would still be the same.\u201d This is, most agree, a golden age for eating out in Britain: never before has such a high quality of food been so widely available. This boom, though, is threatened by a chronic shortage of chefs and waiting staff. The hospitality industry is responsible for six million jobs, making it the UK\u2019s fourth biggest employer. But this notoriously precarious business appears to be more topsy-turvy than ever. For every heartening headline: \u201cRecord 44 new restaurants set to open across London in September,\u201d from the Evening Standard in September, 2017; there\u2019s a depressing one: \u201cNumber of UK restaurants going bust up by a fifth in 2017\u201d from the Guardian last month. The situation, post-Brexit, will only become more complicated. The British Hospitality Association, with help from accountancy firm KPMG, published a report last year which suggests that the sector is staring into a recruitment black hole without EU nationals to bail them out: by 2029, the industry could have a deficit of more than a million workers. The report recommended that the industry will need to find at least another 60,000 workers per year on top of the 200,000 required \u201cto replace churn and to power growth\u201d. Of course, 2029 is a way off, but the pinch is being felt now, according to Adam Hyman from Code Hospitality, a consultancy on restaurants and recruitment. \u201cEvery single restaurant in London is constantly looking for people \u2013 and good people.\u201d He tells of a London private members\u2019 club whose head of recruitment went out to Australia last year to find chefs. Although the problem is perhaps being felt most keenly in London \u2013 where KPMG found that 25% of chefs and 75% of the waiting staff were from continental Europe \u2013 it is a nationwide concern, one that predates Brexit. Josh Overington took over Le Cochon Aveugle in York four years ago and won over diners and critics with his thoughtful take on classic French cooking. Yet, ever since opening, the 30-year-old Overington \u2013 who represented the north-east in 2017\u2019s Great British Menu \u2013 cannot recall more than a week here or there when Le Cochon Aveugle has been fully staffed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a constant struggle to find chefs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a very small restaurant, we can fit four chefs in at one time, and the chef de partie\u201d \u2013 number three in the chain of command \u2013 \u201chas, in particular, been an elusive position. We\u2019ve had long periods where it\u2019s not filled, and it\u2019s still not filled even as we speak.\u201d As for the causes of the chef shortage, he says there are a number of factors. \u201cA lot of it is young chefs don\u2019t have any patience. They just want to go straight to sous chef, head chef. Or they can sign up for an agency or work in a private home and the pay is better, the hours are better, you\u2019re not being shouted at. You don\u2019t really have any responsibilities and life is a lot better.\u201d Agency chefs are becoming a controversial \u2013 but indispensable \u2013 part of the restaurant food chain, filling in the holes when they arise. A recent report on the Big Hospitality website asked whether these freelance individuals were \u201cKitchen heroes or mercenary zeroes?\u201d It\u2019s easy to see why chefs are attracted to agencies: with wages often up to 25% higher than for equivalent staffers. Overington, though, has vowed to never use them again: \u201cThey\u2019re not good enough. I\u2019m basically paying double for a member of staff who isn\u2019t anywhere near the level they need to be to work in a kitchen.\u201d Overington believes many restaurants will start offering simpler food and concentrate more on quality produce. This is fine, he says, but will make it harder than ever to operate \u201ca game-changing\u201d kitchen: \u201cNo one\u2019s going to have the money; no one\u2019s going to have the time.\u201d He has maintained standards at Le Cochon Aveugle by working long hours himself but, like Gauthier, he knows this is a short-term fix. On honeymoon in Australia in January, Overington marvelled at how different the restaurant culture was: chefs were rested, fresh, rarely working more than 10 hours a day. \u201cI had a long, hard think: \u2018Do I really want to carry on doing it?\u2019\u201d Overington admits. \u201cEvery day coming into work short staffed and customers\u2019 expectations are so high because they\u2019re spending quite a lot of money. And you go, \u2018God, how do I get by?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a similar story elsewhere. Dan Smith, who won best young chef at the 2016 OFM Awards when he was a sous chef at the Clove Club, set up on his own at the Fordwich Arms in Kent in December. \u201cStaffing has been the toughest part of it,\u201d he says. For the first month, Smith ran the kitchen with just the help of his fianc\u00e9e Tash: \u201cWe were doing 25 to 30 covers for lunch, 40 covers for dinner. It was good fun for a little bit, but you can\u2019t go on like that; you\u2019d burn out.\u201d Smith, who is 26, spent three years earning a professional chef\u2019s diploma from Westminster Kingsway College, working in restaurants at night. He\u2019s young, but he has a decade\u2019s experience, and this background and commitment is increasingly rare: \u201cIf I put an ad for a chef up, the people that are applying are plumbers, labourers, with no kitchen experience. You see that more and more: there\u2019s fewer chefs coming through and I\u2019m sure the catering colleges will tell you the same.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a seller\u2019s market: if you have the skills, you can pick and choose where you work. Serena von der Heyde, the owner of the five-star Georgian House Hotel in Victoria, London, has found it almost impossible to recruit chefs. \u201cIt\u2019s a desperate situation,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we put an ad in, we don\u2019t get people responding. Or they don\u2019t turn up for interview. Or they don\u2019t turn up for their first day. It used to be that we were interviewing someone for the role. Now we\u2019re trying to sell the role to them!\u201d Von der Heyde has attempted to enter partnerships with schools and colleges, and with charities that connect businesses with ex-offenders and women returning to work after a period of crisis. \u201cRecruiting people from these different sources takes 10 times as long and has a tenth of the success rate,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people coming through that aren\u2019t really ready to go into work, don\u2019t have the self-confidence, so we try very hard with all of that.\u201d So, why don\u2019t young people want to be chefs and waiting staff any more? Anthony Bourdain styled chefs as renegades, Jamie Oliver showed the job could be lucrative and had the potential to change society, Gordon Ramsay lost his rag a lot \u2013 but, the more we looked into professional kitchens, the more it became clear that for many employees working in a restaurant meant antisocial hours, low pay and attritional conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy to be cleaning a kitchen at 11pm,\u201d says Gauthier. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy to come in at 8.30am to clean the inside of a fish or debone a rack of lamb.\u201d He exhales, \u201cFor a lot of people it would be hell. For me, it\u2019s beautiful. But if you don\u2019t have the passion, you can\u2019t force yourself into it. And the passion comes from perseverance [but], in a society where the majority of people want things fast, it goes against the idea of perseverance.\u201d In recent years, too, young people interested in food didn\u2019t have to follow the traditional route of earning their stripes in a kitchen. For a couple of years, everyone was launching food trucks or supper clubs: you got to be your own boss and maybe you\u2019d be the next Pitt Cue or the new Bao. But those successes are becoming rarer. \u201cThis is a mirage,\u201d scoffs Gauthier. \u201cA lot of people have been excited to be an entrepreneur but you tell me the number who have succeeded? I can\u2019t think of five. And there are probably 50,000 who have tried.\u201d Meanwhile, the murky reputation of the professional kitchen appears to be catching up with it. \u201cAnother reason why there\u2019s no chefs is because they get bullied, they work long hours, getting paid little money for that,\u201d says Overington from Le Cochon Aveugle. \u201cI\u2019m not saying everywhere is horrendous, because it\u2019s not, but I\u2019m sure nearly 100% of chefs my age would have had horrendous experiences.\u201d For consultant Adam Hyman, it all comes back to an eternal failure in Britain \u2013 in contrast to, say, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 to promote working in a restaurant as \u201cjust as respectable as being an accountant, a lawyer or a teacher\u201d. He continues, \u201cHospitality has never been seen as a proper career in Britain. It\u2019s been seen as something that you do on your summer holidays or in between proper jobs. And that\u2019s now starting to catch up.\u201d There are few obvious solutions to the chef shortage. Gauthier would like to see an overhaul of the apprentice system, perhaps to bring it in line with France, where each area has a state-funded catering school that provides staff for the local restaurants. \u201cWe need to start from scratch, by having people who are 14, 15, 16 going into the apprenticeships: they work one week in the restaurant, one week in school,\u201d says Gauthier. \u201cThe school is funded by the government for chefs and for waiters and they graduate with a serious diploma that everybody is proud of holding.\u201d Some of the bigger restaurant groups are taking matters into their own hands. Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, for example, has partnered with the University of West London to offer a three-year programme and certification up to NVQ Level 3 in professional cookery, patisserie and confectionery. So far 36 students have entered the scheme, 10 have graduated \u2013 in all catering courses, a high drop-out rate is expected \u2013 and a new intake for September will be selected this spring. Overington, meanwhile, is attempting to improve the quality of life for his staff. He recently announced that, from this summer, his restaurant will open for only four nights a week. \u201cSince doing that, I\u2019ve actually had more interest from potential candidates than ever before,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich I\u2019m actually really surprised at; I didn\u2019t think it would make that big a difference. Obviously, it\u2019s a massive risk to go down to four days for a little business like us, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re willing to do for our life-work balance.\u201d Von der Heyde believes that the situation will become impossible if the government pushes forward with the plan to restrict the number of EU nationals allowed visas to work in the UK. \u201cHowever much we want to think there\u2019s a pool of British workers who are being undercut by foreign workers,\u201d she says, \u201cin London, in my patch, in my industry, it is simply not the case.\u201d She issues a stark warning. \u201cTwenty years ago, London had an awful reputation for its food and accommodation. Across the capital, you\u2019ve seen standards rise. But the pressure that we\u2019re under, it\u2019s pushing us backwards. It\u2019s going to push us to be the capital of budget service in the world.\u201d Numbers may be down, times are definitely hard, but everyone you speak to still has genuine passion for what they do. No one proves that better than the Fordwich Arms\u2019s Smith. \u201cI could never imagine being sat in front of a computer all day,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing a chef is so creative. You have the freedom to say, \u2018what can we get today from the market?\u2019 Or, \u2018what\u2019s the fisherman caught today?\u2019 There\u2019s very few industries that you can create things every day. Once people realise that, that\u2019s the thing that will give them the drive to want to do it.\u201d",

It was good fun for a little bit, but you can\u2019t go on like that; you\u2019d burn out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith, who is 26, spent three years earning a professional chef\u2019s diploma from Westminster Kingsway College, working in restaurants at night. He\u2019s young, but he has a decade\u2019s experience, and this background and commitment is increasingly rare: \u201cIf I put an ad for a chef up, the people that are applying are plumbers, labourers, with no kitchen experience. You see that more and more: there\u2019s fewer chefs coming through and I\u2019m sure the catering colleges will tell you the same.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e77805d19d8df764dc9c212c659404d27d197342\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e77805d19d8df764dc9c212c659404d27d197342/4_246_1973_2466/800.jpg\" alt=\"Serena von der Heyde owner of the Georgian House Hotel\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hotelier Serena von der Heyde.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Eastham</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s certainly a seller\u2019s market: if you have the skills, you can pick and choose where you work. Serena von der Heyde, the owner of the five-star <a href=\"http://georgianhousehotel.co.uk/heritage/\">Georgian House Hotel</a> in Victoria, London, has found it almost impossible to recruit chefs. \u201cIt\u2019s a desperate situation,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we put an ad in, we don\u2019t get people responding. Or they don\u2019t turn up for interview. Or they don\u2019t turn up for their first day. It used to be that we were interviewing someone for the role. Now we\u2019re trying to sell the role to them!\u201d</p> \n<p>Von der Heyde has attempted to enter partnerships with schools and colleges, and with charities that connect businesses with ex-offenders and women returning to work after a period of crisis. \u201cRecruiting people from these different sources takes 10 times as long and has a tenth of the success rate,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people coming through that aren\u2019t really ready to go into work, don\u2019t have the self-confidence, so we try very hard with all of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>So, why don\u2019t young people want to be chefs and waiting staff any more? Anthony Bourdain styled chefs as renegades, Jamie Oliver showed the job could be lucrative and had the potential to change society, Gordon Ramsay lost his rag a lot \u2013 but, the more we looked into professional kitchens, the more it became clear that for many employees working in a restaurant meant antisocial hours, low pay and attritional conditions.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not sexy to be cleaning a kitchen at 11pm,\u201d says Gauthier. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy to come in at 8.30am to clean the inside of a fish or debone a rack of lamb.\u201d He exhales, \u201cFor a lot of people it would be hell. For me, it\u2019s beautiful. But if you don\u2019t have the passion, you can\u2019t force yourself into it. And the passion comes from perseverance [but], in a society where the majority of people want things fast, it goes against the idea of perseverance.\u201d</p> \n<p>In recent years, too, young people interested in food didn\u2019t have to follow the traditional route of earning their stripes in a kitchen. For a couple of years, everyone was launching food trucks or supper clubs: you got to be your own boss and maybe you\u2019d be the next Pitt Cue or the new Bao. But those successes are becoming rarer. \u201cThis is a mirage,\u201d scoffs Gauthier. \u201cA lot of people have been excited to be an entrepreneur but you tell me the number who have succeeded? I can\u2019t think of five. And there are probably 50,000 who have tried.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the murky reputation of the professional kitchen appears to be catching up with it. \u201cAnother reason why there\u2019s no chefs is because they get bullied, they work long hours, getting paid little money for that,\u201d says Overington from Le Cochon Aveugle. \u201cI\u2019m not saying everywhere is horrendous, because it\u2019s not, but I\u2019m sure nearly 100% of chefs my age would have had horrendous experiences.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/26/chefs-mental-health-depression\">Is being a chef bad for your mental health?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For consultant Adam Hyman, it all comes back to an eternal failure in Britain \u2013 in contrast to, say, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 to promote working in a restaurant as \u201cjust as respectable as being an accountant, a lawyer or a teacher\u201d. He continues, \u201cHospitality has never been seen as a proper career in Britain. It\u2019s been seen as something that you do on your summer holidays or in between proper jobs. And that\u2019s now starting to catch up.\u201d There are few obvious solutions to the chef shortage. Gauthier would like to see an overhaul of the apprentice system, perhaps to bring it in line with France, where each area has a state-funded catering school that provides staff for the local restaurants.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to start from scratch, by having people who are 14, 15, 16 going into the apprenticeships: they work one week in the restaurant, one week in school,\u201d says Gauthier. \u201cThe school is funded by the government for chefs and for waiters and they graduate with a serious diploma that everybody is proud of holding.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some of the bigger restaurant groups are taking matters into their own hands. Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, for example, has partnered with the University of West London <a href=\"https://www.uwl.ac.uk/course/chefs-apprenticeship/33362\">to offer a three-year programme</a> and certification up to NVQ Level 3 in professional cookery, patisserie and confectionery. So far 36 students have entered the scheme, 10 have graduated \u2013 in all catering courses, a high drop-out rate is expected \u2013 and a new intake for September will be selected this spring.</p> \n<p>Overington, meanwhile, is attempting to improve the quality of life for his staff. He recently announced that, from this summer, his restaurant will open for only four nights a week. \u201cSince doing that, I\u2019ve actually had more interest from potential candidates than ever before,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich I\u2019m actually really surprised at; I didn\u2019t think it would make that big a difference. Obviously, it\u2019s a massive risk to go down to four days for a little business like us, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re willing to do for our life-work balance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Von der Heyde believes that the situation will become impossible if the government pushes forward with the plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/31/theresa-may-brexit-transition-no-deal-for-eu-citizens-coming-to-uk\">restrict the number of EU nationals </a>allowed visas to work in the UK. \u201cHowever much we want to think there\u2019s a pool of British workers who are being undercut by foreign workers,\u201d she says, \u201cin London, in my patch, in my industry, it is simply not the case.\u201d</p> \n<p>She issues a stark warning. \u201cTwenty years ago, London had an awful reputation for its food and accommodation. Across the capital, you\u2019ve seen standards rise. But the pressure that we\u2019re under, it\u2019s pushing us backwards. It\u2019s going to push us to be the capital of budget service in the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>Numbers may be down, times are definitely hard, but everyone you speak to still has genuine passion for what they do. No one proves that better than the Fordwich Arms\u2019s Smith. \u201cI could never imagine being sat in front of a computer all day,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing a chef is so creative. You have the freedom to say, \u2018what can we get today from the market?\u2019 Or, \u2018what\u2019s the fisherman caught today?\u2019 There\u2019s very few industries that you can create things every day. Once people realise that, that\u2019s the thing that will give them the drive to want to do it.\u201d</p>",

We may revere Franco Baresi\u2019s peerless defending during his years at AC Milan, the wonder goals of Southampton\u2019s Matt Le Tissier and the, er, sensational dribbles of Liverpool\u2019s Jamie Carragher, but for every one of those examples there are scores of contemporaries who dot around the league taking whichever contract their agents fancy. It is the same in the City, where the notion that a chief exec might spend a career plying his trade for a single outfit feels rarer still. Yet such people do exist. Just about. Take this week, for example, when the retail trade is on show. Amid the inevitable questions about how the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d has affected trading, there might be some longer-term questions posed to the two shopping stalwarts pencilled in for a run-out. Simon Wolfson came through the youth team at the family firm \u2013 the retailer Next \u2013 becoming chief executive at 33. That was back in 2001, so he\u2019s now been there long enough to hire shop assistants who had yet to be born when he first got the gig. We also have a scheduled update from fashion chain Ted Baker, where founder Ray Kelvin has long passed Wolfson\u2019s landmark \u2013 having created his firm in 1987 and floated it on the stock exchange in 1997. Each, of course, has a very different style of play, yet they also have more in common than their longevity. What ties them together is that both have managed to steer their companies through the constant challenges in their sector, only suffering the odd problematic season that seem to afflict their rivals more frequently. These achievements come despite each retailer having scores of physical stores in an era when the future of the high street is constantly thought to be under threat from the rise of online shopping. Wolfson has even been opening new outlets \u2013 albeit on increasingly flexible leases \u2013 and starting to do eyebrow-arching deals with the space he has, including an agreement with car dealer Rockar that, oddly, gives Manchester punters the chance to shop for cheap suits and a new motor at the same time. Meanwhile, Kelvin has hinted he might shut a few Ted Baker shops. Then again, he says, he might not. All of which rather suggests that even this pair are not totally sure what the future of the high street looks like. The uncertainty leaves shareholders wondering if they might, therefore, compare these business one-club men to Le Tissier \u2013 from whom football fans used to tolerate 89 minutes of almost total inactivity in exchange for a screamer that saved the day at the death. For now, though, that is probably too pessimistic an assessment. Wolfson\u2019s record of making the job of running a mid-market retailer look simple next to his perspiring rivals perhaps makes him more of a Baresi. The Italian, when swapping shirts at the end of a tough fixture, nonchalantly used to hand over a jersey smelling solely of his cologne. Meanwhile Kelvin \u2013 who, bizarrely, always avoids having his full visage photographed \u2013 suddenly seems to have more in common with Carragher, who is currently suspended from broadcasting duties after spitting on a teenage girl.
