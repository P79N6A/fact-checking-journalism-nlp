      "bodyText": "The weakest level of property sales in four years is pushing down house prices in all regions of the UK outside London, says the body representing estate agents. The monthly snapshot of the property market from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors found that home transactions in July dropped for a fourth month and the balance of surveyors reporting falling prices was at its highest level for a year. RICS said its members expected prices to continue edging downwards over the coming months even though they are hopeful that the number of sales will increase in the second half of 2012. Asked about the trend in prices over the past month, a balance of -24 percentage points of agents said they were falling. The figure in June was -22 points. RICS found that most surveyors reporting price falls said they were down by less than 2%, but said there was a distinct north-south divide with London prices rising and downward pressure weakest in the south-east.

In his latest outburst, he may have surpassed himself, describing the political atmosphere in relation to banking regulation as reminiscent of the Soviet Union and protesting that the United States is a \"free fucking country\". In an interview with New York magazine, Dimon, who famously described the bank's trading problems in London as a \"tempest in a teapot\" before the full extent of the losses became clear, said he now thinks that comment was \"stupid\". But in the article \u2013 his first in-depth interview since the bank's $5.8bn trading loss emerged \u2013 he makes a new set of strongly-worded remarks and characterises himself as an \"outspoken defender of the truth\". \"Everyone is afraid of retaliation and retribution,\" he said. \"We recently had an event with a hundred small bankers here, and 85% of them said they can't challenge the regulation because of the potential retribution. That's a terrible thing. Okay? This is not the Soviet Union. This is the United States of America. That's what I remember.\" The magazine reports that his voice rises to a near shout, when he says: \"Guess what. It's a free. Fucking. Country.\" JP Morgan emerged from the credit crisis far less battle-scarred than its rivals. Before the London losses Dimon was the most respected banker on Wall Street and had used his position to push back against tighter regulation. Dimon, president and chief operating officer of JP Morgan, had initially dismissed talks of the \"London whale\" and mounting losses at the bank as a tempest in a teapot. As their true size emerged he had to backtrack. \"This was perfect for everyone who was pushing for more regulation,\" he said. \"We handed it to them on a silver platter. And then I made that stupid comment about a tempest in a teapot.\" Dimon told the magazine he had been told \"a whole bunch of stuff that made me think it was a tempest in a teapot\". When he first laid eyes on the positions built up by his London team, he said: \"There was a moment of, I can't believe what we have.\" \"I saw it all pass in front of my eyes,\" he said. \"I saw the headlines, the investigations, the uproar, the breathlessness. 'Dimon Loses Luster', 'Dimon in the Rough.' I told everyone: 'this is going to be bad, it's going to go on, and we can't get out of it. So put your jerseys on: we're going to wrestle this thing down and fix it.'\u2009\" JP Morgan fired Bruno Iskil, the trader known as the London Whale, in the wake of the scandal.

What I say is that I do love a debate, love a good row, a legal argument,\" she said.</p> <p>She is now reluctant to discuss Libor any further after telling MPs there are another seven financial firms, not all banks, under investigation. Nor she is keen to discuss the specifics of the accusations levelled against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered by a US regulator about moving $250bn (\u00a3160bn) of funds for Iranian clients</a> in breach of sanctions.</p> <p>McDermott says that new powers being handed to the regulator, which would allow the charge sheet against firms under investigation to be published, cannot be compared with the tactics used by the New York department of financial services, which gave Standard Chartered no prior warning it was going to publish allegations that the British bank had breached sanctions against Iran. If the powers \u2013 which have been criticised by the former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, Howard Flight, and others \u2013 are passed by parliament, firms would not be surprised in the same way, she argued.</p> <p>The investigation into Bank of Scotland \u2013<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/09/bank-of-scotland-fsa-serious-misconduct\" title=\"\"> a division of HBOS that has been found guilty of \"very serious misconduct\"</a> \u2013 is also continuing but she cannot talk about that either. And, on the popular question about why more bankers have not gone to jail during the five-year financial crisis, she said: \"They go to jail when they break the criminal law. It is very precise, in order to deprive them of their liability.\"</p> <p>So much of what went wrong had been about poor judgments by bankers, she said. \"I'm not sure we should want to say it should be easy to go to jail. We are committed to sending people to jail where we can. Insider dealing is the highest-profile example of that.\" Ten criminal convictions have been secured in the last 18 months and prison sentences handed out.</p> <p>McDermott moved quickly up the FSA ranks after six years with the law firm Dechert, where she was on the brink of becoming a partner. When the regulator is disbanded by the coalition next year in an attempt to beef up City regulation, her division will sit within the Financial Conduct Authority. Part of the role, as she sees it, is about restoring trust.</p> <p>\"Financial services is an incredibly important industry,\" she said. The Libor scandal closely followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/payment-protection-insurance\" title=\"\">the payment protection mis-selling saga</a> \u2013 where the compensation bill for the big banks alone is topping \u00a38bn \u2013 and interest rate swap mis-selling to small businesses.</p> <p>\"It is clearly something that matters in the public eye. This is not to say everything in the industry is bad. The overall picture is not something which makes people want to go out to their financial advisers. Firms need to be operating for the best interests of their clients and not for their own personal gain,\" she said.</p> <p>Firms and individuals come under the scrutiny of her enforcement division when they are suspected of breaking the rules. Is this a sign that regulation has failed to prevent bad behaviour in the first place?</p> <p>McDermott notes that the FSA had overhauled its approach after the 2008 crisis. Even so, she said: \"There has to be recognition that regulators will not stop every problem. This isn't just about the regulator. It's about the culture. If the only reason people's houses weren't being burgled is because of the police we'd all get burgled a lot more.\"</p>",

The investigation into Bank of Scotland \u2013 a division of HBOS that has been found guilty of \"very serious misconduct\" \u2013 is also continuing but she cannot talk about that either. And, on the popular question about why more bankers have not gone to jail during the five-year financial crisis, she said: \"They go to jail when they break the criminal law. It is very precise, in order to deprive them of their liability.\" So much of what went wrong had been about poor judgments by bankers, she said. \"I'm not sure we should want to say it should be easy to go to jail. We are committed to sending people to jail where we can. Insider dealing is the highest-profile example of that.\" Ten criminal convictions have been secured in the last 18 months and prison sentences handed out. McDermott moved quickly up the FSA ranks after six years with the law firm Dechert, where she was on the brink of becoming a partner. When the regulator is disbanded by the coalition next year in an attempt to beef up City regulation, her division will sit within the Financial Conduct Authority. Part of the role, as she sees it, is about restoring trust. \"Financial services is an incredibly important industry,\" she said. The Libor scandal closely followed the payment protection mis-selling saga \u2013 where the compensation bill for the big banks alone is topping \u00a38bn \u2013 and interest rate swap mis-selling to small businesses. \"It is clearly something that matters in the public eye. This is not to say everything in the industry is bad. The overall picture is not something which makes people want to go out to their financial advisers. Firms need to be operating for the best interests of their clients and not for their own personal gain,\" she said. Firms and individuals come under the scrutiny of her enforcement division when they are suspected of breaking the rules. Is this a sign that regulation has failed to prevent bad behaviour in the first place? McDermott notes that the FSA had overhauled its approach after the 2008 crisis. Even so, she said: \"There has to be recognition that regulators will not stop every problem. This isn't just about the regulator. It's about the culture. If the only reason people's houses weren't being burgled is because of the police we'd all get burgled a lot more.\"",

Add $275m more in severance costs (for 4,000 jobs, 20% of its workforce) and a \"significant\" extra restructuring cost by year-end and the question is, can Google ever squeeze that value out of the handsets and set-top box maker, even with the patent portfolio \u2013 17,000 awarded, 7,500 pending \u2013 that is meant to make up half its value at about $400,000 per patent? On MMI's past performance, you'd have to say no. It has lost money in 14 of the past 16 quarters. In the smartphone field only Apple and Samsung are making appreciable profits, while HTC, ZTE and Huawei scramble for the leavings. It has to fight off other loss-making Android rivals such as LG and Sony, as well as Nokia and BlackBerry-maker RIM. If there's $6bn \u2013 or $6.5bn \u2013 of future profit lurking in MMI's handset and set-top box business, it's certainly well-hidden; the handset business, when profitable, made about $80m of profit per quarter, and the set-top box business $50m. At that rate, clawing back the purchase cost would take 47 consecutive quarters, or just under 12 years. If the patents are overvalued, the payoff is even more distant. So far Google has used its Android mobile software as a defence, ensuring its broad presence in mobile search, rather than a revenue generator. But perhaps now chief executive Larry Page really thinks that MMI can become the next Samsung, or perhaps HTC, in the handset business. Doing that, though, means usurping other high-end Android handset makers. They, in turn, might defect to Microsoft's Windows Phone. And Microsoft has turned Android into a billion-dollar business for itself by wielding its own patent portfolio over Android handset companies, claiming infringement: HTC is paying about $10 per Android handset, Samsung slightly more, and dozens of others have also signed. The only holdout? MMI. Google only really bought MMI for the patent portfolio to defend Android from attacks by Apple and Microsoft after losing out in the July 2011 auction of Nortel's patents during a bankruptcy sale (won for $4.5bn by Apple, Microsoft, RIM and Sony).

An explanation from Rightmove or Williams is still forthcoming but when we asked a spokesman if he was selling out because he felt the price had peaked, the spokesman said \"certainly not\". A quick glance through the register of director dealings' does reveal though that Williams has been shedding his shareholding considerably over the last 12 months taking home (excluding bonuses he has been entitled to) an impressive \u00a318.8m. This included a \u00a36.9m share sale in April \u2013 again this was late on a Friday afternoon at 6.03pm \u2013 and another end of play sale last September when he took home \u00a33.75m. Perhaps Williams is looking for the exit, which would be surprising after Rightmove's first-half revenues rose 23% to \u00a357.9m with pre-tax profits were up by more than a third to \u00a338.9m. The results, published at the start of the month, sent shares up 10% on the day to a five year high. The company, which is used by consumers and professionals alike to hunt of property sales, boasts of being the biggest site by unique web hits in the UK. However, this statistic was called into question because Rightmove makes searchers on its site go to a secondary search page before getting their results \u2013 something the company denies. Either way, it will be interesting to see if Williams bails out completely to enjoy an early retirement or continue with the firm he has spent the last 12 years building.",

The sale is the latest move in the company's reshaping of its US business, which has taken a battering since the Deepwater Horizon disaster. It comes days after BP announced a similar sale of its two gas processing plants in Texas \u2013 Sunray and Hemphill \u2013 to Eagle Rock Energy Partners for $227.5m cash. Friday's amuse-bouche to this morning's announcement continues the company's winding down of its southern businesses and the focusing on its northern assets. It also wants to continue expansion into shale gas which will make the US a net exporter for the first time in decades. Iain Conn, chief executive of BP's global refining and marketing business, said: Today's announcement is a significant step in the strategic refocusing of our US fuels business. Together with the intended sale of Texas City, this will allow us to focus BP's operations and investments exclusively on our three northern US refineries, which are crude feedstock advantaged, and their large and important marketing businesses. BP is planning to sell off $38bn by the end of 2013 and the running total since 2010 is now at $26.5bn. And while $2.5bn seems like a lot of money to put into the pot of the London-based firm, it will pale into insignificance when the company's stake in Russian venture TNK-BP is finally sold off. The company is very, very keen to stress (twice in as many days) that its work in the US is far from over, giving the stock market a long list of its American businesses and achievements, just in case anyone thought it was starting a long retreat after its role in the biggest oil spill in history. It says (among numerous other achievements) that BP has invested more in the United States over the last five years than any other oil and gas company.

In Japan GDP was at 1.4%, nearly half the level analysts were expecting, while in Germany Angela Merkel returned from her summer hiking holiday with her husband, straight into a potential political showdown with Greece. The FTSE is down 16 points, 0.3%, at 5832, with the German Dax, French Cac, Spanish Ibex all down. Only Italy's FTSE MIB is up this morning. \"Rogue institution\" (according to at least one New York lawyer) Standard Chartered leads the biggest risers this morning, up 22.5p to \u00a313.38, but still a long way off the levels before New York's attorney general's office accused the bank of funnelling $250bn of Iranian cash. The bank's bosses are due to meet with prosecutors in Manhattan on Wednesday to bash out a deal to the allegations, which they deny. At the other end, oil and gas services company, Petrofac, is bringing up the rear, leading the biggest fallers after lacklustre first half results. Delays in some contracts coming up for tender has left analysts unimpressed despite pretax profits were up 32% to $325.3m for the first six months of the year and a 21% jump in the dividend. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets said While figures are solid and ahead of some broker expectations, allowing the company to increase its interim dividend by a healthy 21%, its guidance and outlook statement are a disappointment.
