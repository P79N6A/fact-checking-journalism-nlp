      "bodyText": "Couriers who deliver parcels for Marks &amp; Spencer, River Island and John Lewis face being charged \u00a3150 a day if they cannot find cover when they are ill. Drivers for the multinational company DPD, which also makes home deliveries for Amazon and Asos, told the Guardian the contractual threat meant they sometimes forced themselves to work when sick. One driver in the east of England said his manager charged him \u00a3150 last year when he couldn\u2019t work because of an upset stomach. \u201cI said I couldn\u2019t come in because I was too sick and it wouldn\u2019t have been safe for me to drive,\u201d said the driver, who did not wish to be named. \u201cHe said: \u2018Sorry, I have to charge you.\u2019\u201d DPD uses about 5,000 couriers in the UK, many of whom are self-employed and are only paid when they work. It made more than \u00a3100m in profit in 2015, according to its latest accounts, amid rapidly rising demand for online shopping. Earnings lost from missing a day\u2019s deliveries were compounded if couriers could not arrange cover and DPD levied \u201cliquidated damages\u201d. When that happened a courier, who typically earns \u00a3200 a day, not only lost their pay but another \u00a3150, taking their total loss to \u00a3350. Frank Field, who chairs of the Commons work and pensions committee, said the arrangement was appalling. Drivers said the charges seemed to be applied inconsistently, at managers\u2019 discretion, and that they represented a constant threat. A spokesman for DPD, which is part of the international parcel group GeoPost, which has a turnover of \u00a35bn, defended its right to recover costs if couriers missed rounds. \u201cDPD franchisee drivers are not fined for being off work sick,\u201d he said. \u201cFranchisees are contracted to provide a service \u2013 if they are unable to provide that service themselves they are required to provide a substitute driver. If they fail to do so, DPD have to fulfil that service and therefore reserve the right to charge the franchisee for the costs involved in doing so.\u201d A courier\u2019s contract shown to the Guardian states: \u201cIf the franchisee fails to ensure that the service vehicle, the service equipment and the driver are available to perform the services when requested by GeoPost the franchisee shall at GeoPost\u2019s option pay ... for any loss sustained by GeoPost the sum of \u00a3150 per day or \u00a375 for any part of a day.\u201d There is growing concern at Westminster that workers in the gig economy are missing out on important protections, including the minimum wage, sick pay and holiday pay. On Friday, the Office for National Statistics revealed that the number of people on zero-hours contracts had hit a record high. The number of employees without any guaranteed hours grew by 13% last year to hit 910,000. \u201cThe gig economy is producing wave after wave of evidence on the grim reality of life at the bottom of Britain\u2019s labour market,\u201d said Field, whose committee is holding a parliamentary inquiry into the gig economy. \u201cA group of companies now controls the working lives of an unknown number of people, and yet evades its own responsibilities as employers and taxpayers by labelling those people as self-employed \u2026 This move [by DPD] makes the rest of the gig economy look as though it operates in the Garden of Eden.\u201d DPD couriers deliver 1.6m parcels a week in Britain. It stresses that its drivers are relatively well-paid and claimed that, after 12 months\u2019 service, they earned an annual average of \u00a337,000 after costs. The practice of sometimes charging drivers who could not find cover for missed shifts is believed to have been in operation for several years. DPD said that when it established the franchisee scheme it \u201cobtained clearance from HM Revenue &amp; Customs to ensure that franchisees were genuinely self-employed and that the scheme was fully compliant with relevant legislation and good practice\u201d. It said it had since received HMRC clearance over further changes to the arrangements. \u201cThese drivers own their own franchise and run their own businesses,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a \u2018lifestyle\u2019 option, and the scheme differs from that run by a number of other companies.\u201d However, one courier said DPD\u2019s compulsory training, its use of a rota which is emailed regularly to drivers, a uniform, and the requirement to use DPD\u2019s handheld computers meant \u201cit is not real self-employment, it is employment\u201d. Another claimed: \u201cWe have to adhere to the same procedures as employed people. The only difference is that we don\u2019t get any holiday pay or sick pay and we have no rights at all.\u201d River Island and John Lewis declined to comment. A spokesperson for M&amp;S said: \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment on the specific detail of DPD\u2019s contracts.\u201d Asos and Amazon did not respond to inquiries. For other companies that use large self-employed workforces, the question of whether they are genuinely being self-employed is being tested through the courts. This week the ride-hailing app Uber was granted the right to appeal against an employment tribunal ruling that its drivers were not self-employed, but were workers. If upheld, it will mean Uber must pay the minimum wage, sick pay and holiday pay.",

Sainsbury\u2019s is to scrap the role of price controller within its supermarkets, which will lead to hundreds of jobs being cut. Price controllers ensure that the price labels on supermarket shelves are accurate but this task will now be undertaken by other workers. The affected workers will be offered redundancy or other roles elsewhere in the grocery chain. Sainsbury\u2019s is also scrapping the night shift in 140 supermarkets. This will affect 4,000 workers, who will be offered early morning or late evening shifts instead. Unite, the trade union, urged Sainsbury\u2019s to guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies. Julia Long, Unite\u2019s national officer for food and drink, said: \u201cThis is very bad news for those dedicated workers affected by the planned job losses and Unite will be giving our members maximum support at this difficult time. \u201cWe appreciate that Sainsbury\u2019s has a good record of redeployment of staff in these situations and we will be exploring every avenue to ensure continuing employment for our members. \u201cWe are now entering the 45-day consultation period and will be having meetings with management, including asking the company if it has done an equalities\u2019 audit of those affected by today\u2019s announcement.\u201d Britain\u2019s biggest four food retailers \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 are overhauling their business models in response to dramatic changes in how Britain buys its food.

They are trying to offset this by making their shops more efficient and cheaper to run. A Sainsbury\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cWe regularly review our business to ensure we are operating as efficiently and effectively as possible and our resources are in the right place, so that we can provide our customers with the best possible service. \u201cFollowing a recent review, we are making some changes to administrative roles and night shift patterns in a number of stores, subject to consultation. \u201cWe appreciate this will be a difficult time for those colleagues affected by the changes and will support them in any way we can.\u201d The news from Sainsbury\u2019s has emerged in the same week that nearly 1,400 UK jobs were put at risk by pharmacy chain Boots, Walkers crisps, and bakery retailer Greggs. Around 600 jobs are at risk at nine Greggs bakeries while Walkers, which is owned by US food and drink group PepsiCo, is planning to close its manufacturing plant in Peterlee, Durham, by the end of the year. Boots is shutting more than two-thirds of its photo processing laboratories as demand for traditional photo processing falls, putting up to 400 jobs at risk.",

      "bodyText": "Unlike the Markit survey, the latest Institute for Supply Management report shows stronger than expected growth in the service sector. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.6 in February, up from 56.5 in January and better than the forecasts of 56.5. This is the highest level since October 2015. At 61.2, up from 58.6 in January, the new orders index is at its best since August 2015. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. The first of two surveys of the US service sector has come in marginally below expectations and lower than the previous month. The Markit services PMI for February fell from 55.6 in January to 53.8, below the initial estimate of 53.9. The composite index was 54.1, down from the first reading of 54.3 and the January figure of 55.8. US markets have made an uncertain start to trading after Thursday\u2019s falls. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 25 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.07% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.11%. Meanwhile, at the start of the second day of its life as a public company, Snapchat owner Snap followed its 44% first day rise by climbing another 8.8%. It was helped by news that NBC Universal said it had invested $500m in Snap at the flotation. But analysts at Pivotal Research were negative on the company, putting a $10 price target on the shares: Snap is a promising early stage company with significant opportunity ahead of itself. Unfortunately, it is significantly overvalued given the likely scale of its long-term opportunity and the risks associated with executing against that opportunity. Significant ongoing dilution from share-based compensation will likely represent an additional negative consideration for the stock. We value Snap at $10 per share on a 2017 basis. As the stock priced well above this level in its IPO, we rate its shares sell. Meanwhile Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras appears positive about the current talks with creditors: Over to Greece where politicians, economists and policy makers have been discussing the county\u2019s outlook at the annual Delphi Economic Forum. Our correspondent Helena Smith caught up with Greece\u2019s Tourism chief there: Tourism, Greece\u2019s great economic engine, is about to sputter into action, with a new record that will finally help generate growth. Speaking to the Guardian on the sidelines of the Delphi Economic Forum, Greece\u2019s Tourism chief Andreas Andreadis said figures released by airport authorities showed an extra 1.5 million airline seats were planned this year. \u201cWith the expected increase in seat occupancy we will see around two million more arrivals with around 200,000 of that number from the UK. This time, last year, we were in the midst of the refugee crisis and Spain was the big winner. Now Greece is the big winner.\u201d The boost will bring in an anticipated \u20ac1bn in extra revenues which would grow GDP by about one percent, he said. Last year sector revenues had declined despite the evident rise in arrivals with visitors spending much less per capita. \u201cThis will be another record year but, more importantly, it will be a year when real growth will start and tourism will be the main reason,\u201d Andreadis added insisting that what Greece most needed was a ten-year growth plan and a roadmap to implement it. \u201cThe memoranda,\u201d he said referring to the terms and conditions attached to the three bailouts Athens has received since 2010, \u201cwill not lead us out of crisis. What we need is vision and a roadmap to implement it.\u201d Gold is set for its biggest weekly fall for nearly four months on the growing prospect of a US rate rise in March. The precious metal is priced in dollars and so is sensitive to increases in the US currency. It is currently down $5 an ounce at $1,229. But oil has edged higher, recovering a little from recent falls on concerns about whether Russia would cut production in line with a recent deal among producers. Brent crude is up 0.47% at $55.34 a barrel. Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: Both oil contracts have bounced back a little after Thursday\u2019s sharp plunge. The all-time high crude stockpile levels in the US is the number one reason behind oil\u2019s inability to move further higher in recent weeks. With net long positions on both contracts being at record high levels, it could be that money managers and other large speculators are beginning to unwind those positions, providing additional pressure on prices. The latest positioning data from the CFTC tonight and ICE on Monday may reflect this view point. Also, the fact that there were no further cuts in Russian oil production in February means it will take a little bit longer for the global oversupply to drain. Essentially though, the long-term bearish trend has ended and I still think prices will break further higher later on this year as evidence of a tighter oil market emerges. Weakness in the pound after the dip in UK service sector growth has done little to prop up the FTSE 100. Normally a dip in sterling would boost the leading index due to its preponderance of overseas earners, but it is currently down 0.22% at 7366. The pound is 0.34% lower at $1.2224 against the dollar - having earlier dropped to $1.2215 - and down 0.67% against the euro at \u20ac1.1594. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Part of the reason sterling\u2019s slide against the euro was so aggressive was that the Eurozone\u2019s own services PMI hit a near 6 year peak of 55.5 (a smidge lower than what was forecast). This prevented the DAX from getting out of the red, the German index shedding 30 points; the CAC, however, managed to rise 0.5% thanks to the most recent French election polls placing Emmanuel Macron ahead of Marine Le Pen in the first round of voting. After Snap\u2019s jet-fuelled stock market debut on Thursday - a 44% surge which values the Snapchat owner at $28bn - the company\u2019s shares are being indicated higher again. The future market is currently showing a 1.3% rise to $24.80, but now the company is listed it has to prove itself, say analysts. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Snap duly delivered on the hype that surrounded its IPO, with a 44% gain in the share price on day one echoing the heady days of the dot-com bubble. The underwriters and company management will be pleased to see the stock in such high demand, but the easy work is now behind it. Snap is now just another company on the New York stock exchange, and will be judged by the same metrics as others of its ilk. It has to show real user growth from this point onwards, and a firm strategy for making money off those users. And Garry White, chief investment commentator at Charles Stanley, warned: For a company that is losing almost half a billion dollars a year, may never be profitable and faces aggressive competition from larger peers, this valuation seems stratospheric. The reason is the company\u2019s popularity with teenagers and millennials, who are prized targets for advertisers. However, this industry remains extremely fickle (remember MySpace and Friends Reunited?) and many investors piling in not wishing to miss \u201cthe next big thing\u201d are unlikely to have used the app themselves. Investors tend not to be teenagers. Warren Buffett says he will never invest in a business he doesn\u2019t understand, this may be advice well worth heeding for those tempted to take a nibble of Snap. Over in Greece, the country\u2019s prime minister tweets: The UK is entering stagflation - high inflation and stagnant growth - warns Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said: The decline in the services PMI to a five-month low in February is the clearest sign yet that the U.K. now is enduring stagflation. The business activity index is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in output in the non-distribution private services sector slowing to around 0.2% in the first quarter from 0.7% in the fourth quarter. Granted, the PMI often is influenced excessively by sentiment and it was far too downbeat immediately after the referendum. But the recent rally in equity prices should have boosted corporate confidence. In addition, the services PMI was too downbeat last year because it excludes the retail sector, which benefited from a surge in consumer spending. Evidence on retail spending so far this year has been disappointingly weak. The services sector looks vulnerable to slowing sharply over the coming months now that businesses are rising prices rapidly. Indeed, the output prices balance rose to 54.1 in February\u2014its highest level since September 2008\u2014from 53.7 in January. In the past, the business activity index has tended to weaken over the following six months whenever the output prices index has exceeded 52. Accordingly, we continue to expect quarter-on-quarter GDP growth to average just 0.2% this year, ensuring that the MPC holds back from raising interest rates despite high inflation. Back with the UK, and the PMI data confirms the country\u2019s economy is likely to see slower growth this year, according to Daniel Vernazza, lead UK economist at UniCredit Research. He said: The bigger than expected fall in the services PMI adds to the mounting evidence in recent weeks that the UK economy is slowing. It fits with the recent fall in retail sales amid a squeeze in real household income growth. We continue to expect growth to slow this year and for the UK economy to decouple from firming global economic activity... The weaker headline figure, which refers to output/business activity, was also reflected in the detail of the report. The new orders balance fell 1.3pts. to 54.7, and both backlogs-of-work and future business expectations edged down. Set against this, the employment balance rose. There are two salient explanations for the recent softness. First, the squeeze in real household income growth (resulting from higher imported inflation) is weighing on demand, particularly for retail services... Second, Brexit-related economic uncertainty remains high and this will increasingly weigh on business investment as the date when the UK formally leaves the EU (spring 2019) approaches. The composite PMI... fell to 53.6 in February, down from an average of 55.4 in the final quarter of last year. The sectorial breakdown clearly reveals that the weakness in the UK economy is domestic, with the export-oriented manufacturing sector performing relatively well and supported by the past depreciation of sterling and firming global economic activity (particularly in Europe). Based on the historical relationship between the composite PMI and real GDP growth, the PMIs in February would be consistent with a quarterly real GDP growth rate of around 0.3%-0.4% quarter on quarter. We keep our forecast for first quarter 2017 real GDP growth of 0.3% quarter on quarter. Despite weak eurozone retail sales figures, shopkeepers remain optimistic about the outlook, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank: Not all that glitters is gold as strong Eurozone economic surveys mask weak performance in retail at the start of the year. The outlook for domestic demand does remain positive though, even under higher inflation rates. While surveys about the Eurozone economy in 2017 have been very upbeat so far, retail sales disappointed in January. The 0.1% month on month decline is the third in a row, while year on year growth is just 1.2%. This suggests that recent Eurozone optimism is not translating into more shopping at the moment. One factor probably influencing this is the rebound of inflation in recent months, bringing price growth back to 2% in the Eurozone. Nominal wage growth has been below 2% since 2013, indicating that real wages are suffering from the recent rebound in prices. Retailers confirmed the current weakness in demand in the Economic Sentiment Indicator as the February survey showed a strong decline in the assessment of the present business situation. Even though recent months have disappointed, retailers do remain optimistic about business in the months ahead. This probably makes sense, given the strength in the job market and relative optimism among consumers. Today\u2019s composite PMI numbers confirm that strength in the economy. Still though, this could be a sign for Eurozone growth that domestic demand could be impacted by declining real wages, although we expect consumer spending to remain robust in the first quarter. The eurozone may be starting to fire on all cylinders according to the PMIs, but the region\u2019s shopkeepers may not agree. Eurozone retail sales fell by 0.1% month on month in January, the third fall in a row and contradicting expectations of a 0.4% increase. The year on year figure was a rise of 1.2% but this was lower than the forecast 1.6% increase. The December figure was revised down from a 0.3% fall to one of 0.5% despite the supposed boost from Christmas shoppers. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The pace of growth in the UK services sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of GDP, slipped slightly in February according to survey data released today... 2017 looks set to be a relatively challenging year for the economy, with higher inflation and weaker pay growth likely to squeeze household budgets. This means consumer spending could slow in real terms. Today\u2019s figure, along with the equivalent readings for the manufacturing and construction sectors, point to 0.4% GDP growth in the first quarter. Overall, however, the economic picture remains more positive than many expected after last year\u2019s vote to leave the EU. A PMI reading above 50 shows the sector is still expanding, albeit at its slowest pace since September. The survey showed that business confidence remained strong, and sentiment about the rest of the year was largely positive. Nevertheless, with uncertainty still rife over how and when the UK will actually leave the EU, and survey data pointing to a modest slowing of activity, the Bank of England looks most unlikely to consider raising interest rates in the near to medium term. The pound slipped back to a day\u2019s low of $1.2227 against the dollar immediately after the PMI figures, with analysts suggesting the weakness in the economy was more likely to lead to lower interest rates for longer. This is a seven week low against the US currency, while the pound has also fallen against the euro, down 0.5% to \u20ac1.1617. Chris Williamson, chief business economist of survey compiler Markit, said: Weaker consumer spending was a key cause of slower service sector growth, suggesting that household budgets are starting to crack under the strain of higher prices and weak wage growth. The ongoing steep upturn in costs suggest that consumer price inflation has significantly further to rise, adding to our belief that inflation will breach 3% over the course of the next year. Despite this, Williamson said the PMI data was more consistent with further easing by the Bank of England. He said: The slowdown in the pace of economic growth signalled by the February surveys pushes the PMI back towards territory more indicative of additional policy stimulus from the Bank of England than a tightening. The UK\u2019s service sector grew more slowly than expected in February, mainly due to a slowdown in consumer spending. The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers index fell from 54.5 in January to 53.3, its weakest performance since last September and lower than the 54.2 figure expected by economists. Markit said the figures - along with the earlier manufacturing and construction data - suggested first quarter growth of below 0.4% compared with 0.7% in the final three months of 2016. The data comes ahead of this month\u2019s Budget and ahead of the government\u2019s plan to trigger Article 50 and begin the process of leaving the European Union. The positive figures from the eurozone may not last, according to Howard Archer, chief european and UK economist at IHS Markit. He said: The final purchasing managers\u2019 survey confirmed Eurozone services activity really stepped up a gear in February to be at a 69-month high. Significantly and encouragingly, It was not only business activity that saw a long-term high, but also incoming new business, outstanding business and business expectations. Employment growth also accelerated. Furthermore, with Eurozone manufacturing expansion picking up modestly further to a 70-month high, Markit report that overall Eurozone manufacturing and services output in February was at the best level since April 2011. The markedly overall improved February purchasing managers\u2019 surveys indicate that the Eurozone economy is seeing a robust first quarter of 2017 after solid if unspectacular growth in the second half of 2016. However, we suspect the Eurozone may find it difficult to kick on amid appreciable political uncertainties during 2017 and likely reduced consumer purchasing power due to higher inflation and limited wage growth in most countries. A dip in Eurozone consumer confidence in February fuels this suspicion. Consequently, we suspect that Eurozone GDP growth will be 1.6%. The positive mood continues with news that eurozone businesses grew at their fastest rate since April 2011. The Markit composite index - manufacturing and services - rose to 56 in February from 54.4 the previous month. The service sector index itself climbed from 53.7 in January to 55.5. Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said: The final PMI numbers paint a bright picture of a eurozone economy starting to fire on all cylinders. Growth accelerated in all of the four largest member states in February to suggest an increasingly sustainable and robust-looking upturn. The broad-based improvement has pushed the eurozone PMI into territory consistent with 0.6% GDP growth in the first quarter. The labour market is also starting to boom, with jobs being created at the fastest rate for nearly a decade. The strength of the eurozone economy could give the European Central Bank pause for thought in its current quantitive easing and low interest rate programmes: Any change to the ECB\u2019s policy would go down well in Germany, which has been upset by the negative effect of low interest rates on the country\u2019s savers. And making a hat-trick of positive performances, Germany service sector has also improved in February after hitting a four month low at the start of the year. Markit\u2019s services PMI for the country rose from 53.4 in January to 54.4, while the composite index climbed from 54.8 to a 34 month high of 56.1 in February. Markit economist Trevor Balchin said: The latest PMI data add to our expectations that economic growth will strengthen in the first quarter to at least 0.6% quarter on quarter, marking a strong start to 2017. The French service sector also put in a strong performance last month, with its fastest pace of expansion since May 2011. IHS Markit said its services PMI index came in at 56.4 in February, up from 54.1 the previous month but slightly lower than the initial estimate of 56.7. The composite index of services and manufacturing rose to 55.9 from 54.1. The sector was boosted by a recovery in the hotel and restaurant business which had previously suffered after a fall in tourism. And strongly out of the traps is Italy, which has just reported its strongest service sector growth since December 2015. The Markit business activity index for services companies jumped from 52.4 in January to 54.1 last month, well above the 53.1 expected by analysts. This follows a positive performance in the manufacturing survey released on Wednesday, helping lift the composite index for both sectors from 52.8 to 54.8. The figures make good reading for prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, who has been in the post for almost three months. WPP is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down nearly 6% after it lowered its growth forecast for the year. WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell also had things to say about corporate governance: WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell has said that companies with dominant shareholders or owners such as Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox, Facebook and Snap that \u201coffend\u201d good corporate governance practices take more risks and tend to perform better financially. Sorrell was speaking the day after Snapchat parent Snap floated on Wall Street, with the offering oversubscribed and the share price rising more than 44% to $24 on its first day of trading, despite co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy and early investors keeping total control of voting rights. He said that WPP has found over a decade of measuring brand valuations that when markets hit tough patches it is companies with dominant shareholders or owners that tend to continue to invest perform best. The full story is here: The dip in markets so far could be reversed if the service sector figures look reasonable, suggests Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. He said: After effectively sitting out Thursday, the European markets decided to give back some of the week\u2019s rapid growth this morning. Shedding 25 points after the bell, the FTSE started Friday holding above 7350. A smattering of red in its mining sector, and perhaps just a bit of doubt about just how high the index currently sits, seemed responsible for the FTSE\u2019s fall. The pound saw similar losses, slipping to a fresh 6 week nadir against the dollar while handing 0.2% in value back to the euro. Sentiment could shift, however, dependant on the state of the latest services PMI. Analysts are expecting the figure to dip from 54.5 to 54.2 month-on-month, though this week those estimates haven\u2019t been very accurate, with the manufacturing and construction PMIs under- and out-performing forecasts respectively. If the services reading can avoid a February dip then the pound may be lifted away from its current lows; if not than sterling\u2019s decline may well intensify. Like in the UK, the Eurozone indices looked a bit weary this morning. The DAX slid 0.4% thanks to a sharp drop in German retail sales, though the index managed to cling on above 12000, while the CAC fell back towards 4950 with a 0.1% decline. The region\u2019s services data is expectedly to be relatively strong, with the Eurozone-wide figure set to be confirmed at 55.6 for February compared to 53.7 in January, hitting a 6-ish year high in the process. As forecast, investors are pausing for breath again after the recent record breaking run in shares. The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.27|% to 7362, Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.5%, France\u2019s Cac is 0.3% lower and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 0.41%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex has lost 0.5%. And Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 has opened 0.3% lower. The London Stock Exchange, currently in the throes of a merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, has reported a 21% rise in pretax profit to \u00a3623m, in line with expectations. The dividend is higher than expected at 43.2p a share rather than 38p, which the LSE says reflects a strong outlook. Earlier in the week, the LSE suggested that a last minute demand from Brussels to sell its 60% share in Italian business MTS could scupper the \u00a324bn deal. But there was no mention of this in today\u2019s statement. Numis analyst Jonathan Goslin said: There is little new revealed in the outlook statement. The company still claims: \u201cThe Group continues to work hard on its proposed merger with Deutsche Bo\u0308rse AG - awaiting outcome of the European Commission Phase II process on or before 3 April 2017\u201d. We continue to favour [the LSE\u2019s] strong market position, favourable growth drivers and diversified revenue base. However, the shares are up with events in our view, especially given the downside risks should a deal with Deutsche B\u00f6rse not eventually be completed. Ahead of the splurge of service sector data, we have already had some disappointing German retail sales figures. They fell 0.8% month on month in January, compared to expectations of a 0.2% rise and an unchanged figure the previous month. But the year on year figure showed a 2.3% increase compared to a 0.4% rise in December. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a bit like Groundhog Day. On Tuesday there was a whole host of manufacturing data from around the globe - mostly showing a positive trend - and now we get the same thing but for the service sector. Things have kicked off with a slightly disappointing figure from China. The Caixin services PMI index slipped from 53.1 in January to 52.6 last month, down from 18 month highs. Elsewhere, after some weakness in February\u2019s UK manufacturing figure and a pick up in the construction sector, the services index is expected to show a dip, from 54.5 in January to 54.2 as rising prices put a brake on consumer demand. As for Europe, Michael Hewson at CMC Markets sums up expectations: In Europe... the latest Spain, Italy, France and Germany services numbers [are all] expected to show significant improvements on their January numbers, with increases to 55.1, 53.1, 56.7 and 54.4 respectively. In the US, there is expected to be a strong performance from the service sector, which is likely to add fuel to the growing belief that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as this month\u2019s meeting. Hewson again: The US remains the key driver of markets right now and the sudden hawkish stance of a number of previously dovish Fed officials has caught investors somewhat off guard in the past week or so, and pushing the prospect that we\u2019ll see another interest rate rise into a realistic prospect. In fact such has been the turnaround in expectations, that a rate move looks more or less a done deal. Today\u2019s US ISM services numbers for February are expected to underscore this increased optimism with an expectation that we\u2019ll see a robust 56.5, however the acid test will be later today when a week of Fed speakers concludes with four more FOMC voting members speaking about the US economy. That expectation has been pushing the dollar higher again, and as a consequence putting pressure on the pound. As it happens, sterling is currently flat against the dollar at $1.2265 but has edged 0.15% lower against the euro to \u20ac1.1653. Meawhile after Thursday\u2019s fall on Wall Street following its record breaking run and overnight dips in Asia, European markets are expected to open lower: On the corporate front there are results out from advertising giant WPP and the London Stock Exchange.",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decline in the services PMI to a five-month low in February is the clearest sign yet that the U.K. now is enduring stagflation.</p> <p>The business activity index is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in output in the non-distribution private services sector slowing to around 0.2% in the first quarter from 0.7% in the fourth quarter. Granted, the PMI often is influenced excessively by sentiment and it was far too downbeat immediately after the referendum. But the recent rally in equity prices should have boosted corporate confidence. In addition, the services PMI was too downbeat last year because it excludes the retail sector, which benefited from a surge in consumer spending. Evidence on retail spending so far this year has been disappointingly weak. </p> <p>The services sector looks vulnerable to slowing sharply over the coming months now that businesses are rising prices rapidly. Indeed, the output prices balance rose to 54.1 in February\u2014its highest level since September 2008\u2014from 53.7 in January. In the past, the business activity index has tended to weaken over the following six months whenever the output prices index has exceeded 52. Accordingly, we continue to expect quarter-on-quarter GDP growth to average just 0.2% this year, ensuring that the MPC holds back from raising interest rates despite high inflation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b94627e4b07c254ae21b72\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:41:02.470Z\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the UK, and the PMI data confirms the country\u2019s economy is likely to see slower growth this year, according to Daniel Vernazza, lead UK economist at UniCredit Research. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bigger than expected fall in the services PMI adds to the mounting evidence in recent weeks that the UK economy is slowing. It fits with the recent fall in retail sales amid a squeeze in real household income growth. We continue to expect growth to slow this year and for the UK economy to decouple from firming global economic activity...</p> <p>The weaker headline figure, which refers to output/business activity, was also reflected in the detail of the report. The new orders balance fell 1.3pts. to 54.7, and both backlogs-of-work and future business expectations edged down. Set against this, the employment balance rose.</p> <p>There are two salient explanations for the recent softness. First, the squeeze in real household income growth (resulting from higher imported inflation) is weighing on demand, particularly for retail services...</p> <p>Second, Brexit-related economic uncertainty remains high and this will increasingly weigh on business investment as the date when the UK formally leaves the EU (spring 2019) approaches.</p> <p>The composite PMI... fell to 53.6 in February, down from an average of 55.4 in the final quarter of last year. The sectorial breakdown clearly reveals that the weakness in the UK economy is domestic, with the export-oriented manufacturing sector performing relatively well and supported by the past depreciation of sterling and firming global economic activity (particularly in Europe). Based on the historical relationship between the composite PMI and real GDP growth, the PMIs in February would be consistent with a quarterly real GDP growth rate of around 0.3%-0.4% quarter on quarter. We keep our forecast for first quarter 2017 real GDP growth of 0.3% quarter on quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b9452ce4b09c1763ef5afc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:31:37.239Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite weak eurozone retail sales figures, shopkeepers remain optimistic about the outlook, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not all that glitters is gold as strong Eurozone economic surveys mask weak performance in retail at the start of the year. The outlook for domestic demand does remain positive though, even under higher inflation rates.</p> <p>While surveys about the Eurozone economy in 2017 have been very upbeat so far, retail sales disappointed in January. The 0.1% month on month decline is the third in a row, while year on year growth is just 1.2%. This suggests that recent Eurozone optimism is not translating into more shopping at the moment.</p> <p>One factor probably influencing this is the rebound of inflation in recent months, bringing price growth back to 2% in the Eurozone. Nominal wage growth has been below 2% since 2013, indicating that real wages are suffering from the recent rebound in prices.</p> <p>Retailers confirmed the current weakness in demand in the Economic Sentiment Indicator as the February survey showed a strong decline in the assessment of the present business situation.</p> <p>Even though recent months have disappointed, retailers do remain optimistic about business in the months ahead. This probably makes sense, given the strength in the job market and relative optimism among consumers.</p> <p>Today\u2019s composite PMI numbers confirm that strength in the economy. Still though, this could be a sign for Eurozone growth that domestic demand could be impacted by declining real wages, although we expect consumer spending to remain robust in the first quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:37:32.964Z\">at 10.37am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b93eeee4b047c20d904ea7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:12:12.168Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone retail sales slip</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The eurozone may be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/mar/03/markets-edge-lower-ahead-of-service-sector-figures-business-live?page=with:block-58b9318ee4b047c20d904e66#block-58b9318ee4b047c20d904e66\">starting to fire on all cylinders</a> according to the PMIs, but the region\u2019s shopkeepers may not agree.</p> <p>Eurozone retail sales fell by 0.1% month on month in January, the third fall in a row and contradicting expectations of a 0.4% increase.

A smattering of red in its mining sector, and perhaps just a bit of doubt about just how high the index currently sits, seemed responsible for the FTSE\u2019s fall. The pound saw similar losses, slipping to a fresh 6 week nadir against the dollar while handing 0.2% in value back to the euro. </p> <p>Sentiment could shift, however, dependant on the state of the latest services PMI. Analysts are expecting the figure to dip from 54.5 to 54.2 month-on-month, though this week those estimates haven\u2019t been very accurate, with the manufacturing and construction PMIs under- and out-performing forecasts respectively. If the services reading can avoid a February dip then the pound may be lifted away from its current lows; if not than sterling\u2019s decline may well intensify.</p> <p>Like in the UK, the Eurozone indices looked a bit weary this morning. The DAX slid 0.4% thanks to a sharp drop in German retail sales, though the index managed to cling on above 12000, while the CAC fell back towards 4950 with a 0.1% decline. The region\u2019s services data is expectedly to be relatively strong, with the Eurozone-wide figure set to be confirmed at 55.6 for February compared to 53.7 in January, hitting a 6-ish year high in the process.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T08:41:22.936Z\">at 8.41am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b92397e4b09c1763ef5a80\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T08:07:47.431Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets open lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As forecast, investors are pausing for breath again after the recent record breaking run in shares.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.27|% to 7362, Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.5%, France\u2019s Cac is 0.3% lower and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 0.41%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex has lost 0.5%.</p> <p>And Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 has opened 0.3% lower.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b9201ce4b07c254ae21aea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T07:56:52.885Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The London Stock Exchange, currently in the throes of a merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, has reported a 21% rise in pretax profit to \u00a3623m, in line with expectations.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The culture secretary has said that she is likely to refer Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn takeover bid for Sky to Ofcom to investigate issues of media plurality and whether Fox will maintain broadcasting standards at the pay-TV company. Karen Bradley, who has 10 working days from Monday to make a final decision on referring the deal to the media regulator, said that she is \u201cminded to\u201d issue an intervention notice to call in Ofcom to examine the deal. \u201cI have, today, written to the parties to inform them that I am \u2018minded to\u2019 issue a European intervention notice on the basis that I have concerns that there may be public interest considerations,\u201d she said, in a statement issued minutes after the European commission confirmed that Fox had formally notified it about the takeover bid. \u201cTo be clear \u2013 I have not taken a final decision on intervention at this stage. In line with the guidance that applies to my quasi-judicial role I am inviting written representations from the parties and will aim to come to a final decision on whether to intervene in the merger within 10 working days of today\u2019s notification.\u201d Bradley said she was minded to intervene on the basis of two public interest grounds specified in the Enterprise Act. The first of these is whether Fox\u2019s takeover will raise issues of UK media plurality and concentration in Murdoch\u2019s control. The second is on whether Fox is committed to the required editorial standards, such as accuracy and impartial news coverage. \u201cThis ground relates to the need for persons carrying on media enterprises, and for those with control of such enterprises, to have a genuine commitment to attaining broadcasting standards objectives,\u201d said Bradley. \u201cThis is not an announcement of my final decision in relation to intervention, but an indication of what I am presently minded to do.\u201d Bradley said Fox and Sky have until 5pm on 8 March to make representations about the deal to the Department for Culture Media and Sport, with her final decision being delivered in the week commencing 13 March. If asked, Ofcom will carry out a public interest test on the deal, reporting back within 40 days. If there are no concerns, Bradley must clear the bid. If Ofcom raises concerns, however, she must decide whether to accept an undertaking from Fox to address them. In 2011, Murdoch\u2019s bid for Sky resulted in a deal to spin off Sky News to quell media plurality issues before the takeover was abandoned. Murdoch\u2019s son James, now chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, has already said he does not believe any \u201cmeaningful concessions\u201d will need to be made to authorities this time round. \u201cAs we have previously indicated, we anticipate regulators will undertake a thorough review of the transaction, and we look forward to engaging with them as appropriate,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Fox. \u201cWe ... are confident that the transaction will be approved based on a compelling fact set.\u201d European regulators have up to 25 days to look at competition issues but are likely to clear the takeover as they previously gave the green light to the original bid late in 2010, as well as Sky\u2019s \u00a37bn deal in 2014 to buy its sister operations in Germany and Italy. Fox\u2019s deal to snap up the 61% of Sky it does not already own will give Murdoch control of Sky News and pay-TV operations in the UK, Germany, Austria and Italy. His ownership of UK news media also includes the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun as well as radio group TalkSport, which he controls through a separate company, News Corp. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s shadow culture secretary, said that the bid should have been referred for scrutiny \u201cimmediately and without equivocation\u201d. \u201cIt is clear that Fox\u2019s bid to take full control of Sky will significantly increase the size of the biggest media organisation in the UK and further concentrate power in the hands of a dominant industry player,\u201d he said. \u201cThe culture secretary must now ensure MPs are given an opportunity to debate the deal before a decision is taken on whether to approve it.\u201d An Ofcom investigation found in 2012 that Sky remained a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of a broadcast licence, despite the phone-hacking affair that embroiled its then parent company. However, it published a scathing assessment of James Murdoch \u2013 then the chief executive of his father\u2019s UK newspaper group and chairman of Sky \u2013 finding that his conduct repeatedly fell short of the standards expected. Ofcom has the right at any stage to launch a new investigation. However, the regulator has had a chance to air any concerns about James Murdoch and Sky since it was announced he was returning as chairman in January. In October, he had to rely on the support of Fox, Sky\u2019s largest shareholder, to win approval for his return after more than 50% of independent shareholders voted against his reappointment. \u201cThe public has serious doubts as to whether Rupert Murdoch is fit to take even more control over the UK\u2019s media,\u201d said Maggie Chao, from campaigning group 38 Degrees. \u201cMemories of the phone hacking scandal are still fresh. That\u2019s why more than 230,000 have signed a petition demanding the Sky deal is referred to Ofcom.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two drugs firms have been accused by the competition watchdog of making illegal deals in order to inflate the price for life-saving hydrocortisone tablets in the UK. It is alleged that Actavis UK incentivised its rival Concordia not to enter the market with its own version of the tablets so that it could remain the sole supplier of the drug in the UK and charge higher prices. The agreements were made between January 2013 and June 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) claimed, and enabled Actavis to increase the price it charged the NHS by 80% over the period from \u00a349 to \u00a388 per pack. Hydrocortisone tablets are prescribed to people whose adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones, such as those suffering from Addison\u2019s disease. About 1m prescriptions of the drug were distributed last year. Andrew Groves, the CMA\u2019s senior responsible officer for the investigation, said: \u201cAnti-competitive agreements can cost the NHS, and ultimately the taxpayer, by stopping competition bringing down the cost of lifesaving drugs like hydrocortisone tablets. \u201cWe allege these agreements were intended to keep Actavis UK as the sole supplier of a drug relied on by thousands of patients \u2013 and in a position which could allow it to dictate and prolong high prices.\u201d The regulator said at this stage the findings were provisional and that it would carefully consider any representations made by Actavis and Concordia. The two companies face hefty fines if the CMA concludes they broke competition law. The investigation is part of a wider clampdown by the regulator on the pharmaceutical industry. It fined Pfizer a record \u00a384.2m in December, after finding the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug was increased overnight by up to 2,600%. In this latest case, the CMA alleges that Actavis supplied Concordia, formerly Amdipharm, with a fixed supply of its own 10mg hydrocortisone tablets for a very low price. Concordia then resold the product to customers in the UK. Actavis remained the sole supplier of the tablets in the UK during most of this period, and because the drug was generic, it was not subject to price regulation. Actavis was already under investigation by the regulator, accused of overcharging the NHS for the tablets, after hiking prices by 12,000% over the course of several years. Prices rose from 70p a pack in April 2008 to \u00a388 by March 2016. A spokesperson for Actavis said the company was not commenting on the ongoing investigation. Concordia International said it was cooperating with the CMA. \u201cWe believe that the conduct of Amdipharm was not in breach of competition law. We will review the CMA\u2019s provisional position as set out in its statement of objections and then intend to respond in detail to it,\u201d it said. \u201cAs previously disclosed, we are cooperating fully with the CMA in this investigation. We believe that the supply arrangement between Auden Mckenzie, which was acquired by Actavis in 2015, and Amdipharm for full-indication 10mg hydrocortisone tablets did not infringe competition law.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "If there is just one anecdote that succinctly sums up the problems that Brexit and the threat of tariffs pose to the UK car industry, it is this: the story behind the crankshaft used in the BMW Mini, which crosses the Channel three times in a 2,000-mile journey before the finished car rolls off the production line. A cast of the raw crankshaft \u2013 the part of the car that translates the movement of the pistons into the rotational motion required to move the vehicle \u2013 is made by a supplier based in France. From there it is shipped to BMW\u2019s Hams Hall plant in Warwickshire, where it is drilled and milled into shape. When that job is complete, each crankshaft is then sent back across the Channel to Munich, where it inserted into the engine. From Munich, it is back to the Mini plant in Oxford, where the engine is then \u201cmarried\u201d with the car. If the car is to be sold on the continent then the crankshaft, inside the finished motor, will cross the Channel for a fourth time. Another well-travelled car part is the Bentley bumper. It is made in eastern Europe before being sent to Crewe for further work, then on to Germany for finishing and finally back to Crewe where it is added to the luxury vehicle. The UK automotive industry is right at the centre of concerns about what damage Brexit might inflict on the British economy \u2013 because the expansion of car plants since the financial crisis is based on remarkable levels of cooperation with suppliers on the continent. The 1.72m cars produced in the UK last year was a 17-year high and by 2020 production is currently expected to top the all-time high of 2m achieved in 1972. But on average, just 41% of the parts used in a car assembled in the UK are actually produced in the country. Bosses in the automotive industry are not just concerned about the impact of tariffs on vehicles made in the UK that are sold abroad, but on the parts used to make them, and whether they will still be able to move parts across the Channel quickly and affordably. The modern automotive industry supply chain means that some car parts go back and forth across the Channel far more times than a Mini crankshaft before reaching the final assembly line. \u201cThe automotive industry has potentially exploited the single market more than any other sector,\u201d Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said. \u201cThere are hundreds and thousands of movements per car. Anything that changes or puts barriers to that free flow of parts will have an effect. It is fundamental to the efficiency in this country.\u201d The speed at which parts are moved from factory to factory is critical. Most car plants in Britain operate with what is known as \u201cjust-in-time\u201d (JIT) production, an idea imported from Japan. This involves components being added straight to the car when they arrive at the factory rather than being stored in a warehouse. The system dramatically improves the productivity of the plant \u2013 but any interruption to supply can bring production to an immediate halt. Tim Lawrence, head of manufacturing at PA Consulting, said: \u201cThey schedule components on the production line and sequence it so parts arrive only hours before. You may think that sounds straightforward, but there is quite an art to this JIT supply chain. If you put a customs unit in place [because you are no longer part of a single market] things could be delayed at the border for a couple of day \u2013 it really has an impact.\u201d Theresa May has already warned that Britain is likely to leave the single market and customs union as part of Brexit, meaning the free movement of goods could end. This could have severe implications, Lawrence warns. \u201cThere are two ways [for a carmaker] to approach it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could look to bring components into the UK to manufacture, so it could have a positive impact. But the challenge is if you are exporting 80% of the vehicles \u2013 like Nissan are or Vauxhall are from Ellesmere Port \u2013 you have to question the benefits of that if there will be tariffs on exports. \u201cThe margins are slim for OEMs [original equipment manufacturer] \u2013 5% to 10%. If you add a 10% tariff you could charge the customer more \u2013 which is unlikely \u2013 or you look at it very quickly and say \u2018It\u2019s going to to cost us hundreds of millions of pounds a year or the cost of a new plant is \u00a3800m to \u00a31bn, so let\u2019s move manufacturing\u2019.\u201d The industry \u2013 led by Hawes and the SMMT \u2013 is lobbying the government heavily about issues including tariff and bureaucracy-free arrangements for the movement of car parts in any agreement with the European Union. But it has also highlighted the need for complex rules around the origin of parts to be recognised. Existing trade deals between the EU and other countries include rules that products must have a certain proportion of parts built in their home market to avoid tariffs. For example, in the EU\u2019s agreement with South Korea 55% of the parts in a car must be sourced from Europe to qualify for free trade. These rules are an issue for the UK industry because less than half of parts in cars assembled in the country are sourced domestically. This means the government will need to persuade the EU and other countries with which it wants free-trade agreements that EU-sourced components should be classed as local content. As Lawrence suggested, UK manufacturers are already attempting to build up the supply chain in Britain and encourage major suppliers to open plants in the country. Colin Lawther, Nissan\u2019s senior vice-president of manufacturing supply chain, told MPs earlier this week that the Japanese company was prepared to spend up to \u00a32bn a year with British suppliers if its Sunderland factory could find parts locally. The Nissan executive warned that the future of the Sunderland plant will be at risk if the government does not provide \u00a3100m towards building the supply chain in Britain. Nissan\u2019s site \u2013 the largest car plant in the UK \u2013 uses 5m parts a day on a production line that makes two cars every minute. \u201cWe\u2019re talking two, three, four, six minutes\u2019 downtime a day interruption is a disaster,\u201d Lawther said. The coalition government oversaw a programme to boost the number of component makers in the UK in collaboration with the industry. The Automotive Investment Organisation \u2013 part of UK Trade and Investment \u2013 is still working to boost investment. However, Sir Vince Cable, the business secretary between 2010 and 2015, said the progress of the industry since the financial crisis was at risk. \u201cWhat is happening now is a shock to the system,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment it is all bits and pieces [of news] but it adds up to an industry that is unhappy and unsettled. \u201cThere are two things that will happen. Decisions over new models will switch away from the UK and I think when a company is face with tough decisions \u2013 like Vauxhall/Opel \u2013 the likelihood is it will go against the UK.\u201d Cable said there is likely to be \u201cintensive lobbying\u201d from the German government to protect jobs at Opel if PSA, the owner of Peugeot, completes a takeover of General Motors\u2019 European business. \u201cIts difficult to see what Britain can offer them [PSA] other than years of uncertainty,\u201d he warned.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy is cooling fast, according to the latest surveys of the services, manufacturing and construction sectors, bolstering expectations that the Bank of England will leave interest rates at their record low for the rest of this year and beyond. Coming days before Philip Hammond\u2019s spring budget, the figures add to evidence that the economic strength seen in after the Brexit vote, which put the UK\u2019s GDP growth in the front rank of developed nations, is now faltering. The financial data provider Markit, which compiled the surveys, said the slowing of business activity growth last month added to evidence that the economy has lost momentum after the \u201cimpressive expansion\u201d at the end of last year. Firms remained optimistic about the year ahead, but Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson, said: \u201cThe slowdown in the pace of economic growth signalled by the February surveys pushes the PMI [purchasing managers\u2019 index] back towards territory more indicative of additional policy stimulus from the Bank of England than a tightening. \u201cPolicymakers are therefore likely to continue to stress the need to look through any further upturn in inflation and focus instead on the need to keep policy accommodative in the face of a likely further slowing in the pace of economic growth in 2017.\u201d Threadneedle Street recently upgraded its growth forecasts for 2017, leading many analysts to predict that interest rates could start to rise towards the end of the year. But the slowdown in the first two months appears to show the economy could now struggle to hit the Bank\u2019s 2% growth forecast, further delaying the first interest rate rise since 2007. Nevertheless, the underlying strength of production and output across all the sectors in the second half of last year means the economy will continue to grow, prompting the Office for Budget Responsibility to pencil in higher growth than it had expected after the Brexit vote, allowing the chancellor to reduce his borrowing forecasts. Last autumn Hammond was expecting to borrow \u00a368bn in 2016-17, but the OBR is now expected to reduce this by at least \u00a310bn, close to the level predicted before the Brexit vote. The chancellor could add this saving to a \u00a327bn war chest he expects to achieve by 2020, or spend some of it to ease concerns that the social care system, health service and prisons are at breaking point. He is expected to use some of the funds to alleviate the worst effects of previous departmental budget cuts, but keep most of the funds for what he has cast as his main budget in the autumn. The Markit poll of purchasing managers in the services sector reflected similar surveys from the manufacturing and construction industries that showed firms were continuing to expand output and hire workers, but inflationary pressures from the rising cost of imported raw materials was making them wary of putting their foot on the accelerator. The services PMI remained in expansion mode during February at 53.3 \u2013 down from 54.5 in January, though still well above the 50.0 threshold that separates growth from contraction. Markit said the slowdown mainly reflected a softer pace of new business growth, with some respondents citing more cautious spending among consumers. \u201cBusiness confidence nonetheless remained strong, with service providers indicating that optimism was little changed from the post-referendum high recorded at the start of this year,\u201d it said. Simon Wells, chief European economist at HSBC, said: \u201cAgainst a backdrop of wage growth rising only slowly, the sharp rise in inflation resulting from the oil price rise and sterling depreciation over the past year or so is weighing on consumer finances and spending power. \u201cWith significant Brexit uncertainty still remaining, we do not expect a rise in investment will be able to compensate for slowing growth in the consumer sector,\u201d he added. Weaker order books contrasted with a buoyant picture in Europe and the rest of the world. Growth of eurozone economic output accelerated to a near-six-year high in February of 56.0, up from 54.4 in January, according to the Markit composite PMI.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of people on zero-hours contracts in the UK has hit a record high of 910,000 but there are signs the trend may have reached a peak after Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU, according to a leading thinktank. The figures for the final three months of 2016 represented a rise of more than 100,000, or 13%, compared with the same period in 2015, the Resolution Foundation said in its analysis of official data. People on zero-hours contracts are not guaranteed a minimum number of work hours but must be available. Such contracts are widely used by retailers, restaurants, leisure companies and hotels, and have been offered by companies including Sports Direct and McDonald\u2019s. Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite, urged the government to follow New Zealand\u2019s lead and ban zero-hour contracts. Len McCluskey, general secretary, said: \u201cThere are now close to 1 million people in the UK on zero-hours contracts. That\u2019s 1 million people with no job security, who are earning less than people in stable work and who, from week to week, do not know what they will have to live on. \u201cLet\u2019s learn from New Zealand \u2013 put workers\u2019 welfare first and outlaw these hire and fire contracts.\u201d Despite the numbers, Resolution said the \u201czero-hours juggernaut may have come to a halt\u201d, with the pace of growth slowing markedly in the second half of 2016, to 0.8% from 7.7% in the same period a year earlier. It was the first time growth in zero-hours was slower than overall employment growth across the economy, the thinktank said. \u201cWith the employment rate at a record high and the first inklings that firms may think the supply of labour from the EU could be limited after Brexit, employers may be finding it harder to fill roles without guaranteeing hours of work,\u201d Resolution said. Conor D\u2019Arcy, policy analyst at the foundation, said another possible reason for the slowdown in growth was reputational damage suffered by firms using zero-hours contracts. \u201cThe negative publicity these contracts have attracted may well have played a role in their slowdown, as firms rethink their use. Not providing guaranteed hours of work for those who want it, especially those in low-paying roles, can have a hugely negative impact on the living standards of workers and their families, as budgeting becomes near impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge now is to ensure that these still-popular contracts are reserved for cases of genuine desired flexibility for worker and employer.\u201d The thinktank said zero hours remained popular among some employers and workers. The analysis shows almost half of the net increase in people on such contracts in the past year was among workers aged 55-64. \u201cFor some of these workers, zero-hours contracts may offer a flexible transition from full-time work to retirement, allowing them to top up their income,\u201d Resolution said. Last year Theresa May hired Matthew Taylor, the former head of Tony Blair\u2019s policy unit, to head a review of workers\u2019 rights and practices, in an attempt to address concerns that millions are stuck in insecure and stressful work. Taylor is looking at the use of zero-hours contracts as part of his review, meeting workers and employers around the UK. \u201cThe government is determined to build an economy that works for everyone and that is why Matthew Taylor was asked to lead a review of modern employment practices,\u201d a spokesperson for the department of business, energy, and industrial strategy (BEIS) said, responding to Resolution\u2019s analysis of Office for National Statistics (ONS) data. The ONS will publish its own report on zero-hours numbers in the fourth quarter of 2016 on 15 March. Referring to a previous ONS release covering the second quarter of 2016, the BEIS spokesperson added: \u201cAccording to the latest published ONS statistics on the use of zero-hours contracts, fewer than 3% of the UK workforce classes itself as being on this type of contract in their main job, with almost 70% of those happy with the number of hours they work.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Sorrell: companies that offend good governance tend to perform better", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell has said that companies with dominant shareholders or owners such as Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox, Facebook and Snap that \u201coffend\u201d good corporate governance practices take more risks and tend to perform better financially. Sorrell was speaking the day after Snapchat parent Snap floated on Wall Street, with the offering oversubscribed and the share price rising more than 44% to $24 (\u00a319.5) on its first day of trading, despite co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy and early investors keeping total control of voting rights. He said that WPP has found over a decade of measuring brand valuations that when markets hit tough patches it is companies with dominant shareholders or owners that tend to continue to invest perform best. \u201cThe strongest innovators and strongest brands generate the strongest total shareholder returns,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps surprisingly, corporate structures that seem to offend customary good corporate governance may deliver better long-term results. \u201cControlled companies like the Murdochs\u2019 News Corp and Fox or the Roberts\u2019 Comcast or [Mark] Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook or [Sergey] Brin and [Larry] Page\u2019s Google or, now, [Evan] Spiegel\u2019s Snap may provide the confidence and stability needed to take the appropriate level of risk. Investing in innovation and strong brands yields enhanced returns.\u201d Sorrell made the comments as WPP, the world\u2019s largest marketing services group, said that it was lowering its growth forecast for this year below City expectations as advertisers remain jittery in the face of market uncertainty, following the election of Donald Trump as US president and the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. WPP hit its target of 3.1% net sales growth, the key metric watched by analysts and investors, but said a slow start to 2017 has seen that figure fall to 1.2%. Sorrell said that for 2017 net sales and revenues at around 2% growth. The City expected growth to be set at the 3% mark. Sorrell said that the 1% downgrade could largely be attributed to the loss of income after losing the AT&amp;T and VW advertising accounts. \u201cThe move from 3% organic growth outlook to 2%, in practice, does not have a huge impact on forecasts,\u201d said Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi. \u201cBut there is no hiding from the fact that a reversal of momentum is deeply unhelpful.\u201d Sorrell said that the Trump administration is more pro-business than Barack Obama\u2019s government, but that uncertainty remains in a number of markets. WPP has also been hit by a lower level of new business in the second half of 2016, which would have fuelled this year\u2019s figures. \u201cThe prospects in the UK are more mixed as the post-Brexit vote scenarios will play out over the next two years and uncertainties about the possible outcomes increase,\u201d he said. WPP blamed \u201cBrexit uncertainties\u201d for UK revenue growth turning negative in the final quarter last year (-0.6%), with all the company\u2019s other geographic areas reporting growth. Full year revenues in the UK grew 1.8%. \u201cThe four leading western continental European economies \u2013 Germany, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 let alone the Netherlands and Greece, also all face political uncertainty, although Germany and Spain are strengthening economically. In these circumstances, clients face challenging top-line growth opportunities and uncertainties.\u201d WPP reported total like-for-like revenue growth, stripping out factors such as currency effects and acquisitions, of 3% to \u00a314.4bn. Pre-tax profits rose 26.7% to \u00a31.89bn. Its shares plunged by almost 6% to 1,800p in early trading, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE100. Sorrell said that last year WPP spent $5bn (\u00a34.1bn) of its clients\u2019 advertising and marketing money with Google, its biggest single investment, and expects this to increase to $6bn in 2017. Murdoch\u2019s News Corp and Fox are WPP\u2019s second biggest investment, at $2.25bn, with spend expected to remain about the same. WPP spent about $1.7bn on Facebook last year, a figure which could increase to $2.5bn this year. The company spent just $90m on Snapchat last year.",

Investing in innovation and strong brands yields enhanced returns.\u201d </p> <p>Sorrell made the comments as WPP, the world\u2019s largest marketing services group, said that it was lowering its growth forecast for this year below City expectations as advertisers remain jittery in the face of market uncertainty, following the election of Donald Trump as US president and the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>WPP hit its target of 3.1% net sales growth, the key metric watched by analysts and investors, but said a slow start to 2017 has seen that figure fall to 1.2%.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sorrell said that for 2017 net sales and revenues at around 2% growth. The City expected growth to be set at the 3% mark. <br></p> <p>Sorrell said that the 1% downgrade could largely be attributed to the loss of income after losing the AT&amp;T and VW advertising accounts.</p> <p>\u201cThe move from 3% organic growth outlook to 2%, in practice, does not have a huge impact on forecasts,\u201d said Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi. \u201cBut there is no hiding from the fact that a reversal of momentum is deeply unhelpful.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrell said that the Trump administration is more pro-business than Barack Obama\u2019s government, but that uncertainty remains in a number of markets. WPP has also been hit by a lower level of new business in the second half of 2016, which would have fuelled this year\u2019s figures.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe prospects in the UK are more mixed as the post-Brexit vote scenarios will play out over the next two years and uncertainties about the possible outcomes increase,\u201d he said. </p> <p>WPP blamed \u201cBrexit uncertainties\u201d for UK revenue growth turning negative in the final quarter last year (-0.6%), with all the company\u2019s other geographic areas reporting growth. Full year revenues in the UK grew 1.8%.</p> <p>\u201cThe four leading western continental European economies \u2013 Germany, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 let alone the Netherlands and Greece, also all face political uncertainty, although Germany and Spain are strengthening economically. In these circumstances, clients face challenging top-line growth opportunities and uncertainties.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>WPP reported total like-for-like revenue growth, stripping out factors such as currency effects and acquisitions, of 3% to \u00a314.4bn. Pre-tax profits rose 26.7% to \u00a31.89bn.</p> <p>Its shares plunged by almost 6% to 1,800p in early trading, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE100.</p> <p>Sorrell said that last year WPP spent $5bn (\u00a34.1bn) of its clients\u2019 advertising and marketing money with Google, its biggest single investment, and expects this to increase to $6bn in 2017. <br></p> <p>Murdoch\u2019s News Corp and Fox are WPP\u2019s second biggest investment, at $2.25bn, with spend expected to remain about the same.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>WPP spent about $1.7bn on Facebook last year, a figure which could increase to $2.5bn this year. The company spent just $90m on Snapchat last year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anne Binding, owner of the Bake Store in Bridgend\u2019s covered market, summed up the mood in the town: grim. \u201cIt\u2019s sad for all those workers up there and for their families too but it\u2019s bad for the whole town. This is the last thing we needed.\u201d The news that the Ford\u2019s Bridgend engine plant, a provider of skilled, well-paid jobs in this corner of south Wales since the late 1970s, may shed more than 1,000 jobs over the next five years has been greeted with gloom, anger and recriminations. \u201cEveryone is affected,\u201d said Binding. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be selfish and think about me, but we do well out of Ford. If there\u2019s a birthday or another celebration they\u2019ll come in for our Welsh cakes. We\u2019re all going to suffer.\u201d Rebecca Upton on the fruit and vegetable stall opposite has first-hand experience of what it is like when a family member loses a job at Ford. Her husband, David, worked there on a temporary contract for a while before being told he was no longer required. \u201cIt was devastating. My husband didn\u2019t know what he was going to do. We had a really difficult time.\u201d He was lucky and managed to get another job down the road from Ford making artificial hips at Biomet. \u201cYou worry that those people losing their jobs at Ford may not be so lucky. These are very difficult times.\u201d It was then prime minister (and Cardiff MP) James Callaghan who persuaded Henry Ford II to locate the American giant\u2019s new engine manufacturing plant at the Waterton industrial estate between the M4 and Bridgend town centre. More than 20,000 people applied for jobs and 1,400 were taken on. The plant opened in 1980, since when thousands of people from Bridgend and further afield have helped build engines for Volvo, Land Rover and the niche luxury Morgan as well as Ford. One of the problems now is that Bridgend\u2019s expertise is in petrol engines in a world which may be moving towards other forms of power. There are 1,820 workers at the plant and Bridgend College runs successful courses in the automotive industry, ensuring a conveyor belt of young people with the skills to work at Ford and in the cluster of suppliers that has formed around it. The carmaker has helped push wages up. Average gross weekly pay here is \u00a3509 compared with \u00a3498 across Wales. \u201cFord has been a very good place to work over the years,\u201d one worker who has been there for more than 20 years told the Guardian. \u201cWorkers have traditionally been treated well and been proud to work for a famous company. The great thing for Bridgend is that they are highly skilled and decently paid jobs. If those jobs goes, the money goes from the area. \u201cI want others to have the same chances. Why should they be denied the chance to make a good, honest living?\u201d The Bridgend Ford workers are stung by the idea, contained in a leaked memo, that they are underperforming compared to other sites, including Dagenham in Essex. A second worker was scornful that the memo included the claim that overtime at Bridgend was double Dagenham\u2019s. \u201cWe don\u2019t demand overtime. The management asks us to do overtime to get the work done.\u201d The man, who has been at the plant for around a decade and is in his 30s, said he worried he would never find such a good job again if he lost his post at Ford. \u201cThis is another kick in the teeth for south Wales,\u201d he said. The proximity of the Port Talbot steelworks, just 14 miles down the road, makes the Ford crisis more poignant and politically sensitive. Last month Tata Steel UK workers voted in favour of measures designed to save jobs at Port Talbot and elsewhere by accepting cuts to pension benefits. Ford workers said they too were prepared to compromise to save jobs. \u201cWe can change our practices,\u201d said one. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it before and we\u2019ll do it again.\u201d Whether Brexit is involved in Ford\u2019s thinking over Bridgend is unclear. The union Unite puts the blame squarely on the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union. If so, there will be those who say the people of Bridgend have themselves to blame \u2013 almost 55% of them voted in favour of Brexit. Councillor Charles Smith, cabinet member for education and regeneration on Bridgend county borough council, said Brexit was certainly hovering in the background. He said losing Ford would be a \u201cbody blow\u201d to the area and called on Theresa May to do more. \u201cI suggest she disentangle herself from destroying the country through Brexit and austerity and help. Ford in Bridgend is nationally important.\u201d Ford made it clear that it had not announced any job losses. It has said that to attract new business the Bridgend operation \u201cwould need to ensure its competitiveness\u201d and addressing concerns relating to the plant\u2019s efficiency would be \u201chigh on the agenda\u201d. Former council leader Jeff Jones said it was about hard-nosed business decisions. \u201cThere will be some eastern European country offering Ford a greenfield site and cheap labour. When Ford ask about infrastructure, they\u2019ll say: \u2018No problems, we\u2019ll get an EU grant.\u2019 I\u2019ve worked for an American company \u2013 it\u2019s all about profit. That\u2019s what made America great.\u201d",
