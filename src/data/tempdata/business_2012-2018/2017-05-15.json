      "bodyText": "The new French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have broken with previous statements by saying they would be prepared to look at changing EU treaties in order to allow a further integration of the eurozone. Speaking at a joint press conference on Monday night during Macron\u2019s inaugural visit to Berlin on his first full day in office, Merkel said: \u201cFrom a German point of view, it is possible to change treaties if it makes sense in order to strengthen the eurozone.\u201d She said she was personally prepared to make the case for such a change. The comments will come as a painful blow to British politicians and diplomats such as David Cameron, whose calls for a reform to free movement were repeatedly rebuffed with the argument that treaty change under his proposed timetable was off the cards. The German chancellor said she been \u201cirked\u201d ever since the signing of the Lisbon treaty by those who had written off treaty change: \u201cThe entire world is changing and we declare that we have exhausted ourselves once and that\u2019s it for our entire lifetime,\u201d she said. Macron said \u201ctreaty change long used to be a French taboo\u201d, but that this would change now that he was president. \u201cFor us there are no such taboos,\u201d he said. Macron, who swept into Berlin with a new German-speaking prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, newly installed, reached for historic rhetoric in his speech, announcing that he would seek not just short-term results in tackling French unemployment, but nothing less than the \u201chistoric reconstruction of Europe and the eurozone\u201d. As the new French leader received military honours outside Merkel\u2019s chancellory, crowds outside the gate chanted his name. Behind closed doors, he is likely to have been exposed to a more familiar mantra about balanced budgets, debt reduction and German taxpayers\u2019 fears of being made to pay for bills left unpaid in other European states. But Macron had the advantage of arriving in the German capital as a familiar face. Between 2012 and 2014, he was closely involved in Franco-German discussions over how to create deeper economic integration in the core of the eurozone \u2013 plans which later stalled because of then-president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s domestic problems and more urgent diplomatic crises in eastern Ukraine. Macron will therefore be aware that making public demands from Berlin four months before a federal election is likely to backfire. After his meeting with Merkel, Macron stressed that he was not in favour of eurobonds \u2013 loans underwritten by all members of the eurozone, which some conservative German politicians have described as a vision of \u201chell\u201d for their voters. Instead, he stressed the need for investment. \u201cI will reform not because Europe asks for it, but because France needs it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not in favour of collectivising debts of the past. It leads to an irresponsible politics.\u201d Although Macron achieved a clear win over Marine Le Pen, the spectre of the Front National remains in the background, strengthening his hand as he hopes to open an historic window to revive some of these plans, such as an EU finance ministry, an EU budget for social issues and pan-European social insurance. His first appointments looked aimed at oiling the rusty Franco-German tandem: the new prime minister studied for his A-levels in Bonn and a former French ambassador in Berlin has been promoted to a close advisory role. While Merkel has often cast a sceptical eye on young men who sweep into office with rhetorical bravado, German media report her admiration for the manner in which Macron gained the presidency. Der Spiegel wrote that the German chancellor \u201crespects the toughness with which he has climbed his way to the top\u201d and sees more similarities between her and Macron\u2019s approach to Russia than that of failed conservative candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a more natural party ally of the German Christian Democrat. She may also remember his praise for her open-border policy at the height of the refugee crisis, which Macron said \u201csaved our collective dignity\u201d. Merkel\u2019s decisions in September 2015 has left the German chancellor more isolated and in need of allies in Europe than before. Even Germany\u2019s bull-headed finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, hinted over the weekend that his position on the new French president\u2019s plans for deeper eurozone integration was not as intransigent as reputation has it. Confronted with the suggestion that Germay should divert more of its budget surpluses to southern Europe, Sch\u00e4uble told news weekly Der Spiegel there was a need for transfers between wealthier and poorer EU states: \u201cA community cannot exist without the strong vouching for the weaker ones,\u201d he said. Sch\u00e4uble, famed as a fiscal hardliner in debt negotiations with Greece, said he thought \u201ca lot\u201d of Macron\u2019s call for the creation of a European finance minister role, adding that he himself had made a similar proposal in the past. However, the German conservative added that such a role would be pointless unless the finance ministry had its own budget and the authority to enforce Europe-wide spending rules. \u201cSuch a wide-reaching change requires changes to the European treaties,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said. \u201cAnd there are not many who believe this is realistic at the moment.\u201d Politicians on the German centre-left, especially foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, are trying to use the momentum of Macron\u2019s victory to revive many of the policy ideas originally developed in 2012 to 2014, when the new president was first an adviser and then economic minister in Hollande\u2019s government. In a policy paper called \u201c\u00c9lys\u00e9e 2.0\u201d, presented in Berlin last week, Gabriel pleads for the revival of the idea of a financial transaction tax \u2013 originally conceived by the two governments in 2013 \u2013 boosted with a Europe-wide corporate income tax, as well as transforming the European stability mechanism into a European investment fund similar to the IMF. The media may be harder to win over. In the German press, relief about Macron\u2019s victory has been quickly replaced with scepticism about the new president\u2019s reformist vision. \u201cExpensive friend: Emmanuel Macron saves Europe and Germany is meant to pay\u201d ran Der Spiegel\u2019s cover line. \u201cHow much is Macron going to cost us?,\u201d asked Bild. \u201cFrance isn\u2019t ailing because of the euro, because of Europe or even Germany\u201d, wrote the tabloid\u2019s opinion writer Nikolaus Blome. \u201cThe opposite is true: the euro, Europe and Germany are ailing because France has been standing still for years\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "US bank JP Morgan is buying a landmark office building in Dublin in a significant boost for the Irish capital as European cities compete to lure financial institutions away from London in the wake of the Brexit vote. The new premises will be able to house 1,000 staff \u2013 double the number of personnel the US bank currently employs in Dublin. The move is regarded as the first major expansion in Ireland by a financial services firm since the UK\u2019s referendum. The building is in the the flagship Capital Dock development in Dublin\u2019s docklands, which is due to be completed in the latter part of 2018. There has been speculation about the US bank\u2019s intentions of buying a Dublin building for weeks and earlier this month the bank included the Irish capital in its list of three main bases in the EU from which it will carry out the activities it used to perform in London. As the new office deal was announced Carin Bryans, the senior country officer for JP Morgan in Ireland, said: \u201cGiven the momentum of our local businesses, this new building gives us room to grow and some flexibility within the European Union. Dublin has the vibrant business and technology communities that suit a global firm like ours.\u201d The announcement coincided with a report in the Financial Times revealing that JP Morgan intends to hire more staff in Dublin for its custody operations, which look after the investments of major investors, hedge funds and big companies. James Kenny, JP Morgan\u2019s head of investor services, told the FT that the bank intended to hire a \u201csignificant\u201d number of staff in Dublin to expand the custody business. \u201cGrowth plans are driving our real estate plan,\u201d Kenny said. The office would also seem likely to allow the bank to make preparations for Brexit. JP Morgan has previously said it needs to be ready for a situation where there is not a deal over passporting \u2013 the means by which firms operate seamlessly across the EU \u2013 for the UK after Brexit. JP Morgan is being scrutinised because, in the run-up to the EU referendum last June, the bank\u2019s chief executive Jamie Dimon stood alongside the then chancellor, George Osborne, to warn that up to 4,000 roles could be lost. Last week, it warned it might have to move staff \u2013 possibly as many as 1,000 from the City of London \u2013 as a result of Brexit. It employs 16,000 people across the UK, with about 11,000 in the City and 4,000 in Bournemouth \u2013 it is the biggest private sector employer in Dorset \u2013 with the remainder in Scotland. Details are starting to emerge about Brexit plans after the Bank of England instructed major financial firms to put contingency plans in place and explain to Threadneedle Street by 14 July how they were preparing for \u201call eventualities\u201d. Other banks are also preparing to bulk up their businesses outside London, although it is thought that activities will fragment across the EU rather that settle in a single financial centre. Dublin is not just trying to attract banks. The Central Bank of Ireland has said it has received a \u201chigh level of interest\u201d from financial firms which carry out their European operations from the UK. It says it has received five applications relating to the insurance sector, had received signals that five other firms were going to apply and had been contacted by 20 others to discuss authorisation. But it is not the only capital mentioned by firms. Richard Gnodde, the head of European operations at Goldman Sachs, has said he would need more people in Madrid, Milan, Paris and other EU centres. Deutsche Bank has said that up to 4,000 jobs from its UK workforce of 9,000 could be moved to Frankfurt and other locations in the EU because of uncertainty about Britain\u2019s relationship with the remaining 27 countries in the EU. Standard Chartered, the London-headquartered emerging markets bank, has also picked Frankfurt for a new subsidiary. HSBC has said 1,000 roles will go to Paris. Lloyd\u2019s of London, the insurance market, is opening up in Brussels although some firms are playing down the impact on their business. Last week, Barclays said Brexit was \u201ca wholly manageable challenge\u201d and it would not need to shift British jobs or significant operations elsewhere.",

      "bodyText": "A surge in the oil price, a boost from China\u2019s $900bn infrastructure plans and a victory for Angela Merkel in a key German state election combined to push markets higher, despite the worries caused by the global cyber attack. But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: It\u2019s been another day of records for the FTSE100 and the German DAX, as they both put in new record highs, however the glacially slow progress above these new highs is a little worrying, which might suggest some investor nervousness at embarking on aggressive buying at such elevated levels. The sectors receiving a boost included oil and mining, while computer security stocks were also in demand after the cyber attack. Sophos jumped more than 7% while cybersecurity exchange-traded fund ISE rose more than 3%. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 18.98 points or 0.26% at 7454.37, having earlier reached a new all time peak of 7460 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.29% to a record close of 12,807.04 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.22% at 5417.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.6% to 21,704.46 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.56% at 10,957.8 In Athens, the Greek market slipped 0.86% to 782.32 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.39% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both hit new intra-day highs. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. News from Saudi Arabia and Russia that they favour extending the current oil production cuts until March 2018 is not a game changer but should help stabilise crude prices, according to Capital Economics. Its chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said: The first point to make is that this has not radically altered the outlook for oil prices. An extension of up to six months had already been widely anticipated, so this is simply a little longer than expected. That may be why oil prices rose by only about 3% today, whereas they rose by around 15% when the cuts were originally agreed at the end of November 2016. Brent crude remains comfortably within the $45 to $60pb range in which it has been trading since last November. Further ahead, we think the agreement will help to lift Brent crude prices towards our forecast of $60pb by year-end. Even allowing for compliance slipping a bit and US shale production continuing to exceed expectations, these cuts should be enough to rebalance the oil market and bring oil stocks down. Today\u2019s announcement also reinforces our view that oil prices will be far more stable in the coming years than they have been since 2014. Significant price rises would probably lead to weaker compliance by OPEC and Russia, as well as to higher shale production. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other big producers would probably extend their production cuts again if prices were to fall. As we have argued before, the current range for oil prices of around $45-60 per barrel is probably a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for the world economy. This is high enough to keep major producers afloat and to justify the recent rebound in investment in the energy sector. However, as it is well below the $100-plus level which appeared to be normal a few years ago, it is also comfortable for consumers. All told, the outlook for oil prices remains consistent with our forecasts for steady global growth and low inflation. The FTSE 100 is still heading for a record closing high, although it is currently off the day\u2019s best levels, but with a raft of UK economic data due this week, the question is whether the index can maintain its good run. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, sayd: The index hasn\u2019t quite been able to climb back to the 7460 all-time intraday high it hit soon after the bell; however, it is still lurking around the 7450 mark, keeping it on track to close at a new record peak. That\u2019s mainly thanks to its buoyant commodity sector; Brent Crude\u2019s 2.5% surge \u2013 with Putin throwing his backing behind the continuation of an oil-output cap \u2013 has obviously lifted the oil stocks, while the miners were pleased with the announcement of a $900 billion infrastructure spend in China. It is going to be interested to see if the FTSE can hold onto that growth tomorrow. The latest inflation figure is released on Tuesday morning and, with analysts expecting the reading to climb from 2.3% to 2.6% month-on-month, the pound could be in for a bit of a boost. Since Brexit that has tended to mean bad news for the UK index, though it is worth noting that cable has managed to keep its head above $1.29 without troubling the FTSE\u2019s record-breaking rise. More positive news from the US housing market. The National Association of Homebuilders\u2019 index has climbed to 70 in April, compared to the 68 level reached in March and expected to be repeated last month. US markets are also benefiting from the rise in oil prices, with investors shrugging off the worldwide cyber attack which began on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 62 points or 0.3% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened more than 0.1% better, with the latter at a new record high. Back with Greece, and credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has kept its stable outlook on the country\u2019s banks, citing the improved prospects for profitability. But it warned that problem loans remained high and were a severe challenge for Greek banks, although they should start declining from around 45% of gross loans at the end of 2016 over the next 12 to 18 months. Moody\u2019s added that it expected Greek banks to remain marginally profitable in 20179-2018, although the operating environment would remain challenging. Much depends on the government\u2019s ability to get funding from its creditors in a timely manner, said the agency. Time for a recap... Britain\u2019s stock market is on track for a new record closing high, after hitting its highest ever level in early trading. Having romped up to 7460 points shortly after 8am, the FTSE 100 has dropped back a little. It\u2019s currently nine points higher at 7444, above last Friday\u2019s record close. The rally is being driven by mining companies, which dominate the leaderboard today. Investors are anticipating higher demand for commodities as China presses on with its \u201cBelt and Road\u2019 strategy to build new infrastructure and transport links in Asia and beyond. The oil price continues to climb too, after Russia and Saudi Arabia announced they both supported extending a current agreement to curb crude output. Brent crude is now up 3% today, at $52.41 per barrel, after Vladimir Putin said this would help to stabilise prices. Chris Beauchamp of IG says that bullish traders were in the driving seat this morning, but also warns that a correction could be coming.... A new record high for the FTSE 100 this morning was driven in no small part by oil firms, which have been boosted by further talk among oil ministers that more production cuts will be necessary. What should worry FTSE bulls is that the index is exhibiting similar characteristics to the S&amp;P 500 \u2013 namely that the rally is being powered by smaller and smaller numbers of rising stocks each day; this doesn\u2019t mean a correction is around the corner, but it does raise the prospect of a reckoning that could be ugly. It\u2019s worth noting that only 40 members of the FTSE 100 have risen today, while 60 have fallen.... In Europe, optimism has been slightly dented by the news that Greece has been draged back into recession: And in the last few moments, Emmanuel Macron has named centre-right politician Eduard Philippe as his prime minister. Here\u2019s some instant reaction from Guardian colleagues.... And other experts: Newsflash from America: The factory sector of New York state has weakened this month, adding to a recent run of disappointing US data. The Empire State manufacturing index has dropped to minus 1, from 5.2 in April, dashing hopes of a rise to 7.0. It\u2019s the first negative reading since last October, and therefore the weakest report since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Companies in and around New York reported a drop in new orders, and a decline in employment growth too. The US stock market is tipped to rise slightly when trading begins, in 80 minutes. Holiday firm TUI has bucked today\u2019s trend, by falling 4% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Traders dumped TUI stock after the company reported subdued demand for holidays to Turkey and North Africa. Instead, tourists are plumping for Spain and Canaries, Greece, Cyprus, Cape Verde and Caribbean, apparently. TUI insisted that summer trading is \u201cin line with our expectations\u201d, with UK demand holding up despite the Brexit vote. But while revenues rose 4% in the last quarter, to nearly \u20ac3.1bn, pretax losses (on an EBITA basis) rose to \u20ac182.4m, from \u20ac138.1m a year ago. TUI also warned that the fall in the pound is driving up its costs, even though it hedged itself against the worst of the damage: Sterling remaining at rates significantly lower than those seen prior to last year\u2019s UK Brexit referendum. In line with TUI\u2019s hedging policy, the UK Source Market had already hedged a significant proportion of its foreign currency requirements ahead of the Brexit referendum, however on the unhedged portion this results in higher costs which will impact the UK business in the second half of the year. JP Morgan\u2019s army of City workers needn\u2019t pack their bags quite yet. But it does appear that the Wall Street bank is committed to moving jobs to Ireland, thanks to Brexit. JP Morgan announced this morning it has bought a new office block at Dublin\u2019s Capital Dock development. The site will hold 1,000 workers, which is twice its current workforce in the Irish capital. The company has previously said it will move jobs out of London, if (as seems likely) the UK loses its \u2018passporting rights\u2019 to within the EU. Here\u2019s the full story: Newsflash: Russian president Vladimir Putin has confirmed that Moscow is keen to extend the current deal to curb oil production by an extra nine months. Speaking in China, where he\u2019s been learning about the Silk Road plan, Putin told reporter that a longer production freeze, to March 2018, would ensure stable prices. Putin said: \u201cI have met with the heads of the companies ... and we support the proposal. In a wide-ranging discussion, Putin also denied that Russia was behind the WannnaCry cybercrime attack, called for a return to dialogue with North Korea, and insisted that Russia was right to miss the Eurovision Song Contest. Ukraine, he claimed, wasn\u2019t up to the job of hosting it..... Via Fidelity, here\u2019s a chart showing how Britain\u2019s stock market has performed under every prime minister since Ted Heath: It\u2019s no surprise that Margaret Thatcher delivered the biggest gains. Her sheer longevity (11 years) is one obvious factor. Stocks also rallied after the Big Bang of 1986 which revolutionised the City and shook up share trading. You might expect Tony Blair to be closer to Thatcher, given he governed for over a decade. However, the market fell sharply in 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst, and took years to recover those losses. Jim Callaghan gave investors the best annualised returns, at over 23% per year from 1976-1979. But that was also a time of rollicking inflation.... Gordon Brown\u2019s tenure, from 2007-2010, was the worst time to own shares. But that\u2019s due to the financial crisis which brought down Northern Rock and HBOS, and forced Royal Bank of Scotland into a taxpayer rescue too. No wonder investors suffered. But we shouldn\u2019t blithely assume that the Tories have some magic touch for the stock market, as Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, explains: \u201cWhile on the face of it the Conservatives appear to have delivered more impressive stock market returns than Labour in recent years, the economic and market environment has a far more important bearing on the performance of the stock market than who the current occupant of Number 10 is. \u201cFor example, while UK stocks rose by over 500 per cent under Margaret Thatcher (which some have credited to her decision to deregulate the financial markets), stocks across the globe enjoyed similar returns. Similarly, while the markets produced a negative return under Gordon Brown, this was a reflection of the financial crisis rather than Labour party policy. The oil price is continuing to climb, helping to keep the FTSE 100 at record highs. The prospect of Opec extending its production curbs, combined with optimism over China\u2019s Silk Road plans, have pushed Brent crude up by 2.5% to $52.10 per barrel. That\u2019s good news for BP, whose shares are now up 1.3%. But it\u2019s potentially bad news for companies and individuals, as it implies that petrol prices on the forecourt will go up. This would intensify the looming wage squeeze in the UK, with inflation already expected to rise faster than earnings this year... Bad news from Greece... the country\u2019s economy has suffered another contraction. Greek GDP shrank by 0.1% in the first three months of this year, following a 1.2% plunge in October-December. That puts Greece back into recession, in a reminder of its fragile economic state after years of austerity and political upheaval. Later this week, MPs will vote on further spending cuts and tax reforms in return for another tranche of loans. Chinese president Xi\u2019s ambitious infrastructure plans are driving shares higher around the globe, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. As mentioned earlier, China has been proudly outlining its plans for new land and sea connections with the rest of the world. It aims to spend hundreds of billions of dollars improving ports, roads and rail links in Europe and Africa, to spruce up old trade routes and create new ones. Brooks says: The big news over the weekend was a Chinese government summit that announced the new \u201cSilk Road\u201d project, which aims to forge peace, inclusiveness and free trade across the world. China has pledged $124bn in infrastructure spending to bring this into action, and markets are cheering Chinese largesse, with Brent crude rising $1 on the back of this news at the start of the week. China\u2019s spending pledge has underpinned risk sentiment more generally this morning, with European equities opening higher and US futures pointing to a stronger open on Wall Street. More details here: The FTSE 100 is being boosted by Saudi Arabia and Russia\u2019s commitment to extending their current deal on oil output curbs, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: The FTSE is (oil) barrelling towards a fresh all-time high this Monday, ignoring both the \u2018WannaCry\u2019 ransomware attack of last Friday, and a selection of weak Chinese data that saw industrial production drop from 7.6% to 6.5% month-on-month. Rising 25 points to lurk just above 7450, the UK index is already at a new peak \u2013 now it just needs to stay there. The main thrust of the FTSE\u2019s growth is coming from the commodity sector, itself led by Brent Crude\u2019s recovery. The black stuff surged 2% after the bell \u2013 and now sits just under $52 per barrel \u2013 having been lifted by reports that both Saudi Arabia and Russia are willing to support an extension of the current output-capping agreement. Traders have been rushing to buy shares in cybersecurity companies following the WannaCry ransomware outbreak that struck Britain\u2019s NHS on Friday, and companies and users across the globe. Shares in Sophos, which sells antivirus, encryption and network security products, have jumped 7% to an all-time high. Other security firms are also in demand, as Reuters reports: Cybersecurity stocks and tracker products rose at the European open on Monday after a global \u201cransomware\u201d attack disrupted car factories, hospitals, shops and schools around the world. A London-listed cybersecurity exchange-traded fund ISE whose holdings include software provider Cisco Systems and cybersecurity firms Fireeye and Symantec rose 0.9 percent at the open. Our liveblog is tracking the latest developments: Update: The FTSE 100 has nudged a new all-time intraday high of 7460 points. That puts the index of top UK -listed companies firmly on track for a new closing high at 4.30pm as well. Smaller companies are also in demand this morning; The FTSE small cap index has also hit an all-time high this morning. Anyone who bought British shares the day after the EU referendum is sitting on a very large profit. Today\u2019s rally means the FTSE 100 has now gained 20% since the close of play on June 24th, when closed at 6138 points. Anyone who had the nerve to buy shares then, after a day of wild losses, has done pretty well. This chart from the FT shows how the Footsie rapidly shook off its initial panic over the Brexit vote, and has risen steadily since. However... the FTSE 100\u2019s rise is partly due to the slump in sterling after the referendum. This has pumped up the value of money earned abroad by multinationals listed in London, and also made UK companies more attractive to foreign predators. Germany\u2019s stock market is also on a tear this morning, hitting its own all-time high. The DAX index of top German companies has gained almost 0.5% this morning, extending its recent rally. German shares have been in demand in recent weeks, as fears of a populist surge in Europe have faded. The amount of money flowing into European equities hit a record high last week, on relief that Emmanuel Macron had won the French presidency. China\u2019s ambitious economic plans appear to be driving the London stock market to today\u2019s record high. Over the weekend, Chinese president Xi Jinping launched a summit to promote the \u201c\u2018Belt and Road\u2019 -- a $900bn infrastructure mega-project. Xi\u2019s vision is a global construction spree covering 65 countries, from Asia to the Americas via Africa and Europe. And that is likely to drive up consumption of iron ore, copper, nickel -- which is why mining stocks are in demand this morning. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Metals prices are advancing, helped by optimism about China\u2019s \u201cone Belt, one Road\u201d program. Boom! The FTSE 100 has hit a new all-time record high at the start of trading in London. Britain\u2019s blue-chip index has gained 23 points to 7458, as energy producers and natural resource stocks rally. The rally pushes the FTSE 100 over its previous all-time intraday high of 7447, which it hit on the 17th March this year. Mining giants like Glencore, BHP Billiton, and Antofagasta are all dominating the risers. Royal Dutch Shell is also in demand, following the rise in the oil price. Reaction to follow! This chart from Bloomberg shows how the oil price jumped this morning, following the Saudi-Russia announcement: The oil price has jumped this morning, after Saudi Arabia and Russia signalled their support for a new deal to cut production levels. Brent crude - oil sourced from the North Sea - has jumped by 1.5% to $51.62 per barrel. US crude oil is also gaining. The move came after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and Russian energy minister Alexander Novak announced that they believe a current deal to cut crude supplies should be extended until the end of March 2018. In a statement, they said: \u201cWe\u2019ve come to conclusion that the agreement needs to be extended. \u201cThe two ministers agreed to do whatever it takes to achieve the desired goal of stabilizing the market and reducing commercial oil inventories to their 5-year average level.\u201d This raises the chances that Opec\u2019s current supply cut deal, which runs out in June, should be extended. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After hitting a record closing high on Friday, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 may hit a new all-time peak when trading begins today. Markets in Asia have already rallied, as traders shake off the shock of the WannaCry malware attack and a smaller-than-expected rise in US retail sales on Friday. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan has hit its highest level since June 2015, up 0.3%. Emerging markets have also posted gains. Reuters reports that: Resilient Asian stocks edged up to a two-year high on Monday, shaking off threats from by a ransomware attack that locked some 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries at the weekend, a missile test by North Korea, and weak U.S. data. European financial markets are expected to open higher, helped by optimism over Europe\u2019s economy. Speculation that oil producers might extend their supply curbs could also push the market higher. So the FTSE 100, which close at 7435 on Friday night, could make a run at the all-time intraday high of 7447 set in March. The news that Angela Merkel has won a key state election overnight could also please investors. Merkel\u2019s CDU party beat the Social Democrats in North Rhine-Westphalia by a comfortable margin, suggesting she\u2019s on track to win another term as German chancellor this autumn. CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson says: The German Chancellor who only decided to run again for a historic fourth term quite late on in the German elections later this year will be feeling quite happy having seen off her rivals at the SPD, and the challenge of their new leader Martin Schulz in state elections at the weekend, in North Rhine-Westphalia. There\u2019s not much in the economic diary, apart from Greek GDP for the first quarter of 2017 at 10am BST. In the City, holiday firm TUI is reporting its half-year results. We\u2019ll be tracking all the news through the day...",

Its chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first point to make is that this has not radically altered the outlook for oil prices. An extension of up to six months had already been widely anticipated, so this is simply a little longer than expected. That may be why oil prices rose by only about 3% today, whereas they rose by around 15% when the cuts were originally agreed at the end of November 2016. Brent crude remains comfortably within the $45 to $60pb range in which it has been trading since last November.</p> <p>Further ahead, we think the agreement will help to lift Brent crude prices towards our forecast of $60pb by year-end. Even allowing for compliance slipping a bit and US shale production continuing to exceed expectations, these cuts should be enough to rebalance the oil market and bring oil stocks down.</p> <p> Today\u2019s announcement also reinforces our view that oil prices will be far more stable in the coming years than they have been since 2014. Significant price rises would probably lead to weaker compliance by OPEC and Russia, as well as to higher shale production. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other big producers would probably extend their production cuts again if prices were to fall.</p> <p>As we have argued before, the current range for oil prices of around $45-60 per barrel is probably a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for the world economy. This is high enough to keep major producers afloat and to justify the recent rebound in investment in the energy sector. However, as it is well below the $100-plus level which appeared to be normal a few years ago, it is also comfortable for consumers. All told, the outlook for oil prices remains consistent with our forecasts for steady global growth and low inflation. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5919bbf3e4b0f5ae171e24da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-15T14:34:20.026Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 is still heading for a record closing high, although it is currently off the day\u2019s best levels, but with a raft of UK economic data due this week, the question is whether the index can maintain its good run. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, sayd:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The index hasn\u2019t quite been able to climb back to the 7460 all-time intraday high it hit soon after the bell; however, it is still lurking around the 7450 mark, keeping it on track to close at a new record peak. That\u2019s mainly thanks to its buoyant commodity sector; Brent Crude\u2019s 2.5% surge \u2013 with Putin throwing his backing behind the continuation of an oil-output cap \u2013 has obviously lifted the oil stocks, while the miners were pleased with the announcement of a $900 billion infrastructure spend in China.</p> <p>It is going to be interested to see if the FTSE can hold onto that growth tomorrow. The latest inflation figure is released on Tuesday morning and, with analysts expecting the reading to climb from 2.3% to 2.6% month-on-month, the pound could be in for a bit of a boost. Since Brexit that has tended to mean bad news for the UK index, though it is worth noting that cable has managed to keep its head above $1.29 without troubling the FTSE\u2019s record-breaking rise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5919b355e4b0762dda0bb1af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-15T14:15:09.335Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More positive news from the US housing market.</p> <p>The National Association of Homebuilders\u2019 index has climbed to 70 in April, compared to the 68 level reached in March and expected to be repeated last month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/calculatedrisk/status/864122857797828610\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NAHB: Builder Confidence increased to 70 in May <a href=\"https://t.co/FqClWotZMs\">https://t.co/FqClWotZMs</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/E38IAgsALs\">pic.twitter.com/E38IAgsALs</a></p>&mdash; Bill McBride (@calculatedrisk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/calculatedrisk/status/864122857797828610\">May 15, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-05-15T14:19:49.467Z\">at 3.19pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5919ae91e4b0f5ae171e249a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-15T13:38:15.865Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets are also benefiting from the rise in oil prices, with investors shrugging off the worldwide cyber attack which began on Friday.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 62 points or 0.3% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened more than 0.1% better, with the latter at a new record high.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5919a86ce4b0f5ae171e2471\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-15T13:17:55.806Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Moody's keeps stable outlook on Greek banks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Greece, and <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-maintains-stable-outlook-on-the-Greek-banking-system-amid--PR_366708\">credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has kept its stable outlook on the country\u2019s banks,</a> citing the improved prospects for profitability.</p> <p>But it warned that problem loans remained high and were a severe challenge for Greek banks, although they should start declining from around 45% of gross loans at the end of 2016 over the next 12 to 18 months.</p> <p>Moody\u2019s added that it expected Greek banks to remain marginally profitable in 20179-2018, although the operating environment would remain challenging.

Her sheer longevity (11 years) is one obvious factor.

However, the market fell sharply in 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst, and took years to recover those losses.</p> <p>Jim Callaghan gave investors the best annualised returns, at over 23% per year from 1976-1979. But that was also a time of rollicking inflation....</p> <p>Gordon Brown\u2019s tenure, from 2007-2010, was the worst time to own shares. But that\u2019s due to the financial crisis which brought down Northern Rock and HBOS, and forced Royal Bank of Scotland into a taxpayer rescue too. No wonder investors suffered.</p> <p>But we shouldn\u2019t blithely assume that the Tories have some magic touch for the stock market, as <strong>Tom Stevenson,</strong> investment director for personal investing at <strong>Fidelity International, explains:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cWhile on the face of it the Conservatives appear to have delivered more impressive stock market returns than Labour in recent years, the economic and market environment has a far more important bearing on the performance of the stock market than who the current occupant of Number 10 is.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, while UK stocks rose by over 500 per cent under Margaret Thatcher (which some have credited to her decision to deregulate the financial markets), stocks across the globe enjoyed similar returns.

The UK-based firm suffered a rare and humiliating shareholder rebellion last year when chief executive Bob Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m pay package was voted down, against the backdrop of record company losses. Another uprising is unlikely at the AGM on Wednesday, when investors will be asked to approve the \u00a39m salary for Dudley in 2016 \u2013 40% lower than in 2015 \u2013 as higher oil prices pushed the company back into profit. However, for the first time in three years, shareholders will also decide on a binding new pay policy for 2017-20, which would lead to a \u00a32.9m cut in Dudley\u2019s maximum payout. Campaigners are encouraging investors to vote against the policy on the grounds that company strategy appears \u201cmisaligned\u201d with the Paris climate deal\u2019s goal of avoiding dangerous global warming. ShareAction acknowledged BP was doing better than rival Shell on removing oil and gas volume production targets from its pay policy, but said BP\u2019s corporate strategy was failing to adapt the firm for a lower carbon world. The group added that a green light would lock in a pay policy at a \u201ccritical\u201d time for addressing climate change, as 2020 is seen as the last year by which carbon emissions must peak for the world to be likely to keep temperature rises below 2C. The Church of England, which has BP in the top holdings of its \u00a39bn funds, said it would be voting against both Dudley\u2019s pay and the remuneration policy. \u201cWe\u2019ve noted this year that there has been some improvement on executive remuneration. That said, it is still an extremely large award when you look at the whole package and compared to peers so we obviously remained concerned,\u201d said Adam Matthews, head of engagement for the church commissioners. But with just 50% of shareholders needed to approve the remuneration policy, it is unlikely to be derailed. The three big proxy shareholder advisory services \u2013 Glass Lewis, ISS and IVIS \u2013 have recommended a vote in favour or have no concerns with the policy, the first time all three have been supportive for several years. Separately, the authoritative Carbon Disclosure Project placed Shell one spot above BP at four out of 10 in a new league table of how oil and gas companies have responded to investor concerns on climate change. The group called Shell\u2019s link between remuneration and carbon emissions a \u201clandmark\u201d, and noted that BP had no equivalent measure. Anglo-Dutch rival Shell\u2019s AGM, which takes place on 23 May, will also have its remuneration and climate change policies scrutinised.",

The company\u2019s shares have lost about 30% of their value in the past 12 months, while fresh news from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) last week suggested that the UK housing market is continuing to slow down, with falling property sales and \u201cstagnant\u201d buyer demand contributing to one of the most downbeat reports since the financial crash. Oh \u2013 and obviously there is also the chance of a row with shareholders over executive pay. So will anybody take any notice of Foxtons\u2019s excuses for its list of current challenges? Possibly \u2013 although sympathisers may be less numerous than its collection of Twitter followers. Package of trouble at Royal Mail This week, Royal Mail Group is promising to release its annual results \u2013 although we\u2019d all be wise to wait and see if it follows through with that pledge. The company is fast developing a reputation for not always sticking exactly to its word. You will recall how there is currently an almighty row between the company and some staff about efforts to wriggle out of a defined benefit pension scheme \u2013 which pays out to employees based on years of service with either a career average or final salary. They are nice pensions to have, but are now supposedly unaffordable, unless, as one City wag puts it, scores of workers do the collegiate thing and die more quickly. All of which explains why Royal Mail stopped new staff joining the scheme nine years ago. Anyway, the company is now trying to cut the benefits to its employees who were already enrolled in the scheme, hence the threat of industrial action. As any A-level business student will tell you, pensions are wages deferred and if Royal Mail does not deliver, it\u2019s conceptually no different from cutting salaries. Expect that point to be made with the release of this week\u2019s annual results \u2013 assuming Royal Mail doesn\u2019t try to sidestep that too. Black horse rides off to private sector Just as the concept of state-owned industries is thrust back into the news agenda with the drafting of the Labour manifesto, there comes a potentially symbolic moment when the UK government finally withdraws from one of its most infamous investments. The government\u2019s investment holding company, UKFI, has been selling down its once-43% stake in Lloyds Banking Group for months. We have now got to the point where, we are so insignificant on the share register that dashing boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio might treat us as he does members of the paparazzi while on a foreign business trip \u2013 and not even notice we\u2019re hanging around. Anyway, this week is expected to be the moment when our now 0.25% holding finally goes to zero, so expect crowing by the Conservative party about how Lloyds has been nursed back into the private sector on its watch (and, possibly, Horta-Os\u00f3rio saying he\u2019s off). Apparently we have all made around \u00a3500m out of owning a stake in the bank \u2013 which sounds quite good, although that might be misleading. Last week the Financial Times worked out that if we had we stuck our \u00a320.3bn stake into Lloyds\u2019 highest-paying instant access account, we\u2019d have scooped \u00a32.9bn in interest.
