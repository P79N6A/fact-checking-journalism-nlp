      "bodyText": "The widening discrepancy between shopfloor wages and soaring boardroom pay is rising up the agenda of major investors and could spark calls for companies to provide more detail about their pay ratios, according to one of the largest fund management groups in the City. Legal &amp; General Investment Management\u2019s annual corporate governance report predicted that pay ratios \u2013 the chief executive\u2019s pay relative to the average employee \u2013 would be a \u201chot topic\u201d in 2016. The US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, is expected to require publication of such information from next year. \u201cThis is going to put a lot more pressure on companies everywhere,\u201d said Sacha Sadan, LGIM\u2019s director of corporate governance, in the report. \u201cThis is becoming a political and social issue and will creep into the governance world. Frankly we don\u2019t know what the ratio should be, but I think it is going to be an emerging issue and more transparency will occur in this area,\u201d he said. The fund management arm of insurer L&amp;G released its report into last year\u2019s annual general meeting season just as 2016\u2019s is getting under way. This year shareholders have already voted against pay deals at two FTSE 100 companies \u2013 BP and Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 while at mining company Anglo American, 40% of investors voted against pay. The focus is turning to this week\u2019s AGM of Shire Pharmaceuticals for a vote over a 25% salary rise, to \u00a315m, for its chief executive Flemming Ornskov. Advertising company WPP is also preparing to publish its annual report, which is expected to show a pay deal of around \u00a370m for its chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. Next month Rakesh Kapoor, the boss of Cillit Bang maker Reckitt Benckiser, is due to have his \u00a323m pay package rejected by at least some shareholder groups. Shareholders are expected to question Barclays about the decision of the new chief executive, Jes Staley, to cut the dividend. The High Pay Centre said Kapoor\u2019s pay rise amounted to more than \u00a310m from 2014 while Ornskov was getting a \u00a312m boost. The last annual wages figures for the year to April 2015 show workers\u2019 median pay for full-time employees was \u00a327,600, an increase of 1.6% from the previous year. Average wages have crept up since then, but the most recent annual rise of 1.8%, including bonus payments, falls well short of the UK\u2019s rocketing executive pay. Publishing its voting record for last year\u2019s AGM season, LGIM said that out of the 188 resolutions it had voted against in 2015, 93 were on pay. But Sadan said LGIM was not just focusing on pay. \u201cDespite remuneration still being a key concern, I believe that corporate governance has evolved from just voting on pay related issues. Our report shows the issues on which we engage with companies ranges widely from climate change to cyber-security and continues to evolve,\u201d he said. He also pointed to boardroom diversity. In 2013, L&amp;G had warned FTSE 100 companies it would vote against their chairman if they had all male boards after the 2015 target set by Lord Davies for 25% female representation. Despite the overall target for the FTSE 100 having been met, LGIM pointed out that 42 companies have less than 25% women on their boards. In its report of how it voted in 2015, LGIM provided the example of FTSE 250 company biotech Genus which had an all male board, prompting it to vote against the chairman. The report provides other examples of where it held discussions with companies, including bookmaker Ladbrokes and at banking group Standard Chartered. At Sports Direct, the retailer at which the Guardian shed light on working practices, LGIM said it had voted against the re-election of the chairman two years running. Among other issues highlighted by LGIM was food waste at retailers and corporate tax. \u201cThere is a lot of confusion around corporate tax policies and the role companies play in contributing to society,\u201d Sadan said in the report. \u201cWe would like to see better public disclosure of tax policies so investors can better assess the potential risks.\u201d He added that LGIM was working with companies to understand how climate change would impact their businesses. \u201cDisclosure will be key \u2013 companies will need to make clear how they will operate in a world where the increase in global average temperatures is attempted to be helped at 2C,\u201d the report said.",

      "bodyText": "The number of billionaires living in Britain has risen at its slowest pace since the financial crisis after some of the country\u2019s richest people saw their fortunes plummet over the past year. Those who built their wealth on commodities such as oil and steel suffered multi-billion pound falls as rock-bottom prices ate into their personal assets. But there were big rises for property tycoons, including the latest table-toppers, the Reuben brothers, while the list was gatecrashed by new entrants such as Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton and Sacha Baron-Cohen, the comedian and actor behind Ali G and Borat. Sibling property investors David and Simon Reuben, who made their first fortune purchasing Russian aluminium before buying up large tracts of London\u2019s landmark buildings, reached the summit of the annual Sunday Times rich list of Britain\u2019s 1,000 wealthiest people with a combined fortune of \u00a313.1bn, after climbing four places in a year. Sri and Gopi Hinduja \u2013 also brothers \u2013 finished a close second with \u00a313bn, leapfrogging last year\u2019s richest man, the Warner Music Group owner, Len Blavatnik. The tycoon, born in Odessa, Ukraine, fell two places to third as his wealth slumped by \u00a31.6bn to \u00a311.6bn. While the combined worth of Britain\u2019s billionaires grew by nearly 6% to \u00a3344bn, Blavatnik\u2019s fate was mirrored by a host of ultra-wealthy business people. Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and family, who in 2008 boasted a \u00a327.7bn fortune that outstripped any in British history, saw his wealth decline by \u00a32bn last year to \u00a37.1bn. Mittal\u2019s wealth was affected by the ongoing crisis in the steel industry, which has claimed more than 5,000 jobs in Britain alone over the past year. The Chelsea FC owner, Roman Abramovich, who made his fortune through his Russian oil business Sibneft, witnessed his worth fall by \u00a3890m to \u00a36.4bn. The Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner, Mike Ashley, who has been rocked by a Guardian investigation into working conditions in his retail empire, was among the biggest losers, as his personal pot shrank by \u00a31.1bn to \u00a32.4bn. Fellow retail tycoon Sir Philip Green suffered a \u00a3280m decline to \u00a33.2bn after a year in which he sold the BHS high street chain for \u00a31, only to watch it plummet towards an administration process likely to begin on Monday. The single biggest loss of wealth affected Carrie and Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo and family, whose value is built on Franco-British oil firm Perenco. Their combined assets tumbled \u00a32.45bn to \u00a33.35bn amid persistently low oil prices. Hefty losses among some of Britain\u2019s richest people meant that the number of billionaires in the UK increased by just three to 120, the slowest rate of growth since the financial crisis, when their ranks dwindled from 75 to 43 in 2009. And while London remains the world\u2019s preferred playground for billionaires, boasting more than any other city, there were three fewer than last year at 77. The annual list of Britain\u2019s ultra-wealthy also boasted some spectacular rises, such as that of Sir James Dyson, the inventor famed for his bagless vacuum cleaner, among other creations. His household goods and technology business reported profits of \u00a3448m last year, with salaries and dividends boosting the Dyson family\u2019s wealth by \u00a31.5bn to \u00a35bn. Perhaps the most remarkable rise was staged by the little-known brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who were leasing a single dilapidated garage in Bury just 15 years ago. The pair have since built an empire worth \u00a3700m by buying and renovating service stations to create a 341-strong chain of Euro Garages. They soared 473 places to 164th as their fortune increased by \u00a3550m to \u00a3700m. Britain\u2019s richest woman is Kirsty Bertarelli, the former Miss UK and would-be pop star who, with her husband, the pharmaceutical billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli, has a combined worth \u00a39.8bn, making them the richest husband and wife team. The wealthiest self-made businesswoman in the UK is Denise Coates, who built the Bet365 business with her family, amassing a combined worth of nearly \u00a33.8bn. The Queen, who celebrated her 90th birthday last week, saw her wealth remain flat at \u00a3340m but dropped 17 places in the list to equal 319th. The sum puts her on level pegging with the entertainment mogul Simon Cowell, the man behind The X Factor and Britain\u2019s Got Talent. New entries included Baron-Cohen, who made his name with his Ali G character and this year released Grimsby, his first film in a decade. Together with his wife, the former soap opera star Isla Fisher, the 44-year-old is worth \u00a3105m, putting him 936th in Britain. Lewis Hamilton was another new entry and Britain\u2019s richest sportsman with a fortune of \u00a3106m. Pop star Adele saw her personal worth soar by \u00a335m to \u00a385m, while there was no surprise that the wealthiest band were One Direction, worth a combined \u00a3132m. Overall, the 1,000 wealthiest people in Britain are worth a combined \u00a3576bn, an increase of \u00a328.5bn on last year, which equality campaigners said amounted to an increase of \u00a3901 every second. The Equality Trust pointed out that the wealth of the richest 1,000 was the same as that owned by the poorest 40% in the UK. They said the increase in the worth of rich list members could have paid for everyone in Britain\u2019s council tax, a year\u2019s rent for 3m households or 1.8m jobs on the living wage. \u201cThe level of inequality in the UK is both completely unjustifiable and hugely damaging for society,\u201d said John Hood, acting director. \u201cA wealth of evidence now shows us that living in a more unequal country means you\u2019re more likely to suffer from poor mental and physical health, have poorer education, trust people less, be the victim of violent crime and even die earlier. It\u2019s not good enough for politicians to repeatedly fail to act on this.\u201d Many of the rich list members chose to use their wealth to fund the Conservative party, with only eight out of the top 50 political donors spurning the Tories. But the Conservatives were denied the two biggest political donations, with the media mogul Richard Desmond handing \u00a31m to Ukip and EuroMillions lottery winners Colin and Chris Weir giving \u00a31m of their \u00a3153m winnings to the Scottish National party during the year.

Emmanuel Macron\u2019s comments come a week after he said EDF would deliver its verdict on Hinkley Point, which is set to meet 7% of the UK\u2019s energy needs, in \u201cthe coming week or month\u201d. EDF said just days ago that it was expecting to make a final decision in the summer, having previously promised to do so by the time of its annual general meeting on 12 May. The fresh delay raises the prospect that even if the project does go ahead, it will not meet its scheduled completion date of 2025, already eight years later than originally planned. Macron told a French newspaper that three conditions must be in place before EDF, which is 85% government-owned, could proceed with building two reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset. He cited an improvement in EDF\u2019s financial position, consultation with French trade unions and unspecified measures to ensure construction goes according to plan. \u201cThe final investment decision could be confirmed next September,\u201d he said. Hinkley Point has proved controversial in the UK. There have been allegations that the project is too expensive and fears that a series of delays suffered on similar EDF nuclear projects in France and Finland could be replicated. EDF has also faced opposition from French trade union officials who say the project threatens the company\u2019s financial stability. It has since approved a \u00a33.1bn capital injection funded partly by the state, in a bid to shore up its finances ahead of the Hinkley decision. The fresh delay is likely to fuel criticism of the project from organisations such as Greenpeace, which last week said the project was an \u201cutter mess\u201d. Greenpeace\u2019s director, John Sauven, responded to EDF\u2019s previous announcement that a decision would not come until the summer by cautioning that the project was doomed. \u201cThis may now be the sign that the entire project is coming to a grinding halt and the UK government urgently needs to back renewable energy as a more reliable alternative,\u201d he said.",

The collapse of the department store chain will be the biggest failure on the high street since the demise of Woolworths in 2008, providing the government with another headache as it attempts to save thousands of jobs in the steel industry. BHS has failed to secure emergency funding that it needed to pay wages and its rent. The restructuring firm Duff &amp; Phelps is set to be appointed as administrators on Monday, unless \u00a360m can be found to keep BHS afloat in the short term. Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS, said: \u201cWhat was on the table wasn\u2019t sufficient and we have been working in the last few days to fill the gap.\u201d Dominic Chappell, the owner of BHS, held talks all weekend with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct about the sportswear retailer buying the ailing department store chain. However, Sports Direct is thought to be concerned about BHS\u2019s debts and its pension deficit. In the absence of a rescue deal, BHS staff will be told about the collapse of the company at a meeting at 11am on Monday morning. The administrators will try to find a buyer for the company as a going concern. The collapse of BHS will lead to criticism of Chappell and Sir Philip Green, the billionaire tycoon who sold the business for \u00a31 in last March 2015 Usdaw, the trade union for shopworkers, said it was very concerned for the future of BHS, which has 164 stores. David Gill, the Usdaw national officer, said: \u201cWe are seeking urgent clarification from the company and urging them to change their attitude to trade unions and begin a dialogue with us at this difficult and worrying time for staff.\u201d The demise of BHS comes just a month after it appeared to secure its short-term survival by persuading landlords to cut the rent it pays by up to 75% at 87 shops. However, even as landlords, suppliers and creditors voted overwhelmingly in favour of the survival plan, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), BHS warned that it need to find \u00a3100m to continue trading. The chain was founded as British Home Stores in 1928 by a group of American entrepreneurs who wanted to create a UK version of Woolworths. The first shop was in Brixton, south London. Green, the retail tycoon, bought BHS for \u00a3200m in 2000, turning it into part of his Arcadia empire. Green paid more than \u00a3400m in dividends to his wife, Tina, during the early years of his 15-year ownership, but he struggled to revive the brand amid fierce competition on the high street and it remained deep in the red. The billionaire sold BHS last March, for just \u00a31, to Retail Acquisitions Ltd, a little-known collection of financiers, lawyers and accountants led by Chappell. Since then, concerns about its future have grown. It emerged that Chappell had been declared bankrupt twice before buying BHS and the Guardian revealed that Retail Acquisitions had taken an \u00a38.4m loan out of BHS in the days after it bought the business. Retail Acquisitions claimed the loan was for \u201cprofessional fees\u201d, although more than a third went to members of the consortium. It is understood that the relationship between Chappell and the management of BHS and Green has broken down in recent weeks. Green is a major creditor to BHS after lending the retailer money when he sold it. The \u00a3100m that BHS needed to raise was supposed to come from the sale of \u00a330m of property, a new \u00a360m loan from private equity firm Gordon Brothers and \u00a310m from the changing the terms of its agreement with suppliers. On top of this, however, it needed to raise another \u00a370m from selling property to pay off a separate loan from Grovepoint. This would allow it to sell property secured against the Grovepoint loan. However, the retailer has failed to raise enough money from its property and the deal with Gordon Brothers has fallen apart. BHS raised just \u00a352m from the sale of its shop on Oxford Street in London and a branch in Sunderland, leaving it well short of its funding target. It had hoped to raise \u00a370m from selling Oxford Street and the rest of the money by selling eight shops to Sports Direct. With the business running out of cash, Gordon Brothers is understood to have offered strict terms on a loan, including upfront fees and less money than initially hoped. Talks with Gordon Brothers were already complex because Green needed to release security he held over BHS\u2019s assets in order for the loan to go through. Green is understood to have been ready to agree to the loan, but the funds from Gordon Brothers were not enough without the property deals and the strict terms led to the talks collapsing. Separately, Green has held talks with the Pension Regulator about injecting cash into the company\u2019s pension scheme. He is thought to have offered \u00a340m in cash and a \u00a340m loan secured against BHS\u2019s assets.",

      "bodyText": "When Zinedine Zidane, the then French captain, headbutted Italy\u2019s Marco Materazzi during the 2006 World Cup final, the clash quickly became one of the most infamous incidents in football history. What was not clear was what sparked the Frenchman\u2019s ire \u2013 Zidane said his mother had been insulted, a charge that Materazzi vigorously denied. The head-butt got Zidane sent off and Italy won the game. However, had there been technology there to identify what was said, the result could have been very different, Helen Bear believes. \u201cIf a machine lip-reader was in existence, the other player [could] have got sent off too so it would have been 10 men against each other in a World Cup final,\u201d she argues. Bear is one of a number of researchers at the University of East Anglia focusing on ways to teach computers to read people\u2019s lips, technology that could be used in artificial intelligence applications. A three-year study at the university\u2019s school of computer studies could prove a significant advance in the science behind automated lip-reading, which is still in its early stages. The technology could help people who have recently lost their hearing and, on a more basic level, it could improve our interactions with gadgets that are usually controlled by hand. \u201cFor those who suffer post-lingual hearing loss, it is a a lot harder for them to learn to lip-read than someone who was deaf from birth, purely because if you have to learn from birth you are surrounded by all of this visual information. Some sort of technology that could help with that would be invaluable,\u201d she says. In practical terms, the system could work using the camera on a smartphone to read the speaker\u2019s lips and then carry out commands. One of the main problems faced by researchers is that some of the sounds that are made when people talk relate to a very similar facial expression. These shapes that the mouth makes are known as visemes. However, there are many more sounds, or phonemes, made during speech. This means that the viseme can have a number of meanings. A human lip-reader needs to figure out what is the actual meaning and also relies on other information such as the context of what is being talked about and body language. In a similar way, machines working to pinpoint what is being said by analysing the movement of the mouth have the same problem when the different sounds have similar facial appearances. \u201cThis is where we get this confusability,\u201d says Bear, who has recently completed her PhD. Her breakthrough has been in finding a new way to distinguish the sounds, which appear similar on the face, by identifying subtle differences which computers will be taught to recognise . By doing this, the different words can then take shape and the computer can lip-read what a person is saying. The development is significant, says Prof Richard Harvey, who has been working with Bear on the research. \u201cLip-reading is one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence so it\u2019s great to make progress on one of the trickier aspects, which is how to train machines to recognise the appearance and shape of human lips,\u201d he says. The possibility of machines being able to lip-read could allow people to control devices without using their hands, such as when driving. A smartphone being used as a satnav could still pick up commands even if background or engine noise drowns out the speaker. And for someone who is outside using a phone whose call is being disrupted by wind noise, the camera could switch itself on and pick up what is being said. In other areas of research, using advances in technology has meant that volume controls in cars can now be manipulated using gesture controls similar to those of games machines, and cookers may soon have the ability to be turned on and off without being touched. Bear says that while the reality of this happening is some way off, it is possible. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why lip-reading technology will not exist at some point,\u201d she says. With the possibility that a machine can read someone\u2019s lips and then the words are displayed on a screen will inevitably raise privacy concerns about the possible uses for this new strand of artificial intelligence. \u201cThe whole point is that the machine is learning something that as humans we have not been able to do by ourselves, which is quite exciting. I know some people are wary [about artificial intelligence]. My personal opinion is that if you are careful, if you properly develop something and test it as far as you can, everything should be OK. It is all about having good software engineering practices and principles,\u201d Bear says. \u2022 For more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally, go to our archive of the innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website.

These shapes that the mouth makes are known as visemes. However, there are many more sounds, or phonemes, made during speech. </p> <p> This means that the viseme can have a number of meanings. A human lip-reader needs to figure out what is the actual meaning and also relies on other information such as the context of what is being talked about and body language. In a similar way, machines working to pinpoint what is being said by analysing the movement of the mouth have the same problem when the different sounds have similar facial appearances. \u201cThis is where we get this confusability,\u201d says Bear, who has recently completed her PhD.</p> <p>Her breakthrough has been in finding a new way to distinguish the sounds, which appear similar on the face, by identifying subtle differences which computers will be taught to recognise . By doing this, the different words can then take shape and the computer can lip-read what a person is saying.</p> <p> The development is significant, says Prof Richard Harvey, who has been working with Bear on the research. \u201cLip-reading is one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence so it\u2019s great to make progress on one of the trickier aspects, which is how to train machines to recognise the appearance and shape of human lips,\u201d he says.</p> <p> The possibility of machines being able to lip-read could allow people to control devices without using their hands, such as when driving. A smartphone being used as a satnav could still pick up commands even if background or engine noise drowns out the speaker. And for someone who is outside using a phone whose call is being disrupted by wind noise, the camera could switch itself on and pick up what is being said.</p> <p> In other areas of research, using advances in technology has meant that <a href=\"http://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/7series/sedan/2015/showroom/innovative_functionality.html\">volume controls in cars can now be manipulated using gesture controls</a> similar to those of games machines, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/25/the-innovators-invisible-buttons-ultrahaptics\">cookers may soon have the ability to be turned on and off without being touched</a>.</p> <p> Bear says that while the reality of this happening is some way off, it is possible. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why lip-reading technology will not exist at some point,\u201d she says. </p> <p> </p> <p>With the possibility that a machine can read someone\u2019s lips and then the words are displayed on a screen will inevitably raise <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/530641/the-challenges-and-threats-of-automated-lip-reading/\">privacy concerns about the possible uses</a> for this new strand of artificial intelligence.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole point is that the machine is learning something that as humans we have not been able to do by ourselves, which is quite exciting. I know some people are wary [about artificial intelligence]. My personal opinion is that if you are careful, if you properly develop something and test it as far as you can, everything should be OK. It is all about having good software engineering practices and principles,\u201d Bear says.</p> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p> \u2022 For more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally, go to our archive of the innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a>.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 25 April 2016.

      "bodyText": "The pressures on the UK economy from EU referendum jitters and a downturn in global trade will be revealed this week with the publication on Wednesday of official UK growth figures. Nervous investors and policymakers are also keenly awaiting GDP updates from the US and eurozone to gauge the scale of a global slowdown that has prompted wild swings on stock markets in recent months and warnings from the International Monetary Fund that governments need to step up public investment to avert a slump. The UK figures are expected to show a marked slowdown in growth after business surveys pointed to companies delaying spending and hiring ahead of the Brexit vote. Official figures showing a drop in retail sales last week suggested consumers, the main drivers of the UK\u2019s post-crisis recovery, were also cutting back as pay growth flatlines and government spending cuts bite. Economists anticipate that those factors dented the economy\u2019s overall performance in the first quarter, cutting the GDP growth rate to 0.4% from 0.6% in the final three months of 2015, according to the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll. Economists at HSBC are more downbeat than the consensus and they forecast the growth rate halved in the first quarter to 0.3%. \u201cAll the signs are that growth slowed in the first quarter,\u201d they wrote in a research note. They cite last week\u2019s news of a sharp fall in retail sales in March, downbeat surveys from the wider services sector and a drag on the economy from manufacturing and the oil and gas sectors. Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, said he is expecting a \u201cmixed picture\u201d from the UK economy. \u201cOn the positive side, our \u2018nowcasts\u2019 suggest that construction expanded by 0.6% on the quarter and services by 0.7%. However, at the same time our estimates are for a 1.0% fall in industrial production, including a 0.5% contraction in manufacturing. Overall this would give us a 0.4% increase in GDP with, if anything, the risks tilted towards a slightly faster pace of growth,\u201d said Shaw. The Bank of England has warned that growth could slow further in the second quarter as uncertainty about the EU referendum outcome prompts companies to delay investment decisions. But some economists caution that the pressures on the UK economy go beyond Brexit worries and that there are also longer-standing problems such as low productivity growth as well as headwinds from the global economy. In the US, the world\u2019s largest economy, growth is expected to have slowed in the first quarter. Economists expect the annual growth rate of GDP, released on Thursday, to drop to 0.7% from 1.4% in the final quarter of 2015. The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in almost a decade late last year but against the backdrop of global turmoil it has become more cautious about raising borrowing costs further. No move is expected at the central bank\u2019s Wednesday meeting but the statement from policymakers \u201cwill be scrutinised for signs that a June rate hike remains on the table,\u201d said Chris Scicluna at Daiwa Capital Markets. The eurozone caps off the trio of big economy GDP readings on Friday, and economists expect slightly brighter news from the single currency bloc. Quarterly growth is forecast to have edged up to 0.4% from 0.3% in the fourth quarter.",

      "bodyText": "The day after the Queen celebrated her 90th birthday, the Obamas came for lunch. Prince Philip, almost five years older than his wife, got behind the wheel of a Range Rover to drive the president and his wife Michelle to the door of Windsor Castle. What has this got to do with economics? On the face of it, not much. For many, the news coverage to mark the start of Her Majesty\u2019s 10th decade was a blessed relief from rising unemployment and the partial nationalisation of the steel industry. Newspapers pushed the debate about the EU referendum on to inside pages in favour of pictures of the Queen as she is now and how she was way back when. Yet the Queen exemplifies a trend that will have a profound economic effect in the years to come, namely that we are all living longer. There was shock last week that Victoria Wood and Prince died last week at the age of 62 and 57 respectively, and with good reason. Those who make it to 60 today can expect to live for another 30 years. Wood and Prince have had their lives cut short, but they are the exception to the rule. By coincidence, the Office for National Statistics published its latest estimates of the \u201cvery old\u201d last week. In 2014, the last year for which data is available, there were more than 500,000 people aged 90 and over in the UK. Thirty years ago, 2% of the population aged 65 and over was 90 or above. In 2014 it was 5%. It is the same across the developed world. Longevity is at its most marked in Japan, followed by Italy and France. The ONS data only captures the half the story. In their forthcoming book, The 100 Year Life, Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott note that today\u2019s 20-year-olds can expect to live until they are 105. We have got used to the idea that populations are greying, with the balance shifting between those of working age and those who have retired. Longevity, however, requires a fundamental rethink of the way we organise our lives and order our societies. For a start, it means that people are going to have to work longer \u2013 a lot longer, in fact. The government has already raised the state pension age, and employment growth since the global recession of 2008 has been fastest among the over 65s. If you are one of the twentysomethings who can expect to live until you are 100, at what age can you expect to retire? If you put away 10% of your earnings into a pension and expect to live on 50% of your final salary, the answer is that you will have to work into your early 80s. This raises all sorts of other issues, not least what sorts of job people are going to be doing in the future. One of the other big driving forces of the modern economy is disruptive technology. Computers are getting smarter year by year, and that threatens to hollow out the labour market. Put simply, robots are going to do more of the routine tasks that have traditionally offered stable full-time employment, and some professional jobs as well. Economists assume, on the basis of the evidence of the past two centuries, that technological change creates rather destroys jobs. There is deep mistrust of the so-called \u201clump of labour\u201d fallacy, the idea that there is only so much work to go round. To take one example, Ren\u00e9 B\u00f6heim of the Johannes Kepler University in Linz has found that delaying retirement does not lead to fewer jobs for young workers. On the contrary, the evidence is that policies which encourage the employment of older workers lead to stronger demand for younger workers as well. It is possible that the disruption to the labour market that robots and artificial intelligence will causedwarfs anything that has been seen in the past. As machines have taken over from humans in the manufacturing sector there has been rapid employment growth in the service sector to compensate. In future many of these routine white-collar tasks will also be performed by robots. What seems certain is that the person who gets a job in their early 20s and remains in it for the next five or six decades is going to be a rarity. Until now, lives have been sliced into three distinct segments - education, work and retirement. This model is tidy and convenient for companies, but it is not going to be fit for purpose in a world where more and more people live until they are 100. They are going to start work later, take career breaks and spend time in their 60s and 70s acquiring new skills. Some of the challenges are obvious. The education system has to focus more on lifelong learning and on teaching people how to learn. The NHS has to live up to its name and become a genuine health service, because there is no real point in people living longer if they are going to be too ill or infirm to enjoy their 80s and 90s. More of what the NHS does will focus on encouraging individuals to take responsibility for their own wellbeing, not just eating healthily and taking more exercise but ensuring that minds are kept active and boredom fended off. Governments will need to promote policies that encourage workers in what we now considered to be late middle age to find new jobs when their first career comes to an end. The Labour MP Frank Field has proposed a wage top-up for those in their 50s forced into lower-income work, paid for out of national insurance contributions. This is precisely the sort of initiative that will be needed if people are going to continue working into their 70s and 80s. Last but not least, inequality needs to be tackled. The trend towards living longer is not uniform and the gap in longevity between rich and poor is growing. Among some groups in the US, for example, life expectancy is actually falling. Those who are doing hard, physical work or repetitive tasks are probably looking forward to the day when a robot takes over and they can put their feet up. It would be a mistake to be daunted. Life expectancy has already doubled in the past 200 years, during which time it has increased by two years each decade. Sure, longevity poses challenges that need to be addressed urgently, and if we fail to prepare properly, living longer could become a curse. As Gratton and Scott say in their book, however, if we get it right longevity will be a great blessing, the chance to live longer and better lives. This article was amended on 25 April 2016. The ONS figures for people aged 90 or over in 1984 and 2014 were a percentage of people aged 65 and over, not of the population as a whole. This has been corrected. The 100 Year Life will be published by Bloomsbury in early June.",

There is deep mistrust of the so-called \u201clump of labour\u201d fallacy, the idea that there is only so much work to go round. <br></p> <p>To take one example, <a href=\"http://wol.iza.org/articles/effect-of-early-retirement-schemes-on-youth-employment\">Ren\u00e9 B\u00f6heim of the Johannes Kepler University in Linz has found that delaying retirement </a>does not lead to fewer jobs for young workers. On the contrary, the evidence is that policies which encourage the employment of older workers lead to stronger demand for younger workers as well.<br></p> <p>It is possible that the disruption to the labour market that robots and artificial intelligence will causedwarfs anything that has been seen in the past. As machines have taken over from humans in the manufacturing sector there has been rapid employment growth in the service sector to compensate. In future many of these routine white-collar tasks will also be performed by robots. </p> <p>What seems certain is that the person who gets a job in their early 20s and remains in it for the next five or six decades is going to be a rarity. Until now, lives have been sliced into three distinct segments - education, work and retirement. This model is tidy and convenient for companies, but it is not going to be fit for purpose in a world where more and more people live until they are 100. They are going to start work later, take career breaks and spend time in their 60s and 70s acquiring new skills.</p> <p>Some of the challenges are obvious. The education system has to focus more on lifelong learning and on teaching people how to learn. The NHS has to live up to its name and become a genuine health service, because there is no real point in people living longer if they are going to be too ill or infirm to enjoy their 80s and 90s. More of what the NHS does will focus on encouraging individuals to take responsibility for their own wellbeing, not just eating healthily and taking more exercise but ensuring that minds are kept active and boredom fended off.</p> <p>Governments will need to promote policies that encourage workers in what we now considered to be late middle age to find new jobs when their first career comes to an end. The Labour MP Frank Field has proposed a wage top-up for those in their 50s forced into lower-income work, paid for out of national insurance contributions. This is precisely the sort of initiative that will be needed if people are going to continue working into their 70s and 80s.</p> <p>Last but not least, inequality needs to be tackled. The trend towards living longer is not uniform and the gap in longevity between rich and poor is growing. Among some groups in the US, for example, life expectancy is actually falling. Those who are doing hard, physical work or repetitive tasks are probably looking forward to the day when a robot takes over and they can put their feet up.</p> <p>It would be a mistake to be daunted. Life expectancy has already doubled in the past 200 years, during which time it has increased by two years each decade. Sure, longevity poses challenges that need to be addressed urgently, and if we fail to prepare properly, living longer could become a curse. As Gratton and Scott say in their book, however, if we get it right longevity will be a great blessing, the chance to live longer and better lives.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 25 April 2016.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "So it was an apology of sorts, but with a sting in the tail: Bank of England policymakers don\u2019t like to say sorry. It was in this vein that Ian McCafferty \u2013 a former chief economist for the CBI, who joined the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) in the autumn of 2012 \u2013 said he had twice made the mistake of calling for higher interest rates. In each case, his reasoning was that wages were about to take off and would push up prices. The first time was in August 2014, when he was joined by fellow MPC member Martin Weale. Then he did it on his own, between August last year and January, before finally abandoning his campaign. But while he was wrong on the first two occasions, he said, he would be right next time, and the coming upturn in wages would be the signal for an explosion. Central bankers have only one hammer with which to bash inflation, and it comes in the form of higher interest rates. He would be ready and waiting, trusty mallet in hand. The reason behind his concern is that low unemployment must be forcing employers to pay their staff more \u2013 not just to attract the best talent, but to retain those in less-skilled roles. McCafferty is relying on the economic equation behind the Phillips curve, which demonstrates an inverse relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. The lower unemployment falls, the higher the wages that must be paid \u2013 and therefore the higher the interest rates needed to dampen demand and prevent price rises getting out of control. Yet the UK has low unemployment and very little pressure on wages or prices. So the next stage in the McCafferty argument is to show that low inflation is a global phenomenon and as soon as oil prices shift to more normal levels and a glut of food finds an equilibrium, there will be pressure in Britain for higher wages. That\u2019s because workers will supposedly demand a 4% wage rise to give them a better standard of living when inflation heads back towards the Bank\u2019s 2% target. But like so many mainstream economists, he just doesn\u2019t seem to get out much. A look at the UK economy through the lens of agents employed by the Bank of England to monitor investment, prices and employment shows declines dating back to early 2014. Operating from regional offices, these agents regularly interview businesses and rank employers according to their intentions to invest and hire more people. In the manufacturing sector, hiring intentions are negative. Is that evidence of a surge in workers\u2019 power and a steaming geyser of wages growth? It doesn\u2019t look that way. Even from inside Threadneedle Street. Then there is the seismic shift in Britain\u2019s employment practices, with self-employment, zero-hours and short-term contracts, and flexible shift patterns that suit some but hit the livelihoods of many, especially the young. In one recent example, cleaners at the headquarters of Nationwide building society in Swindon were told they had to work shorter shifts that started earlier, and work more unsocial hours. The changes, they calculated, would leave them up to \u00a340 a week worse off. The GMB union, representing the cleaners, approached their employer, building services company Carillion. Initially, the approach was rebuffed, but Nationwide subscribes to the living wage, which is \u00a38.25 an hour outside London, rather than the \u00a37.20 minimum wage for over-25s. For the company to keep its ethical badge, this must also be followed by its suppliers and subcontractors. After the threat of strike action and interest from newspapers, including this one, Carillion said the changes were its own idea and would not now be implemented. The point here is that most employers are under pressure to cut costs, and workers remain in a weak position. Would Carillion have contemplated such a move in a strong labour market? You might say the workers\u2019 power was demonstrated by the employer\u2019s complete climbdown \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t that the dispute has been rumbling on since last August and ended only when it became embarrassing. Most workers in the private sector have no recourse to a recognised union. They have to fight their own corner. And all the evidence is they are not faring very well. The international picture reinforces this view. Central banks remain convinced that they must keep credit cheap to oil the wheels of commerce. Without it trade would grind to a halt. Economists often look at construction, because the commitment to invest in infrastructure and buildings is a sign of confidence. But Caterpillar, the US construction equipment giant, said in its forecast for 2016 that governments and private investors across the globe were cutting back on road, rail and marine investment. David Blanchflower, a former MPC member who now teaches at the US\u2019s Dartmouth College, and Stephen Machin, economist at University College London, both say wage growth is nearer 1.2% and falling. \u201cIt is becoming increasingly difficult to envisage an end to this coming soon, in the current economic climate where nominal wage growth remains weak and only very modest real wage growth has come about because of inflation falling below its 2% target,\u201d they said. Higher prices will not bring higher wages. The world has changed. The Phillips curve is broken. McCafferty must wait much longer before he considers raising rates.",

      "bodyText": "When HSBC held its annual meeting at this time last year, the bank\u2019s shares were trading at around 611p. When outgoing chairman Douglas Flint fronted up to shareholders for this year\u2019s event last week, they were around 472p \u2013 23% lower. If the meeting had been held a fortnight earlier, the picture would have been an even more gloomy 416p. At these sorts of share-price levels, the market is valuing the bank at almost less than half the value of its assets. HSBC is not alone in getting such an assessment from the market. The UK banking sector is lagging behind the wider stock market and as all the major players publish their results in the coming fortnight, they will hope to elicit a better reception. It is all too easy to understand why investors would shy away from the sector. Geopolitics, cybercrime, pressure from digital startups and the risk of financial fines are among the great imponderables for anyone wanting to take the plunge. Errors from the past are still weighing on the banks, as HSBC knows all too well. A monitor installed as a result of a 2012 fine for money-laundering offences by the US has flagged up issues with the speed at which the bank is able to make changes to its internal systems and controls. Libor-rigging and manipulation of the foreign exchange markets have already shaken the public image of banks \u2013 and the fines knocked a dent in their profits. Royal Bank of Scotland, meanwhile, could be facing a penalty of as much as \u00a38bn for the way it sold mortgages to US investors during the sub-prime crisis nearly a decade ago. Its prospects of making an annual profit in 2016 \u2013 it would be its first since 2007 \u2013 are slim. And then there is the payment protection insurance scandal. This has already cost the industry more than \u00a330bn \u2013 and while the banks are desperate to draw a line under the compensation payouts through the introduction of a time bar, there has to be a risk that they will have to dig even deeper to cover the cost of mis-selling this insurance. Add to the mix the fact that interest rates are still stuck at record low levels \u2013 with little immediate prospect of going higher \u2013 and the banking sector is stuck in a mire. Banks are finding it harder to make money on customers\u2019 juicy deposits \u2013 and shoving up borrowing costs is difficult to pull off when other rates are so low. These themes will play out in the coming days when the bank bosses line up to provide their latest trading updates \u2013 and also face their shareholders. Barclays\u2019 new chief executive, Jes Staley, will address his on Thursday, personally delivering a message that appears likely to be very different to the one incoming chairman John McFarlane hoped for. A year ago, McFarlane described the dividend level as \u201cless than we would wish\u201d. How is he going to deliver the message to impatient Barclays shareholders that the all-important dividend is going to be cut almost in half for the next two years? Yet despite this dismal backdrop, with the reputation of bankers at rock bottom, the established players appear confident about one thing: their high-street customers are reluctant to rock the boat. Barely 4% of retail customers move their current accounts each year \u2013 a figure that could increase tenfold, challenger bank TSB reckons, if customers were given more information about the accounts they hold with the big four. One suggestion \u2013 handing over information about \u201cforegone interest\u201d on current accounts rather than savings accounts \u2013 seems unlikely to happen voluntarily. And the Competition and Markets Authority seems too scared to move \u2013 possibly the one piece of good news for the downtrodden banking sector. Even the director-in-chief has had enough of soaring pay First Sports Direct felt its wrath, then the entire corporate world. Having told the billionaire Mike Ashley, who owns the clothing chain Sports Direct, that his treatment of the clothing chain\u2019s low-paid warehouse staff \u201cwill leave a scar on British business\u201d, the Institute of Directors has sent out a wider warning: allow executive pay to soar and the roof will fall in. Or, at least, a welter of government regulation will be imposed on boards, tying them up in administrative knots. It is a counterintuitive message in some ways for a traditional supporter of the free market. The IoD is the oldest of the business lobby groups and its Regency-era Pall Mall offices are steeped in history, most of it centred on protecting the livelihoods of its immensely rich members. Some club members must be asking themselves how self-imposed pay restraint could be considered a feature of a free market. Surely executives should be paid whatever a majority of investors believe they need to offer? But pay restraint is seen by IoD director general Simon Walker, a former press chief at Buckingham Palace, as the crucial element in a campaign to keep meddling politicians and unnecessary regulation out of remuneration. In this way he harks back to the Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith, who believed that owners of capital should accept they are part of wider society and honour a compact with workers to achieve a degree of fairness. It was either that or be crushed like the French aristocracy were to be in the 1789 revolution. After BP\u2019s recent AGM, when shareholders registered a protest vote against a \u00a314m pay package for boss Bob Dudley, Walker said British boardrooms were \u201cin the last-chance saloon\u201d. Walker took charge in 2011. In 2012 it looked like the shareholder spring would deliver a victory, but boardroom pay has continued to rise. This week the pharmaceuticals firm Shire is expected to face down a revolt and WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell will defend his \u00a360m pay package. If the votes against excessive pay are large and boardrooms continue to sail on, Walker, who steps down in October, must fear that the pressure for regulation will only build. Energy firms could get burned Business is business and if you expand too quickly nasty things can happen, whether you are in a technology of the future (solar) or a fuel of the past (coal). Just days after Peabody Energy, the biggest US coalmining business, was forced into bankruptcy protection, one of the world\u2019s largest solar companies, SunEdison, did the same last week. Last year Ahmad Chatila, the SunEdison boss, claimed he was aiming for his firm to be bigger than Exxon Mobil and his acquisition record suggested he was driving the business flat out to get there. But last week he admitted the firm needed to be \u201cshedding non-core assets\u201d to survive. It is a nasty wake-up call for over-ambitious executives but the solar sector is still booming \u2013 although not so much in the UK, where the government is determined to put the brakes on subsidies. However, worldwide solar installations are expected to grow by more than 20% this year compared to 2015.",
