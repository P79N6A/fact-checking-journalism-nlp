      "bodyText": "This week, if all goes well, Barack Obama will leave Washington to start on his customary vacation \u2013 20 days in Hawaii, returning on 6 January. If he manages to keep all 20 days it will be both a miracle for him and a disaster for the American economy. President Obama is currently trying, unsuccessfully, to negotiate with his political nemesis John Boehner, a leading Republican lawmaker, to resolve the infamous \"fiscal cliff\" deadline due on 2 January. America's fiscal cliff, to borrow a metaphor appropriate to the season, is something like the Ghost of Christmas Future. It is the spectre of an ill-conceived piece of 2011 legislation in which Congress, unable to create a budget last year, promised to create a new austerity budget by 2 January 2013. If it doesn't \u2013 and indeed, Congress has been remarkably serene about the prospect of pitching off the cliff \u2013 the United States will be hit with a combination of $110bn of fiscal blows. The first is automatic hikes in levels of personal taxation for most of the population, and the second will be deep spending cuts to programmes such as national defence. Approximately 2 million unemployed Americans will lose their unemployment insurance as the clock strikes midnight. And now, in just a few weeks, the US will hit its borrowing limit again, and be unable to pay its bills unless extraordinary measures are taken by the treasury. The treasury can buy about two or three months' more time, but after that, the country will default on its debts. Under such pressure, you would expect Congress to be rushing to come up with a solution. But in fact it's quite the opposite: there has not been one bit of progress. The scrooges of Congress hear the rattling chains of economic disaster and turn over in a fitful sleep, repeatedly slapping the \"snooze\" button to keep dreaming of a world in which they never have to compromise. No alarm is loud enough, it seems, to wake this Congress from its dogmatic slumber. It increasingly looks like none ever will be. Both sides agree that the government must cut the budget and raise taxes; yet they have made only the most feeble attempts to actually get there. The negotiating positions are clear. President Obama wants to avoid the fiscal cliff's automatic tax hikes on middle-class Americans. He wants tax increases on citizens who earn more than $250,000 a year, reasoning that they can afford it. Republicans, however, find this definition of \"wealth\" unpalatable. They are only willing to raise taxes on those making more than $1m a year, and they want to slash government spending on social safety-net programmes like social security and Medicare. The result? Snooze, snooze, and snooze again. In Obama's first term, it was attributed to an unco-operative relationship between the president and the leaders of the Republican party. Republicans such as Senator Lindsey Graham criticised the president for not being \"bipartisan\". That led to the creation of sloppy economic and financial policy. In 2009, after the American financial crisis, a call for financial reform devolved into thuddingly dense piece of legislation \u2013 the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill \u2013 that was notable in its failure to create a single real change on the spot. It was, instead, a 900-page to-do list that required every major decision to be made later \u2013 and usually, of course, by a committee. In 2011, Congress dragged its feet on budget negotiations for so long that the country was within hours of being unable to pay its bills. The United States lost its vaunted \"AAA\" credit rating. And it solved that crisis by creating another \u2013 the fiscal cliff. Now, armed with his re-election and perhaps the desire to avoid repeating past legislative debacles, the president has notably changed his negotiating style to a more co-operative one. In recent weeks, he has invited chief executives and Wall Street leaders into the White House to share their views on taxes and austerity. Strangely, the same Republicans who complained that the president was too rigid before are no more pleased by his co-operative tone this time round. In fact they're more combative. Speaker of the House John Boehner, who has been leading the Republican side of the negotiations, headed to Ohio last weekend with a saucy challenge to the president: \"Ohio has both cellphone service and airports \u2013 so if the president wants to talk or meet, it won't be a problem at all.\" Even this tone is progress: last year, in a fight over the budget, Boehner once astonishingly refused to return the president's call. Graham recently berated the president about the budget. \"How about manning up here, Mr President, and use your mandate to bring this country together to stop us from becoming Greece,\" he said. What Graham doesn't realise is that the United States is already Greece: we are in a vicious cycle in which kicking the can down the road seems like perfectly plausible politics. Boehner signalled on Friday that it's not a bad idea, in his eyes, to threaten not to raise the debt ceiling again. That indicates the queasy possibility that this political nonsense will extend for at least three more months. However, the real risk is that, no matter what the president does, it will extend for four more years. The rattling of the chains is only getting louder.",

    "webTitle": "Spurned Turkey looks east after EU courtship falters", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When European leaders look back on their mistakes, barring Turkey from entry to the EU might rank among the most serious. After decades of courtship, Turkey is turning east away from Europe and, according to critics of Tayyip Erdogan's 10-year premiership, adopting the state security apparatus of its neighbours, stricter religious education and the tax policies of an offshore haven. If ever there was nation in need of a warm embrace it is Turkey. It has one foot in the western camp by virtue of Nato membership, but economically there is a growing sense of separation. Only seven years ago, 67% of its trade was with the EU. Today that figure is 39% and falling. In the big cities Marks &amp; Spencer, Burberry and Body Shop thrive and Tesco has made inroads as a mainstream supermarket chain. Britain has strong political links through its support for Turkey's EU membership. Yet the below-the-line trade economists talk about as the key to integration \u2013 in raw materials, unfinished manufactured goods and services \u2013 is static or in decline. With the economy growing at a fair lick \u2013 8.9% and 8.5% in 2010 and 2011 respectively \u2013 and capable of avoiding the predicted slowdown next year to 4% should the government ease credit restrictions, Europe is missing out on a fast developing economy of 75 million people who could give the EU economy a shot in the arm. Rejection by the EU has created a vacuum that is being filled by religion and closer trade links with Russia, former Soviet states and Egypt that struggle with corruption while paying little regard to workers' rights and concerns about the environment. There are officials in Brussels desperate to keep the accession process in place. In Ankara, there are several ministers and opposition leaders keen to discuss EU entry, but the rejection orchestrated by the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, aided by Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, still hurts. Combined with the eurozone's woes, it has encouraged Ankara to steal EU business rather than join in. To understand George Osborne's cut in corporation tax to 21% in 2014, look no further than Ford's decision last month to move Transit van production from a former Spitfire factory in Southampton to vast modern hanger-like units in Kocaeli, near Istanbul. Kocaeli is one of Turkey's 19 free zones, which registered \u00a313.97bn in turnover last year and created employment for 54,000 people, an indication of Turkey's disregard for the EU's carefully constructed corporatist relations. Free zones in Turkey break the EU rules because businesses pay no corporation tax and employees pay no income tax if they export 85% of production. Companies and employees inside the zone only pay national insurance, rent and utility bills. For Europe's manufacturers, the success of the zones is painful. Industrial goods account for 87% of their production. When Britain, France and Italy are desperate to retain or rebuild manufacturing, Turkey's offshoring is a killer. EU countries can offer time-limited corporation tax holidays and even tax-free berths in ports for ship cargo en route to other destinations. But Brussels has yet to sanction income tax concessions. Before the financial crisis, Turkey might have thought twice about undercutting old Europe in such callous fashion. Falling trade and success in enticing EU companies has encouraged a more cavalier attitude. More than 80% of foreign direct investment in Turkey is from the EU. While Britain has failed to divert trade away from France, Spain, Ireland and Germany, Turkey is now selling goods to fast growing economies to the east and beyond. Opposition Treasury spokesman Faik \u00d6ztrak says the EU has played a dangerous game since initiating formal membership talks in 2005. \"Erdogan is always angry. He is trying to control everything around him and is giving ground to religious groups who want more power.\" He refers to a \"deep state\" in which the executive has forged an unholy alliance with the state security forced. \u00d6ztrak said Erdogan has complained about individual TV programmes and had them taken off air. Hurt by accusations that he was a hypocrite, he sued an opposition mayor in the Kurdish east of the country for defamation. The mayor, Osman Baydemir, must now forfeit a third of his income to Erdogan to repay a fine of 50,000 Turkish lira (\u00a317,388). Recent education reforms have also fuelled opposition concerns that Turkey is moving away from 80 years of secularism. Children can choose a religious education after four years in elementary school. They can opt back into mainstream schooling four years later, but the opposition fear many parents will encourage their children to stay on, especially after a ban on university entrance from religious schools was lifted. Mehmet Simsek, the urbane minister of finance and former Merrill Lynch economist in London, dismisses opposition accusations that his government is becoming more authoritarian and says the education reforms simply make the system more pluralistic. He is more concerned that the economy resists the influx of hot money that over the last 10 years has inflated the currency and boosted property prices. The hidden economy, which accounts for 30% of output, and keeping a grip on credit growth, 35% in late 2010, are also priorities. Simsek, who studied finance and investment at the University of Exeter, is the government's most prominent EU supporter, but concedes that rejection has encouraged the population to turn eastwards. He also recognises that the Kurdish war on the Syrian and Iranian borders is a barrier to entry. In 2010, Erdogan risked the wrath of a conservative establishment by endorsing secret talks with representatives of the PPK, which the EU considers a terrorist organisation. The talks failed, and the PKK has abandoned a ceasefire. The last 18 months has seen the heaviest fighting in more than a decade between the PKK and the Turkish army. Since June 2011, when Erdogan was re-elected to a third term, more than 800 people have been killed, according to estimates by the International Crisis Group. Even so, it would be a shame if the EU maintained its cool attitude should the Kurdish situation go unresolved.

In return for a moratorium on the \u20ac6m (\u00a34.9m) debts of his family's holding firm, the banks have insisted on sidelining Cipriani in favour of executives put in by the investment fund that partners the Cipriani family. The bar \u2013 famous for its smooth Bellini (white peach juice and prosecco) cocktails, succulent beef Carpaccio and challenging prices \u2013 has no less than 70 employees to ensure super-attentive service. \"That is our philosophy,\" Cipriani told the Guardian. \"But their salaries are becoming very high. The cost of our staff is 55% of turnover, compared with 33% [at Harry's Bar] in London.\" Cipriani said he had tried to get his waiters and cooks to accept a pay cut. \"Everything would be easy elsewhere. But when you come to do it in Italy, you have to deal with the unions,\" he said. Cipriani, who took over the management of the bar in 1950, said the change did not mean he would cease working there. But future negotiations with staff will be handled by two representatives of the investment fund that holds a 20% stake in the firm that owns the original Harry's Bar at the mouth of the Grand Canal, as well as branches across the globe from Los Angeles to Abu Dhabi.",

      "body": "<p>The FTSE 100 index looks to be ending the year with gains of about 7%, but it has been an <em>annus horribilis</em> for Britain's top companies in America. And the catalogue of misdeeds for which the UK's top firms have been brought to book makes for shocking reading.</p> <p>Four FTSE 100 companies alone agreed to record fines and settlements with US civil and criminal authorities totalling $10.4bn, or \u00a36.4bn, in 2012. That is the equivalent of 40% of the construction cost of Crossrail, and more than two-thirds of the \u00a39bn ministers say was the taxpayer's bill for the London Olympics.</p> <p>The picture started to sour in June, when Barclays was forced to pay $360m to settle probes in the US into the manipulation of Libor. A month later, GlaxoSmithKline announced it had been fined $3bn by the Food and Drug Administration for a string of abuses, including selling antidepressants for unapproved uses on children and offering inappropriately lavish hospitality to doctors willing to promote the company's medicines.</p> <p>Then last month BP received a $4.5bn penalty for criminal damage and regulatory failings for its part in the fatal explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.</p> <p>Finally, last week, it was the turn of HSBC, fined $1.9bn for a \"blatant failure\" to implement money-laundering controls and for flouting sanctions. These penalties echoed two settlements, also during 2012, totalling $667m agreed by Standard Chartered over breaches in sanction laws and other failings.</p> <p>So can we now draw a line under all this and move on in 2013? Not likely. The market is already braced for Royal Bank of Scotland to be hit with a telephone-number-sized fine from the US regulator if, as expected, it too is found to have played a role in the alleged Libor-fixing scandal.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we learned this month that the US authorities may even have Rolls-Royce \u2013 until now a paragon of good corporate citizenship \u2013 in its sights. American investigators are tracking early-stage inquiries by the Serious Fraud Office into alleged bribes paid by intermediaries for the aircraft engine manufacturer in Indonesia, China and elsewhere.</p> <p>In many cases US investigators can, and do, co-operate with parallel agencies in Britain. But the contrast in outcomes is stark. When, for example, Barclays agreed a $200m civil penalty as well as a $160m US justice department settlement over Libor, the bank at the same time announced that a lesser deal in the UK would see it pay just \u00a359.5m ($96m) to the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>For the FSA, this counted as a triumph \u2013 the largest fine it had ever imposed. But to many outside Canary Wharf, it still looked feeble by comparison with penalties elsewhere.</p> <p>To be fair, the regulator has gone some way to toughening up its approach to financial sanctions, announcing guidelines two years ago which it promised \"could see enforcement fines treble in size\". The first of these tougher tariffs was imposed last month on UBS, obliging it to pay \u00a329.7m for a failure to limit or detect the activities of rogue trader Kweku Adoboli.</p> <p>However, many signs still suggest that penalties at this level do not truly worry directors or shareholders at Britain's largest businesses, and cannot be said to act as a deterrent. This year, the overall value of fines imposed by the FSA on companies found to have fallen short of required standards more than doubled \u2013 but have still only reached \u00a3140m.</p> <p>The biggest repeat offender, with four fines totalling \u00a370m in less than three years, was Barclays. And one can only hope the surprise recruitment of former FSA chief executive Hector Sants as its head of compliance can improve the bank's track record here.</p> <p>A hint at the alarming nonchalance shown by many firms in the face of FSA scrutiny came as the regulator \u2013 soon to evolve into part of the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 sought to address several investment banks' failure to properly ringfence billions of pounds of assets held for hedge fund clients.</p> <p>This issue has become a top priority in recent years: the failures of Lehman Brothers and MF Global led to pandemonium as creditors and clients fought over assets. But even in the wake of such chaos, the response from several banks to entreaties from the FSA to get their houses in order was worryingly sluggish.</p> <p>The same insouciance was on display when it came to the FSA's anti-money-laundering initiatives last year. The regulator warned that many banks, large and small, were repeatedly ignoring the rulebook \u2013 though it refused to name and shame them.</p> <p>\"It is not a pretty picture,\" said Tracey McDermott, then acting head of financial crime. \"The banks are just not taking the rules seriously enough.\" If only they had been listening. Or if only the FSA had shouted louder, and got tougher.</p> <h2>The music \u2013 and the profit \u2013 fades for HMV</h2> <p>When Band Aid released Do They Know it's Christmas? in 1984, music fans dashed to Woolies, Our Price or HMV to get their hands on a copy. The song has been covered twice since, but it's fair to say that, should there be a third act, purchasers are more likely to buy the song with one click on iTunes than trek to their local music store \u2013 if it still exists.</p> <p>Indeed, the cause for which we need to rattle the tin is HMV itself, which is again in a precarious position after sales of CDs, DVDs and games slumped over the summer. On Thursday, new chief executive Trevor Moore, on his maiden outing for the retailer's half-year results, dropped the bombshell that there were \"material uncertainties facing the business\" and that it was on course to breach banking covenants early in the new year.</p> <p>Moore says he has ideas, but his options are limited: his predecessor, Simon Fox, sold almost everything HMV had, including bookseller Waterstones and the live music venues that were supposed to be the group's saviour. The sell-off did not even put a dent in HMV's debt pile which stands at \u00a3176m, compared with its lowly stock market value of around \u00a310m.</p> <p>A supplier-backed bailout brokered in January, which saw Universal Music, EMI, Warner Brothers and Disney accept a small equity stake in return for better commercial terms, was supposed to have put the retailer on a solid footing. The music moguls and film studios, whose profit margins are under siege from Amazon, need HMV to survive more than its battle-weary investors. But retailers are supposed to serve customers, and the latest data from HMV's core markets suggests shoppers are buying its wares with less frequency. In the six months to the end of October, music and games sales by value were down by nearly a quarter; DVD sales slid 16%.</p> <p>The people who hold the power at HMV \u2013 its banks and suppliers \u2013 have shown restraint in recent years, but with the coffers full after the Christmas trading peak they might decide it's time to stop the music.</p>",

Meanwhile, we learned this month that the US authorities may even have Rolls-Royce \u2013 until now a paragon of good corporate citizenship \u2013 in its sights. American investigators are tracking early-stage inquiries by the Serious Fraud Office into alleged bribes paid by intermediaries for the aircraft engine manufacturer in Indonesia, China and elsewhere. In many cases US investigators can, and do, co-operate with parallel agencies in Britain. But the contrast in outcomes is stark. When, for example, Barclays agreed a $200m civil penalty as well as a $160m US justice department settlement over Libor, the bank at the same time announced that a lesser deal in the UK would see it pay just \u00a359.5m ($96m) to the Financial Services Authority. For the FSA, this counted as a triumph \u2013 the largest fine it had ever imposed. But to many outside Canary Wharf, it still looked feeble by comparison with penalties elsewhere. To be fair, the regulator has gone some way to toughening up its approach to financial sanctions, announcing guidelines two years ago which it promised \"could see enforcement fines treble in size\". The first of these tougher tariffs was imposed last month on UBS, obliging it to pay \u00a329.7m for a failure to limit or detect the activities of rogue trader Kweku Adoboli. However, many signs still suggest that penalties at this level do not truly worry directors or shareholders at Britain's largest businesses, and cannot be said to act as a deterrent. This year, the overall value of fines imposed by the FSA on companies found to have fallen short of required standards more than doubled \u2013 but have still only reached \u00a3140m. The biggest repeat offender, with four fines totalling \u00a370m in less than three years, was Barclays. And one can only hope the surprise recruitment of former FSA chief executive Hector Sants as its head of compliance can improve the bank's track record here. A hint at the alarming nonchalance shown by many firms in the face of FSA scrutiny came as the regulator \u2013 soon to evolve into part of the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 sought to address several investment banks' failure to properly ringfence billions of pounds of assets held for hedge fund clients. This issue has become a top priority in recent years: the failures of Lehman Brothers and MF Global led to pandemonium as creditors and clients fought over assets. But even in the wake of such chaos, the response from several banks to entreaties from the FSA to get their houses in order was worryingly sluggish. The same insouciance was on display when it came to the FSA's anti-money-laundering initiatives last year. The regulator warned that many banks, large and small, were repeatedly ignoring the rulebook \u2013 though it refused to name and shame them. \"It is not a pretty picture,\" said Tracey McDermott, then acting head of financial crime. \"The banks are just not taking the rules seriously enough.\" If only they had been listening. Or if only the FSA had shouted louder, and got tougher. The music \u2013 and the profit \u2013 fades for HMV When Band Aid released Do They Know it's Christmas? in 1984, music fans dashed to Woolies, Our Price or HMV to get their hands on a copy. The song has been covered twice since, but it's fair to say that, should there be a third act, purchasers are more likely to buy the song with one click on iTunes than trek to their local music store \u2013 if it still exists. Indeed, the cause for which we need to rattle the tin is HMV itself, which is again in a precarious position after sales of CDs, DVDs and games slumped over the summer. On Thursday, new chief executive Trevor Moore, on his maiden outing for the retailer's half-year results, dropped the bombshell that there were \"material uncertainties facing the business\" and that it was on course to breach banking covenants early in the new year. Moore says he has ideas, but his options are limited: his predecessor, Simon Fox, sold almost everything HMV had, including bookseller Waterstones and the live music venues that were supposed to be the group's saviour. The sell-off did not even put a dent in HMV's debt pile which stands at \u00a3176m, compared with its lowly stock market value of around \u00a310m. A supplier-backed bailout brokered in January, which saw Universal Music, EMI, Warner Brothers and Disney accept a small equity stake in return for better commercial terms, was supposed to have put the retailer on a solid footing. The music moguls and film studios, whose profit margins are under siege from Amazon, need HMV to survive more than its battle-weary investors. But retailers are supposed to serve customers, and the latest data from HMV's core markets suggests shoppers are buying its wares with less frequency. In the six months to the end of October, music and games sales by value were down by nearly a quarter; DVD sales slid 16%. The people who hold the power at HMV \u2013 its banks and suppliers \u2013 have shown restraint in recent years, but with the coffers full after the Christmas trading peak they might decide it's time to stop the music.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Air travel and global communications promised to bring people together. But what two titans of those industries have shown is that modern technology can also reignite a good business feud across three continents. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic hangars sit beside each other at Heathrow, but the bosses are poles apart. In Mumbai to launch new flights recently, Virgin's Sir Richard Branson responded to a question about Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA's parent company International Airlines Group, with a simple \"Who?\" \u2013 a slight noted instantly at IAG's head office. By 3am, in the galley of a BA plane flying over central Russia last Sunday, Walsh was sharing a few choice thoughts on rumours that Virgin was set to announce a deal with American carrier Delta Air Lines. A buyout could only signal the end of Branson's beloved brand, he speculated. Branson, leaving New York for his Necker Island home, was quick to reply to reports of Walsh's words. \"This is wishful thinking and totally misguided. Will BA never learn?\" he wrote on his blog, offering a \u00a31m bet that Virgin Atlantic's name would still be on the planes in five years' time. Walsh, now in the South Korean capital, Seoul, responded that if Branson was saying he would still own the airline in its current form, it was an interesting bet. But he wanted to even the stakes up with the man he called a billionaire banker: \"I don't think a million pounds would hurt him. A knee in the groin maybe \u2013 I'm sure that would be just as painful for him as me.\" Branson, back in Necker \u2013 with details of Delta's \u00a3224m purchase of Singapore Airlines' 49% stake in Virgin confirmed in transatlantic press conferences \u2013 leapt jubilantly on Walsh's \"rather childish response\", saying: \"It seems a very painful and foolish thing for him to propose, but I would be happy to accept. We've got used to BA hitting below the belt over the years, but I'm confident it would be the other way around on this occasion.\" Although he referred to the bet as \"this bit of fun\", whoever gets to do the kneeing is likely to apply maximum force. Both men are keenly aware of the value of headlines, but this is not pantomime enmity: it's born of fierce competition \u2013 and it's personal. Walsh and Virgin's departing chief executive, Steve Ridgway, share public platforms and are amicable. But with the Virgin founder, it's a different matter. Bad blood between the airlines long predates Walsh. In 1993 the \"dirty tricks\" legal battles culminated in BA paying Virgin more than \u00a33m in damages and costs to settle a libel case. The price-fixing scandal of the mid-2000s, which led to BA being fined \u00a358.5m for colluding on fuel surcharges while Virgin escaped punishment for reporting it to the authorities, still rankles. Beyond these historic wounds, BA has been constantly aggravated by an upstart that took it on and \u2013 although only a fraction of BA's size \u2013 consistently demanded equal attention, and usually received it. Most think mergers inevitable in a perennially struggling industry hit hard by recession and sky-high fuel prices. Virgin though has not simply \u2013 until now \u2013 kept fiercely clear of alliances, Singapore's investment notwithstanding, but attempted to derail Walsh's own plans, including IAG's takeover of the loss-making bmi. Douglas McNeill, a transport analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, says: \"It's long been acknowledged that the industry would benefit from consolidation. There are simply too many airlines chasing too few passengers. \"But talk is cheap \u2013 Walsh got on and made it happen. He's put together four significant deals in two years: first Iberia-BA, then adding bmi and [Spanish airline] Vueling, with the American Airlines joint venture along the way. And Virgin has lobbied against much of that activity.\" In McNeill's view, Walsh \"sees himself as helping to create the future of the industry, and Virgin as an obstacle to progress\". Yet the deal Virgin struck with Delta last week, forming a joint venture on transatlantic routes that will (with competition clearance) see the airlines feeding each other's passengers into their own network, is a tacit admission that Walsh's vision of the future is inescapable. Looking ever more the minnow as rivals combined, Virgin needed something to emulate BA's own effective merger of UK-US routes with American Airlines. Aviation consultant Chris Tarry says the upside is clear: \"It gives Delta and Skyteam greater access to Heathrow, and feeds more of its origin traffic to London. And it gives Virgin greater access to the domestic markets in the States.\" But he warns that the \"synergies\" airlines seek in partnerships and alliances don't automatically follow. Sceptics of the benefits of cross-border consolidation can point to the problems of Air France-KLM \u2013 if not IAG itself. Ownership rules restrict takeovers from outside the EU. Brian Pearce, chief economist at the International Air Transport Association, points out that antiquated bilateral treaties on flying rights between nations also inhibit full mergers, so airlines are finding inventive ways to achieve the same results. Airline alliances, he added, had not resolved issues such as unproductive scheduling clashes: \"This is the next step from the alliance. Airlines have found they can plan their businesses much more effectively in a joint venture.\" Now both Walsh's and Branson's airlines will be buoyed in competition on lucrative transatlantic routes by a major US partner. And as for that knee-in-groin bet? McNeill, like Walsh, thinks there could be a threat to the Virgin brand if Delta gets the chance to buy Branson's controlling stake, but there are plenty of obstacles. While it doesn't take a contract lawyer to spot that these two wily operators have left enough wriggle room in the terms of the wager for 11 December 2017 to pass without any testicular nastiness for either, McNeill concluded: \"Walsh might be well advised to put a cricket box on his Christmas list.\"",

The meeting has been called for investors to vote on whether they agree with the board of the engineering company that its rail technology business should be sold to Siemens. It looks good on paper. Most equity analysts are convinced that the \u00a31.7bn being paid by Siemens is a steal \u2013 for the seller \u2013 and question the wisdom of a deal at that value for the Germans. The amount being paid for 40% of Invensys is equal to the entire company's stock market value before the news broke. But hearts may question if it is good for UK plc to see this latest piece of British knowhow moving into foreign hands.

It is certainly a question for Sir Nigel Rudd, the chairman of Invensys, who has already overseen the transfer of Boots the Chemist and Pilkington glass to foreign buyers. Presumably he has checked that activist retail shareholder Captain David Hawker, who led a spirited attack on the P&amp;O board for selling out to Miami-based Carnival Corporation, is not on the invite list. Steward's inquiry at Sportingbet A line of red flags at online turf accountant Sportingbet, which is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday. Shareholder adviser Pirc is urging a vote against the annual report on several grounds: that senior independent director Rory Macnamara is anything but; that chairman Peter Dicks sits on the board of longtime Sportingbet financial adviser Daniel Stewart and Co; and that executive severance terms are unacceptable. Macnamara's biography on the company website does not mention that he, like Dicks, is a director of social housing contractor Mears Group, and that until recently he sat on the board of Private Equity Investors, a fund Dicks chairs. Contrary to the governance code, which recommends no more than a year's notice, Sportingbet boss Andrew McIver will get two years' worth of salary, bonus and pension perks if he is made redundant, netting him \u00a32.4m. It's a live issue. But Sportingbet's board has agreed in principle a cash-and-shares takeover offer from William Hill and GVC Holdings, which looks likely to be formally accepted on Tuesday. If Sportingbet holds up the white flag, there won't be that much need for any red ones. Humiliation looms for UBS Another dump of damning emails will land this week as UBS pays the price for attempting to manipulate Libor. As if the Swiss bank has not already proved how out-of-control its traders have been with the jailing of Kweku Adoboli for hiding \u00a31.5bn of losses, it is on the verge of admitting that the rate-rigging scandal could cost it as much as \u00a3620m in fines with regulators around the world. While the size of fines hitting the banking industry seem to get bigger every day \u2013 HSBC paid out a whopping \u00a31.2bn \u2013 the revelations attached to the fines are particularly eye-catching. HSBC, for instance, was done because it had controls so lax that it laundered money for drug barons and bust sanctions with states deemed pariahs by the US. Among the details to emerge were the larger-than-usual cashier windows in Mexican branches to get more notes through. In the case of Barclays and Libor rigging, it was the little remarks the traders sent each other on instant messages as they fixed rates that were so illuminating. \"Done for you big boy\" will take a long time for Barclays to live down. Not long now until the email dump by regulators will produce a line with which to tarnish UBS.",

Among the details to emerge were the larger-than-usual cashier windows in Mexican branches to get more notes through.</p> <p>In the case of Barclays and Libor rigging, it was the little remarks the traders sent each other on instant messages as they fixed rates that were so illuminating. \"Done for you big boy\" will take a long time for Barclays to live down. Not long now until the email dump by regulators will produce a line with which to tarnish UBS.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the Office for Budget Responsibility recently delivered its pretty gloomy message about the state of the economy and the national finances to the chancellor, eyewitnesses were surprised at how relaxed George Osborne appeared to be. The reason, apparently, was that the chancellor was so pleased with himself for having landed what he regards as his big catch \u2013 the Canadian Mark Carney for the job of governor of the Bank of England \u2013 that the implications of the OBR report for his imperilled strategy hardly sank in. Now it may be that, having arrogantly dismissed any thought of a Plan B for the economy, Osborne for some time has been toying with what he might regard as a devilishly clever Plan C. That's C for Carney, the man he hopes will get him off the many hooks on which he has impaled himself, produce a dramatic economic recovery and lead the Conservatives to a triumphant election victory in 2015. What does it matter that the OBR's version of the economy's prospects looks convincingly dreadful? We have a deus ex Canada about to descend, so we can laugh off the OBR report, especially when it gives us room to wrongfoot that irritating shadow chancellor. There was no doubt that Ed Balls was wrongfooted; but I suspect not for long. Within days of the autumn statement, Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, was telling the Commons Treasury select committee: \"Putting a lot of weight on a forecast that borrowing is going to fall or indeed rise by \u00a31bn between one year and the next is ignoring the uncertainty. I certainly wouldn't be staking my reputation on a \u00a31bn shift in the budget deficit from one year to the next.\" Osborne and the Treasury had an easy time on autumn statement day, because they had managed expectations well and there was plenty of media speculation about the bad news from the OBR. However, Osborne may not be as clever as he thinks with his tactic of \"divide and rule\" when it comes to his assault on the poor. Leaving aside the unfortunate fact that under modern capitalism many workers are paid so badly that the state finds it necessary to subsidise employees, and in effect employers, to provide a living wage, the practice of cutting benefits at all in present circumstances is highly debatable from a policy point of view. We are experiencing a severe shortage of demand in the economy, and the austerity programme makes things worse, not better, quite apart from its punishing distributional effects. As that great old campaigner Michael Heseltine observed last week: \"Government appears like villains, descending like Mongol hordes on the most vulnerable, leaving community welfare like bleeding stumps.\" But let us return to the policymaker in the wings, Mark Carney: no cut in housing benefit for him. Indeed, the Treasury committee, when the governor-in-waiting appears before them, could do worse than ask how much he has managed to negotiate himself in housing allowances. Its members are not the only ones who may be in for a shock. Last week Carney hit the headlines with a speech in Toronto which, despite his denials \u2013 which now, of course, have \"previous\" \u2013 has been widely interpreted as heralding a marked change in the approach to monetary policy, with a greater emphasis on growth and employment rather than the inflation target, which has been the holy grail for two decades now. Of course it is the elected government of the day that is in ultimate charge of the regime in which the Bank of England is free to alter, or not, its interest rate \u2013 which in turn is supposed to set the example for other rates. It is not clear yet, for all the worship Carney is attracting, whether he is speaking with the approval of the chancellor or shooting from the hip. One recalls how, when Robin Leigh-Pemberton was made governor in 1983, he gave some unguarded interviews before arriving in Threadneedle Street, and was advised to keep his counsel. Superficially, Carney appears to have a major change of policy in mind. He likes the idea of targeting nominal gross domestic product, ie real growth plus inflation rather than inflation alone. Sir Samuel Brittan has been advocating such a policy for decades in the Financial Times, although that great Treasury permanent secretary Sir Douglas Wass always maintained that for operational purposes nominal GDP was too much of a \"lagging indicator\". There are also those who think that, by deliberately \"aiming off\" the inflation target, the Bank of England is already, in effect, halfway towards realising Carney's \"revolutionary\" change. However as Stephen King, group chief economist of HSBC, points out: \"There is over-optimism about what you are expecting to achieve from growth in terms of monetary policy.\" Central bankers may have absorbed the lessons of the 1920s and 1930s, and not made the Great Recession worse via monetary policy. But governments in the UK and the eurozone have not learned those lessons. The austerity programmes here and across the channel are offsetting what the central banks are trying to achieve with monetary policy. Things are bad for many reasons. But fiscal policy is making them a lot worse, with potentially dire implications for society.",
