After optimism earlier this year that inflation was falling back towards the Bank of England governor's target of 2% after peaking at 5.2% in September 2011, a survey released on Monday shows that he might struggle to reach his goal. The monthly inflation index prepared by the accountants and business advisers BDO dropped by 0.1 points in April, suggesting the welcome downward trend in inflationary expectations over the past nine months is ending. This levelling off sees the index at 102.9, well above the average trend level of 100 (2.7%), suggesting inflation is unlikely to reach the Bank's 2% target by the end of the year.

      "bodyText": "You've got to hand it to the Chicago school of monetarists. From what seemed like almost certain defeat 30 years ago, they are back in business. In the 1980s, there was the failure of Geoffrey Howe's first two budgets, only rescued by a jumble sale of under-invested state assets and ultra-low commodity prices. In the 1990s, they championed faster and purer markets, unencumbered by regulation. They claimed every area of economic life could be virtually self-regulating, especially exotic financial products. After the financial crash, precipitated largely by this flawed theory, instead of slinking away, they had another solution. Now austerity has run into the ground two years after its adoption (largely by the rightwing governments of Europe). Again no apology, just a pitstop for refuelling and a new proposal. Growth built on cuts in workers' terms and conditions: obviously this is not a new idea for monetarists. But it has been given a special place in speeches by Europe's remaining rightwing leaderships in the past two weeks. We can give you growth, said Germany's foreign secretary Guido Westerwelle in a speech last Friday, but not at the expense of government spending cuts, not in Germany or Greece or Spain. It must involve supply-side reforms, he said, which is generally a monetarist euphemism for reduced labour rights. (And monopolistic practices, though in truth with a focus on cabbies and chemists more than big companies and the professions.) Westerwelle, leading representative in Angela Merkel's coalition of the free market FDP, said Brussels should also better target its existing subsidies, encourage private investment in large cross-border transport routes, and tear down more barriers to free trade. In Britain it is the same story. The Treasury said the Queen's speech contained measures to promote growth. Yet the only bill recognisably designed to support business is one that helps firms more easily fire staff. In this way, rightwing elites besotted with monetarist ideas continue to hold sway, zigging and zagging to keep control of the debate and combat critics of austerity. It is alarming how easily monetarist ideas have prevailed. Without much competition from left-leaning thinktanks and academics, monetarists have convinced working people they are the reformers and that social democrat parties are a conservative barrier to recovery. Social democrats only seek to preserve the privileges and outmoded practices that got us into trouble, they argue. Privately, or in small gatherings, they admit to flaws in their design for global capitalism based on an absence of regulation, but deny it provided the unstable foundations to the boom years. Using Margaret Thatcher's technique of constant repetition in parliament, in the media and to their constituents, monetarists maintain it was the profligacy of social democratic-style governments that was really to blame. There is no need to repeat the facts and figures that show this is a ridiculous argument. Suffice it to say that virtually all the government's extra borrowing in the past four years replaces missing taxes from property, personal incomes and corporate profits while at the same time paying more in benefits (and that is without including the billions of pounds lost in bank bailouts). The crime committed by Gordon Brown, Hank Paulson in the US and finance ministers across Europe of all political colours was to believe in the low regulation story and watch, with regulators at their side, as banks went on a lending spree. Westerwelle and his colleague, finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, are two of the most dangerous characters in European politics, along with our own chancellor, George Osborne, for their adherence to the bankrupt idea that Europe cannot compete globally without cuts in real wages, benefits and working conditions. While there are outmoded practices and crazy spending policies in different countries, attacking the living standards of ordinary workers is not going to produce the confidence we need for growth. Many hope France's Socialist president-elect, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, will undermine the dominance of monetarist policies, despite Westerwelle telling the Bundestag lower house of parliament: \"The fiscal compact to lower national debts is irrevocable. \" Hollande has promised to try to renegotiate the pace of public spending cuts, rightly believing that only with a boost in state spending in beleaguered sectors of the economy will the private sector regain confidence. This fact goes to the heart of any critique of supply-side economics. We can only leave the private sector to regenerate an economy if we have first let asset prices be destroyed. There is a myth that private businesses, in the main, take risks. Mainstream businesses, and especially those that are publicly owned, must be more circumspect. Banks ignored the rule because they enjoyed the protection of huge implicit state subsidies. Business owners will buy land, factories and shops only at recession-hit, knockdown prices before shifting up a gear, increasing investment and employing people. Only with the huge cushion provided by artificially low asset prices will these nervous creatures take their first expansionary steps. This is the first postwar recession where asset prices have been supported by the Bank of England. Without its quantitative easing programme, house prices and land prices would have repeated the 50%-plus falls of the 1990s. Instead, homes fell 10% to 15% and have since recovered by half, according to the Land Registry. In this environment, where asset prices remain high and banks, private or publicly owned, are weighed down by toxic debt, everyone will sit on their hands. Only collective action by citizens, which is what governments are, can make up for the restrictions placed on the private sector by shareholders. Westerwelle thinks of the Greeks much as Henry II perceived Thomas Becket: troublesome and better off out of the picture. But only because he denies basic economic truths for the southern European countries his government effectively controls. Without a route out of disaster \u2013 a cheap currency, a robust banking system ready to lend or booming export markets \u2013 they will crash. The only comfort is the FDP's low poll ratings. It currently ranks behind the Pirate party in some areas and has less than the 5% needed to gain parliamentary seats. With elections next year, perhaps all Hollande needs to do is bide his time.",

      "standfirst": "TNT Post trial in west London is one of several challenges from which the national institution is seeking deliverance", 
      "body": "<p>Like many postmen who have pounded the pavements of London over the years, Michael Rigby carries out his round with a bundle of letters, an encyclopaedic knowledge of his route and a distinctive uniform. But Rigby does not work for the great British institution that employed his forebears, the Royal Mail, he is a new recruit at Dutch-owned TNT Post UK.</p> <p>Even the letters, knowledge and uniform are different in their own way. Rigby's mail is franked with an alien logo, his walk is guided by a detailed printout including directions and timings, and his orange jacket is a stark sight in the west London drizzle. In the leafy streets of upmarket Chiswick, unsuspecting households are joining him in a revolution. This is the future of the postal market \u2013 a future that, according to the Royal Mail's chief executive, threatens a \"spiral of decline\" for a 376-year-old institution unless tougher conditions are imposed on competitors.</p> <p>The TNT Post trial is one of several challenges that the government-owned Royal Mail faces as it prepares for a disposal or partial sale in 2014. The company has separated from the Post Office network, which will stay in state hands, and its \u00a337bn of historic pension liabilities has been taken on by the Treasury. Solving the pension problem makes the business more attractive to investors, but TNT Post is a worry because if the trial becomes a nationwide operation it will take the most profitable business from Royal Mail.</p> <p>The Royal Mail's core mail collection and delivery unit \u2013 picking up the post, sorting it and putting it through your letterbox \u2013 has lost nearly \u00a31bn in four years. Mail volumes have fallen by a quarter since 2006, to 59m letters and parcels a day, leaving the company with an ever tougher challenge to make a profit. All the while it must carry out its universal service obligation to deliver mail anywhere in the UK, six days a week.</p> <p>This is why Rigby and his TNT colleagues are a big problem. As he completes his round, crossing paths with a Royal Mail postman on the way, Rigby says he was inspired by TNT Post's pitch. \"They got us all on board by telling us we were part of something exciting. That's what motivated us at the beginning.\"</p> <p>Royal Mail's boss, Moya Greene, is concerned that TNT Post will cherry-pick profitable areas such as west London, thus reducing revenues that her company needs in order to fund deliveries to rural areas under the universal service obligation. TNT Post delivers business post only, for customers such as British Gas and Vodafone, which pay it to pick up their bills and direct mail. Apart from in the west London trial, that post is then sorted at TNT depots around the UK and handed on to the Royal Mail for doorstep delivery. The trial, however, creates a mini Royal Mail by doing the whole lot.</p> <p>Chiswick is a profitable area for the Royal Mail because it is densely populated, meaning there are lots of houses and flats generating demand for mail. Because of the relative affluence of the area, those households are likely to receive larger volumes of letters and parcels \u2013 Sky bills or Amazon book orders \u2013 which means more revenue for the Royal Mail. The company also benefits from scale in urban areas because it has large, modernised sorting centres that can process mail more efficiently.</p> <p>Rural areas, by contrast, do not offer the same benefits, but the Royal Mail still has to offer a service. Housing density is much lower, the sorting centres are not as modernised and the population tends to be less affluent. This means postal staff work longer routes for a lower return, in a loss-making spiral of high fixed costs and less revenue.</p> <p>An early morning visit to the Nailsea delivery office in north Somerset, one of 1,400 across the UK, gives an insight into the challenges. The post for the town and neighbouring villages arrives here having been processed at 57 mail centres across the country. Staff sort it and deliver the mail to more than 10,500 addresses.</p> <p>Kieron Lock, collection and delivery manager, says the job has changed hugely in the 26 years he had been based at the office. For a start, Nailsea has grown from a village into a small town and the number of delivery points has increased from 7,000.</p> <p>The nature of what is posted has also added to the challenge. Back then most post was letters delivered by postal workers, typically on a bike. Now the advent of email and online shopping means fewer letters but more parcels have to be dealt with. The Royal Mail's new growth strategy, being thrashed out by Greene, is likely to focus on parcels. As a consequence in Nailsea, the bikes have been replaced by a fleet of 13 vans.</p> <p>\"Five years ago the average delivery took three and a half hours. Now it takes more like five to five and half hours,\" says Lock. Hinting at the financial impact of the universal service obligation, he adds: \"Some delivery points are half a mile down a track \u2013 and you are using more petrol than the price of the stamp.\"</p> <p>The Royal Mail is calling for the TNT Post service to be regulated. This could result in TNT Post, which is owned by the Dutch national postal service Post NL, being forced to balance deliveries to profitable areas with deliveries to places like Nailsea. Rob Jenson, UK director of collections and deliveries at Royal Mail, says: \"If competitors are allowed to cherry-pick the profitable operations then that will put the universal service under threat.\"</p> <p>Under that scenario, there could be further stamp price hikes or a reduction from six delivery days a week to five or fewer. Ofcom, the industry regulator, admitted as much in March when it announced a 30% increase in first-class stamp prices and warned that universal service was \"fundamentally at risk\" without further internal reform at Royal Mail.</p> <p>The Communication Workers Union, which represents 140,000 Royal Mail employees, wants the government and Ofcom to get involved. \"I cannot see how the regulator does not step in and say this is damaging the universal service,\" says Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the CWU. But Nick Wells, chief executive of TNT Post UK, says the universal obligation is for national postal companies, not competitors. \"The universal service obligation is for the incumbent operator, not for us or anybody else. You could never impose it because you would not get any competition, and perhaps that is what the Royal Mail wants.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, Ofcom has warned that further stamp price increases could reduce demand for mail, locking the Royal Mail into a downward spiral of fewer deliveries and less income to service the 29m addresses that might want a next-day delivery. The message from the regulator is more focus on cutting costs. \"Royal Mail needs to continue to push on with its cost-cutting drive. It needs to become more efficient. We think it is plausible that it can be done without a degradation of service,\" says Chris Rowsell, competition policy director at Ofcom.</p> <p>Back in Nailsea, Lock says a postie's job is not as secure as it used to be. \"When I came into the business I was sat down by the old postmaster and told this was a job for life. With competition picking off the best of the business I'm not as confident as I was then. The public still expects the postie to come every day and that's what we want to make sure we can do.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 May 2012. The original said the Treasury had taken on the Royal Mail's \u00a337bn pension deficit. It has taken on pension liabilities of \u00a337bn and about \u00a328.5bn of assets.</p>",

That's what motivated us at the beginning.\" Royal Mail's boss, Moya Greene, is concerned that TNT Post will cherry-pick profitable areas such as west London, thus reducing revenues that her company needs in order to fund deliveries to rural areas under the universal service obligation. TNT Post delivers business post only, for customers such as British Gas and Vodafone, which pay it to pick up their bills and direct mail. Apart from in the west London trial, that post is then sorted at TNT depots around the UK and handed on to the Royal Mail for doorstep delivery. The trial, however, creates a mini Royal Mail by doing the whole lot. Chiswick is a profitable area for the Royal Mail because it is densely populated, meaning there are lots of houses and flats generating demand for mail. Because of the relative affluence of the area, those households are likely to receive larger volumes of letters and parcels \u2013 Sky bills or Amazon book orders \u2013 which means more revenue for the Royal Mail. The company also benefits from scale in urban areas because it has large, modernised sorting centres that can process mail more efficiently. Rural areas, by contrast, do not offer the same benefits, but the Royal Mail still has to offer a service. Housing density is much lower, the sorting centres are not as modernised and the population tends to be less affluent. This means postal staff work longer routes for a lower return, in a loss-making spiral of high fixed costs and less revenue. An early morning visit to the Nailsea delivery office in north Somerset, one of 1,400 across the UK, gives an insight into the challenges. The post for the town and neighbouring villages arrives here having been processed at 57 mail centres across the country. Staff sort it and deliver the mail to more than 10,500 addresses. Kieron Lock, collection and delivery manager, says the job has changed hugely in the 26 years he had been based at the office. For a start, Nailsea has grown from a village into a small town and the number of delivery points has increased from 7,000. The nature of what is posted has also added to the challenge. Back then most post was letters delivered by postal workers, typically on a bike. Now the advent of email and online shopping means fewer letters but more parcels have to be dealt with. The Royal Mail's new growth strategy, being thrashed out by Greene, is likely to focus on parcels. As a consequence in Nailsea, the bikes have been replaced by a fleet of 13 vans. \"Five years ago the average delivery took three and a half hours. Now it takes more like five to five and half hours,\" says Lock. Hinting at the financial impact of the universal service obligation, he adds: \"Some delivery points are half a mile down a track \u2013 and you are using more petrol than the price of the stamp.\" The Royal Mail is calling for the TNT Post service to be regulated. This could result in TNT Post, which is owned by the Dutch national postal service Post NL, being forced to balance deliveries to profitable areas with deliveries to places like Nailsea. Rob Jenson, UK director of collections and deliveries at Royal Mail, says: \"If competitors are allowed to cherry-pick the profitable operations then that will put the universal service under threat.\" Under that scenario, there could be further stamp price hikes or a reduction from six delivery days a week to five or fewer. Ofcom, the industry regulator, admitted as much in March when it announced a 30% increase in first-class stamp prices and warned that universal service was \"fundamentally at risk\" without further internal reform at Royal Mail. The Communication Workers Union, which represents 140,000 Royal Mail employees, wants the government and Ofcom to get involved. \"I cannot see how the regulator does not step in and say this is damaging the universal service,\" says Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the CWU. But Nick Wells, chief executive of TNT Post UK, says the universal obligation is for national postal companies, not competitors. \"The universal service obligation is for the incumbent operator, not for us or anybody else. You could never impose it because you would not get any competition, and perhaps that is what the Royal Mail wants.\" In the meantime, Ofcom has warned that further stamp price increases could reduce demand for mail, locking the Royal Mail into a downward spiral of fewer deliveries and less income to service the 29m addresses that might want a next-day delivery. The message from the regulator is more focus on cutting costs. \"Royal Mail needs to continue to push on with its cost-cutting drive. It needs to become more efficient. We think it is plausible that it can be done without a degradation of service,\" says Chris Rowsell, competition policy director at Ofcom. Back in Nailsea, Lock says a postie's job is not as secure as it used to be. \"When I came into the business I was sat down by the old postmaster and told this was a job for life. With competition picking off the best of the business I'm not as confident as I was then. The public still expects the postie to come every day and that's what we want to make sure we can do.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 14 May 2012.
