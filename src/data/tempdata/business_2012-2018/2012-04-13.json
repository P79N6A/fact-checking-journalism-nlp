      "bodyText": "Shying away from talking about money used to be an ingrained characteristic of the British well-to-do \u2013 it was a grubby subject best left to tradespersons. That taboo has been shaken in the past two decades by the arrival of a wave of super-nouveau-riche \u00e9migr\u00e9s with no such compunction. But the past few days have seen an extraordinary further departure \u2013 the upper-class politicians in Downing Street, following the lead of their chum Boris, have decided to tell us not just how much they earn, but how much tax they pay. Picking over every detail of politicians' financial affairs is not particularly constructive \u2013 it's hardly a killer question of public policy whether Osborne will benefit personally from the abolition of the 50p rate, since he certainly doesn't need the money. But his and Cameron's extraordinary decision to throw open their tax affairs for inspection does show the extent to which, in tough times, taxation has become a make-or-break issue. When Osborne announced that he would reduce the top rate because, he said, no one was paying it anyway, it underlined the fact that while paying tax is an unavoidable necessity for the vast majority of Britain's workforce, for a small group at the top of the income scale, it's an optional extra. Shrewd accountants can help the wealthiest to use a range of tax reliefs, introduced over the years to encourage activities such as investing in business or giving to charity, to cut drastically what qualifies as \"income\", and therefore to pay tax on less of it. They can offset any losses from a business they run, for example, or the interest on the mortgages used to buy a portfolio of rental properties. As in the US, where Warren Buffett has complained that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, that means the wealthy can face a much lower average tax rate than ordinary working people. In the heady days before the credit crunch, the logic was that business leaders must be allowed to become filthy rich, so they would go on sprinkling their fairy dust on the rest of us. But that won't wash any more, for two reasons. First, the myth of the \"wealth creator\" has been well and truly shattered. Many of Britain's top earners are not entrepreneurs in any meaningful sense: they're financial engineers, speculators or smash-and-grab venture capitalists, whose winnings are earnings, pure and simple, and should be taxed as such. Barack Obama made exactly this argument last week as he attacked Republican plans for tax cuts for the rich, saying that the US had tried the \"trickle-down effect\" \u2013 the idea that gains from wealth and success at the top flow down to help everyone \u2013 on a massive scale, and it had failed. Not only has the economic rationale for many of the tweaks and treats given to wealthier taxpayers fallen away, though, but a shift in the political climate means it's no longer acceptable to turn a blind eye. George Osborne's much-derided refrain, \"we're all in it together\", was a recognition by a shrewd political tactician that austerity on the scale he was proposing could only be sold to a put-upon public if they felt it was a collective response to a national emergency. Facing rising tax bills and declining living standards, most of the public feel in no mood to tolerate slippery financial dealings by those at the top. For both these reasons, the government was absolutely right to restrict tax reliefs. Put another way, Osborne's new rule that high earners can only claim reliefs worth 25% of their income (or \u00a350,000, whichever is higher) in a year is an insistence that the rich pay tax on at least three-quarters of their earnings, which is a small but welcome step towards ensuring they are treated more like the rest of us. Lavish once-a-decade gifts to art galleries and theatre groups will probably be allowed special treatment after the luvvies' revolt, but the thrust of the measure is fair. And it's fairness that's likely to be the sticking point for many taxpayers in the years ahead. Fixing the deficit won't be the end of the road for the tax debate. The costs of looking after an ageing population are rising inexorably: on the Office for Budget Responsibility's most conservative projections, health and pension costs will increase by \u00a380bn a year over the next 50 years. So there's a real need for what Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), recently called a \"grown-up conversation\" about what the state does, and how it should be paid for. That should mean re-examining not just how the burden should be shared between rich and poor, but, for example, whether property should be taxed more fairly than through the not-very-progressive council tax; how footloose 21st-century corporations can be persuaded to pay their way; and which mix of green taxes will best help the shift to a less polluting economy. As the IFS's Mirrlees Review showed last year, the tax system as it stands has never been coherently designed: it's a baroque accretion, the result of decades' worth of one-off measures and chancellors' gimmicks. Making it fit for more straitened times won't be easy \u2013 as the budget backlash showed, one person's VAT simplification is another's pasty tax, and studying the chancellor's tax return is hardly likely to raise the tone of the public debate. But the mess of tax reliefs that so \"shocked\" Osborne is a sign that, in these straitened times, a thorough rethink is long overdue.",

      "body": "<p>A rough week wiped out all the gains enjoyed by Britain's blue-chip shares so far this year as the European debt crisis sprang back to life. A sharp slowdown in China's economic growth to a three-year low added to concerns, along with weaker data on the US economy. Eurozone shares also erased most of the gains made this year.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 index in London finished the week down 58.67 points at 5651.79, a 1% drop on the day, having started the year at 5572.28. Banking stocks were the worst performers on Friday, with Barclays tumbling 3.8% to 214.9p. By London's close, Wall Street was down 0.6% while Germany's Dax and France's CAC fell by 2.4% and 2.5% respectively. A two-day rally was not enough to claw back the FTSE's 2.2% drop at the start of the choppy four-day week.</p> <p>\"The past week started as the previous one ended, with investors rushing out of peripheral government bond and European stock markets as concerns over the economic and political situation in the periphery rose,\" said Tobias Blattner at Daiwa Capital Markets.</p> <p>Italy and Spain are now at the centre of the storm. Italian and Spanish government bond yields jumped this week amid heightened worries over the impact of drastic austerity measures on the eurozone's third- and fourth-largest economies.</p> <p>The eurozone's blue-chip index, Euro STOXX 50, briefly fell below its 2012 opening level of 2315.75, but ended Friday at 2352.24, down 2.6%. Banking stocks were the biggest losers everywhere, with Italy's Unicredit plunging 6%. Wall Street banks JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo were not immune, despite reporting forecast-beating results for the first quarter.</p> <p>\"The underlying problem is the renewed concern that Europe hasn't fixed its problem,\" John De Clue, global market strategist at US Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters. \"People are not comfortable going into the weekend with a dark cloud.\"</p> <p>Spain will test investors' confidence next Thursday when it sells new two- and 10-year bonds. The cost of insuring Spanish debt against default hit an all-time high \u2013 credit default swaps hit 500 basis points for the first time on Friday, which means it now costs $500,000 a year to buy $10m of protection against a Spanish default using a five-year CDS contract. Italian bonds broadly recovered the week's losses, with the 10-year yield at 5.53%, as tensions eased on hopes of more rounds of bond-buying from the European Central Bank.</p> <p>However, two top ECB officials dampened such expectations after executive board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, in charge of market operations, said on Wednesday that the central bank's Securities Market Programme was still in place, allowing it to buy up debt of struggling eurozone countries if needed.

      "bodyText": "A rough week wiped out all the gains enjoyed by Britain's blue-chip shares so far this year as the European debt crisis sprang back to life. A sharp slowdown in China's economic growth to a three-year low added to concerns, along with weaker data on the US economy. Eurozone shares also erased most of the gains made this year. The FTSE 100 index in London finished the week down 58.67 points at 5651.79, a 1% drop on the day, having started the year at 5572.28. Banking stocks were the worst performers on Friday, with Barclays tumbling 3.8% to 214.9p. By London's close, Wall Street was down 0.6% while Germany's Dax and France's CAC fell by 2.4% and 2.5% respectively. A two-day rally was not enough to claw back the FTSE's 2.2% drop at the start of the choppy four-day week. \"The past week started as the previous one ended, with investors rushing out of peripheral government bond and European stock markets as concerns over the economic and political situation in the periphery rose,\" said Tobias Blattner at Daiwa Capital Markets. Italy and Spain are now at the centre of the storm. Italian and Spanish government bond yields jumped this week amid heightened worries over the impact of drastic austerity measures on the eurozone's third- and fourth-largest economies. The eurozone's blue-chip index, Euro STOXX 50, briefly fell below its 2012 opening level of 2315.75, but ended Friday at 2352.24, down 2.6%. Banking stocks were the biggest losers everywhere, with Italy's Unicredit plunging 6%. Wall Street banks JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo were not immune, despite reporting forecast-beating results for the first quarter. \"The underlying problem is the renewed concern that Europe hasn't fixed its problem,\" John De Clue, global market strategist at US Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters. \"People are not comfortable going into the weekend with a dark cloud.\" Spain will test investors' confidence next Thursday when it sells new two- and 10-year bonds. The cost of insuring Spanish debt against default hit an all-time high \u2013 credit default swaps hit 500 basis points for the first time on Friday, which means it now costs $500,000 a year to buy $10m of protection against a Spanish default using a five-year CDS contract. Italian bonds broadly recovered the week's losses, with the 10-year yield at 5.53%, as tensions eased on hopes of more rounds of bond-buying from the European Central Bank. However, two top ECB officials dampened such expectations after executive board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, in charge of market operations, said on Wednesday that the central bank's Securities Market Programme was still in place, allowing it to buy up debt of struggling eurozone countries if needed.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It sells itself to British tourists as a holiday heaven of golden beaches, flamenco dresses and well-stocked sherry bars, but southern Andaluc\u00eda \u2013 home to the Costa del Sol \u2013 has now become the focus of worries about the euro. As inspectors from Brussels demanded answers this week from the Spanish government about how it plans to bring profligate regional governments under control, senior officials admitted they were clueless as to the real size of the debt in the biggest region \u2013 party-loving Andaluc\u00eda. Antonio Beteta, the junior minister responsible for the regions, claimed that Andaluc\u00eda was cooking its books and hiding unpaid bills to cover up that debt. \"Andaluc\u00eda is not being transparent,\" he said. \"There is a problem of both transparency and credibility.\" Officials in Andaluc\u00eda reacted angrily to the claims that they were hiding debt. \"I demand that the EU inspectors come to Andaluc\u00eda and look at our accounts, because they are not opaque and there is no hidden deficit,\" the region's finance boss Carmen Mart\u00ednez told El Pa\u00eds newspaper. Beteta's words will not trouble British tourists practising their golf swing or soaking up the sun on Andaluc\u00eda's Mediterranean beaches, but they must have produced shudders in Brussels \u2013 and on the international bond markets that now view Spain as the biggest threat to the euro. Their worries are centred on the 17 regional governments, which together spend almost four out of every 10 euros of Spain's public money \u2013 as much as bailed-out Greece and Portugal spend together. Last year, despite Spanish pledges of austerity, the regions failed to cut their joint deficit by a single euro \u2013 sending Spain's total deficit wildly off target and leaving its reputation for budget control in tatters. That left the country having to borrow some \u20ac17bn (\u00a314bn) more than expected, with wary markets demanding ever higher interest rates as what was once one of Europe's lowest sovereign debts swelled. A new conservative government led by Mariano Rajoy of the People's party has so far failed to convince investors it can tame the regions and has seen bond yields soar over the past fortnight. On Friday 10-year bond yields \u2013 the interest rate investors demand to lend money to Spain \u2013 were pushed up to breach 6%. Andaluc\u00eda was one of eight regions that ignored government demands last year to embrace intense austerity, and which produced even higher deficits than in 2010. Beteta has warned civil servants in the regions, where payrolls swelled by 42% between 2006 and 2010 as local politicians expanded their power bases, that they must change their culture of \"coffee breaks and reading the newspaper\". Regional politicians are behind some of Spain's biggest and most costly white elephants. From Valencia's huge, spaceship-like City of the Arts and Sciences to Santiago de Compostela's vast, half-empty City of Culture, loss-making monuments to their vanity abound. A race to construct flashy public buildings by cutting-edge architects, combined with a taste for under-used infrastructure projects, has helped push up debt and deficit. So, too, have regional broadcasters whose vast workforces can dwarf their puny audience shares. On Friday the huge airport in Ciudad Real, 115 miles south of Madrid, shut after attempts to turn it into the capital's second airport failed. Its runways are now closed to the handful of private jets that brought wealthy hunting parties, some including British royals, to kill deer in the region's overstocked private estates. Ciudad Real is in the central Castilla-La Mancha region, the worst regional offender last year with a deficit that grew to 7.3% of regional share of GDP. The local savings bank, partly controlled by politicians, had to be rescued by taxpayers after it lent too much to property developers and bankrupt projects \u2013 such as the airport. In Madrid on Friday Brussels inspectors were seeking answers to how Spain thinks it can manage to meet its national deficit target of 5.3% of GDP this year. Many economists consider the task impossible, though Rajoy insists his government will make it. The inspectors were expected to demand proof that Rajoy's government can avoid the pitfalls of last year. The prime minister has this month presented a budget with \u20ac27bn of tax rises and spending cuts in the central government budget, but the key to meeting targets lies in the regions. Last year they failed to cut any of the \u20ac17bn they were asked to find. This year they have been set a savings target of \u20ac15bn. The socialist government of Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, which lost elections in November, had claimed until the end that the regions were under control. The finance minister Elena Salgado even claimed the regions had produced a budget surplus during the third quarter. But Spain was off track. It had promised its national deficit would drop from 9.5% of GDP to 6%, but turned in an 8.5% deficit that made it the laughing stock of austerity Europe \u2013 and left Rajoy's new government having to clean up the mess, which also includes 24% unemployment and a recession that will shrink the economy by 1.7%. The regions provide the key amenities of the welfare state, such as health and education, so regional austerity means cuts to basic services. Protests have been loudest and, on occasions violent, in regions that managed some deficit reduction last year, such as Catalonia and Murcia. Spooked by market pressure, Rajoy last week announced a further \u20ac10bn in health and education \"savings\", which will be implemented by the regions. On Thursday, the government passed a law that allows it to take control of the finances of regions that fail to stick to the austerity plans . Rajoy, however, may find it politically inopportune to take control of three of the four regions that account for most of the deficit headache. They include Valencia and Castilla-La Mancha, which \u2013 like most of the regions \u2013 are run by his party, and Catalonia, where any central government intervention would inflame nationalist sentiment. He may, however, enjoy taking control of the finances of Andaluc\u00eda, which is run by the opposition socialists. Rajoy's party failed to win elections for the region's parliament in March.",
