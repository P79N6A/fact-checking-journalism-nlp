      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s is to tour agricultural events around Britain with a roadshow that uses virtual reality to bring people closer to the fast food chain\u2019s supplier farms. The company will invite visitors to don headsets allowing them on to virtual farms, where they can drive a tractor and help harvest the potatoes for its fries. They can also go behind the scenes with a virtual tour of supplier farms producing eggs, milk and beef for McDonald\u2019s 1,250 UK restaurants. The roadshow, which begins next week, is the one that was recently banned by Labour from its autumn party conference. Labour\u2019s move, deemed by critics of its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to be evidence of \u201ca snobby attitude\u201d, also lost the party revenues of \u00a330,000. McDonald\u2019s at the time said it was disappointed by the decision \u2013 it has been allowed by the Tories and SNP to set up similar stands at their conferences. Technology developers, young farmers and experts from the leading agricultural university Harper Adams have been enlisted to create the roadshow, which McDonald\u2019s hopes will reach up to 1 million people at farming shows and other events across the UK over the next year. The \u201cFollow our Foodsteps experience will make its first stop at the Balmoral show, in Northern Ireland, for three days next week, and will also visit the prestigious Royal Bath &amp; West and Royal Highland shows in June. \u201cAs a nation, we have never been more focused on food,\u201d said Connor McVeigh, director of supply chain at McDonald\u2019s UK. \u201cAs one of the biggest customers of British and Irish farming, we want to lift the lid on the passion and skills that exist at every stage of the process, from farm to front-counter.\u201d The initiative comes amid staff unrest at the chain, marked by a global day of action in April, when fast-food workers protested over pay and conditions in 40 countries. In the UK, through its TUC-backed Fast Food Rights campaign, the bakers\u2019 and food union BFAWU (Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union) is fighting for a \u00a310 an hour minimum wage for all staff. McDonald\u2019s is one of the biggest single customers of British and Irish farming \u2013 working with more than 17,500 farmers \u2013 but wants to help its customers better understand its supply chain while challenging outdated stereotypes in farming. A YouGov poll of 2,000 consumers for the chain found 74% wanted to know more about where their food came from, but one in five could not explain any food production process. Two in five (41%) had never been to a working farm, despite national initiatives such as Open Farm Sunday. The initiative was given a cautious welcome by the National Farmers\u2019 Union. Its chief food adviser, Ruth Mason, said: \u201cThis innovative approach to connecting consumers with food production sees McDonald\u2019s UK build further on its efforts to demonstrate the vital role that farmers and growers play in its supply chain. However, we would like to see it improve its UK sourcing in some food sectors, particularly with chicken, where it is currently only 10%.\u201d The roadshow is the latest move by retailers to try to connect consumers with the realities of modern-day farming in the UK. In what it claimed as an industry first, Waitrose used a \u201ccow cam\u201d to capture scenes from a Berkshire dairy farm for its current TV advertising campaign, with other adverts focusing on a farm producing free-range eggs and fishermen who supply Waitrose fresh fish counters.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, has called for the resignation of the chair of a parliamentary committee investigating the retailer\u2019s demise suggesting he was \u201cprejudiced\u201d against the entrepreneur. The retail chain, which Green sold for \u00a31 to a little-known group of investors a year ago, collapsed into administration last week putting 11,000 jobs at risk and the pensioners in the hands of the government\u2019s pension protection fund (PFF). The matter is the subject of two parliamentary inquiries, which will hold a special joint session to take evidence from Green next month. But on Thursday, Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee that is set to begin its inquiry into BHS on Monday, told the Financial Times that he would recommend stripping Green of his knighthood if the retail tycoon did not put up funds to pay off the \u00a3571m pension fund deficit. Field said: \u201cI hope that I reflect the anger of BHS pensioners who feel that money is not there in the pension scheme.\u201d He said Green needed to make good the pension deficit at BHS so that it would not need to be rescued by the pension protection fund. \u201cI feel that Philip Green has a moral duty to make good the pension scheme and if he doesn\u2019t, while I can\u2019t speak for the committee as a whole, I personally would recommend he should lose his knighthood.\u201d Field said he had not pre-judged the inquiry. \u201cSir Philip is a master of bullying but he will find that parliament isn\u2019t for being bullied.\u201d Green hit back in a statement saying he was horrified by Field\u2019s \u201coutrageous outburst\u201d. \u201cClearly he has made his decision as to what he feels the punishment should be without even hearing any evidence from anybody about BHS or the circumstances of the last 15 years,\u201d Green said. Green said the comments suggested there would not be a balanced hearing when Field and fellow MPs begin their inquiry on Monday with evidence from the PFF, the pension \u201clifeboat\u201d funded by a levy on businesses. \u201cI think Mr Field needs to stand down from the inquiry immediately as he is clearly prejudiced,\u201d he said. Green said that BHS\u2019s board had not been involved in any decisions made by the trustees of the BHS pension fund other than in complying with their decisions. He added that the \u00a3571m deficit figure was based on the cost of a buyout of the fund by an insurance company \u2013 a much higher figure than the deficit if the fund is taken on by the PPF. Green has reportedly offered to put up \u00a380m \u2013 including \u00a340m in cash and \u00a340m in writing off a loan to BHS \u2013 in discussions with the pension regulator. The regulator has the power to pursue former company owners if they are seen to have left the pension in difficulties. Under Green\u2019s stewardship, more than \u00a3586m was extracted in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans by the Green family and other shareholders, including The Ivy restaurant owner, Richard Caring. Green has agreed to appear before an unusual joint session of the business, innovation and skills select committee and the work and pensions select committee. He is expected to go to parliament in mid-June after the committees have taken evidence from other parties, including Dominic Chappell, the boss of Retail Acquisitions \u2013 which bought BHS a year ago, and the BHS pension trustees. Retail Acquisitions extracted more than \u00a325m of payments, including professional fees and loan interest, from BHS in the year before it entered administration with debts of \u00a31.3bn. The Guardian has revealed that Chappell could be forced to return millions paid to his consortium during its controversial 13-month ownership of BHS. The legal director of BHS has written to Chappell asking him for \u00a350,000 that was not repaid after he moved \u00a31.5m from the retailer to an obscure corporate vehicle in the days before its collapse. Meanwhile, administrators are examining whether loans paid to Retail Acquisitions can be called in.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "BT is just coasting with \u00a36bn wave of broadband investment", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a \u201cfurther wave\u201d of investment, says BT, conjuring visions of Britain surfing to a fast-speed broadband future while other nations splash in the shallows. Don\u2019t believe the hype: \u00a36bn is a large sum, but not quite as it seems. About a third probably covers newly arrived EE\u2019s expansion of its 4G mobile network, which is spending that would have happened anyway. The Openreach broadband element \u2013 call it \u00a34bn \u2013 equates to \u00a31.33bn a year since this is a three-year programme. That\u2019s an upgrade from a current rate of \u00a31bn a year, but we\u2019re not talking tsunamis. Nor does the spending represent a technological revolution. BT aims to deploy \u201cultrafast\u201d broadband to 12m premises but the tally includes only 2m sites with fibre-optic, or fibre to the premises (FTTP), lines, which purists regard as the only kit worthy of the \u201cultra\u201d superlative. For its part BT counters that its G fast system, which uses copper wires for the last leg, is sufficiently speedy and more affordable for most punters\u2019 purposes. The argument would be almost academic if Ofcom wasn\u2019t so keen on promoting FTTP for the national digital health. In its last review, the regulator spoke about a \u201cgood outcome in the long term\u201d being 40% of households with FTTP. BT\u2019s plan \u2013 even when added to Virgin Media\u2019s investment in equivalent technology \u2013 won\u2019t get the UK to that level. It\u2019s hard, though, to see how Ofcom would vent any frustration with BT. Forced separation is off the agenda (at least for the time being) for the strong reason that an independent Openreach might have fewer incentives to invest. Thus plan A is to encourage competition by allowing rivals to use BT\u2019s ducts and poles to build their own fibre networks. From a regulatory perspective, the approach is coherent but it relies on competitors to BT actually risking their capital. BT\u2019s shareholders don\u2019t seem remotely troubled by the prospect. They can see their company doesn\u2019t have to break sweat with its \u00a36bn programme and they lapped up the promise of 10%-plus dividend growth in each of the next two years. The shares were the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100. The market\u2019s reaction is fair. But it\u2019s impossible to shake the sense that life for BT is just too comfortable at present. The \u00a36bn wave is underwhelming. Centrica\u2019s empty boast angers investors The first shock Iain Conn delivered to Centrica\u2019s shareholders didn\u2019t really meet the description. By the time the chief executive arrived from BP at the start of last year, cutting the dividend by 30% was the prudent course. But Thursday\u2019s surprise \u2013 a share placing to raise \u00a3700m \u2013 definitely moved the dial. Nobody saw it coming, thus the violent 10% share price fall. Strictly speaking, Conn has not diverted from the strategy he outlined last summer. After too many years chasing exploration and production assets that turned out to be overpriced, Centrica would be a customer-facing \u201cenergy and services company\u201d. It sounded commendably dull, as the owner of British Gas should be. It\u2019s just that investors had assumed Conn\u2019s intention to display \u201ccapital discipline\u201d meant the new adventure could be funded by internal cashflows. Instead, a couple of small acquisitions \u2013 one of \u00a3200m, one of \u00a3150m - has sent Centrica into a panic about a possible downgrade of its credit rating. The worry is legitimate since borrowings stood at \u00a34.7bn at the last count. But Conn was also banging on about being \u201con track to deliver against our 2016 targets\u201d only three weeks ago. You can\u2019t blame investors for being furious: if capital discipline means tapping shareholders for the odd \u00a3700m so soon after a dividend cut, what\u2019s the boast worth? Donald Trump should stop yelling at Yellen How bad would a Donald Trump presidential victory be for financial markets? Whatever your guess, add a few percentage points after the presumptive Republican nominee said he would probably ditch Janet Yellen as chair of the US Federal Reserve when her first term finishes in 2018. Fed chairs normally have to screw up monumentally not to be granted a second term whoever is president (Ben Bernanke even survived the banking crisis). Yellen\u2019s crime, as Trump sees things, is that she is not a Republican. Maybe you\u2019d expect him to take that line. But investors would also expect presidential candidates to stay quiet and not undermine the Fed chair until the moment of replacement arrives. Rolls-Royce puts a high value on Singer After all the fuss (at least in this column), Rolls-Royce\u2019s shareholders ushered Bradley Singer, the man from activist US hedge fund ValueAct Capital, into the boardroom with a 94% vote in favour. It\u2019s their lookout, but that majority is astonishing. Singer may be a fine fellow but ValueAct has a supporting role in the horror show that is Canadian pharmaceutical firm Valeant, a demonstration of how financial engineering can go seriously wrong when applied to an industry that runs on long-term investment.",

Don\u2019t believe the hype: \u00a36bn is a large sum, but not quite as it seems.</p> <p>About a third probably covers newly arrived EE\u2019s expansion of its 4G mobile network, which is spending that would have happened anyway. The Openreach broadband element \u2013 call it \u00a34bn \u2013 equates to \u00a31.33bn a year since this is a three-year programme. That\u2019s an upgrade from a current rate of \u00a31bn a year, but we\u2019re not talking tsunamis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/bt-roll-out-superfast-broadband-4g-6bn-investment\">BT to spend \u00a36bn on superfast broadband and 4G rollout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor does the spending represent a technological revolution. BT aims to deploy \u201cultrafast\u201d broadband to 12m premises but the tally includes only 2m sites with fibre-optic, or fibre to the premises (FTTP), lines, which purists regard as the only kit worthy of the \u201cultra\u201d superlative. For its part BT counters that its G fast system, which uses copper wires for the last leg, is sufficiently speedy and more affordable for most punters\u2019 purposes.</p> <p>The argument would be almost academic if Ofcom wasn\u2019t so keen on promoting FTTP for the national digital health. In its last review, the regulator spoke about a \u201cgood outcome in the long term\u201d being 40% of households with FTTP. BT\u2019s plan \u2013 even when added to Virgin Media\u2019s investment in equivalent technology \u2013 won\u2019t get the UK to that level.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard, though, to see how Ofcom would vent any frustration with BT. Forced separation is off the agenda (at least for the time being) for the strong reason that an independent Openreach might have fewer incentives to invest. Thus plan A is to encourage competition by allowing rivals to use BT\u2019s ducts and poles to build their own fibre networks.</p> <p>From a regulatory perspective, the approach is coherent but it relies on competitors to BT actually risking their capital. BT\u2019s shareholders don\u2019t seem remotely troubled by the prospect. They can see their company doesn\u2019t have to break sweat with its \u00a36bn programme and they lapped up the promise of 10%-plus dividend growth in each of the next two years. The shares were the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100.</p> <p>The market\u2019s reaction is fair. But it\u2019s impossible to shake the sense that life for BT is just too comfortable at present.

      "bodyText": "The Excalibur Steel management buyout has emerged as the frontrunner to rescue Tata Steel UK, although concerns about funding and pensions could still derail the bid. Sources close to the sale process said the proposed buyout, supported by Welsh billionaire Sir Terry Matthews, is the most credible business plan, but questions over funding and the pension scheme need to be resolved. More than 40,000 jobs are at risk at Tata Steel and in the supply chain after the Indian company announced it plans to pull out of the UK. Initial bids to buy the business, which includes the Port Talbot steelworks, were due to be submitted on Tuesday. The government has said it will take a stake of 25% alongside a buyer and provide hundreds of millions of pounds of support. Only two bidders have made their interest in the business public. They are Excalibur \u2013 a consortium that plans to offer employees a stake in the business and is led by the head of Tata Steel\u2019s strip products division, Stuart Wilkie \u2013 and Liberty House, the metals group run by tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. The future of Tata Steel UK is unlikely to be decided until after the EU referendum on 23 June, although a preferred bidder could be named before then. A source said Excalibur had submitted a detailed plan for the business, but added: \u201cIt really needs a lot of money and a lot of government support.\u201d Excalibur wants to buy the business without the British Steel pension scheme (BSPS), which has 130,000 members and liabilities of almost \u00a315bn. The pension scheme could end up with the state-backed Pension Protection Fund, but the Pensions Regulator could block this or demand contributions from Tata Steel or the buyer, which could scupper a deal. A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe are monitoring the situation and the issues this raises in relation to the pension scheme. We are engaging with the trustee and employer in relation to these issues. We will only comment in more detail if and when it is appropriate to do so.\u201d The government is understood to be ready to offer a loan to buyers at an interest rate of 3-4%, while the Welsh government could contribute up to \u00a360m in aid. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is in talks with the interested parties and has a team of more than 80 people working on steel policy. Excalibur is looking to raise about \u00a3300m for its proposals. As well as taking up the government\u2019s offer of support, it is in talks with banks about securing further loans and will allow Tata Steel employees to contribute funds, handing them up to 10% of the new business in return. A spokesman for Excalibur said the consortium did not plan to turn for funding to Matthews, who made his fortune in technology and telecommunications. He said: \u201cWe would prefer to undertake this without his involvement as an investor.\u201d The Community trade union has warned that Tata Steel is not providing enough time for bidders to put together a credible rescue package, and also expressed concerns about Excalibur\u2019s plan to ditch the pension scheme. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, said: \u201cWe have serious concerns that Tata Steel will not keep its commitment to be a responsible seller and will impose an arbitrary deadline that is too soon for credible investors to develop a viable bid. \u201cThese are national industrial assets that are up for sale so this isn\u2019t something that can happen overnight. \u201cAs far as we are concerned, this is still speculation about the implications for the pension scheme and is just the view of one potential buyer. \u201cPotential buyers are far from the only stakeholders and Tata Steel is still ultimately responsible for the British Steel pension scheme. There is a long way to go in the sales process and concrete proposals need to be brought forward. \u201cWe are keeping a close eye on the situation as regards the pension scheme and are in dialogue with the BSPS, Tata and the government. We are determined to uphold the best interests of our members throughout this process.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dragons\u2019 Den star Touker Suleyman is one of the potential bidders circling collapsed fashion retailer Austin Reed. Suleyman, who offers to support entrepreneurs with his own money on the BBC TV show, confirmed his interest on Thursday. \u201cYes, parts of the [Austin Reed] business are on my radar,\u201d he said. The owner of British menswear brand Hawes &amp; Curtis and the womenswear label Ghost, Suleyman also owns Low-Profile, a womenswear design and wholesale business, that supplies major retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer. Low Profile owns manufacturing sites in Turkey, Georgia and Bulgaria. Austin Reed collapsed into administration at the end of last month putting 1,184 jobs at risk. The fashion retailer, founded in 1900 by Austin Leonard Reed and famous for its suits, operates 100 stores and 50 department store concessions. It also owns the Viyella and CC (previously known as Country Casuals) fashion brands. Austin Reed, whose customers included Winston Churchill and Elizabeth Taylor in its glory days, has struggled in recent years and in 2015 used a company voluntary agreement to close 31 unprofitable stores. It also moved out of its vast London flagship store at 113 Regent street in 2011, exchanging it for smaller premises over the road. At the time of its collapse the administrators said Austin Reed had \u201ccash flow difficulties arising from challenging retail market conditions\u201d. At that time Peter Saville, one of the joint administrators, said: \u201cAustin Reed is a well-regarded and iconic brand and therefore we are confident that it is an attractive proposition for a range of potential buyers.\u201d A spokeswoman for the administrators said they had received more than 50 expressions of interest in the business. However, industry sources say it could be broken up, with its womenswear and menswear brands potentially sold to separate buyers. It is considered unlikely any buyer would be willing to take on the entire store estate. Austin Reed is also thought to be in the sights of private equity firm Better Capital, led by veteran venture capitalist Jon Moulton, which also owns Jaeger. Moulton described Austin Reed as an \u201cinteresting\u201d proposition. High street rivals including Moss Bros, Joules and White Stuff are among those thought to be interested in taking over some of Austin Reed\u2019s stores. In April investment firm Alteri Investors, which is backed by American investment fund Apollo Global Management, took control of the retailer. Last year Alteri loaned Austin Reed \u00a36m but its exposure is thought to be closer to \u00a310m after it acquired the equity and shareholder loans from Darius Capital. It is possible that it could remain on board as an investor.",

Low Profile owns manufacturing sites in Turkey, Georgia and Bulgaria.</p> <p>Austin Reed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/26/upmarket-tailor-austin-reed-to-go-into-administration\">collapsed into administration at the end of last month</a> putting 1,184 jobs at risk. The fashion retailer, founded in 1900 by Austin Leonard Reed and famous for its suits, operates 100 stores and 50 department store concessions. It also owns the Viyella and CC (previously known as Country Casuals) fashion brands.</p> <p>Austin Reed, whose customers included Winston Churchill and Elizabeth Taylor in its glory days, has struggled in recent years and in 2015 used a company voluntary agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/16/austin-reed-close-31-stores-restructure\">to close 31 unprofitable stores</a>. It also moved out of its vast London flagship store at 113 Regent street in 2011, exchanging it for smaller premises over the road. </p> <p>At the time of its collapse the administrators said Austin Reed had \u201ccash flow difficulties arising from challenging retail market conditions\u201d. At that time Peter Saville, one of the joint administrators, said: \u201cAustin Reed is a well-regarded and iconic brand and therefore we are confident that it is an attractive proposition for a range of potential buyers.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the administrators said they had received more than 50 expressions of interest in the business. However, industry sources say it could be broken up, with its womenswear and menswear brands potentially sold to separate buyers. It is considered unlikely any buyer would be willing to take on the entire store estate. </p> <p>Austin Reed is also thought to be in the sights of private equity firm Better Capital, led by veteran venture capitalist Jon Moulton, which also owns Jaeger. Moulton described Austin Reed as an \u201cinteresting\u201d proposition. High street rivals including Moss Bros, Joules and White Stuff are among those thought to be interested in taking over some of Austin Reed\u2019s stores.</p> <p>In April investment firm Alteri Investors, which is backed by American investment fund Apollo Global Management, took control of the retailer. Last year Alteri loaned Austin Reed \u00a36m but its exposure is thought to be closer to \u00a310m after it acquired the equity and shareholder loans from Darius Capital. It is possible that it could remain on board as an investor. </p>",

Gavin Patterson, the BT chief executive, didn\u2019t actually use those words, but that was the message that came out of Thursday\u2019s financial results. He is going to have to fork out \u00a36bn to improve the country\u2019s phone and internet infrastructure \u2013 if only to keep the regulator Ofcom off his back \u2013 but that\u2019s the price of keeping the cash cow that the wholesale division has become. In 2012, Patterson shocked media observers when he agreed to pay \u00a3738m to show live Premier League matches to his broadband customers. BT Sport was initially given away for free, and for the first time, BT customers had a reason not to move their phone and internet service over to Sky. Since then Patterson has hoovered up further Premier league games and, in what looks like a masterstroke, exclusive rights to Champions League and Europa League football ties. Anecdotal reports suggest armchair fans are starting to wonder whether they need to pay Sky \u00a340-\u00a350 a month, when they can get plenty of live sports from BT at a fraction of the price. BT has 1.5 million TV customers, up 28% since the start of this year. Patterson, a Liverpool fan, was keen to point out at the results briefing that the Europa League game between Liverpool and Manchester United attracted more than 2 million viewers \u2013 a BT Sport record. There was a nod to the fact that Openeach\u2019s customer service hasn\u2019t been good enough (borne out by endless letters of complaint to this newspaper). He admitted 5% of Openreach engineer home visits were cancelled without warning \u2013 a proportion he has pledged to reduce to a (still considerable) 2.5%. Surprisingly, Ofcom customer service targets in this area had been hit, he said. Criticism that BT phone and broadband customers have been paying for the sports rights \u2013 whether they like sport or not \u2013 through a series of inflation-beating price increases were similarly batted away. Last week the company said it would raise the cost of its monthly line rental and other charges in July by 5-7%. This follows a 7% increase in September 2015 and a 6.5% increase in 2014. Half the company\u2019s broadband customers are on more profitable fibre contracts. The fact that the company has been able to quietly increase prices by 20% in two years \u2013 with barely a murmur of complaint \u2013 is testament to the fact that fast broadband is now seen as essential, rather than a luxury item, in most households.",

      "bodyText": "Three more big UK companies have suffered damaging investor revolts over executive pay at their annual shareholder meetings. The latest rebukes came at bookmaker Ladbrokes, consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser and construction firm Carillion. At the Ladbrokes AGM, 42% of investors voted against the company\u2019s remuneration report. At Reckitt, known for products such as Dettol, Nurofen and Durex, nearly one in four shareholders opposed the group\u2019s pay policy that covers the next three years, and abstentions took the protest vote to 29%. Almost 18% voted against the remuneration report for the past year, which included a \u00a323m pay package for the chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor. Kapoor is thought to be the second-best paid FTSE 100 boss after WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell, who was handed a \u00a370m pay package last year. At construction firm Carillion, 46% of shareholders failed to back its remuneration report, including abstentions. The trio are the latest high-profile companies to face the wrath of shareholders, after huge rebellions at oil giant BP, drugmaker Shire and others. The chief executive of Ladbrokes, Jim Mullen, who took over in April last year, was paid \u00a3567,000 for the nine months he was in the role, and his predecessor, Richard Glynn, received a big payoff. Ladbrokes said it understood the concerns expressed by some shareholders over the payoff for its former finance director Ian Bull, who left in February. As \u201ca good leaver\u201d he stands to get up to \u00a3600,000 of shares for 2015. The firm said shareholder views would \u201cplay a key part in the board\u2019s thinking as remuneration is considered for the business going forward and the potential merger with Coral\u201d. Aside from its pay row, Reckitt is also embroiled in a humidifier steriliser scandal that has claimed around 100 lives and injured hundreds more in South Korea. Kapoor issued a personal apology at the company\u2019s AGM in London, just days after the company publicly accepted responsibility for its role in the controversy for the first time. The problem with the steriliser humidifiers, which caused deadly lung problems, came to light five years ago. Kapoor said: \u201cI\u2019m personally very sorry and very much regret that our Oxy product caused harm to people in Korea.\u201d His apology came a day after South Korean retailer Lotte Mart and several online firms dropped Reckitt\u2019s products. He reiterated that the company had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and vowed to ensure that \u201csomething like this never happens again\u201d. He said he would meet on Friday with representatives of the victims, a handful of whom had travelled to London and were demonstrating outside the AGM. Reckitt\u2019s disinfectant \u2013 a liquid added to the water of humidifiers \u2013 was among several products, also manufactured by rival companies, that were suspended by the South Korean government in 2011 after being linked to lung damage. At the shareholders\u2019 meeting the consumer goods group came under fire over top-level pay and governance issues. Cliff Weight from individual shareholder group ShareSoc said Reckitt had performed well in terms of shareholder returns since 2002 but even so, Kapoor\u2019s pay package was \u201cindefensibly high\u201d at \u00a323m for 2015, and \u00a356m since his appointment in 2011. Weight said a reasonable remuneration would be \u201cless than half this amount\u201d. He drew applause from other shareholders when he said: \u201cIt is difficult to have a cost-conscious culture when you are paid excessively yourself.\u201d Last year Kapoor said he would fly economy on flights under six hours as part of a \u00a3150m cost-cutting drive. A representative from responsible investment charity ShareAction urged Reckitt to follow other big companies such as Unilever in paying its staff the UK living wage as set by the Living Wage Foundation. Deborah Gilshan, from the Railways Pension Scheme, was also applauded when she voiced \u201csignificant concerns about the quality of board governance at the company\u201d and executive pay. She levelled her criticism at the head of the remuneration committee, Judith Sprieser, who has been on the board for 12 years and was re-elected on Thursday. She said the pension fund had met with Reckitt\u2019s chairman, Adrian Bellamy, to discuss its concerns. \u201cIt is a pity that the remuneration committee under Ms Sprieser\u2019s leadership has failed to address these concerns,\u201d she said. Bellamy replied: \u201cWe hear you,\u201d but defended the firm\u2019s pay policy, saying it was linked to company performance. He added that Sprieser had managed the committee \u201cextraordinarily well\u201d and was therefore invited to stay on the board. Sprieser said that the strengths of Reckitt\u2019s pay policy had been its \u201csimplicity, consistency and transparency\u201d and claimed: \u201cIt works.\u201d She said: \u201cWe take the feedback we get from our investors very seriously,\u201d and added that some changes to long-term incentive plans had been made.",

      "bodyText": "Some reasonable results from the likes of BT helped stock markets recover some poise after the volatile start to trading in May. There were more signs of weakness in the global economy, including disappointing UK services data and US jobs figures. But oil moved higher as supply concerns outweighed news of higher than expected US crude inventories, giving some support to commodity stocks. But there was little to really enthuse investors ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers, and the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 5.23 points or 0.09% at 6117.25 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.24% to 9851.86 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.11% at 4319.46 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.07% to 17,923.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.41% at 8689.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.94% to 601.48 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 41 points or 0.24%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for non-farm payroll day. More on Greece, where strikes are set for the weekend and a parliamentary vote on reforms is due on Sunday: Global economic pressures which have dissuaded the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again could be waning, according to one of the central bank\u2019s policymakers. St Louis Fed president James Bullard said in a speech in California: International influences on the U.S. economy have been widely discussed in global financial markets during the last several years. Those factors appear to be waning during the first half of 2016. Financial stress has fallen according to recent readings. The effects of a stronger dollar appear to be waning. But he said there was evidence for both the Fed\u2019s view of a gradual pace of rate increases and the market\u2019s belief in only a few increases: Evidence from labor markets, inflation readings and global influences suggests the [Federal Reserve\u2019s] median projection may be more nearly correct. Evidence from readings on GDP growth and market-based inflation expectations suggests the market view of the path of the policy rate may be more nearly correct. Which does not appear to shut the door to a June hike, following December\u2019s increase. Markets are struggling to make any headway ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, says: While markets have stabilised after days of losses, there seems little that can revive bullish sentiment as the day heads to its close. Despite an early attempt at a rally, indices remain under pressure, and it looks as if sellers will continue to dominate as the week enters its final session. ...Stocks remain under pressure, and with non-farm payrolls tomorrow the outlook remains resolutely grim. Further US dollar strength provides the reason for why there is little hope for indices at the present time. After weeks of weakness the impetus to buy the dollar appears too strong to hold back, which would provide a cogent reason for why indices have little ability to move higher. Ahead of non-farm payrolls, the market waits to see if the figure can best the number produced by ADP figures on Wednesday. Meanwhile Greece\u2019s unions have called a general strike for Friday and Saturday to protest against the tax and pension reforms due to be debated in parliament over the weekend, Reuters is reporting. Over in Greece, there has been talk of a possible weekend parliamentary vote on pension reforms, ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on Monday. The Syriza government is reportedly meeting on Friday: A solid US non-farms report on Friday could spark a near term revival in the US dollar, says Rob Carnell at ING Bank: April jobs report might uphold the stagflationary trend in US data. If we can take the latest GDP data at face value, then the first quarter of 2016 saw US activity slide to an almost standstill. Yet, the labour market continues to fare well and was the one bright spot amid a general soft patch last month Over time, activity and labour data are likely to converge, but right now there is little evidence to untangle how this will play out. Were the April jobs figures to come in on a softer note, then this would endorse the weakness in activity and imply that lagging variables such as employment are also now turning lower. Conversely, if the labour data stays resilient then we will further linger in a state of limbo as either it is the activity data that is the aberration or the lags have yet to kick in. The April jobs report may in fact accentuate the stagflationary trends (soft activity, rising inflation) noted of late: Payrolls to come in a tad softer than expectations (ING: +190,000; consensus: +200,000). While some indicators continue to signal a robust hiring backdrop, the softer ADP print suggests that there are some (albeit marginal) downside risks to jobs growth in April. Upward bias in the unemployment rate still in place (ING: 5.0%; consensus: 4.9%). The discrepancy between payrolls and the household survey (from which the unemployment rate rate is derived) is still evident, while the very strong labour force growth is unlikely to endure. A slight correction in both components may put some upward pressure on the unemployment rate. Robust underlying wage pressures should result in decent headline wage growth (ING: 2.4% year on year; consensus 2.4%). We note that the headline AHE measure has been hovering at the lower end of a range of US wage indicators, with the Atlanta Fed\u2019s wage growth tracker continuing to tick higher (on a moving average basis). Thus, we think the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher this month. US crude stocks increased by a higher than expected 2.8m barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.7m barrels. Meanwhile gasoline stocks rose unexpectedly by 536,000 compared to expectations of a 144,000 barrel decline. But stockpiles of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.3m barrels, more than the 83,000 decline expected. Brent is currently up 3% at $46 a barrel despite the higher than expected inventory figures. The price is being supported by the wildfire threatening Canada\u2019s oil sands region, as well as growing tensions in Libya. In the latest pay revolt nearly 24% of shareholders at Reckitt Benckiser voted against the remuneration policy and nearly 18% voted against the remuneration report. At Ladbrokes 42% voted against the remuneration report. The latest data on US jobs will not give much grounds for optimism for Friday\u2019s non-farm numbers, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said: [Weekly jobless claims] have generally been a bright spot over the past few years. They used to come in around the high 300,000s \u2013 even topping 400,000 at the end of 2012. But now we are used to seeing claims coming in below 300,000 on a regular basis. But now traders will focus on the main event which is tomorrow\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll release. Early expectations were for an increase of just over 200,000. But the \u201cwhisper number\u201d will probably be well below that following yesterday\u2019s grim ADP number. Today\u2019s jobless claims together with a worse than expected Challenger Job-cut number haven\u2019t helped either. More US employment data ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm numbers. After a jump in the number of US workers laid off last month it is probably no surprise that jobless claims rose last week. According to the Labor department the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 to 274,000, the largest increase since February of last year. Analysts had expected a figure of around 260,000. Donald Trump also says he\u2019d scrap a swathe of federal regulations which are (he argues) holding back US firms. He told CNBC: \u201cWe\u2019re lowering taxes very substantially and we\u2019re going to be getting rid of a tremendous amount of regulations.\u201d With the Republican nomination in the bag, Donald Trump is now turning his attention to how he\u2019d run the American economy if he makes it to the White House. And he\u2019s just declared that he would probably replace Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve when her current term expires. Yellen\u2019s crime? Not being a Republican, apparently. Speaking to CNBC, Trump declared: I have nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever. She\u2019s been doing her job, and I have absolutely nothing against her. I don\u2019t know her, but she\u2019s a very capable person and people that I know have a very high regard for her. But she\u2019s not a Republican\u2026 When her time is up, I would most likely replace her because of the fact that it would be appropriate. But in a typical piece of Trump logic, the billionaire businessman also backed Yellen\u2019s monetary policy stance: She\u2019s a low interest-rate person, she\u2019s always been a low interest-rate person \u2026and I must be honest, I\u2019m a low interest rate person. If we raise interest rates, and the dollar starts getting too strong, we\u2019re going to have some very major problems. Yellen\u2019s current four-year term expires in February 2018, but she could potentially serve a second term (as did her predecessor, Ben Bernanke). Bloomberg\u2019s Jon Ferro questions Trump\u2019s logic on this one: You can watch a clip of the interview here. We also have worrying news from America. The number of US workers laid off last month jumped, and hit the highest level for an April in seven years. It indicates American companies are feeling the pinch, after its economy slowed to virtual stagnation in the first quarter of 2016. Reuters has the details: Layoffs by U.S.-based companies accelerated in April, sending year-to-date job cuts to the highest level since 2009, a private study reported Thursday. Domestic companies announced plans to let go 65,141 workers last month, a 35 percent increase from March, according to the report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas . In the first four months of the year, employers said they would hand out 250,061 pink slips. That is the highest total for the January-to-April period since 2009. \u201cWe continue to see large scale layoffs in the energy sector, where low oil prices are driving down profits. However, we are also seeing heavy downsizing activity in other areas, such as computers and retail, where changing consumer trends are creating a lot of volatility,\u201d Challenger CEO John A. Challenger said in a statement. Meanwhile in London, the boss of consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has apologised over a humidifier steriliser scandal that has claimed around 100 lives. Julia Kollewe reports: Rakesh Kapoor, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser told shareholders at an AGM in central London: \u201cI\u2019m personally very sorry and very much regret that our Oxy product caused harm to people in Korea.\u201d He said the company had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and vowed to ensure that \u201csomething like this never happens again\u201d. He will meet representatives from one patient group, who were demonstrating outside the AGM, in his office on Friday. The humidifier steriliser is believed to have killed nearly 100 people and injured others. It was invented in Korea and only sold there. Reckitt acquired the firm that made the steriliser in 2001. Some of these products were also manufactured by rival companies. Kapoor\u2019s comments come three days after the head of Reckitt Benckiser Korea and Japan was struck while apologising for the scandal. James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, fears the Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from more than the Brexit jitters. Sproule warns: \u201cThese figures will be put down to uncertainty over the EU referendum, but while this may explain part of the fall, we should also consider whether there are underlying factors feeding into a less rosy economic picture. \u201cThe question we must ask is whether growth is built on solid foundations. My concern is that the exceptional period we are living in of low rates and cheap money is not the basis of a sustainable economy. We do not know what the outcome of the referendum will be, or the exact effects on the economy in the short and longer term, but this uncertainty is not an excuse to take our eye off the ball on more fundamental issues of economic sustainability.\u201d And this chart, from the Indie\u2019s Ben Chu, underlines how worrying this week\u2019s data is: With Britain\u2019s economy seemingly slowing, there\u2019s even less chance of the Bank of England raising interest rates in the next few months. Some economists are even speculating that the BoE could cut rates this year. And Chris Williamson of data firm Markit has confirmed that the Bank has previously eased monetary policy when its PMI readings have been this week. This graph plots Markit\u2019s PMI (dark blue) against interest rate cuts (light blue) and bouts of quantitative easing (grey). Williamson says: The three Markit/CIPS PMI surveys collectively indicated the weakest rate of expansion since March 2013, with growth slowing across the board. The combined Output Index fell from 53.6 in March to 51.9 in April. The latest reading is consistent with a near-stalling of economic growth, down to just 0.1% in April. The deterioration in April pushes the surveys into territory which has in the past seen the Bank of England start to worry about the need to revive growth, either by cutting interest rates or non-standard measures such as quantitative easing. This chart shows why the weak service sector data probably show that UK growth has slowed sharply. It\u2019s from German bank Berenberg. Their economist Kallum Pickering, says there are \u201csubstantial downside risks\u201d to UK growth, but.. If, as we expect, the UK votes to remain in the EU, then the growth rate should recover to its trend rate of 0.5% qoq in the second half of the year. While there are some risks relating to the current account deficit and concerns that households are returning to pre-Lehman borrowing and saving habits, underlying fundamentals are sound. Anthony Cheung of City firm Amplify Trading agrees that the UK economic picture has deteriorated: Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, agrees that Britain\u2019s economy appears to have weakened in April. And that means growth in the current quarter will be lower than in January-March, when GDP expanded by only 0.4%. Turner says: Uncertainty over the EU Referendum is clearly taking its toll on activity and with this backdrop, we expect second quarter GDP growth to dip below the already disappointing first quarter print. With such subdued levels of growth, we expect the Bank of England will hold fire on interest rates in next week\u2019s MPC meeting, and for many months thereafter.\u201d Britain\u2019s services sector makes up around three-quarters of the economy, so this slowdown is pretty worrying. David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says June\u2019s EU referendum is partly to blame. \u201cThe UK\u2019s services sector is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Mounting global economic uncertainty at the top of the supply chain and the reality of the new National Living Wage at the bottom mean that firms are feeling the pinch from both ends. As a result, the sector credited with being the main driver of the UK\u2019s economic fortunes appears to be slowing down. \u201cThe looming EU referendum has had a profound effect on the sector, keeping prices relatively stagnant and delaying new orders. At the other end of the supply chain, the National Living Wage has compounded cost increases, resulting in the overall rate of input price inflation hitting a 27-month high. Together, these factors have squeezed margins while fewer than half of businesses expect to grow over the next twelve months. Breaking: Britain\u2019s service sector\u2019s growth has slumped to its lowest level in three years. Markit, the data firm, says its service sector PMI has fallen to 52.3 in April, down from 53.7 in March. That\u2019s the weakest level since February 2013, and close to the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Firms reported that job creation slowed last month, while business optimism has fallen to a three year low too. This makes a hat-trick of bad UK economic news this week. Construction firms reported yesterday that growth has hit a three-year low, while the factory PMI showed that manufacturing is now contacting. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears that UK economic growth almost stalled last month: \u201cThe slowdown in the service sector follows similar weakness in manufacturing and construction to make a triple-whammy of disappointing news on the health of the economy at the start of the second quarter. \u201cThe PMI surveys are collectively indicating a near- stalling of economic growth, down from 0.4% in the first quarter to just 0.1% in April. \u201cSome of the slowdown may be attributable to the early timing of Easter, though April also saw an increase in the number of companies reporting that uncertainty about the EU referendum caused customers to hold back on purchases, exacerbating already-weak demand linked to global growth jitters and ongoing government spending cuts. More to follow.... Here we go..... Lets see if those forecasts of a small slowdown are accurate. As well as posting stronger profits, BT has announced a \u00a36bn investment in broadband and 4G coverage: You can now buy shares in Britain\u2019s luxury chocolate firm, Hotel Chocolat. The company floated on the stock market this morning, raising \u00a320m each for its two founders. The IPO will also yield \u00a312m to fund new store openings, as its expansion drive continues. Launching a new print newspaper, in this time of digital revolution, was always a risky move. So you can understand why Trinity Mirror is pulling its latest offering, The New Day, after seeing sales falling to 30,000. But the speed of the move is a shock \u2013 the paper only launched 9 weeks ago. The news broke last night (here\u2019s Mark Sweney\u2019s piece), and Trinity has confirmed it to shareholders this morning, saying: Although The New Day has received many supportive reviews and built a strong following on Facebook, the circulation for the title is below our expectations. As a result, we have decided to close the title on 6 May 2016. Whilst disappointing, the launch and subsequent closure have provided new insights into enhancing our newspapers and a number of these opportunities will be considered over time. But that\u2019s not the only bad news. Trinity has also revealed that revenues from print advertising has fall almost 20% - highlighting the tough conditions across media.... Europe\u2019s stock markets have made a nervous start to trading, after two days of losses. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is up 15 points, or 0.2%, while Germany\u2019s DAX is up 0.3% and the French CAC is flat. BT is leading the London risers, up 3%, after reporting a 5% jump in underlying earnings this morning. Supermarket group Morrisons has gained 1.7%; after a troubled time, it posted a 0.7% rise in underlying sales this morning. It also reported that Amazon is about to start supplying its customers with Morrisons\u2019 products, though a deal announced recently. Energy firm Centrica, though, has slumped by 7% after it announced plans to sell around \u00a3770m of new shares to cut its debt pile. Turkey\u2019s stock markets has plunged by 2% at the start of trading, as investors react to the country\u2019s latest political crisis. Investors are alarmed by reports that prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flo is poised to resign, following a power struggle with president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The Turkish lira is also suffering, shedding 5% overnight. Davuto\u011flo and Erdo\u011fan held crunch talks last night, but failed to mend their disagreements over key areas such as economic policy. Local reports suggest that elections for a new party leader to replace Davuto\u011flo could soon be called, causing fresh instability at a time when Turkey is already grappling with high inflation and the refugee crisis. Anxiety over a possible global downturn has hit stock markets in Asia again. The Hong Kong, South Korea and Philippines markets all shed around 0.5%. This send stocks across the region down for the seventh day running, its longest losing streak of the year Sharon Zollner of ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd explains that signs of economic slowdown is hurting confidence again: Markets seem to be at something of a crossroads at present, waiting for clearer signals on whether U.S. activity will bounce back in the second quarter,\u201d. \u201cIf the global economy were to tip into recession at some point, what ammo, precisely, do central banks have left that won\u2019t do more harm than good?\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. So far this week, the UK economic data has been quite disappointing. Construction firms are growing at the slowest rate in three years, and activity across Britain\u2019s manufacturers is actually shrinking again. And investors are worried that the service sector, which makes up around 80% of the economy, may also be weakening. At 9.30am, the latest Service Sector PMI hits the wires, and it may show that growth slowed in April. A bad reading will surely reinforce concerns that the UK economy is running out of steam, with the Brexit referendum of 23 June casting a darker shadow over the country. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson has the details: Both manufacturing and construction PMI\u2019s came in short of expectations with manufacturing slipping into contraction territory for the first time since early 2013. Given how important the services sector is to the UK economy we really need to see a decent number here or run the risk that we see a growth downgrade next week from the latest Bank of England inflation report. Expectations are for a slight decline to 53.6 from 53.7. After two days of heavy falls, European stock markets are expected to inch higher this morning. But there\u2019s still plenty of angst about global growth prospects, and recent fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets. And on the corporate front, we\u2019re getting results from telecoms firms BT, supermarket chain Morrisons, and newspaper group Trinity Mirror.",

If we can take the latest GDP data at face value, then the first quarter of 2016 saw US activity slide to an almost standstill. Yet, the labour market continues to fare well and was the one bright spot amid a general soft patch last month</p> <p>Over time, activity and labour data are likely to converge, but right now there is little evidence to untangle how this will play out. Were the April jobs figures to come in on a softer note, then this would endorse the weakness in activity and imply that lagging variables such as employment are also now turning lower. Conversely, if the labour data stays resilient then we will further linger in a state of limbo as either it is the activity data that is the aberration or the lags have yet to kick in. The April jobs report may in fact accentuate the stagflationary trends (soft activity, rising inflation) noted of late:</p> <p><strong>Payrolls to come in a tad softer than expectations</strong> (ING: +190,000; consensus: +200,000). While some indicators continue to signal a robust hiring backdrop, the softer ADP print suggests that there are some (albeit marginal) downside risks to jobs growth in April. </p> <p><strong>Upward bias in the unemployment rate still in place</strong> (ING: 5.0%; consensus: 4.9%). The discrepancy between payrolls and the household survey (from which the unemployment rate rate is derived) is still evident, while the very strong labour force growth is unlikely to endure. A slight correction in both components may put some upward pressure on the unemployment rate.</p> <p><strong>Robust underlying wage pressures should result in decent headline wage growth </strong>(ING: 2.4% year on year; consensus 2.4%). We note that the headline AHE measure has been hovering at the lower end of a range of US wage indicators, with the Atlanta Fed\u2019s wage growth tracker continuing to tick higher (on a moving average basis). Thus, we think the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher this month.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-05T15:07:26.095Z\">at 4.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-572b53e7e4b0d509448a6423\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-05T14:13:07.499Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks rise by more than forecast</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude stocks increased by a higher than expected 2.8m barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p> <p>Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.7m barrels.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest care home operator, Four Seasons Health Care, is running out of cash and is likely to be taken over by its creditors, the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned. Four Seasons has 440 care homes with 18,500 residents, but Moody\u2019s said its financial position was unsustainable. Last week, the company reported an annual pre-tax loss of \u00a3264m after writing down the value of the care homes it owns by a third due to the pressure on the industry. Four Seasons is also struggling under the weight of more than \u00a3500m of debt, making interest payments of \u00a352.1m last year. Tim Snow, a senior analyst at Moody\u2019s, warned the outlook for the group was opaque because the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d (NLW) has led to an increase in costs and it is not clear whether councils will help to fund this by increasing the fees they pay towards residents\u2019 care. He said profit growth over the next two years would not be substantial and was \u201csubject to vulnerabilities\u201d and that Four Seasons\u2019 ability to raise money by selling off property was diminishing. As a result, Moody\u2019s said, the company \u201cwill not be able to service material levels of cash to pay debt going forward\u201d and a debt-for-equity swap with lenders was the most likely outcome. Four Seasons\u2019 lenders include US investment firms HCP and H/2 Capital Partners. The company hit back at the dire warning, insisting it has \u201cmedium-term flexibility\u201d in its finances, with auditors signing off the accounts last week as a going concern. Robbie Barr, the chairman, said the quality of care in the company\u2019s homes had not been affected by financial pressures \u2013 with three homes blocked from taking new residents by the regulator compared with a peak of 28. However, Barr admitted that Four Seasons needed to restructure its finances. Four Seasons is at the forefront of the funding crisis facing the care home industry. Care homes are being squeezed by a decline in the fees that cash-strapped local authorities pay towards residents\u2019 care and a rise in staff costs caused by the introduction of the \u00a37.20 an hour NLW, which came into force on 1 April. The chancellor, George Osborne, has allowed councils to increase council tax by an extra 2% a year to help fund social care, and more than 90% of local authorities have introduced the levy by the maximum amount. However, Moody\u2019s warned these funds may not fill the financial shortfall facing care homes. Snow said: \u201cEven though we understand that over 90% of local authorities have opted to implement the full 2% increase in 2016/17, it remains unclear both how this additional funding will be spent and to what extent the full precept will be raised in future years. \u201cAt the same time, we do not believe that there is significant scope to recover the effective underfunding of fee settlements from previous years and we do not therefore foresee a material positive transformation in [profits] performance over the next 12 to 24 months. \u201cWe also believe that against the backdrop of an industry-wide shortage of permanently employed nurses there are further vulnerabilities associated with reliance on agency staff and wage costs more generally, albeit that we acknowledge the progress made around agency personnel.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Americans may soon be able to bring class action lawsuits against banks and other financial firms thanks to a new rule proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The new proposals will allow Americans to band together and sue over a range of products such as credit cards, checking and savings accounts, money transfer services, and auto and student loans. Financial firms have over the years perfected the use of fine print to prohibit consumers from bringing such lawsuits and instead force them into arbitrations, which can be costly for an individual consumer. The rule introduced by CFPB on Thursday would prohibit such mandatory arbitration clauses to be used on financial products. \u201cSigning up for a credit card or opening a bank account can often mean signing away your right to take the company to court if things go wrong,\u201d said Richard Cordray, CFPB director, said in a statement. \u201cMany banks and financial companies avoid accountability by putting arbitration clauses in their contracts that block groups of their customers from suing them. Our proposal seeks comment on whether to ban this contract \u2018gotcha\u2019 that effectively denies groups of consumers the right to seek justice and relief for wrongdoing.\u201d The proposed rule does not require congressional approval, but will be open to public for a 90-day comment period. Once finalized, the rule is expected to go into effect next year. It will not apply retroactively to existing accounts or products signed up for by consumers prior to its implementation. Financial institutions came out against the new rule. \u201cThe proposed rule is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing,\u201d the US Chamber of Commerce said in a statement. \u201cNow the agency designed to protect consumers is proposing a rule that will end up hurting them.\u201d Critics of the proposed rule argue that instead of benefiting consumers, it would result in profits for class action lawyers and stretch out resolution of consumer disputes. In a letter to the CFPB, the Chamber of Commerce described arbitration as \u201ccheaper, faster and more effective at delivering relief to consumers\u201d. Class action lawsuits will benefit consumers who would not usually pursue legal action to resolve a small-dollar dispute, CFPB noted in its statement. \u201cThe proposed rules would allow groups of consumers to obtain relief when companies skirt the law. Most consumers do not even realize when their rights have been violated,\u201d it read. \u201cOften the harm may be too small to make it practical for a single consumer to pursue an individual dispute, even when the cumulative harm to all affected consumers is significant.\u201d In a 2015 survey, CFPB found that just 2% of consumers would consult a lawyer or pursue legal action to resolve small disputes. A New York Times investigation revealed that from 2010-2014, only 505 consumers chose to enter arbitration over disputes of $2,500 or less.",

It will not apply retroactively to existing accounts or products signed up for by consumers prior to its implementation. </p> <p>Financial institutions came out against the new rule. </p> <p>\u201cThe proposed rule is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing,\u201d the US Chamber of Commerce said in a statement. \u201cNow the agency designed to protect consumers is proposing a rule that will end up hurting them.\u201d</p> <p>Critics of the proposed rule argue that instead of benefiting consumers, it would result in profits for class action lawyers and stretch out resolution of consumer disputes. In a letter to the CFPB, the Chamber of Commerce described arbitration as \u201ccheaper, faster and more effective at delivering relief to consumers\u201d.</p> <p>Class action lawsuits will benefit consumers who would not usually pursue legal action to resolve a small-dollar dispute, CFPB noted in its statement. </p> <p>\u201cThe proposed rules would allow groups of consumers to obtain relief when companies skirt the law. Most consumers do not even realize when their rights have been violated,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-proposes-prohibiting-mandatory-arbitration-clauses-deny-groups-consumers-their-day-court/\">it read</a>. \u201cOften the harm may be too small to make it practical for a single consumer to pursue an individual dispute, even when the cumulative harm to all affected consumers is significant.\u201d</p> <p>In a 2015 survey, CFPB found that just 2% of consumers would consult a lawyer or pursue legal action to resolve small disputes. A <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/business/dealbook/consumer-agency-moves-to-assert-bank-customers-right-to-sue.html?_r=0\">New York Times investigation</a> revealed that from 2010-2014, only 505 consumers chose to enter arbitration over disputes of $2,500 or less. </p>",

The Medway secure training centre, which has been run by G4S since it opened in 1998, is to be taken over by the National Offender Management Service, which runs public sector prisons and probation services. The decision, due to be announced next week, comes in advance of publication of an improvement board report for justice ministers that was expected to be published later this month detailing the future options for the child jail. Four members of staff were arrested on charges of child neglect after undercover filming exposed staff appearing to use excessive force to restrain youngsters, children being bullied by staff and officers lying when reporting incidents. The private security firm announced in February in the wake of the allegations that it was selling its UK children\u2019s services business including two secure training centres, at Medway and Oakhill, and 13 children\u2019s homes. G4S\u2019s existing contract to run Medway had been extended to July while the improvement board reported to justice ministers. The Ministry of Justice confirmed in April that G4S would not be taking on the new contract to run Medway that it had previously been awarded. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cOur priority will always be the safety and welfare of young people in custody \u2013 that is why the justice secretary set up an independent improvement board to examine the running of Medway STC. This sits alongside a wider review of youth justice, led by Charlie Taylor. \u201cWe are considering a range of options and will announce the next steps in due course.\u201d A G4S spokesman said: \u201cThe behaviour of some of our staff at Medway revealed in January was completely unacceptable.

Some 61,582 people lost their jobs between 1 April and 30 April, according to employer announcements of staff reductions polled by analysts. For the first third of the year, cuts are at more than 250,000, a level not reached since the recession hit the job market in earnest in early 2009 and cost nearly 700,000 people their jobs. The news comes amid worrying signs of a slowdown in the pace of the jobs market\u2019s recovery. This week payroll processor ADP said the US had added only 156,000 jobs in April, gains that were down against the previous month and offset by increasingly grim news from energy and tech sectors. Much of the recent job losses have been related to the oil industry, hit by the collapse of the oil price. Challenger found that energy\u2019s woes are a continuing problem, but April was marked by major cuts from Intel, which slashed its employee ranks: nearly three-quarters of the 16,923 cuts in the sector were the result of the chip-maker\u2019s 12,000 layoffs. There are rumored cuts from the tech sector that are not included in the report, as well: IBM is said to have laid of 14,000, but because the company has not confirmed the dismissals, Challenger Gray doesn\u2019t track them.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "International oil companies such as Shell and BP must completely change their business model or face a \u201cnasty, brutish and short\u201d end within 10 years, one of Britain\u2019s most influential energy experts has warned. Paul Stephens, a fellow at Chatham House thinktank, said in a research paper the oil \u201cmajors\u201d were no longer fit for purpose \u2013 hit by low crude prices, tightening climate change regulations and their own wrongheaded strategies. In the report, Stephens argues the only way forward for the companies lies in diversifying into green energy, drastically reducing their operations or consolidating through mega-mergers. \u201cThe prognosis for the IOCs [international oil companies] was already grim before governments became serious about climate change and the oil price collapsed \u2026 their old business model is dying,\u201d said Stephens, a visiting professor at University College London. \u201cIn this new world, the only realistic option \u2026 lies in restructuring and realising (selling) many of their current assets to provide cash for their shareholders.\u201d The death of these key fossil fuel providers would be an astonishing reversal in fortunes for powerful companies that have previously been accused of being climate change deniers and tools \u2013 if not makers \u2013 of foreign policy. The companies, increasingly facing calls from many of their shareholders to take more account of the environment, have also been stalwarts of the London stock market and important providers of dividends for British pension funds. Stephens believes the companies have spent too much time trying to maximise shareholder value by finding and proving more reserves while outsourcing key operations. The collapse in crude to $45 per barrel has exacerbated problems for the industry, but the Chatham House expert says a major price recovery cannot be guaranteed. He says companies have 10 years to change strategy or die. \u201cThis means inevitably, however, that they must shrink into the remaining areas, functionally and geographically, where they can earn an acceptable return. \u201cThis requires a major change in the corporate culture of the IOCs. It remains to be seen whether their senior management can manage such a fundamental shift. If they can, then the IOCs will be able to slip into a gentle decline but ultimately survive, albeit on a much smaller scale. If they do not change their business model, what remains of their existence will be nasty, brutish and short.\u201d The call for a shakeup comes less than 24 hours after another thinktank, the Carbon Tracker Initiative, also called on oil companies to slim down and base their business models around global warming targets. The big oil companies, including US firms such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have been warned that they are presiding over \u201cstranded assets\u201d of carbon that can never be burned if the world is determined to keep average temperatures from rising no more than 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels. But the future of international climate change strategies, and therefore carbon emissions, will depend to a great extent on whether countries implement the necessary policies agreed at the UN talks in Paris last December. A range of issues could influence this, not least whether America elects a president this year who is as committed to the low-carbon agenda as Barack Obama. Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, may not be. Stephens said he had assumed the Paris agreement \u2013 known as COP21 \u2013 would be implemented, allowing the world to move slowly but surely into a new lower-carbon phase. There are isolated signs of companies taking action to change their business model, with Shell merging with its rival BG and pulling back from high-cost and environmentally challenging drilling in the Alaskan Arctic. The Chatham House expert notes that the influence of the international oil companies has waned since the 25 years following the second world war, when they controlled virtually all crude production outside of the US and communist states. They also owned \u201c70% of all refining capacity, every important pipeline and about two-thirds of the privately owned tanker fleet. In this period, international crude oil trade moved entirely within their integrated operations or through long-term contracts between them.\u201d This article was amended on 9 May 2016.

      "bodyText": "Last summer the UK economy was zipping along and the chancellor, fresh from an election victory, was boasting of the best GDP growth in the G7. Inside the Treasury, it was unthinkable that growth would evaporate within a year, and yet this week\u2019s surveys of the construction, manufacturing and services industries, which cover just about all economic activity, show output flattening going into the second quarter. Worse, job creation is at its lowest for more than two and a half years and business optimism has fallen to a level not seen since the start of 2013. In recent weeks the chancellor has blamed Brexit; before that the \u201ccocktail of threats\u201d from the global slowdown in trade. It might suit him to argue that forces beyond his control are damaging growth. And there is some truth that the deteriorating situation in China, the US and the sickly eurozone have played a part in depressing national incomes alongside the impact of the impending EU referendum, which has encouraged businesses to defer investment. But bodies such as the British Chambers of Commerce have charted weakening business confidence for almost a year. Manufacturing activity started to slide in the summer of 2015 and construction followed not far behind. So the deterioration goes back further than September\u2019s stock market panic, which was triggered by terrible trade figures from China and spurred George Osborne to make his \u201ccocktail of threats\u201d speech. And it long predates fears of a Brexit vote. There is the possibility the chancellor is to blame, after he swept back into No 11 promising a further five years of austerity. Never before has the UK sustained 10 years of restrained, if not shrinking, government expenditure. Without the multiplier effect of public spending on new infrastructure and cash to maintain the existing roads and public amenities, the private sector has pulled in its horns. Another reason could be that businesses have reached the end of the road with their post-financial crash strategy of employing ever more cheap labour to operate increasingly outdated kit and outmoded practices. They need to upgrade and improve worker skills, but uncertainty prevents them taking the plunge. In this they are not alone. It is the same story of weak business investment across the entire developed world. And only bolder support from government will persuade them that a three- to five-year investment horizon has a payback and will not end in disaster. Even the CBI has spotted the problem and says government needs to play a bigger part, calling for a new industrial strategy.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The alternative, cheaper scheme to expand Heathrow airport should be put back on the table if the government gives the go-ahead for a new runway, according to the boss of British Airways\u2019 owner. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, whose airlines, including BA, operate the majority of services at Heathrow, said he did not expect a decision soon \u2013 but the \u201cprohibitive costs\u201d meant ministers should not be bound to the airport\u2019s own proposals for a third, north-west runway. The Airports Commission gave a clear recommendation in 2015 to go ahead with Heathrow\u2019s official scheme rather than the independent hub proposal, which would double the length of the existing northern runway to allow landing and takeoff on the same strip. However, the Heathrow hub was shortlisted as a viable proposition in the commission\u2019s interim report alongside a second runway at Gatwick, an option that the government said it is still considering. Walsh said that it was an \u201cinteresting concept\u201d, adding: \u201cIf you look at Heathrow you\u2019ve got to open your mind ... If it gets the nod you\u2019ve got to look seriously at both of the options.\u201d He said the hub proposal, developed by the former Concorde pilot Jock Lowe, would cost a \u201chell of a lot less\u201d than the \u00a323bn price \u2013 including new roads \u2013 that the commission estimated Heathrow\u2019s third runway plan would cost. Walsh said: \u201cI honestly can\u2019t see how you can spend that much money on an airport and not discourage people from flying there.\u201d Landing charges for airlines would go up significantly to finance the construction, according to the commission. Walsh added: \u201cWe have to look not only at whether the demand exists \u2013 which I believe it does \u2013 but whether you can match that demand with something that\u2019s affordable.\u201d He contrasted Heathrow\u2019s costs with a similar scheme in Dublin, the base of one of BA\u2019s sister airlines in IAG, Aer Lingus. \u201cThe airport is talking about building a second runway at a tiny fraction of the cost of the Heathrow third \u2013 \u00a3350m against \u00a323bn. \u201cIt gives us an attractive option to continue to grow on the transatlantic and serve cities in Britain and Europe that we won\u2019t be able to connect through Heathrow.\u201d The frontrunners in Thursday\u2019s London mayoral election, Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan and Conservative Zac Goldsmith, both oppose Heathrow expansion and back Gatwick. Walsh warned bluntly on Gatwick: \u201cI don\u2019t think the business case exists.\u201d He said most airlines only chose to operate at Gatwick if they could not get in to Heathrow, particularly on business routes. The IAG chief executive was speaking aboard British Airways\u2019 inaugural flight from Heathrow to San Jose in California \u2013 the first direct link from Europe to the airport closest to the Silicon Valley HQs of Apple, eBay, Google and other tech companies. \u2018I\u2019m not leaving IAG. This is my last job\u2019 Walsh insisted he will not be retiring imminently, despite previously having said he would be stepping down at 55 \u2013 an age he will reach in October. He said he was fitter than ever after a dramatic recent weight loss that he ascribed to kicking a 12-a-day cappuccino habit and turning to salads in the IAG office. Walsh said: \u201cAs a pilot, retirement age was 55. I was getting used to the idea. Now that I\u2019m approaching that age, I\u2019m realising that 55 is very, very young. \u201cI foolishly made those comments some time ago and I\u2019m never afraid to admit when I got it wrong. There\u2019s a lot more [to do]. I\u2019m not leaving IAG. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is my last job.\u201d",

The insurer said it was on track to at least meet analysts\u2019 forecast for its full year profits, as it stepped up cost cutting in the wake of a failed \u00a35.6bn bid from Zurich Insurance last year. The business has been concentrating on its core businesses in the UK and Ireland, Canada and Scandanavia, and has sold operations in Brazil, Russia and Argentina among others. Its first quarter results showed an 8% increase in premiums excluding discontinued businesses and a strong increase in operating profits, and Hester said: A streamlined and focused business model is already proving its worth...Higher profits are underpinned by better attitional loss ratios and falling costs as planned. But he added: The external environment is challenging, characterised by slow growth, competition and volatile financial markets. Hence our reliance on self-help as the route to a focused, stronger and better RSA. Charlie Huggins, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Stephen Hester\u2019s turnaround plan at RSA appears to be working. The balance sheet has been painstakingly restored, \u00a3180m of cost savings have already been delivered, with more to come. Following the sale of the Latin American business, the asset disposal programme is largely complete, meaning RSA is now a much more focused operation. The dividend has proved about as reliable as an English summer historically, but now looks more secure, given RSA\u2019s much stronger balance sheet position. These self-help measures have enabled RSA to overcome a very challenging operating environment. The increased cost saving guidance announced alongside full year results suggests there is still much to play for, underpinning analysts\u2019 forecasts for double-digit profit growth out to 2018. ...However, cost cutting cannot continue indefinitely without damaging the business, and we still struggle to get excited about RSA\u2019s long term prospects. Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said: RSA has issued a robust first quarter 2016 interim management statement with operating profits \u201cup strongly\u201d, benefiting from both benign weather and also the better attritional losses and reduced cost base arising from the recent restructuring. The quarter delivered better underwriting results across the UK, Scandinavia and Canada... We expect the shares to respond favourably to the overall tone and content of this IMS statement this morning. However, following a strong rally in the stock recently, we reiterate our hold recommendation on RSA, highlighting the near 55% premium to our 2016 forecast net tangible asset value of 300p and little income attractions in the short to medium term, at around 2.3% for 2016 (versus 11p).

      "bodyText": "A sharp slowdown in Britain\u2019s vast services sector, which covers everything from banking to hotels, has fanned fears that economic growth is stalling, hurt by a downturn in global trade and jitters ahead of June\u2019s knife-edge EU referendum. A closely watched survey of businesses in the UK\u2019s biggest sector showed activity slumped in April to its slowest pace for more than three years. That followed polls earlier in the week showing the smaller construction and manufacturing sectors had also lost momentum last month. The surveys\u2019 compilers, Markit, said that taken together the reports suggested economic growth stalled in April, dropping to an estimated 0.1%, from 0.4% growth in the first quarter of the year. That chimes with a Bank of England warning that the economy will likely lose steam as the in/out EU referendum nears and businesses delay investment decisions. Economists said the reports suggested the upcoming referendum was exacerbating an already fragile mood among businesses after a tumultuous start to 2016 on global markets. \u201cApril\u2019s Markit/CIPS report on services indicates that uncertainty emanating from the EU referendum has brought the recovery to its knees,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cWith the latest opinion polls still showing that support for leaving the EU is just as strong as support for staying in, the headwinds stemming from the referendum will only intensify over the next two months.\u201d The headline activity index on the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI poll dropped to 52.3 in April from 53.7 in March, the lowest reading since February 2013. That was still above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, but below expectations for 53.5 in a Reuters poll of economists taken before the report. The report also signalled the lowest rise in employment since August for the services sector, which spans hotels to the financial industry, including banks and insurers. Business optimism also weakened, echoing other reports that employers are nervous about the referendum result and deferring both hiring and spending as a result. Markit\u2019s construction PMI this week pointed to the slowest growth for almost three years as firms blamed a lack of new orders amid a weaker outlook for the UK economy. There was similarly downbeat news from manufacturers, which also suffered their worst month in three years as falling export orders and a lack of domestic demand for consumer goods squeezed output. Taken together the reports indicated the weakest rate of expansion for three years and were likely to put Bank of England policymakers on alert, said Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson. \u201cThe latest reading is consistent with a near-stalling of economic growth, down to just 0.1% in April,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deterioration in April pushes the surveys into territory which has in the past seen the Bank of England start to worry about the need to revive growth, either by cutting interest rates or non-standard measures such as quantitative easing.\u201d Interest rates have been at a record low of 0.5% for more than seven years and financial markets are not expecting the Bank to raise them until well into next year. Most economists expect the Bank would cut interest rates in the event of a vote to leave the EU. But some say a so-called Brexit could also prompt a rate rise if it knocks the pound down sharply against other currencies. Surveys suggest that the referendum itself is already impacting the UK economy, with consumer confidence measures down and business polls also noting worries. As such, Bank policymakers have made clear that they will treat pre-referendum news on the economy with more caution than usual. The PMI suggested optimism about the year ahead in the services sector fell to match a 33-month low seen in January. \u201cApril saw an increase in the number of companies reporting that uncertainty about the EU referendum caused customers to hold back on purchases, exacerbating already-weak demand linked to global growth jitters and ongoing government spending cuts,\u201d said Williamson. But there were few bright spots in the report on services, which covers some 80% of the UK economy. New business continued to grow, albeit it at a relatively slow pace. Employment also continued to rise but at the weakest pace in more than two-and-a-half years. Companies said the introduction of the National Living Wage last month drove up their costs, which rose at the fastest pace for 27 months. The services report marked yet another sign the economy was losing steam, said James Smith economist at the bank ING. The outlook for interest rates now largely depended on the outcome of the EU referendum, he added. \u201cShould the UK vote to remain in the EU, then it is likely that activity will rebound as sentiment recovers and delayed business investment and employment plans are implemented. However, the jury is still out on whether the recent economic weakness is entirely attributable to vote-related weakness, so the actual timing of the first rate hike depends on the speed and magnitude of recovery in the UK data post-referendum,\u201d said Smith. \u201cShould the UK vote to leave the EU, then the potential for weaker business sentiment could prompt the BoE to loosen policy to pre-empt any near-term economic weakness.\u201d",

As such, Bank policymakers have made clear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bank-of-england-warns-brexit-could-do-serious-harm-to-uk-economy\">they will treat pre-referendum news on the economy with more caution than usual</a>.</p> <p>The PMI suggested optimism about the year ahead in the services sector fell to match a 33-month low seen in January.<br></p> <p>\u201cApril saw an increase in the number of companies reporting that uncertainty about the EU referendum caused customers to hold back on purchases, exacerbating already-weak demand linked to global growth jitters and ongoing government spending cuts,\u201d said Williamson.</p> <p>But there were few bright spots in the report on services, which covers some 80% of the UK economy. New business continued to grow, albeit it at a relatively slow pace. Employment also continued to rise but at the weakest pace in more than two-and-a-half years. Companies said the introduction of the National Living Wage last month drove up their costs, which rose at the fastest pace for 27 months.</p> <p>The services report marked yet another sign the economy was losing steam, said James Smith economist at the bank ING. The outlook for interest rates now largely depended on the outcome of the EU referendum, he added.<br></p> <p>\u201cShould the UK vote to remain in the EU, then it is likely that activity will rebound as sentiment recovers and delayed business investment and employment plans are implemented. However, the jury is still out on whether the recent economic weakness is entirely attributable to vote-related weakness, so the actual timing of the first rate hike depends on the speed and magnitude of recovery in the UK data post-referendum,\u201d said Smith.</p> <p>\u201cShould the UK vote to leave the EU, then the potential for weaker business sentiment could prompt the BoE to loosen policy to pre-empt any near-term economic weakness.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Home deliveries and strong sales of takeaway sandwiches have helped Morrisons achieve its second consecutive quarter of underlying growth after nearly four years of decline. The supermarket was one of the FTSE\u2019s biggest risers in Thursday morning trading after it said sales at stores open for more than a year, including its online store, rose 0.7% in the three months to 1 May. Online sales boosted that figure by 1% with sales in stores continuing to fall after Morrisons slashed prices by an average 2.6% to help fight off competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as major rivals such as Tesco and Asda. Shares rose by more than 2% on Thursday morning as investors were cheered by the news that the first quarterly growth in four years achieved in the previous three months was not a one-off. David Potts, who joined Morrisons a year ago as chief executive, said the trading update demonstrated that his efforts to stabilise trade at Morrisons were taking effect. \u201cThere is still much to do and our colleagues are working very hard to improve the shopping trip and save customers every penny we can. Customers are responding and satisfaction levels remain ahead of last year,\u201d he said. \u201cWord of mouth is very important and if the word on the street is that Mozzas is back on its feet and has found its sea legs again in quite a choppy market then that will spread,\u201d Potts added later. He said Morrisons had cut prices on more than 800 items in the last week and would continue to make cuts as customers appreciated it and bought more items. He said Morrisons was also improving its product range and service. \u201cWe will continue to do the work around this shopping trip. We are right at the start of this journey,\u201d he said. The chain was also boosted in the first quarter by new and improved products within its Food to Go range of sandwiches, salads, sushi and snacks, where sales were 17% higher than the same period a year earlier. Its new self-service and express checkouts encouraged customers to shop more often and spend less time queuing, Morrisons said, and contributed to a 2.8% fall in items per basket. Sales of the chain\u2019s Nutmeg clothing range rose 25% in established stores and Potts plans to put it in all Morrisons stores by early next year. Total sales fell 1.8% over the first quarter as the retailer sold off its convenience store business and closed several unprofitable supermarkets. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein, said Morrisons would continue to be hit by the need to cut prices in order to stay competitive after store closures. \u201cIt is trying to shrink to greatness. These results may get the market excited temporarily, but we should focus on the line \u2018there is still much to do\u2019,\u201d Monteyne said. Morrisons is attempting to simplify the business following a tough period of competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. It is also benefiting from a belated move online via a partnership with Ocado, which it is currently in negotiations to expand. Morrisons announced in February that it would make fresh and frozen food available on Amazon as well as via its own website. Potts said Morrisons expected its ranges to be available via the Amazon Pantry service \u201cimminently\u201d. It has already supplied 800 separate product lines \u2013 all tinned and packaged groceries \u2013 to the online retailer. The company is also hoping to expand the wholesale of its own-label foods through its tie-in with petrol station operator Motor Fuel Group, which is currently operating in five stores.",

Before its annual meeting in Nottingham on Thursday, the British company, which makes engines for aircraft and ships, stuck to its full-year outlook after issuing five profit warnings in less than two years. The first six months of this year are expected to be \u201cclose to break-even\u201d. Rolls-Royce expects business to pick up in the second half due to increased large engine deliveries, good revenue growth in servicing engines and benefits from its restructuring programmes. Last year, it made two-thirds of its profits in the second half and this year profits will be weighted even more heavily towards that period. Analysts expect 2016 pre-tax profits to halve from last year to \u00a3671m, according to the company (pdf). Rolls-Royce has been hit by falling demand for corporate jets in emerging markets, cuts to defence budgets and plunging oil prices that have prompted energy companies to scale back investment plans. Reiterating comments he made in February, East said: \u201cDespite steady market conditions for most of our businesses, 2016 continues to be a challenging year overall as we sustain investment and start to transition major products in civil aerospace, and tackle weak markets in marine.\u201d Rolls-Royce, which manufactures engines for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbos, said it was \u201cwell on track\u201d to deliver the expected cost savings of \u00a330-\u00a350m this year. The restructuring programmes in civil aerospace, defence aerospace and its marine division are also on track, including plans to revamp its factory in Indianapolis in the US in the second half of the year. The Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said: \u201cIn the last two months, things had gone quiet around Rolls-Royce. We do not see why today\u2019s update should disturb the peace.\u201d The group recently announced plans to hire 350 people at its factory in Derby to assemble its Trent XWB engine \u2013 welcome news after a big wave of job cuts totalling 2,600 in November 2014 that mostly affected Derby and Bristol. The US activist investor ValueAct has built a near 11% stake in Rolls-Royce, becoming its biggest shareholder, and has been given a seat on the board.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT, under pressure from rivals and regulator Ofcom, is to invest \u00a36bn in improving its services, including extending superfast broadband and 4G coverage to more than 95% of the UK by 2020. The UK\u2019s largest telecoms firm laid out its investment plans on Thursday as it reported a 15% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a33bn for the year to 31 March, helped by stronger demand for its broadband and TV bundles. At least 10m homes and businesses are to get ultrafast broadband through a combination of fibre and copper technology called G.fast, with an ambition to reach 12m. The group is laying even faster fibre-optic broadband lines (called fibre to the premises or FTTP) to 2m customers who want speeds of up to 1Gbps, mainly in new housing developments, high streets and business parks. BT is also investing in customer service, and pledged within a year to halve the number of missed appointments at its broadband infrastructure division Openreach. It vowed to reduce the time taken to fix line faults by 24 hours as well as handling 90% of customers\u2019 calls in the UK by March 2017. Openreach is hiring 1,000 new engineers this year. Its head, Clive Selley, has promised customers \u201cbetter service, broader coverage and faster speeds\u201d. Earlier this year the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, stopped short of recommending that BT be forced to spin off Openreach, as demanded by rivals including TalkTalk and Sky. Instead, the regulator told BT to help rivals use its infrastructure to lay fibre cables that are faster than its own copper network, as part of a review of Britain\u2019s broadband needs. It also demanded that the company improve broadband services for businesses by installing high-speed business lines more quickly and significantly reducing the price it charges rivals for the lines. Analysts at Haitong Research said that despite BT\u2019s investment plans and \u201cOfcom helping rivals get easier access to BT\u2019s ducts and poles, we doubt that new large-scale networks will be built\u201d. Rival Sky was not impressed. Andrew Griffith, its chief operating officer and chief financial officer, said: \u201dToday\u2019s statement shows that BT continues to see copper as the basis of its network for 21st-century Britain. Despite BT\u2019s claims, it is clearer than ever that their plans for fibre to the premise (FTTP) broadband will bypass almost every existing UK home. \u201cThis limited ambition has been dragged out of BT by the threat of regulatory action, demonstrating once again why an independent Openreach, free to raise its own long-term capital, is the best way for the UK to get the fibre network it needs.\u201d BT\u2019s \u00a312.5bn acquisition of EE, Britain\u2019s largest mobile phone network, was sanctioned by regulators in January. The company said the integration of the mobile operator was going well. Its consumer business, which supplies broadband, telephone and TV services, posted an 8% rise in full-year sales to \u00a31.2bn, as the number of TV customers grew 28% to 1.5m. BT Sport audiences are up 45%, thanks to its live coverage of Uefa Champions League and Europa League matches. Openreach posted 415,000 fibre broadband net additions, and together BT and EE now control 81% of the market. BT\u2019s chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said: \u201cThe UK is a digital leader today and it is vital that it remains one in the future \u2026 Networks require money and a lot of it. Virgin and BT have both pledged to invest and we will now see if others follow our lead.\u201d He added: \u201cCustomers want their broadband to be affordable as well as fast and we will be able to do that using G.fast.\u201d",

It vowed to reduce the time taken to fix line faults by 24 hours as well as handling 90% of customers\u2019 calls in the UK by March 2017.</p> <p>Openreach is hiring 1,000 new engineers this year. Its head, Clive Selley, has promised customers \u201cbetter service, broader coverage and faster speeds\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this year the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, stopped short of recommending that BT be forced to spin off Openreach, as demanded by rivals including TalkTalk and Sky.</p> <p>Instead, the regulator told BT to help rivals use its infrastructure to lay fibre cables that are faster than its own copper network, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/bt-should-let-rivals-use-infrastructure-to-lay-faster-broadband-cables-ofcom-says\">as part of a review of Britain\u2019s broadband needs</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/22/bt-must-install-business-broadband-more-quickly-ofcom-says\">It also demanded that the company improve broadband services for businesses</a> by installing high-speed business lines more quickly and significantly reducing the price it charges rivals for the lines.</p> <p>Analysts at Haitong Research said that despite BT\u2019s investment plans and \u201cOfcom helping rivals get easier access to BT\u2019s ducts and poles, we doubt that new large-scale networks will be built\u201d.</p> <p>Rival Sky was not impressed. Andrew Griffith, its chief operating officer and chief financial officer, said: \u201dToday\u2019s statement shows that BT continues to see copper as the basis of its network for 21st-century Britain. Despite BT\u2019s claims, it is clearer than ever that their plans for fibre to the premise (FTTP) broadband will bypass almost every existing UK home.</p> <p>\u201cThis limited ambition has been dragged out of BT by the threat of regulatory action, demonstrating once again why an independent Openreach, free to raise its own long-term capital, is the best way for the UK to get the fibre network it needs.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/bt-ee-takeover-green-light-cma\">BT\u2019s \u00a312.5bn acquisition of EE, Britain\u2019s largest mobile phone network, was sanctioned by regulators in January</a>.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are edging higher after their recent tumble, but the moves are not convincing. And British Gas owner Centrica is missing out, dropping nearly 8% to 213.5p after it announced it planned to raise around \u00a3750m with a placing of 350m shares. It said the funds would be used to cut its debt mountain and also to pay for two acquisitions, energy management group Neas for \u00a3350m and another \u201ccustomer facing\u201d business worth around \u00a315om. It said low commodity prices and a challenging environment meant its credit ratings were under pressure, and it wanted to keep its high ratings. Analysts at Jefferies said: Centrica\u2019s two proposed acquisitions are in line with its strategy of strengthening its mid- and downstream operations. Raising a modest amount of equity to fund these acquisitions is understandable. Where there is some surprise with today\u2019s announcement is with the additional \u00a3400m being raised to pay down net debt. Raising equity is an expensive way of paying down debt. Nevertheless Centrica will clearly be in a modestly stronger financial position post the placing, albeit with existing shareholders facing a near 7% dilution. Centrica\u2019s new management have been trying to establish a reputation for tight capital management; it is difficult to say whether today\u2019s announcement enhances or diminishes that reputation. Angelos Anastasiou at Whitman Howard said: In a surprise move, Centrica has today announced that it is looking to issue around 7% of its equity in a placing. It says that the strategy is on track, but this will allow it to shore up its BBB+ credit rating in the weak commodities environment, while also allowing it to pay for two acquisitions with a combined value of \u00a3350m (Neas already announced for \u00a3200m and one to be confirmed soon for \u00a3150m). Today\u2019s move was not expected, but there does not appear to be any hidden warning in this statement, which reconfirms the guidance that was given in last month\u2019s trading update. So overall, we still believe that Iain Conn and his team are moving Centrica in the right direction. The yield on the final dividend is 3.5% in its own right, and the share will go ex of this on 12 May (payable 23 June). Overall the FTSE 100 is up 36.15 points at 6148.17, despite worse than expected UK service sector figures. Elsewhere there have been a raft of trading statements, issued to a mixed reception. Rolls-Royce is down 30.5p at 614.5p but Morrisons has jumped 7.3p to 194.8p and BT is 14.15p better at 453.65p following its figures. Greggs has gained 64p to \u00a311.12 while Tullow Oil has climbed 15.7p to 258p on this week\u2019s news that production had restarted at its Jubilee field off Ghana. A number of companies have gone ex-dividend including Kingfisher, down 5.6p at 356p, the London Stock Exchange, 31p lower at \u00a325.45 and BP, off 2.4p at 360.15p.",

      "bodyText": "The founders of Hotel Chocolat have each made more than \u00a320m after the chocolatier floated on the London stock exchange. Hotel Chocolat\u2019s placing valued the company at \u00a3167m, raising funds for the brand\u2019s expansion in the UK and online. The company, which has 81 shops in the UK, raised \u00a355.5m through its listing on the Alternative Investment Market, with shares valued at 148p. Trading will begin on 10 May. Of the \u00a355.5m raised from the share placing, \u00a312m will be used to speed up expansion plans, which include opening new shops and improving its website. Hotel Chocolat said it would also expand its Cambridgeshire chocolate factory, investing in new equipment and technologies and increasing production. The remaining \u00a343.5m will be split between founders Angus Thirlwell and Peter Harris, who retain a 66.6% stake in the company. Thirlwell, who is also chief executive, said the stock market listing was the beginning of \u201ca new chapter\u201d for Hotel Chocolat, a brand created in 2003 with the first shop opening in Watford, north of London, the following year. \u201cAnyone who knows me knows that I am not really motivated by money. On the [scale] of more pleasant and less pleasant it\u2019s more pleasant obviously but what excites me is building things and the fact that we have opened the door to chapter two of Hotel Chocolat. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue as major shareholder for a long time,\u201d Thirlwell added. It is a significant step for a retailer that has previously shunned the more traditional methods of raising capital, instead opting to issue \u201cchocolate bonds\u201d to customers. The chocolatier launched the scheme in 2010, and there are \u00a36.9m worth of chocolate bonds in issue. Bondholders are paid in chocolate, rather than cash dividends. Thirlwell said there was still a lot of untapped opportunity for the brand in the UK, with new Hotel Chocolat shops to open at a \u201csteady pace\u201d. It is also planning to expand its \u201cshop and cafe\u201d format. The latest shop and cafe opened in Cambridge, taking to the total to five. As well as opening new UK stores, the chocolate retailer will relocate some of its existing shops to larger, more prime sites, as well as refitting some stores. The company is also working on a new website, aiming to make it more compatible with mobiles and tablets. Thirlwell said: \u201cWe have clear plans to invest further in our British chocolate manufacturing operations, in new stores and in our digital offering. \u201cWe welcome our new shareholders and look forward with confidence to the next phase of our growth and development as a listed company. \u201cIt does feel like British chocolate is making a renaissance after being in the doldrums for a few decades.\u201d As well as its network of shops, Hotel Chocolat owns a cocoa plantation on St Lucia, which is home to a luxury hotel where a two-week stay costs up to \u00a310,000. It also has two UK restaurants, one in London\u2019s Borough Market and the other in Leeds. Hotel Chocolat has three shops in Copenhagen, Denmark, but Thirlwell said that UK growth would take priority over international expansion. Nick Bubb, an independent retailing analyst and consultant, said investors seemed to have \u201clapped up\u201d the placing, after the company announced the plans in March. Hotel Chocolat sales were \u00a382.6m in the year to 28 June 2015, while underlying profits were \u00a38.1m. The company said revenue increased 14% in the first half of the current financial year, while underlying profits were up 41%. The retailer said it intended to start paying dividends from its 2017 financial year onwards.",

      "bodyText": "Systemic criminal activity in the finance, insurance and real estate sectors has placed the livelihoods of consumers at risk, while authorities are aware but do nothing to stop it, a report from financial thinktank, LF Economics, says. The 52-page report tabled to the Senate inquiry into white-collar crime details evidence of widespread fraud committed by banks. The report uses research from an academic specialist in banking, financial and corporate fraud, Prof William Black, and banking and finance consumer rights advocate, Denise Brailey. It says that fraud within the finance and banking sectors occurs with the full knowledge of Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Reserve Bank of Australia. \u201cNone of these public organisations, however, have taken any meaningful action to identify, uphold the law and impose penalties on those engaged in white-collar criminality, let alone suggesting such penalties be increased,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe authorities know of these control frauds but refuse to act upon this knowledge; this is the first issue the inquiry must address.\u201d The major political parties had failed to take action to investigate or stamp out fraud and other crimes, the report says, adding that both the Coalition and Labor take campaign contributions from the sectors, \u201cwhich may explain their reluctance to investigate the allegations of control fraud\u201d. \u201cLong trails of victims are now left to fend for themselves, unassisted and blatantly ignored by regulators that should be striving to bring justice to these victims,\u201d the report says. Several examples of fraud are given. To hide the alleged fraud committed via service calculators and loan application forms, lenders have used a long, complex and opaque chain stretching from the brokers\u2019 offices to the business development managers, the report says. \u201cIt allows both major banks and smaller lenders to keep their hands clean of alleged fraud, while ensuring the blame falls on brokers,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe chain\u2019s complexity suggests it is purposefully designed to hide the banks\u2019 alleged fraud, providing a legal liability escape clause through plausible deniability. Under normal circumstances, banks would simply advertise sub-prime mortgages directly and hire more loan officers to meet demand. \u201cNo bank manager with a sound understanding of business principles would seek to establish and deal with a complicated brokerage chain and pay fees and commissions, especially since services can be provided directly to the public at a lower expense ratio and with less bureaucracy to increase profits.\u201d Despite Australian law requiring that a mortgage must be approved on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to finance the principal and interest payments out of income, this has not prevented lenders from approving mortgages based on the equity in the owner-occupied home. The report includes loan application forms from banks, including from Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, which suggest control fraud has been committed\u2013 crimes by the controlling agents of firms, including executives and managers. The report suggests credit assessors and bank officers have illegally altered borrower details by falsely inflating the value of assets and incomes to \u201cjustify\u201d issuing much larger mortgages than would otherwise be the case. \u201cBrokers are unwittingly engaged in control fraud as lenders coerce them into using the \u2018serviceability\u2019 or \u2018amortisation\u2019 calculators as covered above,\u201d the report says. \u201cBrailey has many emails leaked from the broker chain demonstrating lenders will not do business with brokers unless this calculator is used to fudge the borrowers\u2019 details.\u201d A response to the report by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank strongly refutes the allegation that borrower details were illegally altered. There were numerous controls in place to verify the information submitted in loan applications, the bank said. \u201cFurther, the bank maintains a \u2018hindsight\u2019 review process to review the credit quality of a random sample of loan approvals by credit assessors or officers,\u201d the bank said. \u201cThe bank is satisfied that these controls would detect systemic actions by its credit assessors or officers of the type alleged in the submission.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In February, Malcolm Turnbull suggested the budget would \u201cfor all practical purposes\u201d be the government tax white paper. In the end it was nothing of the sort. The major initiative of cutting company tax was a decision that handed out joy to the government\u2019s core constituency, but serves only to exacerbate some of the issues with Australia\u2019s tax mix. Cutting the company tax rate to 25% has been a pretty long-held staple of tax policy. The Henry Tax Review \u2013 now going on six years old \u2013 recommended such a cut. It has also been one of the common recommendations from the OECD. For example in its Going for Growth report issued in February this year, the OECD called for Australia to improve \u201cthe efficiency of the tax system by reducing the corporate tax rate.\u201d But as with all such economic recommendations there is a bit more to it than that. For example, yes the Henry Tax Review recommended cutting the company tax rate to 25%, it did so while arguing that \u201ccompany income tax also acts as a tax on profits derived from Australia\u2019s non-renewable resources\u201d. Thus it argued \u201cat the same time\u201d the government should introduce a \u201cbroad-based resource rent tax.\u201d Don\u2019t expect to find that anywhere in Scott Morrison\u2019s budget speech. Similarly, while the OECD did call for a cut to the company tax rate it recommended this be done \u201cas part of a wider reform that would also consider raising the currently low rate of goods and services tax (GST) and/or widening the base\u201d. So it\u2019s never about just cutting the company tax rate and pulling up stumps and slapping each other on the back, saying job well done. The main reason for recommending a cut to the company tax rate \u2013 indeed the one given by Morrison on Tuesday \u2013 is that our current rate is very high among the OECD. What is more is that in the past decade most other nations have cut their rates: Thus cutting the tax rate will make us more competitive with the rest of the world. The Treasury modelling done on a company tax cut in 2012 suggested the biggest reason for any resultant increase in GDP would be from \u201cgreater foreign investment flows into Australia to fund additional projects that are made viable by the reduction in the tax rate.\u201d But how big an impact would the company tax rate be? Well the Treasury modelling suggested a 1 percentage point cut in the company tax rate would lead to a 0.1% increase in GDP. This is pretty consistent with the modelling released after the budget, suggesting lowering the company tax rate to 25% would lead \u201cto a long-term percentage change\u201d in GDP of 1.1%. But given the cut in the company tax rate is scheduled to occur only by 2026-27, and the reduction of only 5 percentage points, to get to a 1.1 percentage point improvement we\u2019re probably talking a time frame where \u201clong-run\u201d means closer to 20 years away rather than 10. Clearly any long-term \u2013 or even for the matter annual \u2013 economic projections require assumptions that can go astray. And it is doubtful come 2026 or later that there\u2019ll be anything in the way of proof that our economy is 1.1% larger than it otherwise would have been \u2013 especially when we\u2019re talking of things that are the order of 0.1% in a year \u2013 essentially a rounding error in terms of GDP growth. The main benefit the Treasury sees of the cut in the company tax rate is to businesses themselves through greater investment, but most of the flow throughs to workers come via secondary effects. The Treasury, for example, projects employment in the long-run to be only 0.1% better \u2013 essentially nothing. But it does project that real wages would be 1.1% better in the long-run \u2013 this comes mostly from hoped-for productivity improvements that are the result of the increased investment. But hoping for wage increases from a company tax cut are more in the \u201coh if we close our eyes and wish really hard, they may come true\u201d basket, than anything you might call a rock solid certainty. Improved productivity is tough enough to accomplish, but greater investment doesn\u2019t always mean greater productivity. Certainly the boom in mining investment actually led to a decline in productivity in that sector. And that increased investment from a company tax cut is itself no sure thing. A 2012 Canadian study found that successive cuts in the Canadian company tax rate did little to spur foreign investment, and served mostly to improve the cash-flow of local businesses \u2013 but that increase did not lead to improved investment. The other argument for a company cut comes from a budgetary point of view. The general view is that company and income taxes are more prone to the swings and roundabouts of the economy, whereas sales taxes like the GST are more stable \u2013 which is certainly borne out by the budget papers: Australia is also more reliant upon company taxes than most nations; and equally less reliant upon GST-style taxes: Now that may not be any great concern but the budget papers also show that we are becoming more reliant upon both individual income and company taxes: Ten years ago at the heights of the mining boom, total income taxes accounted for 67% of tax revenue; by 2019-20 they are projected to account for 70.6%. That\u2019s not great if we hit any recession-like conditions \u2013 revenue will again go through the floor with any strong rise in unemployment. It also means the government really needs wages growth to meet its expectations. The budget predicted wage growth will return to 3.5% by 2019-20 \u2013 well up on the current rate of 2.2%: And as this week\u2019s income tax cuts demonstrate, being dependent upon a progressive income tax regime doesn\u2019t necessarily mean changes will always benefit the poor over the wealthy. The company tax cuts planned in the budget are to a large extent off in the never-never; should the LNP win the election they can certainly legislate the changes out over 10 years, but that gives plenty of time for a government strapped for revenue to decide to pause the cuts. It also is plenty of time for the benefits to be washed away. But it remains part of a broader discussion on the tax and transfer system. The changes in the budget actually narrow the tax base, but changes to taxes like the GST \u2013 because of their regressive nature \u2013 would necessitate increased government spending, in effect shifting our economy to more of a European-style one where tax revenue and government expenditure overall is much higher. By just looking at cutting the company tax rate the government is pretty much creating problems for itself later down the track \u2013 especially should the hoped for growth projections not pan out. Malcolm Turnbull once said the budget would be the government\u2019s tax white paper. If so, the government flubbed it, and it ensured tax policy and concerns about funding expenditure over the \u201clong-term\u201d won\u2019t go away.",

A <a href=\"https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/having-their-cake-and-eating-it-too\">2012 Canadian study</a> found that successive cuts in the Canadian company tax rate did little to spur foreign investment, and served mostly to improve the cash-flow of local businesses \u2013 but that increase did not lead to improved investment. </p> <p>The other argument for a company cut comes from a budgetary point of view. </p> <p>The general view is that company and income taxes are more prone to the swings and roundabouts of the economy, whereas sales taxes like the GST are more stable \u2013 which is certainly borne out by the budget papers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of tax revenue.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PdZy5/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Australia is also more reliant upon company taxes than most nations; and equally less reliant upon GST-style taxes:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Share of tax revenue - OECD.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OQWfE/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now that may not be any great concern but the budget papers also show that we are becoming more reliant upon both individual income and company taxes:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Size of taxes as a percentage of the economy\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QG3Io/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Ten years ago at the heights of the mining boom, total income taxes accounted for 67% of tax revenue; by 2019-20 they are projected to account for 70.6%.</p> <p>That\u2019s not great if we hit any recession-like conditions \u2013 revenue will again go through the floor with any strong rise in unemployment. It also means the government really needs wages growth to meet its expectations. </p> <p>The budget predicted wage growth will return to 3.5% by 2019-20 \u2013 well up on the current rate of 2.2%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual wage growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vLxii/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And as this week\u2019s income tax cuts demonstrate, being dependent upon a progressive income tax regime doesn\u2019t necessarily mean changes will always benefit the poor over the wealthy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2016/may/03/if-this-budget-was-a-tomato-in-a-shop-you-would-leave-it-there-it-is-a-bad-tomato\">If this budget was a tomato in a shop you would leave it there, it is a bad tomato | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company tax cuts planned in the budget are to a large extent off in the never-never; should the LNP win the election they can certainly legislate the changes out over 10 years, but that gives plenty of time for a government strapped for revenue to decide to pause the cuts. </p> <p>It also is plenty of time for the benefits to be washed away. But it remains part of a broader discussion on the tax and transfer system.</p> <p>The changes in the budget actually narrow the tax base, but changes to taxes like the GST \u2013 because of their regressive nature \u2013 would necessitate increased government spending, in effect shifting our economy to more of a European-style one where tax revenue and government expenditure overall is much higher. </p> <p>By just looking at cutting the company tax rate the government is pretty much creating problems for itself later down the track \u2013 especially should the hoped for growth projections not pan out. </p> <p>Malcolm Turnbull once said the budget would be the government\u2019s tax white paper. If so, the government flubbed it, and it ensured tax policy and concerns about funding expenditure over the \u201clong-term\u201d won\u2019t go away. </p>",
