      "bodyText": "Who needs Mark Carney and his forward guidance? That was the message from Britain's property market on Thursday as it emerged that buy-to-let mortgages were at their highest in more than four years, the prices of top properties in central London were up \u00a3500K in a year, and house-builder Bellway was seeing a sharp increase in reservations from those taking advantage of the government's Help to Buy scheme. No question: the UK housing market is emerging rapidly from its long hibernation. For the past half decade, the demand for homes has been weak and the economy has languished. Now it is a rejuvenated real estate sector that is driving the economy. For the time being, fears of a new housing bubble are overdone. The level of housing transactions, even after the recent pick-up is around half that at the peak of the pre-crash boom. Prices, according to the Halifax and the Nationwide are rising, but at less than 5% a year. Even so, the warning signs are there. Lenders are asking for smaller deposits from first time buyers and in some cases scrapping minimum income requirements. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says the market is starting to firm across the country and not just in London. Britain has had three serious housing market boom-busts in the past 40 years: in the early 1970s, the late 1980s and the mid 2000s. Unless policy makers are careful, this could be the start of the fourth. There are umpteen reasons for the surge in activity and the increase in prices. For a start, the housing market is hard wired to overheat. The UK is a small island with tight planning laws, a population in excess of 60m and a tax system that encourages owner-occupiers as there is no capital gains tax on a primary residence. Secondly, the shake-out during the crisis and its aftermath was less painful than that of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Fewer people lost their jobs and lenders adopted a benign approach \u2013 called forebearance \u2013 to lenders having trouble paying their mortgages. This was extend and pretend: extend the length of the mortgage term and pretend that borrowers were not really facing financial difficulties. Thirdly, official interest rates have been at 0.5% for more than four years and the Bank of England has created \u00a3375bn of new electronic money through its quantitative easing programme. It has taken time but the effects of a prolonged period of cheap money are now being felt. Fourthly, potential buyers know that there is no immediate risk of the Bank of England adopting a tougher approach. That was implicit even before this week's pledge not to push up the cost of borrowing until unemployment drops to 7%: that commitment has now been made explicit. Fifthly, the Treasury is now subsidising mortgages through Help to Buy. In its initial phase, the home loan guarantees apply only to newly-built homes: from next year any property up to a value of \u00a3600,000 will be covered. Finally, a low interest-rate environment has meant a shortage of alternative investments. The lack of affordable housing means that rental yields on the average property are above 6% \u2013 and that has proved attractive to buy-to-let landlords when saving rates are so low. David Whittaker, managing director of Mortgages for Business, said: \"To take advantage of high demand and high yields, landlords are refinancing in their droves to try to raise enough capital to make further additions to their portfolios.\" What does all this add up to? In the short term, it will give the recovery legs. The UK moved sideways after the economy bottomed out in 2009: the return of animal spirits to the housing market will give it some oomph. Even though prices are rising faster than wages, putting a squeeze on real incomes, extra borrowing will help top up consumer spending. Expansion of 3% next year looks entirely plausible. Initially, the job of keeping the housing market in check will fall to the Bank's new Financial Policy Committee. It is charged with preventing a re-run of the speculative frenzy that de-stabilised Britain in the mid-2000s and it has powers to make lending more expensive for banks and building societies. But economic output is still more than 3% lower than it was before the recession began in 2008 and the Bank is in no hurry to call an end to a party that has only just begun. The risk, as ever, is that remedial action \u2013 when it comes \u2013 is too little too late.",

      "bodyText": "JP Morgan has disclosed it faces criminal and civil investigations into the sale of mortgage-backed securities ahead of the financial crisis. The bank faces parallel investigations by the civil and criminal divisions of the US attorney's office for the eastern district of California, according to a regulatory filing made late Wednesday. The attorney's civil division has already \"preliminarily concluded\" that the bank broke civil securities laws in selling the securities between 2005 to 2007, according to the filing. JP Morgan also disclosed that it has received requests concerning mortgage securities from the US attorney for Connecticut, the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) enforcement division and the inspector general for the government's bank bailout programme relating to \"among other matters, communications with counterparties in connection with certain mortgage-backed securities transactions.\" The investigations come amid a battery of other probes into the banking giant's business from federal and state regulators. The bank also faces class action lawsuits over its $6bn losses related to the so-called \"London whale\" trader. JP Morgan is not alone in facing ongoing investigations into the sale of mortgage securities. The bank's disclosure comes in the same week that the justice department and the SEC filed separate suits charging Bank of America of understating the risks associated with the sale of $850m of mortgage-backed securities in 2008.

This expectation continues to be based on an unchanged overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the economy and subdued monetary dynamics.</p> <p>With regard to the economic analysis, following a six-quarter economic contraction in the euro area, recent confidence indicators based on survey data have shown some further improvement from low levels and tentatively confirm the expectation of a stabilisation in economic activity at low levels. At the same time, labour market conditions remain weak. Overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover at a slow pace. </p> <p>The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside.

Currently it's at 7.8%, and Bank forecasts suggest it is not likely to fall below 7% until at least 2016.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Sentance</strong>, a former member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, says it is a risky promise which might be broken. Writing in this morning's <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/article/mark-carney-s-promise-prolonged-low-interest-rates-risks-being-broken\">City A.M.</a> he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are two main risks attached to this approach of committing to keep interest rates low for a prolonged period. First, it could turn out to be a false promise. While the Bank\u2019s forecasts currently suggest that unemployment and inflation will not trigger a reassessment of the low interest rate policy, these projections have not been very accurate in the past.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the more firmly that individuals and businesses believe the promise of low interest rates, the more likely it is that they will increase their borrowing and spending, pushing up economic growth and inflation, and pushing down unemployment. So the more effective the policy is in influencing economic behaviour, the more likely it is to come to a premature end.</p> <p>Second, if the MPC keeps the official interest rate at the exceptionally low level of 0.5 per cent until 2016, this would represent a seven-year long period of very low interest rates. The risk attached to this strategy is that official rates could need to rise quite rapidly after this \u2013 delivering a big shock to consumers and firms that had based their decisions on a prolonged period of very low rates. The policy of keeping rates on hold for a extended period close to the zero lower bound would then result in the sort of interest rate shock which the MPC is currently trying to avoid.</p> <p>By committing to keep rates low, subject to a number of economic conditions, the MPC has delayed consideration of its exit strategy for now. The worry is that there could be a more painful shock to the economy when the time eventually does come to raise interest rates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-08T08:00:54.695Z\">at 9.00am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5203493ce4b0c55edad46ed2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-08T07:31:08.830Z\">8.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mark Carney on Radio 4's Today programme</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We'll have more on that meeting between Obama and Samaras later.</p> <p>Back in the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme following his revelation yesterday that interest rates will be tied to the unemployment rate. </p> <p>You can just about make him out in the studio here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MishalHusainBBC/statuses/365369110340698112\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Mark Carney is in the Today studio and ready to go live with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvanHD\">@EvanHD</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23r4today&amp;src=hash\">#r4today</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/cDQdTQNf0x\">pic.twitter.com/cDQdTQNf0x</a></p>&mdash; Mishal Husain (@MishalHusainBBC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MishalHusainBBC/statuses/365369110340698112\">August 8, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Carney gives a nod to his predecessor Sir Mervyn King but says there is further work to be done to change the culture within Britain's banks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Governor King and his colleagues made tremendous progress on improving the balance sheets of the banks.

      "bodyText": "One person who is apparently unimpressed by Mark Carney's forward guidance on interest rates is Charles Goodhart, another former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. He has dismissed it as cheap talk and so flexible that it allows the MPC to do whatever it wants, according to Bloomberg. Goodhart said the Bank would probably have to raise rates before late 2016, which is the timescale currently implied by its forecasts: I don\u2019t think forward guidance is ever very effective - it\u2019s cheap talk. I think, when it comes to the crunch, that the committee will always do what it thinks best on the day. I think there are so many conditions that are sufficiently flexible that the MPC can almost do what it wants whenever it wants to. The strength of the upwards pressure on the British economy could well cause people to begin to be concerned whether reverting to normality a bit quicker might not be desirable. US markets have opened higher following three days of falls. Dow Jones: +0.3% S&amp;P 500: +0.3% And European markets are still up: FTSE 100: +0.5% CAC 40: +0.7% DAX 30: +0.9% IBEX: 1.1% The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose by 5,000 last week to 333,000 according to the US Labor Department. Economists were expecting a bigger rise to 336,000. The four-week average, which gives a clearer underlying picture, fell to 335,500 - its lowest since November 2007, before the worst of the financial crisis took hold. Looking ahead to the meeting between President Obama and Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, which takes place at the White House tonight (UK time), the focus will likely be on Greece's attempts to drag itself out of financial disaster. According to the official White House schedule: The visit will highlight the strength of the US-Greek relationship today \u2013 bound together through enduring ties of kinship, common interests, and the NATO Alliance \u2013 and underscore the United States\u2019 ongoing support for Greece\u2019s efforts to reform its economy and promote a return to prosperity. The President also looks forward to discussing with the Prime Minister a broad array of mutual interests and challenges, including US-Greek defense cooperation, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, regional cooperation, mutual counterterrorism efforts, prospects for a settlement in Cyprus, developments in North Africa, and Syria. The OECD has published its latest set of monthly Composite Leading Indicators, designed to spot shifts in economic cycles. The Paris-based organisation noted \"moderate improvements\" in most major countries, with \"growth firming\" in the UK, US and Japan and \"gaining momentum\" in the eurozone. It was less upbeat about large emerging economies, and said growth was losing momentum in Brazil, China, and Russia. Read the full story here. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the indicators were the latest evidence that the economy got off to a good start in the third quarter: A current plethora of decent data and surveys across a wide range of sectors indicate that the UK economy has started off the third quarter very well after GDP growth doubled to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first. We now expect GDP growth to improve to 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, and it could very well come in higher still. Significantly, this would mark the first time since that the economy has achieved two successive quarters of GDP growth of at least 0.5% quarter-on-quarter since the first two quarters of 2010 and only the second time since 2007. As a result, in our final August forecast we have further upgraded our UK GDP growth projections to 1.3% (from 1.1%) in 2013 and to 2.0% (from 1.8%) in 2014. This is the third successive month that we have raised our GDP growth forecast, which is in marked contrast to the steady downgrades of recent past years. The economy has not been able to grow by at least 2.0% since 2007. Mark Carney: banks need to reconnect with society. Read our full story here. In other news on jobs, the Office for National Statistics has published a paper highlighting the impact of some of London's recent developments on employment. For example, the number of people employed in the area which includes the Westfield shopping centre at White City, rose from 8,000 in 2008 (when it opened) to 15,100 in 2012 - almost entirely due to increases in jobs in the retail, accommodation and food sectors. The centre provided a boost for employment in small- and medium-sized enterprises (with the number of employees rising by 110% between 2008 and 2012) as well as for large enterprises (up 86% between 2008 and 2012). In case you missed it this morning and want to listen, Mark Carney's interview by BBC Radio 4's Today programme is here. The Greek jobless rate rose to 27.6% in May from 27% in April as austerity and recession continued to weigh on prospects. It was the highest since the country's statistics agency started publishing the data in 2006, and more than twice the 12.1% eurozone average in June. The number of unemployed people in the country is now 1.38m, an increase of 30,558 compared with April. A breakdown of age groups shows unemployment among 15-24 year olds hit 64.9% in May: 15-24 - 64.9% 25-34 - 37.7% 35-44 - 24.7% 45-54 - 20.9% 55-64 - 16.2% 65-74 - 9.6% The ECB has also released its latest Survey of Professional Forecasters. The economists, academics and other professionals cut inflation forecasts for this year and next, predicting annual inflation of 1.5% in 2013 and 2014. Previously they were forecasting 1.7% and 1.6% respectively. The central bank targets inflation of close to, but below 2%. The same professionals are forecasting the eurozone economy will shrink 0.6% this year, before returning to growth of 0.9% next year. The European Central Bank has published its latest monthly bulletin after leaving policy on hold last week. It says \"the monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary\". It adds: The Governing Council confirms that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation continues to be based on an unchanged overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. With regard to the economic analysis, following a six-quarter economic contraction in the euro area, recent confidence indicators based on survey data have shown some further improvement from low levels and tentatively confirm the expectation of a stabilisation in economic activity at low levels. At the same time, labour market conditions remain weak. Overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover at a slow pace. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Recent developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include the possibility of weaker than expected domestic and global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. As regards fiscal policies, in order to bring debt ratios back on a downward path, euro area countries should not unravel their efforts to reduce government budget deficits. The emphasis should be on growth-friendly fiscal strategies which have a medium-term perspective and combine improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. The pound is up at near one and half month highs against the dollar. It rose 0.2% to $1.5515 earlier following a wave of upbeat data on the UK economy. The data raise expectations that unemployment will fall faster than currently expected, which could in turn lead to an earlier hike in interest rates and is supportive of a stronger pound. European markets are still up modestly: FTSE 100: +0.2% DAX 30: 0.07% IBEX: 0.5% The French CAC 40 is down slightly by 0.05%. A reminder that all is not rosy in the global economy came from Nestle this morning. The world's biggest food group and KitKat maker missed its first-half sales forecasts and lowered its full-year targets after cutting prices in Europe to encourage cash-strapped shoppers. Nestle said consumers in the region \"are extremely sensitive to price and we have been responsive\". This from Reuters: Nestle, the Switzerland-based maker of KitKat bars and Maggi soups, said underlying sales rose 4.1% in the first half, lagging a forecast for 4.6% in a Reuters poll, and implying a further deterioration from 4.3% in the first quarter, mainly due to weakness in Europe. It lowered its full-year target to around 5% sales growth, from 5-6% previously. Nestle said sales growth in Europe slowed to 0.6%, from 1% in the first quarter, hit by lower pricing. Germany and Britain saw healthy growth, but other markets, including eastern Europe, were hit by lower consumer spending. Meanwhile more reaction this morning to the Bank of England's guidance on interest rates yesterday. To recap, Carney announced that rates will be left on hold at the all-time low of 0.5% until the jobless rates falls below 7%. Currently it's at 7.8%, and Bank forecasts suggest it is not likely to fall below 7% until at least 2016. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, says it is a risky promise which might be broken. Writing in this morning's City A.M. he says: There are two main risks attached to this approach of committing to keep interest rates low for a prolonged period. First, it could turn out to be a false promise. While the Bank\u2019s forecasts currently suggest that unemployment and inflation will not trigger a reassessment of the low interest rate policy, these projections have not been very accurate in the past. Paradoxically, the more firmly that individuals and businesses believe the promise of low interest rates, the more likely it is that they will increase their borrowing and spending, pushing up economic growth and inflation, and pushing down unemployment. So the more effective the policy is in influencing economic behaviour, the more likely it is to come to a premature end. Second, if the MPC keeps the official interest rate at the exceptionally low level of 0.5 per cent until 2016, this would represent a seven-year long period of very low interest rates. The risk attached to this strategy is that official rates could need to rise quite rapidly after this \u2013 delivering a big shock to consumers and firms that had based their decisions on a prolonged period of very low rates. The policy of keeping rates on hold for a extended period close to the zero lower bound would then result in the sort of interest rate shock which the MPC is currently trying to avoid. By committing to keep rates low, subject to a number of economic conditions, the MPC has delayed consideration of its exit strategy for now. The worry is that there could be a more painful shock to the economy when the time eventually does come to raise interest rates. We'll have more on that meeting between Obama and Samaras later. Back in the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme following his revelation yesterday that interest rates will be tied to the unemployment rate. You can just about make him out in the studio here: Carney gives a nod to his predecessor Sir Mervyn King but says there is further work to be done to change the culture within Britain's banks: Governor King and his colleagues made tremendous progress on improving the balance sheets of the banks. We need to finish the job. The cultural issue is fundamentally important. There has to be a change in the culture of these institutions. Speaking ahead of a meeting between President Obama and the Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras in Washington later today, US Vice President Joe Biden had some words of encouragement for Greece: The President and I are acutely aware that the Greek people are living through an incredibly difficult period as they cope with the economic crisis that has lasted four years and has required enormous sacrifice.

European investors are feeling gently optimistic this morning, with all major indices up: FTSE 100: +0.3% CAC 40: +0.2% DAX: +0.1% IBEX: +0.2% There were mixed messages from Europe's largest economy this morning. Trade data showed German exports rose in June, by 0.6% compared with May, but imports fell 0.8% raising doubts about the strength of domestic demand. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. In China a stronger than expected set of trade data trade has eased fears over a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Chinese exports rose more sharply than forecast, by 5.1% in July compared with a year earlier, while imports surged 10.9%. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged and said the economy was starting to recover. Both developments are likely to translate into a positive open for European markets this morning according to Michael Hewson of CMC Markets.",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned Britain's high street banks that they risk becoming socially useless unless they focus on the real economy and help businesses invest and create jobs. Carney, a former Goldman Sachs financier, said the banking industry needs to be aligned with the business community and not \"disconnected from society\". Speaking a day after he announced plans to keep interest rates at 0.5% for the next three years, he also stressed that mis-selling products to customers to turn a profit undermines the effectiveness of banks. Carney, who was boss of Canada's central bank before joing the BoE last month, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The cultural issue is fundamentally important. There has to be a change in the culture of these institutions. \"I think finance can absolutely play a socially useful and an economically useful function but what it needs in order to do so, the focus has to be, of the financier, the people working in the banking system, has to be on the real economy, what it does for businesses making investment, what ultimately it means for jobs in the economy. \"And it's the loss of that focus, it's finance that becomes disconnected from the economy, from society, finance that only talks to itself and deals with each other, that becomes socially useless. As governor, Carney chairs the monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, and acts as chief watchdog over the banking system in his role as chair of the financial policy committee (FPC). When he was headhunted by George Osborne last year Carney had risen to international prominence as a member of the Financial Stability Board, an offshoot of the G20 given the task of setting international standards for banks most likely to cause a repeat of the 2008 financial crash. Asked whether people working for banks should sell a product to a customer to make a profit, even if they know the product was bad for the customer, Carney said: \"Absolutely you shouldn't sell it. \"Let me be absolutely clear as well, the type of behaviour you're talking about is conduct behaviour. But let me say as governor of the Bank of England, and this is something that is shared by my colleagues, it's that attitude which indicates even if we're not directly responsible for that behaviour, it's that attitude in institutions that undercuts their effectiveness, is bad for the system, and to the extent that with our powers we can use them, we work to snuff them out.\" Carney said he wanted to promote more women into prominent positions at the bank after being struck by their absence when he arrived. \"It is an astounding situation,\" he said. \"We need to grow women into roles as top economists here and get them in a position where they can apply to be the next governor.\" The betting firm Paddy Power said Sheila Dow, emeritus professor at the University of Stirling, was the frontrunner at 3/1 to succeed Carney should an all women shortlist be drawn up, followed by HSBC's European economist Janet Henry at 4/1 and Morgan Stanley's UK economist Melanie Baker at 5/1. Former Whitehall economist Vicky Pryce, who was jailed earlier this year for perjury, was ranked a 66/1 outsider. The governor also said he had \"tremendous sympathy\" for savers hit by the BoE's announcement that interest rates will not rise from their record low until more than 750,000 new jobs have been created. Households and businesses have been told not to expect interest rate rises until 2016 after the MPC said rates will remain at 0.5% until the unemployment rate drops to 7%, depending on stable inflation. In a direct rebuff to critics of the BoE's low interest rate policy, he said reducing the stimulus to the economy risked choking off the economic recovery and repeating Japan's lost decades, where interest rates have remained at rock-bottom levels for almost 25 years. Carney said the best way to get back to normal interest rates is to have a strong economy. He told the programme: \"I first lived in this country in the 1980s. After that I lived in Japan and it was the start of life after the financial crisis and in Japan they made two mistakes. \"The first was they didn't fix the banks quickly enough \u2013 in the UK we are fixing the banks. Secondly, as their recoveries began, they pulled back on stimulus too early and those recoveries didn't gather life and as a consequence, almost a quarter-century later, interest rates are still at rock-bottom levels in Japan. \"We don't want to make those mistakes here in the UK. This is about ensuring that in the reasonable future, and I recognise that it's difficult for savers, but in the reasonable future we're delivering that strong economy that will deliver higher interest rates and jobs.\" The prime minister, David Cameron, insisted he was \"confident\" the economy would create jobs, and hailed Carney's forward guidance on interest rates as a vote of confidence in government policy.",

Net profit rose 3.7% to 5.1bn Swiss francs (\u00a33.6bn) in the first half, in line with estimates.",
