      "bodyText": "The potential impact of the oil price slump on Scotland was underlined as a leading energy expert warned on Wednesday that North Sea oilfields could be shut down if the oil price fell by just a few more dollars. The rising sense of crisis about the plummeting price \u2013 which has fallen 60% in the last six months \u2013 prompted the Scottish government to promise an emergency taskforce to try to preserve jobs in the offshore energy sector. Meanwhile, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England warned that the Scottish economy was heading for a \u201cnegative shock\u201d. The oil industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie said that at the current price for Brent blend, of $46 a barrel, some UK production was already failing to break even, and further falls could endanger output. Robert Plummer, a research analyst with the firm, said that at $50 a barrel oil production was costing more than its value in 17 countries, including the US and UK. Plummer told Scottish Energy News: \u201cOnce the oil price reaches these levels producers have a sometimes complex decision to continue producing, losing money on every barrel produced, or to halt production, which will reduce supply.\u201d Concern about cutbacks was heightened Wednesday when Shell announced it was scrapping a $6.4bn (\u00a34.2bn) energy project in the Middle East because it was no longer commercial, with oil prices falling to six-year lows. Plummer said that if oil prices fell to $40, a small but significant part of global supply would become \u201ccash negative\u201d, although some operators would choose to keep producing oil at a loss rather than stop production. Large companies such as Shell, BP and Chevron, have already spoken of hundreds of job cuts in Aberdeen amid expectations that overall spending across the industry will be slashed by anywhere up to 30% for the coming year. Carney told MPs on the Treasury select committee that falling oil prices would deal a blow to the Scottish economy but that the decline would be offset by the boost to the wider British economy due to the falling petrol prices. \u201cIt is net positive for the UK economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a negative shock to the Scottish economy, which is substantially mitigated \u2026 by the nature of the economic union that exists.\u201d He was asked about an estimate suggesting the price slide could wipe \u00a36bn off Scottish GDP, but he said the bank had not calculated the hit to Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, outlined plans to set up a new energy jobs taskforce with the aim of maintaining jobs and mitigating the impact of losses.

It is now vital, in order to prolong the life of the industry beyond 2050 and maximise economic benefits, that the UK government maintains the momentum for fiscal and regulatory change in the oil and gas sector.\u201d The SNP has faced criticism in recent weeks for its failure to respond to the growing crisis in Scotland\u2019s North Sea oil and gas business. Labour accused SNP ministers of \u201csitting on their hands\u201d and failing to tackle the impact of plummeting oil prices, which fell to $115 before the summer. Scottish Labour\u2019s finance spokeswoman, Jackie Baillie, said: \u201cThe falling oil price is the biggest threat to jobs in Scotland since [the close of the steel plant at] Ravenscraig, and the Scottish government has been silent on the issue.\u201d The chancellor, George Osborne, used the autumn statement last month to cut taxes but the industry has said his initiatives did not go far enough.

A recent report for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills had warned that 35,000 jobs would be at risk over the next five years \u2013 and that was largely concluded before the latest oil price slump. Drilling levels had collapsed in the North Sea even when prices exceeded $100, partly because of rising costs and a hike in taxes by the government three years ago. With production falling fast over the last 10 years the government requested an industry review by the oil industry figure Sir Ian Wood; it called for a huge shake-up of regulation in the sector. Shell, in a joint statement with its partner, Qatar Petroleum, about the Ras Laffan petrochemical scheme, said: \u201cThe decision came after a careful and thorough evaluation of commercial quotations from EPC [engineering, procurement and construction] bidders, which showed high capital costs rendering it commercially unfeasible, particularly in the current economic climate prevailing in the energy industry.\u201d The cutbacks in the oil and gas industry are global.

China\u2019s <a href=\"http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-01-13/news/58024491_1_copper-china-international-futures-top-consumer-china\">imports of copper hit an all-time high</a> in December. <br></p> <p>But China is slowing. Just Tuesday, the World Bank suggested that a \u201cdisorderly slowdown\u201d in China would force it to reduce its forecast for global growth outside the US. It said the slowdown in Chinese property and land sales will prevent the national and local governments from boosting growth by investing in infrastructure. The World Bank said the world economy would grow by only 3% for 2015, down from an earlier estimate of 3.4%.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m getting worried that this [drop in copper prices] is telling us not all is right with the global economy and that it is slowing faster than anticipated,\u201d said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale. <br></p> <p>\u201cIf you asked me three to six months ago, I would have been less worried; I would have said it\u2019s oversupply of oil, iron ore, coal.

Because it\u2019s used in all sorts of building materials and historically its price movements were tracked for insights into the robustness of industrial activity. \u201cCopper is a good barometer of economic health and always has been,\u201d Bhar said.</p> <p>While there are concerns about the slowing global economy and whether the strength of the US economy can withstand sluggishness elsewhere, Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy, rates and foreign exchange research at TD Securities, said the copper market itself has had its own problems for a while now.</p> <p>Chiefly, its problem is overproduction. Copper mining supplies are growing at a faster pace than demand, and have been since 2013, Melek said.</p> <p>Melek said copper demand from China, the world\u2019s No 1 user of the red-colored metal, is still expected to grow by 4% to 4.5%, but the issue is that previous expectations were for greater growth.</p> <p>\u201cI think there is certainly concern on the part of Chinese traders,\u201d he said, noting most of Wednesday\u2019s price break occurred during Asian trading hours. During the US trading day, prices started to rise off those lows. </p> <p>Bhar said what may have triggered Wednesday\u2019s plunge is that in the past few days there were fewer purchases by metal buyers, sending signals that perhaps copper users wouldn\u2019t need as much supply as originally thought. <br></p> <p>Combine that with the weakness in oil, a trend of weakening copper prices anyway (prices fell for much of 2014) and general malaise about the global economy and there were reasons to sell, he said.</p> <p>And of course, trimming copper production in the face of lower values isn\u2019t as easy as pressing the \u201coff\u201d button for miners. It takes a long time to stop and restart production. </p> <p>Finally, Melek said, a lot of investors who buy commodities do so via indexes which hold baskets of several commodities. Many of these indexes are dominated by energy, and their big losses from 2014 have persisted into 2015. <br></p> <p>Investors could be shedding these holdings, leading to losses across commodities, including copper.</p> <p>\u201cWith oil acting in a bad, bad way, investors who own these indexes are dumping everything. They\u2019re throwing copper away with their broad commodity [investments],\u201d he said.</p>",

The World Bank said the world economy would grow by only 3% for 2015, down from an earlier estimate of 3.4%. \u201cI\u2019m getting worried that this [drop in copper prices] is telling us not all is right with the global economy and that it is slowing faster than anticipated,\u201d said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale. \u201cIf you asked me three to six months ago, I would have been less worried; I would have said it\u2019s oversupply of oil, iron ore, coal. But the combination of greater supply with weaker demand is suggesting it\u2019s indicative that the global slowdown is taking place.\u201d Why does copper matter? Because it\u2019s used in all sorts of building materials and historically its price movements were tracked for insights into the robustness of industrial activity. \u201cCopper is a good barometer of economic health and always has been,\u201d Bhar said. While there are concerns about the slowing global economy and whether the strength of the US economy can withstand sluggishness elsewhere, Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy, rates and foreign exchange research at TD Securities, said the copper market itself has had its own problems for a while now. Chiefly, its problem is overproduction. Copper mining supplies are growing at a faster pace than demand, and have been since 2013, Melek said. Melek said copper demand from China, the world\u2019s No 1 user of the red-colored metal, is still expected to grow by 4% to 4.5%, but the issue is that previous expectations were for greater growth. \u201cI think there is certainly concern on the part of Chinese traders,\u201d he said, noting most of Wednesday\u2019s price break occurred during Asian trading hours. During the US trading day, prices started to rise off those lows. Bhar said what may have triggered Wednesday\u2019s plunge is that in the past few days there were fewer purchases by metal buyers, sending signals that perhaps copper users wouldn\u2019t need as much supply as originally thought. Combine that with the weakness in oil, a trend of weakening copper prices anyway (prices fell for much of 2014) and general malaise about the global economy and there were reasons to sell, he said. And of course, trimming copper production in the face of lower values isn\u2019t as easy as pressing the \u201coff\u201d button for miners. It takes a long time to stop and restart production. Finally, Melek said, a lot of investors who buy commodities do so via indexes which hold baskets of several commodities. Many of these indexes are dominated by energy, and their big losses from 2014 have persisted into 2015. Investors could be shedding these holdings, leading to losses across commodities, including copper. \u201cWith oil acting in a bad, bad way, investors who own these indexes are dumping everything. They\u2019re throwing copper away with their broad commodity [investments],\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "MPs have urged Britain\u2019s retailers to boycott Black Friday, attacking the demand on police resources caused by the US-inspired sales bonanza that saw officers called to stores across the country as sales events descended into chaos. Greg Mulholland, the Lib Dem MP for Leeds North West, criticised major chains for adopting the discount day and sympathised with police officers who said they had \u201cenough to do already\u201d. Incidents included people fighting over televisions at Asda in Wembley and officers intervening after 200 people refused to leave a Tesco Extra store in the Manchester area despite being told it was sold out. The promotional day did not boost the total amount of sales, profits or number of parcels delivered over Christmas above the level already expected, according to research by online retailers assocation IMRG. It squeezed huge numbers of orders into a few days, putting unprecedented pressure on delivery systems. \u00a3810m was spent online on Black Friday last year, the biggest ever day for UK online sales. \u201cIt was a tsunami situation, sales slid back before it hit and subsided afterwards,\u201d said Andrew Starkey, head of e-logistics for IMRG. Nearly a fifth of all online sales rung up in the eight weeks to 27 December occurred in the week of Black Friday, a total of \u00a33.7bn, with the volume of items ordered on the late November weekend at least 30% ahead of expectations, according to analysis with advisory firm Capgemini. \u201cIt caught the public\u2019s imagination and retailers\u2019 imagination and suddenly everyone was on the case,\u201d said Starkey. The researchers forecast shoppers would spend 12% more online, taking sales to \u00a3116bn through the year. Starkey warned that retailers would have to come up with tactics, such as spreading deliveries over a longer period or making click &amp; collect services more appealing, in order to cope with a similar spike in demand this year. \u201cThere\u2019s no economic way retailers can reserve capacity all year for just that weekend. That\u2019s the challenge for the industry,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, Andy Street, the boss of John Lewis, called on fellow retailers to rein in Black Friday promotions this year and ensure the day was focused on electrical goods rather than becoming a widespread discounting event affecting fashion, homeware and other categories. Conservative former minister Sir Peter Bottomley backed Mulholland in urging UK retailers to boycott the event from now on. But Craig Wheeler, a director of beauty products website Feelunique.com, said he was planning for sales to be twice as big. Alex Baldock, group chief executive of Shop Direct, the owner of the Littlewoods and Very brands, said the company had already begun talks with suppliers about this year\u2019s event as he expected another step up in Black Friday fever. \u201cWe think it\u2019s certainly here to stay and we will make a lot of it in 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is perfectly possible to prosper on Black Friday if you are a good trader, can negotiate good deals and are well prepared months in advance,\u201d he said. Shop Direct enjoyed its busiest trading day ever last year with orders at its Very.co.uk brand up 134% compared to a year before. Baldock said the event helped Shop Direct take market share and enjoy a 4% rise in total sales for the seven weeks to 26 December despite an 11% fall in sales at its traditional catalogue brands Littlewoods and K&amp;Co.",

The hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman said that he considered investing in Tesco, but decided against it saying that he had some trouble with retail and the structural changes in the industry. This could be significant. If large investors aren\u2019t willing to take a risk on Tesco then the stock price could struggle to gain traction until larger investors are happy that the industry has turned a corner. Still with retail, SuperGroup surged 84.5p to 896p after a positive update, but Game Digital dropped 106p to 242p after Tuesday\u2019s late profit warning. Cineworld dipped 0.2p to 405.3p, despite the company issuing an upbeat trading statement for the year, with total revenues up 1.7%, and saying that full year profits would be at the top end of market expectations. Its UK and Ireland business outperformed the market, with box office revenues up 0.1%, reflecting a 3.7% fall in admissions offset by a rise of 4% in average ticket prices. The company, which opened two new cinemas in the UK during the year, said there was a strong film release programme for 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Star Wars: Episode VII, Jurassic World and the final Hunger Games title. N+1 Singer said: In a year of relatively few blockbusters and the World Cup drag, to deliver an anticipated earnings per share growth of around 11% is highly creditable. Oriel analyst Jeffrey Harwood said: The shares have staged a strong rally in recent months, but this is a positive update today. With a strong cash flow and the encouraging outlook for 2015 we remain keen on the shares. Finally Spire Healthcare closed 13.6p lower at 339.8p. After the market closed private equity group Cinven announced it planned to sell part of its stake, amounting to 10% of the business and worth around \u00a3140m. Cinven would be left with 48.3% if all the shares are placed with institutional investors as planned.",

      "bodyText": "Brand Beckham has sold underpants, razors, fish fingers, designer fashion and the game of football around the world, and now it has also come to the aid of Burberry\u2019s \u00a31,500-a-go trenchcoats. The venerable British fashion label has credited a Christmas advertising campaign fronted by Romeo Beckham, the 12-year-old son of Victoria and David, with boosting sales in the US, Europe and the Middle East \u2013 and helping to make up for falling sales in Hong Kong in the wake of the pro-democracy demonstrations. Sales of Burberry coats, bags and fashion climbed 14% to just over \u00a3600m in the three months to the end of December. That was better than City retail analysts had expected and Burberry bosses said the adverts featuring Beckham junior had been a big success. The four minute film featured Romeo and 50 dancers \u2013 all decked out in the label\u2019s trademark trenchcoats \u2013 spinning umbrellas on a London-themed set at Elstree studios. It racked up 9m views on Youtube and trended on Twitter all day following the campaign\u2019s launch. A 10% increase in sales of trenchcoats followed, with demand particularly strong in the US. That offset a fall in sales in Hong Kong, which usually accounts for 10% of Burberry\u2019s global sales, as civil rights protestors camped out in the streets. The big increase in sales of the company\u2019s trenchcoats means it is now taking on new staff at the factory where they are made in Castleford, Yorkshire. It currently employs 750 people, a quarter more than two years ago. The success of the campaign was good news for Burberry but also marks the expansion of the Beckham brand into the next generation. Romeo, described as \u201cthe fashion one\u201d of the Beckham children by his former footballer father, made his modelling debut for Burberry in 2013. His mother Victoria is a friend of Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s designer and chief executive. Bailey has previously said that they discussed using Romeo to front the brand for more than a year before the youngster stepped into the studio. Victoria has also championed the brand. She was recently pictured in one of Burberry\u2019s top-selling ponchos and joining Romeo and husband David at the London launch of the Christmas campaign. Bailey said Romeo was an \u201cutter joy\u201d to work with. The designer told Youtube channel On Demand Entertainment after the first campaign: \u201cHe\u2019s the sweetest, loveliest little chap. He loves clothes and fashion, he has an aesthetic point of view. He knows what he likes and he had a lot of fun.\u201d Simon Fuller, the former Spice Girls manager, reportedly negotiated a \u00a345,000 fee for Romeo\u2019s one day of work on the ad, which was shot by fashion photographer Mario Testino and directed by Bailey in the style of an old-school musical. It was Burberry\u2019s first-ever Christmas ad to appear on TV and was also shown in cinemas and across social media around the world. Images from the advert were then used in a billboard campaign. The tie-up with the Beckhams is a typically smart move for Bailey. He has transformed the image of Burberry from a fusty, aging brand worn by middle-aged golfers or ripped off for the football terraces into a modern global empire. Harnessing the power of social media and digital technology, Bailey has linked Burberry to new trends, including British indie bands, personalised clothing and young British fashion faces such as Cara Delevigne. David Alexander, a consultant at retail advisory firm Conlumino, said: \u201cOn the marketing front, Burberry remains one of the most innovative brands in retail.\u201d Burberry would not comment on whether Romeo will appear in any future campaigns, but the brand has a history of long-term relations with the stars of its ads, such as Kate Moss and Emma Watson, and Beckham the younger is widely expected to be back in a trenchcoat in future.",

The price of copper, seen as a barometer of global economic demand, fell as much as 8% to a low not seen for more than five years after the World Bank said the world economy was too reliant on the US. The bank blamed reduced prospects for growth in the eurozone, the state of finances in Japan and some big emerging economies for its decision to cut its 2015 global growth forecast to 3% from 3.4%.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The owners of the 222-metre (734ft) \u201cCheesegrater\u201d building, the second tallest building in the City of London, are to replace dozens of long bolts on its structure after it was revealed that another one had fractured. The bolts, among 3,000 on the building\u2019s 15,000-tonne frame, are each just under a metre long. Two snapped in November, with some debris falling to the ground from the fifth floor. Nobody was hurt, but an area below the tower is still cordoned off. The third broken bolt was captured by tethering put in place last year. Tests conducted by the contractor Laing O\u2019Rourke and the structural engineers Arup concluded the bolts fractured due to a process called hydrogen embrittlement, which leads to cracks. The Cheesegrater, officially titled the Leadenhall building, is not the first landmark building to suffer from technical problems. The nearby \u201cWalkie Talkie\u201d skyscraper was found to be reflecting light from its south-facing concave facade, melting parts of a car in the street below and scorching carpets and cracking tiles in nearby shops. That problem has been fixed (by covering the glass wall with a non-reflective film), but now locals complain of a wind tunnel effect in the streets below. This is also true of other tall buildings, such as the \u201cGherkin\u201d. In another mishap, a window fell 28 storeys from the Gherkin in 2005. The Millennium Bridge in London was quickly renamed the wobbly bridge when it began swaying and people complained of feeling sick, and closed just three days after opening while crossing it. It was temporarily closed while engineers installed 91 dampers, similar to car shock absorbers. And the 43-storey Strata tower in south London, the holder of the 2010 Carbuncle Cup, has three wind turbines fitted to its roof which are rarely turning \u2013 despite the developers\u2019 claims that they would generate 8% of the tower\u2019s electricity. The developer behind the building, British Land, said the Cheesegrater\u2019s structural integrity had not been affected by the problems with the bolts. The business information group Dun &amp; Bradstreet became the first company to move in last month. The building\u2019s architects, Lord Rogers\u2019 practice, is moving to the 14th floor, leaving their current home at Thames Wharf Studios in Hammersmith. This means about 70% of the total office space is now let or under offer. Other tenants include global insurance broker Aon, insurance firms Amlin and Rothesay Life and Australian serviced office provider Servcorp. The Cheesegrater set a new record for office rents in the City in October when the US-based insurance company FM Global took the 41st floor at \u00a385 per sq ft. Rogers also designed the Lloyds of London building across the road, which opened in 1986. The radical, award-winning Grade I listed building is known for its pipes and lifts on the exterior. However, two years ago the then-Lloyd\u2019s chief executive Michael Ward criticised the high maintenance cost of the \u201cinside out\u201d building. He said you\u2019d be lucky to make it down to the ground floor, as the lifts \u201cbreak down with some frequency\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the fundamental problem with this building. Everything is exposed to the elements and that makes it very costly.\u201d The lifts are now being refurbished.",

      "body": "<p>The owners of the 222-metre (734ft) \u201cCheesegrater\u201d building, the second tallest building in the City of London, are to replace dozens of long bolts on its structure after it was revealed that another one had fractured.</p> <p>The bolts, among 3,000 on the building\u2019s 15,000-tonne frame, are each just under a metre long. Two snapped in November, with some debris falling to the ground from the fifth floor. Nobody was hurt, but an area below the tower is still cordoned off.</p> <p>The third broken bolt was captured by tethering put in place last year. Tests conducted by the contractor Laing O\u2019Rourke and the structural engineers Arup concluded the bolts fractured due to a process called hydrogen embrittlement, which leads to cracks.</p> <p>The Cheesegrater, officially titled the Leadenhall building, is not the first landmark building to suffer from technical problems. The nearby \u201cWalkie Talkie\u201d skyscraper was found to be reflecting light from its south-facing concave facade, melting parts of a car in the street below and scorching carpets and cracking tiles in nearby shops. </p> <p>That problem has been fixed (by covering the glass wall with a non-reflective film), but now locals complain of a wind tunnel effect in the streets below. This is also true of other tall buildings, such as the \u201cGherkin\u201d. In another mishap, a window fell 28 storeys from the Gherkin in 2005. </p> <p>The Millennium Bridge in London was quickly renamed the wobbly bridge when it began swaying and people complained of feeling sick, and closed just three days after opening while crossing it. It was temporarily closed while engineers installed 91 dampers, similar to car shock absorbers. And the 43-storey Strata tower in south London, the holder of the 2010 Carbuncle Cup, has three wind turbines fitted to its roof which are rarely turning \u2013 despite the developers\u2019 claims that they would generate 8% of the tower\u2019s electricity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"14a4ae12483cb5eefc3e10a317a1995b5ebbc051\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421236862904/67232352-ba5d-4c7c-8274-4d40065bce81-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The Leadenhall building, aka the Cheesegrater.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Leadenhall building, aka the Cheesegrater.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The developer behind the building, British Land, said the Cheesegrater\u2019s structural integrity had not been affected by the problems with the bolts. The business information group Dun &amp; Bradstreet became the first company to move in last month. </p> <p>The building\u2019s architects, Lord Rogers\u2019 practice, is moving to the 14th floor, leaving their current home at Thames Wharf Studios in Hammersmith. This means about 70% of the total office space is now let or under offer. Other tenants include global insurance broker Aon, insurance firms Amlin and Rothesay Life and Australian serviced office provider Servcorp. The Cheesegrater set a new record for office rents in the City in October when the US-based insurance company FM Global took the 41st floor at \u00a385 per sq ft.</p> <p>Rogers also designed the Lloyds of London building across the road, which opened in 1986. The radical, award-winning Grade I listed building is known for its pipes and lifts on the exterior. </p> <p>However, two years ago the then-Lloyd\u2019s chief executive Michael Ward criticised the high maintenance cost of the \u201cinside out\u201d building. He said you\u2019d be lucky to make it down to the ground floor, as the lifts \u201cbreak down with some frequency\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the fundamental problem with this building. Everything is exposed to the elements and that makes it very costly.\u201d The lifts are now being refurbished.</p>",

The company, the best performing main market flotation last year, saw its shares slump 56% to below its 200p IPO price before recovering some ground.</p> <p>It is now down 36% or 128p at 220p, after it warned full year profits would be flat at around \u00a351m, compared with expectations of a figure above \u00a360m. It was hit by heavy competition leading to price cutting and bundling of games with consoles, which reduced margins.</p> <p>Retail analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Christmas trading update from high-flying Game Digital wasn\u2019t due until January 15, but yesterday was a good day to bury bad news...and, to our astonishment, a profit warning from Game Digital hit the screen at 5.09pm yesterday evening.</p> <p>The timing may have been prompted by the update about to come out from its US peer GameStop (although that looks to have pleased Wall Street), but the nub of the problem is that Christmas was very competitive. Total sales fell by 6.7% over the last 11 weeks and due to the lower than expected gross margin rates being achieved on hardware.</p> </blockquote> <p>Analysts at Liberum moved from hold from buy, as did Canaccord Genuity. Canaccord cut its price target to 300p from 393p, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The video games market remains buoyant, with sales of PS4/XboxOne units running materially ahead of the previous generation (PS3/Xbox 360). However, unprecedented sales activity over the Black Friday/Cyber Monday period (Game sold 16% of total first half console units over the four days) drove more aggressive bundling activity across UK/Spain retail, reducing revenues, but also materially impacting gross margins.</p> <p>Revenues were always likely to be soft in the second quarter, given particularly tough comparables from the November 2013 launch of both PS4 and Xbox One. Game has held its market share (and significantly increased its share of the digital console games market). However, increased promotional activity means that gross margins fell by 0.4% in the first half.</p> <p>On our revised forecasts, the shares are on a prospective calendarised 2014 PE of 17.8x, enterprise value/Ebitda of 9.7x and yield 4.3%. Moreover, management has reiterated its intention \u201cto return excess cash to shareholders\u201d: we estimate that management could return at least \u00a320m, without reducing supplier credit, and while retaining material balance sheet flexibility. </p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has fallen 102.19 points to 6440.01, with mining shares bearing the brunt of the selling. With the World Bank cutting its growth forecasts and reinforcing views of a slowdown in the global economy, metal prices are falling, in particular copper. Overnight falls on Wall Street after a positive start, and in Asia, set the trend for European markets.</p> <p>A ruling from the European Court of Justice seemed to suggest there was no reason why the European Central Bank should not unveil a stimulus programme at its meeting next week. David Papier, market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unease over the global economy engulfed commodities and dented Asian equities on Wednesday, while the euro loitered near nine-year lows as investors bet the European Central Bank was just a week away from launching a new stimulus campaign. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Antofagasta</strong>, the Chilean copper miner, is the biggest faller in the leading index, down 67.5p at 641.5p while <strong>Glencore</strong> is down 23.2p at 245.75p and <strong>Anglo American</strong> has lost 92.5p to \u00a310.53.</p> <p>In all, seven of the ten biggest fallers are mining shares.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Tesco</strong> has added 5.5p to 217.5p as Exane BNP Paribas moved from neutral to outperform and raised its target price from 180p to 250p.</p> <p>Positive updates helped <strong>SuperGroup</strong>, up 67.5p to 879p, and <strong>Just Eat</strong>, 12.5p better at 342p.</p> <p>But online grocer<strong> Ocado</strong> is down 6.5p at 403.4p despite reporting December sales up 14.8%, and Clive Black at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ocado\u2019s gross retail sales increased by 14.8% in the first month of its new financial year (Shore Capital\u2019s estimate was 16.5%); there was no new information on average basket size, which has been easing off in recent times. Total revenues, including the contribution from servicing Morrison\u2019s, are not provided albeit management does state that in the seven days to Christmas its customer fulfilment centres (CFCs) at Dordon and Hatfield processed 40% more items year-on-year under its own steam and for Morrison\u2019s; the latter of which stated that Morrison.com sales contributed 1.0% to like-for-like sales. </p> <p> We continue to have a low opinion of the Ocado business model. Having had to be financially rescued following its less than glorious flotation, the group continues to struggle to generate strong EBITDA, industry leading margins (as originally promised), meaningfully positive earnings or any sign of a dividend stream. </p> <p>Quite simply, Ocado has never come to terms with how to reward its shareholders through a satisfactory return on capital or earnings per shaer \u200ewithin a time span that human beings recognise.</p> <p>The basic fact remains that the company has an inability to cost effectively distribute multi-temperature food products from centralised facilities to fragmented customers. More to the point, the domestic store based competition is making strong strides forward in store picking, dark store fulfilment and click &amp; collect, where Asda is delivering particularly noticeable advances; Ocado is structurally disadvantaged in respect of Click &amp; Collect with no store base to collect from.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "As markets plunged on falling commodity prices, it was not a day to be a Christmas loser. And Game Digital\u2019s after hours profit warning on Tuesday has had a predictable effect. The company, the best performing main market flotation last year, saw its shares slump 56% to below its 200p IPO price before recovering some ground. It is now down 36% or 128p at 220p, after it warned full year profits would be flat at around \u00a351m, compared with expectations of a figure above \u00a360m. It was hit by heavy competition leading to price cutting and bundling of games with consoles, which reduced margins. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: The Christmas trading update from high-flying Game Digital wasn\u2019t due until January 15, but yesterday was a good day to bury bad news...and, to our astonishment, a profit warning from Game Digital hit the screen at 5.09pm yesterday evening. The timing may have been prompted by the update about to come out from its US peer GameStop (although that looks to have pleased Wall Street), but the nub of the problem is that Christmas was very competitive. Total sales fell by 6.7% over the last 11 weeks and due to the lower than expected gross margin rates being achieved on hardware. Analysts at Liberum moved from hold from buy, as did Canaccord Genuity. Canaccord cut its price target to 300p from 393p, saying: The video games market remains buoyant, with sales of PS4/XboxOne units running materially ahead of the previous generation (PS3/Xbox 360). However, unprecedented sales activity over the Black Friday/Cyber Monday period (Game sold 16% of total first half console units over the four days) drove more aggressive bundling activity across UK/Spain retail, reducing revenues, but also materially impacting gross margins. Revenues were always likely to be soft in the second quarter, given particularly tough comparables from the November 2013 launch of both PS4 and Xbox One. Game has held its market share (and significantly increased its share of the digital console games market). However, increased promotional activity means that gross margins fell by 0.4% in the first half. On our revised forecasts, the shares are on a prospective calendarised 2014 PE of 17.8x, enterprise value/Ebitda of 9.7x and yield 4.3%. Moreover, management has reiterated its intention \u201cto return excess cash to shareholders\u201d: we estimate that management could return at least \u00a320m, without reducing supplier credit, and while retaining material balance sheet flexibility. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 102.19 points to 6440.01, with mining shares bearing the brunt of the selling. With the World Bank cutting its growth forecasts and reinforcing views of a slowdown in the global economy, metal prices are falling, in particular copper. Overnight falls on Wall Street after a positive start, and in Asia, set the trend for European markets. A ruling from the European Court of Justice seemed to suggest there was no reason why the European Central Bank should not unveil a stimulus programme at its meeting next week. David Papier, market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Unease over the global economy engulfed commodities and dented Asian equities on Wednesday, while the euro loitered near nine-year lows as investors bet the European Central Bank was just a week away from launching a new stimulus campaign. Antofagasta, the Chilean copper miner, is the biggest faller in the leading index, down 67.5p at 641.5p while Glencore is down 23.2p at 245.75p and Anglo American has lost 92.5p to \u00a310.53. In all, seven of the ten biggest fallers are mining shares. Elsewhere Tesco has added 5.5p to 217.5p as Exane BNP Paribas moved from neutral to outperform and raised its target price from 180p to 250p. Positive updates helped SuperGroup, up 67.5p to 879p, and Just Eat, 12.5p better at 342p. But online grocer Ocado is down 6.5p at 403.4p despite reporting December sales up 14.8%, and Clive Black at Shore Capital said: Ocado\u2019s gross retail sales increased by 14.8% in the first month of its new financial year (Shore Capital\u2019s estimate was 16.5%); there was no new information on average basket size, which has been easing off in recent times. Total revenues, including the contribution from servicing Morrison\u2019s, are not provided albeit management does state that in the seven days to Christmas its customer fulfilment centres (CFCs) at Dordon and Hatfield processed 40% more items year-on-year under its own steam and for Morrison\u2019s; the latter of which stated that Morrison.com sales contributed 1.0% to like-for-like sales. We continue to have a low opinion of the Ocado business model. Having had to be financially rescued following its less than glorious flotation, the group continues to struggle to generate strong EBITDA, industry leading margins (as originally promised), meaningfully positive earnings or any sign of a dividend stream. Quite simply, Ocado has never come to terms with how to reward its shareholders through a satisfactory return on capital or earnings per shaer \u200ewithin a time span that human beings recognise. The basic fact remains that the company has an inability to cost effectively distribute multi-temperature food products from centralised facilities to fragmented customers. More to the point, the domestic store based competition is making strong strides forward in store picking, dark store fulfilment and click &amp; collect, where Asda is delivering particularly noticeable advances; Ocado is structurally disadvantaged in respect of Click &amp; Collect with no store base to collect from.",
