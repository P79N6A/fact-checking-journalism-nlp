      "bodyText": "Millions of Britons have enjoyed a last hurrah in the Boxing Day sales with determined shoppers camping out in the early hours to secure the best bargains although crowds were smaller than in previous years. Shoppers started queuing outside branches of high street chain Next at 12.30am while on Oxford Street, in London a crowd started forming outside Selfridges at 2.30am. However, retail experts said that overall shopper numbers were significantly down on 2016. The power of the Boxing Day sales has been diminished in recent years due to a combination of internet discount extravaganzas such as November\u2019s Black Friday and the fact that major stores such as Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis start their sales online on Christmas Eve. But even if crowds were thinner, shopping centre owners reported brisk trade as those who did venture out spent more. \u201cPeople like to come sale shopping because it is the thrill of the kill,\u201d said Tom Nathan, general manager at Brent Cross, one of London\u2019s biggest shopping centres. \u201cSome chains have also held back putting discounted items online, which has forced people out from behind their computers.\u201d Nathan said there was was also an element of people trading up to branded products: \u201cPopular items are full-length boots, cashmere coats and knitwear. People have waited for expensive items that are heavily discounted. People are also buying more cleverly. In perfumery Boots and Fenwicks have gift items that are 30% off and people are stocking up for later in the year.\u201d In London, one Selfridges shopper, Matthew O\u2019Clery, a 19-year-old student from Perth, Australia, who braved the crowds in London\u2019s West End described the store as \u201can absolute zoo\u201d as sharp-elbowed shoppers hunted down discounted Alexander McQueen handbags and half-price Stella McCartney dresses. Selfridges\u2019 tills banked \u00a34m in the first three hours of its sale with the retailer reporting that Boxing Day would be its biggest trading day of the year after 120,000 shoppers trekked to the London store. Leaving Brent Cross, Arnold Ilunga, 26, a lorry driver from Stanmore, north-west London, said he had not meant to buy anything on the shopping trip but by lunchtime was holding more than 10 Zara bags, containing two coats and shirts and jumpers for his three children. \u201cMy wife dragged me out,\u201d said Ilunga. \u201cI ended up getting more than I imagined. Even with the long wait I prefer going to shops rather than buying online because if the item doesn\u2019t fit it\u2019s a pain to return online stuff.\u201d In the run-up to Christmas fewer people visited the shops to buy their gifts and that trend continued on Boxing Day. Near closing time total shopper numbers were 4.5% down on last year, according to research group Springboard which tracks visits to shopping centres and high streets. \u201cWhat we have seen in the last couple of years is a structural shift in the Christmas trading period,\u201d said Springboard analyst Diane Wehrle. She said the Black Friday sales had changed the way people shop because retailers started discounting in November. Unlike most high street rivals, Next does not cut its prices before Christmas and the 1,000-strong crowds outside its branches in Birmingham and Silverburn, Glasgow, indicated the enduring appeal of big discounts, even in an age of non-stop discounting. The same is true for stores such as Zara. Nathan said visitor numbers had held up at Brent Cross. \u201cIt looks as if we were ahead of last year [in terms of footfall] and we are very busy today with trading somewhere around last year\u2019s figure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just footfall but the level of spend. Retailers are seeing the average take per basket going up because people are busier and have reduced the number of shopping trips. So when they do come they spend more.\u201d Analysts are expecting consumers to cut back in the new year as inflation, linked to the weakness of sterling, erodes spending power and a wobbling housing market chips away at consumer confidence. Britons are also absorbing the impact of the first Bank of England base rate rise in over a decade on their finances. Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman, said consumer confidence was paper thin: \u201cThere\u2019s massive uncertainty. You\u2019ve got inflation coming through, you\u2019ve got earnings lagging to where they were years ago. This makes life difficult. Why would people be optimistic?\u201d But the upmarket stores in London\u2019s West End are insulated from the country\u2019s wider economic woes as high-spending tourists flocked to Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street. The New West End Company predicted that more than \u00a350m would be spent there on Boxing Day alone, up 4% on 2016. \u201cThe Boxing Day sales have become a tradition for domestic customers but we also predict a high number of international visitors will take advantage of currency fluctuations and low-cost flights to come to the West End,\u201d said Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of New West End Company, who predicted West End stores would rake in \u00a3190m over the Boxing Day week. In Selfridges, Yang Cui is admiring an expensive haul that includes makeup, a suit, handkerchiefs and a scarf. \u201cI am from China and there is high taxes there on goods, that\u2019s why people buy clothes and handbags here,\u201dhe said. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest retailer, has apologised after being hit with a series of complaints about the condition of its Christmas turkeys. The supermarket group has pledged to investigate after customers claimed on social media that they had bought \u201crancid, rotten\u201d turkeys and had had to order takeaways after discovering that the meat had gone off. People complained on Facebook and Twitter on Christmas Day about the poultry, which costs up to \u00a359 in the store\u2019s Finest range. Carl Barber, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, wrote: \u201cThis was bought only a few days ago and it\u2019s out of date. 23 quid wasted now have no Xmas turkey for Xmas day. Any customer services available today??\u201d Alison Kendall, also from Essex, said her Christmas dinner had been ruined. She wrote: \u201cThank you Tesco for the Finest Turkey Crown with a sell-by date of 26/12 that had gone off by the 25th \u2026 ruining our Christmas Dinner. \u201cImagine my sheer panic at 6am on Xmas Day, opening the turkey wrap to be hit by that \u2018gone off\u2019 smell with 10 people coming to Xmas Dinner.\u201d Kirsten Shore, from Stafford, Staffordshire, wrote: \u201cSnap! We had the same problem! \u201cOur first time hosting and a rotten turkey from @Tesco ruined our day!

Thanks Tesco!\u201d Tesco apologised on social media to people affected and offered them a refund. A spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019ve sold hundreds of thousands of great-quality British turkeys this Christmas. \u201cWe have exceptionally high standards so we will look to address the small number of complaints in recent days. \u201cWe will get in touch with each customer so we can investigate how these instances may have happened.\u201d Last week, the retailer pledged that it would become the first to no longer waste food fit for human consumption. The company\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, urged other supermarket chains to follow suit and adopt the changes, which it will implement by March. Along with all the other big UK supermarkets, Tesco has signed the Courtauld Commitment 2025, a voluntary agreement to cut food waste by 20% within a decade.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "1. Interest rates will stay low Another 0.25% hike is expected in late spring, taking the Bank of England base rate to 0.75%. That will add \u00a322 to the typical \u00a3175,000 tracker mortgage, but with more than half of all borrowers on fixed rates, it will probably go unnoticed by most homeowners. With the economy weak, the market does not expect any further hikes across the year. Mortgages will remain cheap although, with inflation outpacing wage rises, will still very much feel like a burden. 2. Housebuilding will rise New home building has picked up with 217,000 homes coming on to the market in 2016-17, up 20% on the year before. But that only brings the total back to levels seen before the financial crash, and a long way short of the 300,000 target set by the government. If \u201cBrexodus\u201d migration numbers continue to fall and construction activity picks up further, the supply side of the housing equation will be less pressing than in previous years. 3. Landlords will lose out to first-time buyers First-time buyers should be in the ascendant in 2018, with lending for buy-to-let in retreat. As recently as 2015 landlords snapped up 120,000 houses using buy-to-let finance, but the Council of Mortgage Lenders expects this to fall below 80,000 in 2018. Rising taxes and tougher lending criteria are slowly tipping the balance in favour of homebuyers rather than property speculators. 4. Stamp duty cut and help to buy will continue propping up developers Philip Hammond abolished stamp duty for all properties up to \u00a3300,000 bought by first-time buyers with immediate effect in the budget. The move will save four out of five first-time buyers up to \u00a35,000. But the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts that it will raise prices by 0.3%, with the increase coming in 2018. Meanwhile, the help-to-buy scheme has been given another \u00a310bn boost, providing financing until 2021, although critics say it has been squandered in chasing up the price of new-builds. 5. Tenants may find some relief, at last After years of galloping rent increases, landlords are finding they can\u2019t squeeze tenants any further. Average UK rents rose by less than 1% in 2017, and fell in London. With salaries under pressure from inflation, few expect real rent increases in 2018. Tenants will applaud the new ban on letting agency fees \u2013 when it eventually arrives. There is still no date fixed for the ban to come in, but the government insists it will happen some time in 2018. 6. The rich will go higher and higher The 56 storeys of One Nine Elms will race up London\u2019s skyline during 2018, with the first buyers (prices started at \u00a3800,000 at launch) moving in in 2019. But its crown as the city\u2019s highest residential tower will be swiftly grabbed by the Spire in Docklands. It will have 67 storeys housing 861 suites (many at \u00a32m-plus) and will be completed in 2020. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "On occasion, chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royces, Bentleys and high-end Mercedes can be seen navigating the roundabouts of an east London industrial estate squeezed between Europe\u2019s largest sewage treatment plant and the remains of what were once the world\u2019s largest gasworks. While the fancy cars are an incongruous sight in this Beckton industrial estate, the drivers have not lost their way. They pull up outside a nondescript blue and grey warehouse opposite a FedEx parcel collection hangar. The warehouse looks like all others on the estate, but on closer inspection it bristles with CCTV cameras, and the doors are surrounded by 12ft metal security barriers capable of stopping a truck. The rich are driven here to inspect their gold. \u201cThey come in here, they inspect [their gold bars] and caress them,\u201d says Lorena Baird, executive director of Baird &amp; Co, the UK\u2019s only gold refinery, which has been operating quietly in east London for half a century. \u201cEach customer has an individual box and we bring it to them here so they can see and feel their gold.\u201d Baird, 50, says it is not just the super-rich who are turning to gold as a safe haven investment in this increasingly turbulent world. \u201cOur customers can be anyone from a grandmother to a billionaire,\u201d says Baird, who took the helm following the death of her husband, Tony Baird, who founded the company in 1967. \u201cWhatever happens in the world, there\u2019s one thing you can be certain about \u2013 people will still want to buy gold.\u201d Every time there\u2019s a major global event, the price of gold sparks and the phones in Baird\u2019s warehouse ring. The last time the price rose significantly was last month when the US president, Donald Trump, warned North Korea not to \u201ctry us\u201d. \u201cNorth Korea, Brexit, whenever something big happens, it is reflected in the [gold] price,\u201d Baird says. \u201cGold is a hedge against inflation; gold is the safe haven.\u201d There is gold everywhere in the Baird warehouse, where pawned jewellery is melted down and refined into fresh gold bars. As well as producing gold bars, the company also makes gold sovereigns, 50,000 rings a year and collectables on demand. In 2013, Cadbury commissioned Baird to make 18-carat gold replicas of its most popular chocolate bars, which were given away to customers \u00e0 la Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. As well as producing gold, platinum and rhodium (a silvery white metal in the platinum family which is rare and more expensive than gold), the company holds the nation\u2019s biggest private gold vault. Baird says she is unable to state how much gold is on the premises for security reasons, but it is hundreds of millions of pounds\u2019 worth. Most of the gold is formed into 1,000-gram bars stamped with Baird\u2019s seal and kept in the vault. A gold bar is much smaller than you might expect \u2013 thinner and shorter than an iPhone 6, but much, much heavier. A very satisfying weight. Baird\u2019s bars, she says, are actually slightly heavier than the 1,000-gram standard as the company prides itself on the quality of its bars and can\u2019t risk a customer bringing their own scales and catching the firm out. How much, heavier? Like a gram? Baird bursts out laughing. \u201cNo!\u201d Each gram of 24-carat gold is worth \u00a327.93 at the time of writing, and none of it is wasted. \u201cDon\u2019t sneeze,\u201d Baird warns at one point as she shows the Guardian the full process of how trays of broken, discarded pawnbroker jewellery of varying quality are transformed into a new bar of ultra-fine gold. It is impossible to achieve 100% purity and 99.99% is the closest refiners can get. The purity needed for 24-carat designation is 99.95%. The bucket of brown sand she is holding contains 6kg of gold (worth about \u00a3160,000). It is the product of Baird\u2019s \u201cWilly Wonka\u201d refining process, which converts jewellery that arrives with an average gold content of 37% to the 99.9% purity product. It\u2019s a multi-stage process involving heating the gold up to 1,200C or more and mixing it with a lot of acid. Parts of the process, carried out by Baird\u2019s 62 employees dressed in blue overalls, have changed little since the ancient Egyptians invented it. Despite the intense industrial processes, Baird says waste water leaving the factory is cleaner than the drinking water coming out of its taps. Any incoming gold that contains cadmium, mercury or other toxic metal is rejected. The firm employs a chemist to analyse the molecular makeup of all gold shipments coming in and all waste leaving. Under almost every machine is what looks like a cat litter tray. But there are no factory cats (the Guardian\u2019s photographer inquired just to make sure). The trays are there to absorb any waste water leaking out of the machine, because the water is likely to contain enough gold to be worth keeping. \u201cThere is gold everywhere. It is in the air,\u201d Baird says. To keep as much gold in the building as possible, workers are asked to take off their overalls at the in-house laundry before they go home. The laundry is equipped with regular looking washing machines, but the waste water is pumped through filters to capture any gold particles. There are also filters attached to all the ventilation shafts. \u201cAt the end of the year all of the filters are collected together and burned,\u201d Baird says. \u201cEverything is \u2018deep cleaned\u2019 and burned, all of the filters and all of the doormats both inside the refinery and throughout the office.\u201d Last year the company retrieved \u00a315,000 worth of gold from the deep clean. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
