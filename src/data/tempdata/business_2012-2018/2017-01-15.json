      "bodyText": "The ranks of the 40-plus energy companies jostling for householders\u2019 business will swell on Monday with the launch of a new supplier that delivers electricity from windfarms. Fischer Energy hopes to sign up 40,000 customers in the first year to its single variable tariff, with renewable power bought from Denmark\u2019s Dong Energy. The new entrant arrives less than two months after the collapse of another small supplier, GB Energy UK. Experts have raised concerns that the retail energy market is approaching saturation point and question the wisdom of consumers signing up for a variable tariff at a time of rising wholesale prices. Keith Bastian, Fischer\u2019s chief executive, said he had been motivated to start the company because of the inequality of multiple tariffs, and that offering a single tariff would reduce confusion. \u201cThat will in effect put the customer first,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can buy the energy knowing it\u2019ll be a fair price. It won\u2019t be the cheapest, we can\u2019t guarantee that, but it will be fair.\u201d The supplier, a family-owned business based in Leicester, would not risk GB Energy\u2019s fate by \u201cgoing down the road of a race to the bottom\u201d on price, Bastian said. He added that while the company would be on comparison sites, it would not pay commissions to them. The company, which has around 25 employees, is also going up against some long-standing green energy suppliers such as Good Energy and Ecotricity with its pledge to supply 100% renewable electricity. \u201cGreen energy is the only way forward. Burning carbon fuels is not the solution,\u201d Bastian said. It is not yet clear whether Fischer will stand out against the Big Six and a crowded landscape of smaller players. \u201cThey\u2019ve talked about it being a unique offering with one tariff that\u2019s fair for all. Well there are a number of suppliers doing that. You take Bulb, they have one tariff and renewable electricity,\u201d said Stephen Murray, an energy expert at Moneysupermarket. He said the comparison site had noticed that since GB Energy\u2019s demise, customers were erring towards more established players such as British Gas, EDF, npower, E.ON, ScottishPower and SSE. Ofgem says there are currently 44 active suppliers in the retail market. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting there [near saturation point]. If a supplier comes with a unique and innovative approach then great, but I\u2019m not sure what that approach is at the moment,\u201d Murray said. Joe Malinowski, the founder of The Energy Shop comparison site, said: \u201cI think the market is way over-saturated with new entrants. It doesn\u2019t need another one, and what they\u2019re doing is not unique.\u201d He also echoed Murray\u2019s concern about single variable tariff: \u201cThe problem with having a variable tariff in a volatile market is you have to keep raising the price.\u201d Fischer is due to publish details of its tariff on Monday, when an Edinburgh couple also launch a crowdfunding effort to raise \u00a3450,000 to set up a new energy supplier later this year that would offer greater transparency. David Pike and Karin Sode say Our Energy will share its salaries and accounts with customers.",

      "bodyText": "One of the most famous pieces of football commentary came at the end of a match in Oslo more than 35 years ago in which unfancied Norway beat England 2-1. Few fans could now name the Norwegian commentator, Bj\u00f8rge Lillelien, but plenty remember the rant and how it ended: \u201cMaggie Thatcher, can you hear me? Your boys took one hell of a beating.\u201d The humiliation for the boys with three lions on their shirts took place in 1981 during the early stages of a North Sea oil boom that benefited both Norway and Britain. Norway decided that it would set up a sovereign wealth fund \u2013 a piggy bank for the people \u2013 so future generations would reap the benefits of the unexpected bonanza. Britain did not. The result is that Norway has amassed $885bn (\u00a3727bn) \u2013 easily enough to cope with the cost of looking after a population of 5 million as it ages. In Britain, by contrast, the NHS is at breaking point, the social care system is struggling to cope and there is no pot of gold to pay for the healthcare and nursing fees of the baby boomer generation as it advances into old age. Norway is currently winning the sovereign wealth fund contest $885bn to nil. One hell of a beating indeed. The lack of a UK-wide fund speaks volumes. There is an ingrained culture of short-termism in which consumers spend more than they earn and governments can see no further than the next election. As the Wikipedia list of sovereign wealth funds shows, even the world\u2019s poorest countries have tried to put some of the proceeds from oil and gas extraction away for a rainy day. Ghana and Gabon, for example, both have such funds. One result of last year\u2019s EU referendum is that it has forced people to take a long, hard look at Britain\u2019s economic model and come up with possible remedies for its weaknesses. These have been perfectly encapsulated in the six months since the Brexit vote. The economy is growing at a fair old lick, but mainly because consumers are out on a debt-fuelled spending spree. Britain has the lowest investment rate in the G7, a frighteningly large balance of payments deficit, and \u2013 as any long-suffering commuter shivering on a station this winter will testify \u2013 public infrastructure that doesn\u2019t pass muster. The supply of new homes in parts of the country with strong local labour markets is insufficient to keep pace with demand. It is obvious that structural change is needed, but the question is how to bring it about. Here are a couple of ideas recently aired. Thomas Aubrey, who runs the Centre for Progressive Capitalism, says in a report that one problem limiting new house building is that the local infrastructure needed to support new developments is low. This is because it tends to be paid for out of general public expenditure and when it comes to a list of government priorities, a new road or bridge ranks lower than an NHS funding crisis. Internationally, this way of funding infrastructure is the exception rather than the rule. Across Europe and Asia, other countries use land value capture to fund projects. They acquire land for housing at existing \u2013 usually industrial or agricultural \u2013 use value. Re-designation for a new housing project increases the value of the land, which is the local authorities then capture, allowing them to fund new infrastructure investment. This is not the way it works in England and Wales. The 1961 Land Compensation Act means that landowners are guaranteed the uplift in land values if, say, an industrial site is designated for housing. \u201cThis means there is less financing around for large-scale infrastructure investment to open up new areas for housing,\u201d Aubrey says. The ability of a small number of landowners to generate windfall profits in this way undermines the legitimacy of the economic system he adds. The solution, he says, is to amend the 1961 act so that land designated in a strategic plan for transport or housing would not take account of any prospective planning permission when deciding on the level of compensation. The public rather than the landowners who reap the benefits, which Aubrey estimates would provide the wherewithal to spend an extra \u00a3172bn on infrastructure investment over the next 20 years. That would result in a lot more houses being built and, if the government is serious about making the economy work for everyone, such reform will feature in the forthcoming housing white paper. John Penrose, the Conservative MP for Weston-super-Mare, has a more radical suggestion \u2013 do what should have been done all those years ago and launch a sovereign wealth fund. This would not be easy. North Sea oil and gas production is well past its peak. The proceeds of the boom years have been spent and Britain is a net importer of energy again. Penrose says the way to finance a sovereign wealth fund is through a national debt charge. This would be carved out of income tax and pay for the interest on the national debt. The national debt charge would be set as a percentage of GDP, and as the economy grows any surplus would be used to pay off the national debt and build up a fund that would cover the liabilities in the pensions and benefits systems. This would need to be a very large fund, worth double the current size of the economy, and would clearly take a long time to build up. Penrose thinks it might take a century and has been trying to gauge the extent of all-party support for the idea. There are two parts of the plan that might appeal to opposition parties. The first is his suggestion the government should legislate a target for the percentage of GDP to be spent on long-term infrastructure investment similar to the 0.7% in place for overseas development and 2% for defence. The second is that there is justifiable concern that young people are being unfairly saddled with the costs of a pay-as-you-go system for pensions and welfare that are bound to rise over time. Inter-generational fairness is becoming an important political issue. Penrose argues that borrowing can only be justified for infrastructure spending, because investment in public works benefits future as well as the current generation. Labour agrees that borrowing should only be for investment, although it is likely that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will take some persuading to sign up to Penrose\u2019s plan to have a totally balanced budget across the business cycle. A bigger problem is that creating a sovereign wealth fund would involve deferred gratification, or having less today in exchange for more tomorrow. That\u2019s not how we do things in Britain.",

      "bodyText": "What should Theresa May, when she speaks on Tuesday about her plans for the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union \u2013 say about the City and financial services? As an opening pitch, she should take her cue from the governor of the Bank of England and remind the EU 27 that the UK \u2013 if only in this single commercial field \u2013 holds a strong negotiating hand. Mark Carney first made his point about the UK being \u201cthe investment banker for Europe\u201d in November and last week\u2019s reiteration put hard facts on the table for a second time: \u201cIf you rely on a jurisdiction [ie the UK] for three-quarters of your hedging activities, three-quarters of your foreign exchange activity, half your lending and half your securities transactions you should think very carefully about the transition from where you are today to where the new equilibrium will be.\u201d Quite. The dominance of the City of London within European financial services is enormous and, in one sense, unsurprising. In big wholesale financial markets, trading activity tends to concentrate in order to keep costs low. This liquidity effect reinforces regional leadership, especially in age of international trade. Some \u00a3440bn of contracts are cleared daily in the UK. If the other EU states, at the moment of Brexit, tried to grab too much of the business dominated by the City, chaos might follow. The cost of capital and the cost of trading could increase for many continental firms in the so-called \u201creal\u201d economy because the continental European banking system is simply not equipped to deal with a sudden transition. Frankfurt, as UK bankers have reminded us many times, is a city of only 700,000 people. Over the course of a couple of decades, it might be able to become the EU\u2019s financial hub, but the process couldn\u2019t happen overnight. Paris, being much larger, is a better medium-term prospect, but at the moment it isn\u2019t clear that the big French and German banks \u2013 as opposed to a few politicians in those countries \u2013 want to relocate anywhere. A bigger obstacle is regulatory. All that wholesale financial activity needs to be policed, and the bulk of the expertise is in London. It is also clear who stands behind the Bank of England, the UK\u2019s chief financial regulator \u2013 it is the UK government and, ultimately, UK taxpayers. Who stands behind the European Central Bank? A collection of 27 national governments and taxpayers, which leaves plenty of room for disagreement in the event of a crisis along 2008-09 lines. The practical difficulties in shifting Europe\u2019s financial centre explain why the Jenga analogy \u2013 used by HSBC chairman Douglas Flint and endorsed by Carney \u2013 is powerful. It is safe to remove a few wooden blocks \u2013 or areas of financial activity \u2013 from the tower, but you can never be sure at what point the whole construction will come crashing down. Brexit still posed risks to financial stability in the UK, Carney argued, but the threat to the EU 27 would be greater if London-based international banks could no longer gain easy access to European countries and corporations. Therein lies the case for a transitional deal, and also a permanent arrangement that suits both sides. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, is open to a \u201cspecial\u201d relationship with City post-Brexit, according to minutes of a meeting seen by the Guardian. There needs to be work \u201coutside of the negotiation box \u2026 in order to avoid financial instability,\u201d he is reported to have said. The prime minister should seize the opening. In most areas of trade, the Brexit negotiations will be hideously complicated, not least because the EU 27 cannot be seen to be too generous to the UK. But, in financial services, the EU 27 risk damaging their own competitiveness if they play rough with London. The path towards mutual self-interest ought to be obvious. The sooner the first steps are taken, the better. Inflation shock won\u2019t be much comfort to anyone It has been a miserable start to the year for economic forecasters. Lampooned in 2016 by Michael Gove and other Brexiters, they began 2017 with yet more criticism, for predicting the post-referendum slump that never was. Even the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said his profession was in crisis. This week could bring some solace to experts who insist the economic pain of the Leave vote has been delayed, not averted. A deluge of figures this week will shed light on pay, jobs, prices and our willingness to shop since the Brexit vote sent the pound tumbling. Inflation figures on Tuesday are key to gauging how much a surge in import costs is being passed on to consumers. We already know factories are paying much more for materials and energy thanks to a weaker pound and a higher oil price. The City view is that inflation will tick higher from November\u2019s two-year high of 1.2%. On Wednesday, labour market figures may provide clues as to how far pay growth can keep pace with these rising living costs. Wages are increasing in real terms for now, but few see this trend continuing to the end of the year as employers decide they cannot, or do not need to, award big pay rises. Unemployment is expected to stay low but economists will be watching for a further slowdown in the pace of hiring as nervous firms brace for Brexit talks. Finally, retail sales figures on Friday are expected to show that Britons kept on splashing out in December. Expect to hear the optimists say consumers are shrugging off Brexit. The pessimists will warn that December marked a debt-fuelled last gasp for the retail industry before a tough 2017. In short, the picture will remain murky, with something for everyone to pick from to suit their view. But the pound is still down 18% against the dollar. An inflation shock is coming, and living standards will suffer. There are only faint glimmers of this now, but by the time we see figures for January and February, the pressures of a Brexit-battered pound will be undeniable. Tidal power good for a government all at sea Former Tory minister Charles Hendry claimed last week that tidal lagoons would be cheaper than any other form of power across their 120-year lifetime. The reality is that wind and solar are both tried and tested and cheaper today, but for ideological reasons the government has effectively halted their expansion. With those two sidelined, the last eight coal power stations closing by 2025, new nuclear at least a decade away and ambitious carbon targets looming, it\u2019s hard to see what form of power generation fills the gap and ticks the boxes of security, affordability and decarbonisation. Offshore windfarms and biomass are unlikely to do it alone. In that context a \u00a31.3bn \u201cpathfinder\u201d lagoon at Swansea Bay, while pricey for what is a small power station, looks like a \u201cno regrets\u201d plan, as Hendry\u2019s tidal power review put it. Given how the government has boxed itself in, anything that can open up a new industry, cut emissions and be built in four years looks worth floating.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tim Martin, founder of the JD Wetherspoon pub chain, does not do Davos \u2013 which is neat. The annual boondoggle in the Swiss Alps, which convenes again this week, is unlikely to deprive him of many of his regulars. Still, while the pub landlord will be in the UK and concentrating on preparing for Wednesday, when the group will give its trading statement, it seems likely a similar topic might dominate both events. Martin was one of the highest-profile businesspeople calling time on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union, and used his 800-odd boozers and the chain\u2019s magazine to make his points. (\u201cAll the thousands of Davos men and women who have their jaws firmly clamped around the euro-teat,\u201d as he once put it). That made him even more unpopular with that particular set (they can occasionally be quite sniffy about his pubs) while his euro rivals rejoiced when the Brexit vote knocked the Wetherspoon shares. Still, might Martin be about to have the last laugh? There are challenges in the sector, but last week All Bar One owner Mitchells &amp; Butlers reported a \u201cparticularly strong\u201d Christmas trading period, seemingly providing another riposte to the doom and gloom predicted by many Remainers. If Wetherspoon\u2019s trading follows suit this week, expect some gloating. A merry little retail Christmas While the British drinker seems to be heroically buoying the pubs\u2019 figures, their counterparts sashaying along our high streets have been performing a similar service for our shops. Marks &amp; Spencer has reported its best Christmas in six years, Morrisons its best in seven and Majestic Wine its \u201cbiggest ever\u201d, while even dreary old Debenhams did better than expected. This week we get a host more retailers reporting results, including Greggs, Pets at Home, Halfords and N Brown. There\u2019ll also be data in the form of December\u2019s retail sales from the Office for National Statistics, which curiously might show a slight slip. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says the seasonally adjusted figures are expected to show that retail sales volumes dipped 0.4% month-on-month in December, although this would still see them up 6.6% year-on-year. Still, he cautions: \u201cThe serious concern for the economy \u2013 and retailers in particular \u2013 is that it looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will weaken markedly over the coming months, with purchasing power being increasingly squeezed and the labour market probably weakening.\u201d Developing. Is Royal Mail pension still first class? You might have missed last year\u2019s Pension Scheme of the Year Awards, so here\u2019s a recap: the Royal Mail scooped a hat-trick of gongs for: defined benefit scheme of the year (asset value of over \u00a32.5bn); defined benefit communications (private sector); and best administration. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not letting it go to our heads,\u201d the Royal Mail Pension Plan gushed at the time. \u201cWhile we\u2019re thrilled to win these awards, our focus remains on continuing to improve member outcomes through improving our performance.\u201d Royal Mail staff will no doubt be soothed by those words as they study the group\u2019s trading statement this week, which comes against the backdrop of a potential strike. The company has said it\u2019s considering shutting its final salary pension scheme as, despite a huge surplus, the fund is supposedly running out of cash. So while the trustees might be dedicated to enhancing \u201cmember outcomes\u201d, the firm is targeting the opposite. Or as Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary for postal at the CWU, puts it: \u201cSo we move from shadow boxing to the ring, and negotiations will now begin in earnest ... However, any attempt to introduce any unagreed change by the business would be met with an industrial action ballot.\u201d This article was amended on 15 January 2017 to remove a typo from the headline.",

      "body": "<p>Tim Martin, founder of the JD Wetherspoon pub chain, does not do Davos \u2013 which is neat. The annual boondoggle in the Swiss Alps, which convenes again this week, is unlikely to deprive him of many of his regulars.</p> <p>Still, while the pub landlord will be in the UK and concentrating on preparing for Wednesday, when the group will give its trading statement, it seems likely a similar topic might dominate both events.</p> <p>Martin was one of the highest-profile businesspeople calling time on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union, and used his 800-odd boozers and the chain\u2019s magazine to make his points. (\u201cAll the thousands of Davos men and women who have their jaws firmly clamped around the euro-teat,\u201d as he once put it).</p> <p>That made him even more unpopular with that particular set (they can occasionally be quite sniffy about his pubs) while his euro rivals rejoiced when the Brexit vote knocked the Wetherspoon shares.</p> <p>Still, might Martin be about to have the last laugh? There are challenges in the sector, but last week All Bar One owner Mitchells &amp; Butlers reported a \u201cparticularly strong\u201d Christmas trading period, seemingly providing another riposte to the doom and gloom predicted by many Remainers. If Wetherspoon\u2019s trading follows suit this week, expect some gloating.</p> <h2>A merry little retail Christmas<br></h2> <p>While the British drinker seems to be heroically buoying the pubs\u2019 figures, their counterparts sashaying along our high streets have been performing a similar service for our shops.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/m-and-s-christmas-clothing-sales-rise-marks-spencer\">Marks &amp; Spencer has reported its best Christmas </a>in six years, Morrisons its best in seven and Majestic Wine its \u201cbiggest ever\u201d, while even dreary old Debenhams did better than expected.</p> <p>This week we get a host more retailers reporting results, including Greggs, Pets at Home, Halfords and N Brown. There\u2019ll also be data in the form of December\u2019s retail sales from the Office for National Statistics, which curiously might show a slight slip.</p> <p>Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says the seasonally adjusted figures are expected to show that retail sales volumes dipped 0.4% month-on-month in December, although this would still see them up 6.6% year-on-year. Still, he cautions: \u201cThe serious concern for the economy \u2013 and retailers in particular \u2013 is that it looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will weaken markedly over the coming months, with purchasing power being increasingly squeezed and the labour market probably weakening.\u201d Developing.</p> <h2>Is Royal Mail pension still first class?</h2> <p>You might have missed last year\u2019s Pension Scheme of the Year Awards, so here\u2019s a recap: the Royal Mail scooped a hat-trick of gongs for: defined benefit scheme of the year (asset value of over \u00a32.5bn); defined benefit communications (private sector); and best administration.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not letting it go to our heads,\u201d the Royal Mail Pension Plan gushed at the time. \u201cWhile we\u2019re thrilled to win these awards, our focus remains on continuing to improve member outcomes through improving our performance.\u201d</p> <p>Royal Mail staff will no doubt be soothed by those words as they study the group\u2019s trading statement this week, which comes against the backdrop of a potential strike. The company has said it\u2019s considering shutting its final salary pension scheme as, despite a huge surplus, the fund is supposedly running out of cash. So while the trustees might be dedicated to enhancing \u201cmember outcomes\u201d, the firm is targeting the opposite.</p> <p>Or as Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary for postal at the CWU, puts it: \u201cSo we move from shadow boxing to the ring, and negotiations will now begin in earnest ... However, any attempt to introduce any unagreed change by the business would be met with an industrial action ballot.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 15 January 2017 to remove a typo from the headline. </li> </ul>",
