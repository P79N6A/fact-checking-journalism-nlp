      "bodyText": "With the appointment of Angus Taylor as minister for energy, Scott Morrison has clearly signalled that he has no care about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. So utterly bereft of reason on the issue and so completely consumed by climate change denial the government is now at the point where even the pretence of doing something to reduce emissions is viewed with distrust. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly I have a degree of sympathy for members of the public who are climate change deniers. I have this sympathy because I was once one of them. I don\u2019t mean I was a climate change denier in the sense of believing it all was some gigantic hoax perpetrated by the deep state and the UN. I mean denying in the sense of doing my level best to deny it was happening. Because it scared the bejeezus out of me. In the late 1980s and early 1990s when I was finishing high school and studying at university I was of course well aware of climate change. As a politically engaged, super-serious youth who listened to Midnight Oil and U2 and read every newspaper and news magazine I could afford, I was across all the news about the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. And it didn\u2019t sound good. So subconsciously I wanted to ignore it. I would read articles spelling out the dire future ahead and would spend the rest of the day in a depressed funk, because the problem with facing up to the reality of climate change is to face up to the fact that your life thus far has played a role. Your preference for driving a car, the aerosol sprays you used, the food you consumed, or heck, the generation of the electricity you depend upon had all contributed to producing greenhouse gases. It brought with it a level of guilt my 18-year-old self could do without, and even worse, a fear of having to change my lifestyle that I didn\u2019t want to face. And so I would hold on to anything that would suggest it was not so bad. I would cling to those who suggested that each individual couldn\u2019t really make much of a difference (so I can keep those lights switched on). I would inwardly cheer when a friend would (wrongly) suggest he\u2019d read that it was all due to natural factors and things would balance out; or when another would (wrongly) say he\u2019d heard that ironically the hole in the ozone layer apparently cancelled out the impact of global warming, or yet another who would (also wrongly) assert that the changes would in reality be so small that we wouldn\u2019t notice it. And if all else failed I just sighed and thought, well, the impact was likely to happen only by around 2050 or so, and in 1990 to an 18-year-old that meant there was ample time and opportunity for something to get done. Surely a fix would occur \u2013 we always end up finding a fix. And yet ... and yet. I knew I was burying my head in the sand. I was not so much denying the science as wanting to deny reality. The more I read the less able I was to do so. But even now I still get a faint glimmer of hope when I read some dumb article suggesting some research has found evidence that it\u2019s all fine. Because I don\u2019t want climate change to be a real thing. I would love it to all be a hoax. But it is not. And so I understand why people choose to believe those who say climate change is not the issue, that the issue is power prices and thus we need to fire up the coal furnaces. Denial is a very easy way out of guilt that your lifestyle is leaving your children and grandchildren an awful legacy. Denial is a good way to throw away concerns that you might have to actually wear a cost \u2013 either through lifestyle changes or monetary loss. It is a scary thing to hear talk of the impacts of climate change and the suggestions that it might be too late to do anything. It is so much easier to live in denial, especially when you have charlatans in the media and politics who have seen this fear and have sought to profit from it. So I have some sympathy for those who feel overwhelmed by it all. But I have none for those in the media and politics who seek to profit from this fear. There is no excuse for those trying to lull people into believing it is all a great scam, that there is nothing to worry about, or no need for concern, or that little can or should be done. According to Nasa, of the 1,663 months since January 1880, the top 100 for temperature anomaly have all occurred since 1990, and every month since December 2014 is in the top 100. 2018 is on track to be the third-hottest year behind 2016 and 2017; fourth is 2015. It is real, it is happening, it is getting worse and we need to act. And yet this week Taylor gave a speech that made zero mention of wind power \u2013 the main renewable energy in Australia \u2013 and in which he declared he wasn\u2019t sceptical of climate change, just of subsidies for renewable energy, the Gillard government\u2019s emissions trading scheme and of \u201cexcessive renewable energy targets.\u201d This is despite that fact that renewable energy not only reduces our emissions, it also provides cheaper electricity. It\u2019s a bit like the health minister saying she is not an anti-vaxxer, she is just sceptical of the merits of the National Immunisation Program. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s unlikely the Morrison government will withdraw from the Paris agreement, because, why bother? It just won\u2019t do anything to actually ensure our emissions targets are achieved. Rather than risk offending those lunatics in his party who would rather destroy a prime ministership than have a policy with even a slight reference to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Morrison appears to have decided to do nothing. The costs of responding to climate change increase, the longer it is put off by those whose wilful ignorance sees them continue to proffer policy based on the premise that climate change is fake. We have gone from a government under Malcolm Turnbull that at least tried to look like it was aiming to reduce emissions (even if it wasn\u2019t) to one under Scott Morrison that is making no pretence about the fact it is beholden to the charlatans in the party who want to scam votes by lying about the facts of climate change. And a political party that refuses to act on climate change is not fit to govern. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "Pensions tax relief is a juicy morsel for the chancellor should he find a way to make it benefit the exchequer. Even a small slice of the \u00a338bn spent each year subsidising pension saving could help thousands of schools and hundreds of hospitals that would otherwise be starved of cash. A \u00a310bn saving is not outside the bounds of possibility, and that is without even shaking the system to its foundations. All Philip Hammond needs to do in his autumn budget is take away the tax relief top-up offered to higher-rate taxpayers and the \u00a310bn a year can be his. It is a prospect often considered inside the Treasury. And why not, when the people who have benefited the most from this apparently merciful and most charitable form of state aid are the richest in society? It is commonly agreed that around 40% of the \u00a338bn goes to the top 10% of earners, which in today\u2019s money includes all those who earn \u00a370,000 a year or more. That\u2019s a massive bung to the better-off and one that is difficult to justify. There is no reason why someone on the average salary of \u00a327,000 a year should receive 20p in the pound from the government to support their pension saving and someone on \u00a347,000 get 40p. It\u2019s true that they pay tax at these respective rates. And it\u2019s true that the calculation is made easy when the benefit to the taxpayer tallies with the rate at which they pay tax. Yet ease of calculation cannot be a good reason for determining how much support the state offers pension savers. The days of paper ledgers are long gone. There is no excuse. Not even from a tax authority straining under staff shortages. Why, then, does this obvious source of revenue elude one chancellor after another? One reason is the impact on the \u00a32 trillion-plus locked up inside private- and public-sector final salary pension schemes. They have built in to their calculations the higher level of state support for better-paid workers. If it is taken away, their deficits increase dramatically. Then there is the problem that the people who would be most affected \u2013 the better-off \u2013 are also among the most vocal. They pose the same problem when governments consider increasing tax on land and property. They are the owners of property and the owners of pension rights. The message is that any minister who devalues these assets does so at their electoral peril. And what if the chancellor succeeds in withdrawing tax relief? Will the better-off go on a pension strike? In other words, will they cut back on how much they put aside each month if the government\u2019s help is reduced? It\u2019s not an academic point. In other areas where subsidies apply, the decision to reduce or withdraw them often leads to a drop in activity, especially when the activity is investment-related. Solar-panel subsidies are a case in point: when the amount of subsidy per kilowatt-hour was reduced, putting solar panels in a field or on a roof was no longer considered a top investment. The solar industry went into freefall. No chancellor wants to preside over a drop in pensions saving, even if it means that the money is spent on the high street instead and the Treasury not only saves money subsidising pensions, but gets some VAT as well. Yet Hammond should reform pensions tax relief. There is no justification for handing a bigger subsidy to higher-rate taxpayers. It is an arbitrary system that says someone earning \u00a347,000 deserves more support than someone earning \u00a345,000 (the salary at which earners start paying higher-rate tax is \u00a346,351). The Resolution Foundation wants the chancellor to go further and question the entire roster of tax reliefs on offer, which it says added up to \u00a3155bn in the last financial year. Last week it highlighted entrepreneurs\u2019 relief, which cost \u00a32.7bn last year. It described the scheme, which allows people selling companies to pay half the normal rate of capital gains tax (10% rather than the current top rate of 20%) on up to \u00a310m of gains, as \u201cexpensive, ineffective, and regressive\u201d. That same damning criticism can be levelled at pension tax relief and most others on the list. They either enrich wealthy individuals or successful companies. Tax relief on research and development is mostly claimed by the big pharma companies: most small and medium-sized firms don\u2019t get a look-in. And they all share the same underlying thinking, which is that people won\u2019t do the right thing without a huge bung from the government. More specifically, that the better-off won\u2019t go to work, be innovative or save anything for their retirement without government subsidies. It\u2019s time to call their bluff.",

They either enrich wealthy individuals or successful companies. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/corporation-tax-research-and-development-rd-relief\" title=\"\">Tax relief on research and development</a> is mostly claimed by the big pharma companies: most small and medium-sized firms don\u2019t get a look-in.</p> <p>And they all share the same underlying thinking, which is that people won\u2019t do the right thing without a huge bung from the government. More specifically, that the better-off won\u2019t go to work, be innovative or save anything for their&#xa0;retirement without government subsidies.</p> <p>It\u2019s time to call their bluff.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Aston Martin embarked on a mission so fraught with difficulty last week that James Bond himself might balk at the prospect. The carmaker wants to sell at least 25% of its shares to City investors, valuing it at about \u00a35bn, before Britain leaves the EU next March. Aston\u2019s plan to float on the London Stock Exchange comes as much of Britain\u2019s auto industry has sounded the alarm over the potential impact of tariffs and customs checks on their business post-Brexit. BMW, which makes the Mini, has warned that a no-deal Brexit could force UK plant closures; Jaguar Land Rover, which employs 40,000 people in the UK, has also raised concerns, saying a \u201cbad\u201d Brexit deal would threaten \u00a380bn worth of investment plans for the UK and might force it to close factories. So why does Aston Martin think it can dodge the Brexit flak and secure City backing? Andy Palmer, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cI\u2019m not advocating Brexit, trade wars or tariffs. But you have to assume it\u2019s going to happen. The big difference between us and, let\u2019s say, Toyota is that around 25% of our production goes to the EU. Almost all their cars made here are for export to the EU.\u201d Pointing to sterling\u2019s woes since the referendum, he added: \u201cAlso, a weak pound is good for exporters like us. So what you have is something that is relatively safe from Brexit. I think we are insulated from Brexit.\u201d Aston may not export huge numbers of its cars to the EU, but it gets around two-thirds of its parts from the single market. Palmer said the 105-year-old company had increased the amount of stock it will hold \u2013 such as engines from German giant Daimler, which owns 5% of Aston \u2013 from three days\u2019 worth to five days\u2019. \u201cCustoms borders are going to get bloody busy [post-Brexit],\u201d he said. \u201cWe judge that five days of stock will insulate us from stuff being held on to at ports etc.\u201d Palmer hopes a turnaround in financial fortunes, allied with portraying its products as luxury items \u2013 which would command a higher valuation among investors \u2013 will be enough to turn heads in the City. Since 2015, he and his team have been under the bonnet to retune the manufacturer. A turnaround plan has involved cost-cutting, including refinancing expensive debt, and replacing old models with new ones. \u201cBy next year we will have a new SUV [sports utility vehicle] that will be made in our new factory in Wales,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2021-22, we\u2019ll launch the Lagonda SUV and sedan \u2013 both of which will be EVs [electrically powered vehicles].\u201d Palmer said this expansion phase \u2013 launching seven cars in seven years \u2013 would then be repeated. \u201cYou then have the tempo that a successful car company needs,\u201d he said. The financial and operational overhaul has paid dividends. In 2015 and 2016, Aston made cumulative losses of \u00a3290.8m. It reversed the flow last year, clocking up a full-year profit of \u00a384.5m. Last week, it revealed further progress with a first-half pre-tax profit of \u00a320.8m, a slight increase on the \u00a320.3m it recorded a year ago. Half-year revenues were up 8% at \u00a3444.9m. Aston forecasts sales of between 6,200 and 6,400 cars in 2018 after notching up a record 5,098 last year \u2013 its highest total in nine years. Its biggest market is the UK, which accounts for 30% of sales, with the rest of the EU accounting for 25%, followed by the Asia-Pacific region with 24% and the US with 20%. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from selling 3,000 to 3,500 cars a year to almost 7,000 now,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve already doubled our sales rate. Looking ahead, we are aiming to get to 14,000 a year . So, there is potential for prospective shareholders to enjoy some fairly significant growth.\u201d Dr Paul Nieuwenhuis of Cardiff University, a car industry expert, reckons Aston has picked a good moment to float the business. \u201cIf you are going to do that, this is the best time because Aston is doing well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not like an ordinary carmaker \u2013 the margins it makes are much higher than Ford or any of the mass-market manufacturers. Issues such as Brexit are quite different for Aston compared with mainstream manufacturers because it is not as reliant on the EU for sales as the volume producers.\u201d Aston\u2019s owners \u2013 Daimler, the Italian private equity fund Investindustrial, plus several Kuwaiti funds \u2013 were encouraged to pursue a float following the success of Ferrari\u2019s 2015 listing in New York. A \u00a35bn price tag could propel Aston into the FTSE 100 and would value it more highly than its Italian luxury sports car rival \u2013 it suggests Aston would trade on 20 times next year\u2019s expected earnings compared with 15 times for Ferrari. But the racy valuation and timing of the proposed flotation has raised some eyebrows in the car world. A senior industry source said: \u201cI would be surprised if there is sufficient investor appetite for this. Ultimately, Aston depends on Mercedes for its engines, which could cause issues in future. Also, the timing is wrong \u2013 they are doing it just before Brexit, which shows they are extremely worried about the potential impact. This is the last chance to do it before Britain leaves the EU.\u201d Palmer acknowledges the timing was driven by Brexit, but denies it is born out of fear of the potential consequences of Britain leaving the single market. He also notes Daimler will retain its 5% stake after the float, indicating the German group\u2019s long-term commitment to the partnership. \u201cBy the first quarter of 2019, investors are going to be distracted [by Brexit]. It\u2019s better to get this out of the way before then, outside the noise,\u201d he said. Palmer\u2019s mission to elevate Aston Martin alongside Ferrari as a couture brand has taken the carmaker into unfamiliar territory. Aston\u2019s London showroom in affluent Mayfair portrays an aspirational, fashionable lifestyle to its wealthy clientele. Alongside the cars is an Aladdin\u2019s cave of Aston-branded products such as a cashmere stole (\u00a3230) and a picnic hamper (\u00a31,950). There is even a Bond-style, $4m, Aston Martin mini-submarine \u2013 built following interest from the company\u2019s richest, superyacht-owning customers. Palmer will hope his latest mission can attract the same level of admiration from the super-wealthy pension funds of London, New York and Tokyo as Aston Martin\u2019s vehicles do from its moneyed customers.",

      "bodyText": "The majority of big British business leaders are worried about the potential fallout from a no-deal Brexit. But amid the warnings over jobs losses, withheld investments, weaker economic growth and political unrest, some captains of industry are more sanguine. Last week, Aston Martin shrugged off concerns over Brexit damaging the British car industry and announced its flotation plans, while household appliance maker Dyson has earmarked a \u00a3200m expansion of its research campus to test electric cars, with enough space for 2,000 people. Here are some of the British business figures who believe Brexit will not be negative for the economy. Sir James Dyson The billionaire inventor who revolutionised the humble vacuum cleaner was among the most prominent supporters of Brexit before the EU referendum. Dyson, 71, has argued the UK would benefit from setting its own trade policy independently from Brussels. Although his company invests heavily in Britain, his company produces its vacuum cleaners, fans and hairdryers in Asia before exporting them. He has had repeated run-ins with the EU over regulation, including courtroom battles with the EU\u2019s executive arm, the European commission. The British inventor has previously urged ministers to walk away from talks with the EU without a deal, \u201cthey\u2019ll come to us\u201d, arguing that European firms would want to sell their goods in Britain rather than lose market access. Sir Jim Ratcliffe The chairman and founder of the petrochemical firm Ineos is ranked by the Sunday Times as Britain\u2019s richest person, with a fortune estimated at \u00a321bn. Knighted by the Queen earlier this year for services to business and investment, the prominent Brexit supporter is reportedly moving to Monaco for tax purposes. Ineos would not comment on the reports, but stressed that it remained \u201ccommitted\u201d to the UK. Ratcliffe has argued Britain would thrive outside the EU and believes Europe needs the UK market: \u201cNever forget that we have a decent set of cards \u2026 Mercedes is not going to stop selling cars in the UK.\u201d Dame Helena Morrissey The head of personal investing at Legal &amp; General, the FTSE 100 investment management firm, is one of the most high-profile women in the City of London, and one of the most prominent City supporters of Brexit. A staunch advocate for more women in senior corporate positions, this year she launched a pro-Brexit campaign group alongside several other City grandees and academics. She has spoken-out against the \u201ctop-down, command-and-control, one-size-fits-all approach to business and politics\u201d from the EU. Anthony Bamford The chairman of the digger company JCB was among the prominent financial backers of the Vote Leave campaign, and has repeatedly said his company can prosper just as well outside the EU as it does within it. Lord Bamford has said that he voted to stay in the common market in 1975, yet did not vote for political union. He quit the Confederation of British Industry lobby group saying it had ignored the voice of smaller businesses opposed to the EU and had become the voice of multinational firms. JCB was fined \u20ac39.6m (\u00a335.5m) by the European commission in 2000 for antitrust breaches. A major Conservative Party donor, Bamford believes the UK could strike trade deals around the world for the benefit of British businesses. Tim Martin The founder and chairman of the JD Wetherspoon pub chain has begun replacing EU drinks with UK and non-European products, having been a staunch supporter of Brexit since well before the referendum. He has criticised Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan for seeking a deal with \u201cunelected EU representatives\u201d, while arguing that, outside the EU, the UK would be able to remove tariff barriers on imports from countries such as Singapore and Australia, leading to lower prices for British consumers. Simon Wolfson The chairman of the Next retail chain has said that leaving the EU could spark an \u201ceconomic renaissance\u201d for Britain, by enabling trade deals to be struck in emerging markets and allowing the UK to leave behind swaths of regulation. However, he has urged the government not to rush negotiations, warning that the economy would suffer from a botched or rushed deal. A prominent supporter of the Conservative party, Lord Wolfson is in favour of an immigration policy that would give companies access to workers, an open approach to international trade and an orderly transition process as Britain leaves the EU.",

      "bodyText": "US stock markets keep hitting record highs \u2013 as anyone who follows Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account can\u2019t help but notice. And \u201cmore good news is coming\u201d for those who have \u201cmade a fortune\u201d in US stocks, the president promised this week. But behind Trump\u2019s sunny, late summer disposition, there is growing concern that the principal beneficiaries of Trumpian economic largesse are those like him in the uppermost reaches of the economic scale. The top 10% of American households owned 84% of all stocks in 2016, according to a paper by NYU economist Edward Wolff. As the markets have been driven higher by an unprecedented binge in share buybacks, boosted by Trump\u2019s historic corporate tax cuts, those gains have disproportionately gone to the very wealthy. For them \u2013 it\u2019s true \u2013 there is \u201cmore good news\u201d to come. According to a Goldman Sachs report published last month, cash-rich US companies are poised to push $1tn into share buybacks this year. While the same trend can be observed in the UK, Europe and Japan, nowhere is it more hyperactive than in the US, where companies have spent a stunning $5.1tn buying their own shares since 2008. According to a UBS report in June, repurchases are up 83% year to date, far ahead of the 9% gain in dividends. And no one loves share buybacks more than tech, with Apple representing about 20% of the sector\u2019s total with $219bn of share repurchases since 2015, according to its website, and stated plans to allocate $100bn more. Led by Apple, tech buybacks have jumped $160bn in 2018, an increase of more than 200% from 2017. But while shareholders love buybacks, in part because they are often offered at a generous dividend and because they tend to boost stock prices by making shares scarcer, there is growing concern that buybacks are detrimental in social as well as economic terms. In a key 2015 Harvard Business Review study of share buybacks, Profits Without Prosperity, William Lazonick, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell and a leading critic of buyback practice, argued that stock buybacks are \u201ca prime mode of both concentrating income among the richest households and eroding middle-class employment opportunities\u201d. This allocation of earnings, popular with top executives, who are paid primarily in stock options and stock awards, are a key reason why, five years after the official end of the Great Recession, corporate profitability is not translating into widespread economic prosperity, Lazonick argues. The amounts being kicked back to shareholders are indeed staggering. Between 2008 and 2017, he estimates, 466 S&amp;P 500 companies distributed $4tn to shareholders as buybacks, equal to 53% of profits, along with $3.1tn as dividends. Moreover, Lazonick told the Guardian last week, using earnings to fund stock buybacks on the open market eats into investment capital that could otherwise be used by companies to invest in future production capabilities or to incentivize non-executive employees with higher incomes or benefits. \u201cThe financial markets do not allocate capital investment, companies do, so stock buybacks limit capital formation and reduce the earnings a company needs to attract, retain and motivate people,\u201d he said. According to an analysis by JUST Capital, only 6% of the corporate windfall from Trump\u2019s tax cuts has gone to workers in the form of pay hikes, bonuses and other investments. \u201cTo make things worse, in this low interest rate regime of the last decade companies have been borrowing not to leverage retained earnings but to fund buyback schemes,\u201d Lazonick argued. A recent report from the National Employment Law Project calculated that McDonald\u2019s could have paid each of its 1.9 million workers $4,000 more a year if it had used the $21bn it spent between 2015 and 2017 on buybacks to reward its workers instead. Starbucks could have given its workers $7,000. The issue is beginning to attract the attention of Democratic lawmakers. In March, Senator Tammy Baldwin introduced the Reward Work Act that would ban \u201cunjustified\u201d stock buybacks. Leading financial figures are also voicing concern, including the BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, who penned an open letter to corporate America in January. \u201cIt concerns us that, in the wake of the financial crisis, many companies have shied away from investing in the future growth of their companies,\u201d Fink wrote. \u201cToo many companies have cut capital expenditure and even increased debt to boost dividends and increase share buybacks.\u201d While Trump argues that ordinary Americans benefit from the booming stock market \u201cbeyond your wildest dreams\u201d through 401k retirement accounts, only about 52% of families owned stocks directly or indirectly, according to the Federal Reserve. But according to Lazonick, the stock buyback frenzy is the logical extreme of an ideology \u2013 an ideology he describes as \u201cdisastrous\u201d \u2013 that companies should be run to maximize shareholder value. \u201cThis is nothing that Trump created, but it\u2019s the reason the stock market is booming and why, under Trump, there is absolutely no constraint on taking money out of public companies.\u201d",

Leading financial figures are also voicing concern, including the BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, who penned an open letter to corporate America in January.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/jul/17/trump-united-states-tax-reform-plan-greece-commitment-to-reducing-inequality-cri-index\">Trump's tax proposal would push US below Greece on inequality index</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt concerns us that, in the wake of the financial crisis, many companies have shied away from investing in the future growth of their companies,\u201d Fink wrote. \u201cToo many companies have cut capital expenditure and even increased debt to boost dividends and increase share buybacks.\u201d</p> <p>While Trump argues that ordinary Americans benefit from the booming stock market \u201cbeyond your wildest dreams\u201d through 401k retirement accounts, only about 52% of families owned stocks directly or indirectly, according to the Federal Reserve.</p> <p>But according to Lazonick, the stock buyback frenzy is the logical extreme of an ideology \u2013 an ideology he describes as \u201cdisastrous\u201d \u2013 that companies should be run to maximize shareholder value.</p> <p>\u201cThis is nothing that Trump created, but it\u2019s the reason the stock market is booming and why, under Trump, there is absolutely no constraint on taking money out of public companies.\u201d</p>",
