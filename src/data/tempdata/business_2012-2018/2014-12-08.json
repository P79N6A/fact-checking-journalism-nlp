    "webTitle": "Greece gets bailout extension, and brings forward presidential poll", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s drive to exit its bailout programme has taken a dramatic twist tonight, putting the country\u2019s political stability back in the spotlight. The drama began this evening when Eurozone finance ministers decided to allow Athens a two-month extension to its current loans programme, which was due to run out at the end of December. This is designed to give Greece time to meet the outstanding demands of the Troika, and means it will not exit part of its four-year bailout by the new year, as it hoped. The extension will also allow the lenders more time to assess if a black hole is lurking in Greece\u2019s 2015 budget. And shortly afterwards, Greeks were stunned to learn that the upcoming presidential election will be brought forward. This ballot, involving members of parliament, is on a knife-edge, given the coalition\u2019s thin majority in parliament. The first ballot takes place on December 17. With barely a week to go, we don\u2019t know who any of the candidates are, but PM Antonis Samaras is due to reveal his choice on Tuesday. A spokesman said the move will: \u201cprevent the opposition from undermining Greece\u2019s economy and directing messages of political uncertainty to financial markets\u201d. If Samaras cannot secure the support of three fifths of MPs by a third vote, on December 27th or 29th (reports vary), then he could be forced to call early elections. Given he has 155 seats in the 300-strong parliament, the vote could be close.... Economists and analysts say the next few weeks will be dramatic. It could result in the left-wing Syriza party taking power. Syriza, indeed, has already predicted that Samaras simply doesn\u2019t have the votes to win the presidential ballot. Syriza wants a debt restructuring to put Greece on a firmer footing, which could create another chapter in the ongoing eurozone crisis. Do scroll back through the blog for more expert reaction and early analysis. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning to cover full reaction to the latest developments. Goodnight! GW Here\u2019s a photo from inside the eurogroup meeting of finance ministers today: And here\u2019s the press conference, where we learned Greece has been given two more months to tie up the outstanding measures demanded by its lenders: A couple more names in the mix for the presidential race that dramatically opened up tonight. Another possible presidential candidate, apparently, is former prime minister Kostas Karamanlis. Karamanlis was Greek PM in a New Democracy (ND) government until autumn 2009, when he called an snap election after the full scale of Greece\u2019s debt crisis began to emerge. He lost to the left-wing Pasok party, which went on to agree two bailout packages and deep austerity, before being replaced by a technocratic leader in 2011. Samaras\u2019s ND party then won power, in a coalition, the next June. It\u2019s not immediately clear who might take on the heady role of being Greece\u2019s next president. Which is remarkable, given the first poll is just nine days away! Antonis Samaras\u2019s spokeswoman Sofia Voultepsi has apparently told local media that no candidates have been named yet; the PM\u2019s speech tomorrow should shed some light. Brussels insiders are suggesting commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, according to the FT\u2019s ever-well-informed Peter Spiegel: Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, has just discussed the Greek developments on Al Jazeera (you can hear it here). She explains that a bailout extension was \u201cinevitable\u201d (as Greece had not satisfied its lenders that it had hit the targets agreed under its bailout). Greece still has work to do, she added: I think a number of structural reforms still need to be implemented. A lot of have been legislated, but not implemented Megan also predicted that Greece probably need a precautionary credit line even if it does exit its bailout in late February 2015. That would be a line of credit in case it couldn\u2019t borrow in the money markets. Things are moving fast: The opposition Syriza party, which is leading the Greek opinion polls, has reportedly predicted snap elections in Greece: For that to happen, the government would have to fail three times to get a presidential candidate endorsed by parliament, on votes on December 17, 22, and 27th (although some reports say 29th).... They need the support of three-fifths of MPs, so 180 of the 300 members of parliament. Currently, the coalition government only holds 155 seats.... Financial analyst Jens Bastian predicts a dramatic run-up to Christmas. The BBC\u2019s Mark Lowen, who covered the 2012 Greek debt crisis from Athens, agrees that Greece is back in the spotlight: Bringing forward the Greek presidential elections to the end of December (they were due in February) is a \u201cgamble\u201d by prime minister Samaras, says Associated Press. Here\u2019s their early take: Greece\u2019s conservative-led government has called for a vote in parliament for the country\u2019s new president late this month - in a surprise move that will determine its survival in the recession-weary country. Government spokesman Sofia Voultepsi said late Monday the vote would be held Dec. 17, with possible later rounds held through Dec. 22. The vote had not been expected to be held until late February. The government needs support from opposition lawmakers to avoid a stalemate and a snap general election, but is trailing in opinion polls to the anti-bailout Syriza party and facing widespread public discontent after a six-year recession. Earlier Monday, Eurozone bailout lenders backed a Greek request to extend the rescue lending program for another two months. Did eurozone finance ministers know that Greece was bringing forward its presidential elections, when they agreed to give Athens another two months to deliver the reforms demanded by its Troika of lenders? Eurozone crisis expert Yannis Koutsomitis wonders what happened behind the scenes..... Nick Malkoutzis of the Kathimerini newspaper explains that the December presidential vote will decide whether prime minister Antonis Samaras will conclude negotiations with the Troika, during the two-month bailout extension agreed tonight: More reaction: Reuters reports that Greece will formally ask for a two-month bailout extension tomorrow -- which is a formality now that eurogroup officials have said they\u2019d accept it. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Euro zone finance ministers are in favour of granting Greece a two-month extension of its bailout program, which Athens will ask for on Tuesday, Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Monday. The EU had considered extending the current bailout by six months to mid-2015, a document obtained by Reuters showed last week. But Athens had said it was only willing to consider extending the unpopular programme by a few weeks. \u201cWe need an extension,\u201d Dijsselbloem said after euro zonefinance ministers discussed the bailout plan, pointing out that it would not be possible to conclude a review of the program before year-end. \u201cLet\u2019s do this as quickly as we can, and in our mind that is two months,\u201d he added. \u201cTwo months is long enough to complete review and not too long to leave questions open for the future.\u201d More here: Greece to get two-month bailout extension -Eurogroup\u2019s Dijsselbloem Hello again. Some late news breaking involving Greece. Over in Brussels, eurogroup ministers have agreed to give the Greek government a two-month extension to its bailout. That gives Greece until the end of February to reach agreement with its troika of lenders over the outstanding parts of its loan deal, which was due to expire at the end of December. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem explained (via the FT). \u201cDespite its progress, there\u2019s not enough [done] at this point to conclude this review now or by the end of the year.\u201d A formal request from Athens will come on Tuesday morning, according to Reuters. And a few minutes later, Athens announced that it is bringing forward elections to choose its next president. They will begin on December 17, with a second poll on December 22 and a third on December 27. This is a key test for prime minister Antonis Samaras, given his small majority in parliament. If he can\u2019t gather enough support to win the third ballot (a majority of three-fifths of MPs is needed), Greece would presumably head to the polls for an general election. And currently, the radical left-wing Syriza party is leading in the opinion polls. It argues that Greece needs debt relief; a prospect that has alarmed some investors in recent days. After some calm months, the Greek crisis is back on the agenda. Here\u2019s some instant reaction from experts on twitter: GW More reaction to follow..... Weak Chinese trade data and news that Japan had fallen into a deeper recession than expected, not to mention continued weakness in the eurozone has sent shares sharply lower. Commodity companies in particular have come under pressure, with Brent crude falling around 4% to a new five year low of $66.35 a barrel on fears of falling demand and oversupply. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 70.69 points or 1.05% at 6672.15 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.72% to 10014.99 France\u2019s Cac closed 1% lower at 4375.48 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.68% to 19,951.15 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.88% at 10,805.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 60 points or 0.33%. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. The US Federal Reserve should be on track to raise interest rates in the latter half of 2015, according to Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart. But in a speech to a symposium in Atlanta he said with the recent improvements in the economy, including the jobs market, it was a concern that inflation had not yet picked up. He said (courtesy Reuters): Simultaneous readings of robust job creation...and weak inflation readings are somewhat puzzling. [But] the momentum I perceive in the economy gives me confidence that the Federal Open Market Committee can consider beginning to normalise interest rates in 2015. More on the Greece deliberations: It appears Greece\u2019s bailout may indeed get an extension: Financial stability is improving at European banks but the sector is still vulnerable, ratings agency Moody\u2019s has said. In a new report it said: In most European banking systems, financial stability is improving, but rising bail-in risks and weak profits pose challenges. New EU-wide regulation has enforced higher capital levels, which, through de-risking and better asset-liability matching will improve bank performance, longer term. However, weak macroeconomic conditions weigh on Europe\u2019s banking sector, and low overall bottom lines implies that the European banking industry remains structurally vulnerable. \u201cWeak macroeconomic conditions will continue to weigh on Europe\u2019s banking sector in 2015 and banks\u2019 low overall profitability implies that Europe\u2019s banking sector remains structurally vulnerable, meaning that we may see banks making further adjustments to their costs and possibly changes to their business models. European banks\u2019 bottom lines should benefit from declining provisioning costs in 2015, but conduct and litigation charges will remain high,\u201d says Carola Schuler, a Managing Director in Moody\u2019s EMEA Financial Institutions Group. Also, given the pending EU bail-in regime, benign funding costs are likely to rise. It remains to be seen whether banks will be able to pass on to their customers the higher cost of regulation and in particular, any bail-in costs. The full statement is here: Mostly negative European banking system outlooks in 2015 owing to new bail-in regimes, despite improving financial stability Over in Greece officials are putting a positive spin on events today in Brussels. But government insiders are also saying that much will depend on discussions later this week in Berlin. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Although hopes have been dashed that decisive decision-making will be the order of the day as euro area finance ministers hold their working session, the Greek government is expressing optimism that headway will be made. \u201cWe expect some progress on the basis of what has been said already at the Eurogroup which has called for the speedy completion of the [economic] review which must be concluded in December,\u201d the government spokesperson Sophia Voultepsi told Real radio station. \u201cMr Moscovici, himself, said \u2018we want to go in the direction of exiting the difficulties Greece is facing,\u2019\u201d she added, referring to statements made earlier by the EU commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs. Well-placed sources said auditors representing the country\u2019s troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF may ever return to Athens \u201cas soon as tomorrow\u201d in a bid to wrap up the review. Despite all evidence to the contrary, Greek officials are also denying that euro area finance ministers are contemplating extending the country\u2019s unpopular bailout programme by six months \u2013 a nightmare scenario for the ruling coalition. With the radical left main opposition Syriza party leading in the polls, the government has staked its survival on a hasty retreat from international surveillance. Prior to his departure to Brussels, the finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis rejected suggestions that the program would be prolonged until mid-2015 \u2013 although he stopped short of denying that it could be extended through to March. \u201cI am convinced that the process of the final review will end soon with a positive result,\u201d he told the Greek parliament late Sunday hours before it voted through next year\u2019s budget. Acknowledging that relations with the troika are \u201cvery tense\u201d officials conceded that passage of the budget would be likely to exacerbate negotiations further. Both sides are still at loggerheads over how to plug a fiscal gap in 2015 that the troika maintains is almost certain to be bigger than government forecasts. Greece\u2019s deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos will also attempt to smooth ruffled feathers when he holds talks with the German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble in Berlin on Wednesday. In blunt comments earlier today, Schauble said there was little chance Athens would receive its last tranche of EU aid by the end of the year. \u201cGermany, and Schauble in particular, has been very irritated by our desire to exit the bailout by the end of the year,\u201d a senior insider conceded. \u201cVenizelos will explain the environment in Greece to Schauble and underline the dangers of being pushed too far. There are dangers not just for Greece but all of the euro zone if there is a change [of government] and Syriza comes to power,\u201d he said. \u201cSchauble calls the shots and it is going to be a very important meeting.\u201d Oil continues to slide on worries about oversupply and falling demand, with Brent crude now down 4% to $66 a barrel, a new five year low. The latest drop follows the weak economic data from China and Japan, raising fears about the state of the global economy. Morgan Stanley reckons prices could fall as low as $35 briefly, lagging any intervention by Opec which would probably have been made by then. The bank said: With Opec on the sidelines, oil prices face their greatest threat since 2009, but we expect a volatile 2015 rather than a one-way trade. Without intervention, physical markets and prices will face serious pressure, with the second quarter of 2015 likely marking the peak period of dislocation. But unlike 2009, this is a self-inflicted \u201ccrisis\u201d, and the coming oversupply is grossly exaggerated. With only a modest fix required, the market is complacent about potential upside risk, particularly in light of lower prices. We see several factors that could contribute to recovery, potentially as early as 2H15, especially on a constant-currency basis. Outage risks rise with low prices, effective spare capacity is near zero and Opec or non-Opec intervention (less supply) is still possible. Sustained low prices also risk a supply crunch by 2017 or 2018 related to insufficient investment. Although near- term fundamentals are less concerning, the risk of material oversupply is high by the second quarter of 2015. Even though dislocations are unlikely to match prior crises, the market is primed to sell any sign of trouble. The only true floor in an oversupplied market is cash cost (around $35-40 a barrel). We would expect Opec intervention or lost production to prevent this, but the lagged fundamental impact and sentiment could push prices to these levels for a brief period. The bank cut its average Brent base-case forecast by $28 to $70 a barrel for 2015 and by $14 to $88 for 2016. Meanwhile Opec member Kuwait said oil prices were likely to remain around $65 a barrel for the next few months. Eurozone finance ministers, currently meeting in Brussels, will not make any decision on extending Greece\u2019s bailout programme, Greek newspaper Kathimerini is reporting: The European Union is considering extending the current bailout by six months to mid-2015, a document obtained by Reuters showed last week. But Athens says it is only willing to consider extending the unpopular program by a few weeks. \u201cWhat we really want is to reach good agreements that allow Greece to cut its deficit and carry out the right reforms that will allow it to have a solid economy,\u201d EU Commissioner for Economics and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici told reporters on Monday before a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. \u201cThere will be no decision today on an extension of the Greek (bailout) program but I hope a few steps forward will be registered,\u201d Moscovici said, adding he was well aware of the efforts made by Greece. Greece\u2019s parliament approved next year\u2019s budget in the early hours of Monday, the plan being closest to a balanced budget Greece has produced in more than three decades. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is struggling to push through an early exit from the bailout and ensure the survival of his government after a presidential vote next year. A row with the EU and IMF over a disputed budget shortfall next year has held up the country\u2019s final bailout inspection and plans to exit the aid program. Greece\u2019s lenders are demanding \u20ac1.7bn (\u20ac1.08bn) in additional measures to hit budget targets next year, something Athens has rejected. Over in the US and Wall Street has edged lower in common with other global markets, following the disappointing Chinese and Japanese data. The fall in crude oil prices amid continuing talk of oversupply has sent energy shares lower, while McDonald\u2019s has lost around 3% in early trading after a bigger than expected decline in like for like sales. Despite all that, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is bearing up reasonably well and is currently down 17 points or 0.09%. The European Central Bank has released details of its latest covered bonds and asset backed securities programme: Over in Brussels and the Eurogroup has said that none of the draft budget plans produced were in \u201cserious non-compliance\u201d with the stability and growth pact. So no country was required to resubmit its budget. There were risks in some cases, however. Regarding Italy, for example, the Eurogroup said: We agree with the European Commission\u2019s assessment that the budget is at risk of non- compliance with the requirements of the stability and growth pact. While we acknowledge that the unfavourable economic circumstances and the very low inflation rate have complicated the achievement of the debt reduction benchmark and full compliance with the debt rule appears very demanding at this point, the high debt level remains a matter of concern. We note that according to the latest Commission assessment, Italy\u2019s structural fiscal effort in 2015 will be 0.1% of GDP, whereas 0.5% of GDP is required under the preventive arm. On that basis, effective measures would be needed to allow for an improvement of the structural effort. And elsewhere: The full statement is here (PDF). There are plenty of reasons behind McDonald\u2019s disappointing sales figures in recent months. One theory is that lower-income households have not seen their earnings pick up in line with economic growth. Another is that its customer base is switching to alternative fast foot outlets, as Chelsey Dulaney of Marketwatch explains: An increasingly complicated menu has slowed service in the U.S. as McDonald\u2019s once-reliable base of younger customers have also defected to fast-casual chains boasting customized ordering and fresh ingredients, including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., and specialty-burger chains such as Five Guys. November\u2019s weak sales are part of a broader trend at McDonald\u2019s, flags up Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Weisenthal. McDonald\u2019s has also reminded investors of the problems it has suffered in China. Back in the summer, a TV investigation showed that a major supplier had been repackaging meat that had passed its expiry date. Operations at the plant were halted, leaving many McDonald\u2019s outlets in China unable to sell items such as burgers and chicken nuggets. Its Japanese restaurants also stopped importing chicken from China. The \u201congoing impact of the supplier issue in China\u201d will knock $0.07 to $0.10 per share of its profits in the current quarter, it says. Oh dear. McDonald\u2019s latest sales figures are out, and they\u2019re not a pretty sight. Global sales at the fast food giant fell by 2.2% on a comparable basis in November (ie, stripping out new stores). In America, like-for-like sales fell by 4.6%. In Europe, comparable sales are down 2.0%. And across Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa they fell 4.0% McDonald\u2019s also warned that the strengthening of the US dollar against \u201cnearly all foreign currencies\u201d will have a negative impact on its profits (as takings at overseas outlets are worth less in dollar terms). It\u2019s the latest in a string of disappointing results from the company. President and CEO Don Thompson insisted that McDonald\u2019s is making changes, both in America: To restore momentum, McDonald\u2019s U.S. is diligently working to enhance its marketing, simplify the menu, and implement a more locally-driven organizational structure to increase relevance with consumers. And in Europe: Europe\u2019s comparable sales decreased 2.0% in November as positive performance in the U.K. was more than offset by very weak results in Russia and negative results in France and Germany. While the operating environment remains challenging across most of the segment, McDonald\u2019s Europe remains focused on providing customers with locally-relevant value and premium menu options, including differentiated beverage and breakfast offerings. Investors are not, er, loving it -- shares have fallen 2.5% in pre-market trading. It\u2019s been a generally downbeat morning, and that\u2019s reflected in Europe\u2019s stock markets. Weak Asian data overnight, gloomy warnings from the ECB\u2019s Ewald Nowotny and the OECD, and the latest fall in the oil price are all weighing on shares. And there\u2019s also jitteriness after the influential Bank for International Settlements warned that the strength of the US dollar could cause turmoil in emerging markets: Strong dollar threatens global economy, warns BIS The main indices all remain in the red as lunchtime approaches in the City. So, a quick recap. Austrian central bank chief Ewald Nowotny has warned of a \u2018massive weakening\u2019 in the eurozone economy, with growth and inflation both slowing. He warned: \u201cWe see a massive weakening in the euro zone economy.\u201d Nowotny also waded into the row over whether the ECB should launch a big government bond-buying programme, saying QE could be a \u201cvaluable\u201d tool. The OECD\u2019s latest data has shown that growth is weakening in Europe, led by Germany and France. Composite leading indicators (CLIs), designed to anticipate turning points in economic activity relative to trend, suggest that growth will continue to lose momentum in Europe while the outlook is for stable growth momentum in most other major economies and in the OECD area as a whole. Japan is deeper in recession than first thought; updated GDP data showed it contracted at an annual rate of 1.9% between July and September. And China has reported a drop in export growth, and a fall in imports. This cocktail of bad news pushed the oil price steadily down - Brent crude fell below the $67/barrel mark a few minutes ago, a new five-year low. And the dollar has continued to rally today, making fresh gains against emerging currencies: The OECD has piled fresh pressure on the ECB, and eurozone politicians, by warning that the euro economy is slowing. Echoing Ewald Nowotny\u2019s concerns today, the Paris-based organisation predicted that \u201cgrowth will continue to lose momentum in Europe\u201d, particularly in Germany and Italy. France\u2019s growth momentum will be \u201cstable\u201d, it suggested, while UK will also ease back after robust growth. The broader outlook is for \u201cstable growth momentum in most other major economies and in the OECD area as a whole\u201d, it said in its latest Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) (which are online here). The OECD sees: Stable growth momentum in the United States, Canada, China and Brazil while tentative signs of a positive change in momentum are emerging in Japan. The CLI for Russia points to growth tentatively losing momentum. India is the only major economy where the CLI points to a clear pick-up in growth momentum. Here\u2019s the state of play: OECD Area: Stable growth momentum Euro Area: Growth losing momentum Canada: Stable growth momentum France: Stable growth momentum Japan: Tentative signs of a positive change in momentum Germany: Growth losing momentum Italy: Weakening momentum United Kingdom: Easing growth United States: Stable growth momentum Brazil: Stable growth momentum China: Stable growth momentum India: Growth gaining momentum Russia: Growth tentatively losing momentum Over in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers have convened for the monthly Eurogroup meeting. They\u2019ll be considering what to do about Greece. The Greek government passed its 2015 budget last night but has not yet reached agreement with its lenders to unlock its last aid payment from Europe. Greece has admitted that \u2018technical problems\u2019 might mean the bailout lasts a few more weeks; some eurozone officials are reportedly considering a six-month extension. The oil price is weakening this morning, hitting new five-year lows on speculation that a supply glut is building up. Brent crude hit $67.35 per barrel, the lowest since October 2009. It offers consumers around the globe the prospect of cheaper fuel and energy bills, and also poses more deflationary problems for central bankers. Today\u2019s weaker-than-expected Chinese import and export data is also pushing down the oil price, as it may indicate the global economy is slowing. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, comments: Last night\u2019s high jump in China\u2019s trade balance figures has seen commodity and mining stocks in the FTSE lose some of their appeal. Austria\u2019s Ewald Nowotny has gone on to express support for a full-blown quantitative easing programme in the eurozone: Reuters has the details: Extending European Central Bank asset purchases to government bonds, or quantitative easing, can play a valuable role in addressing the economic weakness of the euro zone, a senior ECB policymaker and head of Austria\u2019s central bank said on Monday. Asked whether a programme of quantitative easing would be sensible in addressing the weakness of the euro zone\u2019s economy, Ewald Nowotny said: \u201cAs a supportive measure in the context of a comprehensive plan, it can certainly be valuable.\u201d (scroll back to earlier post for Nowotny\u2019s earlier comments) Ewald Nowotny also warned that there is a \u201chigh probability\u201d that eurozone inflation would slow further in the coming months, from 0.3% in November. That makes sense, given recent tumbles in energy prices. Credit Agricole suggested last week that eurozone inflation could dip briefly below zero in early 2015. The latest ECB staff forecasts, though, reckon it won\u2019t: This chart shows how Ewald Nowotny\u2019s dovish comments has pushed the euro down to its lowest point since August 2012: A senior European Central Bank policymaker has warned that the eurozone economy is suffering a \u201cmassive weakening\u201d, sending the euro down to a new two-year low. Ewald Nowotny, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, threw his weight behind president Mario Draghi\u2019s plan to drastically expand the ECB\u2019s balance sheet, despite opposition. Nowotny also indicated that a full-blown QE programme may be needed. He told a conference in Frankfurt that: \u201cWe see a massive weakening in the euro zone economy.\u201d adding: \u201cThe balance sheet of the ECB should reach the levels at the start of 2012, a level which is around 1 trillion euros higher than it is now,\u201d Last week, the ECB was split down the middle over this issue. Half of the six-strong executive board opposed Draghi\u2019s decision to make the \u20ac1trn balance sheet expansion an \u2018expectation\u2019, not a mere \u2018intention\u2019. According to Reuters, Nowotny (who is Austria\u2019s central bank chief) said that the main focus of discussion on any further ECB asset purchases would be on buying sovereign bonds. The pros and cons of such a move into full-blown quantitative easing would be debated, he added. (debated fiercely, I\u2019d suggest). This has sent the euro down to $1.2253 against the US dollar, a new two-year low. Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have fallen over 3% this morning, after it made a stumbling start to the crucial Christmas period. Problems at M&amp;S\u2019s Castle Donington distribution centre has forced it to delay online orders for several days, up to a fortnight in some cases. As my colleague Sarah Butler reported last night: Disappointed customers have been complaining on social media about delays to their orders which have been caused by problems at the retailer\u2019s distribution centre in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, which opened in May last year. While some orders have been delayed by up to two weeks, next-day deliveries to customers\u2019 homes have been taking up to two or three days and M&amp;S has withdrawn its next-day deliveries to stores. The company admitted it had been forced to extend delivery times after its Black Friday weekend promotions as its distribution centre could not keep up with demand. Full story: Marks and Spencer customers hit by delays to online shopping orders One example: Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets confirms that the gloomy news from Asia has dampened the mood in Europe\u2019s markets: An implosion in Chinese trade data and a bigger than expected Japanese contraction in the third quarter demonstrate the constraints that Asia\u2019s two largest economies are putting on global growth. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees that the \u201chost of disappointing macro-economic data overnight\u201d has hit sentiment: Japanese GDP confirmed that Q3\u2019s recession is worse than previously estimated (annual and quarterly) along with a worsening October Trade deficit and decline in November business sentiment surveys. This is coupled with a Chinese November Trade Surplus rising to an unexpected record high, but at the expense of growth in both exports and import, with the former slowing markedly and the latter actually dropping into contraction suggesting a worsening of the slowing growth trend in the world\u2019s second largest economy. China\u2019s stock market spiked after its disappointing trade data hit the wires. The main Shanghai index leapt by over 4%, driven by predictions that the Beijing government might launch more stimulus measures. China\u2019s stock market has been on an absolute tear in recent weeks, seemingly driven by a surge of retail investors, as these tweets show: The triple-whammy of bad news from Japan, China and Europe has hit Europe\u2019s stock markets. The main indices are all in the red: The FTSE 100 is down 28 points, or -0.4%, at 6715. The German DAX is down 25 points, or -025%, at 10061. The French CAC is down 16 points, or 0.4%, at 4402. The third piece of gloomy news this morning comes from China. The latest trade data was much weaker than expected, bolstering fears that the world economy is slowing. Chinese exports rose by just 4.7% in November compared with a year ago, barely half as much as expected. And imports fell by 6.7% year-on-year. That left it with a huge trade surplus of over $54bn, and left economists fretting that China, and the global economy, are both slowing: Associated Press explains: The decline in trade numbers probably was due in part to a crackdown aimed at ending misreporting by traders as a way to evade Chinese capital controls, but also indicates the underlying activity is weakening, said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. \u201cThe magnitude of the fall suggests that underlying export growth has weakened too,\u201d said Evans-Pritchard. As for imports, \u201cthe sharp fall also hints at a further cooling of domestic demand. Full story: Surprise fall in China imports as exports also slow Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, is hoping that Germany\u2019s \u201csoft spell\u201d is coming to an end, despite October\u2019s small rise in industrial production. The German economy should soon benefit from the weak euro and falling oil prices, something he dubs \u201ca very special stimulus package\u201d: As experienced in the past, the German economy is one of main beneficiaries from lower energy prices and a weaker exchange rate. This positive effect should start to kick in in the coming months. And that would presumably further dampen any enthusiasm for other stimulus packages, such as a QE programme from the ECB.... The early news from Europe isn\u2019t too cheery either; German industrial production rose by less than expected in October. New figures showed that industrial output rose by just 0.2% in October, missing forecasts of growth of up to 0.4%. And September\u2019s figure have been revised down, from a 1.4% increase to 1.1%. It suggests Europe\u2019s largest economy struggled to bounce back strongly from its summer slowdown, having narrowly avoided a recession. Ulrike Kastens, economist at Sal Oppenheim, says: \u201cGerman industry had a weak start to the fourth quarter but given the better order levels, we expect a strong development in the coming months.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A new week begins with bad news from Japan, which is deeper in recession than first feared. Revised data published overnight shows that the Japanese economy shrank at a annual rate of 1.9% in the third quarter of 2014. That dashes hopes that the first estimate, of a 1.6% contraction, would be revised higher. Alarmingly, business spending contracted by 0.4%, compared to a first estimate of a 0.2% fall. Economists expected it to have recovered, by 0.9%. And private consumption was also weak, growing by 0.4% after plunging 5.1% in the second quarter. The figures come as Japan prepares to head to the polls for a snap election. Prime minister Shinzo Abe is looking for a mandate to delay the sales tax hike due next year. But this economic weakness also shows that Abe\u2019s three-pronged strategy of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms hasn\u2019t paid off. Also coming up today... In the eurozone, finance ministers will be holding their monthly Eurogroup meeting in Brussels. They\u2019ll be considering member states\u2019 draft budgets for 2015 (details here), and also whether to extend Greece\u2019s bailout. Last night, the Greek parliament voted through its 2015 budget, with prime minister Antonis Samaras declaring that: \u201cWe are exiting the era when bond markets were closed to us and we needed bailout loans to survive\u201d. But with Greece\u2019s 10-year bond yields still in the \u201cdanger zone\u201d over 7%, and a nail-biting vote over the next president looming, the country\u2019s future still looks scary. And in the UK parliament, PricewaterhouseCoopers and drugs giant Shire face tough questioning on tax avoidance from the Public Accounts committee, from 3.15pm (details).",

Without intervention, physical markets and prices will face serious pressure, with the second quarter of 2015 likely marking the peak period of dislocation. But unlike 2009, this is a self-inflicted \u201ccrisis\u201d, and the coming oversupply is grossly exaggerated. With only a modest fix required, the market is complacent about potential upside risk, particularly in light of lower prices. We see several factors that could contribute to recovery, potentially as early as 2H15, especially on a constant-currency basis.</p> <p>Outage risks rise with low prices, effective spare capacity is near zero and Opec or non-Opec intervention (less supply) is still possible. Sustained low prices also risk a supply crunch by 2017 or 2018 related to insufficient investment.</p> <p>Although near- term fundamentals are less concerning, the risk of material oversupply is high by the second quarter of 2015. Even though dislocations are unlikely to match prior crises, the market is primed to sell any sign of trouble.</p> <p>The only true floor in an oversupplied market is cash cost (around $35-40 a barrel).

Their situation near such infrastructure and also near industrialised areas also means they have access to a large market for engineering and construction companies and workers.</p> <p>BREE does not expect this to hamper the Australian LNG industry, but it concluded that while LNG projects in Australia \u201chave a number of competitive advantages\u201d, there \u201cis a strong incentive on all project proponents to keep costs under control\u201d.</p> <p>But the report highlights that future bountiful riches from the LNG sector are not set in stone and, falling oil prices, new competition from the US and lower than expected demand, all serve to highlight that as with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/dec/04/australias-dreadful-gdp-figures-six-things-you-need-to-know\">iron ore boom</a>, the exports of LNG will be subject to more uncertainty than was the case with mining investment during the early-mid 2000s mining boom. </p> <p>And in light of the expected massive downgrades in revenue to come in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, it means governments will need to be very cautious when predicting booms in revenue to flow into their budgets from the LNG industry. </p>",

But the falling oil price along with the falls in other commodities, will reduce the profits and thus company tax revenue \u2013 the May Budget predicted oil prices to be around US$113 a barrel. Secondly, just as the falling iron ore prices has put into question the viability of some smaller higher cost iron ore miners, because the price of LNG in Japan is linked to the oil price, the falling oil price will put pressure on the profitability of the LNG projects currently in development in Queensland and northern Australia. This industry is being touted as the next big mining boom \u2013 fuelling large investment at a time when investment in mining in iron ore is falling. The new port in Gladstone is also geared to open the eastern Australian gas market to the world and fuel a large growth in exports But just as Saudi Arabia and other oil producing nations are facing new competition from the US shale oil, Australian LNG producers will soon face competition from the US shale gas industry. The annual gas market report released by the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics (BREE) two weeks ago highlighted the cost pressures Australian gas producers face. BREE noted that while \u201cAustralia is on track to become the world\u2019s largest exporter of LNG before the end of this decade\u201d, there will also be increasing competition from new entrants\u201d \u2013 namely from the US. Currently exports to Japan from the US south or east are hampered by the constraints of the Panama Canal. But the Panama Canal is due to be expanded by 2016 and then the exports to Asia of LNG from Louisiana will be competing with those from Australia. By 2030, BREE estimates Australia and the US will export roughly the same amount of LNG to Japan: Currently the price of LNG in Japan is kept in line with the oil price. Even with the drop in oil prices causing a fall in the price of LNG in Japan to US$13.86 per million British thermal units, it remains well above the US price of US$4.10.

BREE suggests a price for the Japanese market of the US price plus around US$6 would be set \u2013 meaning the prices for LNG in Japan would be about 25% lower than it is now. This places significant pressures on Australia LNG suppliers to keep costs down to compete globally. BREE found that the cost of supplying LNG to Japan from Australia is around 36% more than it will be for LNG from Louisiana: The production and liquefaction of the gas \u2013 which accounts for 80%-90% of the total cost \u2013 is much costlier in Australia than the US. BREE noted that the main problem for the Australian LNG industry was distance and newness. Unlike most major new Australian gas projects, such as the Gorgon gas project located off Barrow Island, the US shale gas projects are being built in industrialised areas. As a result they don\u2019t have to build everything from scratch and can access established infrastructure \u2013 such as \u201cregasification\u201d terminals, pipelines and ports. Their situation near such infrastructure and also near industrialised areas also means they have access to a large market for engineering and construction companies and workers. BREE does not expect this to hamper the Australian LNG industry, but it concluded that while LNG projects in Australia \u201chave a number of competitive advantages\u201d, there \u201cis a strong incentive on all project proponents to keep costs under control\u201d. But the report highlights that future bountiful riches from the LNG sector are not set in stone and, falling oil prices, new competition from the US and lower than expected demand, all serve to highlight that as with the iron ore boom, the exports of LNG will be subject to more uncertainty than was the case with mining investment during the early-mid 2000s mining boom. And in light of the expected massive downgrades in revenue to come in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, it means governments will need to be very cautious when predicting booms in revenue to flow into their budgets from the LNG industry.",

She is to be replaced by Jon Morrell, currently managing director of esure broker and esure\u2019s deputy chief operating officer. The acquisition is subject to approval by the Competition and Markets Authority.</p> <h2>Immortalised in song </h2> <p>Hayley Parsons\u2019 home of Newport was immortalised in song in the Alicia Keys parody as a \u201cconcrete jumble, nothing in order, not far from the border\u201d: the broader joke being any comparison between the small south Wales city and the opportunities offered by New York. Well, go compare. Parsons, 41, took eight years to turn an idea planned at her kitchen table into a \u00a3200m company based in her town \u2013 and make herself a fortune. The mother of two, born in nearby Cwmbran, left her Newport comprehensive at 16 with five GCSEs, having once hoped to have been an interior designer. Instead she joined insurance firm Admiral where she worked for the next 14 years, helping launch its own pioneering price comparison site, confused.com. In 2006, Parsons left to pursue her own vision of how to do something similar, but better.</p> <p>A stand-out success in a male-dominated industry, Parsons has brushed aside questions of gender, remarking that to acknowledge a glass ceiling would make her spend life on the floor looking up. She was given an OBE for services to the economy in 2012. An honorary fellow of the University of Newport, Parsons said the commitment from buyer esure to keep Go Compare\u2019s HQ in the area was an important factor in the sale.</p>",

In its last financial year ending 31 December 2013, Gocompare.com reported a turnover of \u00a3110m, up from \u00a3105m in 2012, with profits before tax rising to \u00a325m, from \u00a324m. Gocompare.com will continue to be based in its existing headquarters in Newport, south Wales, although Parsons will step down as chief executive. She is to be replaced by Jon Morrell, currently managing director of esure broker and esure\u2019s deputy chief operating officer. The acquisition is subject to approval by the Competition and Markets Authority. Immortalised in song Hayley Parsons\u2019 home of Newport was immortalised in song in the Alicia Keys parody as a \u201cconcrete jumble, nothing in order, not far from the border\u201d: the broader joke being any comparison between the small south Wales city and the opportunities offered by New York. Well, go compare. Parsons, 41, took eight years to turn an idea planned at her kitchen table into a \u00a3200m company based in her town \u2013 and make herself a fortune. The mother of two, born in nearby Cwmbran, left her Newport comprehensive at 16 with five GCSEs, having once hoped to have been an interior designer. Instead she joined insurance firm Admiral where she worked for the next 14 years, helping launch its own pioneering price comparison site, confused.com. In 2006, Parsons left to pursue her own vision of how to do something similar, but better. A stand-out success in a male-dominated industry, Parsons has brushed aside questions of gender, remarking that to acknowledge a glass ceiling would make her spend life on the floor looking up. She was given an OBE for services to the economy in 2012. An honorary fellow of the University of Newport, Parsons said the commitment from buyer esure to keep Go Compare\u2019s HQ in the area was an important factor in the sale.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rarely has a trade agreement invited such hyperbole and paranoia. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) \u2013 or proposed free trade pact between the US and the European Union \u2013 has triggered apocalyptic prophecies: the death of French culture; an invasion of transatlantic toxic chickens into Germany; and Britain\u2019s cherished NHS will become a stripped-down Medicare clone. From the point of view of free-trade cheerleaders, EU carmakers will more than double their sales, Europe will be seized by a jobs and growth bonanza and city halls from Chicago to Seattle will beg European firms to build their roads and schools. The world\u2019s biggest trading nations will have no choice but to play by the west\u2019s rules in the new world created by TTIP. Such are some of the claims made for TTIP which is now stoking a propaganda war on a scale never seen before in the arcane world of tariffs and non-tariff trade negotiations. \u201cIt\u2019s the most contested acronym in Europe,\u201d said Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m of Sweden, the EU trade commissioner about to take charge of the European side of the negotiations. She stepped into the fray on Sunday, her first trip to Washington since taking up her post in November. TTIP dominates her intray. Eighteen months after the launch and seven rounds of talks, everything remains up in the air. The Americans are worried. Those in Brussels running the negotiations sound crestfallen. The opposition in Europe to a transatlantic free trade area believes it has the momentum, buoyed by scare stories regularly amplified by the European media. A petition against the trade pact surpassed the 1m mark this week. It will be handed to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission chief, in Brussels on Tuesday, as a present on his 60th birthday. \u201cThere is mistrust,\u201d Matthew Barzun, the US ambassador in London, told the Guardian. A key EU official put it another way: \u201c[TTIP is] more sensitive politically in Europe than in the US.\u201d Over the past 18 months, both sides have been setting out their shopping lists. The hard talks will take place between February and July 2015 as the contours of a deal become clearer. \u201cThe real negotiations haven\u2019t really started yet,\u201d said Malmstr\u00f6m. \u201cBut the real point with TTIP is to have an ambitious agreement. There\u2019s no point just doing the low-hanging fruit.\u201d The Americans want to conclude the pact within a year while Barack Obama is still in the White House. The Europeans would also like this, but appear less stressed about the deadline. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a hurry. I\u2019m here for five years,\u201d said Malmstr\u00f6m. \u201cBut if we get the skeletons done under Obama, that will be fantastic.\u201d The easy bit, say those involved in the talks, will be the removal of tariffs and duties on goods whichonly amount to 3% of their aggregate value. Eighty percent of the perceived benefits would come from a breakthrough on non-tariff barriers, which could usher in the harmonisation of transatlantic standards and regulations on everything from food labelling and drugs-testing to the manufacture of cars or electrical components. The Europeans want access to financial services in the US, Washington is resisting. Brussels also insists on equal access to public procurement tendering and contracts in the US. And it wants to protect European foodstuffs through the protective system that decides what can be called champagne or camembert, Parma ham, or scotch whisky. \u201cGeographical indicators are very important to the EU. The US has different ideas,\u201d said Malmstr\u00f6m. \u201cThe Americans are a little bit surprised we think their foods are inferior. They don\u2019t understand why we feel so superior,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, a Dutch liberal MEP on the parliament\u2019s trade committee. In an attempt to counter what US ambassador Barzun describes as \u201cmyths\u201d and \u201cscaremongering\u201d in Europe about aspects of the proposed pact, both sides emphasise there is nothing in the talks that could facilitate the privatisation of public services such as the NHS.Audio-visual services have also been excluded to appease French fears of Hollywood and Silicon Valley decimating the French film and television industries. American hormone-fed beef, GM foods, or chlorine-washed chickens will not be allowed in Europe, the European commission maintains, for as long as they are proscribed in the EU. And yet senior commission officials admit they are fighting a losing battle against a tide of hostile and \u201cemotional\u201d public opinion that has taken them by surprise and that they are ill-equipped to counter. \u201cI need to try to understand the scepticism, the fears,\u201d said Malmstroem. Resistance is most acute in Germany, as well as in Austria and France. The European slump and currency crisis of the last five years has sapped confidence in governing elites, sown fear of globalisation, and a mistrust of the corporate world and marauding, tax-avoiding multinationals. The Snowden and NSA mass surveillance scandals have eroded faith in the Americans and strained transatlantic relations, especially in Germany, where the Americans were found to be tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s mobile phone. Around 200 questions have been tabled in the German parliament on aspects of TTIP, reflecting how MPs have been besieged by their constituents. Germany is by far Europe\u2019s biggest exporter and has most to gain from a transatlantic free trade area. EU car exports to the US, for example, could soar by 150% if a satisfactory deal is struck, say negotiators. Germany is Europe\u2019s biggest carmaker.But another reason for German ambivalence is complacency, that Berlin is happy with the way things are, that it is not worth the risk of a popular backlash. Merkel is widely seen as risk-averse, a keen student of opinion polls and not known to get too far ahead of public opinion in her policy-making. The biggest issue in the talks and the focus of the growing opposition to the pact is a touchstone for all these inchoate fears \u2013 investor protection, or the system known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), which allows companies to bypass national courts and sue governments for damages on lost investments in extra-territorial arbitration panels. For the critics, this amounts to a surrender of national political sovereignty to the deep-pocketed multinationals, with business, not government, setting the rules of international trade. This apprehension is not necessarily rational, but it is very potent. The ISDS system has existed for almost half a century, and there are 9,000 such agreements operating globally, 1,400 of them in the EU. Although Germany has practised the system since 1969, Germany remains the biggest opponent of writing ISDS in to the trade pact, perhaps because Vattenfall, the Swedish energy giant, is suing Berlin for billions in damages following Merkel\u2019s decision to abandon nuclear power. \u201cAt the end of the day there\u2019s a risk this agreement is going into troubled waters because of ISDS,\u201d said Bernd Lange, the German social democrat who chairs the European parliament\u2019s trade committee. Reflecting the German position, Juncker has said he wants no ISDS mechanism in the trade agreement. Malmstr\u00f6m is known to favour a \u201creformed\u201d version of ISDS. The EU\u2019s biggest trade pact to date \u2013 an agreement with Canada concluded in August \u2013 includes ISDS, setting a precedent for the US deal. Malmstr\u00f6m was humiliatedlast month when Juncker\u2019s staff contradicted her position and Juncker took authority for ISDS out of her remit, handing it instead to Frans Timmermans, the new commission\u2019s powerful number two. Given the widespread and growing opposition, Malmstr\u00f6m has quickly concluded that perhaps the only way to tackle the scepticism is to moderate the secrecy surrounding the negotiations and launch a new campaign of glasnost. After a year of rejecting demands, the commission has published her negotiating mandate from the EU\u2019s 28 governments. Her negotiating proposals, though not the outcome of the specific talks chapters, are now to be made public, and MEPs are to be given access to restricted documents. Lange complains that only 13 of 751 MEPs are currently allowed to see sensitive paperwork. Malmstr\u00f6m said all MEPs will soon have access. However, there will be limits to Malmstroem\u2019s transparency. \u201cIn a negotiation, you have to let the negotiators negotiate,\u201d said one senior official. Taking office this week as the new president of the European Council, chairing summits and mediating between national leaders, Donald Tusk, Poland\u2019s former prime minister, singled out TTIP as one of his main priorities for the year ahead. The Europeans argue that with the world trade agreement talks stuck, the TTIP offers a chance to break the deadlock and fasten down high standards of consumer, environmental, and legal safety that China and the emerging economies will be forced to emulate. \u201cThis is the mother of all agreements. It\u2019s a huge market and the EU needs growth desperately,\u201d said Malmstr\u00f6m. \u201cEurope\u2019s role in the world is waning. Growth will come from outside. And this will set global standards for the rest of the world.\u201d The pact will prove an uphill struggle in a jaundiced Europe fed up with its political and business elites.",

The US has different ideas,\u201d said Malmstr\u00f6m.</p> <p>\u201cThe Americans are a little bit surprised we think their foods are inferior. They don\u2019t understand why we feel so superior,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, a Dutch liberal MEP on the parliament\u2019s trade committee.</p> <p>In an attempt to counter what US ambassador Barzun describes as \u201cmyths\u201d and \u201cscaremongering\u201d in Europe about aspects of the proposed pact, both sides emphasise there is nothing in the talks that could facilitate the privatisation of public services such as the NHS.Audio-visual services have also been excluded to appease French fears of Hollywood and Silicon Valley decimating the French film and television industries. American hormone-fed beef, GM foods, or chlorine-washed chickens will not be allowed in Europe, the European commission maintains, for as long as they are proscribed in the EU.</p> <p>And yet senior commission officials admit they are fighting a losing battle against a tide of hostile and \u201cemotional\u201d public opinion that has taken them by surprise and that they are ill-equipped to counter. \u201cI need to try to understand the scepticism, the fears,\u201d said Malmstroem.</p> <p>Resistance is most acute in Germany, as well as in Austria and France. The European slump and currency crisis of the last five years has sapped confidence in governing elites, sown fear of globalisation, and a mistrust of the corporate world and marauding, tax-avoiding multinationals. The Snowden and NSA mass surveillance scandals have eroded faith in the Americans and strained transatlantic relations, especially in Germany, where the Americans were found to be tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s mobile phone. Around 200 questions have been tabled in the German parliament on aspects of TTIP, reflecting how MPs have been besieged by their constituents.</p> <p>Germany is by far Europe\u2019s biggest exporter and has most to gain from a transatlantic free trade area. EU car exports to the US, for example, could soar by 150% if a satisfactory deal is struck, say negotiators. Germany is Europe\u2019s biggest carmaker.But another reason for German ambivalence is complacency, that Berlin is happy with the way things are, that it is not worth the risk of a popular backlash. Merkel is widely seen as risk-averse, a keen student of opinion polls and not known to get too far ahead of public opinion in her policy-making.</p> <p>The biggest issue in the talks and the focus of the growing opposition to the pact is a touchstone for all these inchoate fears \u2013 investor protection, or the system known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), which allows companies to bypass national courts and sue governments for damages on lost investments in extra-territorial arbitration panels.</p> <p>For the critics, this amounts to a surrender of national political sovereignty to the deep-pocketed multinationals, with business, not government, setting the rules of international trade.</p> <p>This apprehension is not necessarily rational, but it is very potent. The ISDS system has existed for almost half a century, and there are 9,000 such agreements operating globally, 1,400 of them in the EU. Although Germany has practised the system since 1969, Germany remains the biggest opponent of writing ISDS in to the trade pact, perhaps because Vattenfall, the Swedish energy giant, is suing Berlin for billions in damages following Merkel\u2019s decision to abandon nuclear power.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day there\u2019s a risk this agreement is going into troubled waters because of ISDS,\u201d said Bernd Lange, the German social democrat who chairs the European parliament\u2019s trade committee.</p> <p>Reflecting the German position, Juncker has said he wants no ISDS mechanism in the trade agreement. Malmstr\u00f6m is known to favour a \u201creformed\u201d version of ISDS. The EU\u2019s biggest trade pact to date \u2013 an agreement with Canada concluded in August \u2013 includes ISDS, setting a precedent for the US deal.</p> <p>Malmstr\u00f6m was humiliatedlast month when Juncker\u2019s staff contradicted her position and Juncker took authority for ISDS out of her remit, handing it instead to Frans Timmermans, the new commission\u2019s powerful number two.</p> <p>Given the widespread and growing opposition, Malmstr\u00f6m has quickly concluded that perhaps the only way to tackle the scepticism is to moderate the secrecy surrounding the negotiations and launch a new campaign of glasnost.</p> <p>After a year of rejecting demands, the commission has published her negotiating mandate from the EU\u2019s 28 governments. Her negotiating proposals, though not the outcome of the specific talks chapters, are now to be made public, and MEPs are to be given access to restricted documents. Lange complains that only 13 of 751 MEPs are currently allowed to see sensitive paperwork. Malmstr\u00f6m said all MEPs will soon have access. However, there will be limits to Malmstroem\u2019s transparency. \u201cIn a negotiation, you have to let the negotiators negotiate,\u201d said one senior official.</p> <p>Taking office this week as the new president of the European Council, chairing summits and mediating between national leaders, Donald Tusk, Poland\u2019s former prime minister, singled out TTIP as one of his main priorities for the year ahead. The Europeans argue that with the world trade agreement talks stuck, the TTIP offers a chance to break the deadlock and fasten down high standards of consumer, environmental, and legal safety that China and the emerging economies will be forced to emulate.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the mother of all agreements. It\u2019s a huge market and the EU needs growth desperately,\u201d said Malmstr\u00f6m. \u201cEurope\u2019s role in the world is waning. Growth will come from outside. And this will set global standards for the rest of the world.\u201d</p> <p>The pact will prove an uphill struggle in a jaundiced Europe fed up with its political and business elites.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The growing strength of the dollar poses a threat to the stability of emerging economies, a global financial watchdog has warned. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), often described as the central bankers\u2019 bank, has warned that fragility in financial markets could have a profound impact on the global economy, especially emerging economies, such as China and India. Its warning came as China released disappointing trade figures on Monday, and the dollar rose to a seven-year high against the yen and a five-year high against the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a basket of 10 currencies. The Switzerland-based BIS also revealed that issuance of collateralised debt obligations \u2013 the controversial securities once likened to financial weapons of mass destruction \u2013 has surpassed levels recorded before the crisis. Activity in the leveraged loans market \u2013 a type of CDO \u2013 was running at $250bn (\u00a3161bn) per quarter in the year ending September 2014, compared with an average of $190bn in 2005-07. The data was in the BIS quarterly review, published on Sunday, which analysed recent episodes of stock market turbulence. The latest flash crash was on 15 October, when stock markets plunged in value and movements in US treasury bonds were more severe than the day Lehman Brothers collapsed. \u201cTo my mind these events underline the fragility \u2013 dare I say growing fragility \u2013 hidden behind the markets\u2019 buoyancy,\u201d said Claudio Borio, head of the Bank\u2019s monetary and economic department. \u201cAnd it would be imprudent to ignore that markets did not fully stabilise by themselves,\u201d he said \u2013 a reference to \u201csoothing statements\u201d from central banks that they could maintain ultra-low interest rates and bond-buying programmes aimed at boosting economic confidence. Against this backdrop, the BIS is concerned that some emerging economies could come unstuck because of a growing dependence on loans taken out in US dollars. Offshore lending in US dollars has hit $9tn, roughly double its 2008 value. Emerging economies have taken out $3.1tn in cross-border loans, mostly in US dollars. Since the end of 2012 alone, dollar loans to China have doubled to $1.1tn, and Chinese citizens have borrowed more than $360bn in debt securities. But this puts borrowing economies in a vulnerable spot. As the dollar appreciates in value against the local currency, the loan becomes more expensive to repay, raising the risk of default and economic instability. The dollar has been rising against the euro and the yen since the US Federal Reserve announced an end to its stimulus programme and hinted at an interest-rate rise next year. In contrast, the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have loosened monetary policy and signalled greater stimulus. \u201cThe appreciation of the dollar against the backdrop of divergent monetary policies may, if persistent, have a profound impact on the global economy, in particular on [emerging market economies]. For example, it may expose financial vulnerabilities as many firms in emerging markets have large US dollar-denominated liabilities,\u201d BIS said. BIS is more positive about oil prices, which have fallen by 40% since June, although it points out that some oil-exporting countries, such as Russia and Brazil, will face difficulties.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned half a million families would be at risk of falling into mortgage arrears once it started to raise interest rates from their emergency level of 0.5%. Threadneedle Street said the number of households running into difficulties would increase by a third to 480,000 in the event of a two-percentage-point increase in the cost of borrowing. The Bank stressed the proportion of borrowers having trouble paying their home loans should remain well below the levels of the early 1990s \u2013 when Britain suffered its worst postwar property crash \u2013 provided incomes rose alongside interest rates. \u201cHigher interest rates will increase financial pressure on households with high levels of debt,\u201d the Bank said in its Quarterly Bulletin. \u201cThe percentage of households with high debt-servicing ratios, who would be most at risk of financial distress, is not expected to exceed previous peaks given the likely paths of interest rates and income. \u201cBut developments in incomes for the households who are potentially most vulnerable will be an important determinant of the extent to which financial distress does increase.\u201d The findings were based on a survey for the Bank conducted by NMG consulting. It found that the average outstanding mortgage debt was \u00a383,000 per household, with average household income of \u00a333,000 a year (\u00a343,000 for those with a mortgage) and unsecured debt \u00a38,000. Interest rates have been pegged at 0.5% \u2013 the lowest in the Bank\u2019s 320-year history \u2013 since March 2009 and cheap borrowing costs have made it easier for households with large home loans to keep up payments on their mortgages. The Bank has used its forward guidance policy to stress that interest rate rises, when they come, will be gradual and limited in size. Financial markets do not anticipate the first rise to come before the second half of 2015 but the Bank is exploring the impact of tighter policy on households where more than 40% of income is spent on mortgage repayments, since these housebuyers are most likely to fall into arrears. \u201cAssuming a 10% increase in income for all households, a two-percentage-point rise in mortgage interest rates would likely raise the proportion of mortgagors with a debt service ratio (DSR) of at least 40% from its current level of 4% to about 6%. \u201cThe number of UK households in this vulnerable category would increase from about 360,000 to 480,000.But the impact would be more severe in a second, less likely, scenario where there was assumed to be no increases in incomes.\u201d Wages have been under pressure in recent years, but the Bank is assuming that the economic recovery of the past two years will create the conditions for rising incomes and higher interest rates. \u201cThese experiments illustrate that, unsurprisingly, the outlook for household income is a key factor that will determine the vulnerability of households to a rise in interest rates. There is a risk that the most vulnerable households will experience lower-than-average income growth as rates rise.\u201d The Bank said official data showed that the ratio of household debt to income had fallen back from its peak in early 2009. The debt-to-income ratio held steady at about 80% during the 1990s, rose steadily in the 2000s to peak at just over 130% and has since dropped to just over 110%. \u201cAs usual, raising interest rates will have significant distributional consequences,\u201d the article in the Quarterly Bulletin said. \u201cIt will make borrowers worse off and savers better off, holding other factors constant. On average, younger households, who are more likely to be borrowers, will be worse off, while older households, who are more likely to be savers, will gain.\u201d",
