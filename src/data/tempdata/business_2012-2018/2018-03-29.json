      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering firms is to be taken over by a company that has been labelled an asset-stripper, prompting calls for the government to block the \u00a38.1bn deal on national security grounds. GKN, which was founded in 1759 and has 59,000 staff including 6,000 in the UK, succumbed to a hostile bid from Melrose after a lengthy and sometimes acrimonious corporate tussle that has spilled over into the political arena. Melrose, which buys underperforming firms to cut costs and sell on at a profit, appealed directly to GKN shareholders after the company\u2019s board rejected two bids, narrowly winning their approval at a vote on Thursday afternoon. Investors\u2019 blessing for the takeover signals an end to the independence of a 259-year-old engineering firm that provided the iron for the construction of Britain\u2019s railways and produced Spitfires during the second world war. Business secretary Greg Clark said he would consider calls from MPs and trade unions to intervene on national security grounds, given GKN\u2019s role in making components for military aircraft including the Lockheed F-35B fighter jet. Jack Dromey, the Labour MP leader of a group of 16 politicians who wrote to Clark urging him to halt the deal, said the buyout of GKN by Melrose was a \u201cbleak day for British industry\u201d. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable called for takeover rules to be strengthened to prevent \u201cshort-term speculators\u201d snapping up shares in buyout targets in order to vote for a deal and pocket the profits. The acquisition of GKN, which began life as an ironworks near Merthyr Tydfil, is the largest hostile takeover in the UK since US firm Kraft bought Cadbury in 2010. That deal led to Cable, then business minister, calling for a \u201cCadbury law\u201d to stop hedge funds and other short-term investors influencing takeovers. Christopher Miller, the chairman of Melrose, said he was \u201cdelighted and grateful\u201d after narrowly winning the shareholder vote with 52.4% of investor support, just above the required 50.1% threshold. Melrose has consistently denied that its model of buying up businesses to sell on amounts to asset-stripping. It has made legally binding promises to keep GKN\u2019s UK headquarters and retain a British workforce, maintain research and development spending and refrain from selling its aerospace business for at least five years. \u201cLet me assure you that GKN is entering into very good hands,\u201d said Miller, a protege of Lord Hanson, the 1980s wheeler dealer who built a corporate empire with a number of aggressive takeovers. GKN\u2019s directors said on Thursday that it still believes that the deal \u201cfundamentally undervalues\u201d the company but that it now had no choice but to recommend investors sell their shares. Dromey said the government should not allow Melrose to complete the takeover. He said: \u201cToday is a bleak day for British industry. The takeover by Melrose makes a mockery of any talk by government of an industrial strategy. \u201cBritain\u2019s takeover rules are in desperate need of reform. Yet again, as in the Kraft takeover of Cadbury\u2019s, we have seen a jewel in the crown of British industry sold off because its shares were bought up by hedge funds.\u201d Dromey said the deal would not have gone through if the previous coalition government had agreed to Labour\u2019s calls to restrict investors from voting on acquisitions unless they had held shares for six months. The proposal was designed to prevent short-term speculators such as hedge funds buying up shares with the aim of influencing takeover outcomes for profit. \u201cTo let a 259-year-old British engineering icon like GKN be taken over by a short-termist asset-stripper like Melrose is a monumental failure by ministers,\u201d said Dromey. \u201cHowever, the government still has the power to intervene to block the hostile takeover takeover on defence and national security grounds. It should do so in the British national interest.\u201d Cable said: \u201cThe very narrow result \u2013 like Brexit \u2013 suggests that this takeover is not universally popular amongst shareholders. It seems it was only secured through votes from short-term speculators.\u201d Elliott Advisors, an \u201cactivist\u201d investor with a history of intervening in takeovers, built up a 3.8% stake in GKN before the deal, which it urged fellow shareholders to back a week ago. Cable called for the government to change corporate takeover rules to curb the voting power of short-term investors. He added that ministers should also be able to intervene in takeovers that might affect investment in research and development. Clark said: \u201cDuring the bid, Melrose made commitments which they are bound to honour including investment in research and development and maintaining itself as a UK business. \u201cNow that shareholders have made their decision the government has a statutory responsibility to consider whether the merger in its proposed final form gives rise to public interest concerns in the areas of media plurality, financial stability and national security. \u201cThis assessment will be made by the appropriate authorities and the conclusion set out in due course.\u201d Trade union Unite echoed Cable\u2019s concerns and said it would be \u201cholding Melrose\u2019s feet to the fire\u201d to honour its commitments to GKN but said the government should still consider blocking the deal. Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary for aerospace, Steve Turner, said: \u201cThis takeover has put into stark relief the inadequacy of the UK\u2019s takeover rules which put the interests of short-term speculators over those of the workforce and long-term investors. \u201cWe need an overhaul of UK takeover laws to strengthen the voice of stakeholders to ensure other British companies do not fall prey to corporate vultures looking to make a quick buck against the national interest.\u201d During a two-month takeover battle, Melrose repeatedly accused GKN bosses of mismanaging the company, while opponents of the deal warned that Melrose would carve up the business and prioritise short-term profits over long-term success. Melrose told the Guardian that many executives within GKN had privately expressed support for the takeover. \u201cThere have been back-channels from within GKN indicating they\u2019d welcome a new broom. We think a lot of people within GKN are really going to welcome Melrose coming in.\u201d Melrose typically rewards senior staff with large financial incentives if they succeed in cutting costs to extract maximum value out of businesses it can then sell on. The deal is the largest hostile takeover launched in the UK since Kraft swooped on Cadbury in 2009 and has attracted public scrutiny from politicians and unions, as well as investors. Earlier this month, GKN\u2019s largest customer, Airbus, said it would take its business elsewhere if the Melrose deal went ahead. Melrose first expressed interest in buying GKN in January. Subsequently GKN\u2019s management revealed plans to merge its automotive business with the US firm Dana, in an attempt to fend off the hostile approach.",

      "bodyText": "They fought the law, and the law won? At first glance, that is how Barclays\u2019 $2bn (\u00a31.4bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice may seem. The UK bank refused a deal with the DoJ 16 months ago but is now having to pay a large bill for polluting the financial system with mortgage junk \u2013 aka, residential mortgage-backed securities \u2013 between 2005 and 2007. But resistance was not futile, which is the critical point. The sums are everything. Nobody will ever confirm figures, but it was widely reported that Barclays was offered a settlement at about $5bn in 2016. If so, chief executive Jes Staley\u2019s threat to take the case to court was justified. The figure has more than halved. Why, though, settle at all? Didn\u2019t Staley argue at the time that the DoJ\u2019s case was \u201cdisconnected from the facts\u201d? Yes, he did, but you can\u2019t blame Barclays for deciding at this point that it\u2019s better to swallow some financial pain for the sake of certainty. Going the distance with the DoJ would be perilous. The reaction in Barclays\u2019 share price \u2013 it didn\u2019t budge \u2013 suggests shareholders are also happy to take a $2bn hit. The sum is roughly what they expected and it has come at a moment when Barclays can plainly afford to pay. Back in 2016, a $5bn settlement could have forced a fundraising. These days, $2bn doesn\u2019t interrupt Barclays\u2019 dividend plans. Staley deserves credit for playing the long game. There has always been a strong suspicion that DoJ has treated European banks more harshly than US counterparts when it comes to settling cases of mis-selling mortgage securities. Barclays was prepared to challenge the methodology and was right to do so. A chief executive cannot let a few billion dollars slip out of the door if he feels the sum is too harsh or the dice are loaded. Staley\u2019s standing rests entirely on the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s investigation into his attempt to unmask a whistleblower in 2016. Any adverse ruling will probably cost his job. But his handling of the DoJ case was correct. \u00a33.9bn sale of Nex Group is example of deal-making skill Is Chicago-based CME Group \u00a33.9bn purchase of Michael Spencer\u2019s electronic trading and technology outfit Nex Group \u201ca signal of tremendous support for Britain\u2019s financial services sector\u201d, as the seller declares, or another example of a US giant bagging an interesting piece of City infrastructure? Spencer\u2019s patriotic boast is probably fair. CME is the world\u2019s largest exchange and if it had serious short-term worries about London\u2019s status as the European home for trading in fixed-income securities it would not be doing this deal \u2013 or not at a price that looks juicy, certainly for Spencer, who will collect \u00a3670m for his stake. That does not imply, of course, that Brexit threats to the City have gone away. It\u2019s just that other areas of financial activity \u2013 especially fund management \u2013 look to be more directly in the firing line. And the long-term effect on the City of having EU financial regulation decided in Paris and Frankfurt remains the main story. The number of jobs being shifted immediately to the eurozone looks smaller than the scary numbers being advertised a year ago, but it\u2019s the steady drip-drip over time that matters. So, yes, it is good news for the City that CME has agreed to place its European headquarters in London. If Spencer made that a condition of the deal, well played. Beyond the Brexit lens, though, this deal is mostly an example of Spencer\u2019s deal-making skill. Back in 2016, when his former outfit Icap sold its voice broking business to Tullett Prebon for \u00a31.4bn, the part that remained was disparagingly described as the \u201crump\u201d. Spencer preferred Nex as a name and now this business is going for \u00a33.9bn, a price that would have been hard to believe two years ago. It is the UK\u2019s biggest fintech, or financial technology, company on some measures. One can bemoan its passing into US ownership, but remember that Spencer assembled Nex by buying important pieces in the US, Sweden and Israel.",

      "body": "<p>They fought the law, and the law won? At first glance, that is how Barclays\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/barclays-agrees-to-pay-2bn-to-settle-us-case-justice-department-mortgage-backed-securities\">$2bn (\u00a31.4bn) settlement</a> with the US Department of Justice may seem. The UK bank refused a deal with the DoJ 16 months ago but is now having to pay a large bill for polluting the financial system with mortgage junk \u2013 aka, residential mortgage-backed securities \u2013 between 2005 and 2007.</p> <p>But resistance was not futile, which is the critical point. The sums are everything. Nobody will ever confirm figures, but it was widely reported that Barclays was offered a settlement at about $5bn in 2016. If so, chief executive Jes Staley\u2019s threat to take the case to court was justified. The figure has more than halved.</p> <p>Why, though, settle at all? Didn\u2019t Staley argue at the time that the DoJ\u2019s case was \u201cdisconnected from the facts\u201d? Yes, he did, but you can\u2019t blame Barclays for deciding at this point that it\u2019s better to swallow some financial pain for the sake of certainty. Going the distance with the DoJ would be perilous.</p> <p>The reaction in Barclays\u2019 share price \u2013 it didn\u2019t budge \u2013 suggests shareholders are also happy to take a $2bn hit. The sum is roughly what they expected and it has come at a moment when Barclays can plainly afford to pay. Back in 2016, a $5bn settlement could have forced a fundraising. These days, $2bn doesn\u2019t interrupt Barclays\u2019 dividend plans.</p> <p>Staley deserves credit for playing the long game. There has always been a strong suspicion that DoJ has treated European banks more harshly than US counterparts when it comes to settling cases of mis-selling mortgage securities. Barclays was prepared to challenge the methodology and was right to do so. A chief executive cannot let a few billion dollars slip out of the door if he feels the sum is too harsh or the dice are loaded.</p> <p>Staley\u2019s standing rests entirely on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/10/barclays-boss-jes-staley-may-lose-bonus-over-bid-to-expose-whistleblower\">Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s investigation</a> into his attempt to unmask a whistleblower in 2016. Any adverse ruling will probably cost his job. But his handling of the DoJ case was correct.</p> <h2>\u00a33.9bn sale of Nex Group is example of deal-making skill</h2> <p>Is Chicago-based CME Group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/michael-spencer-nex-takeover-cme-group\">\u00a33.9bn purchase</a> of Michael Spencer\u2019s electronic trading and technology outfit Nex Group \u201ca signal of tremendous support for Britain\u2019s financial services sector\u201d, as the seller declares, or another example of a US giant bagging an interesting piece of City infrastructure?</p> <p>Spencer\u2019s patriotic boast is probably fair. CME is the world\u2019s largest exchange and if it had serious short-term worries about London\u2019s status as the European home for trading in fixed-income securities it would not be doing this deal \u2013 or not at a price that looks juicy, certainly for Spencer, who will collect \u00a3670m for his stake.</p> <p>That does not imply, of course, that Brexit threats to the City have gone away. It\u2019s just that other areas of financial activity \u2013 especially fund management \u2013 look to be more directly in the firing line. And the long-term effect on the City of having EU financial regulation decided in Paris and Frankfurt remains the main story. The number of jobs being shifted immediately to the eurozone looks smaller than the scary numbers being advertised a year ago, but it\u2019s the steady drip-drip over time that matters.</p> <p>So, yes, it is good news for the City that CME has agreed to place its European headquarters in London. If Spencer made that a condition of the deal, well played.</p> <p>Beyond the Brexit lens, though, this deal is mostly an example of Spencer\u2019s deal-making skill. Back in 2016, when his former outfit Icap sold its voice broking business to Tullett Prebon for \u00a31.4bn, the part that remained was disparagingly described as the \u201crump\u201d. Spencer preferred Nex as a name and now this business is going for \u00a33.9bn, a price that would have been hard to believe two years ago.</p> <p>It is the UK\u2019s biggest fintech, or financial technology, company on some measures. One can bemoan its passing into US ownership, but remember that Spencer assembled Nex by buying important pieces in the US, Sweden and Israel.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What is GKN? GKN is the UK\u2019s third largest FTSE-100 engineering company \u2013 behind BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce. It employs 59,000 staff, with 6,000 in the UK. The business traces its roots back to 1759, when it started life as an ironworks in south Wales. By 1902 it was Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds and the biggest iron, steel and coal business in the UK. It was a major armaments manufacturer during both world wars, making Spitfires and steel helmets. It later moved into the automotive and aerospace industries. It makes components for both Boeing and Airbus, while its Driveline business is used by carmakers including Ford and Jaguar Land Rover. Another business, Powder Metallurgy, makes high-tech materials for coatings. What is Melrose? A \u201cturnaround\u201d business which specialises in buying poorly performing businesses, improving them, cutting costs and selling them on. The company\u2019s motto is: \u201cBuy, Improve, Sell\u201d. It was started by three executives: Jock Miller, David Roper and Simon Peckham, two former accountants and a lawyer respectively, in 2003. In the 15 years since its flotation it has made returns of 3,000%. They have made four big acquisitions and turned Melrose from a \u00a310m company to one valued on the stock market at more than \u00a34bn. The firm has 12,000 staff and last year the three bosses, plus the finance director, shared a bonus pot of \u00a3160m. Why did Melrose bid for GKN? It is what Melrose does. But this was a big one. GKN is bigger than Melrose and its biggest deal to date. GKN\u2019s defences were low. It was a humdrum, no-fireworks firm but last autumn the share price was battered when it had to warn of lower profits after problems at its US aerospace business. The man running that business had been lined up to run the whole group. Instead, he was ousted before he even started and GKN had no boss. A former US car industry executive, Anne Stevens, was given the job when Melrose launched its \u00a37bn bid. Why the controversy? Melrose is an asset-stripper - it break firms up and sells them. It regards five years as the long-term and the top trio have huge pay deals. They have admitted they would axe jobs. The three executives could make more than \u00a3285m out of this deal. Trade unions and some MPs have been very hostile. The Tory MP Robert Halfon described Melrose as \u201crobber baron capitalism at its worst \u2013 many British jobs being destroyed by the few, corporate vultures plundering a company for short-term profits but long-term disaster\u201d. What did GKN do? The firm said it would sell its powder metallurgy business and merge its Driveline business into a US rival, giving cash and Dana shares to its investors. This is basically the Melrose strategy too \u2013 and Melrose upped its bid to \u00a38bn. Couldn\u2019t the government stop the deal? The business secretary didn\u2019t really get involved until this week, when he extracted a few limp promises from Melrose. Ministers can stop mergers for national security reasons, but they don\u2019t apply to GKN. In the same situation, other EU countries would likely take a far tougher line. Who will benefit from the deal? GKN shareholders will get 40% more than their shares were worth two months ago. They will also get to share in future gains made by Melrose. GKN\u2019s pension funds will get \u00a31bn injected into them over five years \u2013 part of the Melrose offer. City advisers, bankers, PR advisers and lawyers from both sides have racked up huge fees \u2013 probably more than \u00a3200m. Hedge funds have built stakes in the business in recent weeks, betting that Melrose would win. Stevens said of GKN\u2019s hedge fund investors: \u201cThey could not give a crap.\u201d Who won\u2019t benefit? GKN\u2019s directors and hundreds of GKN workers are expected to lose their jobs. Who said what after Melrose won? Miller: \u201cLet me assure you that GKN is entering into very good hands.\u201d Michael Heseltine on the Melrose victory: \u201cNo other country would let this happen.\u201d The Labour MP Jack Dromey: \u201cThe British national interest sold down the river. A bleak day for British industry. The takeover by Melrose makes a mockery of any talk by government of an industrial strategy.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary: \u201cMinisters got involved far too late and effectively rolled over.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On day one of Melrose\u2019s bid for GKN in January, everybody in the City knew one thing. GKN, a 259-year old company that made cannonballs for Waterloo and Spitfires in the second world war, was doomed if its management mounted a defence based on its recent financial record. GKN had disappointed its shareholders too often and three months previously had confessed to discovering a pile of overvalued stock in its US aerospace division. Credibility was low and GKN was up against a takeover specialist with a big City fanclub and a keen sense of when to pounce. As Melrose\u2019s chairman, Christopher \u201cJock\u201d Miller, volunteered, his firm had been watching GKN for years. The bidder was ready for action; the target wasn\u2019t. Miller and his two Melrose co-founders, who shared a \u00a3120m bonus pot last year from the proceeds of past deals, could wave a financial CV with an eye-catching boast: a pound invested in their company at launch in 2003 is now worth \u00a318. The firm\u2019s turnaround techniques have been condemned by the Unite union and some MPs as ugly asset-stripping \u2013 a charge Melrose fiercely rejects \u2013 but City fund managers have largely ignored that debate, as GKN knew they would. GKN, therefore, proposed its own version of a breakup \u2013 probably the only strategy that stood a chance of making the contest close. The central plank was a sale of the Driveline automotive division, which makes parts and shafts for 90% of the world\u2019s car manufacturers. GKN would instead concentrate on aerospace, the business with the best long-term prospects and a strong order book for US military work. Shareholders would collect \u00a32.5bn in cash, GKN\u2019s pension funds would get a cut of the proceeds and investors, if they wished, could hitch a ride with Dana, the US group unveiled as the new partner for Driveline. It didn\u2019t work. The takeover scrap has been a classic to rival Granada-Forte in 1995 and Kraft-Cadbury in 2009 but, as with those contests, the bidder won. Why did GKN lose? At least four reasons. First, GKN\u2019s credibility hole was deep. The \u00a3112m inventory cock-up in the US meant its chief executive-in-waiting was ousted before he\u2019d even started the job \u2013 he\u2019d been in charge of the unit. Anne Stevens, already a non-executive director of GKN and a former Ford executive, was a credible replacement and has impressed. But she was still a new face. Some GKN shareholders sold their shares before they\u2019d even heard the case for independence. Second, Melrose\u2019s investors were gung-ho for the deal. The big risk, from the bidder\u2019s point of view, was that its own investors would think a \u00a38bn reverse takeover, mostly in the form of shares, was too much to handle. Melrose gave astonishingly few details about how GKN will be managed, beyond clearing out the current board and hoping to boost profit margins, but its fans didn\u2019t mind. They probably judged \u2013 with justification \u2013 that the takeover price was good. Third, GKN\u2019s breakup strategy looked a little too panicked. The deal with Dana didn\u2019t convince everybody, however many times Stevens and GKN\u2019s chairman, Michael Turner, declared that the plan was hatched before Melrose turned up. Selling Driveline and the smaller powder metallurgy division made it harder for Stevens to rage convincingly against Melrose\u2019s \u201cshort-term capitalism\u201d. GKN itself was turning somersaults. Fourth, the political heat never reaching boiling point. The business secretary Greg Clark\u2019s intervention came late in the day \u2013 on day 54 of 57-day contest \u2013 and was weak. It merely obliged Melrose to drape itself in a union flag by promising to keep a UK head office and a listing on the London Stock Exchange, retain the GKN brands and commit to a minimum level of spending on research and development. The buyer would probably have done all those things anyway. It went one better, saying it would give ministers a veto on any sale of GKN Aerospace for five years. Why didn\u2019t the government do more? In the end, Clark seems to have decided that bending the takeover rules was a step too far. GKN is a relatively small supplier to the Ministry of Defence; only 6,000 of its 59,000 GKN employees are in the UK; and Melrose is a UK company. A formal intervention on grounds of national security is still theoretically possible but highly unlikely. One part of GKN, most likely the aerospace business, could one day re-emerge as a quoted company when Melrose turns seller. But breakup beckons.",

As Melrose\u2019s chairman, Christopher \u201cJock\u201d Miller, volunteered, his firm had been watching GKN for years. The bidder was ready for action; the target wasn\u2019t.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/gkn-shareholders-accept-melrose-takeover\">GKN shareholders accept Melrose's \u00a38bn hostile takeover</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/melrose-trio-gkn-christopher-miller-david-roper-simon-peckham\">Miller and his two Melrose co-founders</a>, who shared a \u00a3120m bonus pot last year from the proceeds of past deals, could wave a financial CV with an eye-catching boast: a pound invested in their company at launch in 2003 is now worth \u00a318. The firm\u2019s turnaround techniques have been condemned by the Unite union and some MPs as ugly asset-stripping \u2013 a charge Melrose fiercely rejects \u2013 but City fund managers have largely ignored that debate, as GKN knew they would.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"18dfc61e-83b7-42d2-a310-205549f08e0c\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>GKN is a global engineering business based in Redditch, Worcestershire. It employs nearly 60,000 people across 30 countries.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Once known as Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, the firm can trace its origins back to 1759 and the birth of the Industrial Revolution in Britain.</p>\n    <p>Split into three key divisions - GKN Aerospace, GKN Driveline and GKN Powder Metallurgy \u2013 the multinational designs, &nbsp;manufactures and services systems and components for most of the world\u2019s leading aircraft, vehicle and machinery makers.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In 2017 it recorded pre-tax profits of \u00a3572m.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>GKN, therefore, proposed its own version of a breakup \u2013 probably the only strategy that stood a chance of making the contest close. The central plank was a sale of the Driveline automotive division, which makes parts and shafts for 90% of the world\u2019s car manufacturers. GKN would instead concentrate on aerospace, the business with the best long-term prospects and a strong order book for US military work. Shareholders would collect \u00a32.5bn in cash, GKN\u2019s pension funds would get a cut of the proceeds and investors, if they wished, could hitch a ride with Dana, the US group unveiled as the new partner for Driveline.</p> \n<p>It didn\u2019t work. The takeover scrap has been a classic to rival Granada-Forte in 1995 and Kraft-Cadbury in 2009 but, as with those contests, the bidder won. Why did GKN lose? At least four reasons.</p> \n<p>First, GKN\u2019s credibility hole was deep. The \u00a3112m inventory cock-up in the US meant its chief executive-in-waiting was ousted before he\u2019d even started the job \u2013 he\u2019d been in charge of the unit. Anne Stevens, already a non-executive director of GKN and a former Ford executive, was a credible replacement and has impressed. But she was still a new face. Some GKN shareholders sold their shares before they\u2019d even heard the case for independence.</p> \n<p>Second, Melrose\u2019s investors were gung-ho for the deal. The big risk, from the bidder\u2019s point of view, was that its own investors would think a \u00a38bn reverse takeover, mostly in the form of shares, was too much to handle. Melrose gave astonishingly few details about how GKN will be managed, beyond clearing out the current board and hoping to boost profit margins, but its fans didn\u2019t mind. They probably judged \u2013 with justification \u2013 that the takeover price was good.</p> \n<p>Third, GKN\u2019s breakup strategy looked a little too panicked. The deal with Dana didn\u2019t convince everybody, however many times Stevens and GKN\u2019s chairman, Michael Turner, declared that the plan was hatched before Melrose turned up. Selling Driveline and the smaller powder metallurgy division made it harder for Stevens to rage convincingly against Melrose\u2019s \u201cshort-term capitalism\u201d. GKN itself was turning somersaults.</p> \n<p>Fourth, the political heat never reaching boiling point. The business secretary Greg Clark\u2019s intervention came late in the day \u2013 on day 54 of 57-day contest \u2013 and was weak. It merely obliged Melrose to drape itself in a union flag by promising to keep a UK head office and a listing on the London Stock Exchange, retain the GKN brands and commit to a minimum level of spending on research and development. The buyer would probably have done all those things anyway. It went one better, saying it would give ministers a veto on any sale of GKN Aerospace for five years.</p> \n<p>Why didn\u2019t the government do more? In the end, Clark seems to have decided that bending the takeover rules was a step too far. GKN is a relatively small supplier to the Ministry of Defence; only 6,000 of its 59,000 GKN employees are in the UK; and Melrose is a UK company. A formal intervention on grounds of national security is still theoretically possible but highly unlikely. One part of GKN, most likely the aerospace business, could one day re-emerge as a quoted company when Melrose turns seller. But breakup beckons.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The three men who built Melrose into a \u00a34.3bn business have a long track record of buying struggling industrial companies, turning them round and selling them on at a profit. Christopher \u201cJock\u201d Miller, Melrose\u2019s executive chairman, was a protege of Lord Hanson, the 1980s wheeler dealer who built a corporate empire with a number of aggressive takeovers. Miller and David Roper met while working as chartered accountants in Switzerland in the 1970s. Miller then joined Hanson, while Roper went to work in the corporate finance divisions of banks SG Warburg, BZW and Dillon Read. Roper was nicknamed \u201cthe Grinder\u201d, supposedly for his detailed financial analysis of companies targeted for takeover. Together they bought into small Leicestershire shoe retailer Wassall in 1988. Using Wassall as an acquisition vehicle, the duo turned it from a company worth just \u00a31.9m into a wide-ranging engineering business, from glue to bottle tops. The shoe shops were sold and a series of ever larger takeovers followed. Eventually Wassall was itself sold to the US buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for \u00a3672m in 2000. Simon Peckham, a solicitor, joined Wassall in 1990 and later became its corporate development director. He started his career as a solicitor at Clifford Chance and later worked for the equity finance division of Royal Bank of Scotland between 2000 and 2003. After spending a couple of years doing little but improving their golf handicaps, according to Roper, he and Miller teamed up with Peckham again to set up Melrose. They put in \u00a33m of their own money and floated the company on London\u2019s junior Aim market in 2003 with a market capitalisation of \u00a310m. Melrose gained backing from a number of top City institutions including Schroders and Fidelity. Once again they used the company to mount a series of acquisitions \u2013 the die-cast specialist Dynacast, the engineering group McKechnie and the metering business Elster among them \u2013 before disposing of them and returning the proceeds to shareholders. Melrose\u2019s current businesses are Nortek, a US company that makes kitchen stove hoods and extractor fans, and Brush, which produces electricity generating equipment. Melrose has an annual turnover of just over \u00a31bn and employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. It has a market value of \u00a34.3bn. Miller, Roper and Peckham, along with Melrose finance director Geoff Martin, hit the headlines last year when it emerged that they would share a bonus pot of \u00a3160m, one of the biggest corporate paydays in the City. Peckham has been chief executive of Melrose since 2012, taking over from Roper who was appointed executive vice-chairman at that time. Setting out their philosophy, Roper once said: \u201cWe find fundamentally good businesses which are badly managed but need a change of culture.\u201d A takeover of GKN would be their biggest deal yet, and their biggest challenge. Miller has always been philosophical about failures along the way. He told the Daily Telegraph in 2004 after losing the battle for mini-conglomerate Novar: \u201cIf you fail in a public company bid, everyone knows and of course it is disappointing. My children said: \u2018Oh Daddy, can\u2019t you just pay them more?\u2019 This is about getting an asset at the right price. If you can\u2019t get the right price, you just go home.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Windfarms and solar panels produced more electricity than the UK\u2019s eight nuclear power stations for the first time at the end of last year, official figures show. Britain\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions also continued to fall, dropping 3% in 2017, as coal use fell and the use of renewables climbed. Energy experienced the biggest drop in emissions of any UK sector, of 8%, while pollution from transport and businesses stayed flat. Energy industry chiefs said the figures showed that the government should rethink its ban on onshore wind subsidies, a move that ministers have hinted could happen soon. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of the big six lobby group Energy UK, said: \u201cWe need to keep up the pace ... by ensuring that the lowest cost renewables are no longer excluded from the market.\u201d Across the whole year, low-carbon sources of power \u2013 wind, solar, biomass and nuclear \u2013 provided a record 50.4% of electricity, up from 45.7% in 2016. But in the fourth quarter of 2017, high wind speeds, new renewables installations and lower nuclear output saw wind and solar becoming the second biggest source of power for the first time. Wind and solar generated 18.33 terawatt hours (TWh), with nuclear on 16.69TWh, the figures published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy show. But renewables still have a long way to go to catch up with gas, the UK\u2019s top source of electricity at 36.12TWh, which saw its share of generation fall slightly. Greenpeace said the figures showed the government should capitalise on its lead in renewables and \u201cstop wasting time and money propping up nuclear power\u201d. Horizon Nuclear Power, a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, is in talks with Whitehall officials for a financial support package from the government, which it says it needs by midsummer. By contrast, large-scale solar and onshore wind projects are not eligible for support, after the Conservative government cut subsidies in 2015. However the energy minister, Claire Perry, recently told House Magazine that \u201cwe will have another auction that brings forward wind and solar, we just haven\u2019t yet said when\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the day, here is a summary of the main developments: We are still awaiting the outcome of the battle for GKN. Will the engineering giant win its fight to retain independence, or will shareholders back Melrose\u2019s \u00a38bn hostile takeover approach. The decision is due by 5pm and we will have the latest updates here. After a roller-coaster week for markets, shares are up today on both sides of the Atlantic. The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% or 19 points at 7,064. There was some bad news from the UK retail sector, as the owner of Bargain Booze and Wine Rack - Conviviality - said it would appoint administrators within a fortnight after failing to secure emergency funds. UK house prices fell for a second month in March according to Nationwide, by 0.2%, as cash-strapped consumers proved unwilling to make major spending commitments. London continues to lag the rest of the country. The ONS confirmed the UK economy grew by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and revised up annual growth in 2017 to 1.8% from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. A breakdown of the GDP report showed that household spending growth of 1.7% in 2017 was the weakest in six years, as falling real pay took its toll on family finances. In the US, initial jobless claims dropped to a 45-year low of 215,000 last week, in a further show of strength for America\u2019s labor market. The US Department of Justice announced that Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn to settle claims that it fraudulently sold residential mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Tuesday. US markets after the opening bell: Dow Jones: +0.5% at 23,974 S&amp;P 500: +0.5% at 2,617 Nasdaq: +0.5% at 23,974 Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn to settle claims that it fraudulently sold residential mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Announcing the levy, the US Department of Justice said Barclays had caused billions of dollars in losses to investors by engaging in a fraudulent scheme to sell 36 residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) deals between 2005 and 2007, misleading investors about the quality of the mortgage loans backing those deals. Richard Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said: This settlement reflects the ongoing commitment of the Department of Justice, and this Office, to hold banks and other entities and individuals accountable for their fraudulent conduct. The substantial penalty Barclays and its executives have agreed to pay is an important step in recognizing the harm that was caused to the national economy and to investors in RMBS. As well as the fine imposed on the bank, two former Barclays executives have agreed to pay a combined sum of $2m in exchange for a dismissal of claims brought against them individually. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in 45 years last week. Initial claims fell 12,000 to 215,000 in the week ending 24 March, the lowest since January 1973, the US Labor Department said. It followed 227,000 claims a week earlier, and was well below the 230,000 claims forecast by economists. Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold - considered a measure of a strong labour market - for 158 consecutive weeks. That is the longest run of growth since 1970. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says he is concerned by this morning\u2019s ONS figures, which showed the savings ratio hit a record low of 4.9% in 2017. He says: These are deeply worrying figures. The fact that for the first time in 30 years households are now net borrowers, taking on more debt and seeing their incomes squeezed by inflation, while the savings ratio is at its lowest level since records began, should be setting off alarm bells in the Treasury. The chancellor stubbornly refused to use the spring statement to help working families, but he must now reconsider his policy of inaction as households are clearly reeling from the effects of eight years of Tory economic failure \u2013 with real wages still lower than when the Conservatives first came to power in 2010. The next Labour government will end austerity, introduce a \u00a310 per hour real living wage and cap interest on credit cards, to build a high wage, high skill economy of the future. President Trump has made very clear his feelings about Amazon in his first tweet of the day: Time for a European market update: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,061 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.8% at 12,037 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 5,161 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 22,386 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.7% at 9,620 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 371 US stock index futures are up with tech shares posting slim gains after being hammered earlier in the week. Shares in the so-called FANG group - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) - were up between 0.6% and 1.6% in pre-market trading. This morning\u2019s GDP report from the ONS showed that household spending grew by 1.7% in 2017 - the weakest since 2011. It reflects the tough backdrop faced by consumers since the Brexit vote in 2016, which drove a sharp fall in the value of the pound and pushed up the price of goods imported from abroad. As those price rises fed through to higher inflation, wage growth failed to keep pace, signalling falling real pay for workers. Households have responded to tighter budgets by spending less on non-essential items and becoming reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, explains: The detail today laid bare the squeeze on the household cash position sitting behind this subdued spending backdrop. Real household disposable income rose by just 0.1% over the quarter, a softening from the already subdued 0.3% increase in Q3. Wages and salaries were a positive influence to incomes growth but their influence was almost completely offset by the impact of rising inflation. Following a run of soft outturns, real household incomes grew by just 0.3% in 2017 as a whole. However, Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics say there is light at the end of the tunnel for UK consumers as inflation has already started to fall. With a sustained rises in real wages on the horizon, the outlook for spending growth remains bright. This supports our view that the economy will grow by around 2% this year, above the consensus estimate of 1.5%. Shares in Renault rose more than 5% after Bloomberg reported the French car maker is in talks to merge with Japanese car giant Nissan. Bloomberg says: Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co. are in talks to merge, seeking to solidify their two-decade-old alliance under a single stock as an unprecedented shift toward electric and shared cars transforms the industry, people with knowledge of the matter said. A deal would end the current alliance between the companies and marry them as one corporation, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the details aren\u2019t public. Renault currently owns 43 percent of Nissan while the Japanese carmaker has a 15 percent stake in its French counterpart. Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of both companies, is driving the negotiations and would run the combined entity, the people said. A merged giant would be a more formidable rival for Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp., allowing the partners to better pool resources as the industry shifts toward new-energy vehicles, autonomous driving and car-sharing services. While the alliance of Renault and Nissan has brought savings, the fragmented ownership structure has prevented the companies from reaping full benefits from their union. How the pound has fared against the dollar since the EU referendum: The pound is on course for its best quarterly performance against the dollar since 2015, despite dipping this morning. After taking a hammering in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in June 2016, the pound is currently up 4% against the dollar over the first quarter as it draws to a close. That\u2019s the biggest quarterly rise since mid 2015. Against the euro, the pound has risen 1.4% since January, which would be the best performance since 2016. Growing expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates faster than expected over the coming months has boosted the pound. Developments in Brexit negotiations that have been interpreted as broadly positive have also helped the UK currency. Current trading: The pound is roughly flat against the dollar at $1.4066 It is down 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1420 CME agrees \u00a33.9bn deal for Michael Spencer\u2019s Nex Group The world\u2019s largest futures exchange, CME Group, has agreed to buy Michael Spencer\u2019s Nex Group in a \u00a33.9bn deal that will net the former Tory party treasurer \u00a3670m. CME also picked London as its European headquarters, giving a much-needed boost to the UK government during its Brexit negotiations. The move comes after CME\u2019s decision last year to shut its loss-making London bourse and clearing house. Spencer, chief executive of Nex, owns a 17.6% stake in the financial broker he founded in 1986. It changed its name from Icap at the end of 2016 and is one of the world\u2019s biggest money-broking firms. Spencer will join the CME board as a special advisor and will stay on for a minimum of two years to oversee the integration of the two businesses. The takeover, which still has to be approved by Nex shareholders, will lead to 750 job losses over the next three years in the combined business, or 16% of the total workforce. It is not clear where they will occur. Nex has 1,900 employees globally, including 634 in London and 42 in Bristol. CME employs 2,800 people worldwide, 400 of them in London. Last year Nex agreed to pay back donations of \u00a325,000 made to Conservative general election candidates following a shareholder revolt. Britain\u2019s services sector continued to be the main driver of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, despite being revised down. It accounts for about three quarters of the UK economy. Output in the sector increased by 0.4%, lower than the 0.6% growth estimated previously. Transport, storage and communications services grew by 1.1%, while output at hotels and restaurants fell 0.1%. Here are how some of the other major parts of the economy performed between October and December: Industrial production grew by 0.4% Manufacturing output rose 1.3% Construction output fell 0.1% Agriculture contracted by 1% Household spending grew by 0.3% Government spending increased by 0.4% The trade deficit widened to \u00a39.34bn from \u00a37.6bn in Q3 Business investment increased by 0.3% The ONS has revised its estimate for annual growth in 2017 back up to 1.8%. That\u2019s in line with its first estimate, before the ONS revised it down to 1.7% in its first revision. It is still the weakest growth in five years. Consumer spending grew, but at a weaker rate than previous years as the fall in real wages took its toll: The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the final three months of 2017, the Office for National Statistics confirmed in its latest estimate of GDP. It was unchanged from previous estimates. Rob Kent-Smith, a statistician at the ONS, gives a handy overview: Economic growth at the end of last year was unrevised with services and manufacturing continuing to drive growth. Household borrowing increased throughout 2017, while their saving was the lowest on record. However, the UK\u2019s deficit with the rest of the world shrank, as the UK received increased earnings on foreign investments thanks to a growing world economy. The service sector picked up in the three months to January with architecture, leasing companies and health work all boosting growth. Brian Murphy, head of lending for the Mortgage Advice Bureau, has commented on the 0.2% fall in UK house prices reported by Nationwide: Given that some areas of the country, such as Northern Ireland and Wales, are seeing more significant increases in prices, while London is still seeing prices cool, suggests that the [headline figure] masks a broad degree of variance across the regions, which rather underscores the effect that dipping London and South East values are having on the wider average. That there is still such a marked North-South divide in average house properties values is, of course, no surprise. However, market conditions in London and thew South East market would appear to be somewhat lacklustre when compared to other areas, proving that consumer confidence is still very strong outside the capital and its commuter belt, as underscored by the ongoing paucity of stock in these areas. Germany\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 5.3% in March from 5.4% in February. That\u2019s the lowest rate since German reunification in 1990. The total number of unemployed people fell more than expected by 19,000 to 2.37 million. The positive backdrop for employment is likely to further boost consumer confidence in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Nationwide has published its latest monthly house price index which shows the average price fell 0.2% in March, to \u00a3211,625. It followed a 0.4% fall in March, and took the annual rate of house price growth to 2.1%. The last time the annual rate was weaker was June 2013. Here is how the picture looks regionally, where London is lagging behind the rest of the country: Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, gives his view of the market: On the surface, the relatively subdued pace of house price growth appears at odds with recent healthy rates of employment growth, a modest pick-up in wage growth and historically low borrowing costs. However, consumer confidence has remained subdued, due to the ongoing squeeze on household finances as wage growth continues to lag behind increases in the cost of living. Looking ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. Subdued economic activity and the ongoing squeeze on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year. Nationwide is predicting house price growth of just 1% in 2018 overall. Here is our full story on Conviviality, which this morning said it would file for administration within a fortnight: The number of cars rolling off UK production lines fell again in February after a 17% drop in demand from the home market. A total of 145,475 cars were made in British factories last month, down 4.4% on a year earlier. Cars built for export, which account for about 80% of UK production, dipped 0.8%. Mike Hawes, chief executive, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders which produces the figures, said the figures were concerning: Another month of double digit decline in production for the UK is of considerable concern, but we hope that the degree of certainty provided by last week\u2019s Brexit transition agreement will help stimulate business and consumer confidence over the coming months. These figures also highlight the scale of our sector\u2019s dependency on exports, so a final deal that keeps our frictionless trade links with our biggest market, the EU, after December 2020 is now a pressing priority. Conviviality, the firm behind Bargain Booze and Wine Rack has announced this morning that it will appoint administrators within a fortnight, putting 2,600 jobs at risk. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association has warned some pubs could face shortage of some drinks in the short-term, because the company\u2019s Matthew Clark and Bibendum subsidiaries are major suppliers. After failing to secure emergency funding from investors, Conviviality a brief statement: Following discussions with its lending banks, the board has resolved to file notice of intention to appoint administrators to the Company. Unless circumstances change, and in accordance with statutory requirements, the board intend to appoint administrators within 10 business days. The secured creditors can, however, appoint administrators without the requirement for notice. The directors intend to allow the business to continue to trade and the company continues to work alongside advisers in order to preserve as much value as possible for all stakeholders as it explores a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business. Further announcements will be made as appropriate. Here is the background: And we\u2019re off. Here are the opening scores across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.1% Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The one-year countdown to Brexit has begun. Concerns that the UK economy would suffer an immediate slump following the vote to leave the EU proved unfounded, and GDP has continued to grow, albeit at a modest pace. However, Britain is now lagging behind peers in the G7 and major eurozone economies, as the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and strained household finances weigh on activity. Figures to be published by the Office for National Statistics at 9.30am are expected to show the UK economy grew by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, unchanged from earlier estimates and following growth of 0.5% in the third quarter.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "ExxonMobil worked with a company connected to a senior Conservative party figure to transfer an oil asset in Liberia despite \u201cconcern over issues regarding US anti-corruption laws\u201d, the Guardian can reveal. Documents seen by the Guardian show that ExxonMobil proposed a complex financial arrangement to move the rights to a Liberian oil block through two financial transactions on the same day, after concerns were raised about the original allocation of the rights. Under the arrangement, a company called Peppercoast sold rights in a west African oil block to a company called Canadian Overseas Petroleum Limited (COPL). Viscount Astor, the father-in-law of David Cameron, the former prime minister, is a director of COPL, which is registered in Bermuda. COPL then immediately sold the majority of the asset to ExxonMobil. The Liberian rights had originally been assigned to a company called Broadway Consolidated before transferring to Peppercoast in 2010. According to documents seen by the Guardian, Broadway Consolidated\u2019s shareholders included a lawyer linked to a senior Liberian official who was involved in allocating the asset. A report, by Liberia\u2019s auditor general, said the original process of handing the assets to Broadway was \u201ccompromised by bribery and influence peddling\u201d. A spokesman for COPL said the company had fully investigated the findings in the auditor general\u2019s report, and found there were no irregularities. It said it had insisted on a fully transparent process for the deal, which required approval by a vote of both the Liberian congress and senate, as well as the approval of multiple Liberian ministries. The Guardian has seen a document that states that \u201cdue to ExxonMobil concern\u201d, two contracts were to be created and the asset moved from Peppercoast to COPL and on to the US oil company within less than 24 hours in April 2013. Global Witness is publishing a report on the deal on Thursday. Jonathan Gant, senior campaigner at Global Witness, said: \u201cExxon and COPL structured a complex deal to buy their oil licence, although as our report published today shows, the block they bought had questionable origins.\u201d ExxonMobil paid about $120m (\u00a385m) for the asset, Block 13. COPL retained about 17% of the asset as a result of the deal. As part of the deal, which was signed off in London, Peppercoast agreed to \u201cundertake action to limit payment to certain shareholders to cash\u201d. ExxonMobil and COPL also requested that Liberia agree that \u201cpast irregularities will not affect [the contract] or its new owners\u201d. A spokesman for COPL said: \u201c[COPL] and Exxon Mobil carried out their own due diligence exercise and found no evidence to support the allegations and found credible evidence that the allegations of impropriety were entirely false.\u201d An Exxon spokesperson said: \u201cExxonMobil has an unwavering commitment to honest and ethical behaviour wherever we do business. We have a long-standing commitment to compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-bribery laws of the countries and territories in which we do business. \u201cExxonMobil complies with all applicable laws and regulations. The process of this transaction was transparent, and the terms of the production sharing contract are publicly available.\u201d ExxonMobil is based in Texas and has revenues of more than $200bn a year. Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon, was fired from his role as US secretary of state by Donald Trump earlier in March. Concerns were raised over the ExxonMobil deal by campaigners in Liberia in the run-up to 2013, because Block 13 was believed to be one of the country\u2019s most valuable natural assets and the original allocation had been controversial. Before the deal went through, Lord Flight, a Conservative peer and a shareholder in Peppercoast, wrote to Henry Bellingham, who was then a Foreign Office minister. Bellingham and Flight were both Conservative MPs together for several years. In May 2011, Flight wrote to Bellingham asking him to monitor attempts by Liberians to block the sale of the asset, saying that he was \u201ca modest shareholder in the company along with other British shareholders\u201d. \u201cPeppercoast is not seeking any specific help [but] wishes to advise NOCAL [the National Oil Company of Liberia] that the FCO [Foreign Office] is aware of Peppercoast Petroleum\u2019s situation.\u201d Liberia has received billions of dollars in aid from the international community, including the UK since the civil war that ended in 2003. The friendly email concludes: \u201cAs you will assume, there is substantially more material on this matter which I have emailed to you separately.\u201d The Foreign Office has refused to publish this information. A month after Flight\u2019s email, in the grand surroundings of London\u2019s Draper\u2019s Hall, Bellingham introduced Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, then the Liberian president, to Peppercoast representatives. Bellingham said: \u201cI do indeed recall attending the UK/Liberia Investment Forum at Drapers\u2019 Hall in my capacity as the minister for Africa. The idea behind this Investment Forum was to boost UK/Liberia trade, and I attended the event along with a number of Foreign Office officials and members of UKTI.\u201d Flight said: \u201cI was aware, as a modest shareholder in the company, that Peppercoast Petroleum was experiencing problems with the National Oil Company of Liberia and my email to Henry Bellingham duly advised him that I was a modest shareholder in Peppercoast, along with other British shareholders. \u201cMy email to Henry Bellingham specifically did not request any assistance from the FCO but made it clear that it was to advise the FCO of Peppercoast\u2019s situation.\u201d David Cameron travelled to Liberia in February 2013, meeting both the then president and Robert Sirleaf, her son , who was then the chairman of NOCAL, which oversaw the transfer of the asset to Exxon. A major interest in Peppercoast was held by RAB Capital, a London-based hedge fund. RAB Capital is a major Conservative donor, as are both founders, Michael Alen-Buckley and Philip Richards. They were both members of the Leader\u2019s Group, which requires a minimum donation of \u00a350,000 a year to the party. Viscount Astor, who is married to Samantha Cameron\u2019s mother, became a consultant for COPL, and then a director. Several Conservative donors had shares in Peppercoast.",

COPL retained about 17% of the asset as a result of the deal. </p> <p>As part of the deal, which was signed off in London, Peppercoast agreed to \u201cundertake action to limit payment to certain shareholders to cash\u201d. </p> <p>ExxonMobil and COPL also requested that Liberia agree that \u201cpast irregularities will not affect [the contract] or its new owners\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesman for COPL said: \u201c[COPL] and Exxon Mobil carried out their own due diligence exercise and found no evidence to support the allegations and found credible evidence that the allegations of impropriety were entirely false.\u201d</p> <p>An Exxon spokesperson said: \u201cExxonMobil has an unwavering commitment to honest and ethical behaviour wherever we do business. We have a long-standing commitment to compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-bribery laws of the countries and territories in which we do business. </p> <p>\u201cExxonMobil complies with all applicable laws and regulations. The process of this transaction was transparent, and the terms of the production sharing contract are publicly available.\u201d</p> <p>ExxonMobil is based in Texas and has revenues of more than $200bn a year. Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/rex-tillerson-fired-what-happened-trump-secretary-state\">was fired from his role</a> as US secretary of state by Donald Trump earlier in March.</p> <p>Concerns were raised over the ExxonMobil deal by campaigners in Liberia in the run-up to 2013, because Block 13 was believed to be one of the country\u2019s most valuable natural assets and the original allocation had been controversial. </p> <p>Before the deal went through, Lord Flight, a Conservative peer and a shareholder in Peppercoast, wrote to Henry Bellingham, who was then a Foreign Office minister.</p> <p>Bellingham and Flight were both Conservative MPs together for several years. </p> <p>In May 2011, Flight wrote to Bellingham asking him to monitor attempts by Liberians to block the sale of the asset, saying that he was \u201ca modest shareholder in the company along with other British shareholders\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeppercoast is not seeking any specific help [but] wishes to advise NOCAL [the National Oil Company of Liberia] that the FCO [Foreign Office] is aware of Peppercoast Petroleum\u2019s situation.\u201d</p> <p>Liberia has received billions of dollars in aid from the international community, including the UK since the civil war that ended in 2003. </p> <p>The friendly email concludes: \u201cAs you will assume, there is substantially more material on this matter which I have emailed to you separately.\u201d<br> The Foreign Office has refused to publish this information.</p> <p>A month after Flight\u2019s email, in the grand surroundings of London\u2019s Draper\u2019s Hall, Bellingham introduced Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, then the Liberian president, to Peppercoast representatives.</p> <p>Bellingham said: \u201cI do indeed recall attending the UK/Liberia Investment Forum at Drapers\u2019 Hall in my capacity as the minister for Africa. The idea behind this Investment Forum was to boost UK/Liberia trade, and I attended the event along with a number of Foreign Office officials and members of UKTI.\u201d</p> <p>Flight said: \u201cI was aware, as a modest shareholder in the company, that Peppercoast Petroleum was experiencing problems with the National Oil Company of Liberia and my email to Henry Bellingham duly advised him that I was a modest shareholder in Peppercoast, along with other British shareholders. </p> <p>\u201cMy email to Henry Bellingham specifically did not request any assistance from the FCO but made it clear that it was to advise the FCO of Peppercoast\u2019s situation.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/01/david-cameron-liberia-poverty-talks\">David Cameron travelled to Liberia in February 2013</a>, meeting both the then president and Robert Sirleaf, her son , who was then the chairman of NOCAL, which oversaw the transfer of the asset to Exxon.</p> <p>A major interest in Peppercoast was held by RAB Capital, a London-based hedge fund. RAB Capital is a major Conservative donor, as are both founders, Michael Alen-Buckley and Philip Richards. They were both members of the Leader\u2019s Group, which requires a minimum donation of \u00a350,000 a year to the party.</p> <p>Viscount Astor, who is married to Samantha Cameron\u2019s mother, became a consultant for COPL, and then a director. Several Conservative donors had shares in Peppercoast. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The pay of BP\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley, jumped by almost 13% last year to $13.4m (\u00a39.5m), bringing it closer to the $19.4m pay package shareholders rejected two years ago. In 2016, the oil company\u2019s investors staged a revolt over a 20% pay rise for 2015 after BP posted its worst ever loss. Dudley\u2019s pay was cut to $11.9m in 2016. But the company more than doubled its profits to $6.2bn in 2017 off the back of resurgent oil prices and increased production. While that performance was largely a result of major oil-producing countries curbing production to prop up prices, it means shareholders are less likely to rebel against the pay rise atthe annual general meeting in May. BP defended the double-digit pay increase for Dudley in its annual report, which was published on Thursday. \u201cThe [remuneration] committee believes that these outcomes appropriately reflect the strong operational and financial performance of BP this year and over the past three years whilst demonstrating a commitment to a considered approach,\u201d the report said. The committee said Dudley\u2019s pay for 2017 would have been even higher, at $17.6m, but it had used its discretion to reduce it to $13.4m. The US executive, who has led BP since 2010, was paid a salary of $1.854m, with the bulk of his pay made up of $7.787m of performance shares. He also received $73,000 in benefits, a pension worth $746,000, a cash bonus of $1.491m and deferred shares worth $1.491m. Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP\u2019s chairman, said: \u201c2017 was a year which saw delivery and growth across all our businesses. This was an impressive performance from Bob Dudley and his great team, now fully into their stride.\u201d The company\u2019s share price was up 1.6% on Thursday morning.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays\u2019 online and mobile banking services will be unavailable this weekend, as the bank temporarily switches off access for 24 million customers to meet regulations designed to avoid taxpayer bailouts. Throughout the night from 11.30pm on Saturday until 3.30pm the following afternoon on Easter Sunday, customers will be unable to check their balances using the internet or their mobile phones, make any payments online, or transfer money using the bank\u2019s mobile Pingit app. Customers will still be able to use their debit and credit cards to shop on the high street or buy goods from online retailers despite the big switch-off, and cash machines will also continue to work. The changes come as part of the Bank of England\u2019s ringfencing rules, introduced in 2011 but allowing banks until the start of 2019 to make changes, which force banks to split their riskier \u201ccasino\u201d investment arms from their more straightforward retail and small business banking activities. Having already prepared for about three years to switch the bank off and back on again, Barclays will use the shutdown to reorganise its IT network so that 24m accounts can move to sit within its new ringfenced bank. It will be the seventh and final time the bank has closed down its systems, having started by reallocating some customers\u2019 sort codes from the middle of last summer. Barclays is not alone in making the changes, with HSBC, Lloyds, RBS and Santander UK also taking steps to split themselves in two, although its work is considered more complex because it has a bigger investment bank than many of its rivals. Threadneedle Street estimates almost 1 million UK bank customers will have to use new six-digit sort codes as the high street lenders implement the rules, which are intended to make the financial system safer. Different banks are taking different approaches to meeting the rules. RBS, which remains majority-owned by the government a decade after the financial crisis, chose to rename its investment bank as NatWest Markets as part of the ringfencing changes, attempting to move away from its troubled past. HSBC is relocating the headquarters of its ringfenced bank to Birmingham, moving 1,000 jobs from its London base in Canary Wharf, while Lloyds and Santander UK are making fewer changes because they have relatively small investment banks. Sir Ian Cheshire, the former boss of Kingfisher, which owns B&amp;Q, will be the chairman of Barclays\u2019 ringfenced bank, with other members on the board drawn to ensure its independence from the wider Barclays bank including Sir John Timpson, chairman of the family-owned shoe-repair and key-cutting chain, and Michael Jary, chairman of the organic food range Duchy Originals. Having planned for months and employed thousands of workers on the project to meet the ringfencing rules, Barclays is making the changes over the long Easter weekend because it will give the bank as much time as possible before its branches open again on Tuesday morning. About 1,500 staff will work on the changeover, most of them based at the bank\u2019s technology centre at Radbroke Hall \u2013 an old luxury home in the style of a French chateau nestled deep in the Cheshire countryside, where the bank bases its global technology centre. Barclays has been sending customers messages about the shutdown, apologising in advance that they would not be able to manage their accounts online, by phone or in the app. Payments made into customers\u2019 accounts will be added as soon as the work is finished, the messages said, while it advised them to move money between their accounts now before the work begins and said live updates would be available on the internet and on Twitter.",

The move comes after CME\u2019s decision last year to shut its loss-making London bourse and clearing house. \u201cCME\u2019s decision to choose London as its European headquarters is also a signal of tremendous support for Britain\u2019s financial services sector,\u201d Spencer said. Spencer, the Nex chief executive, owns a 17.6% stake in the financial broker he founded in 1986. It changed its name from Icap at the end of 2016 and is one of the world\u2019s biggest money-broking firms. He will join the CME board as a special adviser and will stay on for a minimum of two years to oversee the integration of the two businesses. It is the biggest overseas acquisition made by the Chicago-based CME, and its largest in a decade. CME said it would pay \u00a310 a share for Nex \u2013 \u00a35 in cash and 0.00444 new CME shares per Nex share. Nex said it would recommend the deal to shareholders. Investors will also receive a final dividend for the year to March 2018, which will not exceed 7.65p a share. The takeover, which still has to be approved by Nex shareholders, will lead to 750 job losses over the next three years in the combined business, or 16% of the total workforce. It is not clear where they will occur. Nex has 1,900 employees globally, including 634 in London and 42 in Bristol. CME employs 2,800 people worldwide, 400 of them in London. Last year Nex agreed to pay back donations of \u00a325,000 made to Conservative general election candidates after a shareholder revolt.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK house prices fell in March for the second month in a row, with London again the weakest region, according to Nationwide, one of Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders. The average price of a home was \u00a3211,625 last month, down 0.2% from the previous month. In February, values fell 0.4%. The annual rate of growth in March slowed to 2.1% from 2.2%, marking the joint lowest rate since June 2013. Robert Gardner, the Nationwide chief economist, pointed to the continued squeeze on incomes, despite a modest pickup in wage growth. \u201cConsumer confidence has remained subdued, due to the ongoing squeeze on household finances as wage growth continues to lag behind increases in the cost of living,\u201d he said. Northern Ireland led house price growth in the first quarter with a 7.9% annual increase, although prices there are still the furthest below their pre-crisis levels \u2013 38% below 2007 \u2013 while overall UK prices are 16% above. Wales also saw house price growth pickup, from 3.3% to a 6.1% annual rate, while Scotland was little changed. The West Midlands, the region with the strongest growth last year, was the fastest-growing among the English regions, with prices up 4.9% year-on-year. For the fourth quarter in a row, areas in the north of England recorded stronger annual house price growth than those in the south, where rates are now the slowest since 2012. In London prices were down 1% compared with a year ago. As a result, the north-south divide has narrowed slightly, although values in the north of England are on average still less than half of those in the south. A typical house in the north costs \u00a3163,138, compared with \u00a3331,047 in the south. Gardner said: \u201cLooking ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. Subdued economic activity and the ongoing squeeze on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year.\u201d Nationwide expects house prices to rise about 1% this year, with unemployment and mortgage interest rates still low, along with the lack of properties on the market, likely to provide some support for house prices. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, reckons prices will flatline this year, strengthening the case for just one Bank of England rate rise in 2018. He said Nationwide\u2019s figures provided \u201cmore evidence that even the relatively modest increase in mortgage rates seen over the last six months has hit the market hard\u201d. Tombs also said record high loan-to-income ratios meant that homebuyers will have to put a much larger share of their incomes towards loan payments.",

The impending administration has prompted warnings that beer pumps could run dry. More than 20,000 of Britain\u2019s pubs are supplied by the company\u2019s Matthew Clark division. The trade body, the British Beer and Pub Association, said many could now face short-term supply issues. Conviviality said after discussions with its banks, the board had decided to appoint administrators within 10 business days, unless circumstances change. The secured creditors can also appoint administrators without filing notice. The news came a day after the company said investors had refused its request for a fresh cash injection of \u00a3125m, needed to stave off bankruptcy after a string of profit warnings. The first warning was related to Conviviality\u2019s failure to budget for a \u00a330m tax bill. Its chief executive, Diana Hunter, has stepped down. Directors are still looking for a buyer for all or part of the business, and it will continue to trade. The firm said in a stock market statement on Thursday: \u201cThe directors intend to allow the business to continue to trade and the company continues to work alongside advisers in order to preserve as much value as possible for all stakeholders as it explores a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business.\u201d Conviviality supplies more than 700 off-licences and more than 23,000 pubs and restaurants including the JD Wetherspoon chain. The firm\u2019s shares remain suspended from the junior Aim market. Investors are likely to receive \u201clittle to nil\u201d value for their shares, the company said. PricewaterhouseCoopers accountancy firm is expected to manage the administration. Conviviality has reportedly had trouble with suppliers and some customers have been looking for alternative sources. An analyst at Langton Capital, Mark Brumby, said other operators such as Marston\u2019s, the brewery and pubs operator, had distribution companies that supply the free trade. Matthew Clark\u2019s assets are likely to find themselves with new owners. \u201cThe speed with which Conviviality has apparently unravelled will unsettle investors, suppliers and customers,\u201d Brumby added. \u201cOne potential source of problems is the extremely low-margin nature of the majority of the businesses that Conviviality was involved in. This was a problem shared with Carillion. It is harder to survive shocks when margins are low. The antidote is perhaps to be incredibly well run.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Aid organisations have condemned reports that the Turnbull government is considering yet another cut in the annual foreign aid budget \u2013 this time $400m \u2013 to find savings in the run-up to the budget. Mathias Cormann, the finance minister, has refused to buy into reports the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is modelling ways to cut a further 10% from the foreign aid budget. Australia\u2019s aid contribution has been cut repeatedly since 2013. Fairfax Media reported on Wednesday that Dfat was modelling a number of scenarios, including a substantial reduction in aid to south-east Asian nations that are considered to have reached \u201cmiddle-income status\u201d. An alternative scenario, according to the Fairfax report, is for Australia to stop delivering aid in one whole sector, such as health. Australia\u2019s foreign aid contribution, $3.9bn in 2017-18, is already its lowest on record, just 22 cents for every $100 of gross national income. On Thursday Cormann was asked if the reports were true but he would not buy into them or deny them. \u201cThe budget will be delivered on the second Tuesday of May,\u201d he said. Save the Children\u2019s director of public affairs and policy, Mat Tinkler, called on the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to rule out further cuts for developing countries. He said less than a day ago Australia\u2019s minister for international development, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, had indicated in the Senate that the government would maintain the overseas aid budget at $4bn a year over the next two years, so he was especially alarmed by the report. \u201cHow does that square with today\u2019s media reports that the government is considering hacking another $400m from the aid budget, a lifeline to many of the poorest people in our region?\u201d Tinkler said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling on the treasurer and prime minister to back the minister for international development and announce unequivocally that there will be no more cuts to overseas aid, now or into the future.\u201d In cumulative terms, Australia\u2019s foreign aid budget has been cut, and is projected to be cut, by almost one third \u2013 32.8% \u2013 since the Gillard government\u2019s 2013\u201314 budget, which represented a high point for aid funding. In the 2017 budget the government said Australia\u2019s foreign aid contribution would increase in line with inflation in 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319, but it decided to freeze Australia\u2019s contribution at $4bn in 2019\u201320 and 2020\u201321. According to the parliamentary library those two consecutive freezes \u2013 worth an estimated $303m in savings over the forward estimates \u2013 represented the fifth and sixth cuts, in real terms, to aid funding since 2013-14. The freezes also accelerated Australia\u2019s diminishing aid generosity: our foreign aid contribution as a proportion of gross national income is scheduled to fall to an unprecedented low of 20 cents for every $100 gross national income in 2020\u201321. \u201cThese cuts are also expected to see Australia fall further down the ladder of developed country donors and well below the current Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ODA/GNI average of 0.32%,\u201d the parliamentary library said. \u201cIn 2016 Australia ranked 17th out of 29 OECD bilateral donors for aid generosity, and is projected to fall to 21st in the coming years. Australia is currently the world\u2019s 13th largest economy.\u201d Tinkler said Australia was a wealthy, recession-free country and could afford to play its part helping the poorest people in the world through a world-class aid program. \u201cIf we don\u2019t then we risk damaging our reputation globally and undermining international efforts to create a stable and prosperous world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe urgently need to scale up aid but instead Australia has slashed overseas aid to developing countries by 30% in the last three years.\u201d with AAP",
