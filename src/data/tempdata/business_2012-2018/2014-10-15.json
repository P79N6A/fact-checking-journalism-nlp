      "bodyText": "There have been four major recessions in the West since the mid-1970s and each has followed a spike in the oil price. All downturns have their own peculiarities, but one common thread links the stagflation of the seventies to the mega-crash of 2009: dearer crude. The opposite also applies. A low oil price was a vital ingredient in the post-war Golden Age, and a falling oil price lubricated the strong and sustained growth of the 1990s. Logically, therefore, the 25% decline in the cost of crude since June should mean higher levels of activity. For that to happen, however, the oil price will have to fall a lot further, to somewhere around $50 a barrel. At $115 a barrel the price was consistent with rip-roaring levels of demand. In the meantime there will be winners and losers. The winners are the large net importers of oil and those that have high inflation rates, such as Turkey and India. Business costs will fall and consumers\u2019 incomes will stretch further. The losers are oil producers, which will see growth fall and budget deficits swell. Iran, subject to a crippling western embargo, needs an oil price of more than $140 a barrel to make its budget break even. Anything below $120 a barrel spells trouble for Venezuela and Nigeria. About $105 a barrel is Russia\u2019s cutoff point. At today\u2019s price even Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest producer, is starting to feel the pinch as it has used a high oil price to fund generous public spending. It needs $93 a barrel to balance the books. The problems are magnified for many of these countries because high oil prices have stunted the development of other sectors of the economy. In Russia, oil and gas accounts for 70% of exports. The country\u2019s struggling manufacturing sector relies heavily on orders from energy companies. Falling oil prices are the result of a glut of supply and an easing of demand from a slowing global economy. Saudi Arabia could try to arrest the decline by cutting production, although a similar ploy was notably unsuccessful in the mid-1980s. Despite having youth unemployment of above 30%, Riyadh would probably live with $80 barrel oil prices if it thought it would discourage Vladimir Putin from turning off the taps to the west. This is where the economics of oil mesh with geopolitics. One theory is that lower oil prices will force Russia to adopt a softer line over Ukraine, and Iran to come to terms over its nuclear programme. But a sharp dose of economic pain in countries that are highly volatile could have the opposite effect.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England should ignore the recent dip in inflation when setting interest rate policy, according to monetary policy committee (mpc) member Martin Weale, who indicated that he will continue to vote for an immediate hike in rates. Weale said the Bank should \u201clook through\u201d the current low level of inflation, just as it had previously ignored periods of high inflation, and place greater weight on the speed of the recovery and falling unemployment. Speaking at the University of Hull, the former academic warned that though economic forecasting remained inherently difficult, the tightening labour market could feed through into higher wages and rising prices by the end of 2015. To avoid an overreaction to a pay-fuelled inflation rise in a year\u2019s time, it was sensible to start tightening credit this year, he said. Weale is one of two policymakers on the nine-strong monetary policy committee to vote for higher interest rates in recent months. Along with Ian McCafferty, a former CBI economist, he has voted since August to raise rates by a quarter of 1%. He previously voted to raise interest rates in 2011, but shortly rejoined other committee members in keeping base rates at 0.5%. Many City economists support an early rate rise, while business groups remain more circumspect. The British Chambers of Commerce has lobbied consistently for Threadneedle Street to maintain its policy of low rates while the recovery remains fragile. Recent falls in the rate of inflation coupled with figures showing a slowdown in the manufacturing sector and weakening business sentiment have persuaded most analysts to push back the date earmarked for the first rate rise from the spring of next year to the summer. Phil Shaw, UK economist at Investec, abandoned his prediction of a November 2014 rate rise in favour of an August 2015 rise in his latest analysis for the fund manager\u2019s clients. In his speech Weale argued that the recovery was robust and that it was important to examine the rate at which spare capacity was being used up, as well as the level of spare capacity when judging the likely impact on prices. He said: \u201cMy own sense is that the margin of spare capacity is now small and it is currently being used up rapidly.\u201d He also argued that most business leaders he met said they were paying annual wage rises \u201cin the range of 2% to 3%\u201d, and the Bank\u2019s team of regional agents reported many businesses facing skills shortages. \u201cThe tightening of the labour market means that, instead of waiting to see wage growth pick up, I think it is appropriate to anticipate that wage growth. The margin of spare capacity is shrinking rapidly and all logic suggests that ought to lead to an increase in inflationary pressures over the two- to three-year horizon which concerns the committee. \u201cAn increase in Bank Rate of 1/4 point would be unlikely to slow that process to a halt immediately but there is a risk that, if the increase were delayed, inflation would be pushed above target or a rather sharper increase in Bank rate would be needed subsequently.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Global markets suffered sharp falls again as investor fears of an economic slowdown were reinforced by a poor set of US data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 246 points or 1.5% by the time European markets closed to 16,068, compared to its recent high of 17,265 reached on 18 September - the day before the record breaking Alibaba float. In the UK the FTSE 100 closed down 181.04 points or 2.83% at 6211.64, knocking some \u00a346bn off the value of Britain\u2019s top companies.

Meanwhile the Empire manufacturing report for New York fell to 6.17 this month, from 20.5 in September. This follows weaker than expected inflation data from China, prompting renewed fears of a slowdown there. Fears of a slowdown in the eurozone, in particular Germany, had already put markets under renewed pressure. There were also concerns about the European banking stress tests, the results of which of due to be published at the end of the month. On top of that, there are geopolitical concerns, including protests in Hong Kong, the turmoil in the Middle East and the spread of Ebola. Greece has also come under pressure, with the Athens market down nearly 7% on fears of new political turmoil. Meanwhile the flood of cheap money supplied by central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve, which has been propping up the market for a number of years is beginning to be turned off.

BG Group, without a permanent chief executive for six months, would never be able to land Lund, it was assumed. It is the smaller company and Lund seemed settled in Norway. Writing a large cheque has solved the problem. Lund will arrive next March with a Ronaldo-like pay package: a \u00a312m \u2018golden hello\u2019, a \u00a33m buy-out of his Statoil shares plus the chance to earn \u00a313.5m a year at BG. Naturally, Lund says there are factors beyond money at work \u2013 fresh challenges, the need for Statoil to have a new leader, etc etc. And, as you would also expect, BG prefers to focus on a figure of \u00a39m-a-year, which it thinks more accurately reflects the net present value of awards that rely on performance hurdles being met. However you cut it, though, this is a mighty award, even for a FTSE 100 company worth \u00a343bn. Even on the \u00a39m figure, Lund will still be earning about seven times as much as he did in Norway. BG needs to call a special meeting of shareholders to get approval for the \u00a312m golden hello. Its pitch at the meeting will be nothing more elevated than \u201ctrust us\u201d. Lund will collect that \u00a312m, in the form of BG shares, if he meets \u201cpersonal performance criteria\u201d but these will not be published because the judgment of the remuneration committee at the time is all that counts. All eyes, then, will be on the chair of BG\u2019s pay committee, Sir John Hood, who also serves at WPP \u2013 not a company known for its restraint pay. Despite that glaring shortcoming, expect City fund managers to laud the hiring of Lund and hold their noses on his pay. The unspoken message from BG\u2019s boardroom is very simple: look, last year we promoted Chris Finlayson to be chief executive and he lasted only 15 months; we\u2019ve got a $20bn LNG plant opening in Australia and we can\u2019t afford any more production screw-ups; we\u2019re desperate.",

Britain\u2019s third largest exploration and production business behind Shell and BP has been desperate to find a major figure to lead the business after a couple of turbulent years and the exit in March of its former leader Chris Finlayson. 51-year-old Lund has had a stellar 10-year career at the top of Statoil in Norway, transforming it from a local operator into an important global force, active in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico and Russian Arctic. There will be speculation that Lund could lead cash-rich BG into similar new geographical areas either through the acquisition of drilling licenses or companies. Lund had been expected to move into Oslo politics but he has been lured to BG with a generous pay package that is likely to be worth around seven times what he was paid \u2013 even if he fails to meet all his incentive targets. Part of his package is nearly half a million pounds for \u201crelocation\u201d and a \u00a33m buyout of shares he was owed at Statoil. BG justified the remuneration, which is made up of BG shares, salary, bonus, pension and long-term incentive awards \u2013 saying it was \u201ccompetitive in the international oil and gas industry\u201d. Andrew Gould, chairman of BG, said: \u201cHelge\u2019s track record speaks for itself.

I look forward to joining this organisation and working with BG\u2019s people to develop the company\u2019s full potential.\u201d BG was originally part of the state-owned British Gas but was privatised and hived off from other arms of the business now operating at Centrica and British Gas.",

      "bodyText": "Aldermore, a specialist bank for small businesses, has scrapped its planned \u00a3800m flotation, blaming volatile stock markets. The bank said on 3 October it intended to proceed with its initial public offering (IPO) despite market jitters about prospects for economic growth and share prices. Since then it is said to have faced pressure from investors to cut its intended flotation price. But on Wednesday the group said: \u201cDue to the recent deterioration of global equity markets, Aldermore\u2019s board and shareholders have elected not to proceed at this time with the initial public offering. Aldermore continues to perform strongly, with excellent organic loan growth and a proven track record of delivery through its modern, digital platform.\u201d The bank is the latest company to scrap a flotation or rein in its price expectations as share prices fall from their recent peaks. Miller Homes, one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, cancelled its IPO on the same day that Aldermore declared its intention to press ahead. Jimmy Choo narrowed the price range for its float this week, though the shoemaker denied it was reacting to market pressures. Aldermore had set a price range for its initial public offering of between 217p and 265p per share. At the top end, the business would have been valued at \u00a3870m. It planned to raise \u00a375m by selling new shares to fund growth, with AnaCap also cashing in part of its investment. The FTSE 100 index has fallen by more than 7% in the past month as investors have become increasingly worried about a revival of the eurozone crisis, slowing growth in China and Germany, and turmoil in the Middle East. Even before recent market falls, investors had become more choosy after a series of IPOs left them out of pocket during the flotation frenzy early this year. But after companies raised \u00a312.2bn in the past nine months, flotation advisers expected the market to pick up again after the summer lull. So-called challenger banks\u2019 IPOs have been popular with investors keen to tap economic growth through lenders unencumbered by misconduct scandals and the hangover from the financial crisis. TSB and OneSavings have floated and Virgin Money has announced plans to raise \u00a3150m through a listing this month. Aldermore \u2013 founded in 2009 by private equity firm AnaCap and headed by former Barclays banker Philip Monks \u2013 focuses on lending to small businesses and homeowners. It has no branches and has picked up customers from larger banks that are reducing lending and building capital to meet tougher rules from regulators. The company said AnaCap, its majority shareholder, would remain as a long-term investor.",

Miller Homes, one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/03/housebuilder-miller-homes-cancels-float-plan\" title=\"\">cancelled its IPO</a> on the same day that Aldermore declared its intention to press ahead. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/oct/13/jimmy-choo-float-lower-price-ipo-share\" title=\"\">Jimmy Choo narrowed the price range for its float</a> this week, though the shoemaker denied it was reacting to market pressures.</p> <p>Aldermore had set a price range for its initial public offering of between 217p and 265p per share. At the top end, the business would have been valued at \u00a3870m. It planned to raise \u00a375m by selling new shares to fund growth, with AnaCap also cashing in part of its investment.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 index has fallen by more than 7% in the past month as investors have become increasingly worried about a revival of the eurozone crisis, slowing growth in China and Germany, and turmoil in the Middle East.</p> <p>Even before recent market falls, investors had become more choosy after a series of IPOs left them out of pocket during the flotation frenzy early this year. But after companies raised \u00a312.2bn in the past nine months, flotation advisers expected the market to pick up again after the summer lull.</p> <p>So-called challenger banks\u2019 IPOs have been popular with investors keen to tap economic growth through lenders unencumbered by misconduct scandals and the hangover from the financial crisis. TSB and OneSavings have floated and Virgin Money has announced plans to raise \u00a3150m through a listing this month.</p> <p>Aldermore \u2013 founded in 2009 by private equity firm AnaCap and headed by former Barclays banker Philip Monks \u2013 focuses on lending to small businesses and homeowners. It has no branches and has picked up customers from larger banks that are reducing lending and building capital to meet tougher rules from regulators.</p> <p>The company said AnaCap, its majority shareholder, would remain as a long-term investor.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chicago-based AbbVie has got cold feet over its planned $54bn (\u00a334bn) takeover of British drugmaker Shire. The AbbVie board meets next Monday to reconsider the recommendation it made to shareholders in July to back the deal, in light of new US Treasury rules designed to discourage American companies from redomiciling abroad to cut their tax bill. The deal could become the biggest to be wrecked by the White House\u2019s crackdown on tax inversions. Here is what analysts made of the news. Some wonder whether the deal could be renegotiated, while others think it is dead in the water. Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon still expects the deal to go through. He notes the anti-inversion changes will require Senate support and \u201cthis is far from being a certainty and will likely take considerable time\u201d. The board of Abbvie has a responsibility to its shareholders to consider new facts relating to any ongoing event that impacts shareholder value. Ultimately we expect the deal to go through. The board meeting on 20 October will likely consider the use of so called hopscotch loans. The use of such loans to finance a transaction relies on a foreign subsidiary of an inverted company could lend money to the newly incorporated foreign parent. Ana Nicholls, healthcare analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: It is hardly surprising that AbbVie is rethinking its Shire merger in the light of the new US tax inversion rules. One of the big benefits of the proposed US$54.6bn deal was that, by shifting the combined company\u2019s tax base to the UK, it would allow AbbVie to avoid paying high US tax rates on its profits. Barclays reckoned the resulting tax savings would amount to US$1.3bn a year by 2020. Earlier this month, Salix cited the new rules when it pulled out of a merger with Cosmo, another Irish company. But there are other benefits to the Shire merger besides tax savings. AbbVie faces patent expiry on its main product, Humira, in 2016 and is keen for new product to help fill its pipeline. Shire not only offers a strong line-up of ADHD drugs but also a promising portfolio of drugs for rare diseases, which command a higher price from insurers and health funds. Its new drug pipeline is also fairly strong, with seven drugs in late-stage development or awaiting marketing approval. This is only a rethink, in short, and AbbVie\u2019s board may instead recommend a modification of the deal - which could mean trying to renegotiate the price or change other terms of the deal. It is notable that the Shire chief executive, who resisted AbbVie\u2019s initial offers so strongly, is now proclaiming his enthusiasm for the deal. However, Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, was not convinced. The likelihood of the AbbVie/Shire deal has all but disappeared judging by the market reaction, whilst the possibility of Pfizer approaching AstraZeneca anew must also be in serious jeopardy, both falling foul of the potential tightening of US tax inversion laws. On a connected but separate issue, even the perennial target of bid speculation, medical company Smith &amp; Nephew, has also seen its shares hit on the read across. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Shareholders in Shire must be doing a double-take this morning with shares back trading at mid-June levels after AbbVie announced that it was reconsidering their $54bn merger in light of recent (22 Sept) rule changes by the US treasury designed to discourage what is known as \u2018tax inversion\u2019 (cross-border deal, pay bulk of tax in lower rate country). Unsurprisingly Shire says AbbVie should proceed, and if it the deal collapses it still stands to pick up a handsome $1.6bn in deal break fees, however, that\u2019s far from compensation for the \u00a310bn market cap gains (40% share price rise) which many considered to be in the bag with the deal set to close in Q4. The potential for a 20 Oct modification of the deal or indeed a full withdrawal is likely to have a significant knock-on for sentiment towards corporate activity given how this year\u2019s strong flow of M&amp;A helped markets towards recent highs. Beware the fallout. Charles Stanley analyst Rae Ellingham said: Given the uncertainty surrounding the offer we consider investors should view Shire on a stand-alone basis, with a transaction with AbbVie offering upside potential. Shire\u2019s FY earnings are expected to grow in the low-to- mid thirty percent range, the shares are trading in line with large pharmas but at a discount to speciality pharmas, and we expect continued good performance from the group. Ben Jones partner and tax expert at law firm Eversheds, said: It is of course right and proper for the board of AbbVie to give further consideration to the proposed merger with Shire in light of the changed fiscal environment in which the merger would occur. Leaving aside the underlying issues with so-called \u201ccorporate inversions\u201d, this reconsideration and the potential for the merger to collapse (with significant wasted costs incurred) highlights the serious issues with reactive changes to established rules implemented with immediate effect. A key requirement for businesses across the world is certainty as to the environment in which they operate, be it from a tax, legal, regulatory or other perspective. Business cannot operate effectively when the playing field is changed overnight. To avoid prejudice to businesses operating in accordance with the pre-existing rules, changes such as those made to US tax rules relating to corporate inversions really need to be preannounced with sufficient time for business to react.",

To avoid prejudice to businesses operating in accordance with the pre-existing rules, changes such as those made to US tax rules relating to corporate inversions really need to be preannounced with sufficient time for business to react.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><br></strong></p>",

Meanwhile <strong>Tui Travel</strong> has added 10.1p to 347.7p and cruise company <strong>Carnival</strong> is 56p better at \u00a322.69.</p> <p>The oil price is falling as the evidence mounts of a slowdown in the global economy and thus lower demand for crude.</p> <p>But if travel companies are doing well as a result, oil companies are clearly not. <strong>Tullow Oil</strong> is 13p lower at 505.5p while <strong>Royal Dutch Shell </strong>A shares are down 43.5p at 2130.5p.</p> <p>However the main negative influence on the markets is the news that US group AbbVie said it was reconsidering its $55bn bid for Shire. Part of the reason for the deal was the benefit to AbbVie of relocating to Europe to get the benefit of lower tax rates.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are on the slide again as the healthcare sector was hit by news that a US bid for Shire may not go ahead. But the continuing decline in the oil price has once more benefited travel and transport companies, thanks to the prospect of lower fuel costs. Recently hit by worries about how the spread of the Ebola virus would hit the sector, British Airways owner International Airlines Group has recovered another 10.5p to 350.1p and easyJet is up 45p at \u00a314.07 as Brent crude lost another 1.2% to $83.99. Meanwhile Tui Travel has added 10.1p to 347.7p and cruise company Carnival is 56p better at \u00a322.69. The oil price is falling as the evidence mounts of a slowdown in the global economy and thus lower demand for crude. But if travel companies are doing well as a result, oil companies are clearly not. Tullow Oil is 13p lower at 505.5p while Royal Dutch Shell A shares are down 43.5p at 2130.5p. However the main negative influence on the markets is the news that US group AbbVie said it was reconsidering its $55bn bid for Shire. Part of the reason for the deal was the benefit to AbbVie of relocating to Europe to get the benefit of lower tax rates. But plans by the US government to clamp down on this so-called tax inversion has meant AbbVie has cooled on the idea. Shire shares are down \u00a313.13 or 25% to \u00a338.27, while AstraZeneca - which was in the sights of Pfizer partly for similar tax reasons - is down 144p to 4262.5p. Smith and Nephew, also seen as a possible US target, has fallen 27p to 947p. The three have knocked around 46 points of the FTSE 100, helping to push it 71.52 points lower to 6321.16. Meawhile the usual concerns remain to worry investors - a slowdown in the global economy, with the latest weak Chinese inflation data added to the theme, Hong Kong protests, the Ebola situation and the troubles in the Middle East. News that UK unemployment had fallen more than expected did little to revive the market. One UK company which could fall to a US predator is CSR, up 200.5p at 859p. Qualcomm has trumped US rival Microchip Technology - which recently issued a warning which knocked back the chip sector - to buy the bluetooth specialist. Qualcomm has agreed to pay 900p a share for CSR, which had been in talks with Microchip having earlier rebuffed its first approaches. Analysts at Jefferies said: With a firm price now in the open we can\u2019t rule out other bidders but only a handful of semiconductor companies could compete with Qualcomm on this, in our view.",
