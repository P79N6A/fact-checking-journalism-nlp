      "bodyText": "Cardinal Brady, the head of Ireland's Catholic church, has urged G8 leaders to make good on their pledge to tackle aggressive tax avoidance at a summit later this month, declaring that \"paying a fair share of taxes\" is a \"moral obligation\". The comments, thought to be his most outspoken remarks on the sensitive subject of international tax reform, were made in a letter to political leaders before the G8 meeting this month in Northern Ireland, signed by senior Catholic bishops from all G8 nations. Ireland is not a member of the G8 and has been criticised for its approach to tax competitiveness. No one was available from Ireland's Catholic Bishops' Conference to elaborate on Brady's decision to add his name to the letter. Last month, US senators described Ireland as a \"tax haven\", accusing it of facilitating a multibillion-dollar tax avoidance structure for Apple. Days earlier, politicians in the UK attacked Google for using Ireland as a base from which to book UK sales \u2013 a move that meant it would not have to pay HMRC tax on any resulting profits. Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge described the arrangement as \"devious, calculated and in my view unethical\". Tax justice campaigners argue that Ireland's ultra-low corporation tax rate of 12.5%, combined with a series of additional tax incentives, is having a corrosive impact on tax coffers elsewhere, particularly poorer nations. In their letter to world leaders, Brady and the bishops from G8 nations said: \"By asking first how a given policy will affect the poor and the vulnerable, you can help assure that the common good of all is served. As a human family we are only as healthy as our weakest members.\" \"We pray your meeting will be blessed by a spirit of collaboration that enables you to take steps to improve nutrition, reduce hunger and poverty, and strengthen just tax, trade and transparency policies for the common good of all.\" The bishops' remarks come as a new report from Ernst &amp; Young found Ireland to be one of Europe's most successful nations at attracting multinational investment and creating jobs. \"A long-standing inward investment champion, Ireland had its best year for foreign direct investment in a decade in 2012 \u2026 This success story is sorely needed in an economy suffering from weak consumer spending, high unemployment, high levels of household debt and ongoing austerity.\" E&amp;Y, which is auditor to both Google and Apple, added: \"A corporate tax rate of just 12.5% remains a key attraction.\" Invest in Ireland, the agency that recruits foreign multinationals, said overseas firms that had been attracted to Ireland contributed \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.3bn) of the country's \u20ac3.5bn corporation tax take. The bishops are the latest public figures to declare that tax fairness is a moral \u2014 and not just a legal \u2014 issue. In January David Cameron told the World Economic Forum in Davos he would use Britain's presidency of the G8 to tackle abusive behaviour. \"Some forms of avoidance have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these are ethical issues.\" However, some business leaders, accountants and lawyers are furious that morality has been allowed to encroach on corporate and personal tax obligations \u2014 traditionally a straightforward legal matter. Last month CBI president Roger Carr attacked the moralisers. \"Tax payments are not, and should not be \u2026 viewed as a down payment on social acceptability, or a contribution made by choice in order to defuse public anger or political attack.\" A member of the prime minister's business advisory group, he urged G8 leaders to avoid the moral debate, declaring \"it's all about the rules\". Like many, christian aid charity Trocaire, the overseas development agency of the Irish Catholic church, has long-campaigned for tax reform. It said: \"The ability to generate revenue is a key aspect of development because the monies help to provide basic but vital support to poor people. We know from recent reports that tax avoidance deprives the developing world of \u20ac123bn annually. This is not just. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that developing countries lose three times more to tax havens than they receive each year in aid assistance.\"",

    "webTitle": "Innovative companies 'hit by bank lending freeze'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's most innovative small businesses are more likely to be punished by banks in a lending freeze than firms operating in established markets, according to a study. More than one-in-three innovative small firms that sought finance between 2010 and 2012 failed to secure the funding they needed, which was almost triple the rate in 2007/8. Companies launching a new product or process were considered risky in almost 38% of cases compared with firms considered \"non-innovators\" that suffered a 22% rejection rate, up from 11.5% in 2007. The report \u2013 by economic thinktanks the Big Innovation Centre and the Work Foundation \u2013 said a general credit squeeze was affecting innovative firms more than others. \"With innovative small and medium-sized companies playing a crucial role in creating jobs and raising productivity, this highlights a systemic failure in the financial system that is holding back the UK economy,\" it said. Ministers have put in place measures to breath life back into the banking system and encourage credit but with little effect. Recent figures from the Bank of England showed a sharp fall in the amount borrowed by businesses. Non-financial firms paid off \u00a33bn of loans in April, compared with an average monthly repayment of \u00a31.3bn over the previous six months. Year-on-year, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) borrowing fell 3.3%. A Bank of England scheme to boost lending, known as Funding for Lending, aims to pump up to \u00a380bn of extra credit into the economy. So far it has only prevented some banks from withdrawing more credit from the system, offsetting banks that have expanded their loan books. The report \u2013 Credit and the crisis: Access to finance for innovative small firms since the recession \u2013 drew on responses from almost 11,000 SMEs and shows how access to finance for all SMEs has worsened since the start of the recession, with failure rates for securing loans now double those of 2007/8. The report found that half of all SMEs had difficulties finding credit after 2010, while one in four did not receive any funding at all. Author Neil Lee said: \"The future growth of the UK economy depends on investment in new products and services. Yet it is harder for innovative small firms to obtain finance than their peers. A lack of finance for the firms which need it most will be a long-term drag on the UK economy. Without action from policymakers, banks are unlikely to change their lending behaviour.\" A separate report in collaboration with Nesta, a charity funded by the Lottery that promotes innovation, raises concerns over \"the long-term disconnect between capital raised by banks and investment in innovative activities\". The report, Two Spheres That Don't Touch: The relationship between British finance and British innovation, found that in the run up to the financial crisis, investment in innovation was falling as a proportion of total capital. \"Between 2001 and 2007, total capital raised by banks increased by \u00a31340bn, while investment in innovation rose by just \u00a326bn.

Recent figures from the Bank of England showed a sharp fall in the amount borrowed by businesses.</p> <p>Non-financial firms paid off \u00a33bn of loans in April, compared with an average monthly repayment of \u00a31.3bn over the previous six months. Year-on-year, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) borrowing fell 3.3%.</p> <p>A Bank of England scheme to boost lending, known as Funding for Lending, aims to pump up to \u00a380bn of extra credit into the economy. So far it has only prevented some banks from withdrawing more credit from the system, offsetting banks that have expanded their loan books.</p> <p>The report \u2013 Credit and the crisis: Access to finance for innovative small firms since the recession \u2013 drew on responses from almost 11,000 SMEs and shows how access to finance for all SMEs has worsened since the start of the recession, with failure rates for securing loans now double those of 2007/8.</p> <p>The report found that half of all SMEs had difficulties finding credit after 2010, while one in four did not receive any funding at all.</p> <p>Author Neil Lee said: \"The future growth of the UK economy depends on investment in new products and services. Yet it is harder for innovative small firms to obtain finance than their peers. A lack of finance for the firms which need it most will be a long-term drag on the UK economy. Without action from policymakers, banks are unlikely to change their lending behaviour.\"</p> <p>A separate report in collaboration with Nesta, a charity funded by the Lottery that promotes innovation, raises concerns over \"the long-term disconnect between capital raised by banks and investment in innovative activities\".</p> <p>The report, Two Spheres That Don't Touch: The relationship between British finance and British innovation, found that in the run up to the financial crisis, investment in innovation was falling as a proportion of total capital.</p> <p>\"Between 2001 and 2007, total capital raised by banks increased by \u00a31340bn, while investment in innovation rose by just \u00a326bn.

Almanza, who joined the company in April from BG Group, repeatedly insisted that G4S was not in breach of international law. One shareholder claimed that \"children as young as 12 are being held in solitary confinement at G4S prisons\". He asked: \"When will [the board] do the right thing and withdraw from providing services to the Israeli prison service.\" John Hilary, executive director of War on Want, which holds one G4S share in order to attend the company's annual general meetings, said he was \"profoundly concerned with G4S's exposure in Palestine\". Almanza insisted G4S was not complacent. \"We believe this contract has not breached international law and we will continue to keep these matters under review, \" he said. \"If we were making five times as much money in Israel, our judgement wouldn't be any different.\" G4S employs 620,000 people in 125 countries, although fewer than 1% of its staff are in Israel. It recently announced that it was pulling out of providing a prison and barrier checkpoints in the West Bank from 2015, but will continue to run prisons inside Israel. G4S chair John Connolly also sought to reassure shareholders the company had tightened risk procedures following the Olympics debacle that cost the company \u00a388m. The meeting was twice disrupted by flash protests over the death of Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan national who died while he was being deported from the UK. Mubenga had been restrained by three G4S security guards. Nikolaj Villumsen, a shareholder and Danish MP, said after the meeting he was concerned that G4S had not listened to criticism over its Israeli prison contracts. \"In Denmark, it is a huge issue and in the city council of Copenhagen they are discussing whether to sever co-operation with G4S,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has predicted a deeper than expected slump in the eurozone economy as its president, Mario Draghi, said the institution had discussed negative interest rates in a bid to kickstart growth. The ECB said the economy of the euro's 17 members will shrink by 0.6% this year compared with the previous forecast of a 0.5% decline. However, the bank was more optimistic about 2014, inching up its growth forecast from 1% to 1.1%. Draghi also reiterated that ECB is considering unconventional policies, such as charging banks interest on deposits, in order to force them to offload money and lend to small companies. Speaking after the latest governing council meeting, he said the ECB is \"reflecting on issuing forward guidance\" on its monetary policy, which was adopted last year by Ben Bernanke, the US Federal reserve head. He added: \"We see no reason to act on all these fronts. These are all measures we keep on the shelf.\" Asked if the decision to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% was unanimous, Draghi said there was a consensus that \"there wasn't any direction change that would grant immediate action\". In the past, he has used the term consensus to signal a large majority rather than unanimity. \"This can be seen as a reaction to the slight improvement in the purchasing managers indices, which seem to signal that the worst is over in the eurozone,\" said David Kohl, chief economist for Germany at the Swiss bank Julius Baer. Amid criticism of his record over the last year, when much of the eurozone has fallen into recession, Draghi blamed individual governments for their failure to sweep away labour rules that restrict hiring and the adoption of new working practices. Next week the ECB will come under intense scrutiny following an appeal to the German constitutional court against its most recent rescue package. Last year Draghi announced that countries, fearing they might go bust, could access funds via a new policy known as Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT). He said legal documentation supporting then policy would be released, possibly next week. The OMT is credited with calming international money markets after the near collapse of the eurozone last summer. Draghi famously said he would do \"whatever it takes\" to keep the currency club together prior to its launch. Critics of the OMT policy in Germany say that it acts as a collective euro-wide subsidy that undermines German sovereignty, though no country has yet tapped its funds.",

      "bodyText": "Walmart, the world's biggest retailer, holds its annual meeting in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Friday. The giant event attracts workers and shareholders from around the world and is usually a celebration of the company's unique corporate culture. About 14,000 people are expected at the Bud Walton arena to hear the company's executives speak. They can also expect to surprised by guest appearances from celebrities such as Beyonc\u00e9 and Justin Timberlake that show the retailer's pulling power. It's also a chance to see the Waltons, Walmart's founding family and some of the richest people on the planet. But this year's meeting may be less adulatory. The company is facing pressure at home after a series of strikes and protests over pay and conditions. Walmart's sourcing from factories with poor safety records is also under fire. Lobby group Making Change at Walmart raised over $9,000 on the crowdsourcing site Indiegogo to bring to the meeting Kalpona Akter, a former child textile laborer from Bangladesh. She is being accompanied by Sumi Abedin, a survivor of the deadly fire that killed at least 112 garment workers at the Tazreen Fashion factory on the outskirts of Dhaka last year. Akter will call on Walmart to sign a legally binding agreement to improve working conditions in her country's textile factories that many of the company's rivals have signed following a building collapse in April that left over 1,127 dead. Striking workers from union-supported group Our Walmart are also protesting against pay and conditions outside the event. They will be joined by workers from Walmart's warehouse supply chain, which has been hit by allegations of poor conditions, wage theft, retaliation against workers who complain and a series of strikes. Here are three of the protesters hoping to make an impact on Walmart at this year's meeting. Kalpona Akter, 36, sweatshop critic and ex-child garment worker Bangladesh's textile workers work 11 to 14 hours a day, six, sometimes seven, days a week for $37 a month, says Akter.

Workers have little choice but to put up with the conditions, she said. \"There is truly no alternative,\" said Akter. \"This is the biggest industry we have.\" She believes it is up to retailers to change conditions but Walmart and Gap are resisting signing a global accord that some of its rivals have signed which promises binding, verifiable safety standards for Bangladesh factories. \"This is happening because of a pattern of denial by these giant retailers like Walmart,\" she said. \"There really will not be any change until they take responsibility,\" she said.

Photograph: DANIEL ROLAND/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities has torn into Mario Draghi following today's press conference (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/06/eurozone-crisis-ebc-rates-greece-imf#block-51b0824fe4b00fb18c08e9c8\">see 1.32pm onwards</a></strong>).&#xa0;</p> <p>In a note sent to City clients, Ostwald warns that the ECB president has taken the final steps on the road from \"OMT's hero\" to \"policy ammmuntion free zero\".</p> <p>By puffing his bond-buying programme, failing to announce measures to help small firms, and hailing the ECB's conservative nature, Draghi looks a less powerful ECB president then before, Ostwald argued.</p> <h2>Here's the full note:</h2> <p>While there will be plenty of market participants who view this ECB press conference as 'boring', 'dull' or some other similar epithet, it does in fact signal the demise of 'Super Mario\", the man who supposedly saved the Euro.</p> <p>Last month's rate cut was clearly an exercise of a politically unaware case of railroading through an ECB rate cut, probably because Draghi was fearful for his reputation as \"Mr Euro\". Unfortunately for Mr Draghi, he forgot that line one of his job description is: to remember that one must be sensitive at all times to the political and personal complexities of being ECB president. He did not, and now looks to be a very lame duck, a \"has been\" actor recalling his greatest moment (\"the OMT was my idea\" and very effective) or James Cagney in White heat (\"look Mum I am on top of the world).</p> <p>His attempts to jawbone financial markets into a sense of security highlight the lack of support from his fellow ECB council members, which have been increasingly evident in recent weeks. After all what does it mean when he says there was: 'ample discussion of \"of nonstandard measures\", \"discussed negative deposit facility\", the ECB is reflecting \"on other types of forward guidance\" , \"if EIB produces something, will look at taking it as collateral\" and that he is \"confident single resolution mechanism will be in place by time single supervisor takes over\", and then tops this all off with \"We are all in all more conservative vs. other central banks\"? Forget any personal battles with Bundesbank's Weidmann, Draghi is fighting most of the rest of the ECB council.</p> <p>It means there is complete disagreement on the ECB council, it means his powers of persuasion as ECB president and the architect of the OMT are as strong in currency terms as 'bitcoin', and his policy of 'jawboning' markets with platitudes is dead in the water. To be sure, there is a confluence of events internationally, above all the Fed \"tapering\" debate and the rising doubts about the potential efficacy of Abenomics, but ultimately Draghi is just another dead man walking, a man who fits well with that line from Talking Heads' classic Psychokiller: \"\"You start a conversation; you can't even finish it. You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything. When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed\" .....</p> <p>...the enduring impression that is likely to remain is that the ECB is out of policy ammunition, and that Draghi's activism is no longer supported by many members of the council, who are fed up to the back to the teeth with politicians failing to use the time that ECB policy has being buying them to implement structural reforms.\"</p> <p>Perhaps one should the question: \"Draghi dead; OMT dead?\", especially given the IMF admissions overnight on the first Greek bail-out?</p> <p>[end]</p> <p>And here's some more reaction:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SonyKapoor/statuses/342641785459310592\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>My one line conclusion from today&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ECB&amp;src=hash\">#ECB</a> presser &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Draghi&amp;src=hash\">#Draghi</a>&#39;s sheen is wearing off&quot;</p>&mdash; Sony Kapoor (@SonyKapoor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonyKapoor/statuses/342641785459310592\">June 6, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJSong/statuses/342642264541122561\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>As the ECB retains a reactionary approach, could see the recession get carried into 2014 IMO.</p>&mdash; David Song (@DavidJSong) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJSong/statuses/342642264541122561\">June 6, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-06T14:41:50.580Z\">at 3.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51b09355e4b0cc64243720a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-06T13:49:09.476Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Draghi ended his press conference with a pop at Europe's weaker countries, and their need for reform (following a question from a Spanish journalist).</p> <p>Why, he asks, did these nations rely on \"protected industries\" for growth during the \"fairytale times\" of the last decade?

More democraticac accountability is needed to keep the Fund in line.</p> <p>Here's her full statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is all well and good of the IMF to admit that mistakes have been made. But the real question is whether lessons have been learnt. The IMF was equally critical of the handling of the Asian crisis as it was on Greece. Cyprus was not handled efficiently either. So, are lessons really being learned?</p> <p>It is clear that the Troika needs to be rethought. For example, it needs to be more coordinated in its work and able to take more time to take decisions when conflicting models emerge. It also needs to factor in the preservation of the single market into its decisions. Since Greece the workings of the Troika have obviously not improved, as the case of Cyprus clearly shows. There, the IMF put its own preferences before the country's economic sustainability.</p> <p>The Troika will also need to become more democratically accountable, above all else to the European Parliament. It is not possible that decisions which strike at the very heart of a country continue to be taken without the proper level of accountability.

In our opinion, this is the IMF's latest attempt to put pressure on its European partners in the bail-out programme to provide more debt relief to Greece, in order to reduce Greek public debt to substantially below 110% of GDP by 2022 (from around 175% of GDP this year); this is the IMF's target to achieve debt sustainability in Greece.</p> <p>There is also a risk that the IMF is positioning itself to withdraw from the rescue programme altogether, especially if euro zone debt relief is not forthcoming. The IMF has already bent its own rules so that it could continue lending to Greece; the IMF normally only lends to a country if its debt sustainability is guaranteed for at least one year out. Moreover, the size of the IMF's support to Greece (amounting to 2,159% of Greece's quota in the Fund) has also raised concerns within the Fund.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Koehring</strong> adds that the Greek government may use the IMF report as a bargaining tool in its negotiations with the troika in order to ease the austerity programme, by cutting sales taxes or delaying (again) its public-sector layoff plan.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51b0618ee4b029ed1cfbe7c7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-06T10:16:47.306Z\">11.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German factory orders drop</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just in: German factory orders slumped unexpectedly in April, casting doubt on the theory that Germany's manufacturing base is bouncing back from its winter blues.</strong></p> <p>Industrial orders fell by 2.3% in April \u2013 the biggest monthly fall since last November.

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed sharply lower once more, with the falls accelarating as investors expressed their disappointment with the lack of any action from the European Central Bank. Mario Draghi's subsequent press conference (from here) seemed to suggest the bank would be sitting on its hands for some time, not what those expecting some stimulus to the flagging European economy wanted to hear. So the response from the markets was clear: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 83.20 points or 1.3% lower at 6336.11 \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 1.19% at 8098.81 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.99% lower at3814.28 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB lost 2.63% to 16,525.07 \u2022 Spain's Ibex dropped 0.89% to 8216.7 Overnight the Nikkei lost another 0.8% bringing it close to bear market territory - it is now 19.3% below its peak, near the necessary 20% decline. Ahead of the US non-farm payroll figures on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.27% or 40 points lower. Meanwhile Spanish and Italian bond yields were heading higher, another result of Draghi's deliberations. And on that note, it's time to wrap up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we're back again tomorrow. Cyprus based blogger Yiannis Mouzakis has some forthright views on the IMF's mea culpa from last night. The piece is called Honey I shrunk the Greeks and here's a flavour: Greek society has paid a heavy price for the flaws in the design of the first program. The IMF admits that an early debt restructuring would have eased the burden of adjustment on Greece and most importantly would have contributed towards a less dramatic blow on the economy, employment, the prospects of the Greek youth and the purpose of many others. A Greek politician in the early days of the program said that the Memorandum with the troika was a \u201cblessing\u201d for the country. Indeed a blessing it was but primarily for the eurozone. It is time to return the favour soon. More criticism of Mario Draghi's press conference, and its negative effect on the markets. Dr Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy writes: Today wasn't Mario Draghi's finest hour - far from it. While this month's ECB press conference was never going to be an easy one given the souring market backdrop, Mr Draghi conspicuously failed to allay concerns that the ECB has run out of monetary policy ammunition and that the governing council is deeply divided over what course of action - if any - to take. What's more, the ECB president drew attention to the double-edged sword of the OMT bond-buying programme. While Mr Draghi continues to champion the scheme as the most successful form of verbal intervention ever, he is increasingly frustrated that the OMT programme has lulled eurozone politicians into a complacent slumber. Mr Draghi appears to have something of a love-and-hate relationship with his own bond-buying programme. At a time when central bank policy action is the focal point for investor anxiety, this is what not the right time for Mr Draghi to disappoint the markets. Yet this is what he did. Mario Draghi's performance has not gone down well in the bond markets either. Spanish and Italian debt has slid in value as investors digest the lack of new action from the ECB. The yield (interest rate) on Spain's 10-year bonds has jumped by 25 basis points to 4.69%, while Italy's is up 25 basis poionts at 4.39%. Both big moves -- and not encouraging for market confidence in either country. There are other factors at play.... traders may be jittery ahead of tomorrow's US jobs data. And the escalating protests in Turkey have driven its stock market down 8%. In London, the FTSE 100 is off 60 points, or 1%, as the trading day approaches a close.... Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities has torn into Mario Draghi following today's press conference (see 1.32pm onwards). In a note sent to City clients, Ostwald warns that the ECB president has taken the final steps on the road from \"OMT's hero\" to \"policy ammmuntion free zero\". By puffing his bond-buying programme, failing to announce measures to help small firms, and hailing the ECB's conservative nature, Draghi looks a less powerful ECB president then before, Ostwald argued. Here's the full note: While there will be plenty of market participants who view this ECB press conference as 'boring', 'dull' or some other similar epithet, it does in fact signal the demise of 'Super Mario\", the man who supposedly saved the Euro. Last month's rate cut was clearly an exercise of a politically unaware case of railroading through an ECB rate cut, probably because Draghi was fearful for his reputation as \"Mr Euro\". Unfortunately for Mr Draghi, he forgot that line one of his job description is: to remember that one must be sensitive at all times to the political and personal complexities of being ECB president. He did not, and now looks to be a very lame duck, a \"has been\" actor recalling his greatest moment (\"the OMT was my idea\" and very effective) or James Cagney in White heat (\"look Mum I am on top of the world). His attempts to jawbone financial markets into a sense of security highlight the lack of support from his fellow ECB council members, which have been increasingly evident in recent weeks. After all what does it mean when he says there was: 'ample discussion of \"of nonstandard measures\", \"discussed negative deposit facility\", the ECB is reflecting \"on other types of forward guidance\" , \"if EIB produces something, will look at taking it as collateral\" and that he is \"confident single resolution mechanism will be in place by time single supervisor takes over\", and then tops this all off with \"We are all in all more conservative vs. other central banks\"? Forget any personal battles with Bundesbank's Weidmann, Draghi is fighting most of the rest of the ECB council. It means there is complete disagreement on the ECB council, it means his powers of persuasion as ECB president and the architect of the OMT are as strong in currency terms as 'bitcoin', and his policy of 'jawboning' markets with platitudes is dead in the water. To be sure, there is a confluence of events internationally, above all the Fed \"tapering\" debate and the rising doubts about the potential efficacy of Abenomics, but ultimately Draghi is just another dead man walking, a man who fits well with that line from Talking Heads' classic Psychokiller: \"\"You start a conversation; you can't even finish it. You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything. When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed\" ..... ...the enduring impression that is likely to remain is that the ECB is out of policy ammunition, and that Draghi's activism is no longer supported by many members of the council, who are fed up to the back to the teeth with politicians failing to use the time that ECB policy has being buying them to implement structural reforms.\" Perhaps one should the question: \"Draghi dead; OMT dead?\", especially given the IMF admissions overnight on the first Greek bail-out? [end] And here's some more reaction: Draghi ended his press conference with a pop at Europe's weaker countries, and their need for reform (following a question from a Spanish journalist). Why, he asks, did these nations rely on \"protected industries\" for growth during the \"fairytale times\" of the last decade? They must reshape their economies and become truly competitive. And that's that. Reaction to follow. Mario Draghi has refused to admit that the European Central Bank made any mistakes over the Greek bailout of 2010, echoing the defiant attitude of the European Commission earlier today (see 11.56am onwards). He argues that we should look at the progress made in Greece, rather than any imperfections that occured in the past. Let's look at the present, he says. \"Greece has undertaken an extraordinary adjustment\", and that progress must be acknowledged. Remarkably, Draghi says that he's pleased that the ECB is not criticised in the IMF's report, which he then admits he's not actually read yet. But once he gets round to it, he expects that the report is really based on hindsight. Nothing to worry about. Or in his words: But often these mea cuplas are a mistake of historical projection. You judge things that happen yesterday with today's eyes.... It's very hard to give judgements on events taken four years ago. Next question -- is Draghi worried about deflation, and does the ECB have any mistakes to own up to on Greece following the IMF report? Draghi mutters \"well, not really\", before explaining about deflation: He replies that most of the recent drop in inflation has been due to falling energy costs. Core inflation has moved less dramatically. He adds that deflation means a wide-ranging drop in prices across an economy -- there is no sign of that in the eurozone, he insists Draghi has now embarking on long answers about how conditions in the eurozone are slowly improving -- citing the steady decline in excess liquidity (as banks repay their emergency ECB loans), and high stock markets (!). Things are getting better, he says, but it's a question of time. No reason for the ECB to announce new measures today. Not a terribly impressive performance..... Draghi also railed against complacency in Europe, saying peripheral members must push on and introduce reforms now while conditions are calm. They shouldn't take today's market levels for granted. Draghi is fielding questions over next week's German constitutional court hearing into the legality of his OMT bond-buying programme. Draghi begins by hailing his own idea, saying it is \"very hard\" not to believe that OMT has been \"the most successful monetary policy of recent time.\" He points to the way bond yields fell since last summer, when he first promised to do 'whatever it takes' to save the euro. Draghi then says he has \"complete confidence\" in the German court when it considers the case, which has been brought by the country's Bundesbank. Intruigingly, Draghi himself will not be testifying. That honour has been passed to Jorg Asmussen, Germany's representative on the ECB (!). Asmussen's knowledge of German law makes him the best representative, Draghi smiles. But given the case pits the ECB against the Bundestag, it can't be a happy assignment for Asmussen. FINALLY, a question for Mario Draghi about the capital controls imposed in Cyprus back in March, from the FT's Michael Steen. What does Draghi feel about such restrictions being imposed, and how would be feel about seeing them in another country? Draghi replies that such controls \"profoundly distort\" markets in the eurozone, and should be lifted as soon as possible. However, the issue does not fall within the ECB's 'competence', he points out. This is the first time that the Cyprus bailout has been raised at an ECB press conference. Was the decision unanimous? Apparently no. Draghi says there was consensus on today's decisions, and adds that there has been too much dramatisation over the ECB's decision making. Disagreement is good, he says. Interesting: Draghi reveals that the ECB's governing council is \"reflecting on issuing forward guidance\" on its monetary policy. He points out, though, that the Bank has already pledged to keep running its liquidity programmes until at least next summer -- that's guidance. Draghi moves onto the issue of structural reforms, and the eurozone's jobs crisis. The ECB president said that the failure to restructure the eurozone labour markets meant that the burden was falling on the shoulders of the young. Governments must fix these weaknesses, he adds, as Draghi returned to a familiar theme. He points out that a \"a fast-changing world\" means people must develop new skills, which means investing in human capital. Questions -- has the ECB rowed back on its plans to help small firms get credit? Draghi replies by saying the ECB considered several new measures to help the economy, including bringing in negative interest rates on bank deposits. He casually drops in that the ECB is \"now technically ready\" to impose negative rates, but isn't planning to bring it in yet (citing the unintended consequences of forcing banks to pay to leave money with their central bank). There is no reason to act right now.... we keep these non-standard measures on the shelf. Draghi then says the ECB had a full discussion on recent data - some good, not so good -- before concluding that it will continue to monitor all developments before deciding whether to act. Draghi's statement should be online shortly.... Draghi concludes his statement by reiterating that eurozone governments should not 'unravel' their progress on deficit reduction programmes. He adds that the ECB believes that countries should only be given extensions to hit their deficit targets \"in exceptional circumstances\" (last week, the EC handed extensions to France, Spain, and four other countries, and also spared Belgium a fine over its failure to bring down its deficit). The ECB has also cut its inflation forecast for this year, slightly, reflecting lower oil prices. The ECB has 'marginly' revised down its growth forecast for this year, Draghi says, but has also 'marginly' raised next year's forecast. The governing council still sees downside risks for the European economy next year, though, he adds. Draghi starts by reading out his statement as usual, noting that there hav been \"significant improvement in financial markets\" since the middle of 2012. He remains confident that the conditions are in place for a gradual economic recovery later this year. The ECB will remain accomodative for as long as needed, he adds. However, labour markets remain weak, he adds. Mario Draghi's press conference is starting now: it's being streamed here. Quick piece of US economic news -- the number of people filing a new claim for unemployment dropped by 11,000 last week. Mario Draghi is about to hold a press conference in Frankfurt to explain why the ECB left interest rates unchanged at today's meeting. The financial world will be looking to see if the decision was unanimous, and whether the ECB considered bringing in negative interest rates on bank deposits, among other issues: Surely the IMF's Greek paper will get a mention too?.... The IMF criticism and the commission\u2019s defence of its performance boil down to a dispute over whether Greece\u2019s staggering debt level should have been restructured early in 2010, when the troika was fixing the terms for the bailout. From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor explains: While the IMF takes the view now that it was a cardinal error not to restructure, the commission argues strongly that there were too many unknowns, the risks were huge, such a move could have unleashed a rollercoaster of panic across the eurozone, and there was not yet any real eurozone firewall or bail-out funds in place. \u201cEven assuming it was inevitable and the only solution, the risks associated with an early Greek debt restructuring were huge,\u201d according to Commission thinking. \u201cThe whirlpool in the financial markets in early 2010 was only beginning to subside, the banking system was extremely fragile and it was not possible to estimate financial and psychological effects of the largest bond restructuring in history or its potential ripples to the real economy of the euro area. Against this background, later restructuring allowed for time to build firewall capacity. \u201cAn earlier restructuring would have also entailed risks of systemic contagion.\u201d No change at the ECB. It voted to leave its benchmark rate at the current record low of 0.5%. The deposit rate (paid by the ECB on bank deposits) remained at zero. No negative rates today. It also maintained its marginal lending rate (how much it charges banks who want to borrow overnight) at 1% Sharon Bowles, chair of the European Parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, has called for a review of the Troika system in the light of the International Monetary Fund's report. Bowles, a Liberal Democrat MEP, pointed out that the IMF has made mistakes before without learning the lessons. More democraticac accountability is needed to keep the Fund in line. Here's her full statement: It is all well and good of the IMF to admit that mistakes have been made. But the real question is whether lessons have been learnt. The IMF was equally critical of the handling of the Asian crisis as it was on Greece. Cyprus was not handled efficiently either. So, are lessons really being learned? It is clear that the Troika needs to be rethought. For example, it needs to be more coordinated in its work and able to take more time to take decisions when conflicting models emerge. It also needs to factor in the preservation of the single market into its decisions. Since Greece the workings of the Troika have obviously not improved, as the case of Cyprus clearly shows. There, the IMF put its own preferences before the country's economic sustainability. The Troika will also need to become more democratically accountable, above all else to the European Parliament. It is not possible that decisions which strike at the very heart of a country continue to be taken without the proper level of accountability. The first step on this course would be for the IMF to appear in public during hearings with the EP and not in camera. The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rate unchanged, and made no increase to its quantitative easing programme, at Sir Mervyn King's final meeting. The European Commission has rejected criticism over the 2010 Greek bailout, at a combative press briefing in Brussels. Spokesman Simon O'Connor strongly refuted the suggestion that the EC had anything to apologise for. Instead, he claimed, the strategy used in Greece remained valid today. O'Connor told reporters that the EC disagreed with the IMF's conclusion that it would have been better, with hindsight, to have implemented a debt restucturing in 2010 rather than 2011. Greek debt writeoffs then would have been highly damaging, he insisted. He also pointed out, as the IMF did its report, that the bailout programme has succeeded in keeping Greece in the euro. Under questioning by our Europe editor Ian Traynor, O'Connor argued that factors beyond the EC's control had caused Greece's plan to veer off track. One or two things happened in the intervening years that were highly damaging... there was speculation over a Greek exit from the euro area which created a much more unstable environment. O'Connor added that the EC, and its partners, had faced an unprecented situation in Greece. The assembled journlists, though, appeared unimpressed. The Telegraph's Bruno Waterfield suggested that at a more democratically accounable institution someone senior would have resigned. Here's how the press pack reacted: Martin Koehring, European analyst for The Economist Intelligence Unit, reckons the IMF's admission of mistakes over Greece is designed to put more pressure on European governments to provide more debt relief to Greece. Should that not be forthcoming, the IMF could walk away, he suggests: The IMF has admitted that it underestimated the impact of austerity on the Greek economy and the country's debt sustainability. In our opinion, this is the IMF's latest attempt to put pressure on its European partners in the bail-out programme to provide more debt relief to Greece, in order to reduce Greek public debt to substantially below 110% of GDP by 2022 (from around 175% of GDP this year); this is the IMF's target to achieve debt sustainability in Greece. There is also a risk that the IMF is positioning itself to withdraw from the rescue programme altogether, especially if euro zone debt relief is not forthcoming. The IMF has already bent its own rules so that it could continue lending to Greece; the IMF normally only lends to a country if its debt sustainability is guaranteed for at least one year out. Moreover, the size of the IMF's support to Greece (amounting to 2,159% of Greece's quota in the Fund) has also raised concerns within the Fund. Koehring adds that the Greek government may use the IMF report as a bargaining tool in its negotiations with the troika in order to ease the austerity programme, by cutting sales taxes or delaying (again) its public-sector layoff plan. Just in: German factory orders slumped unexpectedly in April, casting doubt on the theory that Germany's manufacturing base is bouncing back from its winter blues. Industrial orders fell by 2.3% in April \u2013 the biggest monthly fall since last November. It was driven by a drop in demand for large machinery, cancelling out stronger consumer demand. On a brighter note, the German finance ministry did also revise up its figures for March, to a 2.3% rise (from 0.1%). But April's data was still a disappointment, and included a 3.6% drop in orders from the eurozone. Here's how the figures break down: \u2022 Capital goods: -3.6% (domestic -3.2%, foreign -4.0%); \u2022 Consumer goods: +7.5%, \u2022 Intermediate goods: -1.9% And here's some early reaction: The impact of the Greek austerity programme is clearly visible in today's unemployment data, which shows the jobless rate rose again in March. Another 4,626 people lost their jobs during the month, pushing the total out of work to 1,309,071, or 26.8% of the working population - up from 26.7% the previous month. But there is a glimmer of good news - February's figure was revised down from 27%. And this graph suggests the surge in unemployment may be bottoming out (at levels worthy of a depression) On a seasonally-unadjusted basis, the number of people in work actually rose in March in Greece, to 3,580,680. However, another 3,379,478 people were classed as 'inactive', so didn't crop up in the headline jobless rate. That means more people are inactive and unemployed than actually in work in Greece. And last night's IMF report shows that the Troika expected Greece's unemployment rate to be just 15% in 2012, not 25%. As it admitted: The recession has been deep with exceptionally high unemployment. The [bailout] program did not restore growth and regain market access as it had set out to. And here's the new Greek Labour Force Survey. The Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras has just welcomed the IMF's report into the 2010 bailout, in an interview with our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith. Stournaras says the controversial IMF report has added to his optimism that the country's debt-stricken economy will recover. Stournaras said: I am optimistic. It is a good report and it helps Greece It is a good piece of self-criticism. It is an objective report reporting mistakes made by the international community and by Greece. Stournaras added that his optimism is partly based on the Washington-based organisation's prognosis that Greece \"will not need further [budget cutting] measures in 2013-14.\" It also emerged this morning that Stournaras, a professor of economics, actually played a role in compiling the report. Back in 2010, he was head of the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE) in Athens, and was repeatedly asked about the weaknesses of the Greece's first \u20ac110bn EU-IMF bailout. According to Ta Nea, the Greek newspaper, Stournaras says he told the Fund\u2019s technical team at the time that the programme was wrong to prioritise deficit reduction, rather than not structural reforms. Helena adds: Commentators this morning have not forgotten that Greece\u2019s \u201cunsustainable\u201d debt load started out at \u20ac310bn euro back in 2010 and is \u2026.. \u20ac310bn euro today. In the interim, the country has been plunged into recession, spiralling unemployment (at 27 % the worst in the euro zone) , with plummetting living standards and the closure of hundreds of thousands of businesses. The IMF's failure to accurately predict the full impact of Greece's austerity programme meant that its economic forecasts for Greece were wildly off-beam, points out Gabriel Sterne, economist at Exotix: Stock broker Dan Davies, though, suggests that the political infighting in Greece made it impossible for the IMF to do much better in 2010: While Sony Kapoor of the Redefine thinktank argues that the European Union and the ECB were more culpable: Confirmation this morning that France's labour market is weakening. The French unemployment rate hit 10.8% in the first quarter of this year, meaning it has risen steadily for the last two years. That's up from 10.5% at the end of 2012, according to the Insee agency, and a new 14-year high. The Greek report included some criticism of the way the 'Troika' \u2013 officials from the IMF, the ECB and the EU \u2013 worked together during the crisis. It found that they struggled to 'gel', and that there was no clear division of labour: Here's a highlight: The Troika partners listened to each other and were well-prepared. However, detailed conditionality increased the coordination challenge. There was also sometimes a lack of continuity in the Troika teams. All-in-all, this exacerbated uncertainty and reduced the possibility for early agreements. Draghi didn't work at the ECB in 2010 when the first Geek bailout was agreed - his views on the Bank's performance then could be interesting.... The IMF's 50-page report into the 2010 Greece bailout, and the mistakes that were made along the way, is online here: EX POST EVALUATION OF EXCEPTIONAL ACCESS UNDER THE 2010 STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT. Here's AP's take on the ECB's governing council meeting today: The European Central Bank is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent on Thursday even though there's still a recession in the 17 countries that use the euro. The ECB cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point in May and analysts say it will probably hold off at its meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, while it assesses how the economy is doing. Some do not rule out a surprise cut to stimulate the eurozone economy. The ECB is looking at different ways to get growth started. President Mario Draghi has said it is talking to other European Union officials about ways to encourage banks to lend more to small companies but it is not clear when a proposal might be ready. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events in the eurozone and the global economy. It's Central Banks day, with the ECB and the Bank of England both meeting to set monetary policy. Neither Bank is expected to change their headline interest rates, but the ECB's press conference (from 1.30pm BST) will be closely watched. Mario Draghi could reveal details of new measures to help small firms access credit, or indicate if the ECB is closer to imposing negative interest rates on eurozone bank deposits to force them to lend more. In London, it'll be Sir Mervyn King's last ever Monetary Policy Committee meeting. There's little chance, though, that the MPC will give Merv the \u00a325bn of quantitative easing he's been calling for. The BoE decision comes at noon BST. The other main event today could be the fallout from the International Monetary Fund's 'mea culpa' over its Greek bailout. I covered the release of the report in yesterday's blog (from 9pm), but to get newcomers up to speed, here's our news story from last night: The International Monetary Fund admitted it had failed to realise the damage austerity would do to Greece as the Washington-based organisation catalogued mistakes made during the bailout of the stricken eurozone country. In an assessment of the rescue conducted jointly with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European commission, the IMF said it had been forced to override its normal rules for providing financial assistance in order to put money into Greece. Fund officials had severe doubts about whether Greece's debt would be sustainable even after the first bailout was provided in May 2010 and only agreed to the plan because of fears of contagion. While it succeeded in keeping Greece in the eurozone, the report admitted the bailout included notable failures. \"Market confidence was not restored, the banking system lost 30% of its deposits and the economy encountered a much deeper than expected recession with exceptionally high unemployment.\" More here: IMF admits: we failed to realise the damage austerity would do to Greece The report suggested that it would have been better to have agreed a debt reduction plan for Greece back in 2010, rather than letting the issue fester until 2011. it was also critical of European politicians who fuelled the crisis by speculating Greece could leave the euro, saying they had made the situation even worse. I'll cover the fallout from the report, and other events, through the day.....",

Foxtons founder Jon Hunt sold his agency to BC Partners for \u00a3360m in 2007. But the company struggled through the subsequent financial crisis and was taken over by its banks when it failed to repay its debts. BC Partners has since admitted that the ill-timed buyout was a \"mistake\" and partners at the private equity firm are said to have referred to the estate agency as the \"F-word\". But BC went back for more, taking control of the group for the second time last year, when it bought the remaining stakes in Foxtons back from the banks. It is expecting to make nearly double its equity investment in the group, which no longer has any debt. Foxtons has been lifted by the recovery in the London housing market over the past three years, doubling its pre-tax profits in 2010 to \u00a335.4m \u2013 a figure that held steady in 2011, according to filings at Companies House. BC is said to have appointed Credit Suisse, Canaccord Genuity, and Numis Securities to manage the share offering, but it is thought that the private equity firm could ultimately opt for a sale of the business.

      "bodyText": "The European commission on Thursday strongly defended its handling of the Greek crisis after the withering criticism in a report by the International Monetary Fund. Simon O'Connor, spokesman for Olli Rehn, the commissioner handling the \u20ac73bn 2010 bailout, said Brussels \"fundamentally disagreed\" with the IMF on two of the central points raised by the Washington institution \u2013 that Greece's debt should have been restructured at the very outset of the crisis and that the commission failed to do enough about structural reforms in Greece. Early debt restructuring, said O'Connor, could have triggered \"systemic contagion\" across the eurozone. On structural reforms, he added, \"this is plainly wrong and unfounded.\" In an internal report released on Wednesday evening, the IMF conceded that a catalogue of blunders had been made in the dealings with Greece by the \"troika\" of officials from the IMF, the commission and the European Central Bank. The report accused the Europeans of being inexperienced and amateur in their approach. But the IMF's findings were swept aside by the ECB's president Mario Draghi on Thursday afternoon. Draghi told reporters he had not read the report, but was confident that any criticism were based on hindsight. \"Often these mea culpas are a mistake of historical projection. You judge things that happen yesterday with today's eyes,\" said Draghi. O'Connor, though, conceded that \"lessons have been learned\" from the chastening experience. \"Of course, looking back we see what might have been done differently,\" he said, without highlighting where changes could or should have been effected. \"This is a learning process.\" Unlike the IMF report, there was no criticism from the commission of its own performance, although O'Connor said that a \"full report\" into the work of the troika over the past three years was being prepared. He did not say when it would be published. He also emphasised that the IMF criticism was contained in an internal IMF staff document and did not represent the official position of the IMF board. In Athens, though, the IMF's admission was welcomed by finance minister Yannis Stournaras. He told the Guardian that the \"good report\" would help Greece to recover from the trauma of recent years. \"It is a good piece of self-criticism. It is an objective report reporting mistakes made by the international community and by Greece,\" Stournaras said. IMF and commission at odds over debt restructuring The IMF's criticism and the commission's defence of its performance boil down to a dispute disagreed over whether Greece's staggering debt level should have been restructured early in 2010 when the troika was fixing the terms for the bailout. While the IMF takes the view now that it was a cardinal error not to restructure, the commission argues strongly that there were too many unknowns, the risks were huge, such a move could have unleashed a rollercoaster of panic across the eurozone, and there was not yet any real eurozone firewall or bailout funds in place. \"Even assuming it was inevitable and the only solution, the risks associated with an early Greek debt restructuring were huge,\" said the commission. \"The whirlpool in the financial markets in early 2010 was only beginning to subside, the banking system was extremely fragile and it was not possible to estimate financial and psychological effects of the largest bond restructuring in history or its potential ripples to the real economy of the euro area. Against this background, later restructuring allowed for time to build firewall capacity. An earlier restructuring would have also entailed risks of systemic contagion.\" 50-page report released The IMF's report, running to 50 pages (pdf), revealed that the Fund lowered its own standards for debt sustainability to keep Greece's bailout within its rules. It also admitted underestimating the full impact of austerity on the Greek economy, As the report put it: \"Market confidence was not restored, the banking system lost 30% of its deposits and the economy encountered a much deeper than expected recession with exceptionally high unemployment.\" The 2010 bailout was followed by the second rescue package in 2011 in which private sector creditors agreed to write off a \u20ac106bn chunk of Greece's \u20ac356bn debt pile. Martin Koehring, European analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit, believes the IMF is looking to put pressure on European governments to agree another haircut. \"There is also a risk that the IMF is positioning itself to withdraw from the rescue programme altogether, especially if eurozone debt relief is not forthcoming,\" Koehring added. Sharon Bowles, chair of the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, said the IMF needs to learn the lessons from Greece, having also made mistakes over Cyprus's rescue this year. Fund officials should also be quizzed in public, she argued. \"The troika will also need to become more democratically accountable, above all else to the European parliament. It is not possible that decisions which strike at the very heart of a country continue to be taken without the proper level of accountability,\" Bowles said.",

The decision threatens 600 jobs at Eurotunnel's Myferrylink venture \u2013 including 100 at Dover \u2013 and could hit passenger demand at the height of the booking season. Eurotunnel said it would appeal the ruling, which it branded \"incomprehensible and seriously disproportionate\". The Euronext-listed company runs roll-on/roll-off train services through the tunnel \u2013 shuttling trucks, cars and coaches under the Channel \u2013 and captured 46% of the traffic between Dover and Calais in 2012. In addition, it bought three ferries from the wreckage of the bankrupt SeaFrance last year to launch Myferrylink in August, prompting the Competition Commission investigation. The company will continue to operate the ferries until the resolution of its appeal. In its final 134-page report, the Competition Commission said the ferry service gave Eurotunnel more than half the cross-Channel market, which could lead to higher prices for both passengers and freight customers. It said Eurotunnel bought the ships to stop ferry operator DFDS from buying them and is concerned that if it takes no action DFDS could exit the market, leaving Eurotunnel with an even larger market share. Alasdair Smith, deputy chairman of the commission, said: \"It cannot be good for competition when Eurotunnel, which already holds a market share of over 40%, moves into the ferry business \u2013 particularly when it did so to stop a competitor from buying the ferries.\" Eurotunnel hit back saying the decision \"was not based on any concrete facts, but solely upon a random association of virtual hypothesis\". It argues that the ban would leave just P&amp;O and DFDS offering ferry services across the Channel, which would reduce competition. Jacques Gounon, chairman and chief executive of Eurotunnel, said: \"This decision by the Competition Commission will reduce the choice of services across the strait of Dover to the detriment of the consumer. It will inevitably lead to an increase in the price of a crossing.\" The commission said it would not impose the ban immediately but would give Eurotunnel a limited period to sell its two largest ferries, as a means of solving the competition problem. That would require clearance from the French commercial court, which ruled at the time of the purchase that the ferries could not be resold for five years, in order to provide stability for employees. Eurotunnel bought three of SeaFrance's four ferries for \u20ac60m (\u00a352m), after the company collapsed into liquidation in November 2011.",

And while laws are in place on both sides of the Atlantic to give them limited and officially authorised access to this material, Thursday's Guardian story reveals the ambition of the National Security Agency (NSA) to use a secretive legal process to pick up information on a much wider scale. This will worry privacy campaigners, who will doubtless wonder whether the UK's covert intelligence gathering agencies, MI5, MI6, and GCHQ, have ever sought such access in Britain. If they have, neither the agencies nor the companies have ever admitted it \u2013 or would ever want to. Nevertheless, the tools to engineer such a disclosure in the UK seem to exist, under the provisions of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa). Ripa was introduced to give a framework for the \"lawful interception of communications, access to communications data, surveillance and the use of covert human intelligence sources (undercover agents)\" at a time when laws in this area either did not exist, or had become outdated \u2013 a criticism now laid at Ripa, which has struggled to make sense of an ever-changing technological landscape. The justifications for authorising the interception of material through Ripa included the interests of national security, detecting serious crime and safeguarding economic wellbeing. The act also set up a grading system; basic intercepts required a certain level of clearance, such as a senior Whitehall official or a senior police officer; the most sensitive intercepts would have to be approved by the home secretary. And it is to the home secretary that British intelligence agencies would have to look if they wanted to obtain the phone records of millions of people in the UK, even for a limited period, in the way the White House has managed on behalf of the NSA. Section 12 of Ripa makes clear that telecoms companies must have in place ways to provide law enforcement bodies with immediate access to information that might be required in a crisis. These \"back-door\" entrances are well-established, and the relationships between the agencies and the firms themselves are well-cultivated to ensure the smooth osmosis of material at critical times.

The last annual report of the interception of communications commissioner, who scrutinises the way Ripa is used, praised GCHQ in particular, saying staff conducted themselves with the \"highest levels of integrity and legal compliance\". Ripa was clearly not drafted to allow agencies unfettered access to material, and its limitations are one reason why the Tories have been trying to enhance the surveillance capabilities of UK agencies.

Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, will introduce the Regulation of Wholesale Energy Markets and Transparency (REMIT) legislation to parliament just weeks after a dawn raid on major oil companies. The government will stress that the energy regulator, Ofgem, will be given sweeping powers to inspect premises, seize data and levy much higher financial penalties under REMIT. The European Commission is also keen to introduce a system whereby companies will be forced to report details about their buying and selling of oil, gas and power when it is done over-the-counter. There is increasing concern following the Libor scandal that rocked the banking world that the relatively unregulated energy markets are open to similar abuse by financial institutions and energy companies, which regularly use them for speculation as well as for meeting actual need. Those fears were heightened when a whistleblower working for one of the price reporting agencies, ICIS-Heren, claimed to have seen attempts by unscrupulous traders to submit false data to the price reporting agency. That triggered a probe by Ofgem and what was then called the Financial Services Authority, now the Financial Conduct Authority. The concerns were compounded last month when the competition authorities inside the EC launched raids on oil companies BP, Statoil, Shell and another price reporting agency, Platts. Earlier concerns about the price reporting agencies and the oil markets were raised in a report published last year by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), an association of organisations that regulate the world's securities and futures markets. Before Christmas, the French oil group Total said in an explosive letter to IOSCO: \"Sometimes the criteria imposed by PRAs do not assure an accurate representation of the market and consequently deform the real price levels paid at every level of the price chain, including by the consumer.\" The UK government has been slow to introduce REMIT, in view of the deadline given by Brussels to introduce the regulations is the end of this month.",
