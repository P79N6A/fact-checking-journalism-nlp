      "bodyText": "The rise of contract and casual work means a shorter working week and universal basic income should become serious policy options, the Green Institute says. The institute\u2019s report Can Less Work be More Fair? said the loss of permanent full-time jobs in areas as diverse as cleaning services and academia was making work highly precarious and increasing the divide between those who were overworked and those who were underemployed. Tim Hollo, the Green Institute\u2019s executive director, said he hoped the paper expanded the acceptable boundary of conversation for left-of-centre politics, as the Institute of Public Affairs and Sky\u2019s Andrew Bolt did for free-market and right-wing politics. He said the Green Institute \u201cunambiguously\u201d supported reducing working hours with no reduction in working conditions by exploiting technology to share work more evenly and reduce inequality. \u201cThe Keynesian ideal of a 15-hour working week used to be uncontroversially positive. It should be again,\u201d the paper says. \u201cWe need to reclaim the idea that, while work is important, while we should all contribute our abilities, ideas and skills, a prosperous society should not force the majority of its people to work immensely long hours in order to scrape by.\u201d The institute said it remained agnostic on whether universal basic income (UBI) \u2013 which would provide every resident with a regular and unconditional subsistence wage \u2013 would be appropriate in Australia. \u201cHowever, we believe a conversation on the idea, in the context of the need to grapple with the inevitability of less and less paid work in an ever more unstable world, is vital to our politics,\u201d he said. The paper\u2019s contributors include left-of-centre economists and academics Jon Altman, Eva Cox, Elise Klein, Greg Marston, Godfrey Moase, Clare Ozich, Frank Stilwell, Louise Tarrant and Chris Twomey. Klein, from the University of Melbourne, wrote that the idea of a universal basic income stretched back to Thomas More\u2019s Utopia in 1516, and was carried by thinkers such as Thomas Paine, John Stuart Mill and Bertrand Russell. Ben Spies-Butcher, from Macquarie University, said it could be part of a broader drive for social change, even though working for more affordable housing and better provision of universal health and education might be more important. Frank Stilwell, emeritus professor from the political economy department at Sydney University, argued UBI would need to be examined in greater detail before being considered for introduction in Australia. Hollo wrote: \u201cWe hope that this paper can contribute in its own small way to an open, honest conversation in our politics, media and society about how to make a future with less paid work a more fair, more connected, more caring future.\u201d The Green Institute is the Greens\u2019 equivalent of the Liberal party\u2019s Menzies Research Centre and Labor\u2019s Chifley Institute. It receives federal funding, but its work is published independently of the Greens party hierarchy. According to the 2016-17 budget, the Green Institute received $84,000 in funding this year, rising to $92,000 by 2019-20. By comparison, the Menzies Research Centre and Chifley Research Centre each received $228,000 in 2016-17.",

All angrily denied receiving any special treatment. They have all done something else too: they have strengthened operations in the UK. Starbucks has switched head office activities from the Netherlands and Fiat Chrysler, created by a merger in 2014, has made London its headquarters. Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple have unveiled plans for gleaming new offices in the UK capital. On Thursday, McDonald\u2019s joined in. It is unwinding a controversial $1bn (\u00a3800m) royalties-earning business in Luxembourg, replacing it with a new European holding company run out of the UK. The message is clear. If you\u2019re a multinational feeling the heat from tax officials in mainland Europe, Britain can offer a port in the storm. Google, the bete noir of many European tax justice campaigners, has felt the allure too. After a pleasing resolution of a longstanding dispute over its UK taxes in January, the online search group recently resurrected plans for vast new offices in London. While tax inspectors in Italy, France, Spain and Germany launch raids on the offices of many of the world\u2019s largest multinationals, in Britain there is no such unpleasantness. Big businesses appreciate being greeted instead by someone from HMRC called a \u201ccustomer relationship manager\u201d. Like a consummate hotelier, Britain calculates that by showing just a little more hospitality than its European neighbours, all the guests will want to stay here instead. This is not to say experts are wrong when they predict many multinationals will freeze UK investment, or pull out altogether, as the country prepares to exit the European Union. That may be true for many businesses in industries heavily dependent on pan-European regulation. But for others, an independent Britain is an appealing prospect. Ultimately, all major international investment decisions boil down to a simple bargain. What can a host country do for a multinational, and what must the multinational offer in return? As it slides towards Brexit, Britain is less equipped than ever to impose tough terms on the world\u2019s largest corporations. It may be attracting some big-name investors, but at what cost to the British taxpayer?",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s final salary pension funds have slashed their ownership of stock-market listed companies to just 7% of their total holdings following a huge shift in recent years to overseas stock markets and government bonds. The move away from owning UK stocks emphasises how dependent Britain\u2019s estimated 13.5 million past and present final salary scheme members have become on returns from shares in US, continental and emerging market companies to generate a retirement income. The rapidly ageing membership of Britain\u2019s guaranteed, defined benefit pension schemes has also forced a huge shift into government bonds as scheme trustees attempt to reduce the risk of their fund becoming insolvent. According to the annual pension fund health check by the Pension Protection Fund, the 5,794 UK defined benefit pension schemes faced a \u00a3780bn deficit at the end of March 2016, little changed on the year before. A combination of falling global share prices and a slump in the interest paid on government bonds offset a flood of special contributions by employers that cost \u00a310.5bn in the first half of 2016. The number of active scheme members fell below 1.5 million for the first time, the PPF said, increasing the number of deferred members with a frozen guaranteed payout. German car giant BMW became the latest firm to propose shutting its final-salary pension schemes when it said in September that it would shift the 5,000 staff at its plants in the UK over to its less generous defined-contribution scheme. Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said the \u00a3780bn deficit was \u201cstaggering\u201d and revealed the uphill task faced by employers in meeting their obligations to employees. He said the change in the composition of investments also illustrated how the relationship between employers and the UK pension system had changed significantly in the past 10 years. \u201cPension schemes used to be owners of UK companies as well as being funded by them. Now, the bulk of scheme assets are invested overseas or in bonds. What\u2019s more, as schemes mature, they will increasingly become net sellers of assets. \u201cPensions being used to help finance the growth in British companies is becoming a thing of the past; instead our savings are either being lent to the government or invested abroad.\u201d The PPF, which was set up as an industry-backed lifeboat fund for crashed schemes, said the proportion of overseas-quoted shares in equity holdings increased from 65.4% to 68.6%. The share of bonds in scheme portfolios rose from 47.7% to 51.3%. Andrew McKinnon, the PPF\u2019s chief financial officer, said: \u201cWhile scheme funding remained largely stable in the year to March, there have been large swings in funding since June. \u201cWhen we look back at what progress schemes have made over the last decade it appears that many schemes are just treading water. The average recovery plan length, at around eight years, has barely improved, which brings home the challenge we now face. \u201cThe current economic backdrop, as well as scrutiny faced by the entire industry, suggests conditions will remain tough in 2017.\u201d",

Let\u2019s hope chief executive Andy Parker uses plainer language, rather than management blurb, when he explains to affected staff in call-centres why they are being replaced by machines. Mind you, Parker\u2019s hold on his own position looks less than secure. His worry is not a robot but Ian Powell, a big cheese out of PwC, who arrives as chairman in January. In the five months since Powell\u2019s appointment was announced, Capita has blown its status as the star turn of the outsourcing sector. Thursday\u2019s profit warning was the second in three months. The shares are down 60% this year and stand at a 10-year low. Any incoming chairman would want to know if this catastrophe for shareholders could have been avoided. The case for the defence is that Capita has suffered a series of unfortunate accidents, such as a Brexit-related slowdown, delays in installing IT for the London congestion zone and upheaval in a recruitment business. Add them all up, though, and Capita, even on the latest prediction, will still make pre-tax profits this year of \u00a3515m, only about \u00a3100m less than expected in the summer. The shortfall has done so much damage to the share price only because Capita was running with too much debt. Borrowings are approaching 2.9 times top-line profits, well beyond the company\u2019s definition of a prudent cap. A slowdown in spending by clients made the ratios balloon. It looks as if the company believed its own hype about the predictable nature of its revenues. If so, that could have been avoided. Parker\u2019s solution is to sell Capita Asset Services, a registrar business that also serves the fund-management industry. If the division fetches \u00a3700m, debt ratios will look healthier and Parker may achieve his primary goal of avoiding a dividend cut. Yet you can understand why investors are rattled. Capita Asset Services used to be seen as a prized business but has suddenly been declared \u201cnon-core\u201d. Meanwhile a second profits warning within three months suggests Capita\u2019s ability to read its own markets is not what it once was. Powell\u2019s verdict is keenly awaited. Sports Direct\u2019s Hellawell should get out of the spotlight Morale of staff at Sports Direct has suffered, says chairman Keith Hellawell, but here\u2019s news to cheer them up: profits have halved but the company can still afford to buy a \u00a340m corporate jet. Employees can even hire it themselves \u2013 if they pay \u201copen market rates\u201d, which may deter 99% of the workforce. But the arrangement that will infuriate outside shareholders is surely the deal whereby Sports Direct will buy cosmetics \u2013 under that must-have brand Sport FX \u2013 from a company where founder Mike Ashley\u2019s 20-year-old daughter, Matilda, is a director. Matilda\u2019s outfit is called Double Take, which is probably what shareholders did. Yes, Sports Direct really has responded to accusations that it is run as a personal fiefdom by doing this deal (other arrangements involve Ashley\u2019s brother and the boyfriend of Ashley\u2019s other daughter). Ashley, it seems, doesn\u2019t care what outsider investors say. Hellawell, though, is jolly angry about the \u201cextreme campaign\u201d that has been \u201cwaged\u201d against Sports Direct by the media, politicians and trade unions: \u201cI begin to question whether this intense scrutiny is all ethically motivated.\u201d Unfortunately, the former chief constable of West Yorkshire didn\u2019t say what conclusions he has reached. Here are a few facts to help his inquiries. This paper\u2019s expos\u00e9 of working conditions at the Shirebrook warehouse was honoured at the British Journalism awards this week. The business select committee\u2019s report was a cross-party affair and supported the thrust of the complaints made by Unite, the trade union, for many years. Sports Direct workers have been awarded \u00a31m in back pay as a result of the scrutiny. The company itself has acknowledged \u201cshortcomings\u201d and pledged to do better. No doubt, life in the spotlight is uncomfortable. But there is a simple remedy, at least for Hellawell. After seven years in the job, and having failed to spot a crisis that was brewing for ages, he could resign. That was the wish of a majority of outside shareholders at September\u2019s annual meeting. Ashley, with his 53% stake, saved his chairman but it remains hard to see how Sports Direct can genuinely claim to have turned a corner while Hellawell remains in post, raging impotently about scrutiny that would be applied to any high-profile public company.",

      "bodyText": "A British outsourcing company whose contracts include collecting the BBC licence fee is to replace staff with robots as it slashes costs. Capita, a FTSE 100-listed firm that also runs the London congestion charge, said it needed to axe 2,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive in response to poor trading. It said it would use the money it saved from sacking thousands of staff to fund investment in automated technology across all of the company\u2019s divisions. The announcement will fuel growing fears that human workers will have to make way for robots, as companies turn to technology to boost profits. The Apple and Samsung supplier Foxconn was reported to have replaced 60,000 workers with robots earlier this year, while the former chief executive of McDonald\u2019s suggested a similar tactic in response to low-paid workers\u2019 demands for better pay and conditions. In a gloomy statement that sent its shares to a 10-year low at one stage, Capita said it had been hit by \u201cheadwinds\u201d as its corporate clients reined in their spending. The company unveiled plans to shore up its finances, saving \u00a350m a year via austerity measures, including greater use of \u201cproprietary robotic solutions\u201d and moving around 200 jobs to India. The chief executive, Andy Parker, said Capita, which made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3186m in the first six months of this year, would use robots to help eliminate human error and make decisions faster. The company employs 78,000 people. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t remove the need for an individual but it speeds up how they work, which means you need less [sic] people to do it.\u201d He said a human assisted by automated robotic technology could do a 40-minute job in much less time. \u201cThey [human staff members] can then do 10 times the amount they used to, so you need less [sic] people to do the same amount of work.\u201d Parker said this would make the company more efficient by \u201ctaking away some of the decision-making and cutting down potential errors\u201d. Capita, which provides services ranging from electronic tagging for offenders to store card services for retailers, will also move some of its IT operation abroad. Parker said this would involve \u201ca couple of hundred\u201d jobs being shifted to India. The company\u2019s decisions on staffing are part of an attempt to reduce costs without causing shareholders any financial pain. Parker said the cost cuts \u2013 coupled with asset sales \u2013 would allow Capita to avoid reducing its annual dividend, which was worth \u00a3200m last year and \u00a3180m the year before. But despite the effort to protect investors, shares in the company finished down more than 4%, having fallen more than 14% during the day, as investors were left stunned by the company\u2019s pessimistic outlook. Parker said he \u201cwould have thought there\u2019d be a more positive reaction\u201d. Rehana Azam, the national secretary for public services at the GMB union, said: \u201cPublic services are predominantly delivered by people so it\u2019s hard to see how they\u2019re going to provide a cost-efficient service from call centres in another country. \u201cWe\u2019d want to sit down with Capita and make sure people are treated fairly in any process that ends with them losing jobs.\u201d Azam cast doubt on whether using robots to automate some of its systems would work. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a good track record with private providers delivering computerised systems. I\u2019d like to see where there have been good examples of that kind of automation.\u201d Capita has struggled as its clients, which include O2, M&amp;S, John Lewis and Dixons Carphone, have looked to cut costs in areas such as corporate travel and recruitment. The company refused to blame the Brexit vote for the disappointing update but said earlier this year that uncertainty over the UK\u2019s relationship with the European Union had hit its business, delaying key contracts. Capita is predominantly UK-based, unlike bigger rivals, such as G4S and Serco, which have been sheltered to a large degree from the Brexit-related fallout by their bigger geographical footprint.",

      "bodyText": "British drinkers have been quaffing gin in record amounts during 2016, buying 40m bottles in a spending spree that outstripped sales growth in beer and sparkling wine. Annual gin sales rose 16% to smash through the \u00a31bn barrier for the first time in the UK, leading the drink industry to declare 2016 the \u201cyear of gin\u201d. About 40m bottles were sold over the past 12 months, enough to make 1.12bn gin and tonics, or roughly 28 for every person of legal drinking age in the UK, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. This was an increase of 200m G&amp;Ts compared with 2012, signalling that gin continues to grow in popularity. A growing thirst for the spirit has also caused a surge in the number of distilleries, with about 40 opening in 2016. In 2010, there were only 116 distilleries in the UK, according to HM Revenue &amp; Customs, but about 100 have opened in the past two years alone. Brockmans, which claims to be the fastest-growing premium gin, said its sales had more than doubled in the first six months of 2016. \u201cDrinking habits have changed dramatically in the last five years and the premium gin market has been one of the biggest winners,\u201d said its founder and chief executive, Neil Everitt. \u201cThe emergence of new-style gins and premium mixers is driving sales before food, particularly in gastro pubs.\u201d He added that the weakness of sterling had boosted sales in Spain, one of the company\u2019s biggest markets. London-based distiller Sipsmith, founded in 2009 at the forefront of a wave of new distilleries, said it was proud to be part of the \u201cgin renaissance\u201d. \u201cWe launched the first copper pot gin distillery in London for nearly 200 years in 2009, tapping into the consumer desire for provenance, authenticity and ultimately quality,\u201d said founder Fairfax Hall. \u201cSince then a wave of craft distilleries has swept across the country.\u201d The WSTA also revealed that foreign drinkers are importing gin in record volumes, with exports to America particularly strong. The trade body said gin exports to the US were up 553% in the past decade, reaching \u00a3159m in 2015. It put the drink\u2019s popularity with Americans down to hit British TV shows such as Downton Abbey and films including the James Bond franchise featuring the tipple. Drinks industry experts said gin\u2019s rise was likely to continue, with drinkers likely to upgrade to more expensive brands as they develop a taste for it. Humphrey Serjeantson, research director of International Wine and Spirit Research, said: \u201cAs we see it, the gin boom is far from over; gin is set to continue its long-term repositioning from mother\u2019s ruin to exciting and dynamic category.\u201d He said growth would be driven \u201cby premium and above brands, with a wide flavour range combining with localism and, increasingly, terroir playing a key role. \u201cThis will include the growth of a real ultra-premium segment (priced at \u00a345.00 and over). WSTA chief executive Miles Beale said: \u201cThere are many reasons why people may not feel like celebrating 2016 but the WSTA are pleased to give you something happy to reflect on \u2013 2016 can now be remembered as the \u2018Great British Gin Take Off\u2019.\u201d According to the WSTA, the next fastest growing category was sparkling wine including champagne which rose 12%, ahead of beer which rose 2% and wine which fell by 1%. Overall, the wider British alcohol market rose 2% to \u00a340bn. Among wines, the WSTA identified a rise in the popularity of New Zealand and Argentinian vineyards at the expense of European and US wines. Annual sales of New Zealand wines and Argentinian wines grew, while Spanish, American, Italian and French wines all experienced more muted growth or declined in popularity. The annual survey also revealed changing tastes in the wines that people buy to drink at home. Among the reds, sales of Merlot were up 7% to \u00a3321m, while Shiraz were up 6% to \u00a3300m and Tempranillo was flat at \u00a3214m. The boom in sales of New Zealand wines helped Sauvignon Blanc lead the way among white wines, with sales up 10% to \u00a3708m. But Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay both fell out of favour, each falling by 4% to sales of just above \u00a3400m each. The WSTA said the government cut duties on spirits, which it warned would boost the industry and the Treasury\u2019s coffers. It said the cut in spirits duty in the 2015 budget had delivered a 4.1% increase in duty to \u00a3125m, adding that the UK spirit industry was \u201cone of the most heavily taxed in Europe\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Food prices will rise unless the government ensures EU citizens can work in the UK after Brexit, according to industry groups representing the major supermarkets and food manufacturers, including the owner of Marmite. The open letter to the government is signed by 30 food and drink industry bodies, including the Food and Drink Federation, which represents major suppliers, including Marmite maker Unilever and Mr Kipling owner Premier foods; the British Retail Consortium, which counts Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons among its members, and the National Farmers Union. The letter, published in the Guardian, says: \u201cWorkers from the European Union, some of whom are already leaving the UK, play a significant role in delivering affordable and high-quality food and drink.\u201d It says they provide \u201can essential reservoir of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour.\u201d Any points-based permit system for immigrants should place the food and drink supply chain on a par with financial services and the automotive sector, the industry leaders say. \u201cAll options should be explored, including a workable points-based system for shortage occupations, sector-based and seasonal/guest worker schemes and effective transitionary arrangements. If it is not, the UK will face less food choice and higher food prices.\u201d The letter, which is also signed by the heads of the British Beer &amp; Pubs Association, the British Growers Association and the British Soft Drinks Association, claims that some EU workers have already begun to leave the UK in the wake of the Brexit vote which has led to a fall in the value of the pound. \u201cThe government can address this issue directly. It should offer unambiguous reassurance to EU workers throughout our supply chain about their right to remain here,\u201d it said. Employment agencies have warned that the UK\u2019s food industry is facing the worst labour shortage for at least 12 years. The Association of Labour Providers (ALP), whose employment agency members supply 70% of the temporary labour used by the food and drink industry, recently said responses to job ads had slumped by up to 70% as workers from the EU \u2013 who account for 90% of jobs in the sector \u2013 avoid coming to the UK. The NFU has said farmers have seen a shortfall in EU workers, exacerbated by the drop in the pound against the euro, which has diminished the value of the money they are sending home. Nearly 4 million people are employed in growing, harvesting, producing, packaging, selling and serving food and drink in the UK, a large proportion of whom are EU nationals. Although food prices continue to fall amid heavy competition between the major supermarket chains and fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, rising costs are expected to drive up inflation in the coming months. A string of major food brands have sought increased cost prices from supermarkets as the fall in the pound has driven up the cost of importing ingredients and other essentials, such as packaging. Unilever, which also owns Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s and Dove; Typhoo; Birds Eye and Walkers are embroiled in an industry-wide battle over price increases caused by the 15% drop in the value of the pound against the euro and 18% against the dollar since the UK voted to leave the European Union. The lower value of the pound is also expected to increase exports, potentially making it harder for UK companies to source home-grown ingredients. For example, the price of British butter has soared 80%, partly because processors have found exporting easier. Food and drink is the UK\u2019s biggest export, worth \u00a318bn, led by Scotch whisky, chocolate, beer and salmon. Despite its relatively low profile, food manufacturing is worth more to the UK economy than the automotive and aerospace sectors combined.",

    "webTitle": "ECB surprises markets by scaling back QE programme", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has vowed to continue with its programme of electronic money printing to shore up the eurozone recovery but surprised financial markets by reducing the amount of stimulus it expects to provide each month. The single currency bloc\u2019s central bank left interest rates unchanged and said it would continue its programme of quantitative easing (QE) to next December or beyond \u201cif necessary\u201d, marking an extension to its previous guidance that the scheme would run until the end of March. However, the value of the bonds bought by the ECB per month under the QE programme will drop to \u20ac60bn (\u00a351bn) from April next year, from \u20ac80bn currently. The ECB\u2019s QE scheme involves creating electronic cash to buy sovereign and corporate debt to counter anaemic economic growth and low inflation. ECB president Mario Draghi insisted the central bank would remain ready to beef up its support for the eurozone economy as needed and rebuffed suggestions the plans for more modest bond-buying from next spring represented \u201ctapering\u201d, a process by which QE is wound down. \u201cThere is no question about tapering. Tapering has not been discussed today,\u201d he told a news conference after the latest ECB policy meeting. Draghi has previously talked about doing \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to support the currency bloc and on Thursday sought to send a similarly reassuring message. He said the policy of low rates \u2013 the ECB\u2019s main interest rate is at zero \u2013 and QE was supporting demand in the eurozone and the economy was expected to continue growing at a \u201cmoderate but firming\u201d pace. But if things took a turn for the worse, and inflation failed to pick up enough, the ECB could increase its bond-buying again and/or extend the scheme, he added. The ECB\u2019s own inflation outlook suggested such moves to increase bond-buying could well be warranted. It is forecasting inflation of just 1.3% next year, 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. When asked if that counted as meeting the ECB target of inflation below but close to 2%, Draghi said: \u201cNot really, so we have to persist.\u201d The central bank is expecting only modest economic growth for the eurozone over coming years. It believes GDP growth this year will come in at 1.7%, will match that pace again in 2017 and then ease to 1.6% in 2018 and 2019. Jennifer McKeown, at the consultancy Capital Economics, noted how the ECB\u2019s language reflected a climate of heightened political uncertainty. \u201cPresumably, the Bank has been encouraged by signs that the economy is performing well in the face of political uncertainty at home and abroad. However, it clearly remains in cautious mode,\u201d she said. \u201cIn all, we see a significant chance that the ECB will have to increase the pace of its asset purchases again next year. And even if it does not, policy will be far more supportive than in the US, leading the euro to depreciate further.\u201d Draghi flagged up that uncertain climate in his press conference, referring to upcoming elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany. \u201cJust look at the election calendar for the year to come. That is by itself a source of uncertainty. Look at the rest of the world. Look at what is happening with the emerging market economies,\u201d he told reporters. He also echoed other central bankers, including Mark Carney at the Bank of England, as he repeated calls for governments to play a bigger role in driving economic recovery with moves such as improvements to infrastructure and productivity. Many investors had been hoping for an extension of QE at the same pace, rather than the reduction announced by the ECB and there were sharp moves on financial markets as traders struggled to make sense of the central bank\u2019s stance. The euro initially jumped and then fell back. Yields on government bonds, which move inversely to prices, climbed as traders reacted to the prospect of lower ECB demand from April. Stock markets rallied as bank shares in particular benefited from hopes that a period of ultra-low interest rates might be finally nearing an end. The ECB also used its latest meeting to relax the rules over which bonds it can purchase under QE, reflecting worries that after years of QE it could run out of assets to buy. The changes to the QE programme follow criticism from Germany that loose monetary policy in the eurozone was hurting savers and fuelling rightwing nationalism. In the past, Draghi has rebuffed those attacks and stressed low rates and QE were needed to get inflation back to target. On Thursday, he reiterated that the ECB was not biased towards the currency bloc\u2019s less prosperous southern states. While Draghi was at pains to reject suggestions the ECB was tapering, many market commentators said the central bank was in fact doing just that. \u201cThis is effectively tapering,\u201d said Marilyn Watson, bond market strategist at asset manager BlackRock. \u201cThe ECB\u2019s announcement, in our view, continues a trend among major central banks of moving away from ever-looser monetary policy stances.\u201d Others highlighted the ECB\u2019s apparent attempts to keep all camps happy. \u201cThe announcement had something for just about everyone. Those looking for a tapering would welcome the forthcoming drop in the monthly purchase amount,\u201d said Grant Lewis and Mantas Vanagas, at Daiwa Capital Markets. \u201cBut others will welcome the fact that the total additional amount of purchases is larger than if the ECB had simply announced a six-month extension of its current purchase pace.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Court rejects bid to halt Southern train drivers' industrial action", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The high court has rejected an attempt by the owners of Southern rail to prevent train drivers from taking industrial action. The operators of Southern, Govia Thameslink Railway, had argued that the action by members of the Aslef union, which includes an overtime ban as well as impending strikes, was contrary to European law guaranteeing the rights of people to travel and of companies to invest, with GTR being partially owned by the French firm Keolis. But the judge, Sir Michael Burton, turned down GTR\u2019s bid for an injunction. The company has said the journeys of hundreds of thousands of commuters will be severely affected, with no trains at all expected to run during three days of strikes by drivers next week. The overtime ban was overwhelmingly endorsed by a ballot of Southern drivers in Aslef. It is part of a long-running dispute about Southern\u2019s plans to bring in more driver-only operated trains. A smaller but clear majority voted to strike as well. The overtime ban by drivers is likely to have a more significant effect than the parallel series of strikes by Southern\u2019s conductors from the RMT union, with Southern now warning of severe daily disruption until further notice. A shortage of drivers has left it reliant on voluntary overtime to fill rosters. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, said the legal case by GTR was a waste of money. \u201cSouthern, Britain\u2019s worst private train company, has wasted shareholders\u2019 money, passengers\u2019 money and taxpayers\u2019 money \u2013 because the company has been handsomely subsidised by the Conservative government \u2013 on a case it was always going to lose,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the company should do the right thing and sit down with us and negotiate \u2013 properly, sensibly and in good faith \u2013 to do a deal for the benefit of passengers, staff and, yes, the company. Just like ScotRail did with us earlier this year.\u201d Nick Brown, the chief operating officer of Govia Thameslink Railway, said: \u201cNaturally we are disappointed. The judge said that such unprecedented strike action by Aslef would cause massive disruption to the public. \u201cThe judge also said the widespread use of trains using driver operation is perfectly safe both in Southern and elsewhere in the UK. We brought this action for the benefit of our passengers. The judge has given us permission to go to the court of appeal, which we will now consider with our legal team.\u201d Whelan said the union was happy to talk to GTR but that the company had not been prepared to negotiate. He said this stance had been encouraged by the Department for Transport. \u201cChris Grayling, the secretary of state for transport, said this strike was political. A line which has been parroted by GTR. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s industrial. Driver-only operation is inherently unsafe.\u201d The news came on the third and final day of another strike by RMT conductors on Southern, but the first during which the overtime ban was also applied, leaving Southern running only about half of its normal service. The company said train services on Friday, when the RMT strike will have ended, would still be severely reduced across much of Southern and on the Gatwick Express. Alex Foulds, the deputy chief operating officer of GTR, said: \u201cTomorrow is the first day when Aslef\u2019s overtime ban will be felt on a non-strike day. We\u2019re sincerely sorry but passengers are advised services will be severely reduced and, on some routes, cancelled altogether. We will put on rail replacement buses where we can. We urge people to check before they travel on the day.\u201d The first full day of strike action by Aslef will be next Tuesday, 13 December, with two more days to follow on Wednesday and Friday, as well as six consecutive days in January. \u201cPeter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Southern Rail, said he believed that it would be first time since 1994 that London Victoria-Brighton trains had been completely stopped by strikes. \u201cThe prospect of not a single Southern train running on Tuesday will be a catastrophe for passengers, businesses and the wider economy during the busy Christmas period. There is now no end in sight to this misery. \u201cThe government now offers the only way out of the situation so ministers must stop hiding in the shadows of this dispute and become an active partner in finding a resolution.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Pensions Regulator has warned there are still major hurdles to overcome to secure the future of Tata Steel\u2019s UK pension scheme, which is pivotal for saving the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. Tata Steel and trade union leaders have agreed a deal to save 8,000 jobs in the steel industry and the Port Talbot steelworks, with the Indian company committing \u00a31bn of new investment to its UK business. However, the deal is reliant on employees agreeing to changes to the British Steel pension scheme, which has liabilities of \u00a315bn and 130,000 members. Tata Steel wants to shut the final salary pension scheme and replace it with a less generous defined contribution scheme. But the company is yet to confirm how it will fund the existing benefits, with the scheme at risk of entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which would result in a 10% cut to members\u2019 benefits. Steelworkers will vote on the changes early in the new year. The government has reversed plans to change the law so that Tata Steel can restructure the scheme by moving it into a new vehicle and shifting the annual inflation-linked increase in benefits to a lower CPI measure rather than RPI. Instead the government will not interfere in the restructuring and will leave it to Tata, pension trustees and the Pensions Regulator. But the regulator has warned that there is a lot of work to do to resolve the problems facing the pension scheme. It has to approve the entry of a pension scheme into the PPF or any major changes to pension benefits and a company\u2019s commitment to the scheme. As the BHS scandal has demonstrated, the Pensions Regulator has the power to pursue companies and individuals if it believes they have dodged their commitment to a pension scheme. A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe note the announcement from Tata Steel and look forward to seeing more detail from them regarding any proposal for the British Steel pension scheme. There are still significant issues to be resolved and we will consider any proposals carefully in light of their impact upon the 130,000 pension scheme members and PPF levy payers.\u201d Tata Steel says it is \u201cworking separately on a necessary structural solution\u201d for the scheme, but critics claim the company has not yet revealed a solution that tackles the liabilities behind it. John Ralfe, a pension consultant, said: \u201cBecause major disposals have reduced Tata Steel\u2019s creditworthiness, the pension trustees should demand higher deficit contributions, so the total annual cash contribution could easily go up. Closing the defined-benefit scheme does nothing to address the existing \u00a315bn of liabilities.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Pensions Regulator has warned there are still major hurdles to overcome to secure the future of Tata Steel\u2019s UK pension scheme, which is pivotal for saving the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales.</p> <p>Tata Steel and trade union leaders have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/07/tata-steel-commits-to-keeping-port-talbot-open\">agreed a deal to save 8,000 jobs in the steel industry and the Port Talbot steelworks</a>, with the Indian company committing \u00a31bn of new investment to its UK business.</p> <p>However, the deal is reliant on employees agreeing to changes to the British Steel pension scheme, which has liabilities of \u00a315bn and 130,000 members. Tata Steel wants to shut the final salary pension scheme and replace it with a less generous defined contribution scheme. But the company is yet to confirm how it will fund the existing benefits, with the scheme at risk of entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which would result in a 10% cut to members\u2019 benefits. Steelworkers will vote on the changes early in the new year. </p> <p>The government has reversed plans to change the law so that Tata Steel can restructure the scheme by moving it into a new vehicle and shifting the annual inflation-linked increase in benefits to a lower CPI measure rather than RPI. Instead the government will not interfere in the restructuring and will leave it to Tata, pension trustees and the Pensions Regulator.</p> <p>But the regulator has warned that there is a lot of work to do to resolve the problems facing the pension scheme. It has to approve the entry of a pension scheme into the PPF or any major changes to pension benefits and a company\u2019s commitment to the scheme. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs\">As the BHS scandal has demonstrated</a>, the Pensions Regulator has the power to pursue companies and individuals if it believes they have dodged their commitment to a pension scheme.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe note the announcement from Tata Steel and look forward to seeing more detail from them regarding any proposal for the British Steel pension scheme. There are still significant issues to be resolved and we will consider any proposals carefully in light of their impact upon the 130,000 pension scheme members and PPF levy payers.\u201d</p> <p>Tata Steel says it is \u201cworking separately on a necessary structural solution\u201d for the scheme, but critics claim the company has not yet revealed a solution that tackles the liabilities behind it.</p> <p>John Ralfe, a pension consultant, said: \u201cBecause major disposals have reduced Tata Steel\u2019s creditworthiness, the pension trustees should demand higher deficit contributions, so the total annual cash contribution could easily go up. Closing the defined-benefit scheme does nothing to address the existing \u00a315bn of liabilities.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s is to scrap its controversial Luxembourg tax structure in a corporate shakeup that means $1bn (\u00a3800m) of income from fast-food restaurants across Europe will flow through the UK instead. The move comes 12 months after Brussels competition officials announced a state aid inquiry into the fast-food chain\u2019s arrangements in Luxembourg, where franchise and royalty fees from across Europe have been pooled for the past seven years. In a statement, McDonald\u2019s said: \u201cThe change will result in the creation of a unified structure located in the UK with responsibility for the majority of royalties received ... outside the US.\u201d The reorganisation comes as European commission investigators continue to look into allegations that the group received a sweetheart deal from the Grand Duchy\u2019s tax office in 2009. They are examining whether the deal amounted to illegal state aid, generating huge tax savings for the US group. McDonald\u2019s and Luxembourg have denied suggestions the restaurant group received special treatment. Nevertheless, the US multinational has decided to unwind its Luxembourg tax structure. At the heart of the controversy is a Luxembourg subsidiary called McDonald\u2019s Europe Franchising Sarl (MEF). From 2009, this became the group\u2019s lucrative royalties-earning business in Europe. Independent franchisee firms and other companies within the McDonald\u2019s group pay MEF more than $1bn a year for \u201cthe right to use McDonald\u2019s restaurant system and related intellectual property\u201d. Latest accounts for MEF show it made a pretax profit of $536m last year, but paid tax of just $3.8m. That is an effective rate of 0.7% \u2013 well below Luxembourg\u2019s headline tax rate of 29%. Among the largest payments to MEF come from McDonald\u2019s own restaurant operating companies across Europe. Last year, McDonald\u2019s main UK business earned revenues of \u00a31.53bn from its restaurants, but was also charged royalties of \u00a3123m \u2013 equivalent to a third of its operating profit. These royalty fees dramatically lowered UK taxable profits so that the company\u2019s eventual tax charge for 2015 was \u00a356m. In a statement on Thursday, McDonald\u2019s said Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union was not a factor in the US group\u2019s decision to return its European royalties business to the UK, where it had been before 2009. \u201cThe reasons for changing the location ... were sound before Brexit and remain so beyond it,\u201d the company said. \u201cThese strengths are unlikely to change.\u201d How much tax the new UK business is expected to make is not yet known and may depend heavily on how much it is charged by other companies in the McDonald\u2019s group for loans or the use of intellectual property. The fast-food group\u2019s tax structure in Luxembourg uses some of the complex cross-border arrangements that have attracted widespread criticism from politicians around the world. In October last year, G20 leaders agreed a radical overhaul of international tax rules designed to stamp out such loopholes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a thinktank for developed economies responsible for drawing up the revisions, has estimated that, even on conservative assumptions, large global businesses were shifting profits and eroding the tax receipts of economies around the world at a cost of $100bn-$240bn (\u00a365bn-160bn) a year \u2013 equivalent to between 4% and 10% of global corporation tax revenues. Luxembourg was exposed as one of the most popular jurisdictions for tax avoidance planning two years ago after hundreds of confidential tax deals it had awarded to big businesses were leaked. These revelations, known as the LuxLeaks scandal, laid bare the extent to which the Grand Duchy was helping firms access tax rates of 1% or lower. Two former employees of accountancy firm PwC were convicted last year of theft and violating Luxembourg\u2019s professional secrecy laws over the document leak. They received suspended sentences, but prosecutors are pursuing an appeal against that decision, which will be heard next week. The whistleblowers have also lodged an appeal, arguing the trial judge had failed to properly consider how their actions had been taken in the public interest. They are asking the appeal court to overturn the convictions.",

These revelations, known as the LuxLeaks scandal, laid bare the extent to which the Grand Duchy was helping firms access tax rates of 1% or lower.</p> <p>Two former employees of accountancy firm PwC were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/29/luxleaks-pwc-antoine-deltour-avoids-jail-but-is-convicted-of-theft\">convicted last year of theft and violating Luxembourg\u2019s professional secrecy laws </a>over the document leak. They received suspended sentences, but prosecutors are pursuing an appeal against that decision, which will be heard next week.</p> <p>The whistleblowers have also lodged an appeal, arguing the trial judge had failed to properly consider how their actions had been taken in the public interest. They are asking the appeal court to overturn the convictions.<br></p>",

    "webTitle": "Markets soar as ECB extends QE programme until December 2017 \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A late newsflash: German media are reporting that the head of the Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, opposed today\u2019s moves: This explains why Draghi couldn\u2019t say that the decisions to extend QE was unanimous. (and that really is all for tonight!) Lena Komileva of G+ Economics has fired over a useful explanation of the ECB\u2019s policy measures, and the way it has steepened the yield curve on eurozone debt: This is important. The ECB is prioritising yield curve steepeners: the policy decision to embed a technical \u201ctaper\u201d in its 9-month QE programme extension, by scaling down its monthly purchases from \u20ac80bn to \u20ac60bn, to ensure policy continuity, sends a clear signal that there is a limit to how far the ECB\u2019s QE can run and how high the ECB\u2019s balance sheet can grow beyond 2017, before it runs into hard technical, and political, constraints. The ECB\u2019s announcement of changes to the parameters of the asset purchase programme from January by increasing the maturity range to 1-30yrs from 2-30yrs and buying assets yielding below the deposit rate (\u20110.4%) for the first time \u2013 also led to a sharp declines in the yields at the short end of the curve, reinforcing a curve steepener bias. The prospect of tapered monthly purchases and lower-for-longer negative yields means that the ECB\u2019s reflation channels have shifted in favour of a weaker euro and higher equity markets, with negative discount rates and a cheaper exchange rate clearly benefiting stock valuations. PS: It\u2019s also worth checking out the German government bond market tonight. The yield on short-term bunds has fallen deeper into negative territory, meaning prices have jumped because the ECB has now given itself the ability to buy this debt. But the yield on longer-dated bunds has risen, showing that investors are dumping the debt -- showing disappointment that the QE rate has been cut to \u20ac60bn per month. And it was a volatile day in the bond markets, as traders tried to keep up with Draghi Here\u2019s what you need to know about the European Central Bank\u2019s decision. 1) The European Central Bank has pledged to pump more money into the eurozone economy until the end of next year, and longer if needed. At today\u2019s meeting, its governing council decided to extend its asset purchase scheme (which buys assets from banks with newly created money) by an extra nine months. From April 2017 it will buy \u20ac60bn of assets each month, down from \u20ac80bn. President Mario Draghi insisted that Europe\u2019s economy needed more stimulus, help drive inflation and growth back up. There are indications of a somewhat stronger global recovery. However, economic growth in the euro area is expected to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors. 2) Draghi said the decision had \u201cvery, very broad\u201d support - implying that he couldn\u2019t get unanimous backing for the plan. This analysis shows that the changes mean the ECB now shouldn\u2019t run out of eligible assets until 2018: 3) Draghi was adamant that the ECB is not \u201ctapering\u201d its QE programme, leaving some City experts a little confused. The ECB president argues that today\u2019s changes to not amount to tapering, as there\u2019s no plan to stop asset purchases. \u201cThe natural way to look at a word like that is to have a policy whereby purchasers would gradually go to zero, and that\u2019s not been discussed or, as a matter of fact, it\u2019s not even been on the table.\u201d Draghi gave increasingly terse answers to journalists who tried to push him on this issue -- clearly the president doesn\u2019t want to provoke a US-style \u2018taper tantrum\u2019 by encouraging bond investors to sell up. He insisted that the ECB could boost the pace of asset purchases if circumstances demanded, or run the programme into 2018. But Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services wasn\u2019t convinced: The problem is that however much Draghi tried, and by the end of the press conference he was not only very irritated by the endless taper questions and stumbling in terms of explanation, he could not refute the point that cutting to \u20ac60bn/month could be a staging post to further cuts, because it is simply not refutable. It may not be their intended path, but it is not out of the realm of possibilities. 4) The ECB also made some important changes to its QE programme, including removing the limit that prevented it buying extremely expensive bonds. The ECB will now consider buying bonds with a yield below its deposit rate (the interest rates charged on bank deposits at the ECB). That deposit rate is a historically low MINUS 0.4% (to encourage banks to get out and lend). So the ECB can now buy more bonds for more than their face value -- meaning it would incur losses when the bonds mature. Why would it do that? Because it widens the pool of potential assets which can be mopped up by the ECB. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: The ECB had to change its standards for bond purchases to ensure that its QE programme did not disrupt the debt markets. It will now include bond purchases below its own deposit rate, which is already -0.4%. Thus, the ECB will be paying to hold some bonds that will be included in its QE programme. The craziness doesn\u2019t stop there, some of those bonds have a negative yield because of the ECB\u2019s QE programme in the first place. This meeting has been like a financial version of Alice in Wonderland. 5) Shares up, euro down. The euro has now slid all the way back to $1.061 against the US dollar, down 1.3 cents today, having been pressing its nose against $1.08 before the ECB announcement. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: \u201cThe euro plunged after ECB chief Mario Draghi presented an unexpectedly dovish outlook on monetary policy, hinting that QE could go on for years if required. In fact he even said the QE programme is \u2018in effect open-ended\u2019 and the overall dovish tone of the announcement means EURUSD is down 1% having risen earlier in the day. It\u2019s fair to say this is at the dovish end of what markets had expected. And that\u2019s why European stock markets have jumped, welcoming the prospect that the ECB will remain in \u2018easing mode\u2019 until the end of next year. 6) Draghi warned against complacency over the impact which the Brexit vote, and Donald Trump\u2019s election win, will have on the eurozone and the financial markets. \u201cIt is difficult to judge the effect of these big events,not only the election of Mr Trump, but Brexit, the defeat of the Italian referendum. Markets proved much more resilient than people expected them to be. This probably has many reasons, many causes. One of these is certainly the good work that regulators have done ... All these events ... have effects that by their very nature are going to develop their full dimensions in the medium to long term ... these consequences are very difficult to assess now.\u201d Quite. That\u2019s a good moment to end this blog. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW. Frank Engels, head of fixed income at Union Investment, explains why shares have jumped: \u201cToday\u2019s ECB decision was a very smart move of Mario Draghi. Lowering the monthly purchasing volume, abandoning the yield floor for security purchases and extending the program\u2019s maturity should cause the yield curve to become steeper, with the short end firmly anchored. This is a strong support signal for equities, particularly for banks and insurance companies. It is bearish, but not overly bearish for rates, though. We consider today\u2019s decision to be the first step out of the ECB\u2019s QE.\u201d Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic have jumped, as the promise of more cheap money raises spirits on the trading floors. Investors are welcoming the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to extend its QE programme by an extra nine months. The slump in the euro, now down 1% at $1.0634, has also driven up the value of European exporters. Germany\u2019s DAX hit a one-year high, over 11,000 points for the first time since December 2015. The French CAC also hit a one-year high. And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones index, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq index of tech stocks have all hit record highs in early trading. Q: Why didn\u2019t you decide on an open-ended QE extension, rather than just committing to buying more bonds for another nine months beyond March? Our programme says it goes until December 2017 or beyond, if necessary, and until we see a sustained rise in inflation, Mario Draghi replies. It is, to an extent, open-ended -- it\u2019s state-dependent. And finally, Draghi reveals that the ECB has made some changes to its securities lending programme - and will now accept cash as collateral (this wasn\u2019t expected, so we\u2019ll find some expert reaction). And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Summary and reaction to follow..... Q: How important is the recent rise in the oil price? It\u2019s an important change, says Draghi, driven by better demand conditions, better supply conditions, and the reestablishment of some international agreements. There is no doubt that these higher prices will feed into higher inflation, but we must see if it\u2019s just a one-off effect, whether it has any secondary effects, and if it effects inflation excluding energy costs. Q: What\u2019s the advantage to doing an extra nine months of QE at \u20ac60bn per month, not \u20ac80bn for six months? Draghi says the ECB wants to ensure a sustained pressure on market prices, without distorting them of course (perish the thought, Mario!) And we want to ensure that the reduction in size does not mean tapering (everyone got that? Good). Q: Your colleague Mr Mersch hinted recently that tapering might be discussed today, but you say it wasn\u2019t discussed. So how should we interpret these conflicting signals? I tell you what happened today, it was not discussed, insists Draghi curtly. Q: So did no governing council member argue for tapering today? Exactly, says Draghi, curtlier. Q: How would you respond to critics who say you have \u201cstifled\u201d the push towards economic reforms in Europe, by easing monetary policy so much Draghi gives a little sigh, and then replies. We\u2019ve been discussing this for a long time. Our view is different - we think that easing monetary conditions helps governments to implement reforms, he says. Governments can reform their education, judicial, political and legal systems regardless of the cost of borrowing, Draghi insists. Q: How would you respond to claims that you are biased towards Southern Europe countries, such as Italy, by extending your QE scheme? Draghi smiles, and says \u201cno, of course\u201d the ECB is not biased. Our policies are not very different from other top central banks, he points out. Q: Do you see a risk of a new eurozone crisis next year? Draghi does not. Different countries do have different problems, which should be dealt with stability, but these problems can be \u201ccontained\u201d. Q: Won\u2019t the ECB take a loss if it buys government bonds below your deposit rate? Our aim is to ensure price stability, not to make a profit, declares Draghi nobly (explainer: a bond with a yield below zero is trading above its face value, so an investor would not get back all their money when it matures) Q: What can central banks do in this current time of uncertainty? We must keep a steady hand, Draghi declares, giving governments the opportunity to strengthen economic growth and create jobs. Draghi is then asked about the US election. The financial markets have proved \u201cmore resilient\u201d to the shock caused by the Brexit vote, the US election, and the Italian constitutional referendum, says Mario Draghi. But he then warns that the full effects have not played out: All these events, especially Brexit and the new administration in the United States, have effects which by their very nature will develop their full dimensions in the medium-to long term. So we\u2019ll certainly see consequently in the medium-to-long term. Draghi says he doesn\u2019t expect any legal problems following today\u2019s changes to the ECB\u2019s QE scheme. The \u2018self-imposed boundaries\u2019 that we have changed today are not the ones which were needed to ensure the programme fell within our mandate, he argued. Q: You forecast an inflation rate of 1.7% in 2019 - is that close enough to your target (of close to, but below, 2%). Not really, Draghi replies Q: Why isn\u2019t this tapering, Mr Draghi? Tapering implies cutting the purchase programme down to zero, and that hasn\u2019t been discussed, the ECB president replies. Q: You\u2019ve said you\u2019ll boost the pace of asset purchasing if conditions worsen, so would you cut the pace of asset purchases if conditions are better than expected? We haven\u2019t discussed such a \u2018high class problem\u2019 says Draghi dismissively (dispatching the question into the stand for a six). Q: When might the ECB start tapering? Draghi says today\u2019s decisions were taken to ensure the ECB has a \u201csustained presence in the market\u201d. Q: How worried are you about Italy\u2019s banks? The problems in Italy are well known, and will be dealt with by the Italian government. The risk of deflation has more or less disappeared, but uncertainty prevails, says Draghi. And he insists that cutting QE to \u20ac60bn per month in April 2017, from \u20ac80bn, is not a tapering. Tapering has not been discussed today, he insists. Q: What is the economic justification in deciding to start buying government bonds which are yielding less than -0.4%? Draghi says that the ECB has decided to buy bonds yielding less than its deposit rate (currently -0.4%) \u2018to the extent necessary\u2019. It\u2019s an option, not a necessity. [explainer: the deposit rate is what banks get (or are charged) for leaving cash at the ECB\u2019s vaults] Onto questions... Q: Were today\u2019s decisions unanimous:? There was a \u201cvery very broad consensus\u201d behind today\u2019s decisions, Draghi replies. I think that\u2019s a no...and so does Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: It wouldn\u2019t be a Mario Draghi press conference without a lecture to Europe\u2019s politicians to pull their socks up. The ECB president calls for the \u201cswift and effective implementations of structural reforms\u201d to underpin the recovery. And he wants governments to \u201cintensify\u201d their efforts to create more growth-friendly fiscal policies, while still remaining compliant with Brussels\u2019 stability and growth pact. Important point: The ECB still sees inflation someway below 2% in 2019, at just 1.7%. That suggests monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time..... The ECB has also updated its economic forecasts, and expects marginally faster growth and higher inflation in 2017: Investors are racing to buy safe-haven German debt, following the news that the ECB has removed the deposit limit floor on its QE programme: And the euro is just as volatile as we warned: Draghi says that the \u2018calibrations\u2019 announced today reflect the \u201cmoderate but firming recovery of the euro area economy\u201d and the \u201csubdued underlying inflationary pressures\u201d. The ECB still expects the eurozone economy to recover at a \u201cmoderate but firming\u201d pace. And he warns that the risks to the euro economy remain somewhat to the downside, even though the global economy appears to be strengthening. HELLO! Mario Draghi says the ECB is changing the parameters of its QE scheme so that it can buy government bonds which are yielding less than its \u2018deposit rate\u2019 (currently -0.4%). That means it could start buying ultrasafe government bonds (such as German short-term debt) which are too highly priced to fall within QE. Mario Draghi is holding a press conference right now, to explain today\u2019s decisions. He\u2019s reading out the statement released earlier (which I posted here) It\u2019s being streamed live here (I\u2019ll try to add it to the top of this blog too). Financial blogger Jeroen Blokland shows how the European Central Bank\u2019s balance sheet will swell further next year, thanks to today\u2019s decisions: And here\u2019s yet more reaction: The ECB\u2019s task of nursing Europe\u2019s economy back to health is \u201cfar from done\u201d, says Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics. She believes the ECB may have to boost QE in 2017: Presumably, the Bank has been encouraged by signs that the economy is performing well in the face of political uncertainty at home and abroad. However, it clearly remains in cautious mode..... In all, we see a significant chance that the ECB will have to increase the pace of its asset purchases again next year. And even if it does not, policy will be far more supportive than in the US, leading the euro to depreciate further. Today\u2019s announcement is both hawkish and dovish, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. There is no free lunch at the ECB - they give with one hand, and taper with another! Was the statement dovish or less dovish than expected? The answer is both\u2026 The extension to QE is much longer than we expected, but the tapering announcement is almost hawkish, a mere three days after the Italian\u2019s voted No in its referendum. Government bond yields are rising, with the German 10-year bund up to 0.44%, from 0.34% last night. That means investors are selling eurozone government debt following today\u2019s ECB decision, even though the central bank has promised to keep buying bonds for another nine months. William De Vijlder of BNP Paribas says investors are reacting to the cut in QE: The WSJ\u2019s Chris Whittall agrees: Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet says that not really tapering, but it\u2019s still not what the markets hoped for. Finance Twitter is all agog at today\u2019s ECB announcement. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group gets a mince pie for summing up the QE changes in five words: Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons the ECB won\u2019t see today\u2019s move as a formal \u2018tapering\u2019 Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets wants to see the details of the QE tweaks mentioned in today\u2019s announcement. Carsten Brzeski of ING points out that the ECB is actually promising \u20ac540bn of new QE, not the \u20ac480bn which some investors expected (\u20ac60bn x 9 months vs \u20ac80bn x 6 months) The euro jumped sharply as the ECB announcement hit the wires, but has now dropped back below \u20ac1.08. Traders may be noting that the ECB is pledging to run QE beyond December 2017 if needed, or pick up the pace of bond buying again if conditions deteriorate. Basically, it looks like a \u2018dovish tapering\u2019 to me. Here\u2019s the full statement from the ECB, announcing that QE will run for an extra 9 months (I\u2019ve bolded up the key points): Monetary Policy Decisions 8 December 2016 At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council decided to continue its purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of \u20ac80 billion until the end of March 2017. From April 2017, the net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of \u20ac60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. If, in the meantime, the outlook becomes less favourable or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation, the Governing Council intends to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP. To ensure the continued smooth implementation of the Eurosystem\u2019s asset purchases, the Governing Council decided to change some of the parameters of the APP, which will be communicated at today\u2019s press conference and in a separate press release. Breaking: The European Central Bank has extended its bond-buying programme until December 2017, meaning an extra nine months of quantitative easing. But it has also started to \u2018taper\u2019 the scheme -- the ECB will only conduct \u20ac60bn of QE from April, down from \u20ac80bn previously. It has also left interest rates unchanged, at today\u2019s meeting. More to follow! Interesting..., bond yields are inching higher as traders brace for the ECB decision, coming any moment. The interest rate on German seven-year bonds has turned positive, for the first time since January [yields rise as bond prices fall]. That suggests they expect Mario Draghi to take a relatively hawkish tone today.... Donald Trump\u2019s election win has changed the landscape for the ECB in two ways, says Unicredit\u2019s Erik Nielsen on Bloomberg TV. It has pushed up the yields on government bonds (which tightens monetary conditions), but it has also weakened the euro (which loosens conditions). So the net effect is a small tightening, Nielsen explains. Economist Meg Greene reckons the markets would react negatively if the ECB started trimming its stimulus programme today: European stock markets are clinging onto their gains, as investors anticipate the ECB will announce a stimulus extension shortly. That could mean we see big losses if Mario Draghi disappoints. Also, the details of any announcement could also send shares and currencies into a spin: Joshua Mahoney of IG explains: An extension to QE seems somewhat of a foregone conclusion, with the current programme due to expire in March and no current plan for winding down the scheme in place. With market expectations already factoring in an extension, it is likely that the volatility could come about through any imposition of a tapering plan, with the bank having to find a way to gradually reduce the size of asset purchases as we approach the end of the programme. Right now, Germany\u2019s DAX and the French CAC are up around 0.4%, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 up 0.2%. Tension is rising in the markets, with just 45 minutes to wait until the European Central Banks announces its monetary policy decisions from today\u2019s meeting. JP Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Alex Dryden reckons the ECB will extends its stimulus programme, but trim the amount of bonds it buys with new money: \u201cWe expect the ECB will taper and lower their asset purchases to EUR 60 billion per month and extend the program by 6 to 9 months. However, the pressure on them to taper has declined in recent months, thereby increasing the chance that the keep the rate of asset purchasing unchanged and just extend the program by a few months. Rewind to September 2016 and 23% of German bunds were eligible for purchase. That number has now risen to 53% after the November sell-off in bonds. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale reckons Draghi must tread cautiously to avoid spooking investors: ECB President Mario Draghi\u2019s challenge at today\u2019s Council meeting is to broker a deal whereby he doesn\u2019t disappoint market expectations of an extension of the current (\u20ac80bn per month) asset purchase programme, while satisfying the demands of the more hawkish elements who want the pace of asset purchases to slow given the prospect of rising (but still low) core inflation and steady growth. It\u2019s a fine balancing-act which may be achieved by extending the programme without specifying the pace of buying, or maybe could see an extension with a shorter period of commitment to \u20ac80bn/month. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons Draghi will both extend and expand QE: Over in Athens thousands have taken to the streets as private and public sector employees stage nationwide protests to mark today\u2019s general strike, the tenth this year. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital The year may be winding down and events elsewhere in Europe may have hogged the headlines but in Greece anger, desperation and despair have far from abated. Faced with the prospect of further pay and pension cuts, thousands have joined protests called by unionists. Demonstrators carrying banners decrying labour reforms and \u201cnew and old anti-worker measures\u201d have been marching through Athens on a day when the country has been brought to a standstill by industrial action that has closed everything from archaeological sites to schools and private enterprises. \u201cMore measures are coming and it is ordinary people, workers, who will pay the price,\u201d Odysseus Trivalas, the acting head of the public sector union, ADEDY, told me as he prepared to participate in one of the rallies. \u201cLenders are asking for the impossible, for primary surpluses that will be absurdly high for the next ten years. That means there will be more cuts in pensions and wages, more poverty, more despair,\u201d The labour reforms, which include calls to abolish collective work agreements and allow for mass lay-offs, are now at the heart of a controversial bailout review between debt-stricken Greece and its euro zone creditors. In a statement, the private sector union, GSEE, described the measures as \u201cirrational,\u201d saying \u201cthe burden we carry is already unbearable.\u201d Greece needs to conclude the review to continue accessing emergency funding from the \u20ac86bn bailout \u2013 the third to be given Athens since 2010. Inclusion of the country in the ECB\u2019s QE programme by March 2017 - a move seen as vital if Greece is to return to capital markets anytime soon - is also dependent on it. Hit by its worst financial crisis in modern times, Greece is experiencing record levels of poverty and unemployment, at 23.1% the highest in the EU. Today\u2019s industrial action has been timed to coincide with debate in parliament over next year\u2019s budget, which foresees further tax increases and spending cuts. The leftist-led government is expected to pass the budget in a vote this weekend. Shares in two of Britain\u2019s largest bookmakers are falling faster than an unlucky punter\u2019s bank balance, after MPs announced a clampdown on fixed-odds betting. Fixed-odds terminals are notorious for being highly addictive, with some gamblers becoming hooked on roulette and simulated horse and greyhound races. And a cross-party MPs has concluded that changes are needed. They propose that the maximum stake should be cut from \u00a3100 to \u00a32, and the speed of the machines should be lowered too. The final report is due in January; today\u2019s interim findings have sent shares in Ladbrokes and William Hill down by 7.5%. Newsflash from Brussels: The European Commission has just launched legal action against several countries, including Germany and the UK, over the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal. Germany, Britain, Spain and Luxembourg are in the dock for not hitting VW with the same sort of tough sanctions which the company faces in America. The EC also wants Germany and the UK to explain why they didn\u2019t share the findings of their own investigations into VW with the rest of Europe European Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska says: \u201cNational authorities across the EU must ensure that car manufacturers actually comply with the law.\u201d The countries now have two months to respond; in theory, the EC could take them to the European Court. Shares in UK outsourcing group Capita have hit their lowest since the summer of 2006, after it hit investors with its second profits warning in three months. Capita warned that it faced \u201cnear-term headwinds\u201d, as it announced plans to cut costs and sell of some businesses. It also warned that underlying profits will be \u2018at least\u2019 \u00a3515m, compared to a previous target of between \u00a3535m and \u00a3555m. This sent traders scarpering to file Sell orders, sending Capita shares down 7.9% to 519, a decade low. Among other duties, Capita is responsible for providing including electronic tags for the Ministry of Justice, collecting the London congestion charge and the BBC licence fee, and running customer services for several major UK firms. Top ECB watcher Fred Ducrozet predicts the ECB will extend QE by six months at its current rate of \u20ac80bn per month, but retain the option to possibly taper next summer. He says the ECB must tread carefully today, to avoid spooking the markets: Amid growing evidence of a more robust recovery and improved policy transmission, there is a case for a reduction in the pace of asset purchases at some point in 2017, if anything because stocks matter more than flows in the ECB\u2019s view. However, signalling an eventual tapering of asset purchases now would almost certainly trigger an unwarranted tightening of monetary conditions, or \u2018taper tantrum\u2019, that might jeopardize the recovery and force the ECB to do more. The euro just hit a three week high against the US dollar, at $1.0799. That may show that traders aren\u2019t expecting Mario Draghi to be too dovish today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index reckons that the ECB may only extends its stimulus programme by an extra three months beyond next March. She says there are two good reasons for Mario Draghi to sound conservative today; a) the eurozone economic data has been quite good recently, and b) the ECB has been running out of eligible bonds to buy. So: We think that Draghi and co. will extend their QE bond purchases out until June 2017 This could disappoint some in the market, who may be looking for an extension until September 2017. Draghi may confirm that there is talk about how and when to taper, but no decisions have been made at this stage. Traders are bracing for Mario Draghi to create a lot of volatility in the markets today. Most economists expect the ECB to announce an extension to its QE scheme today, but there\u2019s no consensus on these details: Length: A six month extension seems likely, but the ECB could go longer, or shorter Volume: Will the ECN stick with its current policy of buying \u20ac80bn of government and corporate bonds each month? Tapering: The ECB could decide to trim the amount of bonds it buys each month The ECB could even delay a decision on QE until its next meeting in January - something that might spook the markets: Sports Direct shares have fallen by 5% at the start of trading, after it reported a sharp drop in profits. The retailer, whose working practices have been heavily criticised this year, told the City that underlying profits are down by 57% over the six months to October 23rd. It pinned some of the blame on the pound\u2019s sharp decline since the Brexit vote (but this isn\u2019t stopping the company spending $51m on a new plane for corporate business). And chairman Keith Hellawell also launched a broadside at what he called an \u201cextreme political, union and media campaign waged against this company\u201d, adding: \u201cI begin to question whether this intense scrutiny is all ethically motivated.\u201d Hellawell may be referring to the Guardian\u2019s undercover work at its Shirebrook warehouse -- for which my colleague Simon Goodley won a British Journalism award this week. Today\u2019s results also show that Sports Direct has agreed a cosmetics licensing deal with a company run by Ashley\u2019s youngest daughter, Matilda: The Telegraph\u2019s Ashley Armstrong tweets: More here: European stock markets have risen at the start of trading, on hopes that the ECB will extend its stimulus programme today. All the main indices are up, with Germany\u2019s DAX hitting a new one-year high. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says markets have made \u201canother perky start\u201d, ahead of the ECB meeting this afternoon. While the previously soaring banking stocks have cooled down somewhat, arguably because Italy has asked the ECB to give it until mid-January to rescue Monte dei Paschi, the DAX and CAC have immediately begun to build on the various highs struck on Wednesday. That is because the Eurozone central bank is likely to announce an extension to its quantitative easing programme later today, with analysts expecting Mario Draghi and co. to move the bond-buying deadline beyond its current March 2017 end-point The Italian government has written to the European Central Bank, demanding that it gives them more time to rescue Monti dei Paschi (MPS), says the Financial Times today. In a stern letter, Rome argues that the resignation of PM Matteo Renzi means it\u2019s impossible to finalise the MPS rescue quickly. They want the ECB, which regulates the eurozone\u2019s banks, to give them until mid-January to find the \u20ac5bn which MPS needs. The letter comes from the MPS board, whose largest shareholder is the Italian Treasury. If the request is rejected, MPS could be forced into a state-led bailout within days. The FT explains: A so-called precautionary recapitalisation would involve imposing losses on subordinated debtholders and the indemnification of retail bondholders, the people said. The ECB is due to review the request as early as Thursday. The ECB is understood to be unwilling to reveal its position until a letter is received. But bankers argue the supervisor is under pressure to take a tougher stance on MPS, which failed the European banks\u2019 healthcheck in 2014 and 2016, potentially paving the way for the latest stand-off between Italy and EU authorities. \u201cIf they don\u2019t give the extension, the ECB must take responsibility. They will be pushing the button,\u201d said one person. \u201cWe are only asking for five more weeks.\u201d FT: Italy demands more time from ECB to rescue Monte dei Paschi Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Like a greedy diner on Christmas Day, Mario Draghi has a lot on his plate today as the European Central Bank holds its final meeting of the year. Draghi and his colleagues on the ECB governing council must decide whether to extend their bond-buying stimulus programme, which is on track to run out in March 2017. Will they take the plunge and commit to another six months of quantitative easing, which is currently pumping \u20ac80bn into the eurozone economy each month? That would please the markets, which have grown addicted to regular glugs of ultra-loose monetary policy. But there could be a sting in the tail, if the ECB also talks about \u2018tapering\u2019 its QE programme, by trimming the amount it buys each month. That would remind investors that the punch bowl can\u2019t be refilled forever. Here\u2019s the timings: 12.45pm GMT/1.45pm CET: ECB announces its monetary policy decisions 1.30pm GMT/2.30pm CET: Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference The ECB must also consider the situation in Italy, where efforts to recapitalise its banking sector are dragging on. Unless there\u2019s a breakthough soon, the country\u2019s oldest lender Monte Dei Paschi could be forced into a state-led bailout. Also coming up... Sports Direct, Mulberry, Capita, and Ocado are all reporting results this morning. The headline news is that Sports Direct has posted a 25% tumble in pretax profits, and accused the media, unions and politicians of a damaging \u201ccampaign\u201d against the company. More on that shortly.... And we\u2019ll be watching Russian energy giant Rosneft, after the Russian government sold a \u20ac10.5bns stake in the company to a group of investors, including commodities trading firm Glencore.",

Any sale is not expected to affect the day-to-day operation of services on HS1, which has been performing in line with investors\u2019 expectations. HS1 is the 67-mile stretch of railway linking London to the Channel tunnel, on which both Eurostar and high-speed Southeastern services operate.

A source said neither Borealis or Teachers had been looking to sell but had been approached by a number of potential investors \u201ckicking the tyres\u201d of HS1. The review could end with no sale, or the sale of a stake, but the Canadian owners, while traditionally long-term investors, are assessing the scale of other potential interest. Borealis and Teachers paid \u00a32.1bn to the government for the concession in 2010. They also now own stakes in London City airport, as part of the consortium that bid in the \u00a32bn takeover this year. Teachers has a HS1 share in Bristol and Birmingham airports, while Borealis is an investor in Associated British Ports. HS1 is the UK\u2019s only high-speed railway to date. Parliament is expected to fully ratify plans for the London-Birmingham first phase of HS2 early in 2017, and the government may yet look at a similar concession model for the rail infrastructure. Significant interest in bidding for a rail line could boost the prospects of the planned line between Oxford and Cambridge, announced by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, this week to be funded with private investment and operated separately from the rest of the network.",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons is joining rival supermarkets in the housing business with plans to build 700 homes as part of the redevelopment of its Camden store in north London. The supermarket has teamed up with Barratt Homes \u2013 which helped Sainsbury\u2019s redevelop its Nine Elms store near Vauxhall, south-west London, with more than 700 homes \u2013 to put together its plans for Camden. As supermarkets have been forced to cut prices to take on the fast-growing discounter chains Aldi and Lidl, they have been seeking new ways to get more out of their assets. As less space is needed in many stores, a large number of which are in prime locations, supermarkets have realised that there is money to be made by renting out space to other retailers or businesses or by developing housing. Sainsbury\u2019s made \u00a395m in property profits from the redevelopment of Nine Elms alone and has said it has up to 10 other sites in London where it could potentially build more housing. It has already built flats above and around a number of stores including in Fulham. Tesco, which has built hundreds of homes around new stores in recent years, last month said it planned to unlock cash by selling the \u201cair rights\u201d above stores in prime locations. An initial 28 stores have been identified for projects that could lead to developers building flats over stores and excess car parking space turned into new residential or business premises. The supermarket is in talks with developer Apex Airspace, which is also negotiating with a number of other retailers about putting flatpack homes on top of stores in London. Morrisons held a meeting for Camden residents last week where it presented early plans for a development which would include flats and houses, public squares, other shops and offices on the site off Chalk Farm Road. The scheme would involve digging out part of a man-made hill created during the building of local railways so the Morrisons store will face on to a main road rather than sit above it. Housing, including affordable homes, and public squares would be built above and around the store with a car park underneath. Morrisons said the plans were at an early stage and it would be consulting further next year before seeking planning permission. It said Barratt was assisting with the planning application and it would be seeking a partner developer only if it got the go ahead. The Bradford-based grocer said it had no plans to develop housing elsewhere at present and property sources said the chain might be limited because its London stores, where building flats is most cost-effective, are mostly leasehold. Securing income from such schemes is unlikely to see a swift return for Morrisons in any case. Sainsbury\u2019s Nine Elms scheme was in development for a decade. Tom Edson, the head of out of town retail at property group Colliers International, said: \u201cThere are no quick wins and whatever a business does needs to balance the needs of the local authority for residential with continuity of trading.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The morale of staff at Sports Direct has suffered, says chairman Keith Hellawell, but here\u2019s news to cheer them up: profits may have halved but the company can still afford to spend \u00a340m on a new corporate jet. Employees can even hire it themselves for a jolly \u2013 though they will have to pay \u201copen market rates\u201d. But the arrangement that will surely infuriate outside shareholders is the deal whereby Sports Direct will buy cosmetics \u2013 under that must-have brand Sport FX \u2013 from a company where founder Mike Ashley\u2019s 20-year-old daughter, Matilda, is a director. Matilda\u2019s outfit is called Double Take, which is probably what shareholders did. Yes, Sports Direct really has responded to accusations of nepotism \u2013 after a distribution deal with Ashley\u2019s brother and a potentially lucrative property consultancy for the boyfriend of Ashley\u2019s other daughter \u2013 by doing this deal. Critics said Sports Direct is run as a personal fiefdom rather than a public company. Ashley, it seems, doesn\u2019t care what they say. Chairman Keith Hellawell, though, sounds jolly angry about how the media, politicians and trade unions have \u201cwaged\u201d an \u201cextreme campaign\u201d against Sports Direct. \u201cI begin to question whether this intense scrutiny is all ethically motivated,\u201d he said. Unfortunately, the former chief constable of West Yorkshire didn\u2019t say what conclusions he has reached. Here are a few facts to help his inquiries. This paper\u2019s expos\u00e9 of working conditions at the Shirebrook warehouse was honoured at the British Journalism awards this week. The business select committee\u2019s report was a cross-party affair and supported the thrust of the complaints made by Unite, the trade union, for many years. Sports Direct workers have been awarded \u00a31m in back pay as a result of the scrutiny and the company itself has admitted to \u201cshortcomings\u201d and pledged to do better. No doubt, life under the spotlight is uncomfortable. But there is a simple remedy, at least for Hellawell. After seven years in the job, and having failed to spot a crisis that was brewing for ages, he could resign. That was the wish of a majority of outside shareholders at the annual meeting in September. Ashley, with his 53% stake, saved his chairman but it remains hard to see how Sports Direct can genuinely claim to have turned a corner while Hellawell remains in post, raging impotently about scrutiny that would be applied to any public company.",

      "bodyText": "Mulberry has slipped into the red after investing more in products, but sales rose strongly as the British handbag maker\u2019s new collection helped it win back customers. The company announced it was setting up a new business in Asia, a key luxury goods market, as it reported a loss before tax of \u00a3500,000 for the six months to 30 September, compared with a profit of \u00a3100,000 a year earlier. The firm blamed increased product investment of \u00a31m and additional foreign exchange costs on overseas subsidiaries. Mulberry launched its first collection masterminded by its new creative director, Johnny Coca, with the full range going on sale in August. There are nine new bags, including a revamped Bayswater, one of its bestselling bags. It has also cut prices to win back customers alienated by a disastrous move upmarket in recent years. Money spent on creating the new collection, with modern totes and bucket bags, had a negative impact on gross margins but it attracted more customers and turned Mulberry\u2019s wholesale business around, where revenues rose 10% against an 11% decline a year earlier. As Mulberry opened a new store in Covent Garden in central London, retail sales climbed 10% to \u00a355.4m in the first half, with like-for-like sales up 7%. UK retail sales rose 7% on a like-for-like basis to \u00a345m, while international sales were up 10%. The chief executive, Thierry Andretta, said the investment in product design was paying off. \u201cMulberry\u2019s new collection under the creative direction of Johnny Coca has been well received by our existing customers and a new audience \u2026 The new business announced today in north Asia will progress our strategy of developing our retail and omni-channel model in key luxury markets.\u201d Mulberry struck a deal with its majority shareholder Challice to form a new venture to run its business in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Mulberry Asia is expected to be lossmaking for two years before moving into profit. Andretta warned that the UK and global outlook had \u201cbecome more uncertain since we last reported\u201d. The weaker pound has drawn more tourists to London, boosting Mulberry\u2019s sales in the capital, but demand from UK customers has softened in recent weeks. The sharp drop in sterling has also translated into higher raw material costs for Mulberry\u2019s UK production and higher running costs of overseas subsidiaries. Its two factories in Somerset, south-west England, manufacture half its bags. Mulberry reiterated its \u201cmade in England\u201d strategy. For the full year, Mulberry expects additional costs of \u00a31m due to currency movements and \u00a32m for investments in north Asia. Aside from handbags, Mulberry is investing in shoes and ready-to-wear products. Honor Strachan, lead analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail, said the new collection appealed a \u201cnew, younger shopper demanding more on-trend innovative pieces but with the craftsmanship and quality credentials that the brand continues to leverage and showcase\u201d. She added that \u201cinvestment in product design and creativeness must continue so that Mulberry stands out in the increasingly difficult and crowded Asian market\u201d.",

The shares lost 7.6% to 521p and were the biggest loser in the FTSE 100 by mid-morning. Fifteen months ago they were changing hands at 1046p and the shares are the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest loser this year. The company \u2013 which provides services ranging from electronic tagging for offenders to store card services for retailers \u2013 said it would sell assets and trim costs to protect its balance sheet after Brexit-related client indecision prompted it to cut its profit forecast for the second time in three months. Chief executive Andy Parker said he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d confident that the company\u2019s actions would allay the need to raise capital or cut the company\u2019s dividend. But he said: \u201cThere\u2019s been a fallaway in what we would call discretionary spend, like training and employee benefits. People are delaying making decisions on implementing technology, so there is a whole host of things going on,\u201d he said. Capita \u2013 which also recruits for the army and runs business travel, debt collection and translation services and employs 75,000 staff \u2013 said it now expects 2016 underlying profit before tax to be at least \u00a3515m. Three months ago the firm was predicting \u00a3535m to \u00a3555m, and prior to that it was expecting \u00a3614m. Net debt is now expected to be some 2.9 times earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation \u2013 up from a target already raised to 2.7 times in September. The ratio would fall to under 2.5 times by the time asset sales are completed, Capita said. The September downgrade had already alarmed investors and the market value has halved since then, bringing into doubt its dividend and the possibility of a capital hike. Rival outsourcer Mitie has also issued two profit warnings in as many months. Outsourcers have struggled since Britain\u2019s vote in June to leave the European Union as clients have delayed making decisions due to uncertainty and budgets remain constrained. Capita said it would now sell the majority of its Capita Asset Services division, which expects operating profit of \u00a360m in 2016. Capita has hired Goldman Sachs to sell the unit and has already had interest, Parker said. Capita is predominantly UK-based, unlike bigger rivals such as G4S and Serco that have been sheltered to a large degree from Brexit-related fallout by their bigger geographical footprint.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct chairman criticises 'extreme campaign' as profits fall 57%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of Sports Direct has criticised MPs, trades unions and the media for waging a campaign against the business as the retailer reported a 57% drop in first-half profits. The sports retailer, reeling from a year-long scandal over working practices, said underlying profit before tax slumped to \u00a371.6m from \u00a3166.4m in the six months to 23 October. Chairman Keith Hellawell, a former police chief who has been widely criticised by shareholders, said an \u201cextreme political, union and media campaign waged against this company\u201d had damaged its reputation, influenced customers and had a negative impact on the morale of Sports Direct\u2019s staff. He added: \u201cI begin to question whether this intense scrutiny is all ethically motivated.\u201d Hellawell said the directors accepted \u201cresponsibility for our shortcomings, but there has also been disproportionate, inaccurate and misleading commentary\u201d. The retailer\u2019s staff, he said, were \u201cincreasingly upset and angry at the barrage of detrimental comments about the company which in their view is unjustified\u201d. An undercover Guardian investigation last year exposed how Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the minimum wage. A scathing parliamentary committee report later compared conditions at its Shirebrook warehouse to a Victorian workhouse. Since then the company has been forced to pay \u00a31m in back pay to staff and offer more staff guaranteed working hours. But it has come under mounting criticism from unions, politicians and shareholders. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said the company was making changes, but that they did not go far enough. \u201cIt\u2019s a start \u2026 and it has to be a good step, but they continue to have real problems.\u201d He noted that Sports Direct\u2019s share price had more than halved since last December, from 650p. \u201cThis is a reflection on what happens when a company lets its governance systems collapse.\u201d The IoD\u2019s Walker said: \u201cThe problem with Sports Direct is fundamentally [chief executive] Mike Ashley, who owns more than half the company and is totally dominant. It needs a board that is capable of standing up to him so that the normal checks and balances that apply to most companies are in place.\u201d In the wake of the Guardian\u2019s investigation Walker called Sports Direct \u201ca scar on British business\u201d. Sports Direct\u2019s shares fell by 10% to 280p on Thursday. The company has suspended its planned share buyback \u201cuntil further notice\u201d. The retailer said its profit margins had been hit by the pound\u2019s sharp decline since the Brexit vote. However, Sports Direct added that it is also about to take delivery of a new corporate plane, worth $51.1m (\u00a340m). The company already has its own helicopter, a fleet of vehicles and also owns an inn in Worksop. The company has also done a deal with a beauty company run by the youngest daughter of Mike Ashley, the billionaire founder of the company. Double Take \u2013 a cosmetics company owned by Mike Ashley and where 20-year-old Matilda Ashley is a director \u2013 is licensing the rights to a beauty brand called Sports FX to Sports Direct. Royalties and other fees may be paid to Double Take, but not until after 2019. This is not the first deal to involve members of Ashley\u2019s family. The retailer has a deal with a delivery company called Barlin, which is 100% owned by Mike Ashley\u2019s brother John. Barlin processes international sales for Sports Direct and the arrangement is under investigation by City watchdogs. In its half-year profits update Sports Direct said the Barlin deal \u201cwas entered into under market terms, and makes good commercial sense\u201d. Ashley said: \u201cThe last six months have been tough for our people and performance. Our people have once again found themselves in the spotlight through no fault of their own, yet they remain hard working and loyal. My immediate priority will be to protect the people at Sports Direct.\u201d Clive Lewis MP, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, said: \u201cIt is not surprising that Sports Direct\u2019s profits have taken a hit given the revelations that employees have been paid less than the minimum wage for years, made to work in Victorian conditions, and the collapse of corporate governance structures that followed. \u201cThe reputational damage caused to the company is entirely of Mike Ashley\u2019s own making. He should focus his energies on reforming his business, instead of blaming those who have held him to account in the name of the public interest.\u201d Ashley said his long term ambition for Sports Direct was to become the \u201cSelfridges of sports retail\u201d. The company has appointed investment banker David Brayshaw as a non-executive director. Brayshaw has more than 30 years\u2019 experience with firms such as Barclays Capital, HSBC, Citigroup and glass manufacturer Pilkington and said he was \u201cdelighted to be joining the board of one of the UK\u2019s most dynamic companies\u201d. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at forex and spread-betting firm ETX Capital, said: \u201cThe company is blaming everyone else and it\u2019s true that negative PR of this scale is very hard to shake. But Sports Direct has had lots of chances to get its house in order and is paying the price today for failing to really overhaul its corporate governance. \u201cBut if chairman Keith Hellawell does eventually go on 5 January [at a shareholder meeting] and someone like independent director David Brayshaw steps in, then we might see investors warm a little more to the stock and this could be the nadir.\u201d The Financial Reporting Council said it had discussed certain issues with the company following its review of the 2015 annual report and accounts. The main issue was whether the retailer\u2019s strategic report complied with the Companies Act 2006 requirement to be balanced and comprehensive. The financial reporting watchdog noted that there was no discussion of Sports Direct\u2019s international stores, which are a significant part of its business. The company included information about stores in Austria and the Baltic states in Thursday\u2019s results and the FRC said its inquiries had been concluded. The regulator is also investigating the accountancy firm Grant Thornton over its failure to report a deal that Sports Direct struck with Barlin Delivery.",
