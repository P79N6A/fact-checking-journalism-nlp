      "bodyText": "Prospects of a sustained rise in high street activity lifting the economy out of its double dip recession were dealt a blow on Tuesday with news that consumer confidence is stuck at a low ebb. Following news from the CBI yesterday that retailers had their hopes for a summer surge in spending dashed, GfK's monthly survey on the mood of consumers found pessimism ingrained. \"Things are looking very bleak for the government,\" said Nick Moon of GfK, as data showed consumers remained gloomy about their own finances and the health of the economy. The measure for the general economic situation over the past year dropped one point to -59, and the balance of consumers expecting their personal finances to deteriorate fell from -9 to -12. The overall index score for July remained the same as last month at -29. \"This is the third month in a row the Index has not changed and consumer confidence has been stuck between -29 and -31 for the last seven months. This is a clear indication that all attempts by the government to improve the situation in the UK aren't making impressions on the public mood,\" said Moon. The CBI said weak consumer confidence coupled with the dismal weather were the two main factors behind the failure of July's retail spending to match the hopes of high street retailers. Of the businesses questioned in the monthly distributive trades survey, 44% said sales were up on July 2012; 33% said volumes were down. The balance of +11 percentage points was well down on the +42 expected when retailers were polled a month ago. The CBI's Judith McKenna, who is Asda's chief operating officer, said: \"The unprecedented poor weather for the time of year did not help, but retailers also expect conditions to remain tough during August. With consumer confidence weak and wage growth remaining sluggish, the longer-term outlook for retailers remains challenging.\" Chris Williamson, an analyst at Markit, said: \"Retailers previously had high hopes for July. When asked in June about expected sales in the coming month, optimism had risen to the highest in 18 months. Once again it seems the weather was to blame, with rain reportedly deterring people from the high street.\" The CBI suggested only a limited boost to retailers from the Olympics. A balance of +3 said they expected sales in August to be higher than a year ago.",

Europe's policy elite hit the panic button last week when interest rates on Spain's 10-year bonds soared above 7.5%, triggering pledges of support for monetary union in its life-or-death struggle from Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande as well as Draghi, the Italian who took over as president of the ECB last year. </p> <p>Financial markets, which rallied strongly following Draghi's comments, now want the central bank to put words into action, and have drawn up a list of possible options for what is seen as a crunch meeting.</p> <h2><strong>Option 1: Bond buying</strong></h2> <p>In the past, the ECB has bought the bonds of troubled member states \u2013 such as Spain and Italy \u2013 indirectly from players in the financial markets. These so-called secondary bond purchases through the securities markets programme have ceased in recent months, but the ECB could reactivate them. There are two drawbacks to this idea: the German Bundesbank is opposed and, in the event of a debt write-down similar to that already seen in Greece, the ECB will insist that it gets its money back in full. If the ECB takes a bigger share of the market, the potential losses for private-sector investors will be higher, and that could lead them to dump their bonds.</p> <h2><strong>Option 2: Hand out more cheap cash to banks</strong></h2> <p>One of Draghi's first actions as ECB chief was to announce a long-term refinancing operation (LTRO). This provided cheap cash for Europe's banks for a three-year period and was designed to help them with their day-to-day funding (or liquidity) requirements. A second LTRO followed early this year and there is speculation that a third could be announced on Thursday. The hope would be that Europe's banks use the cash to buy the bonds issued by their own governments, although there is no guarantee that they would. The extra demand should push bond prices up and yields down. Draghi, judging by last week's speech, appears to believe a third LTRO is not required.</p> <h2><strong>Option 3: Joint ECB/EFSF action</strong></h2> <p>The ECB is unlikely to risk German wrath by buying bonds directly from governments, something the Bundesbank insists would be illegal under the central bank's constitution. But there could be joint action between the ECB and the bailout fund bankrolled by the member states of the eurozone. This is currently the European financial stability facility, but will become the European stability mechanism in September. One idea being floated is that the EFSF/ESM would buy up bonds from sovereign states and this would be reinforced by buying in the secondary markets by the ECB. The aim would be to push up the price of bonds, leading to a fall in the interest rates governments have to pay on borrowing. Lower interest rates should boost growth. Spain would be the most likely beneficiary of such a policy, but would have to subject itself to a formal bailout programme, something Madrid is unwilling to do.</p> <h2><strong>Option 4: Make the bailout fund into a bank</strong></h2> <p>One or two members of the ECB council have floated the notion of giving the ESM a banking licence. This sounds like a technical matter, but would have wide-ranging implications since it would make the bailout mechanism eligible for refinancing by the ECB. This would boost the power of the ESM, but is a no-no for the Germans, fearful would increase the risk of a downgrade for the AAA-rated countries putting up capital for the fund.</p> <h2><strong>Option 5: Cut interest rates</strong></h2> <p>The ECB cut its refinancing rate \u2013 the equivalent of the Bank of England's bank rate \u2013 to 0.75% earlier this month and could decide on a further cut on Thursday. Such a move. A further cut on Thursday looks unlikely, and would be something of a damp squib for markets that are looking for something more. The risk of disappointment is high.</p>",

The issue is not just the ECB's legal authority under the Maastricht Treaty, but, more importantly, the appropriateness of alternative measures.</p> <p>Nowotny, the president of the National Bank of Austria, suggested that the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) might (if the German constitutional court allows it to come into existence) be given a banking license, which would allow it to borrow from the ECB and greatly expand its ability to purchase eurozone sovereign bonds.

      "bodyText": "Recent statements by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and Bank governor Ewald Nowotny have reopened the debate about the desirable limits to ECB policy. The issue is not just the ECB's legal authority under the Maastricht Treaty, but, more importantly, the appropriateness of alternative measures. Nowotny, the president of the National Bank of Austria, suggested that the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) might (if the German constitutional court allows it to come into existence) be given a banking license, which would allow it to borrow from the ECB and greatly expand its ability to purchase eurozone sovereign bonds. Draghi later declared that the ECB can and will do whatever is necessary to prevent high sovereign-risk premia from \"hampering the functioning of monetary policy\".

The Dublin-based carrier's latest idea is a radical change to basic aeroplane design: it has revealed that a Chinese aviation business is working on a prototype budget-carrier jet with extra-wide doors. Howard Millar, Ryanair's deputy chief executive, said bigger doors would allow people on and off more quickly, slicing minutes off the quick turnaround times that are a keystone of any low-cost carrier. \"We want two people to walk through the door. If the door is wider you can load people on and off the aircraft quicker. We want a low-cost plane that suits our business model,\" said Millar. The Ryanair executive added that the airline had got off to a good start with its design agreement with Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), a state-owned business that has not batted an eyelid at Ryanair's more progressive suggestions. On the other hand Boeing and Airbus, said Millar, were not interested in a bespoke aircraft. \"Boeing and Airbus will look at you as if you have two heads if you have a bigger door,\" said Millar, whose airline operates nearly 300 Boeing 737 jets but is now looking for a new aircraft order that will start deliveries towards the end of 2020. Ryanair is interested in Comac's planned 200-seater C919 aircraft, which is being developed to rival the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, the dominant players in the commercial aircraft market. The 737 carries 189 passengers, so the C919 offers the potential for more lucrative flights for Ryanair. The airline is notorious for squeezing out costs and raising cash via cunning ruses such as baggage check-in fees, and its passengers are used to hearing fanciful suggestions for plane adaptations from Millar's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, but Millar listed a series of pragmatic suggestions that have been delivered to Comac. They include smaller galley sections and a redesigned hold, to accommodate the fact that Ryanair does not serve meals on flights and carries fewer bags than traditional carriers owing to its baggage fee policy. \"Why do we need to carry all this additional weight in galley areas that we don't use? We don't really use the hold very much, so can we make it a bit lighter?\" said Millar. The deputy chief executive added that a Ryanair C919 would have the \"normal toilet quota\", referring to O'Leary's request for fewer toilets in Boeing 737s and the chief executive's suggestion \u2013 not acted on \u2013 of charging passengers to use them. Other mooted O'Leary innovations include removing one pilot from flights, having standing seats and, in one brainstorming session that was never heavily publicised, putting passengers in the hold.",

Prices are coming down, but much more slowly than might be expected given that the number of monthly approvals has fallen by more than 50% since the recent peak.</p> <p>One of the aims of the Bank of England's new funding for lending scheme is designed to improve the supply of mortgage funds, and this may help to boost the number of approvals over the coming months.

For the most part, lenders are taking a relaxed approach to those falling behind with their home loan payments, and low interest rates mean that the slice of household income that has to be set aside for the monthly mortgage payment is lower than it was during the crash of the early 1990s. What that means is that sellers are holding out for the asking price, and since that is higher than potential buyers are prepared or can afford to pay, the market is stuck in a low-activity equilibrium. Prices are coming down, but much more slowly than might be expected given that the number of monthly approvals has fallen by more than 50% since the recent peak. One of the aims of the Bank of England's new funding for lending scheme is designed to improve the supply of mortgage funds, and this may help to boost the number of approvals over the coming months. But the FLS is no magic bullet. With Britain in a double-dip recession, confidence among potential buyers is low and likely to remain so. They will insist on lower prices at a time when sellers are happy to sit tight. As a result, the property market \u2013 big enough to have a marked impact on the economy's overall growth rate \u2013 is going nowhere fast.",

    "webTitle": "Ryanair expects eurozone crisis to curb fare rises", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair has admitted that fare increases will be \"restrained\" this winter due to spending cuts and the eurozone crisis, as the budget carrier posted a bigger-than-expected fall in first quarter profits of 29%. The Dublin-based airline said yields \u2013 a proxy for average fares \u2013 will be held back this winter, despite it having posted double-digit fare increases in recent years, reflecting longer routes and higher fuel costs. \"Currently, we have no visibility of next winter's yields but expect that continuing austerity, EU recession, and lower yields at new bases will [continue] to restrain fare growth,\" said Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive. Ryanair's figures for the three months to 30 June fell short of market expectations this morning as the airline reported a net profit of \u20ac99m (\u00a377m), down nearly a third lower than the same period last year and below consensus forecasts of \u20ac114m. Revenues rose 11% to \u20ac1.3bn while passenger numbers climbed by 6% to 22.5 million, underlining the airline's power in the European short-haul market. Analysts said the profit shortfall was due to fare revenues coming in lower than expected, with fare revenue growth coming in at 4% when some analysts were expecting closer to 10%. The bugbear of Ryanair passengers \u2013 ancillary charges such as baggage check-in levies \u2013 performed more strongly and rose 8%. Ryanair shares fell 2.6% to \u20ac3.80 in early trading. Explaining the slow growth in fare income, O'Leary cited the same factors that are expected to hold back fares at the end of the year.

      "body": "<p>Ryanair has admitted that fare increases will be \"restrained\" this winter due to spending cuts and the eurozone crisis, as the budget carrier posted a bigger-than-expected fall in first quarter profits of 29%.</p> <p>The Dublin-based airline said yields \u2013 a proxy for average fares \u2013 will be held back this winter, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/01/ryanair-fares-to-rise-almost-10-per-cent\" title=\"\">it having posted double-digit fare increases in recent years</a>, reflecting longer routes and higher fuel costs. \"Currently, we have no visibility of next winter's yields but expect that continuing austerity, EU recession, and lower yields at new bases will [continue] to restrain fare growth,\" said Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive.</p> <p>Ryanair's figures for the three months to 30 June fell short of market expectations this morning as the airline reported a net profit of \u20ac99m (\u00a377m), down nearly a third lower than the same period last year and below consensus forecasts of \u20ac114m. Revenues rose 11% to \u20ac1.3bn while passenger numbers climbed by 6% to 22.5 million, underlining the airline's power in the European short-haul market. Analysts said the profit shortfall was due to fare revenues coming in lower than expected, with fare revenue growth coming in at 4% when some analysts were expecting closer to 10%. The bugbear of Ryanair passengers \u2013 ancillary charges such as baggage check-in levies \u2013 performed more strongly and rose 8%. Ryanair shares fell 2.6% to \u20ac3.80 in early trading.</p> <p>Explaining the slow growth in fare income, O'Leary cited the same factors that are expected to hold back fares at the end of the year.
