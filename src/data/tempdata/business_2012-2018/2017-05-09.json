      "bodyText": "The most irritating part of Theresa May\u2019s presentation of her price cap on energy bills is not her silly pretence that her policy, and Ed Miliband\u2019s, are chalk and cheese. Under a microscope, it\u2019s true one can tell the two apart. The Tory version could see prices increase sometimes under regulator Ofgem\u2019s six-monthly reviews; and, as far as we can tell, it will be imposed indefinitely. Labour\u2019s idea was a less flexible cap \u2013 prices could fall but not rise \u2013 that would last for only two years. But these differences are minor. The approaches come from the same philosophical bucket: the market is \u201cbroken\u201d and so politicians and/or the regulator must set maximum prices to ensure nobody is ripped off. It\u2019s a point of view, and few hearts will bleed for the suppliers. For 20 years, they\u2019ve run a business model that gives loyal customers the worst prices \u2013 a \u201ctease and squeeze\u201d tactic. The regulatory system may have encouraged them down this route, but the companies cannot be surprised that so many people think it odd that there are differences of \u00a3200 or more between the same company\u2019s standard rate and fixed tariff for a commodity product. So what\u2019s the most irritating aspect? It\u2019s the Tories\u2019 breezy use of last year\u2019s report by Competition and Markets Authority to justify a price cap. The key passage of that report said four out of five members of the panel had rejected their own initial analysis and now thought price controls were a bad idea: \u201cThe majority of us believe that attempting to control outcomes for the substantial majority of customers would \u2013 even during a transitional period \u2013 run excessive risks of undermining the competitive process, likely resulting in worse outcomes for customers in the long run.\u201d That part wasn\u2019t mentioned by May in the Sun as she confidently referred to \u201ca government-backed report last year that found households are paying \u00a31.4bn a year more than they need to\u201d. Yes, the \u00a31.4bn figure was highlighted by the CMA \u2013 but it concluded that a short-term fix in the form of a price cap would risk bigger problems. Business secretary Greg Clark, to his credit, acknowledged that he\u2019s backing the minority view within the CMA. But he and May have completely failed to explain how competition is meant to flourish while price caps exist. It\u2019s not hard to guess what will happen if suppliers are forced to cut \u00a3100 from 17m standard-rate bills. The companies will yank their discount fixed-price tariffs to minimise the financial pain for themselves. Indeed, they are already doing so. Switching rates may not collapse to zero \u2013 but a carrot worth, say, \u00a330 won\u2019t appeal to active punters like a \u00a3200 one does. May and Clark seem to believe Ofgem can somehow magic a figure that delivers both \u201cfair\u201d bills for everyone and a competitive market that encourages switching. Good luck with that, Dermot Nolan, Ofgem boss, it looks a tall order. Good luck, too, in trying to retain your status as an independent regulator: you\u2019ll be kicked from pillar to post, especially when there\u2019s an election around the corner. Go tell Aviva Shareholders are spoiled for choice with Wednesday\u2019s bumper crop of annual meetings. Is the best entertainment to be had at Barclays, where there\u2019s an opportunity to prod chief executive Jes Staley and ask him what on earth he was playing at in trying to unmask a whistleblower? Or should one be at ITV to tell chairman Sir Peter Bazelgette that, if he\u2019d been on his game, he would have started looking earlier for a replacement for outgoing chief Adam Crozier? Actually, the place to be could be Aviva, where Philip Meadowcroft, an activist veteran of these occasions, will be posing a tricky question to chairman Sir Adrian Montague: shouldn\u2019t you thinking of selling Aviva Investors, the fund management division? Aviva Investors, in the usual parlance, is in turnaround mode. The trouble is, it hasn\u2019t turned terribly far. Meadowcroft calculates that it delivered 0.2% of the cash remitted to the group last year and contributed just 4.6% of operating profit. Aviva is a large company but Aviva Investors is big in its own right \u2013 it has \u00a3345bn under management. As for its flagship multi-strategy AIMS fund, it may be gathering assets but the investment growth was a miserable 1.07% last year. In reply, Montague may plead that profits at Aviva Investors improved 30% last year to \u00a3139m, so describing it as a \u201cpermanent flop\u201d is harsh. Yet even he would surely admit that the division is not pulling its weight in the way that M&amp;G does at the Prudential and LGIM does for Legal &amp; General. A truly frank chairman might also concede that Aviva Investors needs to shape up faster if it is to remain a \u201ccore\u201d business. That would be a reasonable stance. Montague won\u2019t dare to be so bold, however, since anything less than full-blooded commitment tends to make investors, and the fund managers, nervous. Thus the chairman will be obliged to display confidence, however awkwardly. But it won\u2019t make the question \u2013 or the commendably persistent Meadowcroft \u2013 go away.",

A spokeswoman for BA said: \u201cWhen it comes to flying, we\u2019re the experts, so it\u2019s not surprising this bird wanted to hitch a ride on one of our 12 daily flights to New York. We could not help him out this time, but after a short delay we made sure our non-feathered customers got to the Big Apple as soon as we could.\u201d In March, a BA flight to San Francisco was unable to take off for hours because of a mouse on board the plane.",

      "bodyText": "The belated relief over Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory in the weekend\u2019s French presidential election, along with strong German trade figures and a recovery in resource stocks all helped to give European stock markets a boost. Germany\u2019s Dax reached a new closing high, while the FTSE 100 ended at its best level since the middle of April. In the US, both the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 hit new intra-day highs. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 41.35 points or 0.57% at 7342.21 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.43% at 12,749.12 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.28% higher at 5398.01 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended 0.27% better at 21,486.95 But Spain\u2019s Ibex slipped 0.42% to 11,049.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.96% to 778.37 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reversed its early gain and is currently down around 9 points or 0.05%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\\ll be back tomorrow. Many analysts believe another US interest rate rise is on the cards when the Federal Reserve gets together for its regular meeting in June. And in a speech in California, Kansas City Fed president Esther George has added to that impression. Indicating she believed the US economy was strong enough for further hikes, she said: The economy continues to expand as sustained job growth and solid gains in household spending \u2013 the weak first quarter notwithstanding \u2013 are mutually reinforcing. The international backdrop poses less downside risks today, further supporting growth at home. In this environment, the role for monetary policy is to support the sustainability of the expansion. Therefore, as labor markets continue to tighten, continuing the gradual removal of monetary accommodation is the appropriate course for the FOMC. And that does not just mean rate rises: Removing policy accommodation goes beyond increasing the level of the federal funds rate. The Federal Open Markets Committee also must begin to adjust the size and composition of its securities holdings. The Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet is currently about $4.5 trillion, or almost 25 percent of GDP compared to 6 percent of GDP 10 years ago. ...My own view is that the process should begin sometime this year by reducing reinvestments in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and long-term Treasury securities. Once it begins, however, the runoff in the portfolio should be on autopilot and not reconsidered at each subsequent FOMC meeting. Those expecting a market sell-off from the current highs could be disappointed, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Despite a lacklustre open, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 have already notched up record highs, while European markets have put in healthy gains. We have a market with no news, and no volatility, and this leaves us wondering what the next move will be. Everyone is looking for the next selloff, or at least the reason for the next selloff, so we will probably go without one throughout the summer. This market has the look of an express train, refusing to stop to let anyone on board. At least in London the rally has a broad-based look about it \u2013 we are seeing bargain hunters lifting the mining sector, but banks, retailers and housebuilders are also on the up. This is not a buying frenzy, but more a case of a careful pick-and-choose market. The tone is cautiously bullish, but with one eye on potential bumps in the road. And on the falling gold price, he says: It is possible to imagine a world where gold prices keep falling right to June and the next Fed rate hike. Dollar strength continues to wreak havoc in commodity prices, but for gold all hope of a bounce appears to have gone. Instead of slowing down, the slump seems to be picking up speed once again. With stock markets moving higher after the French election and the volatility index on the slide, investors are shunning assets traditionally seen as havens in difficult times. In particular, gold has fallen to an eight week low, down around $8 an ounce to $1217. UBS analyst Joni Teves said: Gold is currently facing pressure amid diminished political risks out of Europe and market participants anticipating the Fed to hike rates in June... With one of the largest political risk events [the French election] now cleared, some consolidation is warranted, albeit political uncertainty lingers in Italy and is likely to remain for some time. For now, the focus is likely to shift to monetary policy at the Fed and the ECB, which implies economic data will need to be closely watched. Further pressure cannot be ruled out for now, but we expect bargain hunting to emerge and physical buying to strengthen should the market test $1200, paving the way for a recovery. More signs of confidence in the US jobs market. Job openings were steady at 3.8% in March compared to February, according to the Labor Department, as was the quits rate at 2.1%. The latter is a key measure for Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, since it indicates workers are confident enough about the jobs market to move on. The actual numbers showed an increase from 3.03m to 3.1m. And Apple is not the only one: With US markets moving higher, Apple has hit another peak, adding 1% to more than $154 a share and valuing the iPhone company at more than $800bn. The company has crossed that barrier despite falling iPhone sales, which has been put down to consumers waiting for the next model to be launched later this year. And analysts at US broker Drexel Hamilton believe the company\u2019s shares could climb even further, putting a target value on the business of $1trn. A strong US company results season and the outcome of the French election have pushed American markets higher again. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have both edged higher at the open to touch yet new highs, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 8 points or 0.04%. And here\u2019s the Dax hitting new peaks: After Monday\u2019s muted response to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s weekend victory in the French elections, European markets have belatedly picked up the pace. In Germany, the strong trade data and a weaker euro have helped the country\u2019s stock market to a fresh intra-day high. The Dax is currently up 0.65% or 82 points at 12,776 having earlier hit a record of 12,783. France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.34% and the FTSE 100 is ahead 0.75%, with the UK index helped by a recovery in mining stocks and shrugging off the falls in energy company shares after the Conservative price cap proposals. Here\u2019s another chart showing how market volatility has fallen sharply in recent weeks to the lowest level since 1993, and MUCH lower than in the financial crisis. As explained earlier, the fall in the VIX means people aren\u2019t buying as many S&amp;P 500 options as usual (to hedge themselves against hefty swings in the markets). That suggests investors are more confident about market conditions. That could be justified, as economic conditions may be picking up as European political risk fade. Or it could be dangerous complacency. We\u2019ll know, either way, in a few month time.... Over in Australia, the major banks are reeling after being hit with a new tax. The Australian government announced the levy in its 2017 budget today. It will raise over six billion Australian dollars from the country\u2019s big five banks over the next few years. Each will pay upwards of A$300m per year based on their liabilities. Treasurer Scott Morrison claimed that it was a \u201cfair contribution from our major banks, similar to measures imposed in other advanced countries\u201d. More pertinently, it allows the Australian government to target a small surplus by 2021. But the banking industry is predictably irate. Australian Bankers\u2019 Association chief executive Anna Bligh claimed it was a \u201cpolitical tax grab to cover a budget black hole,\u201d and hinting that the public would pay the price. The banks don\u2019t have a secret stash of money ... there\u2019s only three places they can get this from \u2013 borrowings, deposits or shareholders or a combination of all three and every Australian has an interest in one of more of those parts of a bank\u2019s operations. Curiously, Australian bank shares slid before the policy was even announced, as rumours of a new tax swirled. Perhaps someone should impose a tax on leaks.... And here\u2019s our liveblog on the Australian budget: The job vacancies total in Germany has hit a record high, in (yet) another sign that its economy is robust. The number of unfilled positions jumped by 9,000 in the first quarter of 2017, according to new research from the IAB institute. That means there were 75,000 more vacancies than a year earlier. Rising vacancies often suggests that an economy is growing faster than its labour force, which ought to give workers leverage for higher pay. Global stock markets have \u201cfound their mojo\u201d today, says Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. He cites five reasons: Optimistic is derived from hopes that OPEC will extend [oil] production cuts at month end; Macron can form a working parliamentary majority; the Fed will hike because the US economy warrants it; the ECB will keep the QE taps open a little longer, and base metals prices have found a bottom after their recent sell-off. Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index has risen to its highest level since Theresa May triggered next month\u2019s general election. The FTSE 100 has now gained 42 points today, or 0.6%, to 7343. That\u2019s only 100 points away from its all-time high set in March. This morning\u2019s solid German trade data is helping to support shares across Europe, as it suggests global economic demand is holding up. That\u2019s good for mining companies, who continue to dominate the risers. Energy firms, though, are falling after the May\u2019s Conservative Party outlined plans to cap standard variable bills. Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, are down 1.6% while rival SSE has lost 1%. Chris Beauchamp of financial trading site IG says a \u201cbullish sentiment\u201d has returned to the City, although the energy cap plan is causing some angst. In London the embattled mining sector is finally seeing some support, despite little sign of a real turnaround in the ongoing fall in commodity prices. At the other end of the spectrum, Centrica leads the utility sector lower as the Conservatives bang on about their energy capping policies. Such a move is emblematic of the Conservative party\u2019s more interventionist stance. It will start with energy companies, but some will be wondering whether other sectors will come under pressure as well. So much for the Macron bounce! The euro has just dropped below $1.09 against the US dollar for the first time since last Thursday, having hit a six-month high on Sunday night. John Wyn-Evans, Head of Investment Strategy at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, has issued a research note on European politics following the French election. He flags up that the next potential pitfall comes next month: There are France\u2019s legislative elections to the National Assembly on June 11th, when we will see whether or not M.Macron can consolidate his position with a parliamentary majority. In truth, this looks like a tall order for his En Marche! Party which now has to find 577 candidates to field. Even so, there is a fighting chance that a working coalition can be formed with other parties to push through a reformist agenda. Matters can hardly be much worse than under Francois Hollande\u2019s lame duck regime. The next crisis could come from Italy, Wyn-Evans continues, where the Five Star movement is challenging mainstream pro-EU parties: Looming larger is Italy\u2019s forthcoming general election, which has to take place by May 2018. For Marine Le Pen, read Beppe Grillo; for the National Front, read the Five Star Party (5*). Although 5* is not, perhaps, as ideologically extreme as the National Front, it is definitely anti-establishment and not a fan of a more integrated Europe. But the threat is tempered by the fact that it is only polling around 30% of the vote (neck and neck with the Democrats) so would need to form a coalition to pursue its aims. Furthermore, a referendum on membership of the euro would require constitutional change, and former Prime Minister Renzi\u2019s attempts to do just that failed last year, suggesting an underlying resistance to big changes within the country. In any event, you can expect a sharp increase in the volume of commentary on Italian politics once a firm date is set, and markets to enter another period of uncertainty. One of France\u2019s most senior left-leaning politicians has thrown his support behind Emmanuel Macron. Manuel Valls told French radio that he wants to run for Macron\u2019s En Marche! campaign in June\u2019s parliamentary elections. This may fuel speculation that Valls could potentially serve as PM under Macron - a position he has held before. Reuters has the details: \u201cI will be a candidate for the presidential majority and I wish to join his (Macron\u2019s) movement,\u201d Valls, who was prime minister in Francois Hollande\u2019s administration between 2014 and 2016, told RTL radio. \u201cThis Socialist party is dead. It is behind us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe essential thing today is to give a broad and coherent majority ... to Emmanuel Macron to allow him to govern.\u201d Back in January, Valls failed to win the nomination for the Socialist party to succeed Hollande. Instead, the party chose Beno\u00eet Hamon, who trailed in 5th in the first round of voting as voters deserted France\u2019s traditional parties. At first glance, the news that Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge had hit its lowest level since 1993 sounds reassuring. The VIX index (officially the \u201cCBOE Volatility Index\u201d) measures market volatility by tracking a number of \u2018option calls\u2019 -- contracts to buy or sell securities at a certain price in the future. It goes up when investors are scrambling for protection, and goes down when they\u2019re not. So recent moves show that the markets are calmer. But, this situation rarely lasts long - as volatility has a nasty habit of rearing up again. One problem with low VIX is that investors can be tempted to add too much risk to their portfolios in a mad dash for a higher return on their investment. Anothe danger is that investors might lack protection for a stormy day, if they haven\u2019t taken up options contracts to hedge their exposure to the markets. Johan Javeus, chief strategist at SEB Group, has tweeted a graph showing how the VIX fell to a 24-year low last night: FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed fears that the low VIX could lure some investors could be tempted into risky trading: While this could be interpreted to mean that good times lie ahead, it also indicates that the party may be over soon. Volatility does not stay at low levels for prolonged periods of time, and we\u2019re likely to see the index reverting to its 200-days moving average around 15. Just don\u2019t let the extremely quiet market conditions trap you into taking huge risks. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says the fundamental problem is that central banks have distorted the markets by through their stimulus programme: Super-easy monetary policy is creating artificially low volatility and driving money into trades and investments that are mispriced as a result. After dropping yesterday, European stock markets are all rising this morning. Mining companies are leading the FTSE 100, with Glencore up 3% and Antofagasta gaining 2.5%. Today\u2019s trade figures show that Europe\u2019s largest economy continues to power ahead, says the FT\u2019s Mehreen Khan: Year on year exports were up an impressive 10.8 per cent in March while imports climbed 14.7 per cent \u2013 a sign of healthy foreign demand for German wares and buoyant consumer appetite within the country which boasted its best level of growth in six years last year. Germany\u2019s overall trade surplus \u2013 which hit a record in 2016 \u2013 is now at \u20ac25.8bn. Germany\u2019s dominant trade position is under the microscope again today, with new figures showing that it is importing and exporting more than ever before. German exports jumped by 0.4% in March, to a record-breaking \u20ac118.2bn. The rest of the world mopped up goods from major German companies, and the smaller firms that make up the Mittelstadt. But it wasn\u2019t a one-way trip; German imports jumped by 2.4% in March to \u20ac92.9bn. So the overall surplus actually dipped during the month, to \u20ac25.4bn, down from \u20ac25.8bn a year earlier. That probably won\u2019t assuage critics who claim Germany\u2019s trade surplus is destabilising the world economy. Destatis, the statistics body, says: These are the highest monthly figures ever reported for both exports and imports..... In March 2017, Germany exported goods to the value of \u20ac68bn to the Member States of the European Union (EU), while it imported goods to the value of \u20ac61.1bn from those countries. Compared with March 2016, exports to the EU countries increased by 8.7%, and imports from those countries by 13.5%. Germany\u2019s trade surplus has been As Associated Press put it: Germany\u2019s export imbalance is widely criticized by other countries, which accuse Europe\u2019s biggest economy of not doing enough to spur domestic demand for foreign goods. Berlin counters that products made in Germany are simply better than the competition. Separately, German industrial output in March was better than expected. Output fell by 0.4% during the month, compared to forecasts of a 0.7% decline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Following the excitement of the French presidential election, the markets are rather subdued this morning. After being relieved that Emmanuel Macron beat Marine Le Pen on Sunday, the City is are now pondering whether the En Marche! founder can actually deliver on his pledges. Some investors are now looking ahead to this autumn\u2019s German elections, and also to Italy, where the anti-EU Five Star Movement are topping the polls. As London Capital Markets\u2019 Jasper Lawler puts it: There are more political risks on Europe\u2019s horizon. Legislative elections in France in two months, German elections and perhaps a snap Italian election could yet see the European project derailed. Italians have already demonstrated a willingness to \u2018vote with their feet\u2019 when they blocked a government referendum late last year. But there\u2019s no drama yet. Shares are creeping higher in early trading, after volatility in the markets hit its lowest since 1993. That shows that investors are pretty confident right now. Too confident? Maybe, given the looming Brexit battle and the fact the world economy isn\u2019t in top gear. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: The reason is that the Macron victory does not mean that we are out of the woods, there are still massive challenges ahead of him and the issue of soft and hard Brexit is still very much in play. US Earnings for the Q1 were a little soft and the US GDP growth is nowhere close enough to its previous level- let alone what Trump wants. There\u2019s not much in the economic or corporate diary to spook investors today, apart from new German trade and industrial output figures. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The international backdrop poses less downside risks today, further supporting growth at home. In this environment, the role for monetary policy is to support the sustainability of the expansion. Therefore, as labor markets continue to tighten, continuing the gradual removal of monetary accommodation is the appropriate course for the FOMC. </p> </blockquote> <p>And that does not just mean rate rises:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Removing policy accommodation goes beyond increasing the level of the federal funds rate. The Federal Open Markets Committee also must begin to adjust the size and composition of its securities holdings. The Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet is currently about $4.5 trillion, or almost 25 percent of GDP compared to 6 percent of GDP 10 years ago. ...My own view is that the process should begin sometime this year by reducing reinvestments in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and long-term Treasury securities. </p> <p>Once it begins, however, the runoff in the portfolio should be on autopilot and not reconsidered at each subsequent FOMC meeting. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5911df16e4b0a8ea08b6ca45\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-09T15:26:02.045Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Those expecting a market sell-off from the current highs could be disappointed, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite a lacklustre open, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 have already notched up record highs, while European markets have put in healthy gains.</p> <p>We have a market with no news, and no volatility, and this leaves us wondering what the next move will be.

This is not a buying frenzy, but more a case of a careful pick-and-choose market. The tone is cautiously bullish, but with one eye on potential bumps in the road.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on the falling gold price, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is possible to imagine a world where gold prices keep falling right to June and the next Fed rate hike.

But the threat is tempered by the fact that it is only polling around 30% of the vote (neck and neck with the Democrats) so would need to form a coalition to pursue its aims. Furthermore, a referendum on membership of the euro would require constitutional change, and former Prime Minister Renzi\u2019s attempts to do just that failed last year, suggesting an underlying resistance to big changes within the country.</p> <p>In any event, you can expect a sharp increase in the volume of commentary on Italian politics once a firm date is set, and markets to enter another period of uncertainty.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591184dee4b092bfd201ef54\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-09T09:11:06.157Z\">10.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0a035ab4a581aa922fd3c6a1167cb56f8654af5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a035ab4a581aa922fd3c6a1167cb56f8654af5a/1589_54_3136_3094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former French Prime Minister Manuel Valls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"987\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>One of France\u2019s most senior left-leaning politicians has thrown his support behind Emmanuel Macron.</strong></p> <p>Manuel Valls told French radio that he wants to run for Macron\u2019s En Marche! campaign in June\u2019s parliamentary elections.

      "bodyText": "John Lewis profits have been dented by \u00a336m after a payroll error that breached minimum wage rules. The retailer, which owns Waitrose supermarkets as well as its namesake chain of department stores, said it was working with HMRC to examine its practice of pay averaging, which aims to smooth out monthly pay over the year. Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs enforces the national minimum wage and can fine and name and shame companies that do not comply. Current and former John Lewis workers, who are known as partners because they jointly own the retailer and share an annual bonus based on profits every year, could receive a top-up in back pay as a result of the review. The error affects all staff paid by the hour over the past six years. The John Lewis chairman, Charlie Mayfield, said arrangements had already been made to contact those affected and make payments. The total cost of the back pay along with employer\u2019s national insurance, pension contributions and other associated costs, could be as much as \u00a336m, according to the annual report, published on Tuesday. The issue came to light after a worker raised concerns about their monthly pay following the annual results published in March. John Lewis said employees received the correct pay over the year, but in months where those on hourly rates worked more than average pay fell below the national minimum rate required by law because of the pay averaging system. John Lewis has to compensate employees for any breach, even on such a technical basis, and so has now revised down its 2016-17 pre-tax profits before partner bonus to \u00a3541m, from \u00a3577m. \u201cThis arrangement was implemented to support [staff] with a steady and reliable monthly income, but we now believe this arrangement may not meet the strict timing requirements for calculating compliance with the national minimum wage regulations,\u201d John Lewis said. Mayfield added: \u201cHMRC are aware and we intend to work with them in order to resolve some of the key points regarding the way the [national minimum wage] regulations apply to our pay arrangements and practices. We expect to do this as quickly as possible. However, it is likely these discussions will take some time to be completed.\u201d The pay error comes less than four years after John Lewis was forced to pay employees an extra \u00a340m when it realised it had been miscalculating holiday pay for seven years. The company said it now planned to simplify its pay processes to ensure they were easier to administer and at less risk of non-compliance with pay legislation. The annual report also reveals that Mayfield has waived his annual bonus following a tough year for the company. The chairman\u2019s total pay fell 7.4% last year to \u00a31.41m according to the report. His basic salary rose nearly 5% to \u00a31.13m but Mayfield requested not to receive his annual bonus, which amounted to \u00a3105,000 the year before, and also took a reduced pension supplement. Mayfield has asked not to receive a rise in basic pay this year. Mayfield dropped his bonus as the company slashed its annual pay out to staff in March to just 6% of salary, the lowest level since the 1950s, despite a 21% rise in pre-tax profits. It was the fourth year in a row that John Lewis cut the award, taking it to the lowest bonus since 1954. The chairman said the bonus had been cut because the business faced cost inflation and increasing high street competition. While total profits rose strongly last year, trading profits at the John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets, excluding a benefit from lower pensions accounting charges, were up just 1.9%. The new boss of the department store chain, Paula Nickolds, has since warned of potential job cuts and price rises as the business tries to adapt to changes in the way people shop, particularly the move to online shopping.",

      "bodyText": "What do you do when you are a Liberal party and delivering Liberal party budgets makes you as popular as poison? Deliver one that with a bit of slight rebranding could almost look like a Labor one. This budget does not quite bring home the bacon as Paul Keating once said, but Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull sure as heck will hope it brings an end to people talking about Joe Hockey\u2019s 2014 budget. While the budget on the surface does look quite fair, we should remember the context. The budget still includes cuts to company taxes, which will in time offset the bank levy. It still includes the end of the 2% deficit levy for those earning over $180,000. Yes such people will now be paying an extra 0.5% points on the Medicare levy, but so will most other taxpayers, and no one else is getting an income tax cut to more than offset the impact. Let\u2019s just say there is a reason this budget still does not include the traditional table breaking down the impact on households by incomes. The budget has us returning to surplus by 2020-21. So how do we get there? 1. There was a revenue problem after all! After nearly a decade of saying the problem was all on the spending side, the 2017-18 budget is where the Liberal party has finally admitted that there is a revenue problem. The 2017-18 budget estimates that by 2020-21 the budget will be firmly back in surplus, and it does it mostly off the back of government revenue returning to the level it was during the surplus years of the Howard government. In the 11 years prior to the GFC, when the budget was either in surplus or balance, government revenue averaged 25.1% of GDP. In the nine years since the GFC, the highest it has been is 23.4%, and this year it was just 23.1%. To give some context 2% of GDP is around $34bn, so it\u2019s a fair gap. But that gap is about to be reduced. The budget predicts that by 2019-20 government revenue will reach 25.1% of GDP and in the following year a very healthy 25.4%. The last time we saw revenue at that level was in 2005-06: To get there the budget anticipates revenue growing over the next 4 years by around 4.4% in real terms. That growth was not uncommon during the mining boom years, but has been reached only once in the past nine years: And what it is the revenue that is growing? Income tax. The budget predicts that personal income tax in 2019-20 will grow by 8.5% and then 7.5% the following year. That is a pretty big increase: It will see personal income tax account for 51.4% of all taxation, while company tax, which is expected to grow by smaller amounts each year will account for just 18%. Back in 2007-08 at the height of the mining boom, income tax accounted for 44.7% of all tax and company tax was 20.7%. We are in effect shifting the burden from companies to individuals. And it also means there is no room for any further tax cuts unless Morrison wants to hit the revenue that is the biggest reason for reaching a surplus. While there are some cuts \u2013 such as the cut of $3.7bn over 4 years to higher education and $1.9bn to those on family tax benefit \u2013 overwhelmingly this is a budget that gets to surplus by increasing revenue. Government spending drops to 25% of GDP in 2019-20, but that is still higher than all but the two stimulus years of the Rudd/Gillard governments. 2. Morrison wants a wages breakout Oh for the days when conservative railed against strong wages growth; now we have a conservative treasurer desperate for wages to grow fast. The overall economic picture is little changed from that expected last December in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook. Real GDP in 2017-18 is expected to grow at 2.75%, and nominal GDP is up a touch from 3.75% to 4% and wages growth is expected to be just 2.5%: And it is for that reason that there is little change in the predictions for the budget balance next year. In last year\u2019s Myefo, the deficit in 2017-18 was expected to be 1.6% of GDP \u2013 and that is where it remains: The big changes occur in the \u201cout years\u201d of the budget \u2013 the final two years from 2019-20 onwards. Whereas in December the government was hoping the deficit 2019-20 would be around 0.5% of GDP, now it expects it to be just 0.1%. That will see the deficit shrink in that year by 0.9% of GDP \u2013$19bn. It is a very big jump in a time when the economy is still expected to be growing by just 3% in real terms and 4.5% in nominal terms. So where is the growth in revenue coming from? Yes it is coming from the increase in the Medicare levy, but that alone is not enough to see income tax grow by 8%, for that we need wages to grow. The problem as we all know is wages are growing at record lows. But never fear, the budget predicts after growth of just 2% this year, wages will grow by 2.5% next year, then 3% the year after that, then 3.5%, then 3.75% in 2020-21: And yet at the same time employment is expected to grow by a steady 1.5% and the unemployment rate is expected to fall only to 5.25%. It is the most hopeful prediction in the budget, and if that wages boom doesn\u2019t occur, then neither will the surplus. 3. Good debt bad debt? This was the budget to put the end to the evil of debt. It doesn\u2019t quite do that, but it does at least differentiate between debt incurred to fund recurrent expenses and that for capital expenditure. The suspicion was that reclassifying debt into the good and bad pile would see a big increase in infrastructure spending that would get explained away as \u201cgood debt\u201d. That didn\u2019t happen. The big infrastructure item of $5.3bn for the second Sydney airport is an equity investment and does not add to government spending in the budget as it is \u201coff budget\u201d. It appears the measure was mostly included to give credit ratings agencies a reason to keep the AAA credit rating. The budget reveals that the net operating balance will be in surplus a year earlier than the traditional \u201cunderlying cash balance\u201d: But the story Morrison really wants highlighted is that from 2018-19 onward the government will not be borrowing money for recurrent spending, but only for capital investments. The new measures also show that if you take out capital spending from within the net operating balance the picture looks even more rosy \u2013 with an \u201cadjusted net operating balance\u201d in 2020-21 of $24.6bn: I suspect that figure won\u2019t be given much attention \u2013 it does smack a little of combining figures just to come up with a story the government wants to tell. And the reality is debt needs to be paid off whether it is for capital spending or recurrent, and net debt is set to peak at 19.8% of GDP in 2018-19: At $375.1bn it will hit a level $214bn greater than that inherited by the Abbott government in 2013. But whether or not we\u2019ll talk about good or bad debt at the very least, this budget will put to bed the argument that the only way to return to surplus is by cutting spending. This is a budget that attempts to fill the revenue hole \u2013 a hole which, had revenue stayed at the pre-boom average, is the equivalent of around $377bn less revenue over the past nine years.",

      "bodyText": "Barclaycard and the British Retail Consortium have warned that a spurt in spending in April was the result of the late timing of Easter and said the growing squeeze on incomes meant the underlying trend in high street activity was weak. The two surveys found that rising inflation had resulted in consumers devoting an increasingly share of their pay packets on household essentials. Barclaycard said consumer spending was 5.5% up on April 2016 but added that the increase was mainly driven by supermarkets and petrol stations. It said spending on these essentials was up more than 11% year on year, the fastest rate of growth since it began releasing consumer spending data in 2012. Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard, said: \u201cA late Easter and rising prices provided a superficial boost to spending in April, but behind the headline figure it\u2019s clear consumers are recognising and responding to the inflationary pressures being placed on household budgets. Despite growth across a number of categories, the spending picture in real terms is one of growing caution, as seen by declining confidence levels amongst the UK\u2019s consumers.\u201d Consumer spending was boosted by the sharp fall in oil and other commodity prices in 2014 and 2015, which raised the real value of incomes by pushing the annual inflation rate to zero. But this trend has been reversed since the summer of 2016 through a combination of a rebound in oil prices and the rising cost of imports caused by the post-Brexit referendum drop in the value of the pound. Inflation has risen from 0.6% to 2.3% and is now running at the same level as the annual growth in average earnings. Further increases in inflation are expected over the coming months, despite the recovery in sterling against the US dollar from just above $1.20 to just below $1.30. Other recent data have indicated that consumers are no longer spending as freely as in the second half of 2016. Retail sales were 1.8% lower in March than in February, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said new car sales were almost 20% lower in April than a year earlier, while the Halifax said house prices in April \u2013 the start of the spring housebuying season \u2013 fell 0.1% and have now fallen \u00a33,000 from the peak reached last December. The latest data for consumer spending and the housing market comes ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s interest-rate setting meeting on Thursday. Threadneedle Street is expected to leave borrowing costs on hold at 0.25%. The BRC\u2019s chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the 6.3% rise in sales reported by her organisation was distorted by the timing of Easter. \u201cAs expected, the Easter holidays provided the welcome boost to retail sales, which goes some way to making up for the disappointing start to the year. That said, the positive distortion from the timing of Easter was largely responsible for the month\u2019s growth and looking to the longer-term signs of a slowdown, the outlook isn\u2019t as rosy. \u201cTaking a closer look at the sales figures, consumer spend on food and non-food items is diverging. Food categories continue to contribute the most weight to overall growth, although food inflation has a part to play in this. Meanwhile, consumers are being more cautious in their spending towards non-food products and focusing more on value-priced lines.\u201d Dickinson said that life was set to become more difficult in the high street, adding that Theresa May should make consumers a priority as she negotiates Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. \u201cAlthough today\u2019s figures do indicate that consumers are still willing to spend, with a cocktail of rising costs and slowing wage growth as the backdrop, conditions for consumers will get tougher. The next government needs to deliver a plan that puts consumers first in its economic policies and the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Amazon is moving into the live music business in the UK, running and promoting its own gigs starting with Blondie later this month. Amazon, which started selling tickets for shows, gigs and events for the first time two years ago, is once again using the UK to expand its music strategy with the launch of a new business called Prime Live Events. The US digital giant is using live gigs, which industry body UK Music says are worth about \u00a31bn a year to the economy, as the latest sweetener to attract customers to its Amazon Prime subscription service. The company is putting on gigs featuring major artists in smaller, intimate locations for subscribers, who pay \u00a379 a year or \u00a37.99 a month for services including online video and one-hour and same-day delivery of a wide range of products. First up is Blondie, who will be playing at the Round Chapel in Hackney, London, on 23 May, in a gig taking place 40 years to the week since the US band first played in the UK in Bournemouth. \u201cWe are excited to be performing at the first Prime Live Event marking 40 years since our first gig in the UK,\u201d said Blondie\u2019s lead singer, Debbie Harry. \u201cThe Round Chapel is an intimately warm and beautiful room allowing our fans to get up close and personal.\u201d Blondie will be followed by Alison Moyet on 12 June, also at the 750-capacity Round Chapel, which will include a pre-gig Q&amp;A session; Texas will play on 16 June at the Porchester Hall and Katie Melua will play in 25 and 26 July at Cadogan Hall. Each event will also be shown exclusively on Prime Video, Amazon\u2019s international film and TV service, globally. If the event strategy is successful it could be rolled out to other international markets \u2013 Amazon Tickets was launched in the UK and is expected to be rolled out to the US soon \u2013 and the number of gigs could be increased to as many as one a week. For Amazon, it is the latest initiative to try and make its subscription service as appealing as possible to existing customers and attract new subscribers. Amazon\u2019s most high-profile move to boost its appeal was to launch its own video service, competing against Netflix and traditional broadcasters, as part of its Prime subscription service. The company, which is estimated to spend more than $3bn on film and TV content annually, has invested huge sums in shows including The Grand Tour, the motoring show from ex-Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, and critically acclaimed fare such as Transparent, Mozart in the Jungle and the freshly launched American Gods. Other content available through the subscription service, which at \u00a37.99 a month costs the same as Netflix which offers just TV and film, includes 2m songs and one free Kindle book a month. Amazon is secretive about the numbers of Amazon Prime members, and therefore whether its huge investment in extra services is paying off, but analysts at Ampere estimate that there are about 5 million Amazon Prime subscribers in the UK. It is thought to have almost 4 million users of its video service. Globally, IHS Markit estimates that Amazon has 75 million to 80 million subscribers to Prime, with almost 50 million of those in its home market the US, with perhaps 30 million using its video service. \u201cThe expectation is that video is driving the overall Prime subscription base,\u201d said Tom Morrod, analyst at IHS Markit, who expects Amazon to hit 40 million video users by the end of 2017. Earlier this year Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, was named in Billboard magazine\u2019s top 100 list of the most powerful people in the music industry, driven by the potential for Alexa, its voice-operated \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d. Last year, Amazon UK ran pilots of its new live gig strategy featuring Robbie Williams and John Legend.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Few boards of large public companies get to reject three unsolicited offers from the same bidder, especially if the last one is worth 50% more than the old share price. By that stage, predatory hounds from the world of fund management have usually chased down the directors and forced a surrender in the name of greater shareholder value. So congratulations are due to AkzoNobel, the Dutch firm that bought ICI in 2007 and has owned paint-maker Dulux ever since. It has dismissed US rival PPG\u2019s latest takeover pitch, which is worth \u20ac26.9bn (\u00a323bn), and told the bidder, more or less, to take its chances with a hostile offer or shut up and go away. It has done so with a flourish, citing four grounds for refusal, from the value of the offer to PPG\u2019s \u201clack of cultural understanding\u201d. That phrase is likely to anger the already-irate faction among Akzo shareholders that wants to call an extraordinary meeting to oust chairman Antony Burgmans. They will follow PPG\u2019s line that Akzo\u2019s refusal to negotiate flows from a \u201clack of proper governance\u201d in the Dutch boardroom. The rebellious bunch, led by hedge fund Elliott, should calm down. Far from defending independence blindly, Akzo\u2019s board has done what it is supposed to do. It has drawn up a self-help plan that involves selling or spinning off the specialty chemicals division and describing how profit margins in the paints and coatings business can be improved by a quarter by 2020. Of course, Akzo chief executive Ton B\u00fcchner is open to the charge that he was dozing until PPG turned up. But the same applied at Unilever, which has been in shareholder-friendly overdrive since it saw off Kraft Heinz and appears invigorated by its brush with an aggressive US cost-cutter. Akzo\u2019s financial promises lack the full credibility of Unilever\u2019s, it should be said, but they boost the standalone story. There is now some hope that Akzo could reach \u20ac96 a share \u2013 the value of PPG\u2019s cash-and-shares offer \u2013 under its own steam within a few years. The starting-point, think analysts, would not be the former sub-\u20ac50 share price if PPG scarpers, but somewhere around \u20ac70. And, yes, Azko is right to shout about \u201ccultural differences\u201d and the interests of \u201cstakeholders\u201d. Shareholders should not be the only voices that are heard in takeover battles. Employees and Dutch politicians are virtually united in wanting Akzo to stay independent. That\u2019s not just because PPG is promising its own shareholders $750m of cost savings, which would presumably mean heavy job losses in Akzo\u2019s global workforce of 46,000, but also because the Dutch firm has a decent record of honouring its investment pledges. In the UK, note, Akzo is seen as being a good owner of the old ICI assets. PPG could yet go hostile and win, so Akzo\u2019s independence is not guaranteed. But Theresa May, if she is still contemplating tightening the UK takeover code, as she once promised, should follow events keenly. The stricter Dutch code does not forbid unwanted bids, and not all UK companies are powerless, as Unilever (which is actually Anglo-Dutch) and AstraZeneca have shown. But the Dutch system does seem to give boards more confidence to take a wide view of a company\u2019s interests and to resist the sell-first mantra of takeover lobbyists. The UK, with or without Brexit, could do with companies with Akzo\u2019s fighting spirit. Energy price cap: the devil\u2019s in the detail \u201cThere is only one factor driving it [Centrica\u2019s share price] to where it is, and that is the uncertainty about what the Conservative government might do to the energy supply market,\u201d Iain Conn, chief executive of the owner of British Gas, told one frustrated shareholder at Monday\u2019s annual meeting. That\u2019s fair comment. Centrica\u2019s shares were already weak but only dived back towards a multi-year low of 200p when the Tories came out in favour of a price cap. But what form of price cap? Conn is not the only one who wants to see the details. The Tories\u2019 aim is clearly directed towards standard variable rates, but neither possible technique for capping prices is straightforward. Under a relative price cap \u2013 meaning limiting standard variable rates to within a few percentage points of fixed-price tariffs \u2013 it is possible that bills could increase, at least for the 30% of active switchers. The cheapest deals in the market are already evaporating. Alternatively, a blunt cap on variable rates would involve ministers taking direct responsibility for energy bills. They would use regulator Ofgem as a buffer, but few will be convinced when bills increase, as they would sometimes when the wholesale market shifts. Neither of those outcomes seems politically palatable. No wonder the Tories have spent so much time talking up the proposal and so little in describing the implementation details. Monday night\u2019s supposed clarification still left important details in the air.",

It has drawn up a self-help plan that involves selling or spinning off the specialty chemicals division and describing how profit margins in the paints and coatings business can be improved by a quarter by 2020. Of course, Akzo chief executive Ton B\u00fcchner is open to the charge that he was dozing until PPG turned up. But the same applied at Unilever, which has been in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/06/unilever-flora-stork-kraft-heinz-bid\">shareholder-friendly overdrive</a> since it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/19/kraft-heinz-unilever-shareholders-lobbies-uk-government-takeoverbid\">saw off Kraft Heinz</a> and appears invigorated by its brush with an aggressive US cost-cutter.</p> <p>Akzo\u2019s financial promises lack the full credibility of Unilever\u2019s, it should be said, but they boost the standalone story. There is now some hope that Akzo could reach \u20ac96 a share \u2013 the value of PPG\u2019s cash-and-shares offer \u2013 under its own steam within a few years. The starting-point, think analysts, would not be the former sub-\u20ac50 share price if PPG scarpers, but somewhere around \u20ac70.</p> <p>And, yes, Azko is right to shout about \u201ccultural differences\u201d and the interests of \u201cstakeholders\u201d. Shareholders should not be the only voices that are heard in takeover battles. Employees and Dutch politicians are virtually united in wanting Akzo to stay independent. That\u2019s not just because PPG is promising its own shareholders $750m of cost savings, which would presumably mean heavy job losses in Akzo\u2019s global workforce of 46,000, but also because the Dutch firm has a decent record of honouring its investment pledges. In the UK, note, Akzo is seen as being a good owner of the old ICI assets.</p> <p>PPG could yet go hostile and win, so Akzo\u2019s independence is not guaranteed. But Theresa May, if she is still contemplating tightening the UK takeover code, as she once promised, should follow events keenly.</p> <p>The stricter Dutch code does not forbid unwanted bids, and not all UK companies are powerless, as Unilever (which is actually Anglo-Dutch) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/26/pfizer-abandons-attempt-astrazeneca-pharmaceutical\">AstraZeneca have shown</a>. But the Dutch system does seem to give boards more confidence to take a wide view of a company\u2019s interests and to resist the sell-first mantra of takeover lobbyists. The UK, with or without Brexit, could do with companies with Akzo\u2019s fighting spirit.</p> <h2>Energy price cap: the devil\u2019s in the detail</h2> <p>\u201cThere is only one factor driving it [Centrica\u2019s share price] to where it is, and that is the uncertainty about what the Conservative government might do to the energy supply market,\u201d Iain Conn, chief executive of the owner of British Gas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/08/british-gas-owner-axe-1500-jobs-warns-energy-price-caps\">told one frustrated shareholder</a> at Monday\u2019s annual meeting.</p> <p>That\u2019s fair comment. Centrica\u2019s shares were already weak but only dived back towards a multi-year low of 200p when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/24/conservative-energy-bill-cap-dents-company-share-prices\">Tories came out in favour of a price cap</a>. But what form of price cap? Conn is not the only one who wants to see the details.</p> <p>The Tories\u2019 aim is clearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/may/08/theresa-may-to-promise-price-cap-on-energy-bills-in-tory-manifesto\">directed towards standard variable rates</a>, but neither possible technique for capping prices is straightforward. Under a relative price cap \u2013 meaning limiting standard variable rates to within a few percentage points of fixed-price tariffs \u2013 it is possible that bills could increase, at least for the 30% of active switchers. The cheapest deals in the market are already evaporating.</p> <p>Alternatively, a blunt cap on variable rates would involve ministers taking direct responsibility for energy bills. They would use regulator Ofgem as a buffer, but few will be convinced when bills increase, as they would sometimes when the wholesale market shifts.</p> <p>Neither of those outcomes seems politically palatable. No wonder the Tories have spent so much time talking up the proposal and so little in describing the implementation details. Monday night\u2019s supposed clarification still left important details in the air.</p>",
