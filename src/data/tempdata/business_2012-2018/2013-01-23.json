Hilco, the restructuring company, is the frontrunner to buy up HMV from administrators. It acquired the entertainment chain's \u00a3120m of debt for \u00a340m, giving it effective control of the company as it is able to block any rival bids. But Hilco is only expected to want about half of HMV's stores and so the property consultants CBRE and Savills have been brought in to help offload potentially unwanted sites. They are expected to examine offers for the stores in 10 days' time. Morrisons has 12 convenience stores at the moment and wants to open at least 50 more this year as it races to catch up with rivals. It is also rumoured to be looking at Blockbuster stores after the retailer went into administration last week.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nouriel Roubini, the economist dubbed \"Dr Doom\" for predicting the credit crunch, has sounded a stark warning about the long-term effects of relying on quantitative easing to keep crisis-hit western economies afloat. At a lively debate in Davos, Roubini, who runs a New York-based consultancy, said central bankers risked saddling the economy with debt-burdened banks, businesses and consumers that should have been allowed to go bust. \"Over time, you get zombie banking, zombie corporates, zombie households, which is damaging in the long term,\" he said. The phrase \"zombie banks\" was coined in Japan, to describe insolvent lenders propped up by cheap cash. Roubini stressed that \"QE\" had been critical in fending off a new Great Depression after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. But, asked to argue against the motion, \"The short-term benefits of QE outweigh the long term risks,\" he offered nine reasons why such unconventional monetary policy could damage the economy in the longer term. Roubini went head to head with Adam Posen, the outspoken former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, who pushed for an extension of QE during his time in Threadneedle Street. Posen said central bankers should be \"humble\" about what they can achieve but there was no evidence from the past five years that QE was sowing the seeds of a future crisis. And in response to the increasingly widely aired argument that QE could lead to a Japanese-style economic stagnation, he said: \"If you look accurately at the data, being Japan wasn't so bad: in the five years to 2007, per capita growth in real GDP was higher than anyone else in the G8.\" Instead, Posen said opposition to QE in the current circumstances could only come from a \"deep spiritual belief that somehow this must create inflation\". However, Roubini argued that even if the policy was beneficial today, there could be unintended consequences if central bankers misjudged their \"exit strategy\". He was critical of the Federal Reserve's recent promise to keep buying bonds until unemployment sinks to 6.5%, for example, saying that policymakers may have misjudged how far the jobless rate can fall without sparking inflation. Roubini also warned that the more unconventional central bankers' approach becomes, the more they are jeopardising the inflation-targeting regime that has served the world well over the past 20 years. \"You've got QE2, QE3, soon you'll have QE infinity: what's going to happen to the regime of monetary policy? Most countries had inflation targeting; now the UK is talking about throwing it away: what's going to be the new anchor? How are we going to anchor people's expectations of inflation over time?\" Mark Carney, who will take over as Bank of England governor this summer, has floated the idea of a \"nominal GDP\" target, that could force central bankers to take more aggressive action to boost growth, and George Osborne has also expressed interest in the idea. Economists are divided about the lessons that should be learned from the response to the crisis of the past five years \u2013 and how quickly the world's central banks should start withdrawing the emergency measures they have been using to contain the impact of the financial crisis and its aftermath. In the UK, the minutes from the latest meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, published on Wednesday, showed that one of its nine members \u2013 David Miles \u2013 would still like to see QE extended further, by another \u00a325bn. However, Sir Mervyn King warned in a speech on Tuesday night against relying too heavily on central bankers to rebuild the battered UK economy. In Davos on Wednesday, despite Roubini's prohecies of doom, the clash of economists ended up with more than 60\u221e of the audience of policymakers and academics backing Posen, and agreeing that the short-term benefits of QE are worth the long-term risks.",

After the HMV, Comet and Jessops closures and a sharp decline in manufacturing over recent months, the government is braced for figures on Friday that are expected to show the UK halfway towards a triple-dip recession.

      "bodyText": "Britain is heading for a fifth year of falling living standards, with official figures showing a decline in average earnings growth last year from 1.7% to 1.4%. Unemployment fell and the number of people in work reached a record level in the three months to last November, but employers kept a lid on pay rises. Economists warned that with inflation at 2.7% and likely to stay above 2%, workers faced a squeeze on their finances that would send more retailers to the wall and restrict the economy's recovery. The gloomy prognosis was underlined by plans from Lloyds Bank and regional airline Flybe to shed over 1,200 jobs. After the HMV, Comet and Jessops closures and a sharp decline in manufacturing over recent months, the government is braced for figures on Friday that are expected to show the UK halfway towards a triple-dip recession. Unions criticised Lloyds, which they said had announced 1,300 job cuts in the past few days and a quarter of its workforce since 2009. Ministers welcomed the unemployment figures, which also showed a further dip in the numbers claiming jobseeker's allowance.

But economists warned that the downturn in the manufacturing sector in the runup to Christmas and the bloodbath on the high street would reverse the trend in the coming months.

We may discover on Friday that the UK is halfway into a triple-dip recession. At the same time, the real weather may be slowing activity in the current quarter. Meanwhile, the government is resigned to missing one of its original debt-reduction targets. In the wings, the credit rating agencies chunter about removing the UK's triple-A rating. Their bark may turn out to be worse than their bite, but you never know \u2013 we're not the US, after all. Then there's the euro factor. Currencies don't rise or fall in a vacuum and the pound's decline is also a story of euro strength. That's the Mario Draghi effect at work. By saying last summer that the European Central Bank would do \"whatever it takes\" to save the single currency, the ECB president appears to have persuaded investors that euro waters are safe again. Indeed, Draghi now seems untroubled by any thought that his success makes life tougher for eurozone exporters; it is hard to detect any serious attempt by the ECB to talk down the euro. By contrast, Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, reflected this week on the 25% fall in the value of the pound between late 2007 and early 2009 and noted that it had helped to close the gap between exports and imports from 3.5% of GDP to 1.5%. He added: \"The persistence of the current account deficit is evidence that an adjustment of sterling of that order was certainly necessary for a full rebalancing of our economy.\" It doesn't sound as if sterling's current trade-weighted exchange rate makes him too unhappy. The danger comes if things get out of control. A weaker sterling forces up the price of imported goods, squeezing real incomes further and potentially undermining any thoughts at the Bank of engaging in further bursts of quantitative easing. And the real nightmare would be a buyers' strike in the gilt market, where overseas investors own about a third of the total stock of debt. In reality, those serious dangers still seem some way off. Indeed, the yield of 10-year gilts dipped back below 2% yesterday, having been 2.1% a fortnight ago. But are they warning signs? Yes.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Poor Jamie Dimon: as CNBC warmed the audience up for Wednesday's Davos debate on \"the global financial context\", the JP Morgan boss was forced to sit unflinching through an ear-splitting video montage of Wall Street's misdemeanours, including the so-called \"London Whale\" farrago that saw his bank 'fess up to having lost $6bn (\u00a33.77bn) after several London traders made hugely risky bets in what was meant to be a relatively conservative corner of the bank. True to pugnacious form, Dimon came out fighting. He took on Paul Singer, the hedge fund manager who has been critical of banks' opaqueness and complexity, denying that there is anything about JP Morgan's balance sheet that the public \u2013 or the regulators \u2013 can't find out from reading the information it discloses. \"You don't know how aircraft engines work, either!\" he shot back at Singer. But his analogy, comparing a finely tuned jet and a vast multinational bank, is a cheeky one, to say the least.

First there was denial. Then there was panic. Then there was hope that the worst was over. Now there is nagging doubt, concern that this downturn simply won\u2019t come to an end.</p> <p>Each year the consultancy firm PWC conducts a survey of the great and good of the business world. The message this year is that the improvement in sentiment seen in 2011 and 2012 has stalled. As far as business confidence is concerned there is a global double dip recession.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to see why. Everywhere executives look there are problems: real or prospective. In Europe, it is the impact of austerity programmes on growth and the frightening levels of joblessness. In India, it is inflation. In the United States, it is the fiscal cliff. In Japan, it is the prospect of a global currency war triggered by Tokyo\u2019s attempts to drive down the value of the yen.</p> <p>David Cameron has done his bit to add to the uncertain mood. Announcing that Britain will have an in-out referendum on membership of the European Union in 2017 ensures four years in which foreign companies will be hesitant about investing in Britain.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the PWC report shows that expectations about strong growth in 2013 are highest in the emerging world and lowest in Europe and Japan, where recent performance has been weak.</p> <p>But Dennis Nally, chairman of PWC International, said executives remained cautious about their short-term prospects and the outlook for the global economy. Far from planning for a robust global recovery, there is evidence that companies are hunkering down: concentrating on cutting costs and making themselves more efficient.</p> <p>This matters. Many businesses are cash rich after laying off staff, mothballing investment and keeping the lid on wages, but the PWC report suggests they are in no hurry to invest their accumulated reserves.&#xa0;</p> <p>This also comes as no surprise. Businesses will only invest if they perceive growing demand for their goods and services. But the dilemma for the CEOs gathered in Davos is that the policies they have championed in the past \u2013 fiscal austerity, weaker trade unions, aggressive cost cutting \u2013 have hammered consumer spending. In the past, spending could be supported by rising household debt, but the banks don\u2019t want to lend and the consumers don\u2019t want to borrow.</p> <p>This is a recipe for continued economic torpor. Three things would help: fixing the banks; a reining back of austerity and a new social compact to ensure that productivity gains are once again shared by capital and labour.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/22/davos-2013-british-bosses-downbeat-survey\">More from Larry: British CEOs among world's most downbeat</a></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-35e585d4-86e8-43e3-a490-cca1730346db\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/14/1350250640381/Larry-Elliott-in-North-Ca-009.jpg\" alt=\"Larry Elliott \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-01-23T10:40:34.019Z\">at 10.40am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50ffa33995cb78836619ab6a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-23T08:45:45.971Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Number10gov/status/294002404263866368\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I believe that Britain should want to remain in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23EU\">#EU</a> so the European Union should want us to stay <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23EUspeech\">#EUspeech</a></p>&mdash; UK Prime Minister (@Number10gov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Number10gov/status/294002404263866368\">January 23, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kamalahmed1/status/294002472756850688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>David Cameron and Europe, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Davos\">#Davos</a> response: \"Anything that adds to that uncertainty is disruptive,\" Ian Powell, PWC chairman</p>&mdash; Kamal Ahmed (@kamalahmed1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kamalahmed1/status/294002472756850688\">January 23, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ffa1adb579891e074c8466\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-23T08:39:09.730Z\">8.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cameron: 'It'll be an in or out referendum'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We will give the people of the UK a very simple question: \"In or out of the European Union\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I say to the British people: this will be your decision.</p> <p>And when that choice comes, you will have an important choice to make about our country\u2019s destiny.</p> <p>I understand the appeal of going it alone, of charting our own course.

      "bodyText": "The cream of Davos are scattering into the night, which is looking cold and slippery. Better not risk blogging from treacherous pavements, so we're signing off until tomorrow morning. Goodnight! GW Asked for her biggest challenge in 2013, Lagarde says: Keeping the momentum. In summary - Christine Lagarde says that the world can climb away from its recent ills to a better future, if leaders can embrace the values and principles of openness and collaboration at a new moment in history. She's talking about a big new vision -- taking the opportunity provided by the easing of the financial crisis to build a new system based on proper values. Big stuff -- and it'll take more than one Davos speech to get there. But it's interesting to hear the IMF chief discussing such visions, rather than the nitty gritty of a bailout package. Future generations will be roasted, toasted, fried and grilled unless world leaders get a grip on climate change, says Lagarde. And her fourth priority for the future -- accountability. That includes accountability in the financial sector - cleaning up elements such as shadow banking. Lagarde is urging policymakers to do more to tackle inequality - again citing Malala Yousafzai and the Indian gang rape victim as proof. She cites unemployment as a vital issue for many countries, and makes a particular point about female unemployment. The evidence is clear - when women do better, economies do better. Policymakers should do more to help women enter the economy, she adds. The generational divide is also cited -- the need to care more about the legacy being left. Lagarde cites the West's high debt-to-GDP ratio as a terrible burden for the young (and those yet to come) Lagarde is outlining just how much the world has changed in recent years, and about how much more change is heading our way. She cites the \"openness, inclusiveness and accountability\" that young people hold valuable - we can all learn from that she says. She also points to the huge popularity of social networks -- saying Facebook's userbase would make it the third biggest country in the world. Twitter would be fourth. Here's some more highlights: IMF chief Christine Lagarde begins by repeating her slogan from earlier today - about how the world must avoid a relapse and mustn't relax. She cites the US debt ceiling spat, and unfinished work in the eurozone. Now it's Christine Lagarde to speak. She begins by dedicating her speech to \"two girls\" -- Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistan school girl who nearly died in an Taliban attack last year, and \"her Indian sister\" - the 23-year-old student who died following a gang rape attack last December. Monti has fine comic timing. Asked about his efforts to attract foreign investment to Italy, he says that he asked a Qatari leader once why he did not invest in Italy... His reply was one word - corruption. I was shocked, partly because this wasn't the King of Norway talking.... Crumbs. Mario Monti has weighed in on David Cameron's announcement today that Britain will hold a referendum on EU membership. He said: I hope that if there is a referendum one day, UK citizens will decide to stay within Europe and help shape it. The EU does not need unwilling Europeans We desperately need willing Europeans. Monti added that he was pleased that Cameron plans to ask a clear question - In or Out - rather than a woollier one. That means all the relevant details costs and benefits will come out, he said: And that leads to a decision that is in the benefits of all citizens. Monti's advice to other leaders -- you can only implement tough reforms if you have the vision and commitment to repel demands from special interests. Now Monti praises Mario Draghi for his work at the ECB - and his programmes to stabilise the eurozone, He argues, though, that such schemes only worked because Italy was already making its own efforts to rebuild confidence Monti is speaking in front of the World Economic Forum, but he seems to be addressing the Italian electorate too -- reminding them of the mistakes of the past. Just one month until Italy's general election, of course. Moving onto the meat of his speech, Monti is roasting Silvio Berlusconi for mishandling the Italian economy (without actually naming his rival). Monti says that he has governed with \"the belief that leadership is the opposite of short-termism\", and says previous Italian government wasted the opportunity provided by a primary surplus. He dubs this: promising reforms and ending up with taxes, and debt, and a sovereign debt crisis. Monti goes on to \"pay tribute\" to Italy's citizens for their contribution during a 'difficult time' for the country. Italy, Monti says, has won people's confidence in its ability to bounce back. He says the investors he's been meeting at Davos today have also shown more confidence in his country. Monti begins by thanking the Davos team for 'honouring' Italy with this keynote speech, and that he realises it's not just a courtesy to a 'departing prime minister' (not, of course, that we'll wave goodbye to him after next month's election). Davos founder Klaus Schwab introduces Mario Monti, saying he rescued Italy from the brink of disaster, and inviting him to share his view of Europe's future. And he's here.... Hundreds of people have now assembled in the Davos Congress Hall for another set-piece event -- a speech from Mario Monti. First, Davos founder Klaus Schwab is doing a little speech, welcoming the Davos \"family\" together again, and making newcomers stand up for a special round of applause.. Markets across Europe have now closed for the day. FTSE 100 up 18 points at 6198 France's CAC down 17 points at 3724 Germany's DAX up 11 points at 7707 Spain's IBEX down 19 points at 8613 Italy's FTSE MIB 137 points at 17579 As we start to gear up for the highlight of the day - Christine Lagarde's speech at 5:10pm, some cynicism appears to be setting in. David Enrich, the Wall Street Journal's European banking editor tweets According to Politicshome's Paul Waugh, Downing Street has been hinting at what David Cameron could say during his Davos speech tomorrow. He tweets Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has some more reaction to David Cameron's EU speech. He writes: The Confederation of British Industry is mindful of the fact that its membership has widely different views about Europe, is adopting a cautious approach to Cameron's speech. Sir Roger Carr, the CBI's president said in Davos that: The tone, the style and the emphasis of the speech, which was positive about European membership, was good news. But the referendum builds in a degree of uncertainty and business never welcomes uncertainty. Managing that change is something business and government has to do. We have to demonstrate to our partners in Europe that this is a positive approach and that we making changes for everybody's benefit in Europe in terms of greater competitiveness and higher productivity. The press conference ended after Soros argued that austerity \"demanded\" a new approach to drugs policy, as incarceration was more expensive than alternative approaches. President Molina had tee'd up his message to Davos last weekend, in this interview with the Observer in which he explained that the debate had to move from morality to science. GW Here was Graeme's view at the press conference. Meanwhile, fellow hacks attempt to remain professional around the business colossus George Soros and Perez Molina, the president of Guatamala, are calling for an end to the War on Drugs, at a joint press conference at Davos. Announcing a summit meeting on the drugs problem in Guatamala in June, Molina declared that world leaders must rethink there approach to drugs. Prohibition, this War on Drugs, has seen cartels grow, and the results are not what we looked for. Soros threw the weight of his Foundation behind Molina's plan, saying the world has its best opportunity in 20 years to achieve a profound change. Citing Mali, he added: Drug policy has endangered political stability and security in many countries, and not just in Latin America. He conceded though that he did not know the solution to tackling drugs, though treating it as an addiction problem was crucial. The press conference is continuing.... GW Ian Cheshire, the boss of B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, says he hopes the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU will \"put this to bed\". It is a good step forward. The prime minister is trying to shape the agenda rather than things happening as a result of drift and by default. LE More from Larry Elliott Phillip Jennings, General secretary of the global union UNI, said it was time for the G20 group of developed and developing nations to provide concerted stimulus as it did when the world economy was in deep recession in 2009. \"In 2009 there was a concerted effort to steer us away from the edge. In 2010 the austerity hawks took over, but they have not delivered financial stability, they have not increased investment and they have not stopped the haemorrhage of jobs.\" Jennings said it was time for a \"policy reset\", with action to create jobs and reduce inequality. Chief executives in Davos, he said, were waking up to the fact that it was \"impossible to cut their way to growth\". Companies could not make the double digit rates of return demanded by financial markets when growth was so low. \"There is no demand there. The share of wages is in decline, the link between wages and productivity has been cut and the social contract has been bust into a 1000 pieces\". There is rather a post-lunch lull at Davos, with some attendees squirrelled away in sessions ... and a platoon checking email in the lounge. A few have even moved onto the red wine - a bold call at this stage (sessions run till 10pm), and one that attracts a few envious glances from the press corps... GW Peter Sutherland, BP's former chairman and director general of the World Trade Organisation, is not a fan of Cameron's EU referendum speech. I am deeply disturbed. It's an appalling speech in my view. Seeking a new settlement for Britain is bound to create a great deal of uncertainty, which is not good for business. It will take years to negotiate, if there is one at all. He told Reuters. RN More from the ground in Davos from Heather Stewart. In a session on \"De-risking Africa\", with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and South African President Jacob Zuma, the straight-talking executive chairman of brewer SABMiller, Graham Mackay, told governments, \"business will fix it, if it's allowed to.\" He urged them to rebuild crumbling infrastructure, strengthen the rule of law, and \"trust in economic growth to solve the problems of the continent: economic growth comes from the private sector\". Tony Blair has attacked Cameron's decision to hold a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU in an interview on Sky. RN Blair has also speaking on the BBC's World at One. \"[A referendum on EU membership] is a worry to any of us who have been through the European mill because right now these other European countries are in a very, very difficult state themselves. I hear what you say about this is a great negotiating tactic. But it reminds me a bit of the Mel Brooks comedy, Blazing Saddles, where the sheriff holds a gun to his own head and says at one point, \"If you don't do what I want, I'll blow my brains out.\" You want to watch that one of the 26 don't just say, go ahead. Andrew Sparrow has all the details. Ever wondered about the history of the World Economic Forum, and why it's in a tiny Swiss town without an airport? Find the answers to all your questions here. RN This morning's Session on Russia, and the scenarios faced by the federation, was a clear signal to Moscow that the \"Davos community\" wants the pace of reform to pick up. The scenarios outlined \u2013 one where oil prices remain high, one where they fall \u2013 both led to the conclusion that more needs to be done now. Alexey Kudrin, professor at Saint Petersburg State University, warned that there are \u201cserious, negative\" signals coming from Russia's business community. He outlined a scenario where falling oil prices send Russia's budget forecasts off-track, forcing the government to hike taxes and slash spending on social programmes, and freezing reform efforts. Russia should reform itself now, Kudrin argued, to negate the impact. Failure to make reforms will eventually mean a burden on businesses through higher taxes, and also hit small businesses and the middle classes. That leads to the stagnation of the Russian economy. Sergei Guriev, rector of the New Economic School, warned that a world of high oil prices could lead Russia to a deeper mess, as those in powers would be too complacent to maintain reforms. He said: That is not sustainable in the long term, as Russia's middle classes will demand reforms. They are too well-educated and too determined to enjoy increases in their quality of life [to not protest]. They will demand that the Russian government is less corrupt, and more accessible. Dmitry Medvedev, who sat through the arguments, wasn't convinced. He told Davos that Russia was already on track - and reminded them that they were even gloomier in 2008... I'll have the full story online shortly. GW Over at a talk on \"NGOs as new models for the 21st Century\" it sounds like some of the questions may have gone a touch off-topic. Journalist John Parnell tweeted from the hall: However, Paul Pugh, head of third sector services at global law firm Eversheds, has tried to steer the conversation back to more sensible grounds. He says: We are currently seeing two related trends: the transformation of the public sector into NGOs, such as social enterprises and mutuals, and private corporations using \u2018not-for-profit\u2019 vehicles... The root causes are varied but public sector austerity and increased consumer awareness through social media are undoubtedly major factors. It is vital that the legal governance models of these new NGOs are robust and provide accountability and transparency. A careful balance needs to be struck between giving key stakeholders a voice and appropriate rights while negating the risk of small, well organised self-interest groups from gaining too much influence. Lunchtime for your average Davos attendee means a stand-up buffet in the centre of the Congress Hall. The ability to juggle glass, plate and perhaps a pudding is essential for these occasions. Experienced (or perhaps greedier) hands are collecting a plateful of nibbly items (smoked salmon, smoked meats, cheese) and then queuing for the hot stuff - various meaty offerings, a noodle dish, and even some crab. Meanwhile, a jazz band serenade the troops. Alas, one of our party isn't a fan. Personally I can't cope with people talking over it. It's stretching my dynamic resilience.... GW Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor gives an overview of the reaction from Brussels to Cameron's announcement of an in-out referendum. He writes the biggest relief in Brussels and other EU capitals was that Cameron failed to spell out precisely what powers he wants to claw back from Brussels. The full article can be read here Which parties are you going to? Charlize Theron is hosting a celeb-filled bash in aid of The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria at the Kirchner Museum. Prince Andrew is hosting the UK reception at the grand Steigenberger Belvedere hotel tomorrow night. The hotel expects to serve 10,000 sandwiches and canapes washed down with 15,000 cups of coffee, 2,000 bottles of red wine, 1,600 bottles of white wine and 550 bottles of champagne. The WSJ has a full list of parties. RN Nouriel Roubini is having lunch with Sorrell RN Charlize Theron has been given an award for her humanitarian work. Theron, who won the best actress Oscar in 2004 for Monster, was honored by the World Economic Forum for her work fighting HIV among impoverished young people in South Africa, where she was born. There is an incredible brain trust in this room. I feel like I\u2019m getting smarter just by osmosis. Theron\u2019s appearance was a bit of a departure for the World Economic Forum, which had dialed back the celebrity glamour after an appearance in 2006 by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie threatened to overshadow the rest of the annual meeting. RN I wonder who the 22% are. RN Graeme says twitpic'ing from Medvedev's speech is banned. A modern Russia, etc. Peter Sands, CEO of Standard Chartered, has said the UK needs to remain part of the EU but said it was \"inevitable\" that referendum would happen. My feeling is that the UK needs to remain part of the EU. I completely understand why prime minister Cameron thought it necessary to offer the people a referendum. Europe is changing, and as the biggest country in Europe outside the euro zone, the UK's relationship with the eurozone is going to change. So I think it's kind of inevitable that something like this had to happen. The European Union has been a massively important creation within Europe. It is very good for the UK to be part of it. It will evolve. We have seen that already in the euro zone. It is changing quite markedly. It is not a bad thing to have the evolution, debates and questions. On the probability of the UK leaving the eurozone: It is probably quite unlikely. We're talking about a referendum being held sometime in the next parliament. A lot can happen between now and then in terms of the tenor of this debate. Watch his full interview with Bloomberg TV Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, has said he won\u2019t run against President Vladimir Putin in the next presidential election. \u201cI believe this wouldn\u2019t be correct,\u201d Medvedev said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Davos. \u201cI think that would be impossible.\u201d Medvedev stepped aside last year as president to allow the Kremlin return of Putin, who kept power as prime minister for four years because of a constitutional ban on three consecutive presidential terms. The next election is scheduled for 2018. Graeme Wearden is awaiting Medvedev's speech. RN German's foreign minister says the UK can't 'cherry pick' the bits of EU membership it wants. Germany wants the United Kingdom to remain an active and constructive part of the European Union... But cherry picking is not an option. RN Gunther Krichbaum, an ally of Angela Merkel's and head of the Bundestag european affairs committee. Cameron said, that he wants Britain to shape the future. How can you shape the future if you put the car in reverse while other regions of the world are on the fast lane? In a changing world, voices from Europe will only be heard if we join forces. As the African saying goes: If you want to travel fast, go alone. If you want to travel far, go together. More reaction to Cameron's speech on Andrew Sparrow's live blog. RN Larry Elliott is listening Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of advertising giant WPP, views on the EU referendum. It's all about swans. Why always swans..? Sorrell says the UK referendum is one of the five grey and black swans that could affect the global economy. A referendum adds to uncertainty it doesn't diminish uncertainty. \"I understand the PM's predicament. But a referendum creates more uncertainty and we don't need that. This is a political decision not an economic decision. If I am looking at it from WPP it isn't good news.\" Sorrell says Britain could \"say no and move out at precisely the wrong time\", when the tough measures being taken by the eurozone are bearing fruit. The WPP boss says other threats are the US fiscal cliff; the Middle East; the eurozone; and the performance of the leading emerging economies. Sorrell says the key to recovery is unlocking the $2tn sitting on company balance sheets.The objective of Davos, he says, should be to \"shake western economies out of their lethargy\". RN Touring the open spaces of the Davos halls, there's plenty of chatter about Britain's future in Europe. One popular theme is that the big worry is the City losing influence and power if the UK quit the EU. GW RN Guess how much it costs to go to Davos? Answer: $40,000 RN Sir Howard Davies also offered some support to David Cameron over his pledge today to give Britain a referendum over its EU membership: It's not a ridiculous strategy. If Cameron said there would not be a referendum then the Conservative party wouldn't tolerate it. A new deal with Europe based on a free-trade agreement is possible, Davies believes, as it would be in the EU's commercial interest. We have a large trade deficit, so why would they not agree? The big picture, he reckons, is that Britain's dysfunctional relationship with the EU will continue -- partly because of its decision not to join the euro, and partly because of its habit of piecemeal arguments over different elements of Europe rather than having a clear strategy. A referendum won't resolve anything. We will be semi-detached members of Europe whether we have the referendum or not. GW France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius doesn't seem fussed about Britain's referendum to leave the EU. \"If Britain wants to leave Europe we will roll out the red carpet for you,\" he told French radio this morning. The comment is a jibe on much-reported remarks by Cameron last year in which he offered to \"roll out the red carpet\" to French firms wishing to avoid high French corporate taxes by re-basing to Britain. Fabius repeated France's view that there could be no \"Europe a la carte\" in which a country picked which rules applied to it. \"Imagine we are a football club. You join the football club - but once you are in, you cannot say \u2018Let's play rugby',\" he added. RN Business confidence in the French manufacturing industry unexpectedly fell in January, according to ISEE data. The indicator for the industry dropped to 86 from 89 in December. It remains way below its long term average (100) and still indicates a contraction of industrial activity at the beginning of the year. The recent figures for this indicator are the lowest since the second half of 2009. RN Just grabbed a few minutes with Sir Howard Davies, who was rather scathing towards Europe's new Robin Hood tax, and rather supportive of David Cameron over his EU referendum. Davies (whose career included being director general of the CBI and director of the London School of Economics), reckons the Financial Transaction Tax is - on balance - not a great idea, and one that will hit the City hard. He told me: If the reason for a financial transaction tax is to get the banks to pay more tax, then yes I support it....but IMF research shows a balance sheet levy would be best. Davies suspects 'ulterior motives' behind the plan to put a levy on any transaction with 'one leg' in the eurozone \u2013 namely to increase eurozone tax revenues by milking the City of London. If our solution was a tax on cheese then the French would not be too happy about it, or sausages then the Germans wouldn't be too happy about it. GW Spain's GDP shrank for a sixth quarter. It contracted 0.6% in the last three months of last year, compared with 0.3% in the previous three months, new Bank of Spain figures show. It comes after prime minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019s government approved its fifth austerity package in a year to reduce the second-largest budget deficit in the euro area. Spain\u2019s 10-year bond yield fell 1 basis point to 5.1 at 9:55am in Madrid compared with an intraday record of 7.75% on July 25, before ECB President Mario Draghi said he would save the euro. Even so, Spain still pays 356 basis points more than Germany to borrow for 10 years. A record number of people are in work after another fall in unemployment and a further dip in the numbers claiming jobseeker's allowance, figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show. Almost 30 million adults were in a job in the quarter to last November, up by more than half a million on the previous year. The figure, giving an employment rate of 71%, is the highest since records began in 1971. Unemployment fell by 37,000 in the latest quarter to just under 2.5 million, the lowest since spring 2011. It was the 10th consecutive fall and was coupled with another cut in the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance, which was down by 12,100 last month to 1.56 million, the lowest since June 2011. The number of people classed as economically inactive, including those looking after a relative or who have given up looking for a job, fell by 13,000 to just over nine million. Part-time employment fell by 23,000, but this was offset by a 113,000 increase in the numbers employed full-time in the three months to November. Data from the Office for National Statistics also showed a 26,000 increase in the number of women out of work for up to six months, to reach 571,000, which may reflect changes to the benefits system resulting in more single mothers looking for work. RN Here's the text of Cameron's full speech Heather Stewart has more on Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, defence of banks. He argued that many banks have been 'ports in a storm,\" over the past five years. \"Finance is a critical part of how the economy functions,\" he said. \"If you're in a barter economy, there are no financial assets. Once a society starts to save, there are financial assets, and you want there to be financial assets. \"JP Morgan was not a fair weather friend: we were there in good times and bad times for everyone, including nations.\" In response to the claims of Paul Singer, of hedge fund firm Elliott Associates, who claimed the big banks are still too opaque and too complex, he insisted, \"companies can't be opaque; they're complex. You don't know how aircraft engines work either.\" Larry is at a session on the Global Energy Context, which describes the shale gas revolution in the US is the \"single most important economic development of the past two years\". The panel including Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, Robert Hormats, US undersecretary of state for economic, energy and agriculture, and Majid Jafar, MD of Dana Gas of the UAE, says cheaper energy in the US is the equivalent of a big tax cut for American consumers, providing them with more money to spend. US will be less dependent on the Middle East as it becomes more self-sufficient in energy but will still retain a strategic interest in the region, panellists say. RN Larry Elliott, the Guardian's economics editor, has sent over his thoughts from Davos Davos has been through some violent mood swings these past five years. First there was denial. Then there was panic. Then there was hope that the worst was over. Now there is nagging doubt, concern that this downturn simply won\u2019t come to an end. Each year the consultancy firm PWC conducts a survey of the great and good of the business world. The message this year is that the improvement in sentiment seen in 2011 and 2012 has stalled. As far as business confidence is concerned there is a global double dip recession. It\u2019s not hard to see why. Everywhere executives look there are problems: real or prospective. In Europe, it is the impact of austerity programmes on growth and the frightening levels of joblessness. In India, it is inflation. In the United States, it is the fiscal cliff. In Japan, it is the prospect of a global currency war triggered by Tokyo\u2019s attempts to drive down the value of the yen. David Cameron has done his bit to add to the uncertain mood. Announcing that Britain will have an in-out referendum on membership of the European Union in 2017 ensures four years in which foreign companies will be hesitant about investing in Britain. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the PWC report shows that expectations about strong growth in 2013 are highest in the emerging world and lowest in Europe and Japan, where recent performance has been weak. But Dennis Nally, chairman of PWC International, said executives remained cautious about their short-term prospects and the outlook for the global economy. Far from planning for a robust global recovery, there is evidence that companies are hunkering down: concentrating on cutting costs and making themselves more efficient. This matters. Many businesses are cash rich after laying off staff, mothballing investment and keeping the lid on wages, but the PWC report suggests they are in no hurry to invest their accumulated reserves. This also comes as no surprise. Businesses will only invest if they perceive growing demand for their goods and services. But the dilemma for the CEOs gathered in Davos is that the policies they have championed in the past \u2013 fiscal austerity, weaker trade unions, aggressive cost cutting \u2013 have hammered consumer spending. In the past, spending could be supported by rising household debt, but the banks don\u2019t want to lend and the consumers don\u2019t want to borrow. This is a recipe for continued economic torpor. Three things would help: fixing the banks; a reining back of austerity and a new social compact to ensure that productivity gains are once again shared by capital and labour. More from Larry: British CEOs among world's most downbeat We will give the people of the UK a very simple question: \"In or out of the European Union\". I say to the British people: this will be your decision. And when that choice comes, you will have an important choice to make about our country\u2019s destiny. I understand the appeal of going it alone, of charting our own course. But it will be a decision we will have to take with cool heads. Proponents of both sides of the argument will need to avoid exaggerating their claims. Of course Britain could make her own way in the world, outside the EU, if we chose to do so. So could any other Member State. But the question we will have to ask ourselves is this: is that the very best future for our country? He said the referendum will be held before the end of 2017 Meanwhile in London. Cameron has got to the core issue of his speech. I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue \u2013 shaping it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away. RN Heather Stewart is at the Dimon session The first big session of the day is underway, and it's a sellout. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, UBS chairman Axel Weber, Prudential CEO Tidjane Thiam, Min Zhu of the IMF, Paul Singer of Elliott Management and Andrey Kostin of Russia's VTB Bank are discussing the strategic shifts and transformations changing the global financial world. But its standing room only, and many potential listeners are now being turned away at the door.

It'll be live on the news channels, and you can also follow it on Bloomberg here RN 8am: Cameron's Europe speech 9:30am: UK December unemployment figures 9:30am: Bank of England minutes 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence figures RN The annual meeting is held across several buildings and hotels in Davos, (including a congress centre that may have been designed by the man behind the maze at Hampton Court). There are meetings and 'interactive sessions' all over the place - many, alas, aren't fully on-the-record (or even open to humble reporters).

Resilience is crucial, says WEF, because recovering from sudden shocks is crucial at a time of 'prolonged economic malaise\" and austerity. Still, it's not the most catchy rallying cry - and would probably work just as well as Dynamic Resilience. Anyway \u2026 can you think of a better slogan? GW Fear not eurozone crisis news junkies, while Graeme is bringing you the latest from Davos we will still be keeping on top of the latest developments in the UK and Europe. We'll also have live coverage of David Cameron's Europe speech over on Andrew Sparrow's live blog. His speech at Bloomberg's London HQ starts at 8am. RN Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the first day of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. It's a big day in the small Swiss resort of Davos. World leaders, chief executives, top economists and other heavy hitters and movers'n'shakers have descended for their annual get-together. We'll be following all the main developments through the day \u2013 tracking the key debates, interviews, discussions and power meetings as attendees get down to business. Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott and Observer business editor Heather Stewart are also here in Davos, helping us unravel and explain what's going on. (for clarity, we'll be adding our initials at the end of blogposts where appropriate). Let us know what you think, too.

He told the Observer last week that drug money had penetrated Guatemala's judicial system and security forces, and that he favoured a regulatory approach to drugs, rather than the extremes of a full-blown war on drugs or a policy of liberalisation. Yasmin Batliwala, chair of Westminster Drug Project, agreed that politicians must tackle the problem by helping users rather than punishing them. \"Drug dependency should be seen as a health and social problem, not a crime. Offenders with drug dependency and mental illness should be sent into treatment rather than to prison,\" she said. \"It is time to take drug dependency out of law enforcement and into the health framework, where it belongs. The war on drugs has failed and it is clear that we need a new approach at both a national and a global level.\" Soros admitted that he did not know what the best solution to the problem was. \"The answer will only be found by trial and error,\" he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 January 2013 because the original referred to the Berkeley Foundation where the Beckley Foundation was meant.",

    "webTitle": "Pound remains under pressure as it loses safe haven status", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound could face sustained pressure on the foreign exchange markets, experts warned on Wednesday, as David Cameron pledged to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU against the backdrop of a weak UK economy. Sterling had dipped to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly five months as Cameron spoke, although it bounced a little afterwards following the publication of data showing a fall in unemployment in the three months to December. But by setting out the case for Britain to remain in the 27-member union, the prime minister gave a small comfort to investors who have been selling out of sterling since the start of year and have made the UK currency one of the worst performers of any G10 country so far this year. Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, warned that sterling was facing an \"amber warning light\" after a 3.45% decline against the euro and 2.5% fall against the dollar in the first three weeks of the year. Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, said: \"The moves we've seen this year have been worthy of a lot of raised eyebrows. For sterling these are big moves.\" Foley said Cameron \"will have reassured the international business community about Britain's trade links with its main trading partners and will have reduced fears that the UK is on a course towards international isolation\". The publication on Friday of GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2012 will set the tone for sterling amid expectations that the economy will have contracted in the last three months of the year following a near 1% rise in the third quarter. While sterling gained ground against other currencies in 2012 as it was perceived to be a relative safe haven from the crisis in the eurozone, Walker said this consensus was \"fraying a bit\". \"We are seeing downward pressure on sterling. But are we in a currency crisis? No. It's an amber warning light,\" he said. The restoration of calm in the eurozone where periphery countries have returned to the bond markets of late \u2013 including Portugal \u2013 has enticed investors back into the euro, which in turn has weakened sterling. Foley believes this means that sterling is now \"exposed \u2026 to the full brunt of the UK fundamentals\". Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, a foreign exchange company, said that talk of \"currency wars\" \u2013 a phrase coined by Brazilian finance minister Guido Mantega in 2010 \u2013 had now resurfaced since Japan announced steps this week to weaken its currency by buying up its own debt. Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, on Tuesday warned that it could spark a new wave of devaluations of currencies as countries took steps to try to help their exporters. In a speech on Tuesday Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King also referred to \"currency wars\" as countries take efforts to close their trade deficits. The outgoing Bank of England governor also pointed out that the 25% fall in sterling since late 2007 and the beginning of 2009 had closed the gap between exports and imports in real terms from around 3.5% of GDP to around 1.5%. Economists believe that policymakers in the UK are still talking down sterling but that getting the slide to happen without undue haste was crucial. If sterling keeps falling at its current pace then Cook predicts a \"slow crisis\". But a sudden fall of 5% or 6% from current levels of $1.5860 and \u20ac1.19 (to $1.49 and \u20ac1.11) could be a cause for alarm. A currency price of \u20ac1.19 is the equivalent to around 84p to the euro. Walker at RBS said that while sterling was trading 10 cents either side of $1.60 it was trading at justifiable levels. But sterling has a long way to move if it is to return to pre-banking crisis levels, when it traded at $2 and \u20ac1.30 respectively.",

With the start of 2013 already witnessing a spate of job cut announcements across a variety of sectors this suggests that the rate of employment growth will slow in the coming months.

With inflation likely to hold stubbornly above the 2.5% mark for much or all of 2013, real earnings growth looks set to remain elusive, hampering consumer spending in the UK economy.

There are concerns that youth unemployment has not fallen, and that the improvement in men's position is greater than that for women. Regional disparities remain a big problem. Nevertheless, a positive picture, and one which suggests that the government is right not to listen to those who want it to reverse the policy of limited fiscal austerity. Instead it should press ahead with measures to deregulate the labour market and build on the trend shown in these figures.",
