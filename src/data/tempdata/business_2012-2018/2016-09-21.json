      "bodyText": "Confidence among small businesses plummeted after Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union to its lowest level for four years following concerns that the economy would slip into recession. But the loss of faith among SMEs could be shortlived after a modest recovery at home and abroad that is expected to result in most firms expanding over the next year. The Federation of Small Businesses said its survey for the three months to the end of August provided a mixed picture after the trepidation felt by firms at the outcome of impending Brexit negotiations was offset by the signs of a strong domestic demand and an increase in exports. Small business confidence fell into negative territory in the third quarter for the first time since 2012 after the number of business owners confident about the year ahead was outnumbered by those that were negative. The lobby group\u2019s small business index dropped for the third quarter in a row to -2.9, giving the second largest year-on-year fall in confidence in the index\u2019s history. But the report echoed similar business surveys that show that companies have started to set aside the dire warnings of the Treasury and International Monetary Fund of a likely downturn and are bouncing back from the Brexit vote. The FSB found many small firms reported greater access to finance, a rise in new employment and reduced spare capacity. More than half of firms said they expected to grow over the next six months and only 11% expected to shrink. Mike Cherry, the FSB chairman, said the low pound and the resilience of consumer demand had prevented a slump, though they only masked deeper issues limiting growth that would reassert themselves over the next six months. He said: \u201cThere is no doubt that the political shock of the Brexit result has taken place at a time of weakening business confidence. For the first time in four years, confidence is in negative territory. This persistent downward trend in UK business confidence reflects underlying issues that predate the Brexit decision.\u201d The report said firms may have \u201cpriced in\u201d the impact of the EU referendum result and were now looking for growth opportunities. \u201cSmall firms are resilient and will survive the current fragile economic outlook, but to avoid an economic slowdown this data should be a wake-up call for our elected politicians,\u201d he added. Cherry urged Philip Hammond to use his autumn statement in November \u201cto back infrastructure projects at local and national level, to simplify the tax system and to help reduce the costs of doing business\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "US politicians have accused the boss of drug company Mylan of attempting to get \u201cfilthy rich\u201d by \u201cjacking up\u201d the price of life-saving allergy treatment EpiPen. Speaking at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House committee on oversight and government reform, accused Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch of exploiting a strategy \u201cto find old cheap drug that has virtually no competition and raise the price over and over and over again as high as you can\u201d. Mylan has increased the price of a pair of EpiPens sixfold since it bought the treatment. Cummings said the company\u2019s tactic was to \u201cget filthy rich at the expense of our constituents\u201d. John Duncan, the Republican representative for Tennessee\u2019s second district, said the amount of money Bresch has personally made from soaring profitability of EpiPen was \u201csickening [and] disgusting\u201d. Bresch, the daughter of Democratic senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, was paid $18.9m last year, a 671% increase since 2007. \u201cI\u2019m a very conservative pro-business Republican, but I am sickened by what I have heard today,\u201d Duncan said. He said it was \u201cshaming\u201d that Mylan and Bresch were profiting \u201con the backs of sick children\u201d. Cummings said Bresch and Mylan would \u201ctake our punches, they\u2019ll fly back to their mansions in their private jets and laugh all the way to the bank while our constituents suffer, file for bankruptcy, and watch their children get sicker, and in some cases die\u201d. The committee has \u201cprice gouging\u201d pharmaceutical companies firmly in its sights, having previously grilled former hedge fund manager turned pharmaceutical boss Martin Shrekli, dubbed \u201cthe world\u2019s most hated man\u201d after he jacked up the price of a HIV-related drug by 5,000%. Bresch told the committee that she had not intended to make the life-saving allergy treatment unaffordable for families and wished that Mylan had \u201cbetter anticipated the magnitude and acceleration\u201d of the rising cost for patients. \u201cWe never intended this.\u201d \u201cYou never anticipated this? You raised the price, what did you think was going to happen?\u201d Jason Chaffetz, the Republican committee chairman, asked her at the hearing in Washington. Bresch said the company made only $50 profit per pen, which sells for $608 for a pack of two. She said the company would soon start selling a generic version of the EpiPen, which is used to treat life-threatening allergic reactions by delivering a dose of epinephrine through injection into the thigh. Chaffetz said Bresch\u2019s claims of limited profits were \u201ca little hard to believe\u201d. \u201cSuddenly feeling the heat, Mylan has offered a generic version and cut the price in half, so that does beg the question, what was happening with that other $300?\u201d he asked. Holding up an EpiPen, Chaffetz said: \u201cThe actual juice that\u2019s in here that you need costs about a dollar.\u201d Cumming said making the generic version wasn\u2019t good enough, and accused the company of using \u201cthe same PR playbook that other companies use\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s what Martin Shkreli did, that is what Valeant did, and that is what Mylan is doing,\u201d he said. More than 3.6m two-pack EpiPen prescriptions were filled in the US last year, according to data firm IMS Health. That equates to almost $1.7bn in sales, but Mylan said it made revenues of about $1.1bn after fees to distributors and others.",

    "webTitle": "Fed chair Yellen rejects Trump criticism after leaving US interest rates on hold \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Today\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting wasn\u2019t a shocker. But nor was it a complete damp squib. Instead, we saw a central bank inching towards raising interest rates, and running out of excuses for leaving them on hold today. Yellen gave an encouraging view of the US economy, saying economic activity has picked up, with solid job creation. But yet... \u201cThe economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought. That\u2019s good news....We don\u2019t see the economy is overheating now.\u201d Yellen even raised the risk of the US being dragged into recession, to justify laying it safe today Crucially, three policymakers think today was the day to move, and it seems likely that a majority will take the plunge in December. Indeed, November\u2019s meeting will be fascinating, if any more hawks emerge. Today\u2019s press conference also reflected the political battle raging outside. Yellen found herself forced to defend the Fed against Donald Trump\u2019s claims that political pressure has influenced monetary policy. She declared: We do not discuss politics at our meetings, and we do not take politics into account in our decisions. That could be a foretaste of the turmoil if Trump wins in November.... And that\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW. Ding Ding! The closing bell is being rung at the New York stock exchange. And shares have rallied pretty strongly, after the Fed left interest rates on hold and gave a fairly upbeat view of the US economy. The Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 have both gained almost 1%, as traders welcome the decision not to hike borrowing costs today. Tony Bedikian, Head of Global Markets at Citizens Bank, explains why: \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the Fed was not a surprise. It was the outcome that many market followers expected, but we are still seeing a bounce in equities because now the question has been answered. It was interesting to see the split vote with three members of the policy committee willing to break ranks and support raising rates. Fed policy makers have said all along that their decisions will be data dependent and their statement today indicates that the majority of committee members still don\u2019t feel the data is strong enough to tighten yet.\u201d Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, also predicts a rate rise before Christmas. But today, though, the economic picture simply wasn\u2019t good enough. \u201cAny expectation of a Fed rate rise in September unwound following weak economic performance in the third quarter. Stumbling growth in the economy, particularly in industrial production, was a significant counterbalance to the more hawkish sentiment displayed by certain members of the Fed earlier in the month. \u201cThe Fed is highly pragmatic though, and if wider data, including inflation, begins to mirror the strength of the labour market then they may be able to raise interest rates again before the year is up. In the meantime, as in the UK, investors continue to keep their eye on fiscal policy and carefully watch how this will develop as the cornerstone to long-term economic recovery.\u201d Reaction to the Federal Reserve meeting is coming in now... Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, says the US central bank has pulled off a \u201cHawkish hold\u201d today. With three policymakers voting to hike, as December rise looks likely. \u201cThat was about as hawkish a hold as you\u2019re ever likely to get from the Fed. Three dissenting voices is highly unusual for the US central bank policy team, and indicates just how close the FOMC is to raising rates. The fact that Mester, George and Rosengren all want to raise rates also points to some division and potentially a question mark over the authority of Janet Yellen. Interestingly she said the decision not to hike this month does not reflect a lack of faith in the US economy. Instead it looks like the Fed is simply being very cautious as it has a bit of slack in the labour market and inflation is not yet at target. Q: And finally.... when is America actually going to see some meaningful wage growth? Yellen offers some hope to hard-pressed workers. The Fed does expect the unemployment rate to decline, she says, and the labour market to improve. So: My hope and expectation is that we will see a pick-up in wage growth, that is broadly beneficial to US household. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. I\u2019ll pull a short summary together shortly. Some reaction to that last question: Asked about inflation expectations, Yellen says the Fed must be \u201cforward looking\u201d. No-one at the FOMC wants to allow inflation to overshoot badly. But we must also look at Japan as a reminder that inflation expectations can become un-anchored. Another question about Wells Fargo - what is the Fed going do to clean it up? Yellen says the Fed wants all banks, not just Wells, to have robust risk management systems to protect customers. Asked about leverage risks, Yellen says she\u2019s \u201cworried\u201d that bubbles could form in the US economy. But no-one knows for sure when a valuation turns into a bubble, she argues. Q: Does the Wells Fargo scandal imply that some banks are simply too big to manage and should be broken up? Janet Yellen says no - the key is that banks need to be run properly. Q: Has the Fed launched an investigation into the scandal at Wells Fargo? Yellen says this is a matter for other regulators (as it affected consumers, who were wrongly given phoney bank accounts and credit cards). But the Fed will be watching Wells Fargo closely, to ensure its top managers are obeying compliance rules. We have been \u201cdistressed\u201d to see these kinds of problems, she adds; banks need to ensure that their staff are acting ethically and protecting customers. Donald Trump is looming over today\u2019s press conference... Q: Are you worried that Trump could go back through the meetings of Fed meeting for signs that politics has influenced your decisions? No, Yellen replies, insisting again that politics does not play a role. Q: Is there a risk in leaving interest rates too low for too long? Yes, Yellen replies. But the bigger risk is to raise rates too soon. We could cause a recession in the process - that isn\u2019t something that I and my colleagues want to be responsible for. Q: Why did the Fed cite the Brexit vote as a key risk back in June, but hasn\u2019t cited the November elections as a risk today? Yellen won\u2019t be tempted with this curveball, saying simply that she won\u2019t comment on the US election. Two political questions... Q: Is political uncertainty weighing on US growth, in the run-up to November\u2019s election? Yellen says that investment spending has been weak recently, but she isn\u2019t exactly sure why. Consumer sentiment is \u201cperfectly solid\u201d, though. Q: Does the Fed want government spending to take more of the strain? There are ways that fiscal policy could help, Yellen replies, especially though \u2018automatic stabilisers\u2019 which would kick in during a slowdown. Q: Could interest rates rise at the next meeting, in November? Yellen confirms that the November meeting is \u2018live\u2019. A zinger of a question: Q: Donald Trump claims that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates artifially low for political reasons. What\u2019s your response? Yellen tries to sweeps the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s criticism aside. I can say emphatically that political issues play no part in the path of monetary policy, she insists. We do not discuss politics at our meetings, and we do not take politics into account in our decisions. Q: Is the Fed\u2019s credibility being hurt by the different briefings we\u2019ve heard from policymakers, with some hinting at rate hikes and others much more dovish? Yellen says there is less disagreement within the FOMC than you might think from recent speeches and comments. We do not suffer from \u201cgroup think\u201d, she adds; we are debating the issues around when to raise interest rates. Yellen is repeating her line about how there is a bit more \u2018running room\u2019 left in the economy, but an interest rate rise will probably soon be appropriate. Onto questions... Q: Aren\u2019t you just looking for excuses not to raise interest rates? We are pleased about the state of the US economy, Janet Yellen replies, citing the steady job creation in recent months. But people are still coming back into the labour market, she repeats, so there\u2019s no sign of \u201coverheating\u201d So.... The economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought. We don\u2019t see the economy overheating now. Yellen argues that US monetary policy stance is currently only \u201cmodestly accommodative\u201d. So there is little danger of dropping behind the curve by leaving interest rates on hold today. Policy is not on a pre-set course, she adds. And then she argues that by not raising rates too soon, the Fed cuts the risk of having to cut rates in the future. Yellen asks the question on everyone\u2019s lips - if the US economy is improving, why didn\u2019t they raise the federal fund rate? She insists that the Fed isn\u2019t worried about an economic slowdown. Instead, there is still \u201cscope for further improvement in the labour market\u201d. So with inflation below target, the Fed decided to leave rates unchanged and let more data flow in ... The Fed still expects inflation to rise to 2% in the next two-to-three years, Yellen continues. But the Fed can\u2019t take it for granted that long-term inflation expectations will remain well-anchored (ie, that American citizens will believe that inflation is actually heading back to target) Recent employment data shows that more people are coming back to the labour market looking for jobs, says Yellen. That\u2019s a very encouraging sign - but also means there is still some slack to mop up. Janet Yellen is giving a press conference right now! It\u2019s being streamed live here. The Fed chair confirms that the Fed believes the economy has strengthened, but left rates on hold. She says household spending has driven growth up, but business investment remains \u201csoft\u201d. Some snap reaction and analysis: Alhough the Federal Reserve resisted hiking rates, the US central bank does believe that the economic conditions are improving. Today\u2019s statement suggests that the economy is in decent-enough shape, but inflation is still too low to justify higher borrowing costs. The Fed says: (I\u2019ve bolded-up some parts) Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year. Although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid, on average. Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has remained soft. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. But... Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Wall Street has taken today\u2019s decision in its stride - shares are a little higher, and the dollar has dipped a little. But it\u2019s nothing serious. The Federal Reserve has also cut its interest rate expectations - now only expecting 1 rate hike this year (down from two in June). The Fed also expects rates to rise more gradually in 2017 and 2018, and cut its longer-run interest rate forecast to 2.9 percent from 3.0 percent. But yet....the Fed said the near-term risks for the economic outlook \u201cappear roughly balanced.\u201d This new dot chart shows how the Fed\u2019s policymakers expect rates to change of the next few years: The Fed has dropped a clear hint that it is close to raising interest rates - just not today. In today\u2019s statement, it says: \u201cThe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u201d. And 14 of the Fed\u2019s 17 policymakers expect at least one hike by the end of this year. Today\u2019s decision isn\u2019t unanimous! Three Federal Reserve policymakers voted to raise borrowing costs today. They are: Kansas City Fed President Esther George, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. BREAKING: The Federal Reserve has left interest rates unchanged at 0.25% to 0.5%. More to follow..... OK, nearly time for the most eagerly anticipated Central Bank decision since the Bank of Japan shook up its stimulus programme this morning :) We get the decision at the top of the hour, along with new economic forecasts. Then 30 minutes later, Fed chair Janet Yellen holds a press conference. It\u2019s been a nervous few hours on the New York stock market. The Dow opened higher, then slid into negative territory as Fed jitters gnawed away at traders. And now it\u2019s back where it started, up just 0.07%. This chart also shows how investors are positioning themselves for rates to be higher in three month\u2019s time. Anticipation is growing.... Just 30 minutes to go! And the markets reckon there\u2019s less than a one-in-four chance that the Fed will raise interest rates. Wall Street isnt\u2019 always right, of course. So you can expect some wild movements if Janet Yellen produces a surprise at 2pm Eastern Time (7pm in the UK). This chart shows how a September hike is a 22% chance, while rising to 31% in November, and then 59% for December. Here\u2019s a look at various probabilities for the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions and comments, courtesy of John Kicklighter, chief strategist at DailyFX: Ahead of the Federal Reserve press conference due in just under an hour and a half, here\u2019s the link to watch it live. After the Bank of Japan caught some observers by surprise with its new stimulus measures and boosted European markets, some of the gloss came off during the course of the day ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate decision. As we\u2019ve covered, most people believe the Fed will leave rates on hold, although there is still a chance it might catch markets on the hop with a surprise increase. And even if rates are left unchanged, investors will be looking for any hints from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen about when borrowing costs might rise. In Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, up just 3.98 points or 0.06% at 6834.77 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.41% to 10,436.49 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.48% to 4409.55 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB closed up 0.88% at 16,349.82 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.83% at 8758.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.27% to 562.12 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently pretty flat, up just 2 points. Markets are betting on a no-change statement from the Federal Reserve on US interest rates but will be keen to hear the tone of the central bank\u2019s comments, says strategist James Chen at City Index: Not much has changed from the past several weeks in terms of the very low expectations for a rate hike. If anything, [today\u2019s Bank of Japan] announcement of new easing measures could even further discourage a Fed move, but as it already stands, there are very few market participants that are betting on such a move to higher interest rates, at least for this particular Fed meeting. Key Fed speakers and major US economic data releases have alternately shifted the discussion from one side to another in the past few weeks. Some members advocated a rate hike this year, even citing the possibility of one occurring in September, while others, like Fed Governor Lael Brainard, cautioned against raising interest rates too quickly. Additionally, September has thus far seen a general deterioration of US economic data in the form of substantially worse-than-expected releases regarding employment (NFP), both the manufacturing and services industries (PMI), retail sales, and housing, that were all significantly worse than expected. The one potentially brighter spot for the Fed was the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reading for August, which showed that both headline and core prices increased by more than expected. Despite this more buoyant view of inflation, however, it is still unlikely to be enough to sway the Fed into action today. Amidst all of these economic data releases and Fed member speeches, the market\u2019s view of the implied probability of a rate hike today has continued to hover in the low-to-high teens. Of course, there could always be a surprise move, but the much more likely scenario will be a characteristically unmovable Fed. Therefore, the market\u2019s focus, as has consistently been the case from the beginning of the year, will be concentrated on the words emanating from the Fed statement as it relates to the indication of a possible rate hike in December and the potential pace of tightening going forward. The current market probability of a December hike remains around 60%. The key markets to watch today, as always, will be US equity markets, gold, and the US dollar, particularly US dollar/Japanese yen due the earlier Bank of Japan announcement. A more hawkish Fed today could lead to a rebound for the dollar/yen while a more dovish statement could lead to a further drop for dollar/yen towards the key 100.00 mark and below. Predictions of the economic gloom which would follow the Brexit vote seem to be wide of the mark, according to a new Guardian project tracking the state of play as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. As a reminder, the UK Treasury for one forecast dire consequences in the immediate wake of the vote: Unveiling the new Guardian project, Katie Allen writes: Fears that Britain will slide into a post-referendum recession have been allayed after a Guardian analysis showed the latest news on the economy has confounded analysts\u2019 gloomy expectations, with consumer spending strong, unemployment low and the housing market holding steady. The finding comes as a leading thinktank toned down its earlier dire warnings of economic turmoil for the UK and its neighbours in the event of a leave vote. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said prompt action by the Bank of England to cut interest rates had cushioned the blow from June\u2019s Brexit vote but it still believes the UK will suffer a sharp slowdown next year amid heightened uncertainty. Official figures on the state of the public finances, released on Wednesday, also showed little impact from the vote to leave the EU. Government borrowing was a touch higher than economists had expected in August, but was lower than a year ago in a boost to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he prepares to give his maiden autumn statement in November. Following the historic 23 June vote to leave the EU, analysts were quick to predict the UK economy would grind to a halt or even shrink. They warned businesses and households would stop spending because of job cuts, political uncertainty and a squeeze on living standards as the weak pound stoked inflation. But since the Bank stepped in with a package of measures to shore up the economy, much of the economic news has defied expectations and many analysts have toned down their post-referendum gloom. Now the picture of early resilience is bolstered in the first snapshot of post-referendum Britain in a new Guardian project that will track the economy as the Brexit talks begin and progress, and as more data on the economy becomes available. The first report is here: US crude stocks fell unexpectedly last week as producers reduced their output, helping oil prices extend their early gains. Crude inventories dropped by 6.2m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to expectations of an increase of 3.4m barrels. Gasoline stocks fell by a larger than expected 3.2m barrels, with analysts forecasting a 567,000 decline according to Reuters. But stocks of distillates - which include diesel and heating oil - increased by 2.2m barrels compared to forecasts of a 250,000 rise. Brent crude is now 1.35% higher at $46.50 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 1.95% at $44.91. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: Here we go again: What once was a much heralded and anticipated rate decision, the September FOMC meeting seems all but wrapped up at this point. The Federal Reserve will keep its main rate on hold at 0.25-0.50%, citing near-term, weak economic developments, yet insisting that enough progress has been made to warrant a rate hike at one of the upcoming meetings (hint: December, when the next SEPs are released). The key for the US Dollar today, however, is to what degree of confidence the FOMC has in the US economy, or simply, \u2018how quickly does the Fed think it will be able to raise rates next?\u2019 ...In actuality, rate expectations are completely muted for today and are sitting on the fence for 2016. This is the main source of risk for markets today. Should the FOMC choose to be headstrong and tear down conventional wisdom - a small possibility with two prime dealers coming out and calling for a rate hike - global markets will be shocked. But assuming the Fed plays it safe as it usually does, a lack of a rate hike may not hurt the US Dollar significantly. By suggesting that a rate hike is still \u201con the table\u201d in the near-term, and by laying out an interest rate glide path for next year calling for multiple rate hikes, then the Fed could help insulate the US dollar, plain and simple. It\u2019s starting to feel like a September-December 2015 redux. So what are the chances of a US rate rise? Ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, US markets are moving higher. Most investors expect the Fed to leave rates on hold, but this is by no means guaranteed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.4% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.36% higher and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.4% initially. European markets are holding onto their gains - albeit off their best levels - with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both climbing 0.6%. But the FTSE 100 is up just 0.15% or 10 points. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The FTSE has seen its gains roughly halve as the day has gone on, the early Bank of Japan stimulus excitement gradually waning as more and more analysts voiced their scepticism about the effectiveness of the measures Kuroda and co. announced this morning. The same thing has happened in the Eurozone, the DAX and CAC now both up around half a percent having surged by as much as 1% after the bell. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, has fired an epic Tweetstorm towards the Federal Reserve, explaining why they shouldn\u2019t hike. He argues that the US labour market is far from overheating, and that the Fed should be comfortable with inflation running over its 2% target for some time, following the current underrun (inflation is currently 1.1%). He also fears that a surprise hike tonight might unbalance the economy at a crucial moment, sending the dollar too high, and creating a mess the Fed can\u2019t fix.... Over in America, policymakers at the Federal Reserve have just begun today\u2019s monetary policy meeting. In five hours time, they\u2019ll announce whether they\u2019ve raised US interest rates for the first time this year. The financial markets are widely expecting the Fed to sit elegantly on its hands tonight - but perhaps drop a big hint to expect a December rate hike. But some investors, such as hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, fear that the markets are hopelessly addicted to easy money.... Some City cynicism about the BoJ\u2019s bold pledge to get inflation above target: Royal London Asset Management have kindly sent over their full reaction to the Bank of Japan (as flagged earlier). Trevor Greetham, their head of multi asset investing, says: \u201cThis is helicopter money in all but name and it is supportive of our overweight stance in Japanese equities. \u201cJapan has been suffering from excessive debt and deflationary pressure for longer than any other developed market, so we should watch new policy developments in Tokyo with interest. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement makes it clear that the authorities are going down the route of explicit financial repression, boosting nominal growth while keeping interest rates near zero at all maturities. The idea is to transfer wealth from savers to borrowers, the government included, to reduce debt burdens and wipe the slate clean. \u201cMonetary policy didn\u2019t ease today, as the muted market reaction shows, but the economy isn\u2019t weak enough to merit it. If growth turns downwards, the new framework allows Japan to make short rates more negative, increase the monetary base and expand government spending without needing to worry about the markets.\u201d The markets are still digesting today\u2019s announcement, which sent the Tokyo stock market up by 2%. The yen, though, has reversed its initial selloff and is now at a four-week high against the US dollar. That\u2019s not what the BoJ wants to see.... Lord Livermore (a former top strategist for Gordon Brown and Tony Blair) cautions against complacency over the EU referendum effect. City experts have now had a few hours to digest the Bank of Japan\u2019s new stimulus plan. And opinion is still split. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group reckons that the BoJ is paving the way for the Japanese government to boost its spending, turning monetary stimulus into fiscal muscle. He explains: The BOJ is effectively pledging to hold ten year borrowing costs at around zero (the yield curve target) and to do this for quite some time (the inflation overshoot pledge). That is a strong signal that the government should follow through with fiscal stimulus \u2014 stimulus that effectively comes with no borrowing costs. It\u2019s not quite a monetary financing but it\u2019s a step closer. A pledge to overshoot a target you\u2019ve consistently failed to hit isn\u2019t especially credible. The macro impact of that pledge through expectations is unlikely to be large. But a pledge to finance government spending at zero per cent for the coming years could be a much bigger deal \u2014 even if it is only making explciit what has been implicit in Japan for quite some time. Here\u2019s the full piece: Nick Gartside of JP Morgan Asset Management says the BoJ have been pretty creative, defying those who thought central banks were out of ammunition. By adopting the \u2018yield curve control concept\u2019, which is designed to steepen the Japanese yield curve by targeting a 10 year JGB yield of 0%, the Bank of Japan showed that central bankers still have a few tricks up their sleeves. \u201cThis is a creative and imaginative policy and markets have reacted favourably. The policy, which also commits to expanding the monetary base until inflation reaches 2% on a sustainable basis, is a form of long range forward guidance. Royal London Asset Management reckon the BoJ will be flooding Japan with money for some time -- which should pump share prices higher. Bur Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears the BoJ may be firing blanks. Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s UK public finances.... Every cloud has a darker cloud behind it.... In a busy morning for Brexity data, the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents have reported that UK firms have cut back on investment intentions, and hiring plans, since the Referendum. But there are signs of a pick-up in August. Here\u2019s the key points: More here: Economist Rupert Seggins has helpfully charted today\u2019s data: Property transaction figures from HMRC out today show that there hasn\u2019t been the market crash that many feared following the Brexit vote in June. Residential property transactions were broadly flat between July and August, albeit down 6.1% from a year ago. The provisional figures show that 97,660 homes were bought in August, only slightly lower than the 97,710 that changed hands in July. (These are seasonally adjusted figures.) Commercial deals picked up again, after a drop in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote to 10,010 in July from 10,630 in June. Non-residential transactions totalled 10,620 in August, up 6.1% from July and 8% higher than a year ago. David Brown, chief executive of London estate agents Marsh &amp; Parsons, said of the residential figures: \u201cThe total numbers for Q1 and Q2 of 2016 were astronomically high compared to the corresponding period last year. Consequently the market is still levelling after the frenzy we saw as people clambered to meet the April Stamp Duty deadline. This, along with the Bank of England\u2019s plans to curb Buy-to-let mortgages, caused such an enormous spike in activity, that even if we had not had the referendum vote, we would have expected to spend a good few months seeing the market recover to some level of normality. \u201cAt Marsh &amp; Parsons we are certainly seeing good levels of activity, and it is particularly pleasing to see a number of enquiries resurfacing from people who had put their property searches on hold a couple of months ago. We are feeling optimistic about the remainder of the year.\u201d The Financial Times also reckons Britain is going to miss its borrowing target this year: The old targets may be academic, though, if Philip Hammond does tear up George Osborne\u2019s fiscal targets in two months time.... This chart shows how the OECD have just halved their forecast for UK growth next year, from 2% to 1%. But Britain is one of the few countries whose 2016 growth has been revised UP (by 0.1% to 1.8%): Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has responded to the OECD\u2019s warning that UK growth be robust this year, but slow in 2017. He says: \u201cThe underlying strength in the UK economy will support growth this year, and we have seen that in the labour market where employment is at a record high. The OECD highlights uncertainty in their outlook, and while I recognise that there may be some difficult times ahead, I am confident that we have the tools necessary to support the economy as we adjust to a new relationship with the EU and take advantage of the opportunities that it offers.\u201d That reference to \u2018tools\u2019 suggests Hammond is planning to use November\u2019s Autumn Statement to reset the government\u2019s fiscal plan - perhaps through additional infrastructure spending funded by more borrowing? Today\u2019s public finance figures show that Britain has borrowed \u00a35bn less this financial year, compared with a year ago. Encouraging...but not enough to hit this year\u2019s deficit targets. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, explains: \u201cIt may still be very difficult for the Chancellor to meet the March Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast for 2016/17, which envisaged public borrowing being \u00a321 billion lower than the latest estimate for 2015/16. We expect that the OBR will revise up its borrowing projections materially in November and the Chancellor is unlikely to seek to offset this at a time when the priority is to support the economy in the uncertain period following the Brexit vote. Speaking of Brexit...The west\u2019s leading economic thinktank has backtracked on its warning that the UK would suffer instant damage if the public voted to leave the European Union. In a new report, the OECD has thrown its weight behind plans by Theresa May to provide fresh post-referendum support to growth in November\u2019s autumn statement. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reports: Until recently a staunch supporter of George Osborne\u2019s austerity plan, the OECD said it was appropriate for the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, to increase public spending in his first major policy statement later this year. The thinktank said it was still predicting a sharp slowdown in the economy, but that this would not happen until 2017. It said that the expected negative effects on the rest of the global economy of Brexit \u2013 compared in June to the equivalent of a hard landing for China \u2013 had also been delayed. The OECD now expects the UK to grow by 1.8% this year, a small increase on its old forecast. But this will fall to 1% in 2017, they fear. The OECD also cut its growth forecasts for the global economy; world GDP is now expected to rise by 3.2% in 2017, down from the 3.3% previously. Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), fears that Britain\u2019s public finances will deteriorate in the months ahead: \u201cAlthough government borrowing fell in August, it was by less than many had expected. \u201cIf the UK economy slows as we expect, cutting the deficit is likely to become increasingly problematic as materially weaker growth will make it more difficult to generate tax revenue. ONS chief economist Joe Grice says today\u2019s data confirms that Britain hasn\u2019t suffered a severe Brexit shock. \u201cAs the available information grows, the referendum result appears, so far, not to have had a major effect on the UK economy. So it hasn\u2019t fallen at the first fence but longer-term effects remain to be seen.\u201d Of course, Britain hasn\u2019t even triggered Article 50 yet -- and no-one knows what kind of Soft Brexit, or Hard Brexit, we will end up with. The 8% improvement in August\u2019s UK public finances isn\u2019t enough to get the British government\u2019s deficit reduction plan back on track. So says Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. He\u2019s encouraged that there\u2019s no sign of a Brexit-induced meltdown, but fears the economy will slow in 2017 as negotiations with the European Union intensify. Here\u2019s his snap take: Mixed news for Chancellor Phillip Hammond as the public finances saw a modestly reduced year-on-year shortfall in August and July\u2019s surplus was revised up slightly. On the positive side, this adds to the evidence that the economy has been resilient so far following June\u2019s Brexit vote, with tax receipts holding up relatively well overall. Nevertheless, the public finances are still off track to meet the March budget target, which highlights the fact that the Chancellor really has limited ability to provide a boost to the economy in November\u2019s Autumn Statement if he is to maintain a semblance of fiscal discipline. Newsflash from London: Britain\u2019s monthly deficit shrank by 8% in August, despite the shock of June\u2019s EU referendum. The Office for National Statistics reports that the UK borrowed \u00a310.546bn to balance the books last month, down from \u00a311.47bn in August 2015 [that excludes the impact of our stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group]. However, that\u2019s more than expected - the City had forecast a monthly deficit of \u00a310.0bn. So the government may still be struggling to hit this year\u2019s borrowing target: Importantly, the ONS says there are no clear signs of any impact on the public finances, following the Brexit vote. They report that income tax receipts were strong in August, but VAT receipts grew at their slowest pace since March 2015. More to follow.... Bloomberg\u2019s Jonathan Ferro smells a rat.... Oh dear... the early yen selloff has faded: Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda has put down the jam knife, and faced the press to explain the new stimulus measures agreed today. He insists that the BoJ could launch more stimulus measures, if needed, including cutting interest rates deeper into negative. Kuroda says: \u201cWe won\u2019t hesitate to adjust monetary policy with an eye on economic and price developments. \u201cWe will ease further when necessary. We can cut short-term rates, lower the long-term rate target, buy more assets or if conditions warrant, accelerate the pace of expansion in monetary base. There\u2019s room to ease further with the three dimensions of quantity and quality of assets as well as interest rates.\u201d Kuroda also conceded that his stimulus package hasn\u2019t yet delivered the goods, since it was launched in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s true that more than three years have passed. But there\u2019s absolutely no change to our commitment to achieve 2 percent (inflation) at the earliest date possible. And he also claimed that the BoJ will be able to manage the \u2018yield curve\u2019 (which tracks the interest rate on shorter and longer-dated bonds) \u201cI won\u2019t say we can fully control long-term rates like the way we control short-term rates. But central banks have already been taking steps to directly influence long-term rates. The BOJ has done so too and clearly has been successful.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, reckons governor Kuroda has scraped together whatever he could find: Some City investors are wondering whether to bet against the central bank... There\u2019s nothing like the smell of more easy money to get bank shares rallying... European stock markets are rallying in early trading, led by the banking sector. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 35 points, or 0.5%, to 6867, as investors give an early thumbs-up to the BoJ\u2019s announcement. Barclays (+4%) is the top riser in London, with Lloyds Banking Group (+2.5%) and Standard Chartered (2.2%).close behind Germany\u2019s DAX index has jumped by 1%, while the French CAC is up by 1.2%. That follows the strong trading in Asia, where Japan\u2019s market jumped by 2%. Traders are welcoming the new that central banks can still find ways to stimulate their economies (even though we don\u2019t know if it will work. Mike van Dulken &amp; Henry Croft at Accendo Markets explain: The positive start comes after a markets welcomed the Bank of Japan (BoJ) leaving its already negative interest rates unchanged overnight and tweaking its existing stimulus programme. This buys governor Kuroda some time and leaves the door open for more rate cuts/policy easing which has seen the Yen weaken to the benefit of Nikkei exporters and helped financials rally. As expected, the BoJ has offered an interesting policy update for markets to digest and is a good effort at dispelling uncertainty about global central bank\u2019s losing potency and running out of ammo. And while the Fed is unlikely to make any policy change tonight, its message and sure-fire subtle hints certainly could, especially in light of fresh Yen weakness sending the US dollar basket to September highs. Today\u2019s measures are being dubbed \u201cQQEYCC\u201d, or \u201cquantitative and qualitative monetary easing with yield curve control\u201d. Yield curve control? Well, that\u2019s the new commitment to keep the yield, or interest rates, on Japanese 10-year bonds at zero. Peter Wells of FastFT has done a nice explanation: If there\u2019s one thing we can be sure of, it\u2019s that the Bank of Japan has added to its alphabet ramen of policy terms. Markets will now be served a piping hot bowl of \u201cquantitative and qualitative monetary easing with yield curve control\u201d. Yield curve control\u2026 isn\u2019t that part of the auto-pilot function in a Tesla? It may well be, but in the context of the Bank of Japan it means policymakers are making a renewed effort to keep borrowing costs low in an effort to spur growth. There\u2019s broad agreement that the Bank of Japan has taken monetary policy into new territory today, despite leaving interest rates on hold. But while some financial experts welcome the changes to the BoJ\u2019s stimulus package, others fear that it won\u2019t work. Takashi Miura, banking analyst at Credit Suisse, says the new measure are a \u201cpositive surprise\u201d. It\u2019s positive for banks. The BOJ did not deepen the negative rate, so there\u2019s no impact on banks\u2019 lending rates. Furthermore, I think the BOJ\u2019s new target to keep 10-year yields hovering around zero percent means the central bank effectively won\u2019t deepen the negative rate. That is a positive for banks. Divya Devesh of Standard Chartered says the key news is the BoJ\u2019s new commitment to overshoot the 2percent inflation target: That\u2019s committing to continue easing for longer than previously expected. Also hinting that the balance sheet will remain large for a long time. We think that\u2019s dollar/yen positive. Also, markets are a bit relieved given no further cuts to interest rates.\u201d However.... Nick Kounis of ABN Amro isn\u2019t convinced that today\u2019s measures go far enough. This is from Ilya Spivak of DailyFX.com Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group argues that Tokyo\u2019s government needs to boost spending too: The Bank of Japan will be pleased to see that the yen is weakening. The Japanese currency has fallen by 1% against the US dollar, from \u00a5101 to \u00a5102. Lower is better, if you\u2019re trying to get inflation higher #CurrencyWars The Tokyo stock market has rallied strongly, as investors welcome the Bank of Japan\u2019s new commitment to overshoot its inflation target. The Nikkei has jumped by almost 2%, or 315 points, while the wider Topix index gained 2.7%. Bank shares are leading the rally; on relief that the BoJ didn\u2019t slash interest rates deeper into negative territory. Good morning. Central bankers have fired a lot of ammunition into the financial system, in the eight years since the crisis blew up. And the Bank of Japan has just shown that they\u2019re not out of firepower yet. The BoJ has rebooted its stimulus programme overnight, announcing a cocktail of new targets and measures. It\u2019s a new bid to drive inflation and growth, and weaken the yen. But it also resisted slashing interest rates; instead, it has adjusted its bond-buying efforts, and reasserted its commitment to getting inflation back to 2%. At its eagerly awaited policy meeting today, the BoJ: Left interest rates at their current record low of minus 0.1%. Promised to keep intervening until inflation \u201cexceeds the price stability target of 2 per cent and stays above the target in a stable manner\u201d. Vowed to maintain its existing its government bond buying \u201cmore or less in line with the current pace\u201d of \u00a580tn a year. But it will buy fewer very long-dated bonds, which should push up long-term interest rates and help banks make profits. Announced a pledge to cap 10-year government bond yields at zero per cent. That means the BoJ must keep intervening in the markets to prevent borrowing costs rising, and to ensure Tokyo can borrow for a decade for free. It all adds up to another commitment to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to drag Japan\u2019s economy out of its ever-lengthening period of weak growth and soggy inflation. The Financial Times are calling it an \u201cunprecedented new kind of monetary easing\u201d. We should hear more from Japanese central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda shortly. And it sets the tone for a big day in central banking. At 7pm BST, the US Federal Reserve will announce whether it has taken the plunge and raised interest rates for the first time this year. The markets are expecting the Fed to leave rates on hold, probably until December. But as the BoJ showed today, you never quite know where you are with central banks....",

If anything, [today\u2019s Bank of Japan] announcement of new easing measures could even further discourage a Fed move, but as it already stands, there are very few market participants that are betting on such a move to higher interest rates, at least for this particular Fed meeting. Key Fed speakers and major US economic data releases have alternately shifted the discussion from one side to another in the past few weeks.

The one potentially brighter spot for the Fed was the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reading for August, which showed that both headline and core prices increased by more than expected. Despite this more buoyant view of inflation, however, it is still unlikely to be enough to sway the Fed into action today.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Amidst all of these economic data releases and Fed member speeches, the market\u2019s view of the implied probability of a rate hike today has continued to hover in the low-to-high teens.

The Federal Reserve will keep its main rate on hold at 0.25-0.50%, citing near-term, weak economic developments, yet insisting that enough progress has been made to warrant a rate hike at one of the upcoming meetings (hint: December, when the next SEPs are released). The key for the US Dollar today, however, is to what degree of confidence the FOMC has in the US economy, or simply, \u2018how quickly does the Fed think it will be able to raise rates next?\u2019</p> <p>...In actuality, rate expectations are completely muted for today and are sitting on the fence for 2016.</p> <p>This is the main source of risk for markets today. Should the FOMC choose to be headstrong and tear down conventional wisdom - a small possibility with two prime dealers coming out and calling for a rate hike - global markets will be shocked. But assuming the Fed plays it safe as it usually does, a lack of a rate hike may not hurt the US Dollar significantly. By suggesting that a rate hike is still \u201con the table\u201d in the near-term, and by laying out an interest rate glide path for next year calling for multiple rate hikes, then the Fed could help insulate the US dollar, plain and simple.

      "bodyText": "When Barclays in 2012 became the first big bank to be fined for trying to rig the Libor interbank rate, its chief executive lost his job within days. He was bundled out of the door with a shove from the governor of the Bank of England. Other banks\u2019 Libor sins subsequently turned out to be equally grave, but few would argue that Bob Diamond was treated harshly, even if it was traders who were to blame. The buck had to stop at the top. Barclays\u2019 clean-up operation would not have been credible otherwise. Now consider the tricks played by Wells Fargo, the US bank where John Stumpf somehow survives as chairman and chief executive. Wells Fargo, which used to be America\u2019s most admired lender, created 2m accounts and credit cards for customers who had requested no such thing. The customers only noticed when the fees started to appear. And the deep cause of the scandal was a sales culture that imposed impossible-to-meet targets on branch staff who feared for their jobs. Wells Fargo has been fined $185m by regulators but Stumpf is still in office, singing the standard refrain that he didn\u2019t know what was happening in the bank he was paid $19.5m (\u00a315m) last year to manage. Senator Elizabeth Warren gave her assessment in an admirable eight-minute onslaught on Tuesday. A stupefied Stumpf was told his leadership was \u201cgutless\u201d, that he should return pay, that he was pushing blame on to junior employees (5,300 were sacked) and that he should be criminally investigated. The encounter is worth viewing. The boss of a big UK bank would not survive in similar circumstances. Our regulators may sometimes be tame, but a swift Diamond-style exit would surely be arranged if the non-executives proved spineless. What are the American authorities playing at? Trust in banks has barely improved since the bust and it\u2019s hard to imagine a case more likely to enrage customers. Don\u2019t they know there\u2019s an election on? Chancellor Philip Hammond should flash the cash The medium and long-term economic consequences of Brexit remain cloudy but the short-term picture is becoming clearer. The UK has not fallen into a funk. This paper\u2019s analysis of the post-referendum economic data shows as much, and now even the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is sounding more measured. The OECD has pencilled in growth of 1.8% in the UK this year, a 0.1 percentage point improvement from its last guess. The OECD is still predicting a slowdown to 1% in 2017, it should be said, which makes sense. Large economies do not turn on a sixpence but lower business investment, flowing from nervousness about access to the single market, is inevitable. Yet the OECD\u2019s policy prescriptions are always more interesting than its growth forecasts. On that score, the thinktank advises chancellor Philip Hammond to pull out his chequebook. The UK, like many countries, has room to pursue \u201ca growth-friendly mix by increasing hard and soft infrastructure spending\u201d. That is a welcome change of heart from the OECD, previously an austerity purist. Conditions for higher spending are excellent in the UK, even if the level of public debt is not. The government can borrow at next to nothing for 30 years and inflation is low. Even if the fall in sterling causes inflation to reach 3% in 2018, that wouldn\u2019t be a catastrophe. It is a good moment to address the historic underspending on infrastructure (as long as it\u2019s not HS2). Hammond should draw a simple conclusion: if he is timid, he is inviting growth to fall to 1%, or worse, next year; if he is brave, he has a reasonable chance of doing better. The ugly face of Big Pharma in the US At almost $10,000 per small tube, Aloquin acne cream must be a new wonder-cure. It\u2019s not, of course: it\u2019s just another example, uncovered by the FT, of gouging in the US pharmaceuticals market. A Chicago-based outfit called Novum Pharma bought the old treatment last year and started imposing massive price hikes. It can hope to gain from such ugly tactics because the bizarre US healthcare system has no effective body to police prices. Hillary Clinton wants to legislate if she gets in, and you might expect Big Pharma to be supportive, if only to try to avoid being caught in the backlash. But, no, Ian Read, the chief executive of Pfizer, called Clinton\u2019s proposals \u201cvery negative\u201d because they would cause drug \u201crationing\u201d. What? If his opening position is to defend the indefensible, the pharma industry\u2019s business model in the US must be more fragile than assumed.",

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve announced it would hold US interest rates unchanged for at least another month on Wednesday. But the US central bank signalled that the case for an increase later this year had strengthened. \u201cOur decision does not reflect lack of confidence in the economy,\u201d Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, said. But the Fed\u2019s board was split and the decision came as three members of the 12-strong panel voted to raise rates this month. \u201cThe economy has a bit more running room than might have been previously thought,\u201d Yellen said. At the same time, she added she did not \u201cwant the economy to overheat\u201d and the case for a rate increase \u201chas strengthened.\u201d Yellen pointed out that over the past four months, about 180,000 jobs have been created each month in the US. While job creation continues at a \u201csolid pace\u201d and unemployment remains at 4.9%, where it was in January, 6.1 million people were working part-time but would like to have full-time jobs, a figure higher than the Fed would like, said Yellen. By keeping the rates unchanged, the Fed expected the labor market to continue to improve. The decision leaves the Fed\u2019s interest rate range at 0.25%-0.50%, where it has been stuck since the Fed raised interest rates last December, the first hike in almost a decade. Fourteen of the Fed\u2019s 17 policymakers expect at least one hike by the end of this year. The Fed meets twice more this year \u2013 once in November, a week before the US presidential election, and then again in December. Most economists now expect just one rate hike this year, if that. According to economists polled by Reuters, there is a 70% likelihood of a rate hike in December. \u201cWe are also expecting that officials will not want to tighten at the 1-2 November meeting given its close proximity to election day,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cThey would risk making Fed policy a major issue, or being viewed as a major influence on the outcome, particularly if the contest is close.\u201d Asked whether politics would impact a rate decision at the November meeting Yellen said: \u201cPartisan politics plays no role in our decisions,\u201d said Yellen. \u201cWe do not discuss politics at our meetings and we do not take politics into account in our decisions.\u201d The Fed\u2019s decision came on the same day that Japan\u2019s central bank resorted to a new measure of monetary policy as it attempts to escape decades of deflation and stimulate activity in the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. The Bank of Japan said it would target interest rates on government bonds as the latest measure to achieve its elusive inflation target. Japan has deployed increasingly radical measures, including negative interest rates, as it attempts to stimulate investment and spending. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the bank would deliberately seek to overshoot its 2% inflation target.",

While job creation continues at a \u201csolid pace\u201d and unemployment remains at 4.9%, where it was in January, 6.1 million people were working part-time but would like to have full-time jobs, a figure higher than the Fed would like, said Yellen.

      "bodyText": "Apple has been linked with a shock \u00a31.5bn deal to buy McLaren Technology Group, the Formula One team owner and supercar maker. A deal between Apple and the British company would dramatically shake up the technology and automotive industries. The California-based company\u2019s interest in McLaren Technology Group highlights its ambition to develop technology that could be used in an electric and driverless car. Apple has approached McLaren about a takeover but could also make a strategic investment in the company, the Financial Times reported. McLaren denied that it was in talks with Apple, but it said: \u201cAs you would expect, the nature of our business means we regularly have confidential conversations with a wide range of parties, and they need to remain so. \u201cWe can confirm that McLaren is not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.\u201d Apple said it \u201cdoes not comment on rumours or speculation\u201d. McLaren builds supercars such as the P1, which costs \u00a3866,000 and includes ground-breaking technology such as a lightweight electric motor, carbon fibre body panel, and on-board computer systems. The company is also developing a range of technologies for use in healthcare, energy and transport. Ron Dennis, the chair and chief executive, has expanded the company dramatically from its origins in Formula One, where it is one of the most successful teams in the history of the sport despite struggling in recent seasons. The company is based in Woking, Surrey, in a futuristic headquarters designed by Norman Foster. Dennis would be in line for a multimillion-pound windfall if a deal with Apple goes through. He owns 25% of McLaren Technology Group while Tag Group, a Luxembourg-based holding company led by Mansour Ojjeh, owns another 25% and Bahrain\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Bahrain Mumtalakat holds the other half of the business. McLaren Technology Group\u2019s last financial results show the company recorded sales of \u00a3266m in 2014 and a pre-tax loss of \u00a323m. It produces roughly 1,500 cars a year but has pledged to spend \u00a31bn on research and development over the next six years. Analysts said a move for McLaren would make sense for Apple. Neil Campling, analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said it would provide Apple with \u201cinstant credibility\u201d in the automotive industry and that the companies had \u201can unusual level of compatibility in design and business outlook\u201d. He added: \u201cThe attractiveness of McLaren \u2013 the designer of very high-end automotive products on and off the race track \u2013 to Apple, with its own reputation for design-centricity and technological expertise, is quite obvious. McLaren\u2019s tagline could almost be Apple\u2019s \u2013 \u2018Designed and Engineered to Win\u2019. \u201cApple has the balance sheet to do it \u2013 they could do the deal for only a fortnight\u2019s free cash flow \u2013 and there are logical commonalities in business model. Perhaps the real jewel in McLaren\u2019s crown from Apple\u2019s perspective is its applied technologies business, the [research and development] lab born from their Formula One expertise. \u201cIf, as has been rumoured for some time, Apple is serious about the autonomous vehicle market, buying McLaren gives them instant credibility in the sector and brings with it an unusual level of compatibility in design and business outlook. It won\u2019t shift the Apple dial much on its own so we read it as a statement of intent regarding autonomous vehicles.\u201d Apple rarely makes acquisitions, and a takeover of McLaren would be its biggest deal since it bought the Beats headphone brand for $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) in 2014. The US company is understood to have been developing a driverless car in a secretive project codenamed Project Titan. However, a number of workers have left the initiative in recent months, leading to speculation that Apple is struggling with its design or director. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, has never publicly acknowledged the project. Kelley Blue Book, the US automotive research group, said McLaren\u2019s cars were popular in Silicon Valley. Phil Schiller, senior vice president for worldwide marketing at Apple, owns a McLaren. Michael Harley, analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said: \u201cApple\u2019s potential acquisition of McLaren isn\u2019t nearly as far-fetched as its initially sounds. Apple has been rumoured, but never officially confirmed, to be working on an electric car. McLaren is well-known as a manufacturer of high-performance sports and racing cars, but its true expertise is in engineering lightweight materials such as carbon fibre and aluminum, both of which are key building blocks to designing an innovative lightweight vehicle. \u201cCombine McLaren\u2019s many proprietary patents with its proficiency in race technology, hi-tech medical devices, and research, and the two do appear to be a perfect match for each other.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Network Rail has been fined \u00a34m for a string of safety failures after a woman was struck and killed by a train on a foot crossing. Olive McFarland, 82, was hit in August 2011 by a train travelling at nearly 100mph on a section of track that an employee of Network Rail said should have been restricted to 55mph. However, the safety work had not been done ahead of the incident on the crossing near Needham Market, Suffolk. The company, fined at Ipswich crown court on Wednesday, admitted being an employer in breach of a general duty of care for a period spanning from January 1999 to the day of McFarland\u2019s death. As well as being handed the \u00a34m fine, which it has 28 days to pay, Network Rail was ordered to pay costs of \u00a335,857. McFarland, born Brenda McFarland, was a former actor who was a regular in television dramas and films between the 1950s and the 1970s. She appeared alongside Sean Connery in 1961 film The Frightened City and in TV series The Sweeney. She had a home at Creeting St Mary near Stowmarket, Suffolk, and lived in a care home in Eye. A statement was read out in court by McFarland\u2019s nephew, John Black, on behalf of her sister, Dory Black, which described her death as a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d. The fine follows an investigation by the railways regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, which found Network Rail had failed to act on substantial evidence that pedestrians had poor visibility of trains when approaching the Gipsy Lane foot crossing at Needham Market, and were exposed to an increased risk of being struck by a train. Ian Prosser, the chief inspector of railways, said: \u201cIn 2011, Network Rail\u2019s safety management fell below the standards required, putting members of the public using Gipsy Lane footpath crossing in unnecessary danger. \u201cOver the past decade, Network Rail has focused its attention and investment on improving health and safety on Britain\u2019s railways. \u201cHowever, despite now being ranked as the safest in Europe, there can be no room for complacency. Rail safety remains a top priority for the regulator.\u201d In a statement issued after the hearing, Richard Schofield, route managing director at Network Rail, said the company had improved safety since the incident by introducing a speed restriction on the line, and reducing the crossing distance by straightening it and repositioning the gates. However, he added that the company believed removing the level crossing was the safest option and said it was working with the local community to get their support for the closure. \u201cIn the year following Miss McFarland\u2019s death, the executive directors turned down their bonus entitlement and instead chose for this money to be reallocated to a safety improvement fund for level crossings,\u201d Schofield said. Network Rail said it had closed more than 1,000 crossings since 2010 and was spending \u00a3100m across the country to improve level-crossing safety.",

    "webTitle": "US drug company hiked price of acne cream by 3,900% in less than 18 months", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A US drug company has increased the price of an acne cream by more than 3,900% to $9,561 in less than 18 months in the latest example of drug \u201cprice gouging\u201d, which has enraged the American public and become a central topic of debate in the presidential election campaign. Novum Pharma, a recently formed privately held Chicago-based company, bought the rights to drug Aloquin in May 2015. The 60g cream, which contains two cheap ingredients, was sold by its previous owner, Primus Pharmaceuticals, for $241.50. Novum almost immediately increased the price by 1,100%, and hiked the price higher still in January 2016. Figures seen by the Financial Times show the company increased the price a third time last week to take the cost to $9,561. The revelation of the latest huge drug price hike on Wednesday comes as the US Congress prepares to grill the chief executive of Mylan, the company that increased the price of the allergic reaction treatment EpiPen by more than 500%. So-called \u201cprice gouging\u201d, in which companies buy the rights to older drugs and then vastly increase their cost, has provoked outrage across the country and led to calls for reform of the US healthcare system. Martin Shkreli, a hedge fund manager-turned-pharmaceutical boss, was dubbed \u201cthe world\u2019s most hated man\u201d after he increased the price of a drug used to treat patients with HIV by 5,000%. Earlier this month, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, vowed that if elected she would fine companies for price gouging. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move beyond talking about these price hikes and start acting to address them,\u201d she said. \u201cAll Americans deserve full access to the medications they need \u2013 without being burdened by excessive, unjustified costs.\u201d Research by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the prices of more than 400 generic drugs were increased by more than 1,000% between 2008 and 2015. Clinton said she would change the law to allow the \u201cemergency importation\u201d of safe alternative treatments from abroad. Aloquin contains two cheap active ingredients: a decades-old antibiotic, iodoquinol, and an extract from the aloe vera plant. Iodoquinol can be bought for as little as $30 a tube and aloe vera cream costs a few dollars. The drug is labelled as \u201cpossibly effective\u201d, as the US Food and Drug Administration has stated that there is only limited evidence that the drug is effective. Novum has also drastically increased the price of its other two skin creams, Alcortin A and Novacort. The drugs are prescription only, with the cost being mostly covered by health insurance or government assistance. In instances when the full cost of the treatment isn\u2019t covered by insurance, Novum provides coupons to reduce the proportion that patients have to pay, while collecting the rest from the health plan. The company, which is privately held and does not publish figures on sales or profits, did not reply to requests for comment. A spokesman told the FT that the firm was founded by \u201ca group of like-minded investors who believe in the firm\u2019s focus of providing therapeutic innovations that are affordable for patients\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thousands of workers could lose their job at Marks &amp; Spencer if they do not agree to changes to their pay and pensions, according to an MP. Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden, said a leaked document from M&amp;S showed the clothing and food retailer was prepared to cut in-store jobs if employees did not accept new terms. The internal document, headlined \u201cpay and pension changes\u201d, refers to a \u201ccollective consultation for dissenters if required\u201d. A timetable shows the consultation beginning on 14 November and the notice period for staff starting on 19 December, just days before Christmas. However, the retailer insisted that it did not want any employees to leave and the consultation was just one option being considered. Under this plan, staff who have rejected the new conditions would have their existing contracts terminated and then be offered a new contract with the new terms. A spokesperson for M&amp;S said: \u201cThe company has no intention that anyone would leave as a result of these changes. The changes, which will take effect from April, will reward our people in a fair and consistent way, simplify and modernise our business and make our colleagues amongst the highest paid in UK retail. Nobody need be worse off and the vast majority will receive higher total pay.\u201d Long-serving shop staff fear they could face pay cuts that could potentially cost thousands of pounds after M&amp;S removed premiums for working Sundays and antisocial hours, trimmed bank holiday payments and changed pension payments. McDonagh said 2,700 staff would lose more than \u00a31,000 a year and 700 would lose more than \u00a32,000. The retailer claims 90% of its 69,000 staff will be better off from the pay changes. Approximately 11,000 workers will be affected by the pension overhaul, under which those in the defined benefit scheme will no longer earn new benefits. The retailer said it was making the changes to help pay for a 15% increase in basic pay for its 69,000 workers from April to \u00a38.50 an hour. In response to criticism of the move, M&amp;S has improved its offer to staff so everyone will either receive higher pay or have the opportunity to maintain their current pay level through top up payments and working more hours. M&amp;S has pledged to top-up the pay of those affected to 2015-16 levels for two years. Any employee whose pay in 2019-20 is still lower under the new regime will receive an additional top-up payment representing 50% of that shortfall in total pay and be offered guaranteed extra hours to make up the remaining 50%. However, McDonagh has criticised this offer, claiming that utility bills, rent and travel costs are likely to be higher by 2019 and 2020. Separately, M&amp;S is cutting 525 jobs from its head office in London and is moving another 400 roles outside the capital. The company has about 3,000 head office staff working across seven locations so the changes will affect about a third of them. Steve Rowe, who replaced Marc Bolland as M&amp;S boss earlier this year, said that the retailer need to become a \u201csimpler and more effective organisation if we are to deliver our plans to recover and grow our business\u201d. The head office cuts will save M&amp;S about 1% of its UK costs, after a one-off charge of \u00a315m including payoffs for senior managers.",

    "webTitle": "Ex-EU commissioner Neelie Kroes failed to declare directorship of offshore firm", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former European commissioner Neelie Kroes, who is now a paid adviser to Bank of America and Uber, failed to declare her directorship of an offshore firm in the Bahamas while she was the most powerful corporate enforcer in Brussels. A cache of previously unseen documents published on Wednesday reveal that Kroes was recruited by a venture funded by the United Arab Emirates, which intended to snap up the international assets of the energy company Enron in a $7bn (\u00a35.4bn) deal. The information comes from a leak of 1.3m files from the Bahamas corporate registry, which has brought to light the names of directors and shareholders at nearly 176,000 shell companies, trusts and foundations located in the Caribbean tax haven. The data was received by S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the German newspaper behind the Panama Papers, and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington is releasing it to the public online. Kroes was an EU commissioner from 2004 until 2014, initially overseeing the powerful competition directorate and then Europe\u2019s digital agenda. She was forbidden by the commissioners\u2019 code of conduct to hold any outside directorships while in the roles. The code states: \u201cCommissioners may not engage in any other professional activity, whether gainful or not.\u201d Kroes was also obliged to make a full declaration of her previous financial and corporate interests, stretching back 10 years. She may have breached both of those rules. Papers from the Bahamas corporate registry show that between July 2000 and October 2009, she was registered as a director of Mint Holdings Limited, a company set up by a polo-playing private equity boss from the Middle East. When she joined the European commission in 2004, Kroes declared previous roles at more than 60 companies, foundations and educational bodies, including Volvo, McDonald\u2019s, the defence and aerospace company Thales and the British mobile phone group mmO2. None of her filings, however, mention Mint Holdings. After being approached by the Guardian, the Dutch newspapers Trouw and Het Financieele Dagblad and other media, Kroes responded through her lawyer, who said: \u201cMy client agrees that formally she should have declared this directorship \u2026 Mrs Kroes will inform the president of the European commission of this oversight and will take full responsibility for it.\u201d Kroes\u2019s lawyer said she made her filings in good faith because she believed Mint Holdings had been liquidated in 2002, before her appointment as Europe\u2019s antitrust watchdog. She said she was not paid for her role, did not offer advice on the Enron deal and did not hold shares in the company. She said the company never became operational and there had been no board meetings. Mint Holdings is owned by Amin Badr-El-Din, a former special adviser to the president of the UAE. A polo fanatic who used to breed ponies at an estate in the Chiltern hills, his team has been a regular fixture at Cowdray Park and other prestigious grounds. In 2000, Badr-El-Din led a group of investors in negotiations to buy almost all of Enron\u2019s international assets. He then recruited Kroes, who is also a former Dutch transport minister, to advise on the venture. The talks took place shortly before Enron collapsed, brought down by a major accounting fraud. The UAE deal fell through in the late summer of 2000, because of financial complexities and concerns about Enron\u2019s accounting, Badr-El-Din said. Had it succeeded, the transaction would have placed between $6bn and $8bn worth of assets in India, Turkey, Brazil, the Caribbean and Japan into a company of which Kroes was a board member. The assets included power plants and utility groups, oil and gas reserves, ships and terminal rights and an international gas pipeline. One of the aims was to make Europe less dependent on Russian gas. Mint Holdings was set up to \u201copen the dialogue with Enron\u201d, Badr-El-Din\u2019s lawyer said. The directors were to oversee the hiring of professional advisers, raise funds and agree the final details. The financier briefed Kroes on the strategy, which she found \u201cintriguing enough to join a few friends in Mint\u201d. He said: \u201cIf the deal had been successful then her continued involvement would have been immensely valuable for her strategic vision. Many of the board would have come from the various assets of Enron, the Middle East and internationally. The idea was to build the world\u2019s premier gas-based company.\u201d The financier said he had ordered Mint Holdings to be wound up in 2002, but a \u201cclerical error\u201d meant this never happened. In 2004, it became active, holding shares in another Bahamas company unrelated to Enron or Kroes. It was not until 2009, he says, that Kroes and two other individuals recruited for the Enron deal were discovered to be still on the register of directors. Their names were then removed. Kroes said she was not aware of the mistake until being approached by reporters last week. The UAE attempt to buy Enron\u2019s assets has been reported, but Kroes\u2019s involvement has not been public knowledge until now. The online version of the Bahamas registry, which often contains patchy information on companies, does not list the directors of Mint Holdings. The revelation is likely to cause controversy. During her term, Kroes initiated major interventions in the oil and gas markets. Nicknamed \u201cSteely Neelie\u201d during her time in Brussels for tackling Microsoft and other corporate giants, she conducted a two-year inquiry aimed at challenging the power of former national monopoly companies in the oil and gas sectors. In 2006 she ordered dawn raids on six gas companies, which resulted in E.ON and GDF Suez paying more than \u20ac500m (\u00a3430m) each for breaching cartel rules. Carl Dolan, the EU director of the campaign group Transparency International, said the case reinforced the need for public registers to be more transparent about the owners of offshore companies. He said: \u201cKroes\u2019 links to the proposed Enron deal would have remained a secret were it not for this leak. All EU commissioners, and in particular competition commissioners, have access to privileged and market-sensitive information. \u201cThat\u2019s why asking for a complete record of a commissioner\u2019s past business links is one of most basic things the commission can do to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The fact that Neelie Kroes did not take this obligation sufficiently seriously shows the need for the commission to scrutinise these self-declarations more thoroughly.\u201d The revelations will fuel tensions over the business ties of European commission bosses. The commission\u2019s former president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso is under fire for taking up a post this summer with the investment bank Goldman Sachs as chairman of its international business. Barroso has countered that he is not a lobbyist for the US bank, but one French minister has described the move as \u201cscandalous\u201d and it has prompted an inquiry by the EU ombudsman. The current European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has asked its ethics panel to investigate, and 145,000 people have signed a petition calling for Barroso to have his pension withdrawn. The only sanction available against former commissioners is the loss of their pension and other benefits such as allowances for moving home, and to exercise this the commission must first secure an order from the European court of justice. In order to secure her post as the EU\u2019s antitrust chief, following concerns about her business ties to an array of multinationals, Kroes vowed \u201cnot to engage into any business activity following the end of my term\u201d. Within two years of leaving the commission, however, she has joined three US companies. She is a special adviser to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a full board director at the customer data firm Salesforce, and a policy adviser to the taxi hailing company Uber, which shelters its international revenues from tax through the Netherlands. Kroes is already busy promoting US interests. Earlier this month, she made headlines by criticising the European commission\u2019s ruling that Apple owed the Irish government an estimated \u20ac13bn in unpaid back taxes. Challenged on why Kroes, now 75, had gone back on her promise to stay out of the private sector, her lawyer said: \u201cIt is true that Mrs Kroes made this pledge at the beginning of her first term with the European commission. Having fulfilled this term, Mrs Kroes fulfilled this pledge and did not enter into business activity. Instead, she was honoured with a second term in a completely different field. Having now finished her second term, she no longer feels bound by the commitment made prior to taking her first post.\u201d Additional reporting by Gaby De Groot, Frederik Obermaier, Bastian Obermayer and Will Ftitzgibbon",

      "bodyText": "It was the death threats that set Monticello apart. In the late 1990s, share ramping was an ongoing problem. Unsubstantiated rumours about certain companies would appear in internet chatrooms and share prices would rise and fall dramatically. Monticello plc, which launched at the height of the dotcom boom, was an extreme example. In January 2000, the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark O\u2019Hanlon, gave an extensive and highly misleading interview to a now defunct news site about Monticello\u2019s prospects. Its share price immediately soared. The shares were suspended from Ofex \u2013 the unregulated share market \u2013 then relisted, then barred altogether. As a consequence, dozens of shareholders lost their entire investment in the company. A court was told that \u201cmany investors had lost a very considerable sum of money\u201d. After an inquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), O\u2019Hanlon pleaded guilty to a single count under section 47 of the Financial Services Act 1986 of making a misleading, false or deceptive statement or forecast. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail. One of the key witnesses has told the Guardian he was repeatedly threatened in the run-up to his appearance in court. He says he was told his house would burn down. In an entirely separate investment scam, Monticello\u2019s company secretary Andrew Sommerville was banned from being a director for 12 years. Though the rise and fall of Monticello has been consigned to history, not everyone got dragged down with it. The Guardian can now reveal that one of the main players at Monticello was Amber Rudd. Now the UK home secretary, Rudd was the company\u2019s investment relations officer, which meant she was responsible for maintaining relationships with shareholders as Monticello\u2019s share price moved erratically as a result of the illegal price ramping. However, Monticello was only one of a series of unlikely steps in the home secretary\u2019s career. On the Home Office\u2019s website, in a summary of Rudd\u2019s previous career, she is listed as working in investment banking \u2013 a stint at JP Morgan \u2013 before moving into venture capital. \u201cShe then set up a freelance recruitment business and wrote for financial publications, before being elected to parliament,\u201d it concludes. However, the reality is rather more complicated than that. Born in 1963, Rudd was educated at Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 College, Queen\u2019s College in London and then Edinburgh University. But she soon moved into the world of venture capitalism. Rudd was in her early 20s when her stockbroker father, Tony Rudd, was first investigated by the DTI. It was 1986, and the DTI petitioned for the winding up of Buckingham Corporate Securities, a company based at offices occupied by Tony Rudd and an investment company, Lawnstone. The DTI also investigated another company, Norton Group, which was also connected to the Rudd family. A third investigation by the DTI into a different investment trust labelled Tony Rudd and his business partner as \u201ctotally unfit to be directors of a company\u201d. In the late 1980s, Amber Rudd and later her mother, Ethne, became directors of the Lawnstone investment company, which continued to make payments to her father for consultancy services. The 1988 accounts for Lawnstone also show the company issuing a loan note of \u00a3100,000 to Amber Rudd. It is unclear what happened to the loan. Despite her father\u2019s troubles with investigators, the future MP was not put off. By the time she was 31, she was the executive director of a company called Kensington Resources, which was prospecting for diamonds in Canada. By 1994, a second company called Siberian Pacific Resources \u2013 funded by Zvi Alexander, who was then a key player in the Israeli oil industry \u2013 had managed to obtain Russia\u2019s first issued licence to mine for diamonds. Rudd had raised 500,000 Canadian dollars to hunt for diamonds in the Krasnoyarsk region. By the end of the year, Siberian Pacific Resources was approved for listing on a Canadian stock exchange. The company was not a success. Alexander has written that it was \u201can interesting project with great potential\u201d. But he concludes: \u201cThe economic collapse in Russia in 1996 put an end to this effort as well.\u201d By February 1996, a new company was incorporated, with Rudd as a director and a shareholder. This company was Zinc Metallurgical Products. The plan was to develop a revolutionary way of extracting zinc from ore in Peru. Rudd\u2019s mother and Lawnstone Securities also invested in the new technology. Other shareholders included the Earl of Woolton and Lord Marland, a former Conservative treasurer. In October 1997, the company \u2013 now called The Zinc Corporation \u2013 tried to float on Ofex. It needed to accumulate \u00a3500,000 of investment in order to list on the market, but in a bizarre episode, it lost a key \u00a312,500 cheque from one investor. It was therefore unable to launch, and this meant that all the other cheques had to be returned. At the time, Rudd said: \u201cAfter much soul-searching and a lot of legal advice, we decided to take the ultra-conservative route and return all the money.\u201d Unfortunately, the zinc extraction did not come to fruition either. The annual report for the year ending 1999 shows that the company had made a loss of \u00a3498,043. In January 1999, Monticello made an offer for the company, which is how Rudd came to be involved with O\u2019Hanlon. Set up at the peak of the dotcom boom, the plan was that Monticello would identify startup internet businesses. It would offer them accommodation and business services in return for a share of the equity in those companies, typically 15%. The calculation was that many of the businesses would fail, but from time to time there would be a success story. Rudd became a director of Monticello \u2013 named after the Georgian house in Russell Square in London where the company was based \u2013 in May 1999. It began to develop its business strategy. However, after O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s disastrous interview in early January, the company began to flounder. In May 2000, Rudd stepped down from Monticello, and the company was struck off soon after. The complex case took several years to come to court, and one of the key witnesses said that he received a series of death threats over the telephone from male voices over that period. A spokesperson for the home secretary said: \u201cIt is a matter of public record that Amber had a career in business before entering politics. Monticello was thoroughly investigated 16 years ago and those who acted wrongly were identified and prosecuted.\u201d At the same time as she was a director at Monticello, Rudd was also involved in a Bahamas company called Advanced Asset Allocation Fund, becoming a director in December 1998. She was also a director of another Bahamas company, Advanced Asset Allocation Management, which is revealed for the first time in the Bahamas leaks. She left this company two days after she stepped down from Monticello. During this time, Rudd was also involved in several other business plans, including raising money for a suit designer and a headhunting company. She was also the \u201caristocracy coordinator\u201d for the film Four Weddings and a Funeral, which led to an unlikely business of hiring out \u201cposh\u201d friends to raise the social tone at events. Rudd told Harpers &amp; Queen that her contacts \u201cmight well be more than happy to attend genuine weddings\u201d for \u00a3100 a day. The advantage was that they owned \u201ctheir own morning dress\u201d. In 1990, Rudd married AA Gill, the Sunday Times columnist. They split up in 1995, when he began a relationship with the model Nicola Formby. Amber Rudd\u2019s brother, Roland Rudd, is one of the leading PR executives in London, who runs Finsbury. Eventually, Rudd decided to put her business career behind her. In 2005, she stood for the Tories in the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Garston, and in 2010 she was elected as Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye. She was appointed home secretary in July.",

      "bodyText": "In the digital age, offshore secrets are hard to keep. In its latest revelations, the Guardian is publishing investigations based on the leak of 1.3m internal files from the company register of the Bahamas, one of the world\u2019s most notorious tax havens. The data has brought to light details of the financial interests of politicians, entrepreneurs, financiers \u2013 and fraudsters. Five months after the release of the Panama Papers, this new cache of information from the world of offshore tax havens contains the names of directors and some shareholders at nearly 176,000 shell companies, trusts and foundations. It was received by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, and will be shared with the public in a Bahamas leaks database, built by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington and also launched on Wednesday. Among the revelations are the offshore business dealings of the home secretary, Amber Rudd, along with her involvement in a fund where a fellow director was jailed for making misleading statements to investors. The former EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes has been forced to admit she breached the European commission\u2019s code of conduct by failing to declare her directorship of an offshore company while she was actively policing multinationals. The data also contains trails left by Cem Kinay (German), a property developer wanted by Interpol for bribery, and accused of making a possibly corrupt payment to Michael Misick, the former premier of the Turks and Caicos islands, a British overseas territory. As previous reports have revealed, and the latest leak confirms, David Cameron\u2019s father used the Bahamas as a base from which his Blairmore investment fund avoided tax for three decades. It was also the offshore address of a Mongolian goldmining company whose directors included Sukhbaatar Batbold, an entrepreneur who would go on to become Mongolia\u2019s prime minister. There are many legal reasons for choosing a Bahamas letterbox, chief among them the absence of taxes on company profits, capital gains, income and inheritance. Another reason is anonymity. The Bahamas claims to be a transparent jurisdiction with a public register of companies, but the information shared from the seat of government in Nassau is limited. The corporate registry is supposed to contain the names and addresses of all directors and officers and can in theory be consulted online, but there is no requirement to register the owners of a company with the authorities. Unlike the Cayman Islands and Jersey, the Bahamas has not responded to public pressure to introduce government-held registers of beneficial owners. The Bahamas registry website is often unavailable and the information it contains is patchy. Neelie Kroes, for example, does not appear in the online entry for the company of which she was a director. Complete information can often only be obtained by phone and fax or a visit in person. Importantly, it is not possible to search for names of individual directors, but only by company name, which can make wrongdoing hard to track. The Bahamas has bilateral information-sharing agreements with 32 countries, including the UK, Germany, France and the US, but has completed no new deals since 2013. Many of these agreements are of limited use because they are with other tax havens, such as Guernsey and Malta, or with tiny economies such as Greenland. Even with a bilateral agreement, investigators cannot ask the Bahamas for all of the information it may have on an individual. They must first have the name of their bank or offshore company. \u201cWe believe this kind of basic information, the names of people who are linked to what companies, is something that should be openly available \u2013 just as the former prime minister David Cameron himself once indicated,\u201d the ICIJ\u2019s director, Gerard Ryle, said. \u201cWe are publishing this information as a public service.\u201d With $223bn (\u00a3172bn) stashed in the small Caribbean nation\u2019s banks, 26 times its GDP, the former British colony is increasingly seen as clinging to the secrecy that has allowed it to attract such money. Representatives from the Bahamas have been touring the conference circuit. Offshore service providers will gather in Panama City next week for a conference about marketing their services to Latin American clients. Among the banks and law firms sponsoring the event, one of the logos on the promotional website stands out: the official seal of the of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. \u201cWhat do you think they are there for, to push the beaches?\u201d asked Mark Morris, an adviser to the European parliament and the Tax Justice Network. \u201cThey are going round the world saying \u2018bring your untaxed money to us\u2019. People send money to Nassau by the billions because they know it\u2019s safe. Even compared to Switzerland, the Bahamas is now the number one tax haven.\u201d Responding to queries about its record of cooperation in fighting tax evasion and money laundering, the Bahamas financial services ministry said it was committed to transparency. \u201cThe Bahamas does not tolerate \u2018dirty money\u2019,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Bahamas has a long history of honouring its international obligations including cooperating with international authorities with respect to legally conducted investigations and/or asset recovery initiatives when received through the proper channels.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Amber Rudd\u2019s business career has come under scrutiny following a Guardian investigation that reveals her involvement with two companies in an offshore tax haven, and another where her co-director was jailed for fraud. A fresh leak of tax haven data names the home secretary as having been a director of two companies in the Bahamas \u2013 a fact she did not refer to earlier this year when defending David Cameron over his father\u2019s investment fund in the same country. The Guardian has also discovered new details about her previous career in venture capital during the boom and bust 1990s. One enterprise led her to become a co-director of Monticello, a company that was at the centre of a share ramping investigation. She was also involved in a company prospecting for diamonds in Siberia that was traded on a notoriously unregulated stock exchange. Rudd said that her career in business prior to politics was public knowledge but declined to answer questions, including whether she had invested in the Bahamas companies or whether either company had paid tax in the UK. A rising star of the Conservative party, Rudd has provided scant details about her career before she became an MP in 2010. Though there is no suggestion she was involved in any wrongdoing, the disclosures may cause her some embarrassment, particularly as pressure grows to crack down on tax avoidance and governments demand more transparency from offshore regimes. The home secretary\u2019s name appears in a cache of company data from the Bahamas, a Caribbean tax haven that imposes no income, corporate or wealth taxes on individuals investing in offshore companies. The data, leaked to the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, constitutes a list of directors of 175,000 Bahamas registered companies. The files name Rudd as having been a director of two Bahamas companies, Advanced Asset Allocation Fund and Advanced Asset Allocation Management, between 1998 and 2000. Records at Companies House also identify her as a director of Monticello plc, which became the centre of an investigation into share ramping after one of her co-directors, Mark O\u2019Hanlon, gave an interview in January 2000 in which he made false claims about the company\u2019s prospects. Monticello\u2019s share price subsequently skyrocketed and trading on its shares was suspended. Rudd resigned as a board member five months later, two days before she also resigned as director of Advanced Asset Allocation Management. The episode led the Department of Trade and Industry to investigate, and in 2007 O\u2019Hanlon was convicted of making a false statement and sentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. He was jailed again in June 2013 following an unrelated fraud conviction. Prior to Monticello, Rudd was involved in a number of other ventures. The Guardian can disclose she was: The executive director of Kensington Resources, a company headquartered in Mayfair in London that financed diamond prospecting in Saskatchewan, Canada. Appointed president in 1994 of another mining company, Siberian Pacific Resources Inc. Rudd raised 500,000 Canadian dollars for a joint venture with a group of Russian geologists searching for diamonds in Siberia. A director of The Zinc Corporation plc, a company exploring a new technique for zinc extraction. In 1997 the company hoped to go public on the lightly regulated stock exchange Ofex. However, the plans were dropped after it misplaced a cheque for \u00a312,500, according to an interview in which Rudd was quoted. Shortly after the company was bought by Monticello. Shares in both Kensington and Siberian were traded on the Vancouver Stock Exchange, which prior to its closure in 1999 had a reputation for being poorly regulated. A report commissioned by the finance ministry of British Columbia described a small number of successful enterprises \u201covershadowed by the continuing occurrence of shams, swindles and market manipulations\u201d. Rudd supported Cameron earlier this year after the Panama Papers revealed the inner workings of his father\u2019s Blairmore fund, which was run from the Bahamas and incorporated in Panama. Although legal, the unorthodox structure resulted in the fund paying no tax in Britain for three decades. When interviewed on BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show after Cameron admitted he had previously held shares in Blairmore, Rudd said: \u201cI think the key thing is here that the prime minister and his family paid the correct amount of tax that they were due.\u201d When asked if she had money in any offshore trusts herself, Rudd replied: \u201cI don\u2019t, no. But I\u2019m pleased to say that all MPs have a very transparent system. They have to disclose their funds, their income, and of course famously a very clear expenses regulatory system.\u201d She did not mention her previous role running a Bahamas fund. A spokesperson for the home secretary said: \u201cIt is a matter of public record that Amber had a career in business before entering politics. Monticello was thoroughly investigated 16 years ago and those who acted wrongly were identified and prosecuted.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Eight years ago this month, a bank collapsed, Wall Street went into meltdown and the world economy plunged into crisis. Trillions were lost in output ($22tn in the US, within just five years), millions of workers were made redundant (8.8 million in America\u2019s great recession, 1.2 million in the UK) and thousands of promises were made by politicians and policymakers \u2013 everyone from Barack Obama and Gordon Brown to David Cameron and Christine Lagarde \u2013 that things would change. Yet, nearly a decade later, what is most striking is how little has changed. In the US, the UK and the rest of the developed world, policymakers talk of the \u201cnew mediocre\u201d, so tepid is economic performance. And in the developing world things look even worse. Such is the message from two of the world\u2019s leading economic thinktanks, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). Both their reports on Wednesday were thick with cloud and short on silver lining. Yes, the OECD believes that Brexit Britain will have a slightly easier time this year \u2013 but that will be followed by a far choppier 2017. And the Unctad report is even more troubling. The biggest single warning it makes is that the world is on the verge of \u201centering a third phase of the financial crisis\u201d. What began in the US subprime housing market before roiling Europe\u2019s governments is likely to rear its head again \u2013 this time in Latin America, Africa and other poor countries. What will do for them, believe the Unctad researchers, is what also did for America and Europe: debt. Much of the cheap money created by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank has been pushed by financial speculators into the higher-yielding markets of South Africa, Brazil and India, among others. Economists at the Bank for International Settlements, the central banks\u2019 central bank, reckon that $9.8tn was pumped out in foreign bank loans and bonds in the first half-decade after the Lehman Brothers collapse. Unctad calculates that around $7tn of that was pushed through to emerging markets. By any standards, that is a flood of credit \u2013 one that was encouraged by panicky policymakers. Wasn\u2019t it the turn of China and the rest to pick up the slack in the global economy? Except now developing countries are lumbered with a gigantic private debt mountain to pay down. The private, non-financial sector across the developing world has debt service obligations worth nearly 150% of its income. The comparable figure for the developed world, by contrast, is just above 80%. And now developing countries are hobbling along rather than sprinting ahead, while commodity prices have tanked. To make matters worse, companies will typically have borrowed in US dollars and invested in their local currencies \u2013 but the strength of the dollar will make those loans all the harder to repay. This won\u2019t necessarily produce an all-out crisis, although Unctad isn\u2019t the only organisation sounding the alarm. But at the very least it will cause big problems and starve poor countries of much-needed investment. Cash used to pay off loans cannot be put towards new premises, kit, staff. And as the subprime and eurozone debacles have shown, private-sector debts that really can\u2019t be repaid have a nasty habit of ending up on the public balance sheet. The subprime crisis and the eurozone meltdown were both spun as morality tales: foolish borrowers buying houses they had no right to live in, feckless countries wasting euros on empty airports. Not much was said about the lenders. Doubtless it will be the same this time around. But what is really at fault here is an inadequate, unfair, ultimately self-defeating model of globalisation. For decades, the share of GDP going to workers across rich countries has been falling. Rich nations have hacked back social entitlements and public services in order to pay for tax cuts. And, notably in the US and the UK, executives have showered shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks, even while starving their businesses of investment. This same model has been urged on poor countries \u2013 and the result in both the global north and the global south has turned out to be big debt and disappointing growth. In the short term, America and Europe will need to do more to right the global economy, through fiscal stimulus and driving up wages \u2013 even if that causes financiers to protest. In the long run, this failed globalisation needs to be turned into something more sustainable and more inclusive, built on higher wages, robust tax systems and strong public safety nets.",

Economists at the Bank for International Settlements, the central banks\u2019 central bank, reckon that <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/publ/work483.htm\" title=\"\">$9.8tn was pumped out in foreign bank loans and bonds</a> in the first half-decade after the Lehman Brothers collapse. Unctad calculates that around $7tn of that was pushed through to emerging markets.</p> <p>By any standards, that is a flood of credit \u2013 one that was encouraged by panicky policymakers. Wasn\u2019t it the turn of China and the rest to pick up the slack in the global economy? Except now developing countries are lumbered with a gigantic private debt mountain to pay down. The private, non-financial sector across the developing world has debt service obligations worth nearly 150% of its income. The comparable figure for the developed world, by contrast, is just above 80%. And now developing countries are hobbling along rather than sprinting ahead, while commodity prices have tanked.</p> <p>To make matters worse, companies will typically have borrowed in US dollars and invested in their local currencies \u2013 but the strength of the dollar will make those loans all the harder to repay. This won\u2019t necessarily produce an all-out crisis, although Unctad isn\u2019t the only organisation sounding the alarm. But at the very least it will cause big problems and starve poor countries of much-needed investment. Cash used to pay off loans cannot be put towards new premises, kit, staff. And as the subprime and eurozone debacles have shown, private-sector debts that really can\u2019t be repaid have a nasty habit of ending up on the public balance sheet.</p> <p>The subprime crisis and the eurozone meltdown were both spun as morality tales: foolish borrowers buying houses they had no right to live in, feckless countries wasting euros on empty airports. Not much was said about the lenders. Doubtless it will be the same this time around. But what is really at fault here is an inadequate, unfair, ultimately self-defeating model of globalisation. For decades, the share of GDP going to workers across rich countries has been falling. Rich nations have hacked back social entitlements and public services in order to pay for tax cuts. And, notably in the US and the UK, executives have showered shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks, even while starving their businesses of investment.</p> <p>This same model has been urged on poor countries \u2013 and the result in both the global north and the global south has turned out to be big debt and disappointing growth. In the short term, America and Europe will need to do more to right the global economy, through fiscal stimulus and driving up wages \u2013 even if that causes financiers to protest. In the long run, this failed globalisation needs to be turned into something more sustainable and more inclusive, built on higher wages, robust tax systems and strong public safety nets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fears of a fresh debt crisis in developing countries that would send shockwaves through the global financial system have been highlighted by a United Nations report stressing the vulnerability of poor states to falling commodity prices and higher interest rates. The annual report from the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad) said the benefits of the debt relief provided to some of the world\u2019s poorest countries as a result of the mass public campaigns of the late-90s and early 2000s were \u201cfast evaporating\u201d. It said a number of countries \u2013 mainly in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 had been forced to seek help from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, adding that the international community needed to be better prepared to manage a new crisis. According to the IMF, 36 countries had received financial assistance worth $76bn under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country initiative, but Unctad said rushed attempts to integrate poorer countries into international financial markets after the 2008 global recession had left them vulnerable. \u201cEasy access to cheap credit in boom times has led to growing debt levels across the developing world. Developing country external debt stocks alone rose from $2.1tn in 2000 to $6.8tn in 2015, while overall debt levels rose by over $31tn between 2000 and 2014, with total debt-to-GDP ratios in many developing countries reaching over 120% and in some emerging economies over 200%.\u201d Many developing countries borrowed heavily when commodity prices were booming in the years after the 2008 financial crisis, and Unctad said the falling cost of oil, metals and food has made it harder for them to repay their debts. The threat of higher US interest rates after a prolonged period of sluggish growth in the west would add to the problems of the most heavily exposed countries, it said. \u201cOnly a couple of years ago, the amount of debt that low-income developing countries could have sold to eager investors seemed almost limitless. International sovereign bond issuance in these economies rose from a mere $2bn in 2009 to almost $18bn in 2014,\u201d Unctad said. \u201cBut a prolonged commodity price shock, steep currency depreciations and worsening growth prospects in a deteriorating global economic environment have quickly driven up borrowing costs and debt-to-GDP ratios.\u201d The risk of a new debt crisis will be discussed when the IMF and the Bank hold their annual meetings in Washington next month. Unctad expects growth in Africa this year to be 2.8%, less than half the 6.7% recorded in 2010. Over the same period, growth in the world economy had eased from 4.1% to a predicted 2.3% this year. \u201cIf the global economy were to slow down more sharply, a significant share of developing country debt incurred since 2008 \u2013 not only debt issued and held within the borders of individual economies, but also cross-border debt, including debt accumulated by private residents and governments \u2013 could become unpayable and exert considerable pressure on the financial system. Thus, the international community will need to to prepare itself for managing debt work-outs in a faster, fairer and more orderly manner than it has done so far,\u201d it said. \u201cAlready, several countries have turned to multilateral lending institutions, such as the IMF and the World Bank, in order to obtain financial assistance: Angola, Azerbaijan, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Zambia and Zimbabwe have already asked for bailouts or are in talks to do so.\u201d The trade and development report said that against a backdrop of falling commodity prices and slackening growth in the developed world, borrowing costs for poor countries had been \u201cdriven up very quickly, turning what seemed reasonable debt burdens under favourable conditions into largely unsustainable debt. \u201cBut the pro-cyclical nature of capital flows \u2013 cheap during a boom and expensive during downturns \u2013 is not the only drawback. Once a crisis looms, currency devaluations to improve export prospects simultaneously increase the value of foreign currency denominated debt.\u201d Unctad said developing countries had thought for a time that they were decoupled from the slow growth in the west, but were \u201cincreasingly worried that policy actions in the latter could trigger a deflationary spiral and a new round of debt crises\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Majestic Wine\u2019s share price has plunged more than 25% after the company issued a profit warning because of a failed marketing campaign in the US and weak sales to business customers. Britain\u2019s biggest specialist wine retailer said it had overspent on testing a direct mailing campaign at Naked Wines in the US. The company has stopped the initiative, but said in the short term it would mean higher costs in the first half of the year. Majestic said it would miss profit expectations for the year ending next April. The gloomy trading update sent the company\u2019s share price down by 25% in early trading on Wednesday, to 325p. The chief executive, Rowan Gormley, said: \u201cNo one likes to see the share price go down, but the long-term outlook is what matters.\u201d He said that while Majestic was operating in a tough market, there was no discernible impact as yet from the Brexit vote in June and consumer spending remained unchanged. He warned, however, that the weaker pound \u2013 which makes imports more expensive \u2013 could mean higher prices have to be passed on to customers in the future. \u201cIf the pound remains down over the long term, at some point wine prices will have to go up to reflect that, and that will be the same for all retailers. Prices will have to adjust,\u201d Gormley said. In April 2015, Majestic bought Naked Wines, an online retailer that lets subscribers fund independent winemakers in exchange for purchases of exclusive bottles at preferential prices. Gormley was its founder, and became Majestic\u2019s CEO when the deal occurred. After making an unexpected profit for Majestic last year, Naked Wines is expected to make a small loss in the current financial year. Majestic said the second factor weighing on full-year profits was weak growth in its commercial division, which sells wine to businesses. It said conditions had become more challenging, with sales flat in the first half of the year. The company needed to find a better, more profitable way forward for the commercial business, it said. The combination of weak sales and the failed direct mailing test meant profits in the year to 3 April 2017 would be lower than current market expectations of \u00a316.1m, Majestic said. Gormley added: \u201cIt is very disappointing that two isolated factors are distracting from the great progress across the rest of the group. We have always said that we would adopt a test and learn approach, and be quick to redeploy capital from underperforming areas, which is exactly what we are doing. \u201cWhile this approach is delivering good results in the other business units, the scale of the US market means that even a test can have a material effect on profits.\u201d Gormley said the turnaround plan for its retail business \u2013 which includes 210 stores in the UK \u2013 was progressing well, and preparations for the peak Christmas trading period were \u201cwell in hand\u201d. He pledged to revive Majestic after several years of disappointing results and abandoned a minimum six-bottle purchase rule left over from its days as a warehouse, simplified prices and updated the range of drinks. Naked Wines in the UK and Australia, and the underlying business in the US, were trading well, he said. Despite the profit warning, Majestic said it was on track to resume dividend payments this year and to achieve its goal of \u00a3500m sales by 2019. In the year to 28 March 2016, sales were \u00a3402m. Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex, said: \u201cIt looked like someone at Majestic Wine had smashed a crate of claret over its chart on Wednesday, with the stock plunging 25%. \u201cAt the time, the Majestic Wine/Naked Wines merger was celebrated as a savvy consolidation of the two companies; now, however, it looks like Rowan Gormley may be pushing the firm to expand too quickly, resulting in the direct mail mess in the US.\u201d",

The company has stopped the initiative, but said in the short term it would mean higher costs in the first half of the year.<br></p> <p>Majestic said it would miss profit expectations for the year ending next April. The gloomy trading update sent the company\u2019s share price down by 25% in early trading on Wednesday, to 325p.</p> <p>The chief executive, Rowan Gormley, said: \u201cNo one likes to see the share price go down, but the long-term outlook is what matters.\u201d</p> <p>He said that while Majestic was operating in a tough market, there was no discernible impact as yet from the Brexit vote in June and consumer spending remained unchanged.</p> <p>He warned, however, that the weaker pound \u2013 which makes imports more expensive \u2013 could mean higher prices have to be passed on to customers in the future. \u201cIf the pound remains down over the long term, at some point wine prices will have to go up to reflect that, and that will be the same for all retailers. Prices will have to adjust,\u201d Gormley said. </p> <p>In April 2015, Majestic bought Naked Wines, an online retailer that lets subscribers fund independent winemakers in exchange for purchases of exclusive bottles at preferential prices.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Consumers across Europe should be able to pay the same for using their mobile phones abroad as they do in their home country for an unlimited number of days, under plans being debated by the European commission as it tries to abolish roaming charges. The commission discussed new proposals on Wednesday as part of an EU plan to abolish roaming charges by June 2017, after Brussels officials were forced into a U-turn. Roaming charges have become a political football, as the EU executive searches for ways to give the European project more popular appeal amid the eurozone debt crisis and Brexit negotiations. The cost of sending messages and making calls abroad has been slashed by more than 90% since the EU began capping roaming charges in 2007. Now the commission wants to phase out roaming charges entirely by next year. But Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, ordered his officials to rewrite the draft plans after deeming they did not go far enough. Under a previous draft, telecoms companies would have been allowed to charge people more for using their phones abroad for more than 90 days a year. But Juncker ordered his officials to go back to the drawing board, after criticism from members of the European parliament. The change has alarmed the telecoms industry, which argued that 90 days was already stretching the definition of periodic travelling. The average EU citizen is abroad for 12 days a year and only 0.1% of European consumers will be affected by abolishing the 90-day cap. Andrus Ansip, a European commission vice-president, said the earlier plan had not won support. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t accepted by member states or service providers. It was one idea, [but] it didn\u2019t fly.\u201d Mobile phone costs vary significantly across the 28-country bloc, with prices in Latvia more than six times cheaper than in Ireland. Phone companies are concerned the law would mean consumers could buy cheap sim cards in one country and use them permanently in another. They claim cheaper companies would be saddled with the higher costs of customers who are not genuinely roaming. In response, the commission has promised to introduce safeguards: telecoms companies would be able to check on consumers who appear to be permanently roaming and charge them more. Customers will be able to complain to national telecoms regulators if they dispute the charges. Consumer groups argue that phone users face unjustified costs. One survey cited by the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) found that roaming calls could cost up to \u20ac2 (\u00a31.70) a minute \u2013 20 times more than the cost of making a domestic call. Monique Goyens, the BEUC director general, welcomed the decision to drop time limits on roaming. \u201cConsumers should be able to make phone calls, send messages and use the internet for the entirety of their stay abroad and not be charged additional costs when travelling for a long period of time, working or studying in another EU country.\u201d But questions remain about how abuse of the proposed regime will be defined and policed. Phone operators will be responsible for checking suspected abuse, but industry sources say this raises many practical difficulties, such as checking residence when a British student is doing a six-month course in Germany. \u201cThe burden is on the operator to check \u2026 and I don\u2019t know what we will do,\u201d one industry source said. \u201cWill we have to ask for the certificate from the university?\u201d The European Telecommunications Network Operators\u2019 Association, which represents providers including T-Mobile and Orange, said: \u201cA careful evaluation of all the technical, legal and economic aspects of this decision is vital.\u201d The commission will announce detailed proposals in mid-December, after consultation with telecoms regulators and EU member states. Roaming charges also feature among the many unanswered questions about Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. If the UK were to remain a member of the European Economic Area, which includes all EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, British consumers would continue to benefit from the abolition of roaming charges. But a more detached relationship with the EU could lead to Britons paying higher prices to use their phones on the continent. Swiss consumers pay more for data roaming than any other member state, according to the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications. Swiss phone users pay 35 eurocents per megabyte of data when using their phones abroad, compared with an average of 6-7 eurocents across the European Economic Area. The Bruegel thinktank, which drew attention to the issue in a recent article, concluded that British consumers would pay more to roam after Brexit. It remained \u201ca safe bet\u201d that UK residents with UK mobile subscriptions would pay more for using their phone in Europe than EEA citizens would pay, it said.",

      "bodyText": "Inditex, the company behind the fashion brand Zara, has said sales and profits rose in the first half of the year as it prioritised big flagship stores and online expansion. The Spanish group, the world\u2019s biggest clothing retailer, reported an 8% increase in net profits in the six months ending 31 July to \u20ac1.26bn (\u00a31bn), beating analysts\u2019 expectations. Total net sales over the period increased by 11% to \u20ac10.47bn. Zara\u2019s floral dresses and tops, jumpsuits and oversized sweaters were popular sellers over the period, Inditex said. Like-for-like sales, stripping out the impact of shops open for less than a year, also increased by 11%, with growth across all regions. Europe, excluding Spain, saw the strongest sales growth, at 43%. The company said all its brands expanded internationally, with 83 shops opening in 38 countries over the first half, taking the total number of stores to 7,096. Other brands in the group include Massimo Dutti, Pull&amp;Bear, and Bershka. Led by Zara, Inditex has shifted its focus to opening larger stores in prime locations, including a new branch spread across five floors in the Galician city of La Coru\u00f1a, close to the group\u2019s headquarters. It is also taking its online shops to more countries, with 11 new locations opening in the first half, mainly in eastern Europe. Zara\u2019s automated production process allows it to quickly respond to changing trends and weather. Richard Chamberlain, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the results were better than expected, driven by a strong summer performance at Zara. \u201cIn particular we think Inditex has benefited from being able to offer a high amount of newness compared to the average apparel retailer,\u201d he said. \u201c[We] expect it to continue to take like-for-like share in fragmented apparel markets worldwide, on account of its strong multichannel offer and its superior ability to respond to trends in season.\u201d Inditex said it had created almost 10,000 jobs over the first half the year, with more than 2,400 of them in Spain. Zara was founded by Amancio Ortega, who opened the first store in La Coru\u00f1a in 1975. He is currently the world\u2019s second richest man, with a fortune of $77.4bn (\u00a359.6bn), according to Forbes.",

Other brands in the group include Massimo Dutti, Pull&amp;Bear, and Bershka.</p> <p>Led by Zara, Inditex has shifted its focus to opening larger stores in prime locations, including a new branch spread across five floors in the Galician city of La Coru\u00f1a, close to the group\u2019s headquarters.</p> <p>It is also taking its online shops to more countries, with 11 new locations opening in the first half, mainly in eastern Europe. Zara\u2019s automated production process allows it to quickly respond to changing trends and weather.</p> <p>Richard Chamberlain, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the results were better than expected, driven by a strong summer performance at Zara.</p> <p>\u201cIn particular we think Inditex has benefited from being able to offer a high amount of newness compared to the average apparel retailer,\u201d he said. \u201c[We] expect it to continue to take like-for-like share in fragmented apparel markets worldwide, on account of its strong multichannel offer and its superior ability to respond to trends in season.\u201d</p> <p>Inditex said it had created almost 10,000 jobs over the first half the year, with more than 2,400 of them in Spain.</p> <p>Zara was founded by Amancio Ortega, who opened the first store in La Coru\u00f1a in 1975. He is currently the world\u2019s second richest man, with a fortune of $77.4bn (\u00a359.6bn), according to Forbes.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of EpiPen manufacturer Mylan Pharmaceuticals will attempt to shift blame for the company\u2019s decision to implement huge price hikes on its lifesaving devices to health insurers and others at a congressional hearing Wednesday. Heather Bresch, chief executive of Mylan, is set to appear before Congress to explain Mylan\u2019s pricing of EpiPen and the profits the company has made off of the device. Mylan came under scrutiny after it was reported that the company had increased the price of its devices, used to treat life-threatening allergic reaction, from $56.64 in 2007 to $317.82. Since EpiPens are usually sold as a two-pack, the total cost can be more than $600. In her testimony to the House committee on oversight and government reform, Bresch is set to defend the price increases, noting that Mylan only makes about $50 in profit per pen while making the life-saving device available and raising awareness about anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is an allergic reaction that causes one\u2019s airways to swell and close. Epinephrine, a drug which is used to treat anaphylaxis, is cheap but must be delivered in the proper dose. Mylan\u2019s EpiPen quickly delivers a proper dose of epinephrine in emergency situations. \u201cFor millions of families, the presence of an EpiPen Auto-Injector in a purse, briefcase, backpack or medicine cabinet is a source of enormous comfort and an invaluable insurance policy against a potential tragic event. It troubles me greatly that the EpiPen product has become a source of controversy,\u201d Bresch wrote in prepared testimony released ahead of the meeting. \u201cAt the same time, the issue of EpiPens has two equally critical dimensions \u2013 price and access. With the current focus on pricing, I\u2019m very concerned that the access part of the equation is being minimized.\u201d According to Bresch, Mylan has reached more than 80% more patients. She added that \u201capproximately 85% of EpiPen patients pay less than $100 for a two-unit package and a majority pay less than $50\u201d. EpiPen is not the only product whose price Mylan has hiked. According to an investors\u2019 note by a Wells Fargo senior analyst, David Maris, this year Mylan hiked prices of two dozen products by 20%. Since the drugs are used to treat afflictions such as irritable bowel syndrome, overactive bladder and gallstones, there was little coverage or outcry. Mylan has insisted that its business model is not premised on price hikes and that the price hikes are due to the increase in costs of doing business in the US healthcare system. In August, Bresch compared healthcare to the mortgage crisis. She explained that since EpiPens passed through various \u201chands\u201d, such as retailers and pharmacy benefits managers, the cost became inflated by the time they reached the counters. \u201cWhat Mylan takes from that, our net sales is $274, so $137 per pen,\u201d she said at the time. On Wednesday, she attempted to once again explain the profit that Mylan makes off of EpiPens. \u201cI think many people incorrectly assume we make $600 off each EpiPen. This is simply not true. In the complicated world of pharmaceutical pricing, there is something known as the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or WAC. The WAC for a two-unit pack of EpiPen Auto-Injectors is $608,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter rebates and various fees, Mylan actually receives $274. Then you must subtract our cost of goods, which is $69. This leaves a balance of $205. After subtracting all EpiPen Auto-Injector related costs, our profit is $100, or approximately $50 per pen.\u201d That\u2019s slightly less than the $56.64 that EpiPen cost when Mylan acquired its maker, Merck KGaA, in 2007.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) from June 2006 to May 2009: Markets don\u2019t like uncertainty or surprises. The Brexit vote was a shock that immediately caused a big drop in the pound which today is trading below $1.30 and likely headed lower. Both Fitch and S&amp;P have downgraded the UK\u2019s credit rating. The value of the UK\u2019s holdings of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are down by around a quarter since the vote. The Bank of England\u2019s Agents\u2019 survey of companies gathered since the referendum indicated the result of the vote would have a negative effect overall on capital spending, hiring and turnover over the coming year. Business and consumer confidence collapsed in July but picked up in August after the Bank of England sensibly cut interest rates and started a new round of quantitative easing. They seem to have learned from their failures to act early in 2008. The collapse in business and consumer confidence data from April 2008 was the earliest signal that the Great Recession had started. So it was sensible for the MPC to act when they collapsed after the Brexit vote and not to wait, as some have suggested, for the \u201chard data\u201d. The chart below illustrates that doing that in 2008 meant missing the start of a once in a hundred years recession by over a year. It plots the revisions for GDP growth in the second quarter (Q2) of 2008. In June 2008 the Office for National Statistics published its first estimate of GDP growth for Q2 2008 at +0.2%. In August 2008 it cut the estimate to zero but then cut it to -0.1% in June 2009. The latest estimate today is -0.6%. My worry is that there is a lot of bad news to come. It is good to get your retaliation in first. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Watch this space. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC and member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee from October 2006 to May 2011: I believe the Bank should have held fire until it had more evidence on how the economy would respond to the post-Brexit shock. There is a genuine danger of unintended adverse consequences from their current policy. Bond yields have fallen further and pension fund deficits have widened by \u00a3100bn, according to PwC estimates. Monetary policy has become too preoccupied with short-term issues since the financial crisis and is not focused on the longer-term goal of ensuring a balanced recovery and ensuring that savers can expect reasonable returns to provide income in retirement. The difficult process of gradually raising interest rates is always put off to another day in the future. The early indicators about the growth of the UK economy since the Brexit vote have been mixed. The economy seems to have rebounded after the shock to confidence in July, helped by the stabilisation in the political situation. Retail sales and other measures of consumer spending have held up reasonably well. But estimates for the overall growth of the economy in the third quarter point to an increase of just 0.2-0.3% over the previous quarter \u2013 equivalent to an annual growth rate of about 1%. That would represent a significant slowdown from the 2.2% growth we saw in the year before the Brexit vote. We don\u2019t yet have much hard evidence on the performance of investment, which is the area of the economy which was expected to be hit hardest by Brexit uncertainty. But business surveys are showing much softer investment intentions across all sectors of the economy. So it is still reasonable to expect the investment-driven slowdown in growth next year which most forecasters are expecting. Another factor which is expected to hold back growth next year is the squeeze on spending power from rising inflation. Headline measures of inflation are not yet reflecting the very substantial fall in the pound over the past 12 months. But that is only a matter of time. Sterling shows little sign of any rebound from its post-referendum level of around $1.30 and \u20ac1.15. The UK\u2019s trade-weighted exchange has fallen by over 15% in the past year and its average level in August was the fourth lowest for any month since 1980. I am sceptical that this will do much to boost exports, however. The UK\u2019s main exports are high value-added manufactures and services, neither of which are price-sensitive. The MPC\u2019s decision to cut interest rates and inject more quantitative easing has added to the weakness of sterling and it is far from clear it will help the economy in the transition to Brexit. The resilience shown by the latest housing market indicators suggest there is a real risk that we will see a further surge in house prices on the back of extremely low interest rates, adding to the imbalances which have been apparent in the UK economy for many years.",

The Brexit vote was a shock that immediately caused a big drop in the pound which today is trading below $1.30 and likely headed lower. Both Fitch and S&amp;P have downgraded the UK\u2019s credit rating. The value of the UK\u2019s holdings of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are down by around a quarter since the vote. The Bank of England\u2019s Agents\u2019 survey of companies gathered since the referendum indicated the result of the vote would have a negative effect overall on capital spending, hiring and turnover over the coming year. Business and consumer confidence collapsed in July but picked up in August after the Bank of England sensibly cut interest rates and started a new round of quantitative easing. They seem to have learned from their failures to act early in 2008.<br></p> <p>The collapse in business and consumer confidence data from April 2008 was the earliest signal that the Great Recession had started. So it was sensible for the MPC to act when they collapsed after the Brexit vote and not to wait, as some have suggested, for the \u201chard data\u201d. The chart below illustrates that doing that in 2008 meant missing the start of a once in a hundred years recession by over a year. It plots the revisions for GDP growth in the second quarter (Q2) of 2008. In June 2008 the Office for National Statistics published its first estimate of GDP growth for Q2 2008 at +0.2%. In August 2008 it cut the estimate to zero but then cut it to -0.1% in June 2009. The latest estimate today is -0.6%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2016/sep/21/how-has-the-brexit-vote-affected-the-uk-economy-september-verdict\">How has the Brexit vote affected the UK economy?

There is a genuine danger of unintended adverse consequences from their current policy. Bond yields have fallen further and pension fund deficits have widened by \u00a3100bn, according to PwC estimates.</p> <p>Monetary policy has become too preoccupied with short-term issues since the financial crisis and is not focused on the longer-term goal of ensuring a balanced recovery and ensuring that savers can expect reasonable returns to provide income in retirement. The difficult process of gradually raising interest rates is always put off to another day in the future.</p> <p>The early indicators about the growth of the UK economy since the Brexit vote have been mixed. The economy seems to have rebounded after the shock to confidence in July, helped by the stabilisation in the political situation. Retail sales and other measures of consumer spending have held up reasonably well. But estimates for the overall growth of the economy in the third quarter point to an increase of just 0.2-0.3% over the previous quarter \u2013 equivalent to an annual growth rate of about 1%.

      "bodyText": "The west\u2019s leading economic thinktank has backtracked on its warning that the UK would suffer instant damage from a Brexit vote and has thrown its weight behind plans by Theresa May to provide fresh post-referendum support to growth in November\u2019s autumn statement. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which issued strong warnings about the likely impact of a vote to leave the EU ahead of the 23 June vote, has revised up its forecast for growth this year as a result of a stronger-than expected performance in the first half of 2016 and action by the Bank of England in August to spur activity. Until recently a staunch supporter of George Osborne\u2019s austerity plan, the OECD said it was appropriate for the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, to increase public spending in his first major policy statement later this year. It said it was still predicting a sharp slowdown in the economy, but that this would not happen until 2017. It said that the expected negative effects on the rest of the global economy of the Brexit vote \u2013 compared in June to the equivalent of a hard landing for China \u2013 had also been delayed. The referendum result had led to high volatility in financial markets and a rise in uncertainty, the OECD said in its interim economic outlook. \u201cWhile markets have since stabilised, sterling has depreciated by around 10% in trade-weighted terms since the referendum. For 2016, GDP growth has been supported by a strong performance prior to the referendum, even though business investment contracted. \u201cDevelopments to date are broadly consistent with the more moderate scenarios set out prior to the referendum and reflect prompt action by the Bank of England in August. However, GDP is projected to slow to 1% in 2017, well below the pace in recent years and forecasts prior to the referendum. \u201cSpillovers to the global economy, notably the euro area, have been modest so far, including through confidence and financial markets weighing on investment; more negative effects on the euro area are likely to become apparent in 2017.\u201d The OECD\u2019s current assessment contrasts with the comments made by its secretary general Angel Gurria in April when he said: \u201cFrom the moment of a Brexit vote until the arrangements for \u2018divorce\u2019 are definitively settled \u2013 years later there would be heightened economic uncertainty, with damaging consequences. Brexit would lead to a sell-off of assets and a sharp rise in risk premia. Consumer confidence would fall, as would business confidence and investment, thus holding back growth.\u201d Catherine Mann, the OECD\u2019s chief economist said it was premature to say there would be no possible consequences for the UK from Brexit and that its pre-referendum estimates had taken no account of possible policy changes by the Bank of England and the Treasury. \u201cWhen we made our forecasts we did not presume to speak about what the Bank of England might do. The Bank entered the market forcibly on interest rates and to calm the markets,\u201d she said. \u201cNor did we presume to make any judgements about what fiscal policy might do,\u201d she added, noting that Hammond had signalled higher public spending in the autumn statement. \u201cIt all adds up to appropriate policy support.\u201d The OECD said it expected the UK economy to grow by 1.8% this year, a 0.1 point increase on its pre-referendum estimate, but then fall by more than it had previously envisaged. It also shaved its world growth estimates for both 2016 and 2017 by 0.1 point, to 2.9% and 3.2% respectively. Mann said it was right to say that the OECD, hitherto a strong supporter of austerity policies in the UK and elsewhere in the developed world, was \u201cchanging its tune\u201d. She said there were three reasons for the rethink: countries had implemented a lot of austerity; global growth was flat-lining, and ultra-low interest rates had created conditions in which governments could borrow cheaply. Action was needed to lift the global economy out of a low-growth trap, she said. \u201cThe spiral is not upwards, it is downwards. Downwards on trade, downwards on productivity, downwards on global growth.\u201d The OECD fears that weak growth, stagnant living standards and rising inequality are eroding support for globalisation and making it harder for governments to pursue structural reforms. \u201cAll countries have room to restructure their spending and tax policies towards a more growth-friendly mix by increasing hard and soft infrastructure spending, and using fiscal measures to support structural reforms\u201d the interim outlook said. \u201cConcrete instruments include greater spending on well-targeted active labour market programmes and basic research, which should benefit both short-term demand, longer-term supply, and help to make growth more inclusive.\u201d",

The OECD says global trade is only inching ahead and will restrict GDP growth in 2017 for the global economy to 3.2%, up slightly from 2.9% this year. The UK is faring even worse. It will grow only 1% next year after struggling to 1.8% in 2016. It is clear why Britain will suffer in 2017 after reading the latest reports by Bank of England agents, which show that investment and employment are expected to flatline over the next year. Anxious businesses are preparing to hunker down and continue to run their operations as before, but forget about any plans for expansion. The future is too uncertain. Making matters worse, a modest improvement in public finances in August failed to get the government\u2019s borrowing back on track, leaving the chancellor, Philip Hammond, with a bigger deficit than projected in the March budget. Yet the UK, like most of Europe, is a net importer of oil and was due to enjoy a dividend from lower prices. Oil remains the lubricant of global business and was largely to blame for corporate woes when it reached $115 a barrel between 2010 and 2013. Then came the China slowdown and the price of the black stuff plummeted. To some extent, Britain\u2019s boom in 2014-15 was built on the oil bonus that fed directly into household disposable incomes. It saved the eurozone from further stagnation. At prices below $50 a barrel, that dividend means households and businesses are paying much less for their fuel than three years ago, and both should feel good about the prospects for their finances. The OECD blames the fact that they do not feel that way on the British vote to leave the EU. It also criticises western governments for their refusal to spend on new infrastructure to boost growth and confidence levels. Such a move would make up for the abject failure since the financial crash of private companies to invest in new plant and machinery, and outside the tech field to try out new techniques and processes that would raise productivity and wages. The OECD boss, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, might expect the 34 countries that count themselves as members of his organisation to heed his advice and step into the space left by the private sector. After all, they pay his wages. Yet they are also too anxious to make more than token gestures. He says the UK has headroom to spend without spooking the markets, but Hammond is not concerned about the markets. He is concerned about his electorate and the prospect that voters will consider him profligate if he goes on a spending spree. So the need to shore up weak public finances is likely to trump reports that private investment and employment have stagnated.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Why is everyone talking about the Federal Reserve? Because today\u2019s the day the US central bank will decide, once again, whether or not to raise interest rates. Fed chair Janet Yellen will hold a press conference to discuss the Fed\u2019s assessment of the US economy. When was the last time the Fed raised rates? The Fed raised rates last December for the first time since 2006. It was expected to be the first of a series of rises but the Fed has declined to raise them again at six subsequent meetings. They remain pretty close to 0%, where they have been since before the recession. Why do I care? It\u2019s the economy, stupid. We are in an election cycle and the economy is likely to be the deciding factor. As Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders and plenty of others have argued by keeping the interest rates low, the Fed has created a \u201cfalse economy\u201d flooding the market with cheap money, via ultra-low interest rates, and driving stock markets to unsustainable highs (emphasis on the unsustainable). Fat cats and big shareholders may have benefited from the recovery but a lot of Americans feel like they have been left behind or feel insecure about the gains they have made. How will they feel if it turns out the Fed has fuelled another boom and bust cycle? That does not sound good It\u2019s not. The Fed lowers interest rates in the hopes of encouraging people to spend more money and for businesses to revive the economy by hiring new people. What it doesn\u2019t want to do is create bubbles. Bubbles burst. The policy does seem to have worked, albeit slowly. The job market has rebounded and consumers are spending more. Still the majority of the people on the Fed\u2019s board have not felt the economy was strong enough to take another rate hike. At the same time US stock markets have all hit record highs this year as investors have poured money into the markets looking for returns they can\u2019t find in low interest rates. If there is a shock to the system now, a cut to interest rates that are already close to zero is unlikely to save the day again. Uh-oh Exactly. This is why some members of the Federal Reserve and other economists have said that it is time to raise interest rates. In August, New York Fed president William Dudley said that a September rate hike \u201cis possible\u201d. Dudley is part of the federal open markets committee, which votes on whether to raise interest rates or not. \u201cLet\u2019s get on with it already,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. So they will raise interest rates today \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Seriously \u2026 Probably not today. I will echo the Royal Bank of Canada here: if the Fed hikes interest rates today, it will be the mother of all surprises. But didn\u2019t Janet Yellen say something about the case for rate hike strengthening last month? She did. She has also spent a couple of the past months praising the US jobs market, which over the past three months has created on average 230,000 jobs a month, but there are other things to consider. Like what? Well, inflation is still really low. And wages are not that great. These are both good enough of an excuse for the Fed to hold off on raising rates for another few months. So when will the interest rates go up? The Fed meets again in November \u2013 a week before election \u2013 which might make them pause for thought. The Fed is not supposed to be political but if a rate rise triggers a stock market crash just before the election \u2026 Yellen and crew meet again in December and economists are betting that December will be THE month. Happy Holidays! Let\u2019s hope so.",

      "bodyText": "Businesses across the UK are scaling back investment plans and imposing freezes on recruitment as the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote reverberates through the British economy. The Bank of England\u2019s summary of business conditions, based on reports from regional agents, said \u201cinvestment intentions had fallen since the EU referendum\u201d and pointed to \u201cbroadly flat business investment over the next year\u201d. In stark contrast to July\u2019s agents\u2019 report, which found employers were bouyant about their prospects, the September report said employers were circumspect about taking on new staff and in many sectors were only hiring \u201cwhere the business case was strong\u201d. The report will make sobering read for Philip Hammond as he prepares his autumn statement in November. The chancellor is already under pressure to ease austerity measures and find ways to boost public investment in infrastructure and vital services such as the NHS. Without an increase in private investment, Hammond will need to deploy more funds from the exchequer to generate a substantial increase in investment, especially in depressed areas outside London and the south-east. Last week the Bank left base rates unchanged at 0.25%, though it hinted that a deterioration in economic conditions over the next six months could lead to a further rate cut. Its agents said large-scale private sector projects were \u201cbeing challenged more rigorously and, in some cases, being scaled back or deferred\u201d. \u201cProjects already underway were largely continuing, however, and contacts across all sectors were still investing to generate cost efficiencies and increase productivity. \u201cThe slowing in capital spending had been most pronounced among companies providing professional services to the commercial real estate market. In contrast, investment among consumer services firms had remained more resilient,\u201d the report said. In tune with official surveys, the report found most retailers enjoyed modest growth during the summer months, and consumer services continued to expand. The cheaper pound helped manufacturers lift exports and gave a boost to services firms operating overseas. But revenue growth in domestic business services firms slowed over the past three months. \u201cThat had mainly reflected heightened uncertainty, which had reduced demand for a range of professional and financial services,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn particular, haulage and distribution companies reported a weakening of turnover growth, as companies sought to keep stock levels low to preserve cash in the face of higher uncertainty. Publishing and broadcasting contacts had seen advertising revenues weaken. Services exports growth had picked up moderately.\u201d A slowdown in the housing market also caused a ripple of anxiety across most business sectors, the report said, triggering cutbacks in investment and a weaker jobs market.",

      "body": "<p>Businesses across the UK are scaling back investment plans and imposing freezes on recruitment as the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote reverberates through the British economy.</p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s summary of business conditions, based on reports from regional agents, said \u201cinvestment intentions had fallen since the EU referendum\u201d and pointed to \u201cbroadly flat business investment over the next year\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/20/bank-of-england-agents-report-business-as-usual-after-brexit-eu-referendum\">In stark contrast to July\u2019s agents\u2019 report</a>, which found employers were bouyant about their prospects, the September report said employers were circumspect about taking on new staff and in many sectors were only hiring \u201cwhere the business case was strong\u201d. </p> <p>The report will make sobering read for Philip Hammond as he prepares his autumn statement in November. The chancellor is already under pressure to ease austerity measures and find ways to boost public investment in infrastructure and vital services such as the NHS.</p> <p>Without an increase in private investment, Hammond will need to deploy more funds from the exchequer to generate a substantial increase in investment, especially in depressed areas outside London and the south-east.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/bank-of-england-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged\">Last week the Bank left base rates unchanged at 0.25%</a>, though it hinted that a deterioration in economic conditions over the next six months could lead to a further rate cut.</p> <p>Its agents said large-scale private sector projects were \u201cbeing challenged more rigorously and, in some cases, being scaled back or deferred\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cProjects already underway were largely continuing, however, and contacts across all sectors were still investing to generate cost efficiencies and increase productivity. </p> <p>\u201cThe slowing in capital spending had been most pronounced among companies providing professional services to the commercial real estate market. In contrast, investment among consumer services firms had remained more resilient,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>In tune with official surveys, the report found most retailers enjoyed modest growth during the summer months, and consumer services continued to expand.</p> <p>The cheaper pound helped manufacturers lift exports and gave a boost to services firms operating overseas.</p> <p>But revenue growth in domestic business services firms slowed over the past three months. \u201cThat had mainly reflected heightened uncertainty, which had reduced demand for a range of professional and financial services,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>\u201cIn particular, haulage and distribution companies reported a weakening of turnover growth, as companies sought to keep stock levels low to preserve cash in the face of higher uncertainty. Publishing and broadcasting contacts had seen advertising revenues weaken. Services exports growth had picked up moderately.\u201d</p> <p>A slowdown in the housing market also caused a ripple of anxiety across most business sectors, the report said, triggering cutbacks in investment and a weaker jobs market.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imperial Brands, the tobacco group behind Lambert &amp; Butler, Gauloises and Rizla, is leading the FTSE 100 fallers after a broker downgrade. Its shares hit an all time-high last month as investors snapped them up for their dividend yield, but are now down 80p at \u00a339.27. The fall follows analysts at Credit Suisse cutting their recommendation from outperform to neutral and their target price from \u00a342.50 to \u00a340. They expected 2017 to be a challenging year after the initial benefits of Imperial\u2019s \u00a34.2bn purchase of four brands following the merger of US groups Reynolds and Lorillard last year. They said: A combination of a low take-out multiple, cheap debt and strengthening dollar means we estimate the Lorillard acquisition will have added 23% to earnings (and a similar increment in free cash flow) by the end of 2016. However looking into 2017 the \u2018Lorillard story\u2019 will have largely run its course (with a risk that Winston/Kool\u2019s momentum slows as the impact of the price reset subsides) and we anticipate a significant headwind in the UK. The deep- discount segment\u2019s share of the market is growing rapidly (which is lowering the average selling price) even before the \u2018sticker shock\u2019 of moving to packs of 20 sticks and standardising packaging (by May 2017). Disconcertingly, although over-indexed in the deep discount segment Imperial is currently losing market share... We anticipate Phillip Morris, BAT and Japan Tobacco will increasingly redeploy some of their premium and mainstream brands into the value segment, where Imperial is currently over-represented (with a still relatively fragmented brand portfolio). In contrast, analysts at Jefferies were positive on the company: We assume coverage of Imperial with a buy, a target price of 4600p and 12 month total shareholder return of around 20%. While not peer best, we believe actions the company has taken has positioned it well to deliver earnings per share growth of mid single digit over the medium to long term. This in turn should support a continued 10% dividend increase each year. We still believe the valuation is yet to be given full credit for this attractive returns outlook. Elsewhere Sainsbury\u2019s is up 4.4p at 248.9p despite some ambivalence in a report from Barclays analysts: The investment case on Sainsbury is intriguing, in our view, with potentially strong arguments on both sides. The core Sainsbury business is seeing relatively weaker sales trends than for some years, but this is to some extent the inevitable result of ending multibuy offers and may not be such bad news for the bottom line as the top line. We struggle to feel comfortable about the underlying outlook for the acquired Argos business but can see that synergies could more than compensate for foreign exchange and consumer headwinds. Sainsbury has significant pension liabilities but offers a free cash flow yield of around 9-10%. The shares are heavily shorted but have underperformed Morrison by a remarkable 50 percentage points year to date. If Sainsbury can provide visibility on earnings then upside could be considerable, but we fear this may be difficult until at least Christmas is out of the way and we have a better picture of Argos\u2019 profitability. We reiterate our equal weight rating and our price target of 270p.",

      "bodyText": "Government borrowing was a touch higher than expected in August as the chancellor prepares to blow deficit targets further off course in his maiden autumn statement in November. Borrowing was \u00a310.5bn last month, higher than the \u00a310bn predicted by City economists but \u00a3900m lower than the same month a year ago according to the Office for National Statistics. It helped to reduce the deficit for the financial year, from April to August, to \u00a333.8bn, which was \u00a34.9bn lower than at the same point last year. In order to meet the full-year target set out at the time of the March budget, borrowing would have to fall by \u00a321bn over the next seven months. In March, George Osborne was still in Number 11 and set an ambitious plan to swing the public finances back into a surplus of \u00a310.4bn by 2019-20, with unspecified spending cuts and tax rises. Economists, however, say that Osborne\u2019s successor, Philip Hammond, was likely to row back on some of the old targets, having already signalled he is ready to \u201creset\u201d the public finances to support the economy. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe improvement in the public finances in August is unlikely to continue as the post- referendum economic slowdown begins to bite and chancellor Hammond probably eases the fiscal squeeze in the autumn statement.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said Hammond was likely to announce measures to boost spending in areas such as housing and transport in order to offset a potential slowdown in private investment. \u201cWe would also expect him to push back by a couple of years the date by which he aims to eliminate the budget deficit,\u201d Hawksworth said. \u201cBut we would still expect him to pursue this objective in the longer term as economic conditions permit.\u201d In a separate assessment of the state of the UK economy following the referendum, the ONS said that while the post referendum picture was still emerging, there had been no sharp collapse in confidence as some had feared. It could take months, quarters and years for the full picture to emerge. Chief economist Joe Grice said: \u201cAs the available information grows, the referendum result appears, so far, not to have had a major effect on the UK economy. So it hasn\u2019t fallen at the first fence but longer-term effects remain to be seen.\u201d He added that the first estimate of gross domestic growth for the third quarter, to be published on 27 October, would provide a clearer picture. The August figures were boosted by a 7.1% increase in tax receipts, with a 12% rise in income tax payments. Martin Beck at the EY Item Club said the Office for Budget Responsibility was likely to cut its UK growth forecasts when it revises them at the time of the autumn statement in November. He said: \u201cThe OBR is likely to cut its growth forecast, which combined with a possible fiscal stimulus, could push up annual borrowing by the tens of billions of pounds.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Financial shares are rallying strongly after the Bank of Japan introduced further stimulus measures to boost its flagging economy. Barclays is the biggest riser in the leading index, up 5.5p at 171.95p. It has also been helped by analysts at HSBC moving their recommendation from hold to buy and raising their target price from 150p to 190p. They said that selling Barclays\u2019 unwanted assets would add value to the business. Elswhere Lloyds Banking Group has been lifted 0.96p to 57.4p while HSBC itself is 7.2p higher at 590.6p. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: European markets are following Asia higher - with banks and financial companies leading the charge after the Bank of Japan surprised the market. With the market divided on whether the Bank of Japan would increase stimulus or cut rates further, Governor Kuroda decided to think outside the box and scrapped their set monetary base goal with the intent of targeting yields of various maturities, thereby creating a steeper yield curve. The shape of the yield curve has, in the past, been a very clear predictor of future economic activity. A flat yield curve gives no incentive for banks to lend, and typically presages an imminent economic slowdown. A steeper yield curve provides the motivation for banks to encourage customers to borrow, and is typically associated with a strengthening economy. Given that financial companies borrow short and lend long, today\u2019s announcement by the Bank of Japan has provided the rocket fuel for Japanese banks to rally strongly. The major question is how effective this policy will be. But Royal Bank of Scotland is missing out, down 1.4p to 182.3p after Santander pulled out of talks to buy 315 branches the bank must spin off. Overall the FTSE 100 is now up 31.31 points at 6862.10, but the day is likely to be volatile ahead of this evening\u2019s US Federal Reserve meeting. The central bank is not expected to raise interest rates, but it cannot entirely be ruled out. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Markets are expecting a hike sometime in the next few months, just not today, which suggests that any move by the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee today would catch the markets completely unprepared. This would have the potential to be a rather risky option for the Fed, despite significant enthusiasm from several members of the committee to go now, which means if the Fed were to move today, Janet Yellen\u2019s press conference would then be an exercise in expectations management, though this would be equally true if they hold rate, as is widely expected, though it would be an easier task to manage. Housebuilders are higher, continuing to benefit from a note this week from UBS, which said the UK housing market had been more resilient than expected after the Brexit vote. Persimmon has put on 48p to \u00a318.14 while Barratt Developments is 9.8p better at 488.5p. Mining shares were also better on hopes of stability in the Chinese economy and a boost from the Japanese stimulus move. Anglo American has added 25.6p to 883.2p while Rio Tinto has risen 54.5p to 2414.5p. Elsewhere information provider RELX is the biggest loser in the FTSE 100, down 17p at \u00a314.51 as analysts at Macquarie issued an underperform rating. They said the company would find it difficult to improve operating performance further and it was time for a transformational deal. Among the mid-caps, online grocer Ocado is down 0.7p at 268.1p as Deutsche Bank cut from hold to sell.

It has also been helped by analysts at HSBC moving their recommendation from hold to buy and raising their target price from 150p to 190p. They said that selling Barclays\u2019 unwanted assets would add value to the business.</p> <p>Elswhere <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> has been lifted 0.96p to 57.4p while <strong>HSBC</strong> itself is 7.2p higher at 590.6p. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> European markets are following Asia higher - with banks and financial companies leading the charge after the Bank of Japan surprised the market. With the market divided on whether the Bank of Japan would increase stimulus or cut rates further, Governor Kuroda decided to think outside the box and scrapped their set monetary base goal with the intent of targeting yields of various maturities, thereby creating a steeper yield curve.</p> <p> The shape of the yield curve has, in the past, been a very clear predictor of future economic activity. A flat yield curve gives no incentive for banks to lend, and typically presages an imminent economic slowdown. A steeper yield curve provides the motivation for banks to encourage customers to borrow, and is typically associated with a strengthening economy. Given that financial companies borrow short and lend long, today\u2019s announcement by the Bank of Japan has provided the rocket fuel for Japanese banks to rally strongly. The major question is how effective this policy will be.</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> is missing out, down 1.4p to 182.3p after <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/20/rbs-suffers-fresh-setback-in-williams-glyn-spin-off-deal\">Santander pulled out of talks to buy 315 branches the bank must spin off. </a></strong></p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>is now up 31.31 points at 6862.10, but the day is likely to be volatile ahead of this evening\u2019s US Federal Reserve meeting. The central bank is not expected to raise interest rates, but it cannot entirely be ruled out. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets are expecting a hike sometime in the next few months, just not today, which suggests that any move by the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee today would catch the markets completely unprepared.</p> <p>This would have the potential to be a rather risky option for the Fed, despite significant enthusiasm from several members of the committee to go now, which means if the Fed were to move today, Janet Yellen\u2019s press conference would then be an exercise in expectations management, though this would be equally true if they hold rate, as is widely expected, though it would be an easier task to manage.</p> </blockquote> <p>Housebuilders are higher, continuing to benefit from a note this week from UBS, which said the UK housing market had been more resilient than expected after the Brexit vote. <strong>Persimmon</strong> has put on 48p to \u00a318.14 while <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> is 9.8p better at 488.5p.</p> <p>Mining shares were also better on hopes of stability in the Chinese economy and a boost from the Japanese stimulus move. <strong>Anglo American</strong> has added 25.6p to 883.2p while <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> has risen 54.5p to 2414.5p.</p> <p>Elsewhere information provider <strong>RELX</strong> is the biggest loser in the FTSE 100, down 17p at \u00a314.51 as analysts at Macquarie issued an underperform rating. They said the company would find it difficult to improve operating performance further and it was time for a transformational deal.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, online grocer <strong>Ocado</strong> is down 0.7p at 268.1p as Deutsche Bank cut from hold to sell. It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the share has fallen 17% post the third quarter, we continue to have 18% downside to our unchanged 220p target price.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has called on Malcolm Turnbull to ditch his $200m marriage equality plebiscite and use $50m to give Arrium Steel a one-off grant instead. Shorten said Arrium needed the grant to help it update its technology, making the whole of the steelmaker\u2019s business more attractive a sale as a going concern, rather than be sold off in pieces. Arrium was placed in administration in April after negotiations with its lenders broke down following sustained low commodity prices, and it has not yet found a buyer. Shorten said Labor wanted to protect Australia\u2019s steel manufacturing industry and it was far more important to keep Arrium in one piece than to waste money on an expensive plebiscite. He said that during the election campaign the Turnbull government had only pledged to lend Arrium $49.2m but it should boost that support with an extra $50m grant to keep steel manufacturing in Australia. \u201cFor a little bit of grant funding, this business has got a very bright future,\u201d Shorten said on Wednesday during a visit to South Australia. \u201cOur steelmakers are amongst the best in the world but what they need is a government who\u2019s willing to back them up. \u201cIt isn\u2019t good enough that while Mr Turnbull struts the world stage, while he talks about spending $200m on a wasteful plebiscite on marriage equality, he can\u2019t guarantee $50m to help save local jobs. \u201cFor Labor the equation is clear, you can either spend $200m on a wasteful marriage plebiscite, or you can spend $50m saving local jobs.\u201d In June, Turnbull dismissed a proposed bailout of Arrium\u2019s steelworks in Whyalla, South Australia, describing it as premature. During the election campaign, he pledged to lend Arrium\u2019s administrators $49.2m so they could buy new equipment for the company\u2019s iron ore operations. That loan has since been approved. On Wednesday, workers at the Whyalla steelworks said they would hold a vote next week to agree to a 10% pay cut to save the company about $17m a year, according to reports. A 10% pay cut would make the business more appealing to potential buyers. The South Australian senator Nick Xenophon said on Wednesday if Arrium\u2019s workers were willing to \u201cdo their bit\u201d to save the company then federal and state governments ought to support the company financially, too. He said the question of marriage equality should be dealt with by a vote in parliament, rather than spending millions of dollars on a plebiscite. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to ask any worker to take any form of pay cut, but clearly a lot of workers in Whyalla understand how difficult things are,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking sure that Arrium survives as a structural steelmaker in this country is a good investment in the future of Australian manufacturing. \u201cWe are facing a precipice in the next few months, when the car-making sector in this country effectively shuts down by the end of 2017. We can\u2019t afford to lose Arrium because that will basically be the beginning of the end of manufacturing in this country.\u201d The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has criticised Shorten for trying to link the same-sex marriage plebiscite to the problems at Arrium. \u201cIt\u2019s sadly a bit of cheap politics from Bill,\u201d Morrison told Sky News. \u201cThe government has been working very closely with the South Australian government across party lines on this. We\u2019re working closely with the administrators, Greg Hunt has been down there. \u201cWhat Bill\u2019s basically saying is throw some money at it and that money will just end up with the banks ... he rails against the banks every other day but he\u2019s actually putting forward a solution which he doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate would just effectively be a cash-through to the banks.\u201d Labor says the marriage equality plebiscite will cost $200m, because that refers to the total economic cost. The plebiscite will cost $170m to hold, including funding the yes and no campaigns, which the government will fund from consolidated revenue. But it will also incur an estimated regulatory burden of $32.5m, being the time taken for people to cast their vote, according to the explanatory memorandum to the plebiscite (same-sex marriage) bill. The total economic cost of the plebiscite is therefore estimated to be $202.5m. Arrium employs more than 7,000 workers, including about 3,500 in South Australia.",
