      "bodyText": "The federal government will intervene to let Toyota workers vote on proposed changes to its industrial relations policy, the employment minister, Eric Abetz, said. Toyota is appealing to the federal court after it lost a case last December seeking to allow employees a vote on adding various clauses to its enterprise agreement. Among the clauses are reducing the \"Christmas shutdown\" period from 21 days to 10 days, reducing the number of days of paid leave to attend union delegate training from 10 days a year to five days in the first year and two days in subsequent years, and removal of paid \"wash-up time\". Toyota claimed the clauses were necessary to compete with plants in other countries, but a group of Toyota workers argued in court it was in breach of the enterprise agreement. The government has offered support for the changes \u2013 with the treasurer, Joe Hockey, last week claiming the union was \u201cat war\u201d with Toyota \u2013 and it has now decided to join the federal court appeal. \"It is clearly in the public interest that the workers be allowed to vote on Toyota's proposed variations and determine their own destiny,\" Abetz told guests at the Sydney Institute on Tuesday. \"Tonight I announce that I have decided to intervene in support of Toyota's workers being allowed a say as soon as possible on the proposed variation.\" He said the clauses should not have been proposed for the agreement in the first place. Abetz said 1586 working days, or about $370,000 in wages, are lost by a clause that would allow a half day on the last day before shutdown. If all 69 of the company's union delegates took the full 10 days' paid leave for education activity, this resulted in 690 working days lost, or about $150,000 in wages, he said. \"These are just two instances of how more than 2000 working days\u2019 worth of productivity could be re-injected into Toyota immediately,\" he said. \"Management needs to accept responsibility. But it is deeply troubling that the employees' right to vote on proposed variations has been frustrated.\" The acting AMWU national secretary, Paul Bastian, told Guardian Australia it\u2019s \u201cnot surprising\u201d to hear this announcement by Abetz, and accused the government of shifting blame. \u201cIf we look back at the extraordinary events last week, the treasurer of this country and the industry minister trying to shift the blame for the demise of the auto industry on to the back of workers \u2026 it\u2019s not surprising that they would make this move,\u201d Bastian said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit back and cop the government trying to cop out.\u201d Bastian said Toyota was exercising its rights under legislation by appealing against December\u2019s decision, just as workers did, but the dispute won\u2019t be resolved in court. \u201cThe union took a position that we had rights under the agreement and we sought to enforce those rights.

He accused the Labor leader and former industrial relations minister Bill Shorten of granting \"an unseemly range of union wish-list claims\", while the former prime minister Julia Gillard played \"Santa Claus\" to union demands. \"Every union boss, like a child writing to Father Christmas, presented their wish list to the government, which was duly granted,\" he said.",

It is understood that Ahrendts, an American who has helped build the British raincoat maker into an international fashion brand, will receive her award for services to business from a minister at the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS). Fellow American Gates will receive her award for services to philanthropy and international development from an official at the Department for International Development (Dfid).

      "bodyText": "Paul Flowers, the disgraced former chairman of the Co-operative Bank, was appointed to the post because he did better than rival candidates in psychometric tests, the Treasury select committee of MPs was told on Tuesday. The methodist minister, now facing allegations of buying illegal drugs, was chairman from 2010 until last June just as the scale of the bank's \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall began to emerge. The former deputy chairman of the Co-op Bank, Rodney Baker-Bates, told MPs that he lost out to Flowers in becoming chairman and revealed that he eventually quit his boardroom role in protest over the attempt to take control of 631 Lloyds Banking Group branches, codenamed Verde. Asked by committee chairman Andrew Tyrie MP if the Co-op bank would have continued in its previous form if he had become chairman, Baker-Bates said: \"Yes. I think it would \u2026 That may be arrogant.\" After a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall was uncovered by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) arm of the Bank of England, the Co-op was bailed out by bondholders \u2013 led by US hedge funds \u2013 who now own 70% of the bank. The Co-op Group, the mutual which owns supermarkets and funeral homes, owns the remaining 30% of the bank, which is to be floated on the stock market. To laughter on the committee, Baker-Bates said he had been told Flowers had been picked as chairman because he had done well in psychometric tests. David Davies, another deputy chairman, said he had been told Flowers \u2013 a member of the Co-op Group board \u2013 had been chosen for his leadership skills and admitted he had been surprised by the results of the psychometric tests. The two former deputy co-chairmen \u2013 who both voted against the Verde deal \u2013 agreed that Flowers did not have the financial expertise to be chairman. Baker-Bates and Davies were, according to David Ruffley MP, appointed as deputy chairmen to \"mind\" Flowers. Baker-Bates had been the chairman of Britannia when it was merged with Co-op in 2009, the deal that is now blamed for the bad loan losses at the enlarged bank. Davies was on the Co-op board at the time of that deal, which took place at the height of the financial crisis. After hearing the testimony of the two men, Tyrie said it was apparent that the Co-op Group \u2013 chaired by Len Wardle who has since quit \u2013 rather than the bank had been driving the takeover of the Lloyds branches. \"The two deputy-chairmen of the Co-op bank, appointed to guide a chairman with little knowledge of finance, resigned because of their opposition to Verde. Instead of ignoring their advice, alarm bells should have sounded on the main Co-op Group board,\" Tyrie said. Baker-Batessaid he had quit the bank after concluding the attempt to buy the branches was a \"giant step too far\". That deal collapsed last year after months of negotiations and smashed hopes that the enlarged bank would be a major player on the high street. He was concerned whether the Co-op Group had enough \"capital and competence\" to compete in banking and supermarkets where it was growing quickly after taking over Somerfield. The two former deputy chairmen said Credit Suisse, acting for Lloyds, had approached the Co-op Group about a potential bid for the Verde branches in spring 2011. He said that the board was too large \u2013 22 people \u2013 and had members from the Co-operative movement without knowledge of banking. Peter Marks, who was boss of the Co-op Group, led the negotiations and Davies \u2013 who stayed on the board despite having voted against Verde \u2013 said he was \"convinced more and more directors saw the folly\" of the deal as time went on. They both expressed surprise about the deterioration in the Britannia deal. Baker-Bates said that a week before the 2012 financial year-end the PRA had written to the bank asking for a rethink of its provisions for bad debts. They were eventually increased by \u00a3300m from \u00a3185m. Davies said he became concerned about a \"worrying sub-plot\" where the management was being told that Verde was the \"least risk option \u2026 if we did not do the deal the bank could not survive\". Davies said he was convinced the PRA was adding additional capital requirements until the bank \"broke\".

Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And finally it is official. Highlighting just how rocky relations are with the organisations that have kept debt-stricken Greece afloat since May 2010, the finance minister Yannis Stournaras announced further disbursements of aid would have to wait until March. With creditors yet to complete their latest review of the economy \u2013 four months after it began \u2013 Stournaras felt fit to say at the end of the eurogroup meeting Monday that negotiations, it was now hoped, would be wrapped by the time eurozone finance ministers next met on February 17.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re aiming for an agreement before [then] while approval of the instalment will happen at the March euro group,\u201d said the economics professor insisting that the EU, ECB and IMF had \u201cyet to take into account\u201d Greece\u2019s unexpectedly good fiscal results in 2013. \u201cAnd that\u2019s so important, it overshadows everything.\u201d</p> <p>Reinforcing the argument that crisis-plagued Athens now had a stronger hand to play, a senior financial ministry official citing latest revenue and spending figures, leaked today that Greece\u2019s primary budget surplus was likely to exceed \u20ac1bn \u2013 well over the \u20ac 830m already seen as a major achievement, that Stournaras and others have publicly acknowledged so far.</p> <p>But there is no denying that the obstacles remain. Despite the country\u2019s tremendous fiscal consolidation \u2013 a record in the history of the EU \u2013 senior EU mandarins, from the euro group president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, to the monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn, and Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, are all at pains to emphasise that there is still \u201ca great deal to be done\u201d (even if Schauble has increasingly adopted a sweet tone when he speaks about matters Greek).</p> <p>And the fact is that concord is in short supply.</p> <p>The sustainability of Greece\u2019s debt load, which at 120% of GDP at the start of the crisis now stands at 176% and is unanimously accepted as the basis for any real economic revival, remains an open question, as do the fiscal shortfalls that will be faced by the eurozone\u2019s weakest member in 2014 and 2015. Under such circumstances it is easy to see why prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 shaky coalition government may, in fact, be trying to keep the troika at bay \u2013 at least until the euro elections in May.</p> </blockquote> <p><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9aa5b7e0-6fc7-48b0-86d8-5feea3ac1887\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/28/1390923515559/664fd25b-cfa6-44d8-a944-a9ff2df8c828-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A rally of metro workers outside the organization's headquarters in Athens, protesting against the civil mobilization order to block their strikes.

Today's data shows 0.7% growth in the three months to December -- so either there was a big drop in output in December (<i>unlikely</i>) or output per hour fell in Q4.</p> <p>Britain's falling productivity is one of the big economic mysteries of recent years -- why is it taking more and more hours to produce the same amount of output since the crisis began?</p> <p>Weldon reckons there are clues in the unemployment data. It shows a large rise in people employed in healthcare and human services (up over 4000,000 since the start of 2008) and real estate (+100k), but significant falls in construction (-200k) and manufacturing (-&gt;300k) over the same period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e7e0eda3-5e33-4787-8d6b-17272cf87674\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/28/1390917771284/51112947-5b57-4898-ae21-d9a405c76d71-460x407.png\" alt=\"UK job creation since 2008\" width=\"460\" height=\"407\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: ONS/Duncan Weldon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br></p> <p>The pattern, he concludes, is that Britain has created more lower-paid, lower-productivity jobs since the crisis began - which is very bad news in the long term for growth potential and living standards.</p> <p>He's just launched a longer blog post of his own about it.

But with the Turkish central bank set to consider a possible interest rate rise later tonight - even though the prime minister is opposed to any hike - and the US Federal Reserve meeting to decide whether to continue trimming its $75bn a month bond buying programme, the volatility of the past few days is unlikely to end just yet. The final scores on the doors were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 21.67 points or 0.33% higher at 6572.33 \u2022 Germany's Dax rose 0.62% to 9406.91 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.98% higher at 4185.29 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.91% better at 19,448.32 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 1.24% to 9879.1 Over on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.4% or 63 points higher. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back again tomorrow. Back with the UK economy, and it is clear not everyone is impressed with the progress being claimed by the government. Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales said: It's clear that this government has failed to reform our fraud-ridden, shaky financial sector, and has not, as it promised in 2010, made any progress on rebalancing our economy. \ufeffChancellor George Osborne has made it even harder for small businesses to compete against multinationals by cutting the corporate tax rate, and presided over a collapse in business investment, particularly in the hugely promising 'green sector', which has suffered hugely from the government's inept vacillating on energy policy. Over to Greece where it has been officially confirmed that fresh bailout funds will not be disbursed until March (at the earliest). Helena Smith reports from Athens: And finally it is official. Highlighting just how rocky relations are with the organisations that have kept debt-stricken Greece afloat since May 2010, the finance minister Yannis Stournaras announced further disbursements of aid would have to wait until March. With creditors yet to complete their latest review of the economy \u2013 four months after it began \u2013 Stournaras felt fit to say at the end of the eurogroup meeting Monday that negotiations, it was now hoped, would be wrapped by the time eurozone finance ministers next met on February 17. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming for an agreement before [then] while approval of the instalment will happen at the March euro group,\u201d said the economics professor insisting that the EU, ECB and IMF had \u201cyet to take into account\u201d Greece\u2019s unexpectedly good fiscal results in 2013. \u201cAnd that\u2019s so important, it overshadows everything.\u201d Reinforcing the argument that crisis-plagued Athens now had a stronger hand to play, a senior financial ministry official citing latest revenue and spending figures, leaked today that Greece\u2019s primary budget surplus was likely to exceed \u20ac1bn \u2013 well over the \u20ac 830m already seen as a major achievement, that Stournaras and others have publicly acknowledged so far. But there is no denying that the obstacles remain. Despite the country\u2019s tremendous fiscal consolidation \u2013 a record in the history of the EU \u2013 senior EU mandarins, from the euro group president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, to the monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn, and Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, are all at pains to emphasise that there is still \u201ca great deal to be done\u201d (even if Schauble has increasingly adopted a sweet tone when he speaks about matters Greek). And the fact is that concord is in short supply. The sustainability of Greece\u2019s debt load, which at 120% of GDP at the start of the crisis now stands at 176% and is unanimously accepted as the basis for any real economic revival, remains an open question, as do the fiscal shortfalls that will be faced by the eurozone\u2019s weakest member in 2014 and 2015. Under such circumstances it is easy to see why prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 shaky coalition government may, in fact, be trying to keep the troika at bay \u2013 at least until the euro elections in May. One business which is not moving higher is Apple. The iPad and iPhone maker's shares have slumped more than 8% to $504 after it reported a disappointing outlook for second quarter sales. And despite the company selling a record 51m iPhones in three months to the end of December, this fell short of the 55m expected by analysts. More than a dozen brokers cut their price targets for Apple, amid concerns the market had become saturated and it would need a cheaper iPhone to see off low-cost rivals. Its next set of products will need to be innovative for it to regain its cutting edge reputation. More data from the US and it's a little mixed. The Richmond Federal Reserve's manufacturing index for January came in at 12 compared to expectations of a level of 13. But the January consumer confidence index hit 80.7, much better than the forecast 78.1. December's figure however was revised down from 78.1 to 77.5. Following the weak durable goods numbers this will give the Federal Reserve something to think about at its two day meeting starting today - the last one Ben Bernanke will chair. The Fed's decision on its QE programme will be announced tomorrow evening, and some believe it could trim its bond buying programme again following the $10bn cut to $75bn last month. Mads Koefoed, head of macro strategy at Saxo Bank said: The US economy acceleration out of 2013, and despite a weak December employment report, I expect [the Fed] to sway in favour of more tapering at its January meeting. Specifically, another $10bn in QE3 tapering will be announced and divided equally between mortgage-backed securities and treasuries. Meanwhile Wall Street has recovered after its recent falls, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently up around 86 points or 0.5% in early trading. Time for a very brief catch-up. Britain's economy has posted its fastest annual growth since before the Great Recession, expanding by 1.9% during 2013. The Office for National Statistics reported at 9.30am that GDP rose by 0.7% in the final three months of 2013. Chief economist Joe Grice said that, after a long haul, there are signs that the recovery is more broad-based. We have now seen four successive quarters of significant growth and the economy does seem to be improving more consistently. The growth was, predictably, welcomed by Conservative ministers as a sign that the government's economic plan is working. George Osborne said: \"These numbers are a boost for the economic security of hardworking people. Growth is broadly based, with manufacturing growing fastest of all. It is more evidence that our long term economic plan is working. But the job is not done, and it is clear that the biggest risk now to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that's delivering jobs and a brighter economic future.\" But shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Britain's cost-of-living crisis wasn't resolved, and backed business secretary Vince Cable's warning last night that the shape of the recovery was wrong. Deputy PM, the Liberal Democrat's Nick Clegg, welcomed the GDP news but also cautioned that deficit-reduction plans need to \"fairly\" share the burden. \u2022 City economists broadly welcomed the data -- Berenberg Bank's Rob Wood reckons we could see growth rise to 3% this year. \u2022 Britain's Services sector grew by 0.8% in the last quarter. Industrial production was up 0.7% (with manufacturing output jumping by 0.9%), but construction output fell by 0.3%. Some economists warned that this shows Britain has failed to rebalance its economy since the financial crisis began. The best-performing part of the services sector was the \"Business services and finance\" section. \u2022 The IPPR said that the recovery could stumble unless firms use their cash piles on business investment. Productivity remains a concern, too, with Duncan Weldon of the TUC flagging up that the number of extra hours worked is rising faster than GDP. \u2022 An opinion poll from ITV News and ComRes found that many people fear inequality is rising. It also found that just 22% of people believe George Osborne should get the credit for the recovery. And with that, Nick Fletcher is taking over for the rest of the day. Cheers all. GW Three quarters of Britons believe that the gap in wealth between rich and poor is widening in the UK, and barely a fifth reckon George Osborne should get the credit for the recovery. Just two findings from an opinion poll published by ITV News and ComRes this lunchtime, which showed that many people say they haven't felt the benefits of the upturn.. It found that a majority saw inequality rising as the UK recovery picks up pace -- with 61% agreeing that \"economic growth has only really benefitted wealthy individuals\" so far. 2,052 British adults were interviewed, online, between Friday 24th and Sunday 26th January 2014. While 40% said the economy had got better over the last three months, 34% reported no change and 25% said it had got worse. Here's another highlight: There is a degree of optimism moving forward, with three in ten (31%) British adults agreeing that they are confident that if the UK economy grows they will be personally better off, despite 38% disagreeing. However, only one in ten (11%) agree that they have benefitted from the growth in the UK economy over the past six months and seven in ten (71%) disagree. There are more details over on ITV News's website. Back to UK GDP, and I just chatted with TUC senior economist Duncan Weldon about growth and productivity. He explained that while the 0.7% growth in Q4 2013 is clearly welcome, the balance of the UK economy still doesn't look great. Indeed, it appears to have become less balanced since the financial crisis - with the Service sector now above its pre-crisis peak but the Manufacturing and Construction sectors around 10% smaller. Unless those parts of the economy grow faster than services, you're not going to get a better balance. But his main concern is about productivity -- recent labour market stats show that the total hours worked rose by 1.1% in the three months to November. Today's data shows 0.7% growth in the three months to December -- so either there was a big drop in output in December (unlikely) or output per hour fell in Q4. Britain's falling productivity is one of the big economic mysteries of recent years -- why is it taking more and more hours to produce the same amount of output since the crisis began? Weldon reckons there are clues in the unemployment data. It shows a large rise in people employed in healthcare and human services (up over 4000,000 since the start of 2008) and real estate (+100k), but significant falls in construction (-200k) and manufacturing (-&gt;300k) over the same period. The pattern, he concludes, is that Britain has created more lower-paid, lower-productivity jobs since the crisis began - which is very bad news in the long term for growth potential and living standards. He's just launched a longer blog post of his own about it. Worth a read: The Changing Shape of the British Economy in Recession &amp; Recovery Switching to the US briefly, a slab of bad American economic news just hit the wires. Orders for durable goods slumped by 4.3% in December -- the biggest monthly fall since last July. Economists had expected that orders grew by 1.8% . December was a grim month weather-wise in the US (ice storms gripped the country, and has already been blamed for recent poor employment data). So perhaps it's all the snow's fault... Our economics correspondent Phillip Inman writes that George Osborne cannot, and shouldn't, crow too loudly about the UK growth: Vince Cable and his supporters are well aware there are key components of the recovery that are still Awol. Business investment kept falling last year when it was supposed to take over from consumer spending as one of the main drivers of growth. Export growth has stuttered to a halt, leaving us with a persistent balance of payments problem before the country really starts to spend and suck in huge amounts of imports. Then there is the London factor. Along with the south-east, the capital is bounding along while many regions are still propped up by the public sector. But concerns about the nature and sustainability of the recovery are only one restraint on triumphalism. The other is the need to continue selling austerity as a key election message. How can the government cheer while it tries to convince a weary electorate they must vote for more cuts? Why George Osborne won't be cheering too loudly about the latest GDP figures Over on the Telegraph, Jeremy Warner recognises that the service sector growth, while welcome, shows how the recovery is still unbalanced: In the end, the only route to sustainable, balanced growth is via gains in productivity and incomes, and regrettably, we are not yet there. The economy has been juiced to give Coalition parties a boost ahead of the election, but with the deficit not yet tackled, glaring gaps in industrial competitiveness, severe supply side constraints, and a runaway housing market, we are still a million miles away from economic salvation. Britain's economic recovery: unbalanced and unsustainable Looking through the reaction to the UK GDP, Ian Brinkley, chief economist at The Work Foundation, makes an important point -- that Britain still has a productivity problem. \u201cThe latest preliminary GDP figures confirm a firmly based, if not spectacular, recovery is underway. However, with employment growing faster than GDP the productivity figures for the final quarter of 2013 are likely to be very poor. Preliminary GDP figures in recoveries are often revised upwards, so the underlying position may be a bit better than we think. Either way, however, we have a jobs rich and productivity poor recovery and that may not be sustainable over the medium term.\u201d Just spotted Andrew Sparrow is covering the key points at Treasury Questions, here. Sticking with parliament, Ed Balls (amid much noise from the Conservative benches) is trying to ask about the economy. Speaker Bercow shushes them, 'punning' about how in tennis you get new balls after seven games (?) Balls asks why Osborne won't admit that living standards aren't going up. Osborne replies that Balls had claimed that a recovery couldn't happen under the government's plan, that the deficit would go up, that we'd never get growth without extra government spending. On the other side of the house they need new crystal balls, Osborne concludes. Very good, Chancellor, a joke about my name, responds the shadow chancellor. They then clash about fiscal policy -- Balls asks Osborne to rule out cutting the top rate of tax. The chancellor replies by attacking Balls' plan to raise the rate to 50p, saying it's anti-business and has been refuted by the IFS already. Over in Parliament, MPs are holding Treasury questions -- they're discussing important issues like infrastructure spending (Danny Alexander is denying that the government is moving too slowly). One opposition MP, Sammy Wilson, DUP member for East Antrim, just welcomed the news that the economy was growing, but asked what is happening to stimulate growth beyond London. David Gauke, exchequer secretary, replies that employment has gone up in every region of the UK since the election. The quarterly GDP data has become increasingly charged with political implications as the next election draws nearer (scheduled for May 2015). Faisal Islam of Channel 4 comments: Britain's businesses need to stop sitting on their cash piles and crank up their investment, argues IPPR\u2019s chief economist Tony Dolphin: \u201cThe news that manufacturing is growing is welcome. But businesses have been sitting on a lot of cash, and the economy is still smaller than before the crisis. We need more business investment and a pick up in exports before we can truly see this economic growth as sustainable. \u201cMuch of the recovery is based in London in the finance and business sectors but we need to see growth across the whole country. We need more sectors like the car industry taking up the baton of recovery, investing in plant and machinery to drive an increase in productivity. The jobs market held up better than expected but unless we see investment by companies in their capabilities we won\u2019t see the growth in living standards that we want. Dolphin is also concerned that few lessons have been learned since the crisis ripped through the financial markets and the global economy: \u201cStrong growth in the short-term does not mean that structural weaknesses in the UK economy that became more evident during the \u2018Great Recession\u2019 have been eliminated. Unless we move to adopt a new economic model, the recovery will prove unsustainable and bittersweet for those who do not benefit from it before it is extinguished.\u201d And here's TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady's take: \ufeff\"Any return to growth is welcome, but this is the wrong kind of recovery and is two years late. \"The recovery is yet to reach whole swathes of the country or feed into people's pay packets. This must change if the benefits of recovery are to be felt by both businesses and workers. Unless the short-term boost provided by house prices and consumer debt is transformed into investment, rebalancing and higher living standards, the danger is that it will prove unsustainable.\" Interesting comments from deputy prime minister Nick Clegg -- he's said that the task of repairing the country's finances must be completed \"fairly\". I've taken the comments from PA: \ufeff\"Our economy is moving in the right direction - unemployment is down and growth is up. \"The coalition Government has set Britain on the right course by repairing the country's finances and helping to create over 1.6 million jobs in the private sector. \"But we must finish the job fairly, with further investment in jobs outside London and by cutting taxes for working people.\" The reference to fairness comes a day after the Liberal Democrats appeared to break away from the post-2015 deficit reduction plan laid out by George Osborne. Business secretary Vince Cable said further welfare cuts to save an additional \u00a330bn in the next parliament were a political and ideological commitment. The strongest performing part of Britain's services sector was \"Business services and finance\", which posted 1.2% growth in the last quarter. That covers banks, insurers, technology companies, other financial firms, estate agents, and goods rental companies. Sky's Ed Conway just had an entertaining exchange of views with the Treasury after he argued that this showed the UK was NOT rebalancing: Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, reckons growth rates will slip back during 2014 because of the financial pressure on households: The challenge now is to broaden out the recovery beyond the consumer and housing market. The enduring squeeze on real wages will limit the consumers\u2019 ability to continue to drive the recovery forwards. Investment and exports are likely to have improved in Q4, but not enough to drive growth forward at the pace we\u2019ve become accustomed to. So the chances are that the pace of growth will slow a little through 2014. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank isn't worried by the 0.3% drop in construction output in the last quarter, and With all construction surveys red hot right now, construction should bounce back quickly and economy wide growth should accelerate further. There are absolutely no signs of growth slowing anytime soon. If anything, the risks are towards an acceleration. He predicts strong growth both this year and next year, as the Bank of England's exceptionally loose monetary policy reaps dividends: The 2013 data show that low interest rates and a massive housing stimulus can be a very powerful tailwind indeed, offsetting headwinds to growth from factors like deleveraging. With every chance that some of the headwinds will fade this year, the monetary policy tailwind should drive UK growth higher over the next two years. The recovery will snowball. We expect the economy to expand by 3.0% in 2014 and then 3.3% in 2015. Stronger growth will put more pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates -- although governor Mark Carney spent a lot of his time at Davos last week insisting that the UK economy isn't strong enough yet. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls says he's happy that the economy is \"finally\" growing. But, speaking on BBC News 24, he warned many people are suffering from a cost-of-living crisis with real wages still falling. There is more to do to get a balanced strong economy, Balls says. That's exactly what George Osborne says, replies the BBC's Simon McCoy. You're in agreement with him? No, Balls replies, He says he's frustrated that George Osborne spent three years getting things wrong, and \"choked off\" the recovery. He argues business don't trust the chancellor, if they did they'd be investing more. McCoy asks about Vince Cable's comments last night about the shape of the UK economy. Balls replies that Cable is right, and he's reflecting the same concerns I'm expressing. Have you spoke to each other about this? No, he's a grown-up politician who looks at these figures and sees a big difference between the government's complacency and the reality, the shadow chancellor replies. Balls adds that the risks in the global economy mean Britain needs a stronger recovery. \ufeffThese are fragile times, and he's [Cable] saying, as I'm saying, that this is not the strong sustained economy that we need. Here's our full news story about today's GDP data: UK economy grew 1.9% in 2013 \u2013 the fastest growth since 2007 The British economy grew at the strongest rate in six years in 2013, having ended the year on a strong note as the recovery became more entrenched. The UK's services and manufacturing sectors were the drivers of 0.7% growth in the fourth quarter, taking the annual growth rate to 1.9%, the strongest since 2007 before the financial crisis took hold. The economy grew in every quarter last year according to the Office for National Statistics, providing a significant boost for the chancellor who has persistently argued that a burgeoning recovery is proof that his economic plan is working. The CBI are also upbeat about prospects this year. CBI director-general John Cridland says: The economy is growing and the recovery gathering momentum. This is good news, and we\u2019re seeing improvement across many different sectors. While I chew through the GDP data, our senior political correspondent Andrew Sparrow is liveblogging from parliament where top executives from Atos and G4S are being questioned by MPs over public sector reform. Atos and G4S questioned by MPs: Politics live blog Jeremy Cook, chief economist of World First, the currency exchange firm, reckons the UK ended the year in 'fine fettle', even though the service sector provided much of the growth, again.... \u201cThe 0.3% fall in construction output will be a concern, but I would hope that an increased level of investment throughout 2014 should reverse this.\" The government needs to do more to sustain the recovery, warns John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce. Longworth said the rise in GDP confirms anecdotal evidence that UK firms are \"ever more bullish\", but rising confidence isn't enough: \ufeff \u201cIt is of course heartening that Britain is now amongst the fastest-growing advanced economies. But more must be done to shore up the foundations of this recovery if it is to be a lasting one. Unless we do much better on the three 'T's - training, transport infrastructure and trade support - our aspirations for investment at home and success around the globe cannot be achieved. This chart shows how Britain has, finally, posted four quarters of growth in a calendar year for the first time since 2007: And this chart shows how Britain's dominant services sector (in green) bounced back much more strongly from the crisis than industrial production (black), construction (yellow) or agriculture (blue): You can see the ONS data online here. Reaction is flooding in: ING's James Knightley reckons that the UK could grow by up to 3% in 2014: With business surveys, such as the purchasing managers\u2019 indices and the British Chambers of Commerce reports indicating very strong activity across the economy it looks as though there is significant momentum at the beginning of 2014. Employment continues to rise robustly, housing activity is very firm, confidence is on the rise, credit growth is improving and the UK\u2019s key export market \u2013 the Eurozone \u2013 is showing some encouraging signs. Here's ONS chief economist Joe Grice's official comment on today's growth data: \ufeff\"We have now seen four successive quarters of significant growth and the economy does seem to be improving more consistently. \"Today's estimate suggests over four fifths of the fall in GDP during the recession has been recovered, although it still remains 1.3 per cent below the pre-recession peak.\" The manufacturing part of the UK economy grew by 0.9% in the last quarter, slightly faster than the wider industrial sector, which grew by 0.7%. George Osborne has seized on that as a stick to smite critics (such as Vince Cable?) who claim that he's failing to rebalance the economy and should change his plans: Don't forget that construction output fell by 0.3% during the quarter - unlike in Q3 when all sections of the economy expanded. David Cameron tweets that today's growth figures shows that the government's plans are working: Today's data also means that the UK has grown for all four quarters in a calendar year -- that's not happened since 2008 (although the double dip was revised away, there have been occasional quarters of negative or flat growth) Joe Grice repeated that that there is now a \"rather better tone\" to the UK economy, after four quarters of growth. Grice declined to say when UK workers might finally see wages rising in real terms, but did point out that inflation has recently fallen. Joe Grice explains that the 0.3% drop in construction output may be down to seasonal factors (worth remembering, though that the building sector had seen growing strongly early in the year). Asked about the wider state of the UK economy, Grice says that \"in the last year we have had more balanced growth than previously, but over the longer period we have had a divergence in the recovery.\" That's shown by the fact that that the Service sector is now bigger than before the financial markets were convulsed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but construction and manufacturing are someway shy. The recovery has been somewhat erratic, says Joe Grice, but it \"feels like the economy now has a better tone\". However the UK economy is still 1.3% smaller than before the financial crisis began. The UK service sector grew by 0.8% in the fourth quarter, and Industrial output racked up 0.7% growth. But Construction output fell by 0.3% in the October-December period. That means the services sector is higher than in 2008. But both industrial production and construction are around 11% smaller than before the crisis, Grice adds On an annual basis, GDP for 2013 was 1.9% higher than in 2012, says the ONS's Joe Grice. That, I believe, means Britain has recorded its strongest growth for any year since 2007. BREAKING: The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the final three months of 2013, the ONS just announced. Just a few minutes until the Office for National Statistics reveals the preliminary estimate of UK GDP for the final three months of 2013. ONS chief economist Joe Grice will announce the data at 9.30am sharp, and then take questions from the press. It should be broadcast live on the BBC and Sky News in the UK. Fact for the morning, via Sky News's Ed Conway - Poland is the fastest-growing member of the EU since the financial crisis began in 2008: And here's another graph reinforcing how the UK's economy has lagged behind major rivals since the great recession - with particularly weak growth from mid-2010 to mid-2012: Here's a couple of analyst predictions about today's GDP data (due in under 30 minutes): Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Our best bet is that GDP growth edged back to a still very decent 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2013 after accelerating to 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters from 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter. This would still result in year-on-year GDP growth accelerating to 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2013 from 1.9% in the third quarter, thereby giving the best annual growth rate since the first quarter of 2008. It would also result in overall GDP growth in 2013 coming in at 1.9%, which would be the best performance since 2007 and up from growth of just 0.3% in 2012. Even so, GDP in the fourth quarter of 2013 would still be 1.3% below the peak level seen in the first quarter of 2008. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale [SG]: The market looks for a 0.7% gain, SG for a 0.8% increase that takes the annual growth rate up to 2.9%, the fastest since Q4 2007. Sterling is a little stronger again today. Positive economic surprises have supported the currency and triggered a sharp re-pricing of the interest rate outlook, despite Mr Carney's best efforts to keep that in check. The pound has risen slightly this morning, touching $1.66 against the US dollar. James Ramsbottom, chief executive of the North East Chamber of Commerce, just put his finger on the underlying issue with the British recovery - it doesn't feel like a recovery for most of us, yet anyway. Speaking on the BBC's Today Programme, Ramsbottom said that manufacturing had \"sustained\" his region's economy (Nissan have a big plant in Sunderland) while construction has only recently picked up. \"But for many people on the street, it doesn't feel like it's changed,\" Ramsbottom added. Rob Marshall, who runs a web design firm, also cautioned that he didn't feel any better about business conditions than a year ago. But he has hired more staff since founding his firm in 2009, growing from four staff to 13. Duncan Weldon, the TUC's senior economist, makes four important points about today's data (in this blog): It\u2019s provisional data, it won't tell us much about living standards, UK productivity may still be falling, and Britain has lost a lot of ground against most comparable countries since the crisis began: Another point to watch will be which sectors of the UK economy did best - services, construction or manufacturing. Weldon says: Whilst the top line figure will tell us something about the overall pace of the recovery, the sector breakdown will tell us about its balance. Back to UK GDP. It's worth remembering that, despite the decent growth seen so far this year, Britain's economy has still not reached its pre-crisis peak. Three months ago it was still 2.5% smaller than its peak in 2008. The ONS reported last month that the UK grew by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2013, then 0.8% in the second and third quarters. An important development in emerging economies this morning -- India surprised the markets by announcing a surprise rise in interest rates, from 7.75% to 8%. The move is designed to underpin the rupee, and also to target India's inflation rate. Central Bank chief Raghuram Rajam said he might be able to cut rates again in future once inflation has been pegged back. The unexpected move comes hours before the central bank of Turkey (also under pressure in the recent emerging market turmoil) meets to discuss monetary policy. Many analysts expect a rate hike, or other measures, to prevent the Turkish lira being further routed. A reminder that while Britain's recovery continues, there's the potential for upheaval elsewhere.... The CBI has fuelled confidence in Britain's economy by declaring this morning that business output in the private sector is rising at the fastest pace since the collapse of Northern Rock. Ahead of this morning's GDP data, the employers body said the economic outlook looked bright. The proportion of firms reporting higher output over the last quarter has hit its highest level since Autumn 2007. Katja Hall, the CBI's chief policy director, said: A picture is unfolding of a real upsurge in output across much of the UK economy. Many firms in many sectors are feeling brighter about their prospects than they have for a long time, showing the recovery is gaining traction. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Britain's economic recovery is centre-stage today, with new data likely to show that the UK has recorded its strongest year since being rocked by the financial crisis six years ago. Preliminary GDP data for the final three months of 2013 will be unveiled with a flourish by the Office for National Statistics at 9.30am GMT. Economists expect another decent quarterly growth, with the economy growing by around 0.7%-0.8% (estimates vary, as usual). That would mean annual growth of around 1.9% -- which would be the best performance since 2007. Caveats abound, of course. Many experts fear that Britain has failed to rebalance its economy over recent years, with the current recovery based on the rickety framework of consumer spending and the housing recovery. A very British recovery, in other words. The business secretary Vince Cable even threw his weight behind this argument last night, warning that the \"shape\" of the recovery was less than ideal. Cable said: A real recovery is taking place The big question now is whether and how recent growth and optimism can be translated into long-term sustainable, balanced recovery without repeating the mistakes of the past. We cannot risk another property-linked boom-bust cycle which has done so much damage before, notably in the financial crash in 2008. Cable also appeared to be moving the Liberal Democrats away from George Osborne's plan of further cuts beyond the election to eliminate the deficit -- more here: Vince Cable undermines chancellor with 'wrong sort of recovery' message But there are signs that the chancellor's March of the Makers hasn't come to an abrupt halt, such as rising orders in the manufacturing sector. Britain is among the first countries to report GDP data for the last quarter, so today's preliminary reading could give some clues to how the global economy fared at the end of 2014. I'll be tracking the UK GDP data, and economic reaction to it, along with other news through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is axing half of the relationship managers handling queries from small businesses as part of more than 1,300 redundancies announced on Tuesday. The latest job cuts by the bailed-out bank \u2013 33% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 come amid mounting expectations that Barclays is also preparing to cut hundreds of highly-paid roles in its investment bank. Under new boss Antony Jenkins, Barclays is thought likely to remove managing directors from the investment bank, already the target of more than 1,600 reductions a year ago, when it publishes its results next month. The potential for new cuts at Barclays came after it emerged Jenkins had demanded a clamp down on company travel to save costs. The latest cuts at Lloyds are part of 15,000 redundancies announced by boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio when he took the top job three years ago. Some 11,760 of those roles have now gone \u2013 on top of an estimated 30,000 roles lost when Lloyds rescued HBOS during the financial crisis in 2008. Of the latest round of job cuts, about 560 are relationship managers working in the commercial banking arm and working with small businesses, which is half of the team in an area that is being closely watched by politicians concerned about the lack of lending to small businesses. Another 220 roles are being removed by the wealth management division with the rest spread across the rest of the bank, which is also outsourcing a further 310 roles involved in postal services. The job cuts angered trade unions at a time when the bank is aiming to start paying dividends to shareholders for the first time since the banking crisis with a view to allowing the government to sell off the rest of its stake. The first tranche of shares were sold in September. Ged Nichols of the Accord union said: \"Employees in the Lloyds Banking Group are not sharing fairly in this rising prosperity. The salaries of loyal and hardworking bank staff haven't kept pace with inflation in recent years, the bank has proposed cutbacks on pensions, variable pay has been reduced for many, yet the jobs haemorrhage continues. \"It's about time that the bank matched its treatment of staff to its aspiration to be Britain's most trusted bank. The trust that the workforce has in management is being seriously undermined and it's time to restore the balance.\" Officials at the Unite union noted that Horta-Os\u00f3rio had been handed shares worth \u00a32.3m as a result of the rise in the share price last year. \"Unite will continue to oppose these job losses and has sought an urgent meeting with Lloyds to outline the union's concerns. Unite remains adamant that as the bank continues to align its recovery to the UK's economic recovery, it is totally unacceptable that it persists in putting pressure on the public purse by making hundreds of jobs redundant on a bi-monthly basis,\" said Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer. Lloyds said it would handle the job cuts sensitively and said a third of the 11,760 roles hit by the bank's cost-cutting programme had required compulsory redundancy. \"We are committed to offering the best possible service to our SME clients,\" the bank said. \"All of our clients will continue to have the support of specialist business managers and for our smallest clients, in addition to branch staff, managers based in our central teams,\" the bank said, adding it was investing in IT.",

      "standfirst": "Reaction to the Office for National Statistics figures showing annual growth was 1.9%", 
      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/28/uk-economy-2013-fastest-growth-fourth-quarter-gdp\" title=\"\">Britain's economy grew at the strongest rate in six years in 2013</a>, as recovery from the longest financial crisis in a century became more established. Annual growth was 1.9%, after the economy ended the year on a positive note with a 0.7% quarterly increase in gross domestic product between October and December. Here is some of the reaction to the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/gva/gross-domestic-product--preliminary-estimate/q4-2013/index.html\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics figures</a>:</p> <h2>The prime minister, David Cameron, said on Twitter it was the latest positive sign for British people:</h2> <p>\"The #GDP figures are another sign our #LongTermEconomicPlan is working - more growth means more jobs, security and opportunities for people.\"</p> <h2>The chancellor, George Osborne, also took to Twitter to welcome the figures:</h2> <p>0.7% growth in GDP is a boost for the economic security of #hardworking people. Our long term plan is delivering a brighter economic future.</p> <p>Growth is broadly based with manufacturing growing fastest. The job is not done &amp; the biggest risk to recovery would be abandoning the plan.</p> <h2>Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, put the numbers in perspective, pointing out that the economy is still smaller than it was before the crisis:</h2> <p>We have now seen four successive quarters of significant growth and the economy does seem to be improving more consistently. Today's estimate suggests over four-fifths of the fall in GDP during the recession has been recovered, although it still remains 1.3% below the pre-recession peak.</p> <h2>Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trade Union Congress, said that while growth was welcome, the UK was having the \"wrong kind\" of recovery:</h2> <p>Any return to growth is welcome, but this is the wrong kind of recovery and is two years late. The recovery is yet to reach whole swaths of the country or feed into people's pay packets. This must change if the benefits of recovery are to be felt by both businesses and workers.</p> <p>Unless the short-term boost provided by house prices and consumer debt is transformed into investment, rebalancing and higher living standards, the danger is that it will prove unsustainable.</p> <h2>John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, agreed that there was work ahead to make this a sustainable recovery:</h2> <p>It is of course heartening that Britain is now amongst the fastest-growing advanced economies. But more must be done to shore up the foundations of this recovery if it is to be a lasting one. Unless we do much better on the three 'T's - training, transport infrastructure and trade support - our aspirations for investment at home and success around the globe cannot be achieved.</p> <p>We mustn't pat ourselves on the back for a recovery that is merely good, when what we need is a recovery that is truly great.</p> <h2>Alan Clarke, fixed income strategist at Scotiabank, said fourth-quarter growth was good but not great:</h2> <p>While that is a good outcome, it's not great - the survey based indicators suggest that we should have seen north of 1% quarter on quarter and labour data flying. Sadly disappointments in the construction data (which looks likely to be genuine due to a shortage of bricks) and only a pedestrian pace of services output held back Q4.</p> <p>The consensus outlook for 2014 as a whole is for 2.5% year-on-year growth. That implies that the quarter-on-quarter growth rate continues to soften slightly to just below 0.4% quarter-on-quarter by the end of the year.</p> <h2>John Cridland, director-general of business group the CBI, said the outlook for 2014 was strong:</h2> <p>The economy is growing and the recovery gathering momentum. This is good news, and we're seeing improvement across many different sectors. This is a strong platform for an even better year in 2014, and we expect the economy to continue to strengthen.</p> <h2>Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, agreed that quarterly growth of 0.7% was disappointing compared with stronger business surveys in recent weeks:</h2> <p>The 0.7% rise in UK GDP in Q4 is a touch disappointing given the recent strength of the business surveys. But it still takes full-year growth in 2013 to 1.9%, the best performance since 2007 and possibly the strongest growth in the G7.</p> <p>Of course, output remains below its pre-crisis peak (by 1.3%). And, in levels terms, the UK's economy's performance remains pretty insipid compared with other major economies.

      "bodyText": "Britain's economy grew at the strongest rate in six years in 2013, as recovery from the longest financial crisis in a century became more established. Annual growth was 1.9%, after the economy ended the year on a positive note with a 0.7% quarterly increase in gross domestic product between October and December. Here is some of the reaction to the Office for National Statistics figures: The prime minister, David Cameron, said on Twitter it was the latest positive sign for British people: \"The #GDP figures are another sign our #LongTermEconomicPlan is working - more growth means more jobs, security and opportunities for people.\" The chancellor, George Osborne, also took to Twitter to welcome the figures: 0.7% growth in GDP is a boost for the economic security of #hardworking people. Our long term plan is delivering a brighter economic future. Growth is broadly based with manufacturing growing fastest. The job is not done &amp; the biggest risk to recovery would be abandoning the plan. Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, put the numbers in perspective, pointing out that the economy is still smaller than it was before the crisis: We have now seen four successive quarters of significant growth and the economy does seem to be improving more consistently. Today's estimate suggests over four-fifths of the fall in GDP during the recession has been recovered, although it still remains 1.3% below the pre-recession peak. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trade Union Congress, said that while growth was welcome, the UK was having the \"wrong kind\" of recovery: Any return to growth is welcome, but this is the wrong kind of recovery and is two years late. The recovery is yet to reach whole swaths of the country or feed into people's pay packets. This must change if the benefits of recovery are to be felt by both businesses and workers. Unless the short-term boost provided by house prices and consumer debt is transformed into investment, rebalancing and higher living standards, the danger is that it will prove unsustainable. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, agreed that there was work ahead to make this a sustainable recovery: It is of course heartening that Britain is now amongst the fastest-growing advanced economies. But more must be done to shore up the foundations of this recovery if it is to be a lasting one. Unless we do much better on the three 'T's - training, transport infrastructure and trade support - our aspirations for investment at home and success around the globe cannot be achieved. We mustn't pat ourselves on the back for a recovery that is merely good, when what we need is a recovery that is truly great. Alan Clarke, fixed income strategist at Scotiabank, said fourth-quarter growth was good but not great: While that is a good outcome, it's not great - the survey based indicators suggest that we should have seen north of 1% quarter on quarter and labour data flying. Sadly disappointments in the construction data (which looks likely to be genuine due to a shortage of bricks) and only a pedestrian pace of services output held back Q4. The consensus outlook for 2014 as a whole is for 2.5% year-on-year growth. That implies that the quarter-on-quarter growth rate continues to soften slightly to just below 0.4% quarter-on-quarter by the end of the year. John Cridland, director-general of business group the CBI, said the outlook for 2014 was strong: The economy is growing and the recovery gathering momentum. This is good news, and we're seeing improvement across many different sectors. This is a strong platform for an even better year in 2014, and we expect the economy to continue to strengthen. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, agreed that quarterly growth of 0.7% was disappointing compared with stronger business surveys in recent weeks: The 0.7% rise in UK GDP in Q4 is a touch disappointing given the recent strength of the business surveys. But it still takes full-year growth in 2013 to 1.9%, the best performance since 2007 and possibly the strongest growth in the G7. Of course, output remains below its pre-crisis peak (by 1.3%). And, in levels terms, the UK's economy's performance remains pretty insipid compared with other major economies. Meanwhile, Q4's number was below the 0.9% expected by the MPC, although this may help to quell murmurs of some support among Committee members for an interest rate rise sooner rather than later. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said there was every reason to believe recovery was here to stay: Make no mistake, the recovery of the UK economy is not a flash in the pan. We are seeing renewed consumer spending, which should trigger a revival in investment spend. And combined with sustained low rates on the horizon, we are seeing a benign growth and liquidity outlook for investors. With annual GDP growth now outstripping inflation, could 2014 be the year we witness a disinflationary boom, where growth is actually higher than inflation for the first time in years. Such an outcome would make up much of the ground lost to stagflation of the recent past. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said growth in 2014 was likely to accelerate: We expect the economy to expand by 2.7% in 2014 with quarter-on-quarter growth centred around 0.6-0.7% through the year. While growth has become more broadly based on the output side of the economy (despite construction's relapse in the fourth quarter), there is concern that UK growth in 2013 was too dependent on consumer spending which is being partly fuelled by increased borrowing. However, it is important that the UK has finally sustained extended decent growth of any sort following its prolonged struggle to recover from the deep 2008/9 recession. This will hopefully wider recovery to now develop.",

      "bodyText": "There is a mannered concern in the Treasury over the state of the recovery. Despite outstripping most developed countries in the last 12 months, Britain's latest GDP growth demands furrowed brows and a degree of hand-wringing. Put the trumpets away, says George Osborne, there will be no triumphalism on my watch. It's a strange response when the figures are taken in isolation. A growth rate for the whole economy of almost 2% is healthy by today's standards even if it is weak compared with previous recoveries. Strengthening the chancellor's arm, the increase in activity in the past year has been a broad-based. Manufacturing has finally moved up a gear and construction firms have put spades in the ground. The services sector, which was already trundling along nicely, has helped bring down unemployment and inflation is in check. The momentum going into 2014 appears strong and a dip in construction in November is likely to prove temporary. Excluding oil and gas production, which is locked in a decade-long decline, the economy is only 0.3% smaller than its 2008 peak and not the 1.3% that the headline figures suggest. As senior economic adviser at PwC (and former MPC member) Andrew Sentance points out, if UK economy continues to grow at the same rate as the past three quarters, then average GDP growth this year will be around 3%. Sentance, who is convinced Britain is ready for a return to \"normal\" interest rates, is keen to demonstrate a buoyancy most other economists failed to detect in the UK from 2008 onwards. The calculation only works if the drag on growth from declining oil and gas is stripped out, but it is certainly one way of interpreting the figures. Sentance's view chimes with most right-wing thinktanks and less moderate Tories who believe businesses and households who are over-indebted should crash and burn, leaving cash-rich speculators to pick up the pieces on the cheap. It's raw capitalism and good for everyone in the long run, goes the argument. But as we know it is politically unacceptable for the coalition to go down this road. And that brings us to the hand-wringing. Vince Cable and his supporters are well aware there are key components of the recovery that are still Awol. Business investment kept falling last year when it was supposed to take over from consumer spending as one of the main drivers of growth. Export growth has stuttered to a halt, leaving us with a persistent balance of payments problem before the country really starts to spend and suck in huge amounts of imports. Then there is the London factor. Along with the south-east, the capital is bounding along while many regions are still propped up by the public sector. But concerns about the nature and sustainability of the recovery are only one restraint on triumphalism. The other is the need to continue selling austerity as a key election message. How can the government cheer while it tries to convince a weary electorate they must vote for more cuts? More importantly, the Tories need to capitalise on surveys that suggest Labour is not trusted to make tough decisions. For Osborne it is the key to electoral victory. As long as there are plenty of tough decisions to make in the second half of the decade, then those who worry about money will be reluctant to vote for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. Labour's lead has shrunk to 1% according to the latest Comres poll and behind the headline number is the lack of faith in Labour to make people richer. Whereas 39% have faith in David Cameron and Osborne to make them better off, only 29% place similar trust in Miliband and Balls.",

The UK\u2019s services and manufacturing sectors were the drivers of 0.7% growth in the fourth quarter, taking the annual growth rate to 1.9%, the strongest since 2007 before the financial crisis took hold. The economy grew in every quarter last year according to the Office for National Statistics, providing a significant boost for the chancellor who has persistently argued that a burgeoning recovery is proof that his economic plan is working.

Average wages of 0.9% are still less than half the rate of inflation, which was 2% in December.

Construction has been hit recently by a shortage of bricks, which has been a drag on the sector\u2019s recovery.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carpetright has warned that profits this year will fail to meet City forecasts because of an expected loss at its ailing business in the Netherlands. Like-for-like sales in the UK increased 1.9% in the three months to 25 January but they fell 6.3% in the rest of Europe, including the Netherlands, taking currency movements into account. Lord Harris, executive chairman of Carpetright, said: \"Trading in our rest-of-Europe business continues to be dominated by the extremely difficult economic conditions in the Netherlands. As a result we now expect this business unit to be loss-making for this financial year. \"In view of the market conditions, predicting the final outcome for the year with any accuracy is difficult and the result for the year will depend on our performance in the final quarter. With a further weakening of the market in the Netherlands, we now expect underlying pre-tax profits for the full year will be below the lower end of the current range of market expectations.\" Harris said trading in Britain was also difficult, although UK profit should be in line with the group's expectations and more than last year. The weak UK trading comes despite a revival in the housing market and mortgage approvals, which usually signal an upturn for Carpetright's business. The profit warning is the second time in less than four months that Carpetright has been forced to guide down City expectations. Weak demand in the UK and problems in the Netherlands prompted a grim trading update in early October when former chief executive Darren Shapland was ousted and Harris took over running the business. The 71-year-old founded Carpetright in 1988. He has promised to overhaul the business by refurbishing stores, expanding online, cancelling burdensome store leases and selling more beds. He said in the trading statement that these \"self-help\" measures had helped the group increase sales in a difficult market. Carpetright is one of the companies under investigation by the Office of Fair Trading over misleading pricing of special offers. Its rivals United Carpets and Floors2go settled with the OFT last week and agreed to improve the way they advertise offers to customers. Carpetright's financial year ends on 26 April and it is due to post full-year results on 24 June.",

The weak UK trading comes despite a revival in the housing market and mortgage approvals, which usually signal an upturn for Carpetright's business.</p> <p>The profit warning is the second time in less than four months that Carpetright has been forced to guide down City expectations. Weak demand in the UK and problems in the Netherlands prompted a grim trading update in early October when former chief executive Darren Shapland was ousted and Harris took over running the business.</p> <p>The 71-year-old founded Carpetright in 1988. He has promised to overhaul the business by refurbishing stores, expanding online, cancelling burdensome store leases and selling more beds. He said in the trading statement that these \"self-help\" measures had helped the group increase sales in a difficult market.</p> <p>Carpetright is one of the companies under investigation by the Office of Fair Trading over misleading pricing of special offers. Its rivals United Carpets and Floors2go settled with the OFT last week and agreed to improve the way they advertise offers to customers.</p> <p>Carpetright's financial year ends on 26 April and it is due to post full-year results on 24 June.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hopes that the recovery kept up momentum at the close of last year will be boosted by a report suggesting businesses are enjoying their strongest growth since before the financial crisis. Released ahead of official data on GDP growth, a new indicator from the business group CBI shows output for businesses across the private sector is rising at the fastest pace since the autumn of 2007. \"A picture is unfolding of a real upsurge in output across much of the UK economy,\" said Katja Hall, the CBI's chief policy director. \"Many firms in many sectors are feeling brighter about their prospects than they have for a long time, showing the recovery is gaining traction.\" City economists expect the first official estimate of growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 to show a slight slowdown from previous month but still put the UK's recovery ahead of that in other western European countries. The consensus forecast is for 0.7% growth during October to December after 0.8% expansion in both the second and third quarters. The year as a whole is expected to have clocked up the strongest growth since 2007, before the global financial crisis plunged the UK into a deep recession. The CBI said the outlook remained bright according to its new indicator, which covers around three-quarters of the private sector by combining the group's surveys of manufacturers, retailers and businesses in the services sector. The balance of firms reporting rising output over the three months to January, at +30, was the strongest since September 2007. The expectations balance for the coming three months was the highest since last October. The report's strong readings from the manufacturing sector are somewhat at odds with the official data that showed factories losing some momentum towards the end of 2013. If that picture is confirmed in Tuesday's official GDP numbers it will deal another blow to the government's hopes of rebalancing the economy away from reliance on consumer demand and towards manufacturing and exports. The CBI said strength was expected across all sectors over coming months but it conceded businesses needed to spend more to help cement the recovery. \"We certainly need companies investing more and creating a bigger footprint in fast-growing markets, and while some risks remain, we expect the economy to continue to strengthen through 2014,\" said Hall. The tone is also upbeat in a separate report out on Tuesday from the commercial property sector. In the final quarter of 2013 demand for shops and industrial units rose at the fastest pace for at least 15 years, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). Its poll of agents said increasing optimism about the UK economy and more accessible lending filtered through to commercial property to give the highest reading on the strength of demand since records began in 1998. Rent expectations rose and in the property investment market enquiries were also picking up. But publishing its report as floods continue to blight many parts of the country after another weekend of torrential rain, RICS warned changes to insurance rules could jeopardise growth for some areas. \"Due to the government's failure to bring in adequate insurance provisions to protect the likes of shops and offices in flood risk areas, we could well see smaller local economies hit hard,\" said Jeremy Blackburn, RICS UK head of policy.",
