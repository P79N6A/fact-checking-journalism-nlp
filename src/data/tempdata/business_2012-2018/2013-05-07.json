      "bodyText": "International Monetary Fund officials arrive in London today for their annual health check of Britain's economy as the government faces a fresh warning its austerity drive is causing a \"lost decade of growth\". Echoing the IMF's recent warning that George Osborne, the chancellor, needed to ease up on austerity cuts in the face of a stagnant economy, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has argued that the UK is being left behind in the global recovery. It said the UK is experiencing a slower economic recovery than 23 of the 33 advanced economies monitored by the IMF. The TUC report, issued to coincide with the arrival of the IMF mission, also claims the vast majority of eurozone countries are performing better. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"We truly are experiencing a lost decade for growth. While other countries are already seeing a rise in economic output, the UK won't return to its pre-crash level for another four years. \"The chancellor's commitment to self-defeating austerity has prolonged people's suffering and put the brakes on our economic recovery \u2013 so much so that escaping a triple-recession is considered by some to be a cause for celebration. Even George Osborne's favourite economic institution, the IMF, is calling on him to change course.\" Looking at income per head, the TUC warned the UK would not return to its pre-crash level until 2017. By contrast, income per head in Germany and the US would be more than 10% higher a decade on from the financial crisis. The TUC said the figures, based on the IMF's latest GDP forecasts, also revealed how the UK is emerging from recession at a slower rate than at any time in recent history. The report says: \"In 1985, UK income per head was 6% higher than it was before the 1980 crash. In 1995, UK income per head was 7% higher than it was before the 1990 recession. UK income per head is today still 6% below its 2008 level.\" Over the next two weeks IMF officials will be gathering information on the UK's economic prospects from the Treasury, Bank of England, private sector economists, trade union officials and the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The IMF deputy managing director, David Lipton, is then expected to hold a news conference on or around 22 May at the end of the discussions. IMF officials caused embarrassment for Osborne last month when, alarmed at the flatlining of the British economy in 2011 and 2012, they urged him to do more to boost growth and to rethink plans to cut the structural budget deficit by 1% of national income in 2013-14. The Washington-based organisation was initially a strong supporter of the coalition's approach to tackling the UK's record peacetime budget deficit. But its chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, singled out the UK as a country that had the scope to ease fiscal policy to boost growth. Osborne was particularly irritated by Blanchard's comment that the UK was \"playing with fire\" by refusing to change tack. Osborne, however, will stand firm at meetings with the IMF delegation. Treasury officials intend to show that any change to the strategy they have followed for the last three years would damage the government's credibility in the financial markets and the subsequent increase in long-term interest rates would outweigh any benefits from cutting taxes or increasing spending. The Treasury will say that the economy is gradually on the mend and that the IMF's anxiety about the weakness of growth has already been addressed in recent policy initiatives. They will also say that the sluggishness of the economy in 2012 was a result of the drop in exports to the crisis-hit eurozone, rather than weak consumer spending. The TUC argues that many eurozone economies, including France, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, are recovering faster in GDP per head terms and so Osborne \"cannot blame Europe for the UK's economic woes\". It wants the chancellor to ease off on austerity and focus more on jobs and spurs to growth and confidence such as an extensive house building programme. \"He should start learning from countries like the US whose ambitious programme of investment in jobs is helping to turn its economy around,\" said O'Grady. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"This is an own goal by Labour's paymasters. This analysis starts in 2008 and so includes the biggest recession in modern history \u2013 which happened under Labour. Clearing up the mess we inherited won't happen overnight.\" Chris Leslie, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: \"George Osborne should not arrogantly dismiss the advice of the IMF team flying into London this week. It is time the chancellor listened to their warnings that his failing economic policies are playing with fire and that Britain now needs a Plan B for jobs and growth.\" The IMF cut its forecast for UK growth in both 2013 and 2014 last month. Its publication \u2013 the half-yearly World Economic Outlook \u2013 said GDP would rise by 0 .7% this year and by 1.5% in 2014 \u2013 in both cases a cut of 0.3 points from its last set of predictions in January.",

At the heart of the problem are the country's ultra-conservative banks and building societies. Either they are short of funds or reluctant to lend to all but the most financially secure borrower. As Vince Cable put it yesterday, they are working on a \"pawnbroker business model\" demanding \"heaps of collateral\" that he likened to a gold watch. The result is that few small and medium-sized businesses can access the cheap credit on offer from the Bank of England. Homebuyers are in a similar fix. Some estate agents report that cash buyers make up almost 50% of the house purchases in recent months. Housebuilding remains at levels not seen since the 1920s. As you pointed out on your visit last year, the Treasury has room for manoeuvre should it want to promote growth. The trouble is that all the fiscal loosening this year will just go to overstressed hospitals, a bigger pension bill and a school system coping with a baby boom. There was little extra in the last budget for investment. Among the voices over here calling for a more cautious approach to austerity are the former City regulator Lord Turner, who warned yesterday that the slowdown caused by aggressive cuts could trigger a cycle of debt. \"I think the difficulty is that when the public debt levels go up in the crisis you feel you've got to get that under control \u2026\" said the former Financial Services Authority chairman. \"But if you try and get it under control quickly, by cutting public expenditure or increasing taxes in the short term, you can enter a cycle where the very process of trying to get your debt levels down mean you never get the debt levels down.\" You may decide that unemployment at 7.8% is lower than the eurozone average of 12.1% and therefore not too bad. But when combined with figures for underemployment, enforced self-employment and part-time working, a large percentage of the British workforce is not working at full tilt. Employment has risen to an all-time high of 30m, but only because of a rising population. Which brings us to wages. Average pay rises have remained stuck at 1% while inflation has stubbornly refused to drop below 2% and now rests at 2.8%. Recent industry surveys have put pay awards at nearer 2%, but this still leaves an income gap that eats away at living standards. Until consumers are back on their feet, the UK economy is going to suffer. Businesses are sitting on their hands, waiting for confidence to return. Even those firms that can access credit are wary of making major investments while the government plays a waiting game, hoping for something to turn up. Of course, the IMF is compromised by its demands for tighter austerity in the eurozone. It is hard to lecture Britain about missed growth opportunities after backing policies in Brussels that have sent an entire continent into recession. Such a volte face would seem to contradict a stance that has successfully impoverished so many in Portugal, Greece and Ireland. But surely you can see that the UK is crying out for investment that, in the first instance, could be pursued with public money. These are not Japanese-style investments, like the concreting of river beds, that create short term construction jobs but are of no lasting benefit. The UK needs houses, power plants and railway upgrades. They may not be glamorous but they are necessary, create jobs and get the wheels of the economy moving again.",

      "standfirst": "HP accused of ignoring evidence on 'vastly overvalued' acquisition while Autonomy founder denies financial impropriety", 
      "body": "<p>Hewlett-Packard tried to pull out of its $11bn (\u00a37bn) takeover of British software firm Autonomy before the deal closed, according to claims in a $1bn shareholder lawsuit brought against the US computer maker.</p> <p>HP's chief executive Meg Whitman, her predecessor L\u00e9o Apotheker, the company's former chairman Ray Lane and Autonomy founder Mike Lynch are among eight defendants named in the class action suit, filed at California's San Francisco district court, which accuses those who oversaw the botched deal of conducting \"cursory due diligence on a polluted and vastly overvalued asset\".</p> <p>Whitman and Lane \u2013 who resigned as chairman in April after a shareholder revolt \u2013 are accused of ignoring damaging evidence from whistleblowers and hiding their full concerns about the Autonomy deal. They allegedly employed \"devices, schemes and artifices to defraud\" shareholders into buying the stock, before eventually admitting HP had overpaid in November 2012.</p> <p>The revelation of an $8.8bn writedown of HP's book value, related to the Autonomy purchase, which came over a year after the acquisition was completed, wiped more than $3bn from the US company's market value in a single day. In a devastating overview, 101 pages of court documents seen by the Guardian tell the story of an HP board of directors too tired from infighting to effectively oversee the acquisition of Autonomy.</p> <p>The claim is that Apotheker was egged on by \"self-interested auditors, Wall Street bankers and other investment advisers who facilitated HP's severely reckless pursuit of Autonomy in exchange for nearly $100m in fees\". The lawsuit claims that Lynch, having exaggerated his company's performance to investors, was \"hoping to cash out of Autonomy before it collapsed under the weight of its own fraud\".</p> <p>Lynch strongly rejects any financial impropriety, and says Autonomy received unqualified audit reports during his leadership.</p> <p>\"Unbeknownst to investors,\" court filings claim, \"HP was actively seeking to withdraw its offer to purchase Autonomy\" before the 3 October 2011 deadline. By this time Whitman, who had been a member of the board that approved the purchase, had replaced Apotheker as chief executive.

      "bodyText": "Hewlett-Packard tried to pull out of its $11bn (\u00a37bn) takeover of British software firm Autonomy before the deal closed, according to claims in a $1bn shareholder lawsuit brought against the US computer maker. HP's chief executive Meg Whitman, her predecessor L\u00e9o Apotheker, the company's former chairman Ray Lane and Autonomy founder Mike Lynch are among eight defendants named in the class action suit, filed at California's San Francisco district court, which accuses those who oversaw the botched deal of conducting \"cursory due diligence on a polluted and vastly overvalued asset\". Whitman and Lane \u2013 who resigned as chairman in April after a shareholder revolt \u2013 are accused of ignoring damaging evidence from whistleblowers and hiding their full concerns about the Autonomy deal. They allegedly employed \"devices, schemes and artifices to defraud\" shareholders into buying the stock, before eventually admitting HP had overpaid in November 2012. The revelation of an $8.8bn writedown of HP's book value, related to the Autonomy purchase, which came over a year after the acquisition was completed, wiped more than $3bn from the US company's market value in a single day. In a devastating overview, 101 pages of court documents seen by the Guardian tell the story of an HP board of directors too tired from infighting to effectively oversee the acquisition of Autonomy. The claim is that Apotheker was egged on by \"self-interested auditors, Wall Street bankers and other investment advisers who facilitated HP's severely reckless pursuit of Autonomy in exchange for nearly $100m in fees\". The lawsuit claims that Lynch, having exaggerated his company's performance to investors, was \"hoping to cash out of Autonomy before it collapsed under the weight of its own fraud\". Lynch strongly rejects any financial impropriety, and says Autonomy received unqualified audit reports during his leadership. \"Unbeknownst to investors,\" court filings claim, \"HP was actively seeking to withdraw its offer to purchase Autonomy\" before the 3 October 2011 deadline. By this time Whitman, who had been a member of the board that approved the purchase, had replaced Apotheker as chief executive. The suit claims she was aware of Autonomy's supposedly questionable practices from analyst and press reports. Lane is alleged to have asked HP's financial advisers, Barclays and Perella Weinberg, to check whether his company could back out of the deal. Because the board had been aware of accusations that Autonomy's management were exaggerating their company's performance before the offer was made, the UK Takeover Panel would reject any plea by HP to walk away, Lane was reportedly told. This part of the suit is based on a report in the Wall Street Journal. \"Rather than engage in embarrassing failed foreign litigation with Autonomy,\" the filings say, Lane, Whitman and HP's finance director \"resolved to try to quietly clean up the HP/Autonomy debacle internally.\" They were only forced into a full disclosure in May 2012, when a senior Autonomy executive blew the whistle on serious accounting improprieties with HP's top lawyer John Schultz, the claim alleges. Whitman responded by asking accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers to investigate, but these developments were \"concealed\" from investors until November. The claimants identify four whistleblowers, three of whom came forward before the deal was completed. They are UK financial analyst Paul Morland, who wrote to HP's investor relations department in September 2011 to \"tell them they were making a big mistake\"; a former Autonomy finance executive who told the British company's auditor Deloitte of \"improper accounting\"; and the author of a widely circulated email which questioned Autonomy's claims about the popularity of its flagship software. Despite these red flags, HP's due diligence checks on Autonomy lasted just three weeks. The British company \"refused\" to hand over copies of financial documents supporting its audits, limiting HP's review to only publicly reported financial statements and about 25 sales contracts, the filings claim. The case is brought on behalf of all investors who bought HP shares between 19 August 2011 \u2013 the day after the takeover was announced \u2013 and 20 November 2012, when HP came clean about the full extent of its concerns. The suit, filed on Friday, is led by the Dutch pension fund PGGM Vermogensbeheer, which last year was part of a group of investors that sued Bank of America for $2.4bn over its purchase of Merrill Lynch, and believes it lost $35m on its HP investments. The case is being brought by Ramzi Abadou, a partner at law firm Kessler Topaz Meltzer &amp; Check, who previously helped recover $930m for shareholders of UnitedHealth Group. A hearing may follow later this year and depending on how many other shareholders join the action, it is understood damages could exceed $1bn. \"As we have continually said, HP relied on the audited financial statements and the representations of Autonomy's management and its auditors regarding Autonomy's business and revenue,\" HP said in a statement. \"Those facts and figures appear to have been willfully manipulated by certain Autonomy employees prior to the company's acquisition, to mislead investors and potential buyers.\"",

      "body": "<p>Top tax advisers at Ernst &amp; Young, auditors to Google, Amazon and Facebook, have held a high-level lobbying meeting at Number 10, urging the prime minister not to support calls for financial transparency measures which have been proposed by tax fairness campaigners.</p> <p>E&amp;Y's UK head of tax John Dixon said he and the firm's global head of tax policy Chris Sanger had taken their lobbying message to Downing Street because \"it is not an issue that is going to go away and it is receiving a huge amount of interest at the highest level of our society\".</p> <p>Tax Justice Network (TJN), Global Witness, Save the Children, Cafod and the ActionAid are <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/sites/pwypdev.gn.apc.org/files/Membership%20PDF.pdf\" title=\"\">among the many charities and campaign groups</a> urging governments and the G20 to impose tough rules on multinationals forcing them to report separately on their financial activity for each country in which they operate.</p> <p>Tax fairness campaigners believe this will help expose aggressive attempts by multinationals to use intra-group transactions as a means to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions.</p> <p>So-called country-by-country reporting has already been imposed on mining and oil extraction groups by the US and is shortly to be extended to banks by the EU. \"The floodgates are, however, not yet open,\" said Dixon in a <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Tax_Transparency_-_Seizing_the_initiative/$FILE/EY_Tax_Transparency.pdf\" title=\"\">paper published yesterday</a>.</p> <p>He suggested multinationals should \"seize the initiative\" and called on them to consider measures to \"appease the fair tax lobby\" if they want to head off mounting calls for tougher rules to stop them shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions.</p> <p>David Cameron, who will host the G8 next month at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland, has made tax transparency a major plank of the summit. Earlier this year he signalled that developing world countries should be able to access information needed \"to tackle abuses in the system, so that governments can collect taxes due to them\".</p> <p>Dixon warned pressure to reform the tax treatment of global businesses had reached a \"tipping point\", adding: \"If there is not a step change in the level of voluntary tax transparency reporting, there is a possibility mandatory changes will follow.\"</p> <p>E&amp;Y calls for voluntary tax reform were met with some scepticism by long-standing tax campaigners. \"It has to be an exercise in wishful thinking to suggest companies can reform without international standards being imposed upon them,\" said John Christensen, director of Tax Justice Network (TJN). \"It [the E&amp;Y report] sounds a bit like: 'God make me good, but not quite yet'.\"</p> <p>Last weekend, E&amp;Y chairman Steve Varley told a Sunday newspaper that measures to increase Britain's tax competitiveness were beginning to attract a wave of international companies relocating to the UK. \"I know of more than 40 multinational companies that have been looking to undertake global and regional headquarter relocations into Britain,\" Varley said.</p> <p>E&amp;Y's calls for voluntary tax disclosures were echoed yesterday by CBI which also called for greater transparency in a \"statement of tax principles\" that it said were needed to restore the public's trust in corporate Britain.

      "bodyText": "Top tax advisers at Ernst &amp; Young, auditors to Google, Amazon and Facebook, have held a high-level lobbying meeting at Number 10, urging the prime minister not to support calls for financial transparency measures which have been proposed by tax fairness campaigners. E&amp;Y's UK head of tax John Dixon said he and the firm's global head of tax policy Chris Sanger had taken their lobbying message to Downing Street because \"it is not an issue that is going to go away and it is receiving a huge amount of interest at the highest level of our society\". Tax Justice Network (TJN), Global Witness, Save the Children, Cafod and the ActionAid are among the many charities and campaign groups urging governments and the G20 to impose tough rules on multinationals forcing them to report separately on their financial activity for each country in which they operate. Tax fairness campaigners believe this will help expose aggressive attempts by multinationals to use intra-group transactions as a means to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. So-called country-by-country reporting has already been imposed on mining and oil extraction groups by the US and is shortly to be extended to banks by the EU. \"The floodgates are, however, not yet open,\" said Dixon in a paper published yesterday. He suggested multinationals should \"seize the initiative\" and called on them to consider measures to \"appease the fair tax lobby\" if they want to head off mounting calls for tougher rules to stop them shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions. David Cameron, who will host the G8 next month at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland, has made tax transparency a major plank of the summit. Earlier this year he signalled that developing world countries should be able to access information needed \"to tackle abuses in the system, so that governments can collect taxes due to them\". Dixon warned pressure to reform the tax treatment of global businesses had reached a \"tipping point\", adding: \"If there is not a step change in the level of voluntary tax transparency reporting, there is a possibility mandatory changes will follow.\" E&amp;Y calls for voluntary tax reform were met with some scepticism by long-standing tax campaigners. \"It has to be an exercise in wishful thinking to suggest companies can reform without international standards being imposed upon them,\" said John Christensen, director of Tax Justice Network (TJN). \"It [the E&amp;Y report] sounds a bit like: 'God make me good, but not quite yet'.\" Last weekend, E&amp;Y chairman Steve Varley told a Sunday newspaper that measures to increase Britain's tax competitiveness were beginning to attract a wave of international companies relocating to the UK. \"I know of more than 40 multinational companies that have been looking to undertake global and regional headquarter relocations into Britain,\" Varley said. E&amp;Y's calls for voluntary tax disclosures were echoed yesterday by CBI which also called for greater transparency in a \"statement of tax principles\" that it said were needed to restore the public's trust in corporate Britain. John Cridland, boss of the business lobby group, said the business community was aware that it needed to explain more fully its financial contribution to society. \"We are encouraging firms to introduce narrative reporting, preferably on a sheet of A4 in the annual report, that tells the story in an accessible way about how much tax has been paid and why,\" he said. The CBI is concerned that Downing Street will seek to deflect growing criticism of corporate tax avoiders with proposals that require companies to produce country-by-country details of their tax payments. In January, Dixon admitted to MPs that the OECD rulebook for taxing multinationals \"needs to be addressed\" in the wake of the emergence of digital businesses. However, the E&amp;Y tax boss has now set out his firm opposition to transparency measures advocated by campaign groups. Dixon said E&amp;Y had carried out a survey of UK firms and found that 70% of tax professionals were opposed to so-called country-by-country reporting. \"I think you have got to come to the conclusion this [calls for tougher policing of multinationals' tax affairs] is not going to go away,\" said Dixon. \"We are actively advising companies that they need to address the issue... They need to think about what type of transparency they should adopt, and how they should adopt it and where they should adopt it.\" His remarks come a week after Margaret Hodge, chair of parliament's public accounts committee, suggested Dixon \u2014 who has already faced a grilling by MPs in January \u2014 might shortly be recalled to give further evidence over the tax affairs of Google along an executive from the search group. No formal request has yet been sent to him. E&amp;Y has global tax revenues of $6bn and employs about 29,000 experts in offices around the world offering tax advice to clients including multinational groups with controversial tax arrangements such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Hewlett Packard.

For most of the first decade of his 13-year reign as chief executive, the company was widely regarded as a lumbering giant that was failing to capitalise fully on its well-stocked cabinet of spirits brands. And leadership in Scotch whisky was seen as defining Diageo as an old-school drinks company that would be outpaced by smaller and nimbler rivals. It was only when Walsh in 2011 set out some medium-term targets for growth that investors woke up to the powerful cash machine in their midst. Diageo could increase sales at 6% a year, he said, while lifting profits margins, thus producing double-digit rises in earnings per share. As those pledges were seen as credible, so the share price took off, from \u00a312 in August 2011 to almost \u00a320 today. The late run has put the shine on the impressive statistics under Walsh: \u00a3100 invested when he became chief executive in September 2000 has become \u00a3538 today, calculates Investec. Not quite as good as Pernod, but still excellent. The part of the story that investors initially missed was the company's ability to persuade Asia's aspiring middle classes that they should be aspiring to drink whisky, and Diageo's whiskies in particular. The Johnnie Walker houses in Shanghai and Beijing seem designed to cater for ostentatious displays of wealth (the malts become expensive as one travels upwards to the bars on the buildings' upper floors) but the formula seems to work in communist China. Developing markets are booming for Diageo while the US division is stronger than ever. This is a company with substantial pricing power. Walsh will say a long goodbye to Diageo. Ivan Menezes, who has been a shoo-in for the top job since becoming chief operating officer in March last year, will become chief executive in July. But Walsh will stay on for another year to concentrate on \"transitioning critical partner and external relationships,\" whatever that means. He will retain his \u00a31.2m salary while he performs this \"transitioning\". Quite why he should be paid the same in a supporting role is not explained.

      "bodyText": "A failed mega-bid, the Olympics shambles and now a major profits warning. So much for the idea that G4S is a dull company in the dull industry of support services. Suddenly it looks as if anything can happen at Nick Buckles' outfit. At least investors knew how to deal with his \u00a35.2bn tilt at Danish firm ISS in October 2011: they told him not to be so silly as to bet the balance sheet trying to create a company that would have had 1.1 million employees. As for the Olympics fiasco, it was clearly a one-off and the financial pain was bearable. But a sizeable dent in the carefully constructed G4S profit margins is more serious for the share price. Profit margins have been solid at 7%-ish for years. Now 6.5%, the worst outcome since 2006, has arrived out of the blue. The difference may not sound like much, but in a business with a \u00a37.5bn turnover, a half percentage point of profit margin matters. What's the problem? It's more a case of a series of problems, says Buckles. Continental Europe is tough, especially with the closure of 30 prisons in the Netherlands; there's a price war with Loomis in cash-handling in the UK and Ireland; lower volumes, and thus lower margins, have been seen in key contracts with the UK government, including a 15% drop in prisoners with electronic tags; and there's a \u00a36m hit from bad debts in Africa. Buckles predicts a profit margin of 7% can be regained, but probably not next year. Optimists will say that G4S's financial ratios remain the best in the business and that some of those hiccups, like the Netherlands' prison reorganisation, are genuinely hard to predict. But it also looks as if the UK government has decided to get smarter in procurement and to squeeze harder on price. If so, there's a limit to how far G4S can offset the pressure with cost savings. The 15% plunge in the shares, taking them back to levels seen three years ago, suggests investors fear life will become permanently harder for G4S in budget-constrained Europe. And, with the benefit of hindsight, you have to wonder whether the run at ISS was an attempt to forestall pricing pressures that the management feared might arrive one day. Too late now.",

Photograph: TOBIAS SCHWARZ/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>And here's AP's latest take, by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbaetz\">Juergen Baetz</a>.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici on Tuesday hailed the European Union's decision to grant his country more time to tackle its deficit as a turning point in the region's approach to austerity, which is choking off growth through spending cuts and tax hikes.</p> <p>Cutting budget deficits remains important but the 27-nation bloc must now move toward a more growth-friendly \"doctrine of positive deficit reduction,\" Moscovici said, speaking at a Berlin university alongside his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schaeuble.</p> <p>That means tightening the budget when the economy is stronger and easing off the cuts in times of weaker growth, such as now.</p> <p>The EU Commission, the bloc's executive arm, hinted Friday that it will grant France two more years to get its deficit below the limit of 3 percent of annual output to account for the current economic downturn.</p> <p>Otherwise, Paris would have had to resort to more drastic measures \"either in the form of more taxes or in the form of yet bigger cuts which would have been absolutely harmful for the French economy,\" Moscovici said.</p> <p>EU countries have focused on debt reduction as the main policy to restore market confidence in the region's public finances over the past three years. But the spending cuts and tax increases have been hurting the economy and proved less effective at reducing deficits than initially thought. As economies shrink, so do their tax revenues, potentially making it harder to close budget gaps.</p> <p>Moscovici said France does not view the additional time the EU has granted it as an incentive to slow down the pace of its structural economic reforms, saying \"it's not an invitation to laziness.\"</p> <p>\"France is a serious country, conducting credible policies,\" Moscovici added.</p> <p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Schaeuble have so far championed a course of budget tightening and structural reforms to overcome the eurozone's debt crisis, insisting in many cases on austerity measures that deepened the recession in crisis-hit nations like Greece, Portugal or Spain.</p> <p>\"I know that the decision (by the European Commission) has raised questions in Germany,\" Moscovici acknowledged. But he stressed that it is in Germany's own interest that France, the bloc's second-largest economy, returns to growth.</p> <p>\"We need a strong France,\" he said, noting that only France and Germany together can push European integration forward. The two nations together count for almost half of the eurozone's population and its economic output.</p> <p>\"We are not everything in Europe, but without Germany and France nothing advances in Europe,\" Schaeuble added.</p> <p>Schaeuble called the European Commission's decision on France \"appropriate\" and insisted that it was a misunderstanding to think Europe was divided, with some governments seeking austerity and others growth.<br> \"We have always said we jointly want sustainable growth, for which solid public finances are a precondition,\" he said.</p> <p>The bloc must make it a priority to fight unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular, or the EU stands the risk of \"losing legitimacy and credibility,\" he said.</p> <p>The eurozone overall is stuck in recession and unemployment is expected to hit an average of 12.2% this year, up from 11.4% in 2012.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518909efe4b0917c6345be2b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-07T14:04:31.597Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Europe, and Britain's place in it, has dominated the political scene today after former chancellor, <strong>Lord Lawson</strong>, called for the UK to quit the EU.</p> <p>Lawson's claimed that David Cameron will fail to win new concessions from the rest of Europe, meaning the PM's plan for an In-Out referendum could see many of his own side campaign for an exit.</p> <p>His intervention comes just a few days after the UK Independent Party made strong gains in our local council elections. </p> <p>My colleague <strong>Andrew Sparrow</strong> has been tracking all the reaction to Lawson's intervention in Politics Live today - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2013/may/07/nigel-lawson-uk-eu-politics-live#block-5188efb5e4b01a34b123f86e\">here's his lunchtime round-up</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51890524e4b01a34b123f897\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-07T13:44:05.075Z\">2.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dijsselbloem: small savers shouldn't worry</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A couple more interesting lines from Eurogroup president <strong>Jeroen Dijsselbloem</strong>'s appearance before the European Parliament (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/may/07/eurozone-crisis-australia-rates-markets-france#block-5188f98fe4b0917c6345be08\">see 1.54pm onwards</a>).</p> <p>He told MEPs that he could 'reassure' savers that deposits up to \u20ac100,000 were safe, and that Cyprus was not a template (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/25/cyprus-bailout-dijsselbloem-chaos-markets\">a touchy subject</a>) for future bailouts.</p> <p><strong>Dijsselbloem</strong> also predicted that many European countries will return to growth in the second half of 2013.

It cited China's recent slowdown and the ongoing Eurozone recession as reasons to ease monetary policy now.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2013/mr-13-10.html\">In a statement</a>, governor <strong>Glenn Stevens</strong> explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The global economy is likely to record growth a little below trend this year, before picking up next year. Among the major regions, the United States continues on a path of moderate expansion and China's growth is running at a more sustainable, but still robust, pace.</p> <p>Japan has announced significant new policy initiatives aimed at strengthening demand and ending deflation. The euro area remains in recession. Commodity prices have moderated a little in recent months though they remain high by historical standards.</p> </blockquote> <p>Australia had been booming last year, thanks in part to strong demand for its commodities from China's factories. But the drop in Chinese GDP growth has had a knock-on effect. As Stevens explained, economic growth in Australia appeared to be 'a little below trend' this year, while unemployment was inching higher - to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-11/australia-s-unemployment-rate-unexpectedly-rises-to-3-year-high.html\">a new three-year high of 5.6%</a>.</p> <p>But the country is still in relatively decent shape, though.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. Here's a brisk closing summary: \u2022 France's finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, has welcomed the EC's decision to relax its deficit targets. On a visit to Berlin, Moscovici said Europe had reached a turning point, and was now embracing a growth-friendly \"doctrine of positive deficit reduction\". With France now getting until 2015 to bring its deficit below 3% - a two-year extension - there was also little sign of the tension that has tarnished relations between Europe's two largest economies. Germany's Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told reporters that the two countries were united in seeking \"sustainable growth\", based on \"solid public finances\". See 3.31pm for details and photos. \u2022 The head of the Eurogroup has warned that Europe's banks may still be hiding undeclared bad debts. Jeroen Dijsselbloem said it was important that new instruments are created to handle bank recapitalisations, and to close a bank down if needed. The comments raised fears that large depositors could face losses once the single supervisory mechanism is created. See 10.52am for details, and 5.53pm for possible implications for UK savers with accounts in the eurozone. \u2022 Jeroen Dijsselbloem also clashed with MEPs today, after refusing to reveal full details of how the Cyprus bailout package was finalised. He also defended the country's unprecedented capital controls as unfortunate but necessary to avoid the disaster of a bank run, and blamed Cyprus's plight on its failure to regulate its banks properly (see 1.54pm onwards). \u2022 Australia became the latest country to ease its monetary policy, with a quarter-point cut in interest rates. The move led to point-scoring between the country's policians (see 8.31am for details, and 12.38pm for the row) \u2022 There were mixed economic signals from the eurozone. France's industrial output fell by 0.9% in March (see 8.50am), but German factory orders rose by 2.2% (see 11.53am). \u2022 Slovenia's race to avoid a bailout took another twist. A parliamentary vote on imposing a deficit cap was delayed after politicians failed to agree details (see 4.50pm). \u2022 And there was relief in Portugal, and Brussels, as the country's first 10-year bond sale since it applied for a bailout attracted strong demand (see 4.16pm). I\"ll be back tomorrow. Until then, thanks and goodnight. Thousands of medical staff in Madrid have held a 24-hour strike today, in protest at plans to privatise hospitals as part of the government's austerity programme. It's the first in a series of planned walkouts, in an attempt to block the regional government's plan to tender the management of six public hospitals to private companies. Doctors and nurses also held an unofficial referendum, asking members of the public to vote on whether they supported or opposed the sale: The protest shut down all but urgent care in 34 hospitals and dozens of health centres in the autonomous community of Madrid, according to Reuters, which adds: \"This will affect the quality of service at these hospitals, without a doubt,\" said Susana Hernandez, 45, doctor of internal medicine at one of the hospitals on the target list. \"They move the flow of patients to benefit the privatised hospitals, while the companies' first priority is always profit. We've asked for their figures to show how much they'll save, but their stats show this sale is a bargain (for the companies).\" Over in the Daily Telegraph, Bruno Waterfield reckons that British savers may be alarmed by Jeroen Dijsselbloem's comments today about the need to scrutinise Europe's banks for bad loans (see 10.52am) He writes: Uninsured depositors and bondholders in eurozone banks could face imposed losses following stress tests carried out before a \u201csingle-supervisory mechanism\u201d headed by the European Central Bank begins work next June. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of eurozone finance ministers, warned that that the ECB checks on the quality of banking assets could lead to banks being shut down, highlighting the need for eurozone agreement on bank resolution rules this summer. The prospect of eurozone banks facing closure will alarm British expatriates who live and have transferred their savings, proceeds from house sales and other assets to eurozone bank accounts in countries such as France, Spain and Italy. Of course, we don't know what nasties those stress tests might throw up and Dijsselbloem was also pretty insistent that insured depositors (with less than \u20ac100,000) should be protected if a bank fails. But City analysts do fear that certain Eurozone banks haven't accepted the full scale of the bad debts on their books. These stress tests could make for a lively summer..... Bloomberg also has a good write-up about the state of play in European banking regulation: Dijsselbloem Says EU Needs Common Deposit Backstop in Long Run Germany's DAX index has closed at a new lifetime high, on another day of rising stock markets. In London the FTSE 100 also finished at a five and a half-year high, despite security firm G4S tumbling almost 15% after warning its profit margins were under pressure (story here) Here's the closing prices: \u2022 German DAX: up 69 points at 8181, +0.8% \u2022 FTSE 100: up 35 points at 6557, + 0.55% \u2022 French CAC: up 14 points at 3921, +0.37% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 40 points at 8544, + 0.47% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 258 points at 17121 + 1.5% Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index, explains that the current loose monetary policy means investors can shrug off disappointing news (like this morning's weak French industrial production) while being cheered by any optimistic developments (Germany's forecast-busting factory output). The stimulus actions of the world\u2019s central banks have acted as an efficient stop loss against bearish fluctuations. This has turned bad news into good news and good news into great news. Investors have viewed heavy price weakness as buying opportunities and as long as that continues, market trends are maintained with large support. Investors have so far turned a blind eye to when 'the central bank music stops' meaning that right now, the risks of missing out on equity moves higher are greater than being caught long the market during violent price corrections. This risk on appetite continues to support equities. UK, US and German sovereign debt all fell in value today, pushing up yields, which also suggests investors were moving from bonds into shares. The Slovenian govenrment has postponed a parliamentary vote on a proposal to create a deficit cap until the end of May, amid ongoing deadlock with the opposition. With the threat of a bailout looming, Slovenia had promised to set the borrowing cap this month, but it's political parties can't agree the details - including when it should be implemented. The disagreement comes as Alenka Bratusek, Slovenia's new PM, tries to finalise the details of an economic reform plan, due for release on Thursday. Reuters has more details: The fiscal reform entails changing the constitution, which requires a two-thirds majority in parliament. The centre-left government coalition controls 49 out of 90 parliamentary seats.The postponement could sow further doubt over the ability of Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek's government to push through unpopular reforms to stabilise the country's finances and stop it becoming the latest member of the 17-nation currency bloc to need a bailout. The government is due to unveil a reform package on Thursday, but investors are doubtful of its readiness to cut spending and reduce the level of state ownership in the economy. It bought some breathing space last week when it managed to issue two bonds to a joint value of $3.5 billion on Thursday, while government sources told Reuters on Monday the country plans to sell its second largest bank Nova KBM NKBM.LJ KBM.WA and telecoms operator Telekom Slovenia TLSG.LJ this year to raise budget income. The vote is now expected to be held between May 20 and 24, assuming the various parties reach an agreement. Bratusek's government wants the cap imposed from 2017, but the opposition favours 2015. There is relief in Brussels after Portugal saw strong demand for a new 10-year \u20ac3bn bond which went on sale this morning. Yves Mersch, Luxembourg's top central banker, declared this afternoon that the auction was an 'enormous succes', and showed investors supported Portugal following its tough austerity programme. The head of Portugul's debt agency revealed this morning that it had received \u20ac9bn-worth of orders, and City insiders reckon it was priced at an interest rate of around 5.6%. The successful debt auction indicate that Lisbon may be able to return to the financial markets when its bailout programme ends this year. But it also looks like another sign that traders are increasingly desperate to find yield -- with safe-haven debt like US Treasuries and German Bunds offering such meagre returns today. Over the weekend Portugal announced another raft of public spending cuts, including 30,000 layoffs across the civil sector, in a bid to keep its austerity programme on track. Sony Kapoor of the Re-Definte think tank reckons it's too early to be celebrating: Another interest rate cut, this time in Kenya, where the central bank has sliced a whole percentage point off borrowing costs, to 8.5%. The Central Bank of Kenya cited the eurozone's financial problems as one reason for the bigger-than-expected cut, along with falling inflation. In a statement, it said: The Committee noted that the persistent strain in the eurozone coupled with the balance of payment pressures attributed to the high current account deficit, currently estimated at 11.4 percent of GDP, remain threats to the macroeconomic outlook. Here's a few photos from the 25th anniversary of the Franco-German Finance and Economic Council today, where French finance minister Pierre Moscovici claimed Europe was changing its approach to austerity by relaxing France's deficit targets (as covered at 11.17am). And here's AP's latest take, by Juergen Baetz. French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici on Tuesday hailed the European Union's decision to grant his country more time to tackle its deficit as a turning point in the region's approach to austerity, which is choking off growth through spending cuts and tax hikes. Cutting budget deficits remains important but the 27-nation bloc must now move toward a more growth-friendly \"doctrine of positive deficit reduction,\" Moscovici said, speaking at a Berlin university alongside his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schaeuble. That means tightening the budget when the economy is stronger and easing off the cuts in times of weaker growth, such as now. The EU Commission, the bloc's executive arm, hinted Friday that it will grant France two more years to get its deficit below the limit of 3 percent of annual output to account for the current economic downturn. Otherwise, Paris would have had to resort to more drastic measures \"either in the form of more taxes or in the form of yet bigger cuts which would have been absolutely harmful for the French economy,\" Moscovici said. EU countries have focused on debt reduction as the main policy to restore market confidence in the region's public finances over the past three years. But the spending cuts and tax increases have been hurting the economy and proved less effective at reducing deficits than initially thought. As economies shrink, so do their tax revenues, potentially making it harder to close budget gaps. Moscovici said France does not view the additional time the EU has granted it as an incentive to slow down the pace of its structural economic reforms, saying \"it's not an invitation to laziness.\" \"France is a serious country, conducting credible policies,\" Moscovici added. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Schaeuble have so far championed a course of budget tightening and structural reforms to overcome the eurozone's debt crisis, insisting in many cases on austerity measures that deepened the recession in crisis-hit nations like Greece, Portugal or Spain. \"I know that the decision (by the European Commission) has raised questions in Germany,\" Moscovici acknowledged. But he stressed that it is in Germany's own interest that France, the bloc's second-largest economy, returns to growth. \"We need a strong France,\" he said, noting that only France and Germany together can push European integration forward. The two nations together count for almost half of the eurozone's population and its economic output. \"We are not everything in Europe, but without Germany and France nothing advances in Europe,\" Schaeuble added. Schaeuble called the European Commission's decision on France \"appropriate\" and insisted that it was a misunderstanding to think Europe was divided, with some governments seeking austerity and others growth. \"We have always said we jointly want sustainable growth, for which solid public finances are a precondition,\" he said. The bloc must make it a priority to fight unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular, or the EU stands the risk of \"losing legitimacy and credibility,\" he said. The eurozone overall is stuck in recession and unemployment is expected to hit an average of 12.2% this year, up from 11.4% in 2012. Europe, and Britain's place in it, has dominated the political scene today after former chancellor, Lord Lawson, called for the UK to quit the EU. Lawson's claimed that David Cameron will fail to win new concessions from the rest of Europe, meaning the PM's plan for an In-Out referendum could see many of his own side campaign for an exit. His intervention comes just a few days after the UK Independent Party made strong gains in our local council elections. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has been tracking all the reaction to Lawson's intervention in Politics Live today - here's his lunchtime round-up. A couple more interesting lines from Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem's appearance before the European Parliament (see 1.54pm onwards). He told MEPs that he could 'reassure' savers that deposits up to \u20ac100,000 were safe, and that Cyprus was not a template (a touchy subject) for future bailouts. Dijsselbloem also predicted that many European countries will return to growth in the second half of 2013. Thus it's important to repair Europe's a banks now, so they can offer credit to sustain that growth, he argued. That might be too late, though, suggests Matina Stevis of the WSJ: Jeroen Dijsselbloem also insists Cyprus brought its current grief on itself, telling MPs that the country's problems were not caused by Europe, but by a \"badly run financial sector\". The Eurogroup president also declared that the final Cyprus rescue package is \"the best possible way\" to tackle the situation. Another MEP asks Dijsselbloem whether he actually believes the debt sustainability report drawn up for Cyprus, given the huge damage done to its banking sector. After an \"ah\" and an \"ummm\", Dijsselbloem replied that he relies on the EC and IMF's economic forecasts. Jeroen Dijsselbloem is refusing to answer detailed questions over exactly how the Cyprus debacle came about. Several MEPs on the Economics and Monetary affairs committee are demanding to know who said and did what, when, in the top-level Eurogroup negotiations in March that led to the first Cyprus deal (in which all savers were to be taxed). With MEPs sounding increasingly unimpressed, the eurogroup president said: I'm very sorry that you find it unacceptable, but I won't do that. Dijsselbloem also denied actiing like a 'king' by refusing to reveal details of the negotiations: I'm no king - we've just installed a king in Netherlands, one king is enough. Dijsselbloem was also given a blast by Sylvie Goulard, MEP, who accused him of acting like an \"optimistic undertaker\": This is a better link to watch Jeroen Dijsselbloem facing questions about Cypus at the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Dijsselbloem has told MEPS that there has been little, if any, direct fallout from the Cyprus bailout on the rest of the eurozone -- ie, no bank runs. The eurogroup president also insisted that the capital controls being enforced in Cyprus were \"very unfortunate\", but also \"inevitable\", to avoid banks in the country collapsing. And he's reiterating his points from this morning that Europe needs a proper 'resolution mechanism' for failing banks. Migration into Germany has hit a 17-year high, after 1.08 million immigrants arrived in the country last year. The Federal Statistics Office reported a big jump in the number of people arriving from Southern Europe -- with Spanish immigrants up 40%. But, the total numbers moving from the eurozone periphery remained low, with 34,109 arriving from Greece (up around 10,000) and 29,910 from Spain (up around 9,000), plus an extra 4,000 from Portugal and 12,000 from Italy. Thanks to regular reader/commenter RobertSchuman for flagging up the figures, and pointing out: I am very surprised that the numbers remain that low. The German demographics report released last week stated that Germany needs 6 mio. immigrants in the next 12 years and calls for measures to improve support to immigrants. The data also showed that over 176,000 people arrived from Poland, and around 116,000 from Romania. Heads-up (2). Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Pierre Moscovici are giving a press conference in Berlin now. The German finance minister declared that Germany and France will stand together to defend the eurozone, and also told the media that he had confidence in the French government, and the European Commission. (newsflashes via Bloomberg). More to follow shortly Heads-up (1): Jeroen Dijsselbloem is about to be questioned by MEPs over the Cyprus bailout (see Matina's tweet for the link). The FTSE 100 has reached its highest level since December 2007, the early days of the financial crisis. Hot on the heels of the German Dax's all-time high (see 10.21am), London's blue-chip index rose 30 points to 6552. It was helped by the news that HSBC had doubled its profits in the first three months of 2013 (more here) Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, explained: Once again the \u2018world\u2019s local bank\u2019 is reaping the reward of its focus on emerging markets rather than the moribund European economy, with Chinese growth expected to increase during the rest of this year. Australia's overnight interest rate cut (see 8.31am) sparked a merry political spat betwen the government and the opposition. Treasurer Wayne Swan got the ball rolling by pointing out that headline borrowing costs were now lower than under the previous government, A family with a $300,000 mortgage is now paying $5500 a year less than in 2007, when John Howard's government left office, Swan told reporters, adding that: There will continue to be big savings flowing through to families and of course small business. But the rate cut looked quite different to shadow treasurer Joe Hockey, who warned that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was having to pull the monetary levers because of fiscal policy failures: Hockey told reporters: The Reserve Bank is endeavouring to do the heavy lifting on the economy that the government is failing to do We now have a budget in chaos, we have got a government in chaos, but we have got a Reserve Bank that is prepared to step up to the mark and try to provide some economic leadership. Meanwhile the Australian dollar fell to a two-month low against the US dollar. German factory orders in March have smashed forecasts , jumping by 2.2% last month compared with February. Economists had expected a 0.5% drop, as Germany felt the impact of the eurozone recession. But the sector actually saw a rise in exports (+2.7%), driven by demand from other euro countries (+4.2%). Domestic orders were up 1.8% during March. Rainer Sartoris of HSBC Trinkaus told Reuters that the figures should calm fears that Germany's economy shrank in the last quarter: The recovery is on its way. We have had two consecutive strong increases now. In the City, Steve Collins, global head of dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management, agreed that the figures were a fillip for Germany: The Netherlands is looking enviously at France's two-year extension to its deficit targets. Finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters this morning that he'd like a one-year extension (reports Matina Stevis of the Wall Street Journal): Last week the EC predicted that the Netherlands deficit would breach the 3% target, at 3.6% of GDP both this year and in 2014. That suggests that the Netherlands must either make further cutbacks, or be allowed to miss the target (or simply breach it without 'permission'). A one-year extension would give the Netherlands until 2014 to trim its annual government borrowing below 3% of GDP. France's finance minister has declared that Europe has turned a corner in its approach to austerity, during a high-profile visit to Germany today. Pierre Moscovici welcomed the news that the EU would grant the French government two more years to get its deficit in line, claiming it was a sign of a shift away from fiscal cutbacks in favour of growth. Moscovici said Europe was now moving towards a \"doctrine of positive deficit reduction,\" where economic recovery was the main priority. He insisted that France had not given up on controlling its debts -- even those its deficit is forecast to be higher in 2014 (4.2%) than 2013 (3.9%) He was speaking at the 25th meeting of the German French Finance and Economy Council in Berlin this morning. With France sliding into recession, Moscovici insisted it was in Europe's wider interest for the second-largest member of the eurozone to be given until 2015 to hit the EU's target of a 3% deficit. I know that the decision has raised questions in Germany [but] We need a strong France. And Moscovici added that France would continue to implement reforms, saying: France is a serious country conducting a credible policy... Of course, we have to make sure public finances are put right, but you have to carry out this exercise carefully, taking into account the natoinal situations and defining the right rhythm for preserving growth prospects. Despite the growing tensions between Paris and Berlin, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble agreed that the two countries must remain close: Jeroen Dijsselbloem's media team have now tweeted the main points from his appearance of this morning's session on the future European monetary union (see 10.52am): Back in Brussels, eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has been speaking at the Blueprint for a deep and genuine EMU conference (see also 9.38am) On banking union, Dijsselbloem told the conference that European Central Bank should immediately scrutinise the eurozone's banks when it takes responsibility for the sector this summer. He warned that undeclared losses on bad debts meant there was still the risk of contamination between European banks Dijsselbloem also insisted that those with under \u20ac100,000 in the bank must be protected under Europe's rules for failed banks (ironic, given he took the blame for the original (swiftly reversed) decision to impose losses on all Cyprus savers in its bailout). The German stock market just a record high in morning trading, as the DAX gained 47 points to 8160. Other European markets are higher again too. Traders are upbeat after HSBC reported decent results this morning (the bank beat estimates and almost doubled its pre-tax profits). There's also ongoing optimism that central banks will maintain loose monetary policy -- especially following Australia's rate cut (see 8.31am). Weak economic data (such as this morning's poor French industrial output), don't seem to cause much concern. Here's the other mid-morning prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 19 points at 6540, +0.3% \u2022 French CAC: up 12 points at 3919, +0.3% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 52 points at 8556, + 0.6% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 18 points at 17043, + 1% Britain has defied the slowdown in Europe's car sector, with sales up 15% year-on-year in April. That's via the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which has hiked its sales forecast for the year by 3%. It's such a contrast with the rest of Europe, where sales were down 10% in March (we don't have April's data yet). (more on this later) Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso is outling his vision for European Monetary Union now, at a conference on the EC's \"Blueprint for a deep and genuine EMU\" You can watch the speech here. Barroso said \"the world has moved on\" since economic and monetary union was set up, and talked about the implications of not pushing for closer polital union at the same time. He claimed the crisis was caused by \"broken rules\" rather than genuinely bad institutions, and argued that the Cyprus bailout would have been less traumatic if banking union had been in place. Barroso doesn't appear to outline a fresh vision for the eurozone, saying: We don't have the intention or insolence to think we have all the answers. and also stated: Europe will be open and democratic, or it will fail. Here's some more highlights, via the press pack: The most interesting event today could be the meeting between the French and German finance ministers, to discuss how the two countries can address Europe's financial crisis. Pierre Moscovici and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble are meeting in Berlin today, with a press conference due around lunchtime. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated in recent weeks, with France's ruling Socialist party criticising Angela Merkel for her \u201cselfish intransigence\", so it could be a tasty event. Over the weekend Moscovici declared that the \"dogma of austerity' was over, so his views on deficit reduction targets should be interesting too. Other European leaders are also in action today. Here's an agenda, via RanSquawk: \u2022 Moscovici and Sch\u00e4uble hold press conference: 12.30pm BST \u2022 Olli Rehn and Jeroen Dijsselbloem at conference in Brussels: this morning \u2022 Angela Merkel speaking in Rostock: 14.40pm BST \u2022 Jeroen Dijsselbloem meeting Christine Lagarde at the Hague: 1pm BST Gloomy economic news from France this morning - industrial output fell by a worse-than-expected 0.9% in March. The fall was driven by lower production in France's farm and transport sectors, alongside a fall in oil refining, and won't ease fears that Europe's second largest economy is enduring a tough 2013. Reuters has more details:: The monthly fall, in part an adjustment from a 0.8% rebound in February driven by the restarting of a refinery, was worse than the 0.3% dip predicted by economists in a Reuters poll. Output over the first quarter in the moribund industrial sector -- which makes up about 12% of France's economy -- was down 0.4% compared with the previous quarter. President Francois Hollande is struggling, a year into his term, to fulfil a campaign pledge to pull the industrial sector out of a long slump that is driving a steady stream of layoffs. His government said this week that measures taken so far to boost competitiveness would take time to bear fruit. Manufacturing output, a measure that excludes water, energy and mining, was down 1.0% in March after a 0.8% rise the previous month, the data from the INSEE statistics office showed. There was slightly better news for France in its monthly trade data - the deficit narrowed to \u20ac4.696bn in March, from \u20ac5.645bn in February. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone and across the global economy. Overnight, the Reserve Bank of Australia has become the latest central bank to react to fears of an economic slowdown by cutting interest rates to a record low. BoA surprised most economists by slashing borrowing costs by a quarter-point, to 2.75%. It cited China's recent slowdown and the ongoing Eurozone recession as reasons to ease monetary policy now. In a statement, governor Glenn Stevens explained: The global economy is likely to record growth a little below trend this year, before picking up next year. Among the major regions, the United States continues on a path of moderate expansion and China's growth is running at a more sustainable, but still robust, pace. Japan has announced significant new policy initiatives aimed at strengthening demand and ending deflation. The euro area remains in recession. Commodity prices have moderated a little in recent months though they remain high by historical standards. Australia had been booming last year, thanks in part to strong demand for its commodities from China's factories. But the drop in Chinese GDP growth has had a knock-on effect. As Stevens explained, economic growth in Australia appeared to be 'a little below trend' this year, while unemployment was inching higher - to a new three-year high of 5.6%. But the country is still in relatively decent shape, though. The IMF expects the Australian economy to grow by 3% this year, rising to 3.3% in 2014. And its jobless rate is still just half that of the European Union. The move comes just a few days after the European Central Bank cut eurozone borrowing costs to a new record low of just 0.5%. In the UK, the Bank of England meets tomorrow for its monthly meeting - to again ponder whether another dose of quantitative easing, or even a rate cut, is needed. Australia's move helped to sent the Japanese stock market up to its highest level since 2008, with the Nikkei rallying by 3.6%. It was the first day's trading in Tokyo since last Thursday, before the ECB rate cut and surprisingly strong US jobs data on Friday. As usual, I'll be tracking events through the eurozone and beyond through day (and catching up with key developments yesterday, when we were off-duty for the UK bank holiday)....",

      "bodyText": "Influential investment adviser Glass Lewis has called for JP Morgan to appoint an independent chairman and for shareholders to vote out directors who oversaw the bank's \"London whale\" losses. The move will put further pressure on Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive, ahead of the bank's annual shareholder meeting later this month. Shareholders have already been advised to vote for an independent chairman by Glass Lewis's main rival, Institutional Shareholder Services. The two firms advise many of JP Morgan's largest shareholders. Glass Lewis and ISS have advised shareholders to vote against three members of the board's risk committee \u2013 David Cote, Ellen Futter and chairman James Crown \u2013 for what they allege are failures of oversight. Glass Lewis also added three members of the firm's audit committee to its hit list \u2013 James Bell, Crandall Bowles and chairman Laban Jackson Jr. Calling for the directors to be ousted, Glass Lewis cited their alleged role in JP Morgan's $6bn (\u00a33.9bn) London trading losses: \"Shareholders should be concerned that company management was allowed to build a massive exposure to credit derivatives, switch VaR [value at risk] models following a breach of risk limits, and value its positions so to minimize losses, and that it was able to do each of these things without triggering a board-level review or a mandatory containment of risk.\" The bank has been lobbying shareholders ahead of the meeting on 21 May. It has the support of another proxy adviser, Egan-Jones Proxy Services, and the backing of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. \"I'm 100% for Jamie,\" Buffett told Bloomberg Television last week. \"I couldn't think of a better chairman.\" Three of the bank's largest shareholders \u2013 Blackrock, Vanguard and Fidelity \u2013 are reportedly still undecided about how they will vote. The three hold 12% of JP Morgan shares and last year backed Dimon in a similar vote over his chairmanship.",

      "body": "<p>Online gaming group <strong>Betfair</strong> has issued an upbeat trading statement in an attempt to fend off an unwanted \u00a3920m bid from private equity group CVC Capital Partners.</p> <p>Its shares added 16.5p to 861.5p. This is still below the 880p on offer from CVC, although some nonetheless believe the price will have to be raised to win the day.</p> <p>Betfair said full year estimated earnings were likely to come in at around \u00a373m, at the top end of its previous forecasts. Revenues had reached around \u00a3387m while it had \u00a3168m of cash on the balance sheet. It reported record new UK customers, and cut 500 staff as part of a restructuring.</p> <p>Cost savings have been raised from \u00a320m to \u00a330m. But there was no mention of any cash return to investors, which some had been expecting.</p> <p>Chief executive Breon Corcoran said the company's new management team had successfully completed the shake-up ahead of schedule, and its new sportsbook was doing well in combination with its existing exchange business. Having bought Blue Square it is planning further targeted acquisitions. In a buy note Simon French at Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> The key thrust on strategy is that early indications are that the exchange and sportsbook products are more complimentary than originally envisaged and that \"Exchange plus Sportsbook\" can deliver a sustainable competitive advantage. <br> Some investors may be disappointed there is no commitment to return cash to shareholders but the group is looking to accelerate growth through international opportunities and balance sheet flexibility. [We] reiterate our buy recommendation and 1000p target price. </blockquote> <p>Nick Batram at Peel Hunt kept his hold recommendation but also welcomed the update:</p> <blockquote> As an initial defence, beating expectations and raising cost savings shouldn't really surprise anyone, but it is nonetheless a good start for Betfair's management. <br> There are three key positives from today's announcement that suggest to us that CVC will have to significantly up its bid if it wants to secure Betfair. Firstly, while it is early days, the increased focus on the UK appears to be delivering strong customer acquisition numbers. Secondly, what might have been a back-foot defence now firmly looks like a business being positioned on the front foot.

      "bodyText": "Online gaming group Betfair has issued an upbeat trading statement in an attempt to fend off an unwanted \u00a3920m bid from private equity group CVC Capital Partners. Its shares added 16.5p to 861.5p. This is still below the 880p on offer from CVC, although some nonetheless believe the price will have to be raised to win the day. Betfair said full year estimated earnings were likely to come in at around \u00a373m, at the top end of its previous forecasts. Revenues had reached around \u00a3387m while it had \u00a3168m of cash on the balance sheet. It reported record new UK customers, and cut 500 staff as part of a restructuring. Cost savings have been raised from \u00a320m to \u00a330m. But there was no mention of any cash return to investors, which some had been expecting. Chief executive Breon Corcoran said the company's new management team had successfully completed the shake-up ahead of schedule, and its new sportsbook was doing well in combination with its existing exchange business. Having bought Blue Square it is planning further targeted acquisitions. In a buy note Simon French at Panmure Gordon said: The key thrust on strategy is that early indications are that the exchange and sportsbook products are more complimentary than originally envisaged and that \"Exchange plus Sportsbook\" can deliver a sustainable competitive advantage. Some investors may be disappointed there is no commitment to return cash to shareholders but the group is looking to accelerate growth through international opportunities and balance sheet flexibility. [We] reiterate our buy recommendation and 1000p target price. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt kept his hold recommendation but also welcomed the update: As an initial defence, beating expectations and raising cost savings shouldn't really surprise anyone, but it is nonetheless a good start for Betfair's management. There are three key positives from today's announcement that suggest to us that CVC will have to significantly up its bid if it wants to secure Betfair. Firstly, while it is early days, the increased focus on the UK appears to be delivering strong customer acquisition numbers. Secondly, what might have been a back-foot defence now firmly looks like a business being positioned on the front foot. Finally, we are glad to see that returning cash to shareholders is not an option at this stage. In a rapidly evolving market and with the strategic opportunities open to Betfair, we believe the cash is better off being deployed in growing the company.",
