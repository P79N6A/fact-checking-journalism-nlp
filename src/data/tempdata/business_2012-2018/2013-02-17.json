He thought he could launch a similar enterprise in London with the help of famous non-executive directors, including Renwick, Horn-Smith and former oil executive Sir Graham Hearne, plus Credit Suisse as adviser. He was right. His father, Jacob Rothschild, a highly successful investor, chipped in for a small stake and the rest of the money followed from the likes of Schroders, BlackRock and the Abu Dhabi Investment Council. With \u00a3707m in the bank, Vallar was in business.</p> <p>JP Morgan Cazenove suggested the acquisition itself. The blue-chip broker had advised Bumi Resources, Indonesia's largest coal miner \u2013 controlled by the Bakries \u2013 and Berau, its fifth largest. Vallar agreed to take a 25% stake in the former and 75% in the latter.

Would Bumi Resources' towering debts and Bakries' reputation in Indonesia for controversy prove a turn-off? It wouldn't matter. Under the rules of Vallar's formation, shareholders didn't get a vote. Speed of execution was deemed more important and the approval of the Vallar board was final.</p> <p>On completion, another unusual feature was triggered. Rothschild and his associates were able to convert their \"B\" shares into a stake of 6.7% in Vallar \u2013 in effect, a bonus for getting the company up and running. Rothschild became co-chairman alongside Indra Bakrie, younger brother of Indonesian presidential hopeful Aburizal. Confidence was high. Rothschild spoke about investors in Vallar, renamed Bumi after the deal, securing a return of \"two or three times their money\".

      "body": "<p>Senior bankers at Royal Bank of Scotland are in line to share a multimillion-pound bonus windfall, in a move that risks stoking another pay row at the bailed-out bank in the wake of the \u00a3390m Libor fine.</p> <p>The five staff in question are members of a core management team selected by Stephen Hester, the RBS chief executive, who is facing criticism for the \u00a3780,000 share award he is due to receive from his 2010 bonus next month.</p> <p>The fresh round of share awards \u2013 which could be worth as much as \u00a36m if they pay out in full \u2013 are the product of long-term incentive plans put in place in 2010 and which run for three years, ending on 14 May this year. The incentive plans are one of three components of pay for senior executives, on top of their salaries and annual bonus awards.</p> <p>Decisions are yet to be made on the precise number of shares that will be released to members of Hester's management committee and <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/royal-bk-scot.grp.-(rbs)/rns/directorpdmr-shareholding/201005141616199815L/\" title=\"\">little information</a> has been provided about the performance criteria attached to them.</p> <p>The criteria attached to share awards made at the same time in 2010 to Hester and the RBS finance director, Bruce van Saun, indicate that they will miss out on share awards worth \u00a33m and \u00a31.8m respectively because the bank's share price and financial performance have fallen short of the required levels.</p> <p>If the bonuses to the five other RBS bankers were to pay out in full, the executive who runs the US arm of RBS, Ellen Alemany, could be in line for approximately \u00a32.1m from the release of two awards of shares. Nathan Bostock, who runs the non-core assets of RBS, stands to receive shares worth \u00a31.2m, while Paul Geddes, who now runs the Direct Line insurance subsidiary, could receive stock worth \u00a3800,000. Chris Sullivan, the head of business banking, would be awarded shares worth up to \u00a3900,000, and the senior banker Ron Teerlink would receive stock valued at \u00a31m. According to disclosures on the London Stock Exchange, the shares will pay out against \"financial and operational performance\" and \"effective\" risk management. However, they are unlikely to pay out in full. The bank is clawing back bonuses amounting to \u00a3300m to pay the part of the \u00a3390m Libor fine that is payable to US regulators.</p> <p>The bank's chairman, Philip Hampton, has made clear that Hester's annual bonus for 2010 will not be included in that clawback. Hester was handed \u00a32m in shares in 2010 and part of that will pay out next month in shares worth \u00a3780,000.</p> <p>Last week Hampton defended Hester's pay, telling parliamentarians on the banking standards commission that it was \"relatively modest\". He said the chief executive was paid \"well below the market rate of people working in banking\" because his bonuses had not paid out.</p> <p>Hester also defended his pay to the commission, saying the nation was now \"off the hook\" for a lot of \"bad things\" of the past. \"My bonus should be assessed on all the things I do well and badly, and judgment should be reached in the round,\" he said.</p> <p>While Hester looks likely to keep his annual bonus for 2010 \u2013 the only one he has received since joining after the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout \u2013 the award of the equivalent of about 85,000 shares under the incentive plan in 2010 looks likely to lapse. Those shares were due to be released on 14 May this year. They are worth \u00a33m at Friday's share price of \u00a33.50. The release is linked to a review of the bank's risk, financial targets and share price targets.

      "bodyText": "Senior bankers at Royal Bank of Scotland are in line to share a multimillion-pound bonus windfall, in a move that risks stoking another pay row at the bailed-out bank in the wake of the \u00a3390m Libor fine. The five staff in question are members of a core management team selected by Stephen Hester, the RBS chief executive, who is facing criticism for the \u00a3780,000 share award he is due to receive from his 2010 bonus next month. The fresh round of share awards \u2013 which could be worth as much as \u00a36m if they pay out in full \u2013 are the product of long-term incentive plans put in place in 2010 and which run for three years, ending on 14 May this year. The incentive plans are one of three components of pay for senior executives, on top of their salaries and annual bonus awards. Decisions are yet to be made on the precise number of shares that will be released to members of Hester's management committee and little information has been provided about the performance criteria attached to them. The criteria attached to share awards made at the same time in 2010 to Hester and the RBS finance director, Bruce van Saun, indicate that they will miss out on share awards worth \u00a33m and \u00a31.8m respectively because the bank's share price and financial performance have fallen short of the required levels. If the bonuses to the five other RBS bankers were to pay out in full, the executive who runs the US arm of RBS, Ellen Alemany, could be in line for approximately \u00a32.1m from the release of two awards of shares. Nathan Bostock, who runs the non-core assets of RBS, stands to receive shares worth \u00a31.2m, while Paul Geddes, who now runs the Direct Line insurance subsidiary, could receive stock worth \u00a3800,000. Chris Sullivan, the head of business banking, would be awarded shares worth up to \u00a3900,000, and the senior banker Ron Teerlink would receive stock valued at \u00a31m. According to disclosures on the London Stock Exchange, the shares will pay out against \"financial and operational performance\" and \"effective\" risk management. However, they are unlikely to pay out in full. The bank is clawing back bonuses amounting to \u00a3300m to pay the part of the \u00a3390m Libor fine that is payable to US regulators. The bank's chairman, Philip Hampton, has made clear that Hester's annual bonus for 2010 will not be included in that clawback. Hester was handed \u00a32m in shares in 2010 and part of that will pay out next month in shares worth \u00a3780,000. Last week Hampton defended Hester's pay, telling parliamentarians on the banking standards commission that it was \"relatively modest\". He said the chief executive was paid \"well below the market rate of people working in banking\" because his bonuses had not paid out. Hester also defended his pay to the commission, saying the nation was now \"off the hook\" for a lot of \"bad things\" of the past. \"My bonus should be assessed on all the things I do well and badly, and judgment should be reached in the round,\" he said. While Hester looks likely to keep his annual bonus for 2010 \u2013 the only one he has received since joining after the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout \u2013 the award of the equivalent of about 85,000 shares under the incentive plan in 2010 looks likely to lapse. Those shares were due to be released on 14 May this year. They are worth \u00a33m at Friday's share price of \u00a33.50. The release is linked to a review of the bank's risk, financial targets and share price targets. In order to pay out in full the plan requires the share price to be more than \u00a37.50. The actual amounts released to the five members of Hester's top team will be decided in the coming weeks and their value will depend on the prevailing share price, in May. Hester waived his bonuses for 2012 after an IT meltdown in June, and next month the bank's annual report will provide more detail about pay policies for last year. It is not yet know whether his counterpart at bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group, Antonio Horta-Osorio, will receive a bonus for 2012. His award could be linked to the share price breaking 74p, the price at which the taxpayer breaks even on its 40% stake. The potential RBS payouts come amid fresh speculation about the government's plans to extricate itself from its 82% stake in the bank, which is worth \u00a313bn less than the taxpayer paid for it. The chancellor, George Osborne, has played down reports that he plans to give RBS shares worth up to \u00a3400 to every voter or taxpayer before the next general election.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A restaurant hailed by David Cameron as a \"proud example\" of \"big society\" in action has been forced to close as a result of the economic squeeze. For a few heady months, Create restaurant lived out a northern version of Jamie Oliver's social enterprise dream. It hired a star chef and offered great, reasonably priced cuisine that was f\u00eated by critics: thinly sliced venison, partridge breast and saut\u00e9ed girolles, all cooked and served up by a team partly made up of homeless trainees. The restaurant's idealistic slogan was \"Where good food and people matter\". The Good Food Guide praised the ethos, and comments from Downing Street were glowing. Last weekend, however, just months after it won Observer Food Monthly's ethical restaurant of the year award, the dream came to an end. Create was forced to close after facing what it called \"tough commercial realities\". Its rapid rise and precipitous fall \u2013 in five years it grew from a sandwich-making venture in a Leeds night shelter for the homeless to a business with a turnover of more than \u00a31m and branches across the north of England \u2013 is seen exemplifying the struggle faced by social enterprises: ethically driven firms that reinvest profits in a \"social mission\". Create said that despite winning plaudits for its food and achieving huge success in training disadvantaged youngsters \u2013 nearly two thirds of the 500 homeless trainees who passed through its kitchens not only found work elsewhere, but were still in a job six months after \"graduation\" \u2013 it had struggled financially. Attempts to widen its income by tapping into government welfare-to-work business had failed, despite its expertise and record. Chairman Norman Pickavance said its small size meant that it was effectively excluded from competing for contracts in the Work Programme, which is dominated by big firms. Pickavance, a former director of Morrisons supermarkets, said: \"We set out with high ideals. We were going to do this [train disadvantaged youngsters] by making money out of the restaurant. But the maths don't work. In these tough times, selling food is not enough.\" Peter Holbrook, the chief executive of Social Enterprise UK, said that Create's difficulties were shared by many smaller social businesses, especially those squeezed out of \"toxic\" public sector markets such as the Work Programme. He warned: \"We are going to lose a lot of innovation, a lot of organisations embedded in communities that achieve outstanding results for local people.\" The government has insisted that it wants to support social enterprises by opening public-sector markets. Cameron called Create \"a proud example of the 'big society' I want to see across the UK\", and made it the second ever winner of the No 10 \"big society\" award in November 2010. Pickavance said that Create had been filled with optimism after winning the award and meeting ministers. \"You think, 'Wow, this has really taken off.' But it is all rhetoric and no money.\" Create's last set of accounts filed at Companies House show losses of nearly \u00a31m in 2011, partly as a result of opening new branches. Create board member and the millionaire businessman Ged Syddall, who made a fortune from government apprenticeship schemes, wrote off \u00a3900,000 in loans to try to keep Create afloat. Create says the closure is temporary while it carries out a restructuring, led by its chef, the former Harvey Nichols head chef Richard Allen. The new business model is expected to concentrate more on training and less on food. In a statement, Create said: \"Throughout this journey our passion has remained the same, helping the hardest-to-reach people in our community, and with your support we have managed to support over 500 people. However we are not a charity. As a social enterprise we pay the same rents as any other restaurant chain but have had higher costs because of the extra support work we do. \"So in today's harsh economy we have had to look really hard at how we can continue helping the maximum number of people while dealing with some tough commercial realities.\" A year ago the Observer's food critic, Jay Rayner, gave Create a glowing review, citing \"one of the best-cooked hunks of skirt steak I have ever enjoyed\". He concluded: \"It says much for the success of this place that by the end of lunch even this cynical old dog was ready to clamber on to his hind legs and applaud.\" But the first outward signs of trouble surfaced in November, when Create warned that the business was \"on a knife edge\" after suffering cashflow problems. It closed operations in Manchester and Sunderland, and made 16 staff redundant. Create's difficulties follow the demise of another high-profile social enterprise training restaurant, the Hoxton Apprentice, which went into administration at the end of last year. Even Fifteen, which benefited from the public exposure of a TV series and the celebrity patronage of Jamie Oliver, has said that the cost of training disadvantaged youngsters \u2013 at around \u00a330,000 a head \u2013 makes it hard to compete in the cut-throat world of restaurants and catering.",

      "bodyText": "Do you grudgingly accept there is no fundamental alternative to how things are, hard times and difficult choices? Then come to Goodland. You might want to live here. Its president refuses the state mansion. He gives away 90% of his pay, living on the national average wage to share in the struggles of his people. Goodland has a new constitution, written by citizens. When its financial sector fell apart, speculators had to take their losses and the guilty were taken to court, not given a public bailout. The country has a dynamic, largely mutually owned, local banking system. It avoids bad risk and bends over backwards to help small businesses. In Goodland, human wellbeing is more important than economic growth. There is a national plan for good living, free health and education services, subsidised childcare allowing for a more equal workplace, and support for the elderly. It has a law enshrining protection of its life-supporting ecosystems that stands above all other laws. Goodland's cities are green and grow healthy, organic food for the inhabitants. A phase-out of most fossil fuels is planned by 2017, and its business sector has large, intelligently connected and productive cooperatives. A shorter working week is available by choice. Utter fantasy? No. Goodland exists. It is just a little, well, spread out. Each aspect can be enjoyed in the real world, just not all in the same place. It's like fantasy football, where you build your perfect team from all known players, but better. Fantasy economics is not limited by the supply of players, but rather grows from emulating best practices wherever you find them. The president mentioned above is Jos\u00e9 Mujica of Uruguay. He lives on about \u00a3450 per month. His presidential guard is two policemen and a three-legged dog. He drives a 1987 VW Beetle and criticises the rich countries' development model, berating other world leaders' \"blind obsession to achieve growth with consumption\". After financial meltdown in Iceland, the \"pots and pans\" revolution led to a new citizen-drafted constitution, adoption pending, that actively engaged half the electorate. Rather than making the public pay for the crisis, as Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman points out, Iceland also \"let the banks go bust\" and, instead of placating financial markets, \"imposed temporary controls on the movement of capital to give itself room to manoeuvre\". In Porto Alegre in Brazil, since 1990, citizens meet every week to decide how a big portion of the city's public purse gets spent. It's called participatory budgeting and in seven years led to doubling access to proper sanitation in poor neighbourhoods. One reason Germany was less hit by the bank crisis is because 70% of the sector is in small or community banks. By comparison, in the UK the big five banks hold 80% of mortgages and 90% of small and medium enterprise accounts. The German banks have a dual mandate, having to be useful as well as profitable. They're also mostly mutually owned, don't indulge in risky speculation, have local knowledge, branch autonomy and decision making. In Spain, the multi-headed \u20ac14bn Mondrag\u00f3n cooperative, with over 80,000 employees, demonstrates that less self-interested company ownership models can succeed at scale. And the successful uptake by the Dutch of a shorter working week suggests we aren't condemned to work ourselves to death, whatever the coalition says. Bhutan famously measures its success not by using GDP \u2013 simply a measure of the amount, not quality, of economic activity \u2013 but by assessing Gross National Happiness. This broad, composite indicator uses 151 variables including: good governance, education, health, ecological resilience, community vitality, wellbeing, time use, living standards and cultural diversity. After the UN General Assembly adopted 22 April as Mother Earth Day, Bolivia adopted its Mother Earth Law in 2010. The law requires all current and future legislation to accept the \"ecological limits set by nature\". In practice, it means pushing a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and environmentally auditing companies. Elsewhere, Nicaragua committed to a near-complete phase-out of fossil fuels by 2017, while Cuba's organic, urban farming movement has greened cities and boosted public health. In Ecuador, there is an overarching National Plan for Good Living that rejects \"most orthodox approaches to development\". It embodies what it calls five revolutions: constitutional and democratic; ethical; economic and agrarian; social; and \"in defence of Latin American dignity\". The aim is to reassert a country's sovereign authority to put its own social and economic objectives above that of the markets. As Britain agonises about the affordability of services, Denmark's tax system pays for free health and education, home help for the elderly, and about three-quarters of the cost of childcare. Far from harming the economy, higher taxes stimulate investment in infrastructure, education and R&amp;D. To suggest Britain has no economic alternatives to its current chosen path is a self-serving political deception. Only our will and imagination restrain us. Here is one, possible, Goodland.

      "bodyText": "It's the largest of its kind in Europe with a lofty glass ceiling and ornate halls. When Leeds's Kirkgate indoor market opened its doors in 1857, its stunning building marked a new era of shopping and became the launch pad for Marks &amp; Spencer. Next month, Leeds is aiming to polish up its retail crown again. Its new glass-domed cathedral to shopping is Trinity Leeds, a \u00a3350m development in the heart of the city centre. It will be the only new major shopping centre to open in the UK this year and the first since Westfield opened its Stratford site in 2011. Yet the ambitious project seems almost as anachronistic as its near neighbour Kirkgate. The 1m sq ft edifice will open its doors on 21 March while the UK struggles on under an economic cloud that has seen the closure of a string of big chains including Woolworths, Borders, HMV and Peacocks. And with shoppers increasingly happy to buy online, does Britain need more shops? Trinity Leeds's developer, Land Securities, believes it is creating the future of British retail. Despite the downturn, it has already leased 90% of the centre by value and more than 80% by floorspace. Builders are putting the finishing touches to large stores for Primark, Next, M&amp;S and Topshop in a city that has reinvented itself as a thriving financial hub. \"We have tried to take shopping forward in the UK,\" says Andrew Dudley, who is overseeing the development for Land Securities. \"Experience is everything. You really need to excite people about coming into towns and cities.\" With that in mind, Trinity Leeds will attempt to tie itself into the digital world with screens that can interact and play games with passersby. There will be free Wi-Fi throughout the centre and other screens will flash up local news and, potentially, live coverage of nearby music and arts events. There's a customer service centre, where shoppers can leave bags while they go to the cinema or pick up items they've ordered online. \"Retail is not just about shopping. It's about taking the best from online, the high street and events venues and bringing it into one place,\" says Paul Smith, marketing manager for Trinity Leeds. He says the centre is also hoping to work with local arts festivals and Leeds Arena, a 13,500-seater venue set to open this year, to put on taster gigs and events that will draw the crowds. It's all part of a strategy to revive Trinity Leeds dreamt up by Land Securities after it called an 18-month halt to building works at the height of the recession in 2009. It has tried to create an entire leisure complex, with the first Everyman cinema outside London and a much larger range of restaurants than a traditional shopping centre. More than 20% of the trading space will be taken up by food and drink outlets. What's notable at a time when there are serious concerns about the future of Britain's high streets is that Trinity nestles into Leeds's existing centre. Its entrances, which lead out onto streets including Briggate, one of the UK's 10 busiest high streets, are gated, not sealed, so that it flows into its surroundings. M&amp;S and Topshop have extended existing stores into the centre, putting them alongside international brands new to the city including Victoria's Secret, Hollister, Apple and Mango. Leeds is reflecting the trend set in the last spree of shopping centre openings in 2008, when 8m sq ft of retail space opened in Liverpool One, Bristol's Cabot Circus and Cardiff's St David's Centre. All bring the big modern stores retailers now want close to the heart of city centres. The next major projects on the horizon, Birmingham's redevelopment of New Street station and the Eastgate centre in Leeds, will follow suit. There hasn't been a major out-of-town shopping centre built for more than a decade in this country. That's partly the result of changes to planning law under which councils must prioritise town centres, but it may also reflect changing habits. The major grocers are already having second thoughts about their once mighty edge-of-town hypermarkets, which are proving less popular with shoppers not keen to spend money on expensive petrol. People want to buy their groceries closer to home in cosier stores that don't tempt them to overspend. Could out-of-town malls also be at risk? \"With an ageing population, having local shops is going to become more important,\" says Maureen Hinton, director of research at retail analyst Verdict. \"Older people want easy access.\" She sees Trinity Leeds as a potential signpost to that future, although its lack of an adjoining car park may prove a drawback given the trend towards ordering bulky goods online to pick up later. They may be close to high streets, but central shopping centres can have as damaging an impact on their surroundings as the old out-of-town parks. Bristol, Cardiff and Liverpool all saw empty shops appear in previously busy nearby streets as major retailers migrated into their new shopping centres. \"If the new centre doesn't lift footfall significantly then it probably just cannibalises from other places in the city,\" says Jamie Veitch from campaign group Action for Market Towns. Trinity Leeds, for example, is drawing in Next, Urban Outfitters and others, potentially leaving their nearby stores vacant. That's not good news for a city that already has more than 20% of its stores empty, according to the Local Data Company. Lola Wilson of the blog Leeds Love Affair says: \"I think the city is split over Trinity Leeds. It's been very sympathetically designed but the concern is that it will drag brands out from the now-full shopping streets. Independents have done incredibly well \u2026 during the downturn and that's what gives Leeds its character. Trinity hasn't really included independents and I'm not convinced it adds any personality to Leeds. Is it really attractive to say, 'come over to our city and go to a slightly larger Primark'?\" The stalls at Kirkgate market are already struggling to survive. Next door at the Corn Exchange, another stunning 19th-century building which was transformed into a shopping arcade in 1990, many shops lie empty. With the total amount being spent in Britain's shops not likely to rise over the next few years, Trinity may well just suck up trade from such neighbours and draw shoppers from nearby towns and cities like Bradford, Castleford and Doncaster, which are already struggling. But shoppers and local retailers express relief that Trinity has appeared. The alternative is on view in Bradford, which has an ugly hole in the city centre where developer Westfield mothballed its Broadway development in 2008. That vast empty space is not a retail future any city wants to contemplate.",
