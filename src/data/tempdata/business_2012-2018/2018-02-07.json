      "bodyText": "Former executives of Carillion have been accused by one of the defunct construction firm\u2019s largest customers of giving misleading evidence to a parliamentary inquiry this week. The comments came after seven former directors, including the one-time chief executive Richard Howson, were branded as \u201cdelusional characters\u201d on Tuesday by MPs, who said the managers were willing to blame everyone but themselves for the contractor\u2019s failure. Appearing at a joint session of the business and work and pensions select committees, Howson pointed to a \u00a3200m bill owed to Carillion by Qatar, which he said remained unpaid for 18 months. The project was to redevelop parts of Qatar\u2019s capital city, Doha, to prepare it for the 2022 World Cup. Howson said he repeatedly tried to extract payment during monthly visits to the country, adding: \u201cI felt like a bailiff.\u201d However, the client, Msheireb Properties, said the company \u201cdisputes the claims made by Carillion executives during the House of Commons select committee\u201d. A spokesman added: \u201cDespite ongoing project delay, Msheireb Properties continued to pay Carillion; however, Carillion did not pass these funds on to its supply chain, leaving over 40 subcontractors unpaid. \u201cThis resulted in Msheireb Properties absorbing significant additional costs as we were forced to pay Carillion\u2019s supply chain directly and engage a third-party contractor to ensure that Carillion\u2019s original project was delivered.\u201d Howson could not be contacted for additional comment on Wednesday. However, one former Carillion source said that the Qatar contract was a commercial dispute, with both sides arguing they were owed money by the other. The latest twist in the saga came as the liaison select committee, which is made up of the chairs of the Commons select committees, also took evidence on the government\u2019s response to the firm\u2019s collapse. The Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, along with John Manzoni, the chief executive of the civil service, and Gareth Rhys Williams, the government\u2019s chief commercial officer, said that the official receiver had been granted \u00a3150m of public funds in order to run the Carillion liquidation. Private lenders had also made around \u00a31bn available to assist subcontractors struggling to cope with the fallout. Lidington said: \u201cThe banks have put together about \u00a31bn of support in the form of loans, credit and other financial support to affected businesses, and HMRC is giving affected businesses a grace period, rather than expecting them to pay immediate tax bills.\u201d Manzoni added that the final cost to the taxpayer could be more or less than the \u00a3150m, depending on how much the receiver managed to claw back from selling on Carillion\u2019s contracts. It has also emerged that not a single minister or official from the Department for Transport met with Carillion, or its subsidiaries, in the year before its collapse. This was despite the firm being awarded four major government contracts worth almost \u00a31.5bn, including two to start construction of stretches of the HS2 high-speed rail line. In a written answer to a Labour parliamentary question, the transport minister Nusrat Ghani confirmed there had been no meetings since January 2017. She said: \u201cThe department\u2019s interaction with Carillion is primarily through its arm\u2019s length bodies.\u201d Jon Trickett, Labour\u2019s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: \u201cFar from falling asleep on the job, Chris Grayling\u2019s department clearly went into full-blown hibernation. \u201cThey need to wake up and explain to the public how they could have possibly awarded a contract the size and significance of HS2, without so much as a meeting with Carillion.\u201d The two biggest contracts, for HS2, were announced in July 2017, exactly a week after Carillion\u2019s first profit warning.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cOne company has got it very, very wrong. Everybody in the industry is as peed off with this Persimmon thing as the people outside it,\u201d says Steve Morgan of Redrow. He\u2019s one of the few people in the housebuilding game with bragging rights over the Persimmon chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, when it comes to counting personal wealth. Morgan is worth more than \u00a3800m versus Fairburn\u2019s windfall of roughly \u00a3110m. The difference is that Morgan made his fortune over a long career by founding and owning a substantial chunk of Redrow. By contrast, Fairburn and his boardroom colleagues at Persimmon got lucky in that their long-term incentive shares were priced in 2012 at the bottom of a market that was pumped up the following year by the then chancellor, George Osborne, and his \u201chelp to buy\u201d subsidies. Morgan, via his Redrow shareholding, has also been a huge beneficiary of Osborne\u2019s largesse, which he inexplicably failed to mention. But he would be right to argue that Fairburn is in a different boat. Morgan has gained by being an owner, with capital at risk, whereas the Persimmon crew are hired hands. As Morgan says, six years ago Fairburn would probably have jumped at a scheme in which the jackpot was capped at \u00a310m. To be consistent, Morgan should also have taken a pop at Berkeley Homes, whose incentive scheme is about 70% as egregious at Persimmon\u2019s. But he\u2019s also right to worry that the Persimmon affair is \u201cdoing the whole of the industry a complete disservice\u201d. If the government\u2019s review of landbanking results in \u201cuse or lose it\u201d penalties, the housebuilders\u2019 cries of innocence won\u2019t get a hearing. Nor will tears be shed on their behalf. Spoonful of medicine needed Emma Walmsley, GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s chief executive, has been in post for almost a year but she still hasn\u2019t found a cure for shareholders\u2019 worries about the dividend. The share price has drifted from \u00a316.50 last April to a shade under \u00a313, and angst over the long-term safety of the dividend has probably been the main driver. There was nothing wrong with GSK\u2019s actual figures for 2017. Ignoring currency effects, full-year operating profits improved 5% to \u00a38.57bn, helped by the failure of generic rivals to win clearance to launch copycat versions of GSK\u2019s big asthma drug, Advair. Arrival or non-arrival of generic competition for Advair in 2018 will again heavily influence GSK\u2019s earnings (could be up 4%-7%, might be flat or down 3%, estimates the company) but there is sufficient confidence to commit to a divi of 80p. Fine, but the cover still looks very thin against 2017 earnings of 112p. That is especially so when you remember what\u2019s bubbling beneath the surface. Investors\u2019 original worry was that Walmsley could imperil GSK\u2019s dividend-paying capabilities by paying big money for Pfizer\u2019s Advil-to-ChapStick consumer health business. The group is in the running with Reckitt Benckiser for a deal that could be worth $15bn-plus but, actually, the divi dangers on that front may be overstated. The dividend is more important than big deals, Walmsley suggested, which presumably means the Pfizer purchase will only happen if the divi calculations aren\u2019t thrown out of whack. Instead, the new worry is an investment splurge in the core business of drug research and development. \u201cImproving our pharmaceuticals business remains our main priority,\u201d Walmsley has said consistently without ever putting a number on the sums involved. The big reveal will come in July, which now looms as a critical date in the Walmsley era. As the share price suggests, the market remains to be convinced that GSK can radically improve the productivity of its labs. But the scepticism is odd in one way. For years, investors wanted more focus on pharma, now they\u2019re worrying about the cost. Big mistake Oh dear, president Trump is tweeting about share prices again. \u201cIn the \u2018old days\u2019, when good news was reported, the stock market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the stock market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!\u201d he declared. Actually, the mistake is for presidents to comment on stock markets. Jay Carney, White House spokesman in the Obama administration, explained why in a much better tweet on the day of Wall Street\u2019s big fall. \u201cGood time to recall that in the previous administration, we NEVER boasted about the stock market \u2013 even though the Dow more than doubled on Obama\u2019s watch \u2013 because we knew two things: 1) the stock market is not the economy; and 2) if you claim the rise, you own the fall,\u201d he said. Spot on. If the US economy performs well but the stock market fades, which is quite possible if the US Federal Reserve feels obliged to raise interest rates, Trump will deserve no credit by his own logic. It was a silly game to start with.",

Jay Carney, White House spokesman in the Obama administration, explained why in a much <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JayCarney/status/960601487666708480\">better tweet</a> on the day of Wall Street\u2019s big fall.</p> <p>\u201cGood time to recall that in the previous administration, we NEVER boasted about the stock market \u2013 even though the Dow more than doubled on Obama\u2019s watch \u2013 because we knew two things: 1) the stock market is not the economy; and 2) if you claim the rise, you own the fall,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Spot on. If the US economy performs well but the stock market fades, which is quite possible if the US Federal Reserve feels obliged to raise interest rates, Trump will deserve no credit by his own logic. It was a silly game to start with.</p>",

      "bodyText": "European stock markets have rallied after sharp losses earlier in the week, with London\u2019s leading share index gaining almost 2%. The FTSE 100 index of the most valuable companies listed in London rose 138 points to 7,279 on Wednesday, still well below its all-time closing high of 7,779 on 12 January. In New York, where the market rout began on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average appeared on track for a second day of recovery, up about 381 points at its peak. The Dow also hit an all-time high last month of 26,616. But a late decline as US bond yields moved higher again saw a reversal by the close, and the Dow ended down 19.42 points at 24,893.35. Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at the spread-betting company IG, said the market remained unpredictable, but added: \u201cThe current course of events has mirrored previous market selloffs \u2013 brief panic, steady recovery and then a return to the longer-term rally.\u201d Donald Trump tweeted to admonish investors for the share sell-off on Monday, claiming they had misread positive economic figures. \u201cIn the \u2018old days\u2019, when good news was reported, the stock market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the stock market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!\u201d the US president said The turnaround from a dramatic slump on Monday was supported by Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, who said US interest rates should not rise before the middle of the year. The global run on shares earlier in the week, ahead of the Dow rally on Tuesday, wiped $4tn off stock market values and pushed down oil and base metals prices. It was triggered by fears that central banks would be forced to react to galloping growth across the industrialised world by hiking interest rates, effectively ending the era of cheap borrowing that has underpinned a decade-long recovery. Evans said he expected US GDP to grow steadily by between 2.5% and 2.75% this year, with growth slowing over the next two years as the boost from Trump\u2019s tax cuts wears off. \u201cWith the data I see today, my policy strategy would be to keep policy on hold until midyear or so in order to assess the incoming inflation data. If we get to that point, and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted,\u201d he said. While markets have steadied, investors are still far more nervous than they were just a few days ago. The VIX index, which is called Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d because it measures how much volatility investors expect in the future, is currently at 21, about double where it was two weeks ago. It spiked above 50 early on Tuesday.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of housebuilder Redrow has described a \u00a3110m bonus being paid to the boss of rival Persimmon as \u201cvery, very wrong\u201d. Steve Morgan, the self-made multimillionaire founder of Redrow, said property industry bosses were \u201cpeed off\u201d with the vast amount of money being handed to Persimmon CEO Jeff Fairburn. Politicians, campaigners and City experts have described the vast payout as \u201cobscene\u201d and \u201ccorporate looting\u201d. Morgan, who holds a \u00a3750m stake in Redrow, which he founded in the 70s, said the largesse at York-based Persimmon was \u201cdoing the whole of the industry a complete disservice\u201d. \u201cOne company has got it very, very wrong. Everybody in the industry is as peed off with this Persimmon thing as the people outside it,\u201d Morgan told the Evening Standard. \u201cFor somebody who has not taken a salary for 20 years, it sticks in the craw, being called a greedy housebuilder because of that one company. I\u2019m sick to the teeth of seeing the headlines of greedy housebuilders.\u201d Morgan\u2019s comments came as Redrow announced a 26% jump in half-year pretax profits to \u00a3176m, and rewarded shareholders by increasing its interim dividend by 50% to 9p a share. The dividend increase will pay Morgan, who owns 32.5% of the company, just over \u00a311m. Morgan, who used to own Wolverhampton Wanderers, has a net worth of \u00a3831m according to the Sunday Times rich list. The rich list compiler said Morgan would have been a new entry to the UK\u2019s billionaires club, but has donated \u00a3226m worth of Redrow shares to charity. He also donates his annual salary to his Morgan Foundation charity, which helps disabled or disadvantaged people in north Wales and the north-west of England. The Persimmon bonus scheme is believed to be Britain\u2019s most generous corporate payout ever and will hand more than \u00a3500m to 150 staff this year. Around 80 workers will get more than \u00a31m. Morgan said it would never have happened if he were in charge, as he would have capped the maximum payout. Persimmon\u2019s chairman, Nicholas Wrigley, and remuneration committee chairman, Jonathan Davie, resigned in December after acknowledging that they should have capped the maximum bonus. Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the \u201cscale of this bonus is obscene\u201d and built on a \u201cgovernment subsidy\u201d, as housebuilders\u2019 strong stock market performance has been fuelled by the help-to-buy scheme. Garry White, the chief investment commentator at the stockbroker Charles Stanley, said: \u201cThe size of the [Persimmon] bonuses means management could easily be accused of corporate looting, so shareholders have every right to be unimpressed.\u201d Persimmon\u2019s shareholders, including Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), have called on Fairburn to consider \u201ctaking a voluntary reduction, or donating some of the money\u201d. The majority of shareholders, however, supported the scheme when it was set up. Fairburn has refused to hand back any of his award, saying he deserves the full payment \u2013 which is more than enough to end homelessness in York \u2013 because he \u201cworked very hard\u201d. Fairburn, 51, has refused to state whether he will donate any of the award to charity. \u201cI consider my plans for any charitable giving to be a private matter and I do not wish to comment any further on that,\u201d he said last month. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put this into context of what has been achieved. I do fully accept that the potential payouts under the scheme for top individuals are very significant.\u201d Fairburn has already received part of his payout and will qualify for the remaining \u00a360m worth of bonus shares, which are linked to the firm\u2019s dividend payments, this summer.",

Yields rose after a disappointing bond auction and reports of a new budget deal which would increase current spending caps. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 19.42 points at 24,893.35. After an earlier rise of 381 points this was its biggest turnaround since August 2015. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 ended down 0.5%. On that note we\u2019ll close up until tomorrow. After their declines on Tuesday, European markets have taken their cue from the overnight rise on Wall Street and also the opening optimism in the US. The FTSE 100, which saw its biggest losses since the Brexit vote on Tuesday, has recovered more than half of the decline, and there was a similar picture elsewhere. Signs that Germany was putting its political differences aside also helped sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 138.02 points or 1.93% at 7279.42 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.6% to 12,590.43 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.82% to 5255.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 2.86% better at 22,986.18 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.7% at 9976.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.33% to 849.94 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 132 points or 0.49%, off its best levels after US ten year bond yields rose to a day\u2019s high of 2.828% in the wake of a disappointing auction. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow (unless something major happens before then). Thanks for reading and all your comments. Meanwhile, Greece is mulling pushing ahead with the sale of a seven-year euro benchmark bond - postponed on account of the sell-off - on Thursday, bankers say. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After years of exile, the debt-stricken county is keen to prove it can tap international markets again. The seven-year issue would be its boldest market foray yet, and was formally announced on Monday with trading expected to take place Tuesday. Instead, Greek finance officials took one look at the market rout and thought better of it. But depending on how the US markets perform, trade could begin Thursday bankers are now saying. Greece hopes to raise \u20ac3bn with the issue as part of efforts to build up a \u20ac19bn cash buffer that would allow the country to cover debt repayments independently when its third international bailout programme officially expires in August. Back with cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin is up 4% to $8,050 despite negative comments from Goldman Sachs. Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at payments specialist Centtrip, said: Bitcoin staged a solid recovery today, having previously fallen 70% from its record highs last December. The cryptocurrency briefly dropped below the $6,000 a coin level before gaining almost 40%, and is now back above $8,000 a coin. The rise comes at a time when Goldman...suggested market participants should be ready for cryptocurrencies to hit zero. According to the bank, the fall in cryptocurrencies, which erased nearly $500 billion worth of market value over the last month, could get a lot worse. Nouriel Roubini, an American economist, suggested that bitcoin was \u2018much worse\u2019 than Tulipmania. His comments had zero impact on the recent surge in Bitcoin, suggesting that some of the optimism around cryptocurrencies is still there. A break of $9,500 would signal further gains for the coin, but a longer term move lower is more likely. US interest rates should not rise before the middle of the year, according to Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans. With the recent strong data - notably Friday\u2019s wage growth - analysts have been becoming more convinced a rate rise is on the cards in March, with four rather than three rises in the rest of the year. But speaking at a conference in Iowa, Evans said: With the data I see today, my policy strategy would be to keep policy on hold until midyear or so in order to assess the incoming inflation data. If we get to that point and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted. In contrast, suppose inflation picks up more assuredly, as many expect. Then, we still could easily raise rates another three or even four times in 2018 if that were necessary. And I would support such a faster pace if the data point convincingly in this direction. Evans said he expected US GDP to grow between 2.5% and 2.75% this year, with growth slowing over the next two years as the boost from Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts wears off. As for inflation, he expects it to rise gradually over the next few years: There is a hint that this may be in train today. Some inflation indicators over the past couple of months have been positive. I also am hearing a bit more commentary from manufacturers about higher commodity prices. While wage increases have been disappointingly low, the most recent data exhibit a firming trend. And I\u2019ve recently been hearing from more of my business contacts that firms are raising wages, giving additional bonuses, and boosting benefits. These are all positive signs for wage growth and clear signs of tighter labor markets. In my forecast, I expect inflation to rise gradually to our 2 percent target, perhaps reaching it in late 2019 or in 2020. But despite the indicators I just noted, I have not yet seen many actual increases in consumer prices. So, my forecast of reaching our target is still just a forecast. There is still a role for accommodative monetary policy to bring us back to our 2 percent inflation target. Evans voted against a rate rise in December but is a non-voting member this year, so his comments won\u2019t necessarily hold much sway when it comes to the path of interest rates, although his reasoning is interesting. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The rout in stocks seen in the first two days of the week seems a long way away now, as a classic rebound in sentiment sees the Dow gain over 200 points within the first two hours, while the FTSE 100 continues to claw its way higher. The \u2018cash on the sidelines\u2019 theory gets a lot of stick these days, since who in their right mind would still hold cash when the market kept racing higher, but evidently equity investors (or their passive machine counterparts) have managed to scrimmage behind the sofa for some more funds in order to go bargain hunting in stock markets. While we can\u2019t tell what will happen next, the current course of events has mirrored previous market selloffs \u2013 brief panic, steady recovery and then a return to the longer-term rally. It is, after all, a bull market. The rebound in markets continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 311 points or 1.28%, while the FTSE 100 is 2.26% better, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.8% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.89%. Oil prices have come under pressure amid a rise in US crude stocks and a jump in US production. Opec and Russia have agreed output cuts to try and support crude prices, but there were concerns that US producers would step in to fill any shortfalls as the price rose. Last week the Energy Information Administration reported that US production rose by 332,000 barrels a day to a record high of 10.25m barrels a day. Meanwhile crude inventories rose by 1.9m barrels last week. Brent fell more than 0.8% on the news to $66.18, giving up all the gains made so far this year. The news from the US offset reports that the UK Forties pipeline was shut with no clear indication of when it would re-open. Here\u2019s our story on Donald Trump\u2019s latest comments on the stock market. Dominic Rushe writes: The stock market is making a \u201cbig mistake\u201d, Donald Trump said on Thursday, days after a record-breaking sell-off on the US exchanges. \u201cIn the \u2018old days,\u2019 when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter in his first public comment on the sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,175 points on Monday following another sharp fall last Friday. The drop appears to have been triggered by news of stronger than expected growth in wages which fueled expectations of a sharper rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Commenting on the markets on Tuesday White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the US economy was \u201cincredibly strong\u201d and \u201cnothing that\u2019s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that\u2019s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago\u201d. Since his election Trump US \u2013 and global \u2013 stock markets have hit a series of record highs. Trump has consistently pointed to rising stock markets as proof that his economic policies are working. The full report is here: President Trump\u2019s boasting about the rise in the US stock market came shortly before the crash, and he has been notably silent about it since then. Until now that is: The bounce on Wall Street has given an extra lift to European markets. The FTSE 100 is now up 105 points or 1.5%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has risen 0.9% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.8%. As a sign we\u2019re in for another volatile day, the Dow is now up 97 points. After Tuesday\u2019s rollercoaster ride in US markets which ended with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 567 points and the S&amp;P 500 breaking a four day losing streak, Wall Street is heading lower again. As politicians scramble to put together a two year Budget plan that would prevent another government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down around 111 points but the decline was quickly reduced to just 29 points. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq Composite both opened down 0.32%. Ahead of Wall Street\u2019s open, Federal Reserve voting member William Dudley says he believes \u201cthe markets are functioning quite well.\u201d But he also said: Europe\u2019s economy is expected to show robust growth this year and next after a better than forecast performance in 2017, according to the European Commission. In its latest forecasts the Commission said both the eurozone and the wider EU saw GDP grow by 2.4% last year, better than the 2.2% and 2.3% respectively that it predicted in November. For 2018 the Commission expects a slowdown to 2.3%, although this is higher than the 2.1% it forecast in November. It is forecasting a further decline to 2% in 2019, but again this is higher than the November estimate of 1.9%. It said: This is a result of both stronger cyclical momentum in Europe, where labour markets continue to improve and economic sentiment is particularly high, and a stronger than expected pick-up in global economic activity and trade. On inflation it expected a modest pick-up next year: Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, is expected to stay subdued as labour market slack recedes only slowly and wage pressures remain contained. Headline inflation will continue to reflect the significant influence of energy prices and is forecast to rise modestly. Inflation in the euro area reached 1.5% in 2017. It is forecast to remain at 1.5% in 2018 and to increase to 1.6% in 2019. And more positivity about the markets for 2018, this time from Goldman Sachs: Here\u2019s bit of context for the recent market falls: James Swanson, Chief Investment Strategist at asset manager MFS, is also in the \u2018correction not a crash\u2019 crew. He argues that the economics fundamentals are solid, so shares shouldn\u2019t keep plunging. Conditions don\u2019t appear to be in place for a prolonged market downturn. Corporate balance sheets remain strong, while fourth-quarter earnings have surpassed expectations. Additionally, the credit markets aren\u2019t signaling that a major shift in risk appetite has taken place. High-yield bond spreads have widened, but only marginally, from historically tight levels. Recent yield increases in non-investment-grade bonds have been driven more by rising Treasury rates than by growing credit concerns. That\u2019s a source of comfort for equity investors. In just over an hour, we\u2019ll discover if Wall Street agrees... London\u2019s stock market is creeping higher, helping the FTSE 100 recover from yesterday\u2019s 10-month low. The Footsie is now at its daily high, up 80 points or 1.1%. That shows that some confidence has returned to the City. However, it still leaves shares down 6% so far this year. Financial stocks are leading the rally, with energy stocks and utilities also in demand. City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta remains cautious, though: Whilst we don\u2019t expect this sell off to continue for an extended period of time, given that the fundamentals remain strong and unchanged, it is difficult to call the bottom and judge whether stocks have fallen sufficiently for investors to see value once again. After days of falls, Bitcoin is staging a rally today. The digital currency has bounced back up to $8,200, having hit a near-three month low below $6,000 on Tuesday. Bitcoin has been under pressure from regulators and politicians in recent weeks, keen to crack down on the use of digital currencies for money-laundering and reckless speculation. But Nigel Brahams, partner at London law firm Collyer Bristow, argues that we shouldn\u2019t write bitcoin off: \u201cThe current situation is like the dot com boom and bust in the late 1990s, when cynics who couldn\u2019t face up to a changing world wrote off new online businesses too readily. The weak businesses and valueless coins will fail, but the really good projects like Ethereum and Bitcoin are here to stay, much like Amazon 20 years ago.\u201d America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average is being called down 1%, when trading begins in three-and-a-half hour. There\u2019s less fear in the markets today, but volatility remains high, says Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades. It is curious considering the fact that for years we were fighting against low inflation or even deflation and now this correction is generated by growing expectations of inflation in the US. American stock indices lead the recovery in the last few year and now they spread the uncertainty around the world. Investors who had wagered that the markets would remain calm have been burned by this week\u2019s turmoil. For example, those who bought a security from Japanese bank Nomura, which moved inversely to market volatility, have lost almost all their money. Bloomberg explains: Nomura Holdings Inc. issued an apology after investors in a $300 million product betting on low volatility were all but wiped out during this week\u2019s stock-market turmoil. Japan\u2019s biggest brokerage said Wednesday that it has received inquiries from individual investors after its decision to redeem the exchange-traded notes at a 96 percent discount. \u201cWe sincerely apologize for causing significant difficulties to investors,\u201d its Nomura Europe Finance unit said in a statement a day earlier. Nomura\u2019s Next Notes S&amp;P500 VIX Short-Term Futures Inverse Daily Excess Return Index ETN involved a bet against stock-market gyrations by moving in the opposite direction to a gauge of volatility. Its early redemption -- the first of its kind in Japan -- was triggered after the notes lost more than 80 percent of their value amid the global equity-market selloff. The bulls still have the upper hand over the bears on Europe\u2019s trading floors today. After two hours trading, the main indices are all up, as investors hold their nerve. The FTSE 100 has dipped back a little, up 35 points at 7179. Germany\u2019s DAX is up 0.6%, while the Italian FTSE MIB has gained 0.9%. Shares may have found some support after recent losses, but it\u2019s not a strong recovery. Analysts at FX Pro reckon investors are using the turmoil as a cautious buying opportunity: It may still be too early to talk about a return to growth or to celebrate another fast and easy victory of the bull market. Rather, it seems more likely that panicked selling will give way to more calculated portfolio rebalancing. Reuters have a good explanation for how computerised trading, and bets on low volatility, combined to cause this week\u2019s market mayhem: It was a steep spike in yields last Friday that sparked the initial rout on Wall Street, forcing sales by a host of highly leveraged funds, which ramped up volatility and drove yet more selling. Many of these were algorithmic funds crowded into similar trades - long stocks and short volatility. The selling then cascaded through their computer systems in a way almost beyond human intervention. The pivotal gauge of S&amp;P 500 volatility, the VIX , did come off almost 20 points overnight but was still relatively elevated at 29.98 percent. \u201cShort volatility funds were caught by the spike in the VIX and had to cover,\u201d said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius until you\u2019re not and when it takes just a day or two to unwind your whole strategy then you were never a genius,\u201d he added. \u201cBut volatility does cluster, so there is no guarantee that markets are out of the woods yet.\u201d Important news out of Berlin. Angela Merkel has reportedly reached a deal with Germany\u2019s Social Democrats to create a new grand coalition. After overnight talks, the CDU/CSU and the SPD have broken the deadlock and hammered out a deal that - in principle - would return Merkel as chancellor, according to media reports from Germany. But... the SPD\u2019s members still have to approve the plan. They\u2019ll vote in the next few weeks. Intriguingly, it appears that the SPD could get control of the German finance ministry, and the foreign ministry. That could have significant impact on the eurozone\u2019s economic policy -- Germany\u2019s next finance minister might take a less hard-line approach on issues such as debt relief and eurobonds, compared to Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.... NEWSFLASH: UK house prices fell in January, according to the latest survey from Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices declined by 0.6% in the three months to January, following a 0.8% fall a month earlier. That takes the annual house price inflation rate down to 2.2%, compared with 2.7% in December. Halifax also found that fewer new homes are coming onto the market: New instructions to sell continued to deteriorate at the headline level and have now fallen for 23 consecutive months \u2013 the worst sequence for almost eight years. Here\u2019s some instant reaction: Today\u2019s rally means European stock markets are bucking a seven-day losing streak. But that doesn\u2019t mean the turbulence is over. Many of the factors blamed for the sell off -- such as fears of US interest rate hikes -- are still in place. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities research team explains: Investors seem to believe that the worst is over and that the sell-off was just a market tantrum that happens a couple of times a year but we tend to believe that there\u2019s more to come. As discussed above, the key catalysts behind the retreat in the equities markets have to do with the new reality in bond yields, concerns about a tighter Fed policy and doubts over the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s tax reforms. It was quite a mixed day in Asia, by the end, as the initial optimism from Wall Street faded: Here\u2019s what\u2019s up across Europe, and what\u2019s not.... Supermarket chain Tesco isn\u2019t joining the rally, though. Its shares are down 1%, after shopworkers launched an equal pay claim that could prove very expensive. My colleague Sarah Butler has the story: Tesco is facing a demand for up to \u00a34bn in back pay from thousands of mainly female shopworkers in what could become the UK\u2019s largest ever equal pay claim. A law firm has launched legal action on behalf of nearly 100 shop assistants who say they earn as much as \u00a33 an hour less than male warehouse workers in similar roles. Up to 200,000 shopfloor staff could be affected by the claim, which could cost Tesco up to \u00a320,000 per worker in back pay over at least six years. Tesco warehouse staff earn from about \u00a38.50 an hour up to more than \u00a311 an hour while store staff earn about \u00a38 an hour in basic pay, according to the claim. The disparity could mean a full-time distribution worker earning over \u00a35,000 a year more than store-based staff. Markets are rising across Europe, as a degree of calm returns to trading floors. The Stoxx 600 index is up 0.7% - a modest, rather than spectacular recovery. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, says: Just as markets cannot keep rising forever, they must also stop falling at some point, but it\u2019s still unclear whether we\u2019ve reached a level where buyers see value again. Futures prices had indicated a much brighter start for global markets, but early gains were wiped out in Asia and Europe looks vulnerable. Volatility is back, and investors had better get used to it. Shares are rising in London at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is up 65 points, or 0.9%, to 7205, as investors join the rally that began on Wall Street late last night. Pest control firm Rentokil is leading the risers, up 4.3%, followed by packaging firm Smurfit Kappa (+3.5%). It\u2019s only a small rebound, compared to yesterday\u2019s 2.6% tumble. Mike van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets says traders can\u2019t decide whether we\u2019re seeing a \u201ctechnical correction, or the opening sequence for a greater unwind.\u201d An unwind from a protracted period of historically low volatility, yields, borrowing costs and investor concern, which contributed to high levels of market valuation, passive investing, financial engineering and complacency. As the last few days have shown us, things are always \u201cdifferent this time\u201d, until of course, they\u2019re not. Royal Bank of Canada is concerned that the early rally in Asia fizzled out as today wore on. US equities recovered some ground in yesterday\u2019s session after the previous day\u2019s record losses. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 1.74% having lost over 4% the day before. The resurgence in volatility saw the VIX index hit an intraday high of over 50, a level not reached since 2015, having barely exceeded 15 for much of last year. Although Asian stock markets initially opened much higher on the back of the rebound in the US, that performance has faded. For example the Nikkei having been up as much as 3.4% on the day at one point is back to almost flat. Similarly, futures on US equity indices are sliding with the Dow off around 1% at the time of writing suggesting the sustainability of Tuesday\u2019s rebound in sentiment isn\u2019t assured at this stage. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European markets are rebounding this after two days of wild swings, but investors are still nervous. European stocks are tipped to bounce by at least 1% today, recovering some of Monday and Tuesday\u2019s sharp losses. That following a surprise late rally on Wall Street last night that saw the Dow jump by 567 points -- its biggest gain since Donald Trump was elected US president. Over in Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei has crept higher over night, but there were further losses in China. City traders are calling the FTSE 100 up 60 points today. That should please shareholders, until they remember that the blue-chip index shed almost 200 points on Tuesday, hitting a 10-month low. The other main European markets are expected to recover today as well. And worryingly, the futures market is suggesting that US stocks could fall back later today. So, it could be another volatile day.... Here\u2019s the agenda: 8.30am GMT: Halifax house price survey 1.30pm GMT: New York Federal Reserve chief William Dudley speaks at an event on Banking Culture in New York. 3.30pm GMT: The weekly US crude oil inventory figures",

If we get to that point and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted. </p> <p>In contrast, suppose inflation picks up more assuredly, as many expect. Then, we still could easily raise rates another three or even four times in 2018 if that were necessary. And I would support such a faster pace if the data point convincingly in this direction.</p> </blockquote> <p>Evans said he expected US GDP to grow between 2.5% and 2.75% this year, with growth slowing over the next two years as the boost from Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts wears off.</p> <p>As for inflation, he expects it to rise gradually over the next few years:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a hint that this may be in train today. Some inflation indicators over the past couple of months have been positive. I also am hearing a bit more commentary from manufacturers about higher commodity prices. While wage increases have been disappointingly low, the most recent data exhibit a firming trend. And I\u2019ve recently been hearing from more of my business contacts that firms are raising wages, giving additional bonuses, and boosting benefits. These are all positive signs for wage growth and clear signs of tighter labor markets.</p> <p>In my forecast, I expect inflation to rise gradually to our 2 percent target, perhaps reaching it in late 2019 or in 2020. But despite the indicators I just noted, I have not yet seen many actual increases in consumer prices. So, my forecast of reaching our target is still just a forecast. There is still a role for accommodative monetary policy to bring us back to our 2 percent inflation target.</p> </blockquote> <p>Evans voted against a rate rise in December but is a non-voting member this year, so his comments won\u2019t necessarily hold much sway when it comes to the path of interest rates, although his reasoning is interesting.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-07T16:43:14.154Z\">at 4.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a7b256fe4b07556c9fb7646\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-07T16:13:14.869Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The rout in stocks seen in the first two days of the week seems a long way away now, as a classic rebound in sentiment sees the Dow gain over 200 points within the first two hours, while the FTSE 100 continues to claw its way higher.</p> <p>The \u2018cash on the sidelines\u2019 theory gets a lot of stick these days, since who in their right mind would still hold cash when the market kept racing higher, but evidently equity investors (or their passive machine counterparts) have managed to scrimmage behind the sofa for some more funds in order to go bargain hunting in stock markets.

The disparity could mean a full-time distribution worker earning over \u00a35,000 a year more than store-based staff.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/961034993207316480\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Guardian front page, Wednesday 7 February 2018: Tesco may face \u00a34bn bill over equal pay claim <a href=\"https://t.co/RfyRbVNgPh\">pic.twitter.com/RfyRbVNgPh</a></p>&mdash; The Guardian (@guardian) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/961034993207316480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 7, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7ab587e4b0faf969c78da6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-07T08:26:50.033Z\">8.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets are rising across Europe, as a degree of calm returns to trading floors.</p> <p>The Stoxx 600 index is up 0.7% - a modest, rather than spectacular recovery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0773653e371d76548fa32a48da52e7468a233a4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0773653e371d76548fa32a48da52e7468a233a4b/0_0_937_286/500.jpg\" alt=\"European stock markets this morning\" width=\"500\" height=\"153\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European stock markets this morning</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just as markets cannot keep rising forever, they must also stop falling at some point, but it\u2019s still unclear whether we\u2019ve reached a level where buyers see value again.</p> <p>Futures prices had indicated a much brighter start for global markets, but early gains were wiped out in Asia and Europe looks vulnerable.

Emma Walmsley, GSK\u2019s chief executive, said the tight deadline was key to giving businesses the clarity needed to invest. \u201cThe most important thing is that we get a transition period of at least two years, starting from March 2019, but \u2026 secured by April 2018, and we need to make sure that the negotiations that are ongoing are very clearly focused on patient safety and the continued supply of medicines to patients.\u201d She said there was clearly \u201ca lot of work to do still\u201d at the political level and in the working groups that GSK is involved in. Walmsley stressed the need for mutual recognition agreements between the UK and the EU to avoid duplication of processes and called for \u201cthe fullest possible cooperation\u201d with the European Medicines Agency. The EMA, which has been based in London for two decades and approves medicines across the EU, is to relocate to Amsterdam. Scientists have warned that once Britain leaves the EU, it could take months longer for new drugs to become available in the UK if pharma companies have to re-register them for the British market. Drugmakers want to remain as close to the European regulatory system as possible. Walmsley also called for zero tariffs, if possible, on healthcare goods with minimal customs procedures to avoid long waiting times at the border; an immigration system that helps the country attract highly skilled scientists; and continued collaboration in research and development between the UK and the EU. She said the government recognised the importance of life sciences to Britain. \u201cI am hopeful that the government and the working groups can be pragmatic about the way forward, because we do think it is very necessary, so we can all deliver on what really matters, which is getting the right medicines to the patients.\u201d Her comments came as she unveiled the first set of full-year results since taking the helm at GSK last spring. The group made revenues of \u00a330.2bn last year, up 3% at constant exchange rates. Adjusted earnings per share, its preferred measure, rose 4% to 111.8p, while pretax profits jumped 58% to \u00a33.5bn. The company said it was \u201cincreasingly confident\u201d in its ability to drive growth over the next few years, despite the threat of competition from generic drugs to its bestselling asthma inhaler Advair.

      "bodyText": "The Church Investors Group has warned some of Britain\u2019s biggest companies it intends to take a hard line over failings on executive pay, gender diversity and climate change in the forthcoming annual meeting season. The group, which represents church organisations with combined investment assets of about \u00a317bn, has told companies listed on the FTSE 350 index it will refuse to re-elect directors at firms failing to make sufficient progress in key areas. \u201cThe best companies contribute to the common good through their products and services and the way they treat their employees,\u201d said the Rev Canon Edward Carter, chair of the CIG. \u201cTheir directors understand that if they are not doing something about fairness and about the risks facing us today, they are part of the problem and risk losing the confidence of the public and ultimately their licence to operate.\u201d The group\u2019s members have invested in companies including Tesco, Royal Dutch Shell, AstraZenca and HSBC. It backs investment policies based on Christian ethical principles and represents institutional investors from mainstream Christian church denominations and charities, including the main investment bodies of the Church of England and the Methodist church. Outlining its new voting policy, the CIG said its members would vote against executive pay packages where pay ratios are not disclosed, excessive pensions for chief executives or where financial services or pharmaceutical companies do not pay the living wage. It will also scrutinise a company\u2019s record on gender diversity, voting against the re-election of nomination committee chairs if women make up less than a third of the board. If the proportion of women drops below 25%, CIG members will vote against all directors on the committee. According to the latest figures published by the government-backed Hampton-Alexander review \u2013 which aims to increase the number of women on FTSE boards \u2013 there were 301 firms in the FTSE 350 at the end of June 2017 where the proportion of women on the board was less than 33%. A total of 170 firms would have failed the CIG\u2019s test of having female board representation equivalent to less than 25%, including BP, Barclays, Prudential and Just Eat. The proportion of women on boards falls to just 9% at the pub and restaurants group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, and there are no women at all on the board of Sports Direct, the retailer founded and run by Mike Ashley. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, welcomed the new voting policy adopted by the CIG, and said the group was \u201cputting some teeth into the issues, which is necessary\u201d. Climate change is the third key area for the CIG, which said its members would vote against the re-election of the chair if a company is making little progress on the transition to a low-carbon world. \u201cChurch investors have long sought to address excessive executive pay and encourage the adoption of the living wage,\u201d said Stephen Beer, chief investment officer of the central finance board of the Methodist church. \u201cOur new policy will enable us to send a clear signal to companies that we expect them to consider fairness when setting executive pay levels.

      "bodyText": "The draft report by the Productivity Commission into competition in the financial sector released on Tuesday is a withering attack on the banking sector \u2013 one that paints it as bloated and uncompetitive, and which has seen a focus on stability override a desire for competition. The Australian banking sector is dominated by the big four \u2013 Commonwealth, Westpac, ANZ and NAB. Together they control just over 80% of all owner occupier home loans and 85% of all investor housing loans: This high market share was not always the case. From the mid 1990s to mid 2000s cheap credit from international lenders saw an influx of non-bank lenders, which reduced the share of home loans to banks to around 75%. And then the GFC hit \u2013 cheap credit dried up, non-bank lenders either folded or were taken over by banks and the big four consolidated: The impact of the GFC and the desire for financial stability hangs over the Productivity Commission\u2019s report, which argues that many of the measures designed to increase financial stability have the unintended consequence of reducing competition. Indeed, policies designed to promote stability have also meant that the big banks have done very well from the GFC. The report notes that such is the market power of the big four, \u201cthe shock of the GFC saw barely a blip in the net interest margins of major institutions\u201d. One of the biggest ructions during the GFC was the jump in the price of short-term credit \u2013 credit which had been used by both non-banks and banks to fund a significant chunk of their lending: This meant banks had to get funding from elsewhere \u2013 and the easiest place was from Australian deposits. It meant the interest rates for term deposits quickly went up \u2013 great for investors, but it meant the cost of finance for banks also rose: Banks over the past decade have used this as the excuse for not cutting home loans by as much as the cash rate. But despite the costs of both term deposits and short-term finance no longer being at levels they were during the GFC, the difference between interest rates offered by banks for both home loans and small business loans and the cash rate is now much greater than occurred during the GFC: A similar increase has occurred for the interest rates of credit cards. Since the middle of 2014 the average credit-card interest rate has been 19.75% \u2013 during that time the cash rate has fallen from 2.5% to the current 1.5%: Now the Productivity Commission does argue that recent \u201cmacro-prudential\u201d measures designed to increase financial stability \u2013 such as limiting investor credit growth and liquidity coverage requirements \u2013 have \u201cundoubtedly increased\u201d the costs to banks. But pointedly it argues \u201cthe bulk of these costs have been passed on to new and existing borrowers\u201d. Indeed, if we look at the difference between what banks charge in interest for home loans and what they pay in interest for term deposits, we can see that the situation is actually better now for banks than it was prior to the GFC: This has meant, as the commission noted, that while individual banks might \u201cjostle to attract new borrowers with hints of slightly different interest rates, consumers overall are unable to make effective use of this\u201d. And one problem is that the loyalty of customers is not rewarded with lower rates. Banks in effect know most people don\u2019t change their bank, and thus they take advantage of that loyalty. One measure the Commission argues is for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to provide an online service that allows \u201cconsumers to select different combinations of loan and borrower characteristics\u201d and to compare interest rates of loans and the specific fees and charges that would affect the total cost of a loan. But while there are things that could be done to improve competition, one problem is that moves to improve stability of the sector are not only limiting competition they are making banks more profitable \u2013 at taxpayer\u2019s expense. Moves such as limiting lending to investors, and reducing interest-only loans to 30% of new mortgage loans, which have dampened somewhat the boom in the housing market, have also created, the commission argues, \u201ca windfall profit opportunity\u201d. The issue is that the Apra sought to reduce investor housing lending and interest-only loans because these are inherently more risky and also more likely to lead to a housing price bubble. As a result, banks increased investor loan interest rates: And while that in itself is fine, the problem is that the banks have increased the interest rates \u201con both new and existing investment loans\u201d. This, the Commission argues \u201cboosted lenders\u2019 profit on home loans, and saw a decline in competition from some smaller lenders in the home loan market.\u201d These new regulations have not only increased the net interest margins for banks, they have also led to an indirect cost to the community. Because the interest paid by investors has increased, this also raises the ability for these investors to negatively gear their properties. As a result, an extra $500m per year was paid in taxation deduction to negative gearers \u2013 an amount that would only be partially offset by increased tax paid by banks making greater profits. The report is a timely one given the banking royal commission begins sitting next week. It highlights the conflict between efforts to improve stability and competition \u2013 the initial response from both the government and the opposition appears to be that stability remains the key concern \u2013 and the power of the big four looks set to remain. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter in his first public comment on the sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,175 points on Monday following another sharp fall last Friday. The drop appears to have been triggered by news of stronger than expected growth in wages, which fueled expectations of a higher rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Commenting on the markets on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the US economy was \u201cincredibly strong\u201d and \u201cnothing that\u2019s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that\u2019s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago\u201d. Since his election, US \u2013 and global \u2013 stock markets have hit record highs. Trump has consistently pointed to rising stock markets as proof his economic policies are working. While his corporate tax cuts and push for deregulation have pushed share prices higher, US markets have been on a record-breaking streak for nine years and have risen in large part thanks to economic strength around the world and unprecedentedly low interest rates. That period of low rates now appears to be coming to an end as central banks worry about inflation. Those fears are leading to greater volatility in the stock market.",

Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter in his first public comment on the sell-off.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8976968a-1793-4b44-9246-7caeb7e0bdc8\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Why are stock markets falling?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For several weeks, economists and analysts have warned that inflation levels in major economies could increase this year beyond the 2% to 3% that central banks believe is good for developed countries. Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,175 points on Monday following another sharp fall last Friday. The drop appears to have been triggered by news of stronger than expected growth in wages, which fueled expectations of a higher rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve.</p> \n<p>Commenting on the markets on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the US economy was \u201cincredibly strong\u201d and \u201cnothing that\u2019s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that\u2019s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago\u201d.</p> \n<p>Since his election, US \u2013 and global \u2013 stock markets have hit record highs. Trump has consistently pointed to rising stock markets as proof his economic policies are working.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/935636972252618753\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all finished the day at new RECORD HIGHS! <a href=\"https://t.co/wJyB9d00hh\">pic.twitter.com/wJyB9d00hh</a></p>\u2014 Donald J.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A quarter of people working in Britain\u2019s fast-growing gig economy are being paid below the national minimum wage, government research has revealed. An estimated 700,000 people are earning less than the mandatory \u00a37.50 per hour working as couriers, taxi drivers and in other self-employed work, according to the first research of its kind for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. NatCen Social Research carried out the study before long-awaited labour market reforms were announced by the government on Wednesday, which were widely criticised for failing to provide new protections for gig workers and promising only consultation on law changes. The national minimum wage does not apply to self-employed workers. About 2.8 million people worked in the gig economy in the 12 months to August 2017, including freelancers and one-person businesses, the research estimated. Most used it to supplement other work. It found that 42% had worked for courier firms, 37% on apps or websites such as Task Rabbit and 28% for minicab apps such as Uber. Takeaway delivery gig workers accounted for 21%. The chairman of the Commons work and pensions select committee, Frank Field, said the figures showed gig work was now \u201cthe single biggest force in the British economy undermining the national living wage\u201d. He wants the minimum wage extended \u201cto the small army of workers who are exposed to poverty pay because they are forced into forms of self-employment that are unrecognisable to most people\u201d. The extent of low pay in the gig economy came amid growing concern at the government\u2019s ability to tackle the negative consequences of a sector that has boomed following the advent of phone apps such as Uber and Deliveroo. The business secretary, Greg Clark, admitted on Wednesday that the death of a diabetic gig courier for DPD, Don Lane, was a \u201cterrible tragedy\u201d and faced claims that none of the long-awaited labour market reforms the government announced would have saved him. Lane, 53, collapsed and died from diabetes after being fined \u00a3150 by the courier company DPD for attending a hospital appointment to treat his disease. On Monday the Guardian revealed he had missed three other hospital appointments to treat kidney damage, partly because he was afraid of being fined. He collapsed at the wheel of his van while on deliveries a few months later before dying in January. Amid widespread anger at his treatment, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, told the House of Commons: \u201cThe tragic case of Don Lane, DPD gig worker, epitomised the precarious and unstable working life many people face and the failure of the government to protect workers.\u201d She said: \u201cThey needed to do something bold today but it appears they are simply papering over these bleak realities with rhetoric. Launching four consultations, merely considering proposals and tweaking the law here and there is not good enough. How would any of this have actually helped Don Lane? It simply wouldn\u2019t, that\u2019s the fact of the matter.\u201d The business minister Andrew Griffiths replied that the government was \u201cacting to ensure good work for all\u201d and said \u201cmillions of workers will get greater rights and the access to more protection\u201d. He said: \u201cThe house should be clear. We are consulting in order to act.\u201d Lane was treated by DPD as self-employed and there was anger from similar gig economy workers on Wednesday at the government\u2019s planned labour market reforms. Clark said Lane\u2019s death was \u201ca terrible tragedy\u201d and added: \u201cAnyone who is performing work should be clear in a way that too often they are not at the moment whether they are an employee, whether they are a contractor, in which case they are entitled to sick pay. And if they are self-employed then the contractual terms that they operate under must not be so onerous that they should be abusive.\u201d He added: \u201cIf they are self-employed then it is very important that those conditions should not be so onerous as to be unreasonable for example for a person who is sick to be able to take an appointment.\u201d In a statement DPD said Lane should not have been fined but denied not accommodating his health needs. Employment lawyers on Wednesday called the government\u2019s response to the review by Matthew Taylor of modern working practices \u201cunderwhelming\u201d and \u201cfeeble\u201d, amid widespread fears that significant reform could be slow in coming. The chief executive of the employment lawyer Thompsons, Stephen Cavalier, said: \u201cIt is a limp response to a limp report, which offers nothing but vague platitudes which don\u2019t get to the heart of the issue. On the fundamental issue of defining whether someone is an employee, a worker or self-employed, all that is proposed in the report is yet more consultation.\u201d Susannah Kintish at Mishcon de Reya , who is representing Pimlico Plumbers in a supreme court case about the employment status of its plumbers, said: \u201cThe proposals seem underwhelming. There seems to be a focus on transparency rather than any fundamental changes to the law on employment status.\u201d A spokesperson for the business department said the Taylor review showed the majority of people in the gig economy enjoy the independence and flexibility of their work. \u201cBut we recognise that this is not always the case which is why we will be making it easier for all workers to understand their rights and have them enforced, as part of our major workplace reforms.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Poundland\u2019s risque Christmas ads featuring a naughty elf playing strip poker and performing a sex act on a Barbie doll have been banned by the advertising watchdog. The budget retailer posted a series of eight images showing a toy elf in suggestive poses with other toys in the run-up to Christmas. The campaign, dubbed \u201cElf behaving bad\u201d, ran on Poundland\u2019s Twitter and Facebook accounts with images including the elf on a donkey with the line \u201cDon\u2019t tell Rudolph I\u2019ve found a new piece of ass\u201d. Other images showed the elf having drawn a pair of breasts on a car windscreen, sitting beside a sketch of a penis-shaped Christmas tree, and thrusting a toothbrush between its legs in a sexual manner. The Advertising Standards Authority received 85 complaints that the ads were offensive for depicting \u201ctoy characters and other items displayed in a sexualised manner\u201d and should not have been put on social media where children could see them. Poundland defended the campaign, arguing it was based on \u201chumour and double entendres\u201d that were not intended to be understood by children. The company added that Twitter and Facebook also have policies that are meant to ban under-13s from having accounts. Poundland said it never sought to encourage anyone other than adults to follow its Facebook and Twitter accounts, and that it did not intend to offend anyone. The ASA said Poundland\u2019s social media pages were \u201cnot age-gated and could be seen by anyone\u201d. The ad watchdog also said that the irreverent Christmas campaign had been shared widely on social media and would have been seen by \u201ca large number of people, including some children\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Economic growth in the UK is poised to rebound this year after a slowdown in 2017, as a strong global performance offsets the impact from the Brexit vote, a leading economic forecaster has said. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the strength of the world economy and the benefit for British exporters from the weak pound would help increase GDP growth by almost 2% this year and next \u2013 which was higher than many other forecasts. Against this backdrop, it said, the Bank of England would probably raise interest rates in May and again within six months. The NIESR\u2019s expectation of GDP growing by 1.9% this year and in 2019 is a rise from the previous estimate of 1.7% for both years. The institute said the change reflected the more positive outlook for the global economy and took into account some of the progress made by ministers to move the Brexit talks on to trade matters. The upgrade stands in sharp contrast to the expectations of other respected economic forecasters, such as the International Monetary Fund, that Britain will experience a further slowdown this year after recording its slowest growth since 2012 last year. UK growth dropped to 1.8% in 2017 from 1.9% in 2016. Analysts at the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s independent forecaster, revealed a sharp fall in growth expectations alongside the budget in the autumn. They forecast that the rate of expansion would fall to 1.4% this year before dropping further still to 1.3% in 2019, amid a deterioration in consumer spending triggered by the Brexit vote. However, the UK economy is benefiting from a sustained upswing in growth across the developed world, from the US and China to the eurozone, as the world economy finally recovers from the ravages of the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 despite this week\u2019s stock market gyrations. Britain recorded its fastest rate of growth in the final three months of the year, despite some pockets of weakness triggered by the EU referendum. Consumer spending has fallen as a consequence of weak wage growth and the fall in the value of the pound in the aftermath of the EU referendum, which drove up the cost of imports. However, the NIESR said the weaker exchange rate and buoyant global demand for goods and services was helping to rebalance the economy away from domestic growth and towards stronger export growth. Inflation is expected to drop this year as the impact of the fall in the pound washes its way out of the system, having potentially peaked at 3.1% at the end of last year, which is expected to help pave the way for a rebound in consumer spending. The NIESR said it expected the Bank to raise interest rates by 25 basis points every six months from May, until the cost of borrowing hit 2% from a current level of 0.5%. The performance of the economy could have been a lot worse without the rebound in global growth, the NIESR added: UK economic growth would have been around 1.2% last year as a consequence of the EU referendum, instead of 1.8%. \u201cThe contribution of the global recovery to the UK has been critical,\u201d the thinktank said. There are, however, risks ahead should the Brexit talks fail. The NIESR said its forecasts were reliant on Britain achieving a soft Brexit or retaining almost-full access to the EU market. Failure to reach a deal and Britain falling back to trading with the EU using World Trade Organization rules would lead to a long-term annual loss in GDP per capita of up to \u00a32,000, or almost 6%, relative to the current expectations.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco is facing a demand for up to \u00a34bn in back pay from thousands of mainly female shopworkers in what could become the UK\u2019s largest ever equal pay claim. A law firm has launched legal action on behalf of nearly 100 shop assistants who say they earn as much as \u00a33 an hour less than male warehouse workers in similar roles. Up to 200,000 shopfloor staff could be affected by the claim, which could cost Tesco up to \u00a320,000 per worker in back pay over at least six years. Tesco warehouse staff earn from about \u00a38.50 an hour up to more than \u00a311 an hour while store staff earn about \u00a38 an hour in basic pay, according to the claim. The disparity could mean a full-time distribution worker earning over \u00a35,000 a year more than store-based staff. The legal firm behind the action, Leigh Day, has begun submitting claims through Acas, the conciliation service, as the first step before heading to the employment tribunal. The case follows similar actions against Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s which are working their way through the employment tribunal process. Nearly 20,000 people are involved in the Asda case, where the latest ruling backed the shopworkers\u2019 right to compare their jobs to employees \u2013 mainly men \u2013 working in distribution centres. Asda is due to appeal against that ruling at the court of appeal in October. About 1,000 workers are involved in the Sainsbury\u2019s action. Unequal pay has also become a big battleground in the public sector, with female cleaners and dinner ladies taking legal action over claims that they were paid less than binmen or male street cleaners. Birmingham city council agreed to pay more than \u00a31bn to settle the claims of tens of thousands of women which stretch back over many years. Paula Lee, a Leigh Day lawyer who is representing the Tesco women, said: \u201cWe believe an inherent bias has allowed store workers to be underpaid over many years. \u201cThere might be lifting and carrying in the distribution centre but there is also lifting and carrying in shops as well as dealing with customers asking questions and handling money.\u201d She said that men working in roles that have historically been predominantly carried out by women \u2013 jobs grouped under the five Cs of caring, cleaning, clerical, cashiering and catering \u2013 also tended to be underpaid. \u201cIt is nuanced and complex but we do need to change how we measure work and value work,\u201d she said. Kim Element, 56, who has worked as a shop assistant at Tesco for 23 years and is currently a merchandising assistant in its Hemel Hempstead store\u2019s clothing department, said she had decided to take part in the legal action after taking a pay cut recently. She was upset to find that the mostly male warehouse workers continued to receive double pay for Sunday shifts while she and other long-serving shop staff were recently forced off that rate on to time and a half. Mindful of undercutting colleagues, they took the pay cut, worth about \u00a3200 a month to Element, to bring their pay in line with newer shopfloor staff. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be fair it should be fair across the board,\u201d Element said. \u201cIt makes me feel highly disappointed. If we are doing a job of equal value we should be paid accordingly. \u201cWe are the face of Tesco. In the warehouse they don\u2019t deal with customer inquiries. We build relationships with customers and that is just one aspect of the job. We are still pulling cages of stock, unbagging clothes.\u201d Pam Jenkins, 57, has worked for Tesco for 26 years and currently works mainly nights on the shopfloor in Tesco\u2019s Baldock store in Hertfordshire. She is paid about \u00a38 an hour and also recently lost out when Tesco reduced premium pay rates for Sunday shifts. Her job involves collecting stock from the warehouse, stocking shelves and dealing with customers. \u201cIt is quite hands-on manual work,\u201d she said. Jenkins said: \u201cTesco is a good employer. They just need to get their facts right. They say they want everybody to be equal. It should be equal pay for equal value. I do feel let down and a bit miffed to say the least.\u201d Tesco said it would consider any changes to pay in partnership with Usdaw, the trade union which represents the majority of its shopfloor staff. The supermarket said it was yet to receive details of any claim. Tesco said: \u201cWe are unable to comment on a claim that we have not received. Tesco has always been a place for people to get on in their career, regardless of their gender, background or education, and we work hard to make sure all our colleagues are paid fairly and equally for the jobs they do.\u201d",

Asda is due to appeal against that ruling at the court of appeal in October. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/sainsburys-faces-equal-pay-battle-with-female-shop-floor-workers\">About 1,000 workers are involved in the Sainsbury\u2019s action</a>.</p> <p>Unequal pay has also become a big battleground in the public sector, with female cleaners and dinner ladies taking legal action over claims that they were paid less than binmen or male street cleaners. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/apr/11/equal-pay-women-birmingham-city-council\">Birmingham city council agreed to pay more than \u00a31bn</a> to settle the claims of tens of thousands of women which stretch back over many years.</p> <p>Paula Lee, a Leigh Day lawyer who is representing the Tesco women, said: \u201cWe believe an inherent bias has allowed store workers to be underpaid over many years.</p> <p>\u201cThere might be lifting and carrying in the distribution centre but there is also lifting and carrying in shops as well as dealing with customers asking questions and handling money.\u201d</p> <p>She said that men working in roles that have historically been predominantly carried out by women \u2013 jobs grouped under the five Cs of caring, cleaning, clerical, cashiering and catering \u2013 also tended to be underpaid. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c04f387f2b31a8271e3b865fb88c163bb3bafcc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c04f387f2b31a8271e3b865fb88c163bb3bafcc9/0_230_4229_2538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Groceries prepared for distribution at Tesco\u2019s distribution plant at Reading\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Groceries prepared for distribution at Tesco\u2019s distribution plant at Reading.

Mindful of undercutting colleagues, they took the pay cut, worth about \u00a3200 a month to Element, to bring their pay in line with newer shopfloor staff. </p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s going to be fair it should be fair across the board,\u201d Element said. \u201cIt makes me feel highly disappointed. If we are doing a job of equal value we should be paid accordingly.</p> <p>\u201cWe are the face of Tesco. In the warehouse they don\u2019t deal with customer inquiries. We build relationships with customers and that is just one aspect of the job. We are still pulling cages of stock, unbagging clothes.\u201d</p> <p>Pam Jenkins, 57, has worked for Tesco for 26 years and currently works mainly nights on the shopfloor in Tesco\u2019s Baldock store in Hertfordshire. She is paid about \u00a38 an hour and also recently lost out when Tesco reduced premium pay rates for Sunday shifts.</p> <p>Her job involves collecting stock from the warehouse, stocking shelves and dealing with customers. \u201cIt is quite hands-on manual work,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Jenkins said: \u201cTesco is a good employer. They just need to get their facts right. They say they want everybody to be equal. It should be equal pay for equal value. I do feel let down and a bit miffed to say the least.\u201d</p> <p>Tesco said it would consider any changes to pay in partnership with Usdaw, the trade union which represents the majority of its shopfloor staff.</p> <p>The supermarket said it was yet to receive details of any claim. Tesco said: \u201cWe are unable to comment on a claim that we have not received. Tesco has always been a place for people to get on in their career, regardless of their gender, background or education, and we work hard to make sure all our colleagues are paid fairly and equally for the jobs they do.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Gig economy workers have expressed anger that long-awaited changes to working practices in Britain have stopped short of bringing in new laws to prevent bogus self-employment, which denies basic rights to around 1.1 million couriers, minicab drivers and other workers. Theresa May announced a raft of new labour policies that she said would mean \u201ctangible progress\u201d towards upholding workers\u2019 rights, in response to a Downing Street-commissioned review by Matthew Taylor. But there was disappointment from workers, trade unions and Labour that the government has only pledged to consult on possible changes to the use of self-employment, which may not include changing the law. The issue was brought into sharp focus this week following the death of Don Lane, 53, a self-employed courier for DPD who missed medical appointments to treat his diabetes, partly because he was afraid of facing \u00a3150 a day charges that formed part of his contract as \u201cfranchisee\u201d with DPD. The case provoked widespread outrage and on Tuesday, John Lewis joined Marks &amp; Spencer as major customers of DPD, in demanding answers from the parcel company over its treatment of Lane. There had been hope the government would bring employment law into line with the judgments of several employment tribunals that have ruled in favour of gig economy workers \u2013 including for Uber and City Sprint \u2013 which ruled they are workers and not self-employed and so should enjoy paid holiday, the minimum wage and other rights. But citing the complexity of the issue, the government only said it would launch \u201ca detailed consultation examining options, including new legislation, to make it easier for both the workforce and businesses to understand whether someone is an employee, worker or self-employed\u201d. May said: \u201cWe recognise the world of work is changing and we have to make sure we have the right structures in place to reflect those changes, enhancing the UK\u2019s position as one of the best places in the world to do business.\u201d Maggie Dewhurst, 30, a delivery courier who won a tribunal claim against City Sprint, said she was furious. \u201cThis is the industry\u2019s dream result and does nothing to protect workers,\u201d she said. \u201cBy not enforcing our existing employment laws but instead talking about making the system \u2018easier to understand\u2019, they are playing into gig employers\u2019 hands, many of whom are wilfully breaking UK law. How much more evidence do we need of gig economy exploitation?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t they change the law now,\u201d said Lane\u2019s widow, Ruth, who believes her husband should have had employment rights including sick pay. \u201cDon has died and they should be making changes.\u201d The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, accused May of \u201cmore words with no real action to improve the lives of the millions of people in insecure work\u201d. Among the other measures May announced were: Asking the low pay commission to consider a higher minimum wage for people on zero-hours contracts. Considering repealing laws allowing agencies to employ workers on cheaper rates. A right for zero-hours agency workers to request a fixed-hours contract. Bigger fines for companies that are repeat offenders at using people in bogus self-employment. Taylor described the government response to his review as substantive and said: \u201cIt will make a difference to the lives of the most vulnerable workers.\u201d He said: \u201cOn issues including pay for variable hours workers, employment status and representation of workers I welcome the direction indicated today, but there is more work to be done to encourage the government to be bold in living up to its commitment to good work for all.\u201d The Labour MP Frank Field, the chairman of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said the government had announced \u201csome really valuable gains for workers\u201d, but added: \u201cYet more consultation on the crunch issue of bogus self-employment? \u2026 The country is crying out for action.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the secretary general of the TUC, said: \u201cThese plans won\u2019t stop the hire and fire culture of zero-hours contracts or sham self-employment. And they will still leave 1.8 million workers excluded from key protections.\u201d Mohaan Biswas, 25, a courier for Deliveroo, said the government appeared to be kicking the issue of bogus self-employment into the long grass. He said: \u201cThey are just excusing themselves for longer and more people can be exploited while they do the consultation. This doesn\u2019t seem like actual progress.\u201d",
