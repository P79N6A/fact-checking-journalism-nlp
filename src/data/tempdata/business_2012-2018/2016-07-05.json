      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has warned that up to 600 head office jobs are at risk in its \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos owner Home Retail Group, but promised the deal would ultimately create several hundred new roles. The potential impact on staff was revealed as the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, Mike Coupe, reiterated his commitment to the takeover. Other merger deals have stalled amid uncertainty created by the EU referendum result. \u201cI remain convinced by the strategic rationale of the deal,\u201d Coupe said. \u201cWe believe that we can still deliver against the synergies and the execution that we\u2019ve outlined in the document, regardless of what economic conditions prevail.\u201d The details of how the two businesses would be merged were outlined in a 188-page prospectus published on Tuesday. The document warned of the potential post-Brexit risks to the UK economy and trade in Sainsbury\u2019s stores, but finance chief John Rogers, who will run Argos once the deal is completed, said this was standard practice. \u201cIt\u2019s sensible to include a risk that captures the volatility of the economic environment,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve called Brexit out specifically because that\u2019s something that\u2019s very current in the economic backdrop.\u201d In the document, Sainsbury\u2019s estimates a reduction of \u201capproximately 400 to 600 roles across corporate and support functions\u201d. The final number will depend on the outcome of a more detailed review after the merger is completed, which is expected to be in September. Sainsbury\u2019s said that 200 to 300 store jobs would be eliminated by plans to relocate Argos\u2019s high street branches to its supermarkets, although it added that many staff would move over. Despite the workforce changes, the UK\u2019s second largest retailer insisted the takeover of Argos would create jobs because new Argos stores would be opened, as well as additional collection points in its supermarkets. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s expects the overall effect of the acquisition on the combined headcount of the group to be positive over the long term. It is expected that the net increase of around 1,000 or more retail operations roles will more than counterbalance the 400 to 600 reduction in corporate and support function roles,\u201d the company said. It added that there was \u201cno current intention\u201d to close Home Retail\u2019s head office in Milton Keynes or the Sainsbury\u2019s office in Coventry, although certain functions may move between Milton Keynes and other Sainsbury\u2019s office locations. The prospectus revealed that putting the deal together had cost Sainsbury\u2019s more than \u00a330m in advisory fees, while Home Retail had a bill for close to \u00a319m. Some analysts think the merger \u2013 which will turn Sainsbury\u2019s into Britain\u2019s biggest non-food retailer \u2013 is risky as it will put the business in the firing line of any Brexit-related high street downturn. But Coupe warned against paying too much attention to initial post-Brexit surveys, which have indicated a dip in consumer confidence. \u201cTo predict the future off 10 days\u2019 worth of data I think is impossible,\u201d he said. The chief executive also warned that talk of a recession could prove self-fulfilling: \u201cThere is a danger that we\u2019ll talk ourselves into it.\u201d On Monday, Coupe said he was ending Sainsbury\u2019s joint venture with discount chain Netto, with Netto\u2019s 16 stores set to close in August, putting 400 jobs at risk. Sainsbury\u2019s said it would make a \u00a320m writedown on Netto\u2019s assets and spend \u00a310m on winding down the business. Although Sainsbury\u2019s hopes to complete the Home Retail deal by the autumn, it is currently being considered by the competition regulator, which said in May it would decide by 25 July whether to launch a full investigation. The cash and shares deal was agreed in April and at the time was worth about \u00a31.4bn. However, Sainsbury\u2019s shares have fallen 19% over the last three months, reducing the deal\u2019s value.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The wife of retail tycoon Sir Philip Green has defended their use of companies based in tax havens, praising their \u201cstrong regulatory regimes\u201d. Tina Green provided details of what has been described as the \u201ccomplex web\u201d of companies behind the family\u2019s retail empire in a written response to MPs investigating the collapse of high street retailer BHS. Lady Green, who is based in Monaco, gave details of 11 companies in which she or her wider family hold the controlling stake, with the majority incorporated in Jersey and the British Virgin Islands. However, she claimed the choice of jurisdiction was not related to the benevolent tax regimes. \u201cMy understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes and well-respected regulators and the size and competence of their professional communities,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, my husband is not, nor has he ever been, a director or a shareholder of any of the non-UK companies referred to.\u201d The committee, jointly chaired by the MPs Frank Field and Iain Wright, wrote to Lady Green last month after evidence from advisers and executives linked to the BHS scandal raised fresh questions for the couple, who sold the department store chain to a serial bankrupt, Dominic Chappell, for \u00a31 last year. The Greens have an estimated \u00a33.2bn fortune. The collapse of BHS in April also led to Philip Green being called before MPs to explain how the business had been left in such a perilous state. His wife was not called before the parliamentary inquiry. At that time Wright said the evidence pointed to a \u201ccomplex and very opaque web of privately owned family businesses\u201d that helped make the deal possible. \u201cWe are keen to follow the money and look forward to Lady Green in her capacity as owner and ultimate beneficiary of these companies writing to us,\u201d he said. In her letter Green confirmed that she had been resident in Monaco since 1998 and was domiciled there. She also revealed income of \u00a328.2m in the year to 30 September 2015, from the repayment plus interest of a \u00a3200m loan raised by one of the family companies to finance the purchase of BHS. The fixed-rate loan notes, which attract interest of 8% a year, are listed on the Channel Islands Stock Exchange. Field said of Lady Green\u2019s response: \u201cI am not much closer to understanding the complex web of offshore Green companies but I am intrigued to learn that, while the attraction of Monaco is its fine schools, the British Virgin Islands and Jersey are favoured for their robust regulatory regimes.\u201d \u201cWhat is clear, however, is that Green was paid \u00a328m offshore, in the latest accounting year, for the acquisition of BHS by Taveta, another family company,\u201d he added. Field said there would be no more hearings before parliament breaks for the summer, but that it would soon publish its interim report. Philip Green, who together with other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments from BHS during his 15 years in charge of the retailer, told MPs during his appearance before the inquiry that he would \u201cgive assurance to the 20,000 pensioners that I am here to sort [the pension deficit] in the correct way\u201d. The scheme, which is being assessed for a bailout by the state-backed Pensions Protection Fund, has a \u00a3571m deficit. Field said it had asked Lady Green for additional information, including the minutes of board meetings and tax certificates on payments made to the Green family as it tries to get to the bottom of the affair. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d he said. Earlier this week, Chappell defended his role in the collapse of the retailer, which had 11,000 staff, telling Newsnight his consortium had taken a chance on BHS. \u201cWe were the only people to stick our heads above the parapet and give it a go, otherwise Philip [Green] would have liquidated that company,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thousands of people would have lost their jobs straight away. We gave it the best shot we possibly could. We did everything we could to save that company.\u201d Field, however, has described Chappell as a \u201cWalter Mitty\u201d character \u2013 a reference to the fictional character who lived in his own fantasy world. The committee has heard allegations that Chappell tried to pay for a family holiday to the Bahamas on company expenses and took a \u00a390,000 loan from the department store chain to pay a personal tax bill. Last month, BHS\u2019s administrators Duff &amp; Phelps sold the retailer\u2019s online operation and 70 overseas stores to Doha-based Al Mana Group. The administrators are continuing to negotiate the future of 164 UK outlets. Up to 11,000 jobs remain at risk in the UK, with hopes fading of securing a buyer for a large chunk of the chain as a going concern. All the stores continue to trade, but are running closing down sales while administrators continue to negotiate with potential buyers.",

      "bodyText": "The fallout from the Brexit vote reverberated through the markets on Tuesday as two more City property funds barred investors from withdrawing their cash and the Bank of England warned that risks to the financial system had begun to \u201ccrystallise\u201d. City watchers warned that further property funds would be forced to bar withdrawals as investors race for the door amid fears of a plunge in the values of office blocks and shopping centres in post-Brexit Britain. The suspensions came on another day of drama on the financial markets, 11 days after the vote to leave the EU wrong-footed investors and sparked political turmoil. Developments included: \u2022 The pound plunging to a new 31-year low against the dollar, falling 2% to $1.30 at one point. \u2022 A closely watched survey of the services sector coming in worse than expected, indicating a sharp slowdown in the wider economy. \u2022 The Bank of England easing regulations on banks to allow them to release up to \u00a3150bn worth of loans to households and businesses. \u2022 Chancellor George Osborne held a summit with the heads of the major high street banks, who pledged to avoid a new credit crisis by making loans available. The property funds barring withdrawals included M&amp;G Investments, which runs a \u00a34.4bn property fund, and Aviva Investors, whose fund has assets worth \u00a31.8bn. The moves came one day after Standard Life banned its clients from doing the same on its \u00a32.9bn property fund, with the firms saying they had acted to stop a rush of withdrawals following \u201cextraordinary market circumstances\u201d. Investors have been buying into commercial property funds to try to benefit from the 40% rise in commercial property prices since the 2009 crisis. But concerns that the market may have peaked before the referendum \u2013 plus fears on the impact of the Brexit vote on the UK economy \u2013 has triggered nervy investors to ask for their cash back. Large-scale outflows cause problems for commercial property funds because they are based on assets that are difficult to sell quickly when investors want their money back. Restrictions on withdrawals are then put in place to give fund managers time to sell their properties. Otherwise, they would be forced to sell assets at fire-sale prices to fund the redemption requests. That would drive down the fund\u2019s value, encouraging more investors to cash out, creating a vicious circle. The Bank of England said in its half-yearly assessment of risks to the financial system published on Tuesday said that some of the risks to the financial system it had warned about in the run-up to the referendum had \u201cbegun to crystallise\u201d, including the possible downturn in the commercial real estate market. Around \u00a335bn \u2013 or 7% of the total investment in UK commercial property \u2013 is invested in commercial property funds, which offer private investors a chance to gain exposure to huge office block developments and shopping centres. M&amp;G\u2019s fund has invested in properties including New Square Park, a 250-acre office park near Heathrow airport, and the eight-storey 3 Hardman Square office block in Manchester; while Aviva holds sites including 20 Soho Square development in central London and the Guildhall shopping centre in Exeter. Andrew Bailey, the newly installed chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, said the current situation \u201cpoints to issues that we need to look at in the design of these things\u201d and insisted there was no cause for panic. Bailey\u2019s comments came as the FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK-focused companies compared with the FTSE 100, closed down 382.02 points, or 2.37%, to 15,734.68. City commentators also queued up to warn of further woe for the commercial property sector, predicting that other funds would be compelled to temporarily prevent withdrawals. Simon French, chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said: \u201cCommercial real estate looked very vulnerable as we entered the referendum with most finance directors thinking the stuff was overpriced before Brexit. Add that to the fact that material changes to immigration and market access will affect prime office space occupants and a financial sector most correlated to GDP slowdown, then this looks like a perfect storm.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown, added that banning investors from redemptions could happen to any of the funds. \u201cWe have now had two in very short succession. It suggests that we are on the cusp of others.\u201d Khalaf added that around 10% of a fund\u2019s asset value tended to be held in cash and that funds selling off their assets would inevitably put pressure on commercial property prices across the UK. However, Bailey called for calm and said that the suspension of the funds should not been seen as a panic measure. \u201cIt\u2019s designed into these structures to deal precisely with that situation where there\u2019s been some shock to the market, if you like, and there\u2019s a presumption of a valuation adjustment which is quite hard to capture in illiquid assets at high frequency,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the purpose of the suspension is to create a pause, if you like, to allow that process then to happen. And that\u2019s sensible, it\u2019s absolutely sensible.\u201d Other analysts played down fears of a rerun of the 2009 crisis when commercial property prices plunged and banks were left nursing heavy losses on their loans. Eduardo Gorab, a property economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cClearly, the uncertainty kicked up by the referendum\u2019s result has had an adverse impact on sentiment, which has been driving outflows over the last week or two. \u201cHowever, if we are right in thinking that occupier and investment markets are well placed to weather the uncertainty, we suspect that fears of a repeat of 2009 are overdone.\u201d The Bank of England has already subjected banks to tests to ensure they can sustain a 30% fall in commercial property prices and will impose tests on them again this year. However, the Bank said that there could be wider fallout from declines in commercial property prices. This is because 75% of small business loans are secured against property while banks also use such loans to count towards their capital buffers. In its biannual assessment of financial risks, the Bank said it was \u201cfocused on the potential for adjustments in the commercial real estate market to be amplified and affect economic activity by reducing the ability of companies that use commercial real estate as collateral to access finance. Any adjustment could potentially be amplified by the behaviour of leveraged investors and investors in open-ended funds.\u201d Around 45% of commercial property is funded by foreign investment although there has been a 50% reduction in such investment in the first quarter of the year, the Bank of England said. Although there is no technical link between commercial property prices and residential property, house market experts have warned that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU will affect demand and valuations for residential property in the coming months. Foxtons, the London-focused estate agent, issued a profit warning in the wake of the EU poll as it predicted that the capital\u2019s property market will remain depressed for the rest of the year.",

Here\u2019s a flavour: The fallout from the Brexit vote reverberated through the markets on Tuesday as two more City property funds barred investors from withdrawing their cash and the Bank of England warned that risks to the financial system had begun to \u201ccrystallise\u201d. City watchers warned that further property funds would be forced to bar withdrawals as investors race for the door amid fears of a plunge in the values of office blocks and shopping centres in post Brexit Britain.

The Bank of England easing regulations on banks to allow them to release up to \u00a3150bn worth of loans to households and businesses. Chancellor George Osborne held a summit with the heads of the major high street banks, who pledged to avoid a new credit crisis by making loans available. Here\u2019s the full tale: The City is now closed for the night, so I\u2019m going to wrap up. Here are our latest stories on the property fund freeze, and the Bank of England\u2019s attempts to calm the Brexit crisis. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Although the UK property sector is undoubtedly in a serious situation, it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re careering into a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Jason Holland, managing director of City advisers Tilney Bestinvest, explains that it\u2019s different this time, partly because the Bank of England has been so proactive: The uncertainty around Brexit is undoubtedly a challenge for the property sector but this is not a post Lehman Brothers style moment when the whole financial system faced collapse and the supply of credit - key to property transactions - was in doubt. The Bank of England has set out its readiness to provide vast amounts of liquidity and interest rates look set to be cut. Talk is moving decisively in favour of a pro-growth rather than a tax hiking Budget. The stock market has weathered Brexit bettered than many predicted and successful corporate bond issues this week from British American Tobacco and Brown Forman (the producers of Jack Daniels) suggest the Sterling credit market remains open for business. The Brexit crisis has been causing angst across the global economy, with investors worried that it could hurt world economic growth.

There she goes! The pound has just slid to the $1.300 mark for the first time in over three decades, having shed 2% today. Here\u2019s a list of the biggest property funds in the UK, kindly provided by Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown: M&amp;G Property Portfolio \u00a34255.0m *REDEMPTIONS SUSPENDED TODAY* Henderson UK Property \u00a33477.2m Aberdeen UK Property \u00a33424.2m Standard Life UK Real Estate \u00a32911m *REDEMPTIONS SUSPENDED YESTERDAY* Legal &amp; General UK Property \u00a32494.7m Aviva Investment Property Trust \u00a31842.4m *REDEMPTIONS SUSPENDED TODAY* BlackRock Global Property Securities Equity Tracker \u00a31053.7m Schroder Global Real Estate Securities \u00a3588.3m Kames Sterling Property Income \u00a3500.8m Royal London Property \u00a3402m Laith adds a word of caution: some of these funds invest in shares of property companies, which are obviously easier to sell than actual offices and shops. The pound is now hitting fresh 31-year lows.... and getting close to the $1.3000 mark for the first time since 1985. So, what happens next? Well, one hedge fund expert has tweeted that investors will now be anxiously wondering which funds might be frozen next, and getting their money out: Sometimes, though, it can be best to sit and wait: FOHF = fund of hedge funds, an investment vehicle which puts money into various hedge funds. It\u2019s been another grim day in the markets.... unless you\u2019re the FTSE 100, which has closed 0.3% higher. A good reminder that the Footsie, which is packed with international companies, is not the best barometer of the UK economy. M&amp;G\u2019s property fund owns an office block near Heathrow airport, several shopping centres, and a bunch of warehouses in Northampton. NEWSFLASH: M&amp;G has now suspended its property fund after experiencing a surge of withdrawal requests. And like Standard Life and Aviva, M&amp;G blames the Brexit uncertainty for driving investors to the exits (which are now locked) This is significant, as M&amp;G\u2019s is the biggest property fund in the UK. Here\u2019s the statement from M&amp;G, which is part of Prudential: M&amp;G SUSPENDS TRADING IN M&amp;G PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AMID BREXIT UNCERTAINTY London, 5th July 2016 - M&amp;G Investments (M&amp;G) announces a temporary suspension of trading in the shares of the M&amp;G Property Portfolio and its feeder fund. Investor redemptions in the Fund have risen markedly because of the high levels of uncertainty in the UK commercial property market since the outcome of the European Union referendum. Redemptions have now reached a point where M&amp;G believes it can best protect the interests of the funds\u2019 shareholders by seeking a temporary suspension in trading. This will allow the fund manager time to raise cash levels in a controlled manner, ensuring that any asset disposals are achieved at reasonable values. The decision to suspend was taken in agreement with the Fund\u2019s Depositary and the Financial Conduct Authority has been informed. Orders placed after 12pm on 4th July 2016 will not be processed until the suspension is lifted. M&amp;G will review the suspension every 28 days. The Property Portfolio is a broadly diversified fund which invests in 178 UK commercial properties across retail, industrial and office sectors on behalf of UK retail investors. The Fund, which managed assets of \u00a34.4 billion as at 30 June 2016, has no borrowings. To help anyone just tuning in, here\u2019s a quick recap of the key points today: Aviva, the UK investment group, has become the second company to suspend withdrawals from its property fund, following the Brexit vote. Aviva followed Standard Life, which shuttered its fund last night after experiencing a wave of redemption requests from nervous investors. It\u2019s the latest signal that last month\u2019s EU referendum result is now hitting confidence in the UK economy. An Aviva spokesperson blamed \u201cextraordinary market circumstances\u201d, adding that freezing the fund will protect all investors. Suspension of dealing will give Aviva Investors greater control in managing cashflows and conducting orderly asset sales in order to meet our obligations to investors wishing to redeem their holdings.\u201d Otherwise, it would have been forced to start selling its assets (which include supermarkets and offices across the UK) to raise funds. Analysts believe other funds will come under pressure too, if investors begin to worry that commercial property values are going to tumble in the aftermath of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. The move came just a couple of hours after the Bank of England took new steps to tackle the consequences of the Brexit vote. Britain\u2019s central bank relaxed the capital rules imposed on UK lenders, meaning firms and households will get access to an extra \u00a3150bn of potential credit. Banks, who met with chancellor George Osborne today, have just announced that they will make the extra capital available to the real economy. But Bank governor Mark Carney also issued a warning that the risks around Brexit are now \u2018starting to crystallise\u2019, \u201cThe UK has entered a period of uncertainty and significant economic adjustment. The efforts of the Bank of England will not be able fully and immediately to offset the market and economic volatility that can be expected while this adjustment proceeds.\u201d Carney also urged borrowers to be prudent, and warned that Britain\u2019s current account deficit with the rest of the world was a key risk in the post-Brexit world, as foreign investors may lose faith in the UK. Earlier, new economic data showed that UK service sector growth slowed last month. Fresh fears over Brexit are gripping the markets again. The pound has been rocked, hitting a new 31-year low around $1.305 against the US dollar. And the FTSE 250 index, which includes many small UK firms, is currently down 2.1% today. My colleague Jill Treanor has rattled out a Q&amp;A about Aviva and Standard Chartered\u2019s decision to block investors from cashing out of their property trusts. Here\u2019s a flavour: What are commercial property funds? They are funds that allow people to invest in commercial property developments such as office blocks and shopping centres \u2013 projects that normally rely on money from major professional investors. How much money is invested in them? Around \u00a335bn, around 7% of the total investment in UK commercial property, is invested in these property funds. Could this affect the residential property market? It is not immediately clear how this this feeds through into residential properties, although a hit to sentiment in the commercial property industry can quickly feed through to homebuyers, who might decide to pull out of transactions. The Bank of England is concerned that if these funds all seize up at once that it could amplify any fall in commercial property prices.... Could this affect the broader UK economy? Around75% of small businesses use commercial property as collateral for loans so they could face problems with their banks if prices fall too sharply. Banks also use commercial property to count towards their capital buffers; around 55% of their core capital \u2013 their main safety net in a crisis -\u2013 at the end of 2015 was based on commercial property.... More here: Earlier today, JP Morgan gave a pithy warning of the dangers of Brexit: Investors are bailing out of Britain\u2019s building and property companies today, as evidence mounts that Brexit fears are now hitting the sector. Housebuilders Barratt, Taylor Wimpey and Berkeley Group are leading the fallers on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, down around 6% each. The FTSE 100 is still up a bit, thanks to the plunge in the pound (which helps big exporters). But Mark Carney told us this morning to watch the smaller FTSE 250 index instead, to see what the City really thinks about the UK economy. And that index has fallen by 2.5% this morning. Two challenger banks, Shawbrook and Virgin Money, have tumbled by 12% each. they are both acutely sensitive to UK consumer confidence, and spending. According to investment site Trustnet, the Aviva Property Trust holds commercial property assets across the UK. Roughly a third of its assets were in London and the South East (as of 31 May), including offices in the centre of the capital. It also owns shopping centres in Edinburgh, Manchester and Exeter, and offices in Birmingham. It will also have invested in shares of UK property companies, which have fallen sharply since the referendum. Here\u2019s our news story about Aviva locking down its UK property fund to prevent investors selling up, after the Brexit vote. Other property funds will probably come under pressure to follow Aviva and Standard Life\u2019s lead, if their customers decide to pull money out. Emma Bewley, head of funds at Connection Capital in London, told Bloomberg that: The potential impact of a high-profile liquid fund suspending redemptions shouldn\u2019t be underestimated, particularly given the uncertain environment. While asset managers will seek to avoid suspending redemptions, they may have to use additional liquidity facilities. Aviva has suspended redemptions from its property fund just three hours after the Bank of England spelt out the potential implications of such funds to the overall market. In its half-yearly assessment of risks to the financial markets, the Bank flagged up that: \u201cSince the referendum, share prices of UK real estate investment trust have fallen sharply, highlighting the risk of future adjustments in commercial retail estate prices. It then warned that: \u201cAny adjustment in commercial real estate markets could be amplified by the behaviour of leveraged investors and investors in open-ended commercial property funds. Any such amplification of market adjustments could affect economic activity by reducing the ability of companies that use commercial real state as collateral to access finance\u201d These funds account for 7% - or around \u00a335bn - of the investment in commercial property, and had already experienced significant outflows before the referendum. Commercial property prices matter because around 55% of their core capital bases are aligned to the loans in the sector and 75% of small businesses use commercial property as collateral for loans. It is the smaller banks which have greater exposure, the Bank said, after the major players reduced their exposure after the 2008 crisis. The Bank pointed out it had conducted stress tests in 2014 and 2015 on the major lenders to assume a 30% fall in property prices. Its own staff have calculated that for every 10% fall in commercial property prices there is a 1% fall in wider economic investment. The Financial Times has some good early reaction to Aviva\u2019s move: Mike Prew, analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that further funds would halt redemptions in a \u201cvicious circle of value destruction\u201d that would also affect listed real estate investment trusts. A fund manager who monitors flows across the market said that outflows since the vote had been driven by discretionary wealth managers moving large chunks of investors\u2019 money into other asset classes. More here: Aviva becomes second UK property fund to halt redemptions Aviva and Standard Life are trying to protect the interests of all investors in their property funds by refusing to allow clients to take money out. Otherwise, they would be forced to sell property assets at firesale prices to fund redemption requests. That would drive down the value of the fund, encouraging more investors to cash out, creating a vicious circle. Instead, people with money in these funds must now sit and wait. The pound hasn\u2019t been this weak since September 1985: It has shed almost 2 cents today. Global traders are baulking at the news that two UK property trusts (so far) are now refusing to allow investors to pull their money out: Hat-tip to Giles Wilkes of the FT for the chart skills. Correction... the pound has actually fallen through $1.31 (so i\u2019ve updated that last entry). Aviva\u2019s decision to suspend its property trust has sent the pound reeling to a new 31-year low. Sterling slumped to $1.3098 against the US dollar, down 1.8 cents, to a level not seen since 1985. NEWSFLASH: Aviva, the savings and investment group, has suspended redemptions from its \u00a31.8bn property fund. It took the decision following the Brexit vote, which triggered a surge of requests from investors to pull their money out of its UK Property Trust. That\u2019s because the EU referendum could hurt the property sector, driving down the value of office blocks, supermarkets and factories. Aviva blamed \u201cextraordinary market circumstances\u201d, a day after Standard Life became the first firm to freeze its property fund. An Aviva spokesperson said: \u201cWe have acted to safeguard the interests of all our investors by suspending dealing in the fund with immediate effect. \u201cSuspension of dealing will give Aviva Investors greater control in managing cashflows and conducting orderly asset sales in order to meet our obligations to investors wishing to redeem their holdings.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City firm Hargreaves Lansdown, reckons more investment firms will freeze redemptions soon. \u2018The dominos are starting to fall in the UK commercial property market, as yet another fund locks its doors on the back of outflows precipitated by the Brexit vote. It\u2019s probably only a matter of time before we see other funds follow suit. George Osborne has repeated his support for Mark Carney\u2019s decision to ease the funding rules, allowing banks to lend more. He\u2019s told Sky News that the government\u2019s financial reforms, making the banks \u2018part of the solution in the UK economy, not part of the problem\u2019 are paying off. Economics professor David Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policymaker, has given Mark Carney full marks for today\u2019s performance: Resigning from high office (or not-so-high office) is in fashion this summer. So it\u2019s nice to see one senior official actually knuckling down and doing his job. Today\u2019s press conference had one key message \u2013 Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from the Brexit vote (as predicted), and its central bankers are on the case. 1) Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that the risks posed by the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership have \u201cbegun to crystallise\u201d, and posing new dangers to the economy. Presenting the BoE\u2019s latest financial stability report, Carney said: The UK has entered a period of uncertainty and significant economic adjustment. The efforts of the Bank of England will not be able fully and immediately to offset the market and economic volatility that can be expected while this adjustment proceeds.\u201d 2) The BoE isn\u2019t sitting on its hands. Slashing the \u2018counter-cyclical capital reserves\u2019 will help banks to pump \u00a3150bn of extra lending into the economy. But Carney also warned that this will only work if businesses and individuals actually want to borrow. And despite the slide in the pound (which could help exporters), there are clear signs that the the economy is slowing. 3) Prudence used to be a Gordon Brown favourite, before the former chancellor and PM was engulfed by the financial crisis of 2007-08. But she has a new friend today. Asked for his advice to the UK, Carney declared that people must remain prudent: If you are taking out a mortgage, at some stage, during the life of that mortgage, conditions will be difficult. So you want to be sure, as a household or an individual, that you can repay that mortgage - you don\u2019t want to lose your house or flat. 4) The bank is watching closely for signs that Britain\u2019s most indebted households are struggling post-Brexit vote. There could be casualties out there... We have been concerned for some time about these issues,the interplay between high levels of household indebtedness and the housing market and the possibility that there will be more vulnerable households.\u201d 5) Carney reiterated that Britain\u2019s financial sector is in much better shape than before the financial crisis, so we should avoid another credit crunch. The core of this system is very strong, we may see some volatility, we may see things move around, but the system is going to be there for someone who wants to buy a house or a business person with a viable plan.\u201d 6) ....but the same can\u2019t be said of the current account deficit, which has widened to record levels. Carney warned that a weaker pound won\u2019t magically solve Britain\u2019s balance of payments woes (the fact we import more than we export). The danger is that overseas investors now shun the UK. In the governor\u2019s words: In and of itself, the movement in sterling should be beneficial for the current account. But... the pace of investment will also be quite important in terms of where the balance is going over time. 7) Carney has little time for those who point to the recovery in the FTSE 100 index (now above its pre-vote levels). It\u2019s better to look at the index of smaller firms, the FTSE 250 index, he says: \u201cIn terms of the equity markets I would focus a little bit more on the domestically-focused stock, the FTSE 250 or the component of FTSE 100 that is principally serving this economy. 8) Politics is for politicians. Carney was long rumoured to fancy a shift to Canadian politics, before a certain Justin Trudeau took the Liberal party to victory. Today he faces criticism from Leave campaigners, who will have their hands on (or at least near) the levers of power in the UK. But the governor brushed them aside, saying the Bank will keep doing its job and work with whoever is in power. Last question goes to my colleague Nils Pratley. He asks Mark Carney about the criticism piled on the Bank from Leave campaigners such as Andrea Leadsom (now in the running to become prime minister). Carney replies that \u201cwe\u2019re not asking people to make our lives easier\u201d This is a technocratic institution. We\u2019ll work with whoever is in government. In short, the Bank will keep sticking to its remit, publishing the reports expected under its remit. And that includes flagging up threats to the UK economy. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: Could the Bank of England really ease monetary policy much lower - some economists suggest new quantitative easing (buying bonds with new money) wouldn\u2019t have much impact? Carney declines to comment on monetary policy \u2013 as today\u2019s meeting is about financial stability. Q: Is the Bank of England worried about the prospect of Scotland breaking away from the UK? That\u2019s a double hypothetical, Carney says - there\u2019s no 2nd referendum yet, let alone a decision. Back to the Bank of England press conference: Q: What discussions have you had with other central banks about the referendum? We have had close contact with them, Carney replies, especially in the run-up to the vote. This was effective in building mutual understanding of the risks posed by Brexit, he says. He points to the \u2018currency swaps\u2019 which allows central banks to share dollars, euros, pounds, yen etc with each other. And the global economy faces \u2018notable\u2019 spillovers, he adds. UK chancellor George Osborne has welcomed the BoE\u2019s decision to ease bank capital rules. He also reveals that major bank bosses are heading to his offices this morning, to discuss the crisis The decision to cut the counter-cyclical capital buffers is one of several Brexit u-turns, tweets The Sun\u2019s political editor: Hang on, though, didn\u2019t The Sun back Brexit??!! Some key points from Mark Carney\u2019s briefing: Q: Does the Bank of England actually have the capacity to handle Britain\u2019s exit from the EU? Mark Carney insists that yes, the BoE has the staff capacity to cope once Article 50 is triggered. But until that actually happens, the financial rules do not change. Q: How worried is the Bank about Standard Life\u2019s decision to lock down its property fund last night? (to prevent investors bailing out) Andrew Bailey, the next head of the FCA (the city watchdog), says Standard Life has taken a \u2018sensible move\u2019 to suspend redemptions. It prevents a stampede of money out of property funds while the underlying assets are revalued (which can take time). It would be wrong for investors at the front of the queue to get their money back, while those at the back lose out, Bailey says. The FCA is also in \u201cvery close touch\u201d with firms in the sector, he reveals. Q: How low could the Bank of England cut interest rates (they\u2019re currently 0.5%)? Carney declines to speculate much, as the Monetary Policy Committee is due to take a decision next week. Any measure to stimulate the economy must be well-aimed and focus on the domestic economy. We must also consider \u2018unintended consequences\u2019, he adds. [ultra-low interest rates make it hard for banks to achieve profitability, for example] Q: What impact will the slump in the pound have on the UK economy? Mark Carney says that it should help with Britain\u2019s current account deficit (reminder, it\u2019s worryingly high) Q: What is your advice to people who are wondering about taking out a loan or mortgage, asks our Jill Treanor? We are advising people to be prudent, governor Carney smiles. If you are taking out a mortgage, at some stage, during the life of that mortgage, conditions will be difficult. So you want to be sure, as a household or an individual, that you can repay that mortgage - you don\u2019t want to lose your house or flat. But this is classic central bank advice, he adds. We\u2019d tell you to be prudent if we were in the 10th year of a boom (whenever THAT happens) Carney says the Bank wants to avoid a repeat of the 2007-2008 conditions, when it was out of question to seek credit. Q: Do you regret allowing banks to pay dividends in the run-up to June\u2019s referendum? Mark Carney insists that UK banks are financially stable. Q: How many UK households are vulnerable to an economic slowdown? Carney flips this question to deputy governor Jon Cunliffe. Cunliffe says the Bank are watching the \u2018cohort\u2019 of vulnerable households closely. Households who are highly indebted tend to cut their consumption drastically, when hit by an interest rate shock or earnings shock, Cunliffe says. But the Bank did restrict the availability of high loan-to-value mortgages in 2014, to limit the number of highly vulnerable households, he adds. Q: Is the Bank worried about a crash in the buy-to-let market? Carney says the Bank is watching the buy-to-let sector carefully. He points out that the bank included a housing crash in its latest Stress Tests -- and the current environment is not a serious as modelled in those tests. The core of the UK financial system is very strong, and it will be there for home-buyers and businesses, he insists. Q: Is the Bank seeing signs of a slowdown in credit demand? Carney says this is a crucial point -- the credit market will be driven by demand, not supply. We are seeing signs that the environment is becoming more \u2018risk averse\u2019, he says. And that\u2019s why the Bank has decided to relax credit rules, to encourage banks to lend. But demand for credit will be governed by the level of uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future, and its relationship with the EU. Q: The Monetary Policy Committee warned that Britain might fall into recession after a Brexit vote, but might the fall in the pound actually be a stimulus? Carney replies that there is \u201cgrowing evidence\u201d that the economy was slowing, even before the referendum. And it is probably experiencing a \u201cmaterial slowing\u201d, despite the foreign exchange moves. Onto questions Q: The FTSE 100 has recovered its early post-Brexit falls and the pound has stabilised, so aren\u2019t markets less stressed than feared? Mark Carney replies that markets are functioning \u201cpretty well\u201d, although sterling volatility did hit a record high. He says sterling has moved in the way that was \u201cnecessary\u201d to allow the economic adjustment that is needed. [by which he means that a cheaper pound should help exporters and cut imports, in theory.....] Governor Carney adds that the FTSE 250 index gives a sense of investor expectations on the direction of the economy. [The FTSE 250, which contains smaller companies, has fallen much more than the FTSE 100, and is down 2.6% today] Mark Carney says there will be no immediate changes to UK financial regulations, until Britain has actually left the EU. The law is the law, and the rules are the rules. He is pledging to take whatever action is needed ensure monetary stability, and support the real economy. But the Bank can only do so much..... Mark Carney confirms that the Bank of England has decided to cut the \u2018counter-cyclical capital buffer\u2019 on UK banks. This means banks need to keep less capital on their books, and can pump up to \u00a3150bn more into the economy. This will \u201cimmediately\u201d give banks greater flexibility to lend to UK businesses and households, declares the BoE governor. He adds: Those businesses and households who want to seize viable opportunities in the post-Brexit world can be confident that they will be supported by the financial sector. Carney also declares that regulators will make sure that banks don\u2019t use this flexibility to boost bonus payments, or dividends. Mark Carney begins his press conference by reminding us that the Bank identified the referendum as the biggest threat to the UK economy. That warning is now being borne out, the governor says, pointing to the plunge in the pound since June 23rd. He singles out UK\u2019s current account deficit (as mentioned a few minutes ago). There is growing evidence that the referendum has delayed major investment decisions, Carney adds. But on the upside, financial markets have responded well to the volatility after the referendum result, rather than adding to stress. And banks are much better capitalised than before the Lehman crisis. The Financial Stability Report press conference is beginning now. We\u2019ve added a live feed to the top of this blog - you might need to refresh to see it. Alternatively, It\u2019s also being livestreamed here (right-click to open in a new tab). You can see the report yourself, here: Financial Stability Report, July 2016 More snap reaction: The Bank of England is also concerned about the United Kingdom\u2019s large current account deficit, following the Brexit vote. This deficit, between what Britain imports and exports, is \u201chigh by historical and international standards\u201d, says the Bank. Indeed.... --&gt; The Bank is worried that the flow of capital into the UK could now slow, making this deficit even bigger.... The financing of the deficit is reliant on continuing material inflows of portfolio and foreign direct investment, which have been used to finance the public sector deficit and corporate investment, including in commercial real estate. A sudden shift in the supply of foreign capital and in the current account deficit would be associated with a sharp increase in risk premia and adjustment in sterling. The BoE also points out the pound suffered a record fall after the referendum vote: . The Bank of England has also warned Britain\u2019s banks not to splurge cash on payments to shareholders, or bonuses to staff: Newsflash from London: Britain\u2019s central bank has warned that the risks posed by the Brexit vote are \u201cstarting to crystallise\u201d. In it latest financial stability report, just released, the Bank of England warns that: \u201cThere is evidence that some risks have begun to crystallise. The current outlook for UK financial stability is challenging,\u201d The BoE has also taken action to fight the looming threat of recession, by relaxing the capital control rules on UK banks. That is meant to encourage lenders to keep providing credit to the UK economy. Back in March, the BoE has announced that the so-called counter-cyclical capital buffer would rise to 0.5%. It has now reversed that decision, potentially freeing up an extra \u00a3150bn for lending, the BoE said. And the Bank also pledged to do more to help the economy, saying: \u201cThe Financial Policy Committee stands ready to take actions that will ensure that capital and liquidity buffers can be drawn on as needed, to support the supply of credit and in support of market functioning.\u201d We\u2019ll hear more from governor Mark Carney at 11am. In five minutes, the Bank of England will publish its latest Financial Stability report...and may just announce some measures to prop up the UK economy (as explained earlier) Mark Priest of ETX Capital says Standard Life\u2019s decision to freeze its property fund last night has spooked the City, and helped to drive down the pound. Standard Life\u2019s decision to close redemptions on its open-ended property fund is vitally important and shows just how precarious the situation is right now. This seems to have precipitated some pretty big selling in property stocks and asset managers, with Legal &amp; General and Aberdeen Asset Management suffering nasty falls this morning. Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey are down 5% again. Investors are getting very nervous now as they fear Standard Life may not be the only fund that will close its doors. The last time we saw this kind of action was in the financial crisis. Bad news for British holidaymakers....sterling has also hit a two-and-a-half-year low against the euro, at \u20ac1.1787. The last time the pound was this low, in 1985, David Bowie and Mick Jagger were topping the charts with Dancing In The Streets. If the pound loses another cent, we\u2019ll be back to 1984 levels, when Frankie Goes To Hollywood were encouraging the nation to Relax. Click on this tweet to see more.... Boom! The pound just hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar. Sterling slumped by 1.5 cents to $1.3113 following the news that UK service sector growth was hit by Brexit angst last month. That\u2019s below the levels hit after the referendum vote, and back to the sterling crisis of the mid-1980s. Analysts are concerned that growth in Britain\u2019s dominant services sector slowed last month, but relieved that it didn\u2019t actually contract: Economist Rupert Seggins has helpfully put the service sector report into context: Breaking! Growth in Britain\u2019s service sector has hit a joint-38-month low, indicating that economic growth has slowed. Data firm Markit reports the UK\u2019s services companies suffered a fall in new business last month. And employment rose at the slowest rate since August 2013. It\u2019s the latest sign that Brexit uncertainty has hurt the economy, even before the vote itself (89% of the survey was conducted before June 24) Markit reports: Growth over the second quarter as a whole was the weakest since the first quarter of 2013 when the current upturn began. Moreover, the 12-month outlook was the darkest since December 2012. Companies often reported that uncertainty linked to the EU referendum had weighed on workloads and incoming new business. This dragged the service sector PMI down to 52.3 in June, down from 53.5 in May. That matches April\u2019s 38-month low and signals a relatively weak rate of growth in UK services output. On the upside, it\u2019s still above the 50-point figure that splits expansion from contraction (yesterday, the construction PMI plunged to just 46) But....it suggests Britain\u2019s economy weakened in the last three months. And there could be worse to come. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, explains: \u201cThe PMI surveys indicate that the pace of UK economic growth slowed to just 0.2% in the second quarter, with a further loss of momentum in June as Brexit anxiety intensified. \u201cHiring has also clearly been hit as firms lack clarity on the economic outlook. Business optimism in the vast service sector is down to a three-and-a-half-year low. \u201cA further slowing, and possible contraction, looks highly likely in coming months as a result of the uncertainty created by the EU referendum. Shares in UK property firms are sliding this morning. Investors are racing for the hills, after Standard Life froze redemptions from its \u00a32.9bn property fund last night following a surge of redemption requests after the Brexit vote. Building firms Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley Group and Barratt Developments are all down 6%. Persimmon are close behind (-5.7%) despite telling the City this morning that it is still confidence about its prospects. Land Securities, one of the UK\u2019s largest commercial property owners, has fallen 5%. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says \u201cthe mood has soured again\u201d. The announcement that fund manager Standard Life had stopped retail investors from pulling out of one of the largest UK property funds is one catalyst for the downturn in sentiment, though not the only one. Concerns about Italian banks are growing, too. Just in....growth in Europe\u2019s service sector slowed last month, as firms watched Britain head to the polls in the EU referendum. The eurozone services PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has fallen to 52.8 in June, down from 53.3 in May. That\u2019s the lowest reading since January 2015. Germany had another good month, with its services sector PMI rising to 53.7 from 53.2. Italy\u2019s service sector returned to growth, with the PMI jumping to 51.9 from 49.8. But France\u2019s private sector contracted again. And if you factor in the latest manufacturing data, you see that growth has dropped to its weakest level since the last quarter of 2014: Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears the eurozone economy is faltering. \u201cThe eurozone economy failed to gain momentum in June, rounding off a disappointing second quarter. Faster manufacturing growth was countered by a slowdown in the service sector, leaving the overall pace of expansion of business activity unchanged since May. \u201cThe survey is signalling GDP growth of just 0.3%, similar to the sluggish trend recorded over the past year. The data suggest that the strong upturn seen in the official GDP data at the start of the year will have overstated the underlying health of the economy, and that growth will have slowed in the second quarter. And that\u2019s before the Brexit shock.... Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency trading firm World First, agrees that Mark Carney is likely to relax capital rules today, following the Brexit vote. But he also fears that banks might not lend more to customers. Here\u2019s why: Mark Carney\u2019s Bank of England is expected to flex the muscles of their newest counter-cyclical capital buffer today and lower the levels of capital banks are forced to hold in their coffers. This should allow banks to increase the volume of loans they\u2019re extending to the private sector as they look to put the capital to work which, in turn, supports the credit markets and small businesses reliant on bank funding. However, history isn\u2019t particularly supportive of this theory. Mervyn King\u2019s Bank of England had a torrid time trying to get UK banks to issue credit for one key reason \u2013 the demand for loans simply wasn\u2019t there. In times of political and economic uncertainty, appetite for credit among SMEs falls through the floor, and understandably so. Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts reckons the markets look pretty edgy, given the drops on the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250. Nervous investors are piling into the Swiss government debt this morning, in their search for a safe haven. They have driven prices to record highs. And amazingly, the yield on 50-year Swiss debt is now negative -- meaning investors are paying for the chance to lend to Bern until 2066! All is not well out there..... European stock markets are falling in early trading, as investors fret about the global economy. The French and German indices are both down around 1%. London\u2019s FTSE 100 is only down 0.3%, thanks to the weakening pound (which helps internationally-focused firms). But the smaller FTSE 250 has lost 1.8% in early trading, following a 2% slide yesterday. Confidence among British businesses fell sharply following the vote to leave the European Union, according to a new survey. Almost 50% of firms are now pessimistic about the UK economy, the survey by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research found. That\u2019s up from 25% before the referendum. It suggests that Britain has suffered \u201ca significant shock reaction (to Brexit),\u201d according to Scott Corfe, director at Cebr. He adds: \u201cNot only are businesses feeling much more pessimistic in general about the state of the economy, but their own expectations for domestic sales, exports and investments over the next 12 months have gone off a cliff.\u201d This will alarm the Bank of England, and encourage policymakers to consider measure to prevent the UK falling into recession. The pound is dropping in early trading, as investors await the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report. Sterling has dropped by over one cent, to $1.3174 against the US dollar. That\u2019s not far from the 31-year low plumbed after the Brexit vote ($1.3118 is the magic number). In theory, a weak pound is good for exporters -- but only if demand for their products isn\u2019t dented by a global downturn. And it won\u2019t fix the UK economy\u2019s underlying weaknesses.... Cometh the hour, cometh the man, again?.... With Brexit fears gripping Britain\u2019s economy, the public and the City are crying out for guidance and help. So as Westminster is rather pre-occupied by leadership contests, the responsibility will fall to Bank of England governor Mark Carney today. The BoE will released its latest Financial Stability report at 10.30am this morning, assessing the state of the UK\u2019s economy. It looks rather more unstable than two weeks ago, of course, since the EU referendum vote turned politics on its head, and put business confidence on its knees. Then at 11am, Carney will hold a press conference to explain the Bank\u2019s thinking, and any new measures it is taking to tackle the crisis. This will be Carney\u2019s second set piece event in a week; last Thursday, he all-but promised interest rate cuts and more stimulus measures this summer. So what could he do today? The Bank could choose to relax the capital rules imposed on banks, to give them more leeway to handle the fallout from Brexit. That would be a symbolic move to ease pressures on the City; it\u2019s only six months since the BoE tightened those rules, which are meant to protect us from a financial crisis. Carney could also signal that more credit will be thrown at the economy, by beefing up the existing Funding for Lending. That would also help to prevent a credit crunch clogging up the economy. Here\u2019s our preview: There are already signs that last month\u2019s referendum is having a damaging impact on the economy. As we liveblogged last night, Standard Life has been forced to stop investors withdrawing from its real estate fund, after being deluged by redemption requests. That may herald some nasty times in the property sector.... Also coming up today.... We get a flurry of economic data today, showing how service sector companies in the UK, the eurozone and America performed in June. Analysts will be looking for signs that the Brexit crisis hit growth, after some shockingly weak construction data yesterday 9am BST: Eurozone service sector PMI 9.30am BST: UK services sector PMI 2.45pm BST: US ISM service sector report 3pm BST: US factory orders. And in the City, building firm Persimmon and brewery chain Young &amp; Co are reporting results.",

The European commission wants tax authorities to be able to identify the real owners of offshore funds in an attempt to stop individuals and companies avoiding tax by hiding money and assets in opaque companies and offshore trusts. The EU executive has also promised a robust new law to clamp down on lawyers and tax advisers helping clients stash money in offshore islands, although details remain sketchy. The EU recently agreed measures to compel big companies to disclose their earnings and tax bills after a public outcry about multinationals using legal loopholes to lower their taxes. But following the leak of 11.5m files exposing the tax secrets of the global elite, EU officials extended their focus to tax havens. \u201cThe recent leaks exposed loopholes that still allow tax evaders to hide funds offshore,\u201d said Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of tax policy, as he announced the plans on Tuesday. \u201cThese loopholes must be closed and our measures to stamp out tax abuse must be intensified.\u201d In future, national tax authorities will exchange information about individuals and companies behind a trust, which is already collected under EU anti-money laundering rules. As well as strengthening transparency, the commission has promised to clamp down on lawyers and tax advisers who come up with elaborate tax avoidance schemes. The French tax commissioner promised to publish \u201crobust EU rules to hold tax advisers to account\u201d before his mandate ends in 2019, with a public consultation to start \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Existing international rules on tax advisers were rather unspecific, Moscovici said, adding that he hoped that EU law would be \u201can inspiration to our international partners\u201d. The plans are part of a broader package of measures to stop money laundering and terrorist financing. Other measures would give authorities more oversight over Bitcoin and equivalents in a bid to stop virtual currencies being used by terrorists and criminals. Judith Sargentini, a Dutch Green member of the European parliament, welcomed the fact that the commission was \u201cgrasping the nettle and trying to strengthen EU anti-money laundering rules in response to the Panama Papers revelations\u201d. She said: \u201cThe commission has set out a number of crucial measures but the proposals lack the necessary enforcement measures to make sure the rules are implemented and have a deterrent effect.\u201d The Panama Papers showed that \u201cexisting rules are being widely flouted \u2026 this shortcoming must be addressed\u201d. The MEP, who will be one of the parliament\u2019s lead negotiators in redrafting the EU\u2019s anti-money laundering law, called on the commission to publish a law targeted at professionals \u201cfacilitating tax dodging\u201d as soon as possible. Transparency campaigners gave the proposals a mixed review. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see the commission recognises that transparency is vital to end the system of secrecy which helps allow the corrupt to hide their stolen cash,\u201d said Laure Brillaud, at Transparency International\u2019s EU office. But the campaign group said major loopholes remained, because registration requirements will only apply to trustees based in EU member states. \u201cOnce again the commission has stopped short of full transparency around trusts,\u201d said Brillaud. \u201cThis is a bold step by the commission but it\u2019s not the brave leap needed to end this system of secrecy which fuels impunity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The first element in the Bank of England\u2019s post-Brexit operation was obvious. Banks will be told to use their capital buffers for the purpose for which they were intended \u2013 to absorb shocks. It will have required no genius, or even lateral thinking, on the part of the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee to reach this decision. The financial system established after the crisis of 2008-09 is designed to flex in emergencies. An emergency \u2013 in the form of \u201cchallenging\u201d financial conditions and a possible drought in foreign capital heading to the UK \u2013 has materialised. So pull the appropriate lever. Nor should one be sniffy about the significance of the Bank\u2019s manoeuvre. Reducing banks\u2019 countercyclical capital buffers from 0.5% to 0% may sound a modest tweak but the effect is to release \u00a35.7bn of capital, enough to support an extra \u00a3150bn of lending, said the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney. For comparison, he said total net lending in the UK last year was \u00a360bn. Those statistics are reassuring. If you are running a business wishing to capitalise on the 10% fall in the value of sterling against the dollar \u2013 an exporter, say \u2013 you should be able to secure bank finance if you have a viable investment plan. What\u2019s more, supplies of credit should remain comfortable for the foreseeable future. Banks\u2019 balance sheets have been tested against scenarios \u201cfar more severe than the country currently faces\u201d. Lenders\u2019 funding costs have not risen after the referendum. And the Bank\u2019s policeman will prowl the neighbourhood to ensure lenders don\u2019t slip the freshly released cash out of the back door in the form of unearned dividends for shareholders or bonuses for well-fed executives. Jolly good, it sounds like a plan. Or, rather, half a plan. Will households and businesses actually want to borrow more in the current climate? Avoiding a 2009-style credit crunch is almost the easy part. The harder part is to stimulate confidence when sterling may not have reached its post-Brexit floor \u2013 it hit $1.30 on Tuesday \u2013 and clarity on the terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU could be two years away. The Bank has little scope to reduce interest rates. A cut from 0.5% is virtually certain but Carney shows little appetite to experiment with negative rates, which could play havoc with banks\u2019 and building societies\u2019 funding models. More quantitative easing is a possibility but might simply be lost in the wash since 10-year gilts are already yielding less than 1%. Carney, at least, was honest about the predicament: \u201cThe future potential of this economy and its implications for jobs, real wages and wealth are not the gifts of the Bank of England, but will be driven by major decisions made by others in the public and private sectors.\u201d You bet. If the Bank\u2019s confidence is well founded, the UK financial system seems perfectly able to withstand the jolt of Brexit. But the timing of a return to meaningful growth is anybody\u2019s guess. Banks\u2019 share prices have fallen but are certainly not signalling distress. The message, also described by those ultra-low gilt yields, is clear: stability is not the biggest problem; economic growth will be. Brexit to blame for commercial property lock-in \u201cThere\u2019s no point panicking because we\u2019ve locked the doors so you can\u2019t get out.\u201d This less-than-comforting message is spreading across the commercial property fund sector. M&amp;G has halted redemptions on its \u00a34.4bn open-ended fund. So has Aviva, on a similar \u00a31.8bn vehicle, following Standard Life\u2019s suspension of trading on Monday on a \u00a32.9bn fund. Add them up and that\u2019s a serious slug of investors\u2019 capital for which no prices are available. Brexit is the proximate cause, of course. It is blindingly obvious that a weaker pound and an exit from the EU probably aren\u2019t helpful for UK commercial property prices. The market looked pumped up even before the vote, at least in London and the south-east. The realisation has dawned on a lot of people at once, thus the scramble to get out. But the deeper explanation is that these open-ended commercial property funds are a daft financial product. Or, more strictly, they are a silly product to buy if you don\u2019t understand that the manager\u2019s right to suspend redemptions is more than a theoretical risk. Commercial property can\u2019t be turned into cash overnight. Once a fund\u2019s cash-in-hand has been exhausted, the only sensible approach is to call a time-out on dealings to allow an orderly sale of selected properties. It is the only way to ensure equal treatment for the mob banging at the door and those investors remaining in their seats. If some retail investors didn\u2019t understand the principle, they weren\u2019t paying attention. The same plot played in 2008-09. For policy-makers, there is a worry of contagion. Will investors, unable to get out of their property punts, be obliged to liquidate investments elsewhere? Some will if they need cash in a hurry, but let\u2019s not get carried away. An illiquid asset \u2013 property \u2013 has been shown to be exactly that. The stress only becomes truly serious if clearing prices settle at 30% to 40% below old levels, inflicting heavy pain on investors and lenders alike. We\u2019re not there yet.",

      "bodyText": "Commercial property funds have emerged as a weak link in the financial sector in the wake of the Brexit vote. Two funds have been suspended in successive days and more are expected to follow. Here are some questions about how they operate and the potential knock-on effects for the wider economy. What are commercial property funds? They are funds that allow people to invest in commercial property developments, such as office blocks and shopping centres, that normally rely on money from major professional investors. How much money is invested in them? Around \u00a335bn, or 7%, of the total investment in UK commercial property is invested in these funds. Why are the Standard Life and Aviva funds being closed? In the run-up to the EU referendum, investors started pulling money from these funds, presumably because they thought Brexit could reduce commercial property prices. Data from the Investment Association shows retail investors \u2013 or non-professional investors \u2013 had withdrawn \u00a3360m from property funds in May, the month before the referendum. Large-scale outflows cause problems for these funds because they are based on assets \u2013 in this case, commercial property \u2013 that are difficult to sell quickly when investors want their money back. So the restrictions are being put in place to give fund managers time to sell their properties. Otherwise, they would be forced to sell assets at fire-sale prices to fund the redemption requests. That would drive down the value of the fund, encouraging more investors to cash out, creating a vicious circle. \u201cBy limiting redemptions, funds would allow the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s political and economic environment to recede. In turn, this could stem fire sales, limiting the discounts at which funds would have to sell their holdings,\u201d said Eduardo Gorab, a property economist at Capital Economics. Are more funds expected to close? Standard Life was first, then Aviva Investors announced restrictions. It is possible others will follow. Andrew Bailey, the new chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said this should be seen not as a sign of panic but that the market is working properly. Suspension of funds was \u201cdesigned into the structures to deal precisely with that situation where there\u2019s been some shock to the market\u201d. Could this affect the residential property market? It is not immediately clear how this this feeds through into residential properties, although a hit to sentiment in the commercial property industry can quickly feed through to homebuyers, who might decide to pull out of transactions. The Bank of England is concerned that if all the property funds seize up at once it could hasten any fall in commercial property prices. In its half-yearly assessment of risks to financial markets, the Bank said: \u201cAny adjustment in commercial real estate markets could be amplified by the behaviour of leveraged investors and investors in open-ended commercial property funds\u201d. Commercial property prices were flat in the first half of the year, the Bank said, although they were up 40% since the depths of the financial crisis. Could this affect the broader UK economy? Around 75% of small businesses use commercial property as collateral for loans, so they could face problems with their banks if prices fall too sharply. Banks also use commercial property to count towards their capital buffers; at the end of 2015 around 55% of their core capital \u2013 their main safety net in a crisis \u2013 was based on commercial property. The big banks were less exposed to commercial property than the smaller players, the Bank of England said. The commercial property funds also invest a pool of cash \u2013 which is used as a float to pay investors when they withdraw their money \u2013 in the shares of listed property developers, such as British Land. This could also exacerbate share price falls in these companies. What is the Bank of England doing? The Bank has already conducted stress tests on banks to ensure they can withstand a 30% fall in commercial property prices and it intends to include another shock in prices in this year\u2019s stress tests. It is also monitoring the market to ensure there are no shocks from this sector. Specifically, it is looking for any impact that it could have on businesses with loans secured on commercial property (such as a high street shop). Bailey said the City regulator is preparing to review the way commercial property funds are structured. Events of the last few days have highlighted the problem of promising investors instant payback when the means of funding that redemption \u2013 commercial property \u2013 is not easy to sell quickly.",

      "bodyText": "Sterling tumbled to a 31-year low against the dollar and oil dropped below $50 a barrel as concerns deepened over the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. Fears that a collapse in demand for new construction projects also spooked investors, depressing shares in housebuilders and property companies. Although the FTSE 100 was 0.4% higher, at 6547, the domestic-focused FTSE 250 mid-cap index tumbled more than 400 points, or 2.7%, to 15,680. Adding to the gloom was a closely watched survey of the services sector, which showed a worse-than-expected reading of 52.3 in June, down from 53.5 in May. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Sterling extended its decline after the survey, falling more than 1% to hit a 31-year low of $1.3112 at one stage. This is below the level of $1.3118 reached on Monday 27 June in the wake of the referendum result. The Markit Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the services industry covers almost 80% of the UK economy. The growth figure of 52.3 was the lowest for three years, as new business weakened and firms used their spare capacity to tackle backlogs. Markit said the results reflect the \u201cintensified\u201d anxiety over Brexit in the runup to the referendum. Almost 90% of the data was collected before the vote. Chris Williamson, chief economist at the data compiler Markit, said a recent run of surveys covering manufacturing, construction and services showed that the pace of UK economic growth slowed to just 0.2% in the second quarter, losing further momentum in June as anxiety over Brexit intensified. \u201cA further slowing, and possible contraction, looks highly likely in coming months as a result of the uncertainty created by the EU referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, with the June PMIs having already fallen into territory that would normally be associated with the Bank of England cutting interest rates, it\u2019s unlikely that policymakers will feel the need to wait for more data before unleashing additional monetary stimulus. More policy action is therefore likely following the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee\u2019s next assessment of the economy on 14 July,\u201d he said. Property and building shares began falling on Monday after Standard Life closed its \u00a32.9bn commercial property fund to redemptions as investors panicked about the uncertainty created by the EU referendum result. Housebuilders Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley and Barratt were all among the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, losing more than 4% along with Land Securities, Britain\u2019s largest commercial property developer. Tuesday\u2019s falls followed plunges in housebuilders\u2019 shares immediately after the referendum vote, which wiped more than a third off some companies\u2019 values in two days. Persimmon, Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder, published a trading statement that said its business was largely unaffected by the Brexit vote, although the group said it was too early to make a definitive call. Its shares fell 4.3%. Fund managers were also affected, with Standard Life down 4.6% and Schroders falling 5.7%. The biggest loser was Legal &amp; General, whose shares dropped 6.1%. \u2022This article was amended on 5 July to exchange erroneous \u00a3 signs with the correct $ signs. The 31-year low of sterling is, of course, $1.3112.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned of \u201cchallenging\u201d risks to financial stability following the vote for Brexit as it took steps to release up to \u00a3150bn worth of lending to households and businesses by relaxing regulatory requirements on the banking sector. As it published its twice-yearly assessment of financial stability on Tuesday, the Bank said the risks it had feared ahead of the EU referendum had started to crystallise. The shares of banks have fallen by 20% since the poll while sterling was plunging to fresh 31-year lows and on the brink of falling though $1.30 as London markets were closing on Tuesday. The pound had spiked to $1.50 as voting closed on 23 June in expectation of a remain victory. In its financial stability report, the Bank said: \u201cThe current outlook for UK financial stability is challenging.\u201d As a result, the Bank is monitoring a number of sectors closely, including growth in buy-to-let mortgage lending and a potential downturn in the commercial property sector, where a number of major funds have barred investors from withdrawing their investments. The current account deficit \u2013 which measures the shortfall between money paid out by the UK and money coming in \u2013 and household debt burdens are also on its watchlist. \u201cThe number of vulnerable households could increase due to a tougher economic outlook and a potential tightening of credit conditions. In particular there is growing evidence that uncertainty about the referendum has delayed major economic decisions, such as business investment, construction and housing market activity,\u201d said Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, in his third public intervention since the referendum result. He first spoke on the morning the referendum result was announced, reassuring investors that the Bank would do what was necessary to keep markets stable. Last week he signalled that a cut to interest rates, already at a historic 0.5% low, might be imminent. The latest decision on interest rates will be taken by the Bank next week. \u201cThe UK has entered a period of uncertainty and significant economic adjustment,\u201d Carney said, as he stated it was the Bank\u2019s role \u201cto be straight with the British people\u201d about risks to financial stability. As the Bank issued its assessment of risks to the financial system, Carney said households should act prudently in the wake of the referendum. \u201cWe\u2019re advising people to be prudent. We always advise people to be prudent, whether times are good or times are difficult,\u201d said Carney. \u201cCertainly if you\u2019re taking out a mortgage, at some point over the life of that mortgage times will be difficult, it might be at the start, it might be five years in, it might be 10, 15, whatever. So you want to make sure as a family, as an individual, that you\u2019ll be able to service that mortgage if times are tough; you don\u2019t want to lose your flat, your home,\u201d he said. Making attempts to ensure that there was a not a rerun of conditions after the 2008 banking crisis when banks were reluctant to issue loans, Carney said: \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing we want to take off the table.\u201d \u201cGiven the core resilience of the banks, it\u2019s important to ensure that there is no question about the availability of credit,\u201d he added, saying banks had \u00a3130bn more capital since the crisis and could now be part of the solution, not the problem. \u201cIf we do see a slowing in credit growth, it will be demand driven not supply driven.\u201d Threadneedle Street released banks from a requirement to hold \u00a35.7bn of capital as a protection against downturns. It is the first time the Bank has enacted this policy, which will increase banks\u2019 capacity for lending to households and businesses by up to \u00a3150bn. The governor was speaking as George Osborne met with the heads of major banks; in a joint statement with the chancellor the banks agreed to keep lending. \u201cWhile we are realistic about the economic challenge facing the country after the referendum result; we are reassured that collectively we can rise to it. The last time Britain faced an economic shock the banks were at the heart of the problem. Thanks to the hard work of rebuilding the banks, making them stronger and safer, and the arrival of new challenger banks \u2013 banks and building societies are now part of the solution,\u201d the banks and the chancellor said. As well as relaxing the amount of capital that banks must hold, Threadneedle Street is also making life easier for insurance companies to cope with market turmoil and is committed to offering cheap loans to the banking sector to head off the threat of a credit crisis. But, Carney said, the Bank could not act alone in shoring up markets and the economy. \u201cThe future potential of this economy and its implications for jobs, real wages and wealth are not the gifts of the Bank of England but will be driven by major decisions made by others in the public and private sectors.\u201d Frances O\u2019 Grady, general secretary of the TUC, the trade union umbrella body, called on the government to speed up infrastructure projects and kickstart the third runway at Heathrow. \u201cProtecting the economy from Brexit risks can\u2019t be left to the Bank of England alone. The government must now act quickly so that working people do not pay the price of leaving the EU,\u201d O\u2019Grady said. The Money Advice Trust, a debt charity, said it was expecting an increase in demand for the services of its National Debtline service. \u201cIt is now more important than ever that we are prepared for what could be a significant increase in the number of people falling into problem debt in the UK,\u201d said Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust. The Bank is also concerned about the ability to keep financing the UK\u2019s current account deficit \u2013 \u201chigh by historical and international standards\u201d \u2013 at a time when investment inflows into the UK are slowing. It said that \u201cduring a prolonged period of heightened uncertainty there is a risk that overseas investors could continue to be deterred from investing in the United Kingdom\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder Persimmon said it was trading well and sticking to plans to return cash to shareholders despite fears about the property sector following the vote to leave the EU. The York-based company said a few potential customers cancelled viewings straight after the referendum result was announced on 24 June but that business was back to normal. In a trading update, Persimmon said it was too soon to judge the effect of the referendum vote on the market but that demand for houses and low interest rates would probably keep business buoyant. In the first six months of 2016 Persimmon sold 7,238 new homes \u2013 up 6% on a year earlier \u2013 at an average price of \u00a3205,500, also up 6%. Revenues increased 12% to \u00a31.49bn. Jeff Fairburn, Persimmon\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe first half trading has been good. We\u2019ve been pushing hard through that period to the end of June to get increasing volumes and the increase in the selling price. Forward sales are good and we have got some good new sites to start.\u201d Since Britain voted to leave the EU, Persimmon\u2019s shares have lost a third of their value along with other housebuilders and property-related companies. Investors fear a post-Brexit economic slowdown will damage consumer confidence and push up unemployment, causing people to scrap house purchases. The company said it would continue to pay out extra dividends as planned, returning almost \u00a32.8bn, or \u00a39 a share, to investors by 2021. But Persimmon\u2019s shares fell 5% to \u00a313.62, among the worst performers in the FTSE 100 index. Fairburn said: \u201cIt\u2019s [the share price] disappointing but nevertheless we are just focused on trading. We will deal with what we see on the ground. So far so good. It\u2019s little more than a week since the vote and we have seen good levels of interest on site and we had a good trading week last week. \u201cPeople are obviously asking the question about what happens now but it\u2019s too early to say. We saw a few more cancellations but that was an immediate reaction and it\u2019s settled down to more normal levels.\u201d Concerns intensified on Monday when a survey showed a sharp slowdown in construction activity in the runup to the referendum and Standard Life stopped withdrawals from a \u00a32.9bn property fund as investors rushed for the exit. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t guess from Persimmon\u2019s results that the company has lost around a third of its value in the last fortnight. That\u2019s because the stock market is looking forward to the next six months and beyond, and the Brexit vote is casting a long shadow over the UK housebuilding sector.\u201d Uncertainty over the referendum prompted the biggest fall in the number of people trying to buy a property since the financial crisis, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) and the chancellor predicted house prices could fall by up to 18% if Britain voted to leave. On the Rics survey, Fairburn said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that. We are selling to first-time buyers in the domestic marketplace. Affordability levels are good and we don\u2019t sell to investors and we\u2019re not in London. \u201cThere is no reason we can see why people shouldn\u2019t be confident at the moment given the position that they see. A call on house prices is down to an individual view and we are not seeing any indication of that.\u201d Forterra, a brickmaker, said on Tuesday it would mothball two factories in Lancashire because it had enough supplies to meet demand. \u201cGiven current economic uncertainty and sufficient brick inventory levels, the board has reviewed the current production plan and has decided to maximise the utilisation of our most efficient brick plants and effectively manage our cost base,\u201d the company said.",
