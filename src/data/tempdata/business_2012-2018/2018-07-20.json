      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, has been revealed as a key funder of the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs \u2013 a consistent promoter of climate science scepticism. Rinehart\u2019s company, Hancock Prospecting, donated $2.3m to the IPA in 2016 and $2.2m in 2017, according to disclosures made to the New South Wales supreme court. As part of a long-running legal dispute over the use of company funds, Rinehart\u2019s daughter Bianca had served a subpoena to access documents that would have shed light on the two donations from Hancock Prospecting to the IPA. The IPA has close ties to the Liberal party and IPA fellows regularly appear in the media. The payments suggest that more than a third of the IPA\u2019s income in 2016 and 2017 was from Hancock Prospecting, the majority of which is owned privately by Rinehart. According to Forbes, Rinehart was the seventh-richest woman in the world in 2017 and Australia\u2019s richest person, with current wealth estimated to be $17.6bn. The IPA is a registered charity but is not legally required to disclose its funders and has declined to reveal them in recent years, citing concerns that donors could be \u201cintimidated\u201d. According to the court judgment, Bianca Rinehart\u2019s solicitors had been provided with a schedule of \u201cdonations and sponsorships\u201d from Hancock Prospecting where it was disclosed, the judgment said, that the company \u201cpaid or provided amounts to IPA in a total of $2.3m for the 2016 financial year and $2.2m in the 2017 financial year\u201d. The donations also raise questions about the way the IPA has disclosed the nature of its revenues. The IPA\u2019s 2017 annual report declared $6.1m of income but said that 86% had come from individuals. Based on that report, Hancock Prospecting\u2019s $2.2m donation would appear to have constituted more than a third of the IPA\u2019s income that year. In 2016, the IPA reported that 91% of donations were from individuals, but that year Hancock Prospecting\u2019s $2.3m donation constituted almost half the IPA\u2019s income of $4.96m. Hancock Prospecting was asked why it was supporting the IPA, if the donations were linked to specific work, and if it was still a supporter. IPA spokesman Evan Mulholland replied, \u201cno comment\u201d when asked about the donations and if supporters should be concerned that so much if its income is derived from one person. The IPA has a long history of publishing books and sponsoring speaking tours of prominent climate science deniers. Rinehart\u2019s own views on human-caused climate change match those promoted by the IPA. In 2011, she wrote in a magazine column that she had \u201cyet to hear scientific evidence to satisfy me that if the very, very small amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (approximately 0.38%) was increased, it could lead to significant global warming\u201d. She added: \u201cI have never met a geologist or leading scientist who believes adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will have any significant effect on climate change, especially not from a relatively small country like Australia.\u201d Rinehart has also supported Australian speaking tours of British climate change denier Lord Christopher Monckton. Prof Ian Plimer, another prominent geologist who rejects climate change science, sits on the board of Hancock Prospecting subsidiary Roy Hill Holdings. In 2013, the IPA gave Rinehart a \u201cfree enterprise leader award\u201d \u2013 which she accepted at a dinner alongside Tony Abbott just before he became prime minister and Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch\u2019s father, Sir Keith Murdoch, helped found the institute and the News Corp boss served on its council from 1986 to 2000. In 2016 Rinehart was made an \u201chonorary life member\u201d of the IPA. The IPA has also promoted massive export-focused coalmines planned for the Galilee basin, arguing they would help lift Indians out of poverty. Rinehart has a direct stake in GVK Hancock, one company looking to develop coalmines in the Queensland deposit. The IPA is seen among progressives as having an outgrown influence on the Liberal party. Liberal MP Tim Wilson and Senator James Paterson are both former IPA staff members. In May it was reported the IPA had been proposed as a potential co-host of a later-cancelled visit to Australia by former US EPA chief Scott Pruitt. An IPA-sponsored climate study that claimed most global warming was natural was heavily promoted among conservative media outlets around the world. Climate scientists who reviewed the paper, which had appeared in a journal, described the work as \u201cjunk science\u201d. HPPL was approached for this article but no response had been received at the time of publication.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump escalated economic global tensions on Friday, lashing out a range of targets that included the European Union, the Federal Reserve and China, indicating that he is prepared to raise tariffs on Chinese imports from $34bn to cover the entire $505bn of Chinese imports. \u201cI\u2019m willing to go to 500,\u201d he said during a taped interview with the business channel CNBC, an escalation he was prepared to make because it \u201cwas the right thing to do for our country\u201d and because the rise in stocks \u2013 the S&amp;P 500 is up 31% since his election \u2013 allowed him to pursue a more aggressive trade policy. Trump also turned to Twitter to predict that US soybean farmers will emerge victorious from the US-China trade dispute. \u201cFarmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!\u201d Trump\u2019s comments caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to register a slight dip before the opening stock market bell in New York, though it then shook off the president\u2019s threat and rose again on strong US corporate earnings growth. The US president did not limit himself to commenting on tariffs and trade, and he accused China and the EU of currency manipulation. \u201cChina, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the US is raising rates while the dollar gets stronger and stronger with each passing day \u2013 taking away our big competitive edge.\u201d He added: \u201cAs usual, not a level playing field \u2026\u201d While the Trump administration has stopped short of honoring a campaign pledge to formally designate China as a currency manipulator, the president\u2019s stream of consciousness approach to economic issues, andwhat many experts perceive as the dangers of unintended consequences, is causing alarm in foreign capitals and central banks. The president\u2019s latest finance-focused comments come ahead of the visit of the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, to Washington next week for talks aimed at heading off a US-European trade war. Juncker is set to meet Trump on Wednesday. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor who used her annual summer press conference to warn of a proposed 25% US tariff on European cars and components on national security grounds, said Juncker \u201cwill be making suggestions there about how we can enter into a discussion process to avoid this\u201d. Trump has threatened to slap a 25% tariff on imported cars and components, with a commerce department review under way to establish whether this is justified on national security grounds. Merkel noted that German carmakers produce 400,000 cars a year in the US which are exported. BMW\u2019s largest factory was, she pointed out, not in Germany but in Spartanburg, South Carolina. But, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not filling myself with expectations or predictions\u201d for Juncker\u2019s trip. In a further breach of established protocol, Trump redoubled his recent criticism of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to steadily raise interest rates this year. In an apparent reference to Fed rate increases, Trump tweeted: \u201cTightening now hurts all that we have done. Debt coming due &amp; we are raising rates -- Really?\u201d Trump\u2019s comments are a break with the tradition that presidents avoid commenting on the path of domestic monetary policy. Interest rates are seen as the domain of the central bank, while the currency is regarded as the responsibility of US treasury officials. In June, he also broke established protocol as regards to sensitive economic data with a tweet signaling May\u2019s strong jobs report ahead of the labor department\u2019s own announcement, a move some describe as a blatant misuse of presidential power as such numbers usually have an impact on stock and bond prices. The president\u2019s latest interest rate and dollar-focused comments came a day after he first criticized the Fed\u2019s series of rate increases. The Fed has raised interest rates five times since Trump took office, with two of those coming this year under the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, Trump\u2019s pick to replace Janet Yellen. Trump told CNBC he\u2019s worried the Fed\u2019s policies will cancel out his efforts to boost the economy. \u201cI am not happy about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t like all of this work that we\u2019re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up,\u201d Trump said.",

      "bodyText": "The war of words over Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose wide-ranging tariffs on imports from China and the European Union has intensified after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the levies threatened the incomes of workers across the world. On Friday, Merkel described possible US tariffs on imported cars as a breach of World Trade Organization rules and \u201ca real threat to the prosperity of many in the world\u201d as Trump went on US television to say that he was ready to expand his roster of tariffs on Beijing to $500bn, covering almost every product imported to the US from China. Earlier, Trump said on Twitter that the US \u201cshould be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals\u201d. Stock markets slipped back on the news, with the German Dax the worst hit. The Frankfurt-based index tumbled 144 points, or 1.1% to 12,542. The FTSE 100 dropped almost 60 points in response to the tit-for-tat battle before ending the day down just 5 points at 7,678. The dollar index, a measure of its value against a basket of other major currencies, was down 0.6% after it reached a one year high on Thursday. For several months the Trump administration has ramped up its campaign to force rival economies to end what it believes are artificial subsidies and restrictive practices that deny US firms access to their markets. Trump has also been angered by central bank policies he says keep rival currencies low compared with the dollar, making US exports expensive. In his attempts to promote a more favourable exchange rate, Trump rounded on the US central bank, the Federal Resrve, for pressing ahead with interest rate hikes, thereby making the US a more popular destination for global savings and pushing up the value of the dollar. Merkel accepted during her annual summer news conference in Berlin that Trump\u2019s regular jibes at Germany \u201ccertainly have something to do with our economic size\u201d. \u201cI try to address the criticism but also to provide an independent, confident answer, and this doesn\u2019t always match the view held by the American president,\u201d she said. She added that Trump\u2019s complaint that Berlin is exploiting the US when it comes to trade was misplaced. Merkel said that narrative only takes into account the trade in goods and that the trade in services and repatriation of profits to the US from Europe favoured the US to an even greater extent. The German chancellor also pointed out that BMW\u2019s largest car factory was not in Germany but in Spartanburg, South Carolina and employs 8,800 workers. Last week, Washington listed $200bn (\u00a3150bn) worth of additional Chinese products it intends to place tariffs on as soon as September. The list named more than 6,000 items, including food products, minerals and consumer goods such as handbags, which would become subject to a 10% tariff. Trump has threatened to add another $300bn of products to the list, but his intervention on Friday was his most explicit threat so far. The European commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, has already warned the White House it would be prepared to use tariffs against as much as $300bnof US products should Trump slap higher taxes on European automotive imports to the US. The president threatened last month to impose tariffs of 20% on imports of cars from the EU after Brussels carried through plans to tax US consumer goods \u2013 such as whiskey, cigars and Harley-Davidson motorcycles \u2013 in retaliation against US tariffs on European steel and aluminium. Oliver Jones at Capital Economics said investors would flee stock markets in Asia and Europe if Trump pressed ahead with his tariff threats. \u201cThe retaliation by other countries to US protectionism so far has mostly been aimed at US farmers, not US multinationals. But that could change. In particular, we suspect that China will start to target US multinationals operating in China directly rather than imposing more tariffs of its own.\u201d Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: \u201cHaving come away from the Nato summit with an apparent win using his strong-arm negotiating tactics, this move appears designed to bring the Chinese to the table.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe were a town that, like others, was dying with empty shops,\u201d says Gerry Clarkson, the no-nonsense leader of Ashford borough council, of why it bought a run down shopping centre. A third of the stores in the Kent town\u2019s 1980s-built Park Mall lay empty and even the charity shops that had moved in were struggling to scratch a living. Things were so grim the town received a handout in 2012 after being picked as a Portas pilot, named after TV retail guru Mary Portas whose high street review was prompted by the wave of store closures that followed the post-credit crunch recession. Clarkson took charge of the Conservative-controlled council in 2013, and inherited a town that was \u201cliving in the past\u201d. \u201cNothing was happening here,\u201d he says. These days, it\u2019s a different story. \u201cWe mean business,\u201d says Clarkson, banging his fists on the table as he describes a commercial culture that has seen the council move aggressively into buying property in order to regenerate its city centre. \u201cI said we had to stop crying in our beer and plan how to become independent.\u201d After three years in council hands, Park Mall is virtually full and just about washes its face financially. The 32-shop arcade \u2013 with an eclectic brand mix \u2013 is on the up thanks to a programme of family friendly activities designed to pull in shoppers. Footfall is up 0.8% in the year to date, bucking a wider picture of steep declines in shopping visits across the UK, where the fall is more than 3%. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about shopping,\u201d says Clarkson, referring to council investments that include the \u00a375m Elwick Place development, which will bring a Travelodge and six-screen Picturehouse cinema to the town, later this year. \u201cYou have got to create a civic heartbeat so that everybody is proud to live here.\u201d The council offered independent retailers flexible terms to fill the empty shops in Park Mall, an approach that helped Made in Ashford, which sells the wares of local artisans, establish itself. Opposite the shop is Emporia Fabric &amp; Craft, a trendy store that sells fabrics and runs sewing workshops. A new bridal store has also recently moved in. \u201cThere used to be nothing here. A few charity shops, a lot of the shops were empty. It was really bleak,\u201d says Melissa Dawkins, who runs Made in Ashford. Business is strong, with June sales up 13% up on 2017. Councils around Britain are grappling with the fallout from changing shopping patterns that could leave 100,000 shops lying empty within a decade, according to the recent Grimsey 2 report. Bill Grimsey, the former Wickes and Iceland chief executive who was revisiting his influential 2013 review, warned: \u201cWe have to accept that there is already too much retail space in the UK and that bricks and mortar retailing can no longer be the anchor for thriving high streets and town centres.\u201d Ashford is seeing an influx of investment, including a new craft beer brewery from the owners of the Chapel Down winery, and it has not gone unnoticed by the government. It has seen more than 35,000 high street jobs disappear this year after a string of retailers and restaurant groups, including Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look, Prezzo and Jamie\u2019s Italian, announced plans to close hundreds of outlets. On Thursday, it was confirmed that Poundworld, which had 5,000 staff, is to disappear altogether. To that end, the high street minister,Jake Berry, has drafted in Graham Galpin, a senior Ashford councillor who has been a key figure in its regeneration, to a new expert panel that will review the root causes of high street decline and try to come up with some answers. In Ashford, the council is already looking to relax planning policy to allow a broader range of property use within the town centre and Galpin, who read the Grimsey report with interest, suggests councils need to overcome their \u201cfear of the future\u201d. \u201cWhat town centres are today is not what they were five or 10 years ago,\u201d says Galpin. \u201cSome long term residents are appalled by what we are doing ... they want to go back to having [Woolworths] on the high street.\u201d Officials in towns in the north east and north west of England, who have the highest percentage of long-term empty shops, could argue Ashford has some natural advantages, not least the high speed rail line that whisks locals into central London in just over half an hour, fuelling a house price boom. Paris is under two hours away. \u201cThe train line is the critical thing we have that others don\u2019t but if you go 20 miles south you hit Folkestone, which has the seafront and the beauty of that,\u201d says Andrew Osborne, Ashford\u2019s economic development manager. \u201cIt\u2019s about utilising your natural assets. We\u2019re dealing with the same issues as every other town in Kent.\u201d Park Mall has focused on fostering independent retailers because it has the much larger County Square mall, home to major chains such Debenhams and Marks &amp; Spencer, as competition on its doorstep. But from Debenhams\u2019 first floor cafe you can also see the meringue-like canopy of the Richard Rogers-designed McArthurGlen Designer Outlet where diggers are scraping out the foundations of a \u00a390m extension that will add 50 stores and create a destination to rival the pull of the successful Bicester Village designer discount mall in Oxfordshire. While Ashford bought Park Mall for a six-figure sum, other councils have gone on to do much bigger retail deals, which some analysts consider a worrying trend. Canterbury\u2019s council took control of the Whitefriars shopping centre for \u00a375m while Shropshire county council has spent just over \u00a350m on three shopping centres in Shrewsbury. Given Ashford\u2019s focus on revitalising the town centre, the council\u2019s decision to permit the 100,000 sq ft expansion of the McArthurGlen centre seems counterintuitive even if there are strict controls over the brands that can move in. But given shoppers head to the outlet to stock up on cut price Calvin Kleins, Barbour jackets and Diesel jeans, the council argues it will help the economy and not destroy its good work. \u201cOne needs to be careful in balancing the development of in-town versus out-of-town,\u201d says Galpin. \u201cWhen we took over Park Mall we got it for a very low sum. I wouldn\u2019t countenance [a bigger deal] unless you have got a fall back position. We\u2019re not in the business of social engineering, we are in the business of making sure our people are well serviced. In all that we have done we have not made a mistake yet. If you have got people back on the high street they are spending money.\u201d",

It has seen more than 35,000 high street jobs disappear this year after a string of retailers and restaurant groups, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/17/mothercare-to-close-50-outlets-and-reinstate-ousted-ceo\">Mothercare</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/30/carpetright-losses-restructure\">Carpetright</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/carpetright-moss-bros-kingfisher-high-street-retail-mothercare\">New Look</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/28/prezzo-restaurant-chain-to-close-a-third-of-its-uk-branches\">Prezzo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/06/jamie-oliver-close-restaurants-brexit-jamies-italian-barbecoa\">Jamie\u2019s Italian</a>, announced plans to close hundreds of outlets.

Paris is under two hours away. </p> <p>\u201cThe train line is the critical thing we have that others don\u2019t but if you go 20 miles south you hit Folkestone, which has the seafront and the beauty of that,\u201d says Andrew Osborne, Ashford\u2019s economic development manager. \u201cIt\u2019s about utilising your natural assets. We\u2019re dealing with the same issues as every other town in Kent.\u201d</p> <p>Park Mall has focused on fostering independent retailers because it has the much larger County Square mall, home to major chains such Debenhams and Marks &amp; Spencer, as competition on its doorstep. But from Debenhams\u2019 first floor cafe you can also see the meringue-like canopy of the Richard Rogers-designed McArthurGlen Designer Outlet where diggers are scraping out the foundations of a \u00a390m extension that will add 50 stores and create a destination to rival the pull of the successful <a href=\"http://www.bicestervillage.com/\">Bicester Village</a> designer discount mall in Oxfordshire.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f87a640d29d1381302b2c6acb2c11adbf7022756\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f87a640d29d1381302b2c6acb2c11adbf7022756/0_280_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Made in Ashford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two women shop in Made in Ashford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Ashford bought Park Mall for a six-figure sum, other councils have gone on to do much bigger retail deals, which some analysts consider a worrying trend. Canterbury\u2019s council took control of the Whitefriars shopping centre for \u00a375m while Shropshire county council has spent just over \u00a350m on three shopping centres in Shrewsbury.</p> <p>Given Ashford\u2019s focus on revitalising the town centre, the council\u2019s decision to permit the 100,000 sq ft expansion of the McArthurGlen centre seems counterintuitive even if there are strict controls over the brands that can move in. But given shoppers head to the outlet to stock up on cut price Calvin Kleins, Barbour jackets and Diesel jeans, the council argues it will help the economy and not destroy its good work.</p> <p>\u201cOne needs to be careful in balancing the development of in-town versus out-of-town,\u201d says Galpin. \u201cWhen we took over Park Mall we got it for a very low sum. I wouldn\u2019t countenance [a bigger deal] unless you have got a fall back position. We\u2019re not in the business of social engineering, we are in the business of making sure our people are well serviced. In all that we have done we have not made a mistake yet. If you have got people back on the high street they are spending money.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "Trump threatens to put tariffs on all $500bn Chinese imports \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "President Trump\u2019s controversial comments that the Federal Reserve is wrong to raise US interest rates and his new threats to impose tariffs on $500bn worth of Chinese imports have unsettled investors as the trading week winds to a close. The dollar was damaged by the remarks, giving some support to Wall Street. But European markets likely to be hit by any escalation of trade tensions, Germany in particular, came under pressure. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.07% or 5.18 points at 7678.79 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.98% to 12,561.42 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.35% lower at 5398.32 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.41% to 21,794.60 Spain\u2019s Ibex edged up 0.04% to 9724.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 29 points or 0.12%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Stock markets are likely to remain under pressure even if this latest trade dispute blows over, says Oliver Jones at Capital Economics: We suspect that equities across Emerging Asia would slump once more if President Trump followed through with his latest tariff threat. Stock markets in Europe would probably be hit even harder than they have been so far too. Meanwhile, although the S&amp;P 500 has proved fairly resilient to trade worries so far, and has actually risen since they resurfaced in June, we doubt that this will last. The retaliation by other countries to US protectionism so far has mostly been aimed at US farmers, not US multinationals. But that could change. In particular, we suspect that China will start to target US multinationals operating in China directly rather than imposing more tariffs of its own. What\u2019s more, even if this latest escalation in the trade war is somehow averted, we think that there are other reasons to be pessimistic about the outlook for equities in both the US and the rest of the world. Regardless of the direction of US trade policy, we think that China\u2019s economy will lose more momentum over the rest of this year, and forecast that the US economy will slow sharply in 2019 as the cumulative effects of Fed tightening and the fading fiscal boost start to bite. With this in mind, we forecast that the S&amp;P 500 will fall to 2,300 by the end of next year, compared to just over 2,800 now, and think that equities in the rest of the world will fall sharply too. Stock markets are off their worst levels, although European indices are struggling compared with the UK and Wall Street. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: After a few days without trade war headlines the topic has come back to life, as Trump turns the trade war rhetoric all the way up to 11 with his announcement that $500 billion of Chinese goods could suffer penalties. Having come away from the NATO summit with an apparent win using his strong-arm negotiating tactics, this move appears designed to bring the Chinese to the table. Markets have recovered from their initial shock, perhaps indicating that this kind of newflash is starting to lose its power. The news spoiled the FTSE 100\u2019s attempt to move above the 7700 zone, which has held back progress for over a month now, while once again the Dax is taking the news on the chin, shedding 150 points as the week winds down and wiping out most of the progress made over the past few days. Another trend undergoing a reversal is that of the US dollar, which has fallen back today after weeks of gains. The dollar index has seen some outflows, with the safe-haven yen a beneficiary as investors cut back on risk thanks to the trade war rhetoric. However, the ongoing rally is not finished yet it seems, Jerome Powell\u2019s comments this week having made it clear that the Fed has no intention of deviating from current policy, regardless of the views of the White House. The dollar remains in the doldrums as the US currency continues to react to Donald Trump\u2019s complaints about its current strength, along with investor concerns about the escalating trade war tensions with China. The dollar index, a measure of its value against a basket of other major currencies, is down 0.6% after it reached a one year high on Thursday. The weakness of the dollar has benefited the pound, which is up 0.73% to $1.3107 against the US currency, despite the continuing uncertainties over Brexit. One of the US central bank\u2019s members has responded to Donald Trump\u2019s comments. Reuters reports: The Federal Reserve will remain unaffected by President Donald Trump\u2019s comments on U.S. monetary policy and is focused on achieving the goals set for it by Congress, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday. \u201cThe (Fed\u2019s policy-setting) committee has a mandate to keep inflation low and stable and obtain maximum employment for the U.S. economy, so people can comment, including the president and other politicians, but it\u2019s up to the committee to try to take the best action we can to achieve those objectives,\u201d Bullard told reporters following an event in Glasgow, Kentucky. US markets have made a nervous start but the falls are not as bad as had been feared earlier. Investors are of course concerned about the latest threats from Donald Trump about imposing tariffs on $500bn worth of Chinese imports to the US, but there is some support for markets from Microsoft\u2019s forecast beating results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 26 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened just 0.06% lower. The Nasdaq Composite managed to edge up slightly, up 0.19% at the start of trading. Still with trade, and German chancellor Angela Merkel said in her annual news conference that US complaints only take into account the trade in good. When trade in services and repatriation of profits are included the figures favour the US, she said. She criticised the tit for tat tariffs imposed or threatened by the US and China: We see these potential tariffs both as a breach of WTO rules and also as a danger to the prosperity of many in the world. Back with the US, and Trump is continuing his attack on \u201cterrible\u201d trade deals: Over in Canada, inflation figures came in higher than forecast. The annual rate rose to 2.5% in June from 2.2% the previous month, more than the expected figure of 2.3%. This is the highest figure since February 2012. And so does the Federal Reserve again: Trump has now turned from trade wars back to currency wars, and this time Europe is getting it too. The latest Trump tariff attack on China at least keeps Europe on the sidelines for the moment, sayd Edward Rumble, co-manager of the RWC Continental European Equity fund. He said: The potential for more restrictive trade between nations may be a serious threat to global growth, and the steady increase in rhetoric and retaliatory actions was already worrying prior to today\u2019s latest comments. One thing for European investors to consider is that, if Trump is obsessed with China, it does at least temporarily keep his sights off Germany and other European nations. However, given Germany has a \u20ac100bn trade surplus with the US, at some stage he will likely come for them as well. Such actions represent a reversal of a 50-year trend to more liberal trade that has helped fuel economic prosperity around the world for decades. Not surprisingly, many companies are not well prepared for such a scenario, indeed they have been taking advantage of the open environment to optimise manufacturing efficiency on a global basis. In many cases, the current structure will not be optimal if trade barriers require local production in end markets to ensure competitiveness. The current escalation in trade war rhetoric makes sense in the context of November\u2019s mid=term elections, says Will Hobbs, head of investment Strategy at Barclays Smart Investor. He said: We cannot pretend to know for sure that this is all part of a crude negotiating strategy on the part of the US administration. However, today\u2019s sharp escalation makes sense in such a context, particularly with the midterm campaign trail on the horizon - The White House needs to force their opponents to swerve first in this game of trade chicken. On the other side, the political nature of the tariffs threatened to date, such as soybeans, suggests that the Chinese administration see a potential weakness in the President\u2019s approaching moment of indirect electoral accountability. As November\u2019s US midterm elections loom larger, we see economic and political self-interest helping to de-escalate the scrap. In the meantime, the potential for capital markets to be dragged into a disciplinary role suggests investors will again need to call upon their stores of composure to see this through. Olaf van den Heuvel, chief investment officer at Aegon Asset Management, warns that the US president risks destabilising the global economy, and the financial markets: \u201cSo far the Trump trade policy has been more about creating leverage in a negotiation than about levying actual tariffs. Of course, as in a game of poker, you sometimes have to up the ante. The risks are high at this level. The impact on world economic growth of a levy of this magnitude will be severe and will likely have a strong negative impact on markets.\u201d Donald Trump is adamant that he won\u2019t be knocked off course by stock market volatility. Wall Street is up around 30% since the 2016 presidential election, which Trump says gives him a cushion to challenge China et al on trade. He put it to CNBC: This is the time. You know the expression we\u2019re playing with the bank\u2019s money.\u201d Investor, though, will consider that it\u2019s their money, and fear that a trade war will wipe out their recent gains. European car shares are falling sharply, following president Trump\u2019s threat to deepen the trade dispute with China. Volkswagen are down 2.3%, and BMW have lost 1.5%, on fears that the US could impose tariffs on EU car imports soon. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says market sentiment has \u201csoured\u201d since Trump threatened to go \u2018whole hog\u2019 and impose tariffs on all $500B of Chinese imports to the US. Here\u2019s another clip, of Donald Trump explaining why he\u2019s \u201cnot thrilled\u201d that the US Federal Reserve keeps raising American interest rates: CNBC have now released a video clip of their interview with president Trump. In it, Trump claims that America is being \u201ctaken advantage of\u201d by China, the EU, Mexico, and Japan, because they all run trade surpluses with the US. Specifically on China, Trump says America is \u201cdown a tremendous amount\u201d - with a trade deficit of at least $375bn - and he\u2019s going to fix it. The president then threatens to put tariffs on all China\u2019s $500bn of imports, because Beijing retaliated against America\u2019s initial tariffs on $50bn of goods earlier this year. And he batted away the prospect that Wall Street might plunge if a trade war broke out. Here\u2019s the key quotes: Trump: \u201cI raised 50, and they matched us. I said: \u2018you don\u2019t match us, you can\u2019t match us because otherwise we\u2019re always gonna be behind the A ball\u2019.\u201d CNBC: \u201cWould you ever get to 500, though?\u201d Trump: \u201cI\u2019m ready to go to 500\u201d CNBC: With the mid-terms on the horizon? What if the stock market were to go down? Trump: If it does it does. CNBC: [what if it falls] 20%? Trump: I\u2019m doing this to do the right thing for our country. We have been ripped off by China for a long time. Here\u2019s the video clip: Trump\u2019s threat to launch a full-blooded trade war with China has alarmed investors. US stock market futures are falling, suggesting that shares will drop when trading begins in three hours. In London, the FTSE 100 is now in the red, down 30 points at 7652, having been slightly higher earlier. NEWSFLASH: CNBC are now broadcasting their full interview with president Trump (they only released the snippet attacking the Federal Reserve yesterday). The new top line? Trump is threatening to hit China with a new wave of tariffs, which would drive up the cost of ALL Chinese imports into America, worth around $500bn per year. Trump told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box show that \u201cI\u2019m ready to go to 500\u201d, if China doesn\u2019t bow to America\u2019s complaints about its trade policies. He added: I\u2019m not doing this for politics, I\u2019m doing this to do the right thing for our country..... We have been ripped off by China for a long time.\u201d Trump denied that he is acting maliciously towards China, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want them to be scared. I want them to do well...I really like President Xi a lot, but it was very unfair.\u201d So far, America has imposed 10% tariffs on $34bn of Chinese imports (which could soon rise to $50bn). Another $200bn of goods (including food, chemicals and consumer goods) could be hit by 10% levies in September. So far, China has announced reciprocal tariffs on America\u2019s first wave of penalties. However, it couldn\u2019t retaliate if Trump \u201cgoes to 500\u201d, as it only buys less than $200bn of US goods each year. Donald Trump should blame himself, not the Federal Reserve, for the strengthening dollar, argues Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA. Erlam writes that Trump\u2019s recent tax cuts have stimulated the US economy, at a time when it was doing pretty well anyway...... It\u2019s quite clear to most people that part of the reason for the Fed raising rates at the current pace is the tax reform measures passed at the end of last year, when the economy was already running hot. This is also partially responsible for the dollar rising against other currencies, particularly the yuan and euro, which has suffered further as the President has sought to start a trade war with both. Trump is not one to accept responsibility for such events and now appears to be actively trying to push the blame onto others in a clear attempt to halt the rise in the greenback, the strengthening of which could weigh on the economy and soften the impact of the trade measures he is taking against other countries. Reuters points out that Donald Trump has made several public comments about the dollar\u2019s strength since taking office....something most US leaders have avoided. Back in the UK, the long task of fixing the public finances continues. New figures show that Britain borrowed \u00a35.4bn to balance the books in June 2018, \u00a3800m less than in June 2017. So far this financial year, the UK has borrowed \u00a316.8bn; \u00a35.4bn less than in the same period in 2017, and the lowest April-June borrowing since 2007 (before the financial crisis). Mike Jakeman of PwC reckons this gives the government some ammunition to cut taxes or boost spending in the autumn Budget. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management has a deliciously acerbic take on Trump\u2019s attack on the Fed: US President Trump signalled unhappiness with Federal Reserve rate increases. This was in a TV interview, not a tweet, so it is not official administration policy. The decline of global inflation in the past quarter century was nothing to do with globalization, and nothing to do with technology. It was due mainly to central bank independence. Challenging independence is high risk. The Fed, even when run by a lawyer rather than a properly qualified economist, is not likely to alter policy direction. The Fed should tighten because deficit-financed tax cuts at a time of strong growth are unnecessary and need to be offset. However, US President Trump\u2019s recent consumer tax increases [tariffs] may slow the economy and reduce the need for rapid rate rises. It\u2019s important to emphasise that Trump\u2019s criticism of the Federal Reserve is pretty unusual. The whole point of central bank independence is that interest rates can rise or fall without political interference. That prevents governments from slashing borrowing costs to get a pre-election boom, creating an inflationary spike, forcing rates to go up again, slowing the economy, creating a recession.... Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, says Trump is acting more like the leader of an emerging market economy when he declares that he\u2019s \u201cnot thrilled\u201d by US interest rate rises. Hordijk writes: The US dollar sold off across the globe [after Trump\u2019s attack] and the question on every FX trader\u2019s mind is; is the US becoming the new Turkey? \u201cThe answer seems, \u201cno, but....\u201d. The Turkish lira lost almost 30% of its value this year mostly because Turkish President Recep Erdo\u011fan is firmly set against higher rates (just like Trump) and is attacking the independence of the central bank (just like Trump). Erdo\u011fan is notorious for criticising Turkey\u2019s central bank, and calling for lower interest rates. Earlier this month he even put his son-in-law in charge of Turkey\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Trump hasn\u2019t reached that point (Jared Kushner has other duties, anyway). Hordijk says: The big difference however is that the institutions in both countries widely differ and there are miles more of legal obstacles and checks and balances in place before Trump even gets close to have a direct say in the Fed\u2019s interest rate policy. Additionally Erdogan seems surrounded by a group of yes men, while Trump\u2019s team sometimes still keep him in check, as evidenced by Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders who went into damage control mode after the comments were made and reconfirmed Trump respects the independence of the Fed. But even so, Trump\u2019s decision to fire a warning shot at the Fed should worry the markets... After starting a trade war, giving tax hand outs to the rich that will likely blow up the US fiscal deficit and antagonizing NATO allies while befriending despotic leaders, this latest action of Trump further establishes the pattern of his capricious, often short term focus. That in itself is a scary observation and an understandable reason why the dollar sold off.\u201d President Trump has set \u201cmore cats among even more pigeons\u201d with his comments about interest rates and the dollar yesterday. So says Kit Juckes, foreign exchange expert at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Juckes doesn\u2019t believe the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence is now in doubt. And as long as [Fed chair] Jay Powell &amp; Co respond to a strong economy and easy fiscal policy with measured policy tightening, they aren\u2019t going to send bond yields or the dollar down on their own. However, he also expects more fireworks if China allows its currency to keep sliding: As long as the renminbi is falling in an orderly manner, there is little urgency for the Chinese authorities to counter it. Whether or not China is wittingly undertaking a depreciation policy, the question will increasingly be on investors\u2019 minds as the slide deepens. And the Trump Administration is unlikely to keep quiet for long either The Trump administration is determined to push down their currency, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. A cheaper dollar would help US companies compete abroad, a key plank of Trump\u2019s attempt to make trade \u2018fairer\u2019. Wilson writes: A clear pattern is emerging \u2013 Donald Trump wants a weaker dollar. Prior to his inauguration he said the dollar was \u2018too strong\u2019. Then earlier this year Treasury secretary Mnuchin echoed those comments when he openly questioned the strong dollar policy. The Mnuchin effect lasted until the middle of April, but since then the dollar has been on the rise again, with the dollar index hitting 95, a level not seen since November last year. When you look at the trade policies he\u2019s pursuing, a weaker dollar makes sense. The only problem is that an all-out trade war, by making dollars scarcer, will force up the greenback against its peers. Trump\u2019s intervention raises the dangers of a full-blown currency war, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group. He says China\u2019s response - letting the yuan weaken sharply - is significant. As Trump moaned about the strength of the dollar, the PBOC devalued the yuan by the most since 2016, sending a chill through the markets. Interpreted as China\u2019s response to the US trade war \u2013 the starting of a currency war- risk off is prevailing with traders selling out of equities sending Asian markets and European futures sharply lower. It was only a month ago when China denied that they would start a currency war following Trump\u2019s action. A lot can change in a month under Trump. Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the Fed came after the US dollar hit a one-year high against a basket of other major currencies. The dollar has strengthened thanks to several US interest rate rises, and the prospect of more to come. US interest rates are now 2% - up from just 0.25% after the financial crisis - with the Fed likely to push through two more quarter-point increases this year. In contrast, eurozone interest rates are zero, while the UK Bank Rate is just 0.5%. Trump singled out China for particular criticism last night, saying it was letting the yuan drop \u201clike a rock\u201d. So he won\u2019t be pleased by Beijing\u2019s response \u2013 the People\u2019s Bank of China let the yuan hit a new one-year low today, fixing the currency at 6.7671 per dollar. That\u2019s nearly 1% weaker than Thursday\u2019s fix. The yuan then tumbled lower in nervous trading, hitting 6.812 to the dollar. That prompted a reaction; Chinese banks began buying the yuan and selling dollars, apparently in an attempt to prop the currency up. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With trade war fears mounting and Brexit looming, investors already have plenty to worry about. But Donald Trump has added a new anxiety -- currency wars. Overnight, the US president launched a rare attack on America\u2019s central bankers, revealing that he wasn\u2019t happy with their plans to raise US interest rates. Trump claimed that the Federal Reserve risked undermining all his good work strengthening the economy. He told CNBC that higher borrowing costs would drive up the dollar, especially as other central banks are keeping policy loose. \u201cI don\u2019t really \u2014 I am not happy about it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like all of this work that we\u2019re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up.\u201d You could almost hear Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s eyebrows rising sharply as Trump\u2019s comments hit the wires. Central bank independence is a serious issue - policymakers are meant to navigate the economic squalls and storms free from political interference. But Trump clearly doesn\u2019t play by the rules, so traders now have to calculate whether White House pressure is going to influence the path of interest rates. And if so, is that going to set off a currency war? Powell may feel Trump\u2019s criticism is particularly misplaced, as the president\u2019s tax-cutting agenda is putting pressure on the Fed to act, to prevent a dangerous inflationary bubble. Trump insisted that Powell was a \u201cvery good man\u201d, but even so the president \u201cwasn\u2019t thrilled\u201d about the prospect of further interest rate hikes. The White House tried to row back on Trump\u2019s comments, insisting that he respected the independence of the Fed. But still, his intervention hit the markets, as CNBC explains: Financial markets across the globe whipsawed on Trump\u2019s comments. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar\u2019s performance against a basket of six other currencies, fell from a one-year high and traded just below breakeven. U.S. equities edged off their session lows, but remained lower on the day. Also coming up today June\u2019s UK public finances are released this morning. The City predicts that Britain borrowed around \u00a35bn to balance the books last month, much the same as in May. 9.30am BST: UK public finances for June 1.30pm BST: Canadian inflation figures",

But still, his intervention hit the markets, as CNBC explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Financial markets across the globe whipsawed on Trump\u2019s comments.</p> \n   <p>The dollar index, which tracks the dollar\u2019s performance against a basket of six other currencies, fell from a one-year high and traded just below breakeven.

      "bodyText": "House of Fraser is facing a legal challenge from a group of landlords over a plan to close more than half its stores by next spring. The landlords, who filed a complaint via the court of session in Edinburgh on Friday, say that they were \u201cunfairly prejudiced\u201d during an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) that was approved by a majority of creditors, including landlords, last month. The group, who are being advised by accountancy firm Begbies Traynor and property advisory firm JLL, also allege there were \u201cmaterial irregularities in the implementation of the House of Fraser CVA\u201d. The CVA plan involves the closure of 31 of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 department stores, including the flagship in London\u2019s Oxford Street. The closures will result in about 6,000 job losses from the 17,000-strong workforce and the company has warned the only alternative is to go into administration. The statement from the landlord group said it was \u201cunjust\u201d that House of Fraser\u2019s majority shareholder, Nanjing Cenbest, which is part of China\u2019s Sanpower conglomerate, was set to receive \u00a370m for some of its shares in the ailing department store from a new investor, C.banner, as part of a wider rescue deal while landlords creditors take a financial hit. \u201cIt is our view, and that of our legal counsel, that landlords have been disproportionately affected during this CVA process; not only compared to other creditors, but also to how they could have been treated if alternative routes to rescuing the business were fully explored,\u201d the group said in a statement. They complained that they had not been properly consulted about the CVA or given sufficient information about how House of Fraser planned to trade over the coming months. The legal action is seen as a fightback by landlords against the increasing use of CVAs, which have become commonplace in recent months, with a string of struggling retail and restaurant businesses using them to offload unwanted outlets or cut rents. \u201cCVAs were designed as a means to rescue a business, not simply a tool to shed undesirable leases for the benefit of equity shareholders,\u201d said Mark Fry of Begbies Traynor and Charlotte Coates of JLL. \u201cIt is our collective view that the retail CVA process in the UK has become fundamentally flawed and needs correcting.\u201d The CVA is a prerequisite of an investment deal that C.banner agreed with Nanjing Cenbest, chaired by one of China\u2019s richest men, Yuan Yafei. C.banner has agreed to pay Nanjing Cenbest \u00a370m as part of the deal, which will give it a 51% stake in House of Fraser. It has also pledged to invest a further \u00a370m into the department store\u2019s revival plan. A House of Fraser spokesperson said: \u201cWe note the statement made by Begbies Traynor and JLL on behalf of a group of landlords but at this stage we have not received anything formally. On the assumption that a challenge is filed in court, whilst we are disappointed, we look forward to robustly defending our position and we are confident that this will not affect our commercial plans.\u201d",

The 150g bar was reduced from 170g in 2016 as a way to keep prices steady at about \u00a31 a bar. The gappy new version was likened to a bicycle rack. That bar is now being replaced with a new version weighing 33% more, but the price could rise by more than 200%. One retailing source said that the new 200g bar\u2019s recommended selling price is \u00a33.09, although big supermarkets and large retail chains will be able to sell the bars on promotion at \u00a32-\u00a32.50.

At the time of the 2016 change Glenn Caton, president of the northern Europe division of Toblerone\u2019s parent company Mondelez, said that the wider gaps were only a \u201cshort-term solution\u201d and \u201cnot the right thing for the long term because of the iconic nature of the product\u201d. A Mondelez spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re always reviewing our range to make sure we provide great quality Swiss chocolate in formats we know our fans love. The 150g Toblerone is no longer being manufactured and therefore availability of the bar depends on how much stock an individual retailer is carrying. But 100g and 360g size bars will still be available.\u201d The change in shape and price, first reported by The Grocer trade journal, means that Poundland will no longer stock the bars. Toblerones are the discount chain\u2019s most popular product and it sold 12m of them last year. Poundland said that stocks would run low within weeks. The discounter said it would respond by bringing back a redesigned version of Twin Peaks, its Toblerone copycat bar, at the end of the summer. Poundland sold half a million of the lookalikes earlier this year but has been forced to redesign it after a legal battle with the Swiss original\u2019s owners. Chocolate makers began tweaking the size of chocolate bars two years ago after a surge in the price of cocoa. While prices fell in 2017, Carlos Mera, a commodity analyst at Rabobank, said the cost of cocoa had risen 23% in the past year to more than \u00a317 per kg. He said the commodity had surged in recent months because of a crackdown on illegal plantations in Ivory Coast, the world\u2019s biggest cocoa grower, as well as increased demand for chocolate around the world. \u201cGlobally, chocolate consumption, especially that with high cocoa content, which is regarded as healthier, is up,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "In 2013, as the craft ale craze took off, TV producer Dan Clapton decided to try selling bottled beer on a stall at the Sunday market in the east London suburb of Wanstead. To his surprise he sold out and soon he was looking for premises. Rents on Wanstead high street were too high so Clapton opted for a railway arch in Forest Gate, Wanstead\u2019s less well-heeled neighbour. The Wanstead Tap opened in early 2014 as a beer shop and cafe. Partly by chance and partly by design, it has morphed into one of the many cultural and social hubs that have sprung up in changing communities \u2013 from the Kent coast to Glasgow. During the day, community groups, charities, environmental groups and cycling clubs use Clapton\u2019s venue at no charge for meetings and fundraisers. Up to 500 people come to the Tap\u2019s quarterly street market for local artists. In the evenings it is an 80-seat venue for gigs by musicians, comedians and writers. \u201cI thought, let\u2019s do something with this space,\u201d Clapton said, sitting on a leather sofa outside the arch. \u201cIt felt like a room above an old-fashioned pub where you could have neighbourhood meetings. People started approaching me saying: \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea \u2013 let\u2019s do stuff.\u2019\u201d Clapton is waiting for the arrival of Kenney Jones, once the drummer for the Small Faces, the Faces and, after Keith Moon\u2019s death, the Who. Jones is coming to talk about his autobiography, Let the Good Times Roll, to a sellout audience. Outside the Tap the local Newham Bookshop sells copies of Jones\u2019s book for signing. Other writers who have appeared at the Tap include Viv Albertine of the Slits and Misha Glenny, whose book McMafia spawned the recent TV series. The Tap has also hosted comedians such as Rich Hall, Sara Pascoe and Alexei Sayle. Forest Gate is changing as middle-class families move in, attracted by relatively cheap houses and the imminent opening of the Crossrail station. \u201cProspective new residents come in almost weekly and tell us the Tap is a factor in them coming to Forest Gate,\u201d Clapton says. As Clapton was trying out his beer stall, Humbi Pena was going stir crazy selling records on eBay from his family\u2019s home in Ramsgate, Kent. He decided to branch out by opening a record shop and cafe in the seaside town. Four years on, Vinyl Head serves a mix of locals and newer arrivals attracted by Ramsgate\u2019s creative scene and affordable houses. It serves food and hosts community groups, language classes, music, poetry and art events. \u201cWe have mums and kids, creative people and the older generation who use the cafe as a community hub,\u201d Pena says. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where people talk to each other.\u201d Down the road in Margate, Cliffs also combines a record shop with food and cultural events as well as yoga, pilates and children\u2019s dance classes. The Tap, Vinyl Head and Cliffs are part of a wave of independent venues that are focal points for community and artistic activity \u2013 often filling a cultural gap to offer activities and events to new arrivals looking for affordable family homes. When Brett Rehling and his wife, Tracey Fletcher, opened Kitchen Garden Cafe in the Birmingham suburb of Kings Heath in 2006 friends feared the worst. \u201cPeople said: \u2018Why are you doing it in Kings Heath?\u2019\u201d Rehling said. \u201cThe high street was full of charity shops, betting shops and greasy spoon cafes. No one went out in Kings Heath.\u201d Their cafe, garden centre and gift shop became a focal point for families arriving from pricier Moseley, helping turn Kings Heath into one of Birmingham\u2019s buzziest areas. The cafe\u2019s main focus is music and it holds about three gigs a week, ranging from local musicians to international names such as Texas singer songwriter Beth Nielsen Chapman. Glad Cafe in Glasgow\u2019s South Side and Deli Lama in Salford opened in 2012 in neighbourhoods with no local venue. Both have become favourites with growing artistic communities and locals who previously headed for the city centre for a cultural fix. Rachel Smillie, Glad Cafe\u2019s owner, said: \u201cA lot of people say Glad Cafe is responsible for making the area more creative and trendy but I think the time was right.\u201d But can these labours of love make money? Yes but only with a great deal of perseverance and hard work. Clapton pays his mortgage by keeping his job as the producer for Come Dine With Me. The Tap made a few hundred pounds profit last year after he paid staff and performers, invested in equipment and coughed up a 50% rent increase to Network Rail. Despite its role in transforming the neighbourhood, Glad Cafe struggles to stay afloat. Linda Robson, who owns Deli Lama, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle. We weren\u2019t on people\u2019s radar and it was hard work to get people through the door but it gets better every year. We have got loyal and dedicated customers.\u201d Wanstead Tap Clapton rejects the term gentrification. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought life here,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we opened there were drug dealers on the corner making local residents unhappy. Within a week they were gone because they were too exposed.\u201d Vinyl Head Building Ramsgate\u2019s cultural hub has taken its toll on Pena. He is selling the cafe to open a dedicated record shop next door though he expects the businesses to work together. \u201cAll we talked about at home was the next event,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was overwhelming.\u201d Kitchen Garden Cafe As well as music, the cafe\u2019s activities include a monthly all-women comedy night and selling local art. Ingredients come from the cafe\u2019s garden. On a gig day Rehling works 16 hours. \u201cThe music is my passion. I\u2019m working but it\u2019s something I want to do.\u201d Glad Cafe The cafe is a social enterprise and has an exhibition space for local artists, an 80-strong local choir and puts on up to six gigs a week. \u201cMusicians coming from Europe, America or Africa will call up and say: \u2018Can you do these dates,\u2019\u201d Smillie says. Deli Lama Former community worker Robson opened the cafe on rundown Chapel Street because she believed the area deserved its own venue. The cafe supports Salford producers and artists and holds gigs by local musicians. \u201cWe get a lot of students, artists and people who have lived in Salford all their lives,\u201d she says.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sterling\u2019s plunge after the Brexit vote helped attract record numbers of overseas visitors to Britain last year, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said visits to the UK by overseas residents reached 39.2m last year, while also finding more Brits than ever before heading abroad \u2013 suggesting hopes for a staycation boom may have been overblown. Helping hotels, travel companies and tourist attractions across the country during a broader slowdown for the British economy in 2017, the number of visits by holidaymakers, business travellers and people coming to see friends and family rose from 37.6m in 2016. VisitBritain said the country benefited from higher numbers of people travelling from China, the US, Australia and the Gulf states, while overseas travellers opened their wallets to spend more than \u00a324.5bn. While London remains the most popular destination, visits outside the capital reached a record high of 16.5m last year, with tourists spending \u00a37.8bn in other UK locations. Aside from direct spending, the government\u2019s tourism authority believes visitors to the UK generate a total of \u00a3127bn for the economy each year. Alongside the rise in numbers from further afield, there was also an increase in the number of Europeans coming to the UK. Europe remains the most important market for the British tourism industry, accounting for more than two-thirds of all visitors. France was the number one country for visits to the UK, with almost 4m last year. Despite significant pressure on household budgets, with Britons facing falling real wages and the highest levels of inflation for five years triggered by the Brexit vote, the ONS said more Brits than ever before jetted off on holiday, went on business trips or visited friends and family abroad. There had been hopes of a staycation boom, as the weak pound made staying on a campsite in Cornwall or bothy in Scotland more attractive. However, the ONS said the number of visits overseas by UK residents rose to 72.8m \u2013 an increase of 3% and nearly double the number of visits to the UK from overseas. Britons spent more than \u00a344.8bn while on visits abroad. However, the weak pound does appear to have discouraged Brits from shelling out for long-haul trips to destinations like the US, with the figures showing the first drop in overall visits from Britain for several years. In the first year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, visits from Britain fell to 3.4m, from almost 3.6m in 2016. Spain accounted for much of the increase in trips abroad, with visits to the most popular British holiday destination rising by more than a million to reach almost 15.9m last year. Holidaymakers and other British travellers spent more than \u00a38.6bn in Spanish resorts, cities and regions last year.

      "bodyText": "The Fearless Girl is on the move. The bronze sculpture of a little girl defiantly facing off against Wall Street\u2019s Charging Bull launched a million selfies and became an unlikely avatar of the #MeToo movement. Soon it will be transported a few hundred metres down the road in downtown Manhattan to confront another symbol of entrenched masculinity: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Stacey Cunningham says she couldn\u2019t be more delighted. \u201cI think she\u2019s fantastic,\u201d says Cunningham, the 67th president of the NYSE and the first woman to head the male-dominated institution in its 226-year history. \u201cFor me, she is a message to individuals, though. I think we need to call ourselves to action, especially as women, not to hold ourselves back.\u201d Cunningham may be a fan of Fearless Girl, but she is not as happy with the gender-focused attention drawn by her elevation to one of the most high-profile jobs in finance. She gives a small, hard smile when asked about the coverage. She should not really be surprised. The number of women running businesses, let alone institutions of the stature of the NYSE, is still small. And the number of women running the US\u2019s top 500 companies \u2013 many listed on the NYSE \u2013 fell this year. The floor of the stock exchange itself is also still a sausage fest. It is less male than it has been in the past, but that is because the number of men has been hacked away by technology, not diversity. The majority of the women on the exchange\u2019s floor seem to be working for the 30-plus media outlets based there. Cunningham, 43, has been at the exchange on and off (and mostly on) since the 1990s. She says her surprise at the attention her appointment has brought may be because, in retrospect, she has always been gender-blind. \u201cI always liked maths, science and problem-solving, so I gravitated towards engineering,\u201d says Cunningham, who grew up in New Jersey, the fourth child of six, three boys, three girls. (\u201cI\u2019m the well-adjusted middle child,\u201d she says.) She says she is disappointed that more girls don\u2019t go into science and maths, but in her own case it was the obvious choice: \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that at all.\u201d When Cunningham was at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, studying industrial engineering, one of her sisters asked her to report back on the date-worthiness of the boys in her class. \u201cAs I looked around the classroom, I realised I was the only girl in the class \u2013 and I had been in that class for weeks. I had no idea that I was the only girl in the class, because I just didn\u2019t see it,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s been a consistent theme. Until about four weeks ago [now two months ago, when she was appointed], when it was actually hard to tune out the fact that I\u2019m a woman in this industry.\u201d She must have had to tune out a lot. She first entered the NYSE in 1994 as an intern, when she was one of about 30 women among 1,000 men. \u201cI walked in and right away I fell in love with the place,\u201d she says. The \u201cenergy and the pace\u201d reminded her of her family. \u201cWhat struck me right away was the sense of community.\u201d After she graduated, she came back to the NYSE, working on the trading floor until 2005, when she took time off to complete a culinary training course. She then worked at a rival stock exchange, the Nasdaq, as director of capital markets, before rejoining the NYSE and becoming the exchange\u2019s chief operating officer in 2015. She acknowledges that things have changed for women at the NYSE in the decades since she first worked here. For one, they have proper bathrooms. When she started, women had to make do with one tiny bathroom converted from a phone booth, while the men\u2019s bathrooms had a palatial lounge area. But she never experienced the rampant sexism other women in finance have complained about, she says. \u201cWhen you walked through a trading floor 20 years ago as a woman, there was a little bit of you that could feel the room looking at you,\u201d she says. But she says she never experienced any behaviour that made her uncomfortable. \u201cIn my experience, if I said to somebody: \u2018Hey, that\u2019s not OK, too much,\u2019 and I said it with a smile, too, then they knew,\u201d she says, giving that tight little smile again. \u201cWhether it was the language people used, or something else that I didn\u2019t appreciate, I just made it clear where I stood and I felt that I was respected for it. I\u2019m not saying that every woman would have had that same experience. I\u2019m sure there are women who tried to draw lines and they were ignored. I was fortunate that when I drew lines people stayed outside them.\u201d Cunningham takes over the top spot at a challenging moment for the NYSE. Some of that is on view during my visit. I arrive for the opening bell that marks the beginning of the trading day and is a fixture of the financial news cable TV shows. We are corralled into a holding pen in line of the TV cameras as Cunningham rings the bell, alongside executives from BJ\u2019s, a discount warehouse retailer, who are celebrating the launch of its share sale on the NYSE. The mood is frenetic, celebratory, somewhere between a graduation and the start of a race. But the energy is inside the corral, generated by the people who work for BJ\u2019s, the exchange or the media organisations that report from the floor. Outside the pen, the number of brokers employed on the NYSE\u2019s vast floor is in the hundreds, not the thousands of years gone by. You leave with the impression things will be pretty quiet once the opening ceremony is over. Most stock trading is now done electronically, principally from a far less photogenic datacentre in New Jersey. Its critics claim the exchange is a dog and pony show \u2013 Disneyland for capitalism, a marketing exercise where CEOs can ring a bell and a few traders run about looking busy for the cameras while the algorithms do the real work. \u201cThat floor is a TV station,\u201d says one senior Wall Street executive, who did not want to be named. \u201cThere is pomp and circumstance, but it\u2019s nothing but a bunch of clapping seals.\u201d Cunningham and the NYSE could not disagree more. Algorithms cannot compete with human discernment and experience, or with days of big news. Cunningham mentions the day of the Brexit vote, for example \u2013 the human touch helped calm jitters. People bring \u201cjudgment\u201d, she says. \u201cOne analogy we often use to describe how people add to that equation is an airline pilot. So, a plane can take off and land without a pilot. You don\u2019t need to have a human being in the cockpit. But that human being adds value, especially during the most tumultuous times,\u201d she says. Frankly, however, the argument over whether or not the NYSE\u2019s much photographed neoclassical facade is sheltering a marketing operation or a vital financial institution is the least of its problems. One issue for all the exchanges, but the NYSE in particular, is that there are fewer and fewer share sales like that of BJ\u2019s. Big companies such as Uber, Airbnb and WeWork are choosing to stay private for longer, powered by huge piles of private equity money. Rival exchanges are also chipping away at the NYSE and other establishment players. The NYSE accounts for about 22% of stocks traded in the US, but that is down from about one-third of trading in 2009. It now competes with dozens of less high-profile trading platforms, such as the \u201cdark pools\u201d (exchanges run in-house by big banks such as Goldman Sachs that account for 40% of trading); Nasdaq, its closest competitor, where tech companies including Apple and Facebook are listed; the Chicago Board Options Exchange; and IEX, the exchange set up by Brad Katsuyama, a central character in Michael Lewis\u2019s book Flash Boys, about high-speed traders. The competition \u2013 and some investors \u2013 are pressing the NYSE and the Nasdaq on their fees, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US\u2019s main financial watchdog, has a pilot scheme under review that aims to assess how, and if, the complex system of fees and rebates the NYSE and others pay to brokers for trading on their exchange affects trading. Critics argue that the rebates on broking fees offered by the NYSE and others to encourage traders to use their market create a conflict of interest. They incentivise brokers to send their customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest ones, even if their clients might be better served elsewhere. The two-year pilot, which has the support of some huge pension funds, would allow the SEC to assess their impact on how trades are made. But Cunningham says the scheme is poorly designed \u2013 it does not include the dark pools, for example \u2013 and the Nasdaq has hinted that it may sue to stop the scheme. It is a complicated issue, but one that will require Cunningham to spend more of her time in Washington. \u201cThe biggest worry for her is that the regulatory tailwinds are going the other way,\u201d said Ronan Ryan, the president of IEX. Ryan, who runs a rival exchange that has been involved in a public spat with the NYSE over the fees study, says the NYSE is too dependent on the fees it charges for data and is on the wrong side over rebates. \u201cWhen you have all of your constituents annoyed about how you are extracting money from the street, it\u2019s unsustainable,\u201d he says. \u201cLook, in 2002, Blockbuster was a video rental store, but something like 70% of their profits came from charging late fees. That was obviously not a sustainable model. I think there\u2019s a correlation to this.\u201d There is no air of crisis at the NYSE, which has dismissed IEX as an exchange with a \u201cclearly failing\u201d business model. And Cunningham does not believe the NYSE is in trouble. The financial world may be changing \u2013 and fast \u2013 but the NYSE remains the world\u2019s most famous stock market. She is confident it can adapt and keep its pre-eminent position. \u201cThe future of equity markets is increasingly global, technology-focused and data-driven,\u201d she said. In that world, she believes the NYSE \u201cis uniquely positioned\u201d to leverage its huge footprint, and technology, to stay ahead of the pack. On a brief tour of the recently refurbished NYSE \u2013 it looks like a particularly nice outpost of the luxury hotel chain W Hotel \u2013 we pop into a room full of portraits of past presidents \u2013 all pale males. One day, Cunningham will be up there, too. It is quite a first, even if she does not seem keen to acknowledge it. Perhaps Fearless Girl will ensure she is not the last.",

I was fortunate that when I drew lines people stayed outside them.\u201d</p> <p>Cunningham takes over the top spot at a challenging moment for the NYSE. Some of that is on view during my visit. I arrive for the opening bell that marks the beginning of the trading day and is a fixture of the financial news cable TV shows. We are corralled into a holding pen in line of the TV cameras as Cunningham rings the bell, alongside executives from BJ\u2019s, a discount warehouse retailer, who are celebrating the launch of its share sale on the NYSE.</p> <p>The mood is frenetic, celebratory, somewhere between a graduation and the start of a race. But the energy is inside the corral, generated by the people who work for BJ\u2019s, the exchange or the media organisations that report from the floor. Outside the pen, the number of brokers employed on the NYSE\u2019s vast floor is in the hundreds, not the thousands of years gone by. You leave with the impression things will be pretty quiet once the opening ceremony is over.</p> <p>Most stock trading is now done electronically, principally from a far less photogenic datacentre in New Jersey. Its critics claim the exchange is a dog and pony show \u2013 Disneyland for capitalism, a marketing exercise where CEOs can ring a bell and a few traders run about looking busy for the cameras while the algorithms do the real work.</p> <p>\u201cThat floor is a TV station,\u201d says one senior Wall Street executive, who did not want to be named. \u201cThere is pomp and circumstance, but it\u2019s nothing but a bunch of clapping seals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f5e7555aa042c5d776e3d339ac5cdc53e16efa7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f5e7555aa042c5d776e3d339ac5cdc53e16efa7/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey Cunningham on the floor of the NYSE\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What struck me right away was the sense of community\u2019 ... Cunningham on the floor of the NYSE.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cunningham and the NYSE could not disagree more. Algorithms cannot compete with human discernment and experience, or with days of big news. Cunningham mentions the day of the Brexit vote, for example \u2013 the human touch helped calm jitters. People bring \u201cjudgment\u201d, she says. \u201cOne analogy we often use to describe how people add to that equation is an airline pilot. So, a plane can take off and land without a pilot. You don\u2019t need to have a human being in the cockpit. But that human being adds value, especially during the most tumultuous times,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Frankly, however, the argument over whether or not the NYSE\u2019s much photographed neoclassical facade is sheltering a marketing operation or a vital financial institution is the least of its problems.</p> <p>One issue for all the exchanges, but the NYSE in particular, is that there are fewer and fewer share sales like that of BJ\u2019s. Big companies such as Uber, Airbnb and WeWork are choosing to stay private for longer, powered by huge piles of private equity money.</p> <p>Rival exchanges are also chipping away at the NYSE and other establishment players. The NYSE accounts for about 22% of stocks traded in the US, but that is down from about one-third of trading in 2009. It now competes with dozens of less high-profile trading platforms, such as the \u201cdark pools\u201d (exchanges run in-house by big banks such as Goldman Sachs that account for 40% of trading); Nasdaq, its closest competitor, where tech companies including Apple and Facebook are listed; the Chicago Board Options Exchange; and IEX, the exchange set up by Brad Katsuyama, a central character in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/03/michael-lewis-i-knew-flash-boys-would-be-a-bombshell\">Michael Lewis\u2019s book Flash Boys</a>, about high-speed traders.</p> <p>The competition \u2013 and some investors \u2013 are pressing the NYSE and the Nasdaq on their fees, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US\u2019s main financial watchdog, has a pilot scheme under review that aims to assess how, and if, the complex system of fees and rebates the NYSE and others pay to brokers for trading on their exchange affects trading.</p> <p>Critics argue that the rebates on broking fees offered by the NYSE and others to encourage traders to use their market create a conflict of interest. They incentivise brokers to send their customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest ones, even if their clients might be better served elsewhere.</p> <p>The two-year pilot, which has the support of some huge pension funds, would allow the SEC to assess their impact on how trades are made. But Cunningham says the scheme is poorly designed \u2013 it does not include the dark pools, for example \u2013 and the Nasdaq has hinted that it may sue to stop the scheme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df6e62a312fb2873ede0fe20856eeb072627b50e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6e62a312fb2873ede0fe20856eeb072627b50e/0_382_5941_3565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cunningham and executives from BJ\u2019s ring the exchange\u2019s bell to announce the wholesale retailer\u2019s share sale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sound investment ... Cunningham and executives from BJ\u2019s ring the exchange\u2019s bell to announce the wholesale retailer\u2019s share sale.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a complicated issue, but one that will require Cunningham to spend more of her time in Washington.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest worry for her is that the regulatory tailwinds are going the other way,\u201d said Ronan Ryan, the president of IEX. Ryan, who runs a rival exchange that has been involved in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-05-18/s70518-4022871-167340.pdf\">a public spat with the NYSE over the fees study</a>, says the NYSE is too dependent on the fees it charges for data and is on the wrong side over rebates.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have all of your constituents annoyed about how you are extracting money from the street, it\u2019s unsustainable,\u201d he says. \u201cLook, in 2002, Blockbuster was a video rental store, but something like 70% of their profits came from charging late fees. That was obviously not a sustainable model. I think there\u2019s a correlation to this.\u201d</p> <p>There is no air of crisis at the NYSE, which has dismissed IEX as an exchange with a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-05-18/s70518-4022871-167340.pdf\">\u201cclearly failing\u201d</a> business model.</p> <p>And Cunningham does not believe the NYSE is in trouble. The financial world may be changing \u2013 and fast \u2013 but the NYSE remains the world\u2019s most famous stock market. She is confident it can adapt and keep its pre-eminent position.</p> <p>\u201cThe future of equity markets is increasingly global, technology-focused and data-driven,\u201d she said. In that world, she believes the NYSE \u201cis uniquely positioned\u201d to leverage its huge footprint, and technology, to stay ahead of the pack.</p> <p>On a brief tour of the recently refurbished NYSE \u2013 it looks like a particularly nice outpost of the luxury hotel chain W Hotel \u2013 we pop into a room full of portraits of past presidents \u2013 all pale males. One day, Cunningham will be up there, too. It is quite a first, even if she does not seem keen to acknowledge it. Perhaps Fearless Girl will ensure she is not the last.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Weak economic growth and sluggish tax revenues prevented the government from reducing its spending deficit in June by as much as anticipated, squeezing the chancellor\u2019s ability to revive ailing public services in the autumn budget. City analysts expected the deficit to decline by more than \u00a31bn compared with June 2017, following a steep fall in interest payments on the government\u2019s total debt bill and a cut in EU budget contributions the Treasury sends to Brussels. However, those hopes were dashed by a fall in the tax revenue growth that mirrors the weaker state of the economy this year. As a result, the deficit was reduced by \u00a3800m year on year. Closing the deficit at a faster rate would have created more room for Philip Hammond to meet Theresa May\u2019s promise of an extra \u00a320bn a year in public healthcare funding, phased in over the next five years. The chancellor has said he will explain how this will be funded in his autumn budget statement. However, the fall in public sector net borrowing, excluding public sector banks, to \u00a35.4bn in June from the \u00a36.2bn registered in the same month last year, was a bigger improvement than predicted by official forecasters. In its gloomy prediction for the coming year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, expects only a marginal improvement in the government spending deficit, mostly in response to the ongoing Brexit negotiations. In March, the OBR said it expected the shortfall between how much the government spends and how much it earns from tax revenues to fall this financial year to \u00a337.1bn, or 1.8% of GDP. Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said with borrowing in March, April and June down 25% on the previous year at \u00a316.8bn, the Treasury was on course to cut the annual total to \u00a329.7bn by next March, well below the OBR\u2019s \u00a337.1bn forecast. He said: \u201cBorrowing still is falling faster than the OBR expected, indicating that the chancellor should be able to change course in the autumn budget and give the economy a break from further spending cuts in 2019.\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the trend was likely to revert back to nearer the OBR\u2019s forecast. He argued that the reduction in borrowing was in part due to lower inflation, which meant lower interest payments on index-linked government bonds, and lower payments to the EU following a fall in GDP growth this year. Both are a signal of a weakening economic outlook that will reduce tax revenues further. Tax revenue growth fell to only 2.8% in the year to June, down from a forecast 3.6%, despite bumper rises in employment to a new record high this year. Tombs said Hammond was maintaining his deficit reduction programme largely by sticking to cuts in spending. \u201cLower-than-anticipated borrowing, then, reflects the government\u2019s success in controlling expenditure, not a reviving economy,\u201d he said. \u201cNonetheless, borrowing still should come in comfortably below the OBR\u2019s forecast this year. Given that the Conservatives now lag Labour in the opinion polls and Brexit must be seen to be a success, we see no reason why the chancellor wouldn\u2019t opt to soften his plans in the budget later this year. \u201cAccordingly, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that a neutral fiscal stance will enable the economy to gather a little pace next year, provided a no or hard Brexit is avoided,\u201d he added. Public debt, excluding the banks nationalised during the financial crisis, stood at \u00a31.792tn, or 85.2% of GDP, down from 86.2% of GDP in June 2017 but double its level before the crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Orna Ni-Chionna, head of remuneration at Royal Mail, is \u201cvery disappointed\u201d that 70% of voting shareholders think her pay report should be filed in the bin, along with the junk mail. The company will reflect \u201cvery carefully\u201d on their views. Then it will consult with them, again \u201cvery closely\u201d. Then it won\u2019t change a thing. The last part wasn\u2019t spelled out, naturally, but it\u2019s how the plot usually works when the resolution in front of shareholders is purely advisory. Even when two-thirds of investors are unhappy, the board is free to do nothing. The system is silly. On Moya Greene\u2019s \u00a3914,000 payoff, it\u2019s probably true that Royal Mail\u2019s hands are tied. The outgoing chief executive negotiated a contract with an automatic parachute payment when she was hired in the pre-privatisation days of 2010 and the terms can\u2019t be undone without her say-so. Blame Sir Vince Cable, business secretary at the time, or a former underling. But Ni-Chionna\u2019s crew are directly in the firing line for the other issue that excited the rebels. New chief executive Rico Back\u2019s basic salary of \u00a3640,000 will be almost \u00a3100,000 more than Greene\u2019s. Ah, says the company, he\u2019ll get a smaller pension allowance so his overall \u201cfixed cash\u201d package is the same. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t really wash, however, because bonuses and share incentives are set as multiples of salary and those multiples have been left unaltered. Thus Back\u2019s maximum jackpot could be about \u00a3250,000 more than Greene\u2019s. There is no good explanation for the inflation. Yet it\u2019s slightly odd that Royal Mail\u2019s pay report, judged by the number of revolting shareholders, is deemed the worst ever from a FTSE 100 company. The salaries and potential bonuses are enormous by ordinary standards, of course, but you\u2019ll find far worse elsewhere. When Persimmon\u2019s absurd incentive scheme awarded \u00a3100m to chief executive Jeff Fairburn, the housebuilder still scraped a 51% majority \u2013 even though the chairman and pay chief had resigned in embarrassment for their role in the fiasco. Therein lies another absurdity of the advisory voting system. Fund managers often find it easier to object on points of principle than unleash fury when the worst examples of executive greed are staring them in the face. It makes no sense. Sports Direct investments are mostly own-goals Sports Direct\u2019s corporate reputation is greatly improved, according to a third-party survey, so please don\u2019t spoil Mike Ashley\u2019s delight by pointing out that it\u2019s easier to rise from the depths. Now, when are the next stock-picker-of-the-year awards? In that competition, a booby prize surely awaits. Sports Direct has written down the value of its near-30% stake in Debenhams by \u00a385m, reflecting the crash in the beleaguered department store chain\u2019s share price. The sum is equivalent to slightly more than half Sports Direct\u2019s underlying pretax profits last year. Why take these share punts? The official reasoning is that \u201cstrategic investments are in an integral part of the group\u2019s strategy\u201d, yet the grand total of Sports Direct\u2019s commercial relationship with Debenhams amounts to two store-in-store concessions (there used to be nine). As for the supposed \u201cactive dialogue\u201d with management teams, it sounds more like a monologue at Debenhams. \u201cI will be smashing into them about why they don\u2019t do anything Sports Direct suggests,\u201d said Ashley on Thursday. A past investment in rival JD Sports was very profitable, it should be added. On the other hand, Goal Soccer Centres, where Sports Direct owns almost 19%, could be the next own-goal: the five-a-side football outfit issued a profits warning on Thursday that deflated its share price for a fifth. Meanwhile the 11% stake in the unlisted House of Fraser is illiquid and hard to value as control passes between two Chinese firms. Ashley owns almost two-thirds of Sports Direct, so outsiders know complaints will achieve little. Buying shares in other companies is \u201cin our DNA\u201d, says finance director John Kempster. Yes, that\u2019s the problem. Fox/Disney/Comcast/Sky thriller nears its final act The great Fox/Disney/Comcast/Sky thriller may be drawing to a close without a final twist. Comcast has withdrawn from the fight for 21 Century Fox, conceding, in effect, that the bidding had become too hot at $71bn (\u00a355bn). The bulk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire is thus destined for Disney, assuming US regulators approve. That still leaves the scrap for Sky, which is now Comcast\u2019s focus. The owner of NBC Universal is currently in the lead with its \u00a314.75-per-share cash offer, worth \u00a326bn, and the open question is whether Fox will return with a better bid. To judge by Sky\u2019s share price, just a whisker over \u00a315, the market has its doubts. If so, this saga will resolve with Comcast getting control of Sky and Disney taking Fox, either with or without the 39% stake in Sky. Investors in both bidders will be relieved. The sums of debt being sprayed around already look enormous.",

      "body": "<p>Orna Ni-Chionna, head of remuneration at Royal Mail, is \u201cvery disappointed\u201d that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/19/majority-of-investors-reject-pay-deal-for-royal-mails-chief-executive\">70% of voting shareholders think her pay report should be filed in the bin</a>, along with the junk mail. The company will reflect \u201cvery carefully\u201d on their views. Then it will consult with them, again \u201cvery closely\u201d. Then it won\u2019t change a thing.</p> <p>The last part wasn\u2019t spelled out, naturally, but it\u2019s how the plot usually works when the resolution in front of shareholders is purely advisory. Even when two-thirds of investors are unhappy, the board is free to do nothing. The system is silly.</p> <p>On Moya Greene\u2019s \u00a3914,000 payoff, it\u2019s probably true that Royal Mail\u2019s hands are tied. The outgoing chief executive negotiated a contract with an automatic parachute payment when she was hired in the pre-privatisation days of 2010 and the terms can\u2019t be undone without her say-so. Blame Sir Vince Cable, business secretary at the time, or a former underling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/19/majority-of-investors-reject-pay-deal-for-royal-mails-chief-executive\">Majority of investors reject pay deal for Royal Mail chief executive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Ni-Chionna\u2019s crew are directly in the firing line for the other issue that excited the rebels. New chief executive Rico Back\u2019s basic salary of \u00a3640,000 will be almost \u00a3100,000 more than Greene\u2019s. Ah, says the company, he\u2019ll get a smaller pension allowance so his overall \u201cfixed cash\u201d package is the same. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t really wash, however, because bonuses and share incentives are set as multiples of salary and those multiples have been left unaltered. Thus Back\u2019s maximum jackpot could be about \u00a3250,000 more than Greene\u2019s. There is no good explanation for the inflation.</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s slightly odd that Royal Mail\u2019s pay report, judged by the number of revolting shareholders, is deemed the worst ever from a FTSE 100 company. The salaries and potential bonuses are enormous by ordinary standards, of course, but you\u2019ll find far worse elsewhere. When Persimmon\u2019s absurd incentive scheme awarded \u00a3100m to chief executive Jeff Fairburn, the housebuilder still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/25/persimmon-investors-revolt-bonus-pay-vote\">scraped a 51% majority</a> \u2013 even though the chairman and pay chief had resigned in embarrassment for their role in the fiasco.</p> <p>Therein lies another absurdity of the advisory voting system. Fund managers often find it easier to object on points of principle than unleash fury when the worst examples of executive greed are staring them in the face. It makes no sense.</p> <h2>Sports Direct investments are mostly own-goals</h2> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s corporate reputation is greatly improved, according to a third-party survey, so please don\u2019t spoil Mike Ashley\u2019s delight by pointing out that it\u2019s easier to rise from the depths. Now, when are the next stock-picker-of-the-year awards? In that competition, a booby prize surely awaits.</p> <p>Sports Direct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/19/sports-direct-profits-nosedive-by-72\">has written down the value of its near-30% stake in Debenhams by \u00a385m</a>, reflecting the crash in the beleaguered department store chain\u2019s share price. The sum is equivalent to slightly more than half Sports Direct\u2019s underlying pretax profits last year.</p> <p>Why take these share punts? The official reasoning is that \u201cstrategic investments are in an integral part of the group\u2019s strategy\u201d, yet the grand total of Sports Direct\u2019s commercial relationship with Debenhams amounts to two store-in-store concessions (there used to be nine). As for the supposed \u201cactive dialogue\u201d with management teams, it sounds more like a monologue at Debenhams. \u201cI will be smashing into them about why they don\u2019t do anything Sports Direct suggests,\u201d said Ashley on Thursday.</p> <p>A past investment in rival JD Sports was very profitable, it should be added. On the other hand, Goal Soccer Centres, where Sports Direct owns almost 19%, could be the next own-goal: the five-a-side football outfit issued a profits warning on Thursday that deflated its share price for a fifth. Meanwhile the 11% stake in the unlisted House of Fraser is illiquid and hard to value as control passes between two Chinese firms.</p> <p>Ashley owns almost two-thirds of Sports Direct, so outsiders know complaints will achieve little. Buying shares in other companies is \u201cin our DNA\u201d, says finance director John Kempster. Yes, that\u2019s the problem.</p> <h2>Fox/Disney/Comcast/Sky thriller nears its final act</h2> <p>The great Fox/Disney/Comcast/Sky thriller may be drawing to a close without a final twist. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/19/comcast-turns-focus-sky-after-exiting-battle-21st-century-fox-rupert-murdoch\">Comcast has withdrawn from the fight for 21 Century Fox</a>, conceding, in effect, that the bidding had become too hot at $71bn (\u00a355bn). The bulk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire is thus destined for Disney, assuming US regulators approve.<br></p> <p>That still leaves the scrap for Sky, which is now Comcast\u2019s focus. The owner of NBC Universal is currently in the lead with its \u00a314.75-per-share cash offer, worth \u00a326bn, and the open question is whether Fox will return with a better bid. To judge by Sky\u2019s share price, just a whisker over \u00a315, the market has its doubts.</p> <p>If so, this saga will resolve with Comcast getting control of Sky and Disney taking Fox, either with or without the 39% stake in Sky. Investors in both bidders will be relieved. The sums of debt being sprayed around already look enormous.</p>",
