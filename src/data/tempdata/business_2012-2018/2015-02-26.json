      "bodyText": "The ABS\u2019s six-monthly compendium of gender indicators released this week reveals an Australia quite starkly divided along gender line. It\u2019s a nation where women are paid less for the work they do, do more unpaid work, are denied seats at the heads of the largest corporations, are more stressed and are greater victims of harassment. Looking at data on gender always has me rather wanting to avert my eyes. For a male over 40, who has been the beneficiary of the male patriarchy probably more than I care to admit, it\u2019s a tad disconcerting to be confronted with figures that confirm the position of privilege that is being a male in Australian society. As a father of two daughters it is also rather dispiriting to look at the slow pace with which society is changing on gender equality. But rather than get too depressed let\u2019s start with some positive news \u2013 women still live longer than men. When women get to 65, they can expect on average to live another 22 years; men get just 19 years: So clearly this must be due to a life lived free of stress and care? Well, certainly women do less paid work than men, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have their feet up. When combining paid and unpaid work together men do on average six hours and 25 mins a day work, while women marginally are ahead, with an average 7 hours and 33 minutes a week: This division of labour isn\u2019t too bad in the sense that a nice balance is achieved, but it highlights that men remain the ones who work the most for monetary gain \u2013 and thus intrinsically have the most independence. This is borne out by the data on median weekly earnings across occupations: In all occupations, the median male hourly rate is higher than it is for women, and this difference is magnified when applied to median weekly earnings \u2013 because men work more hours each week on average than women: And the difference between what women take home each week compared to men is not narrowing. Among the eight different occupation groups, only in three are the difference between earnings of men and women less in 2012 than it was in 2002: And as we discussed earlier in the week with the release of the Productivity Commission\u2019s report into childcare, the reasons why men work longer hours in paid employment is highlighted by why people of both genders are not looking for work (or more work). For men, the main reason is they are attending an education institution \u2013 school \u2013 TAFE, university etc. For women, the main reason is because they are caring for children: The reason stated by 28% of women for not working was due to caring for children \u2013 compared to just 3% of men. It\u2019s also worth noting that 12% of women not looking for work stated the main reason was due to the ill health of someone else or due to \u201cother family considerations\u201d, compared to just 5% of men. Still, I guess being at home more means women have more free time I guess? Alas, while 34.9% of men felt \u201crushed or pressed for time\u201d, 42.4% of women did. And once again the reason why each gender felt they were pressed for time was quite instructive. While the most common reason for both genders for being stressed was because of the rather ubiquitous \u201ctrying to balance work and family\u201d, the second most common reason for men was the \u201cpressure of work or study\u201d. For women, however, the second most common reason was \u201ctoo many demands\u201d closely followed by \u201cdemands of family\u201d. For men, the \u201cdemands of family\u201d rated only the sixth most common reason: Probably not helping with the stress is the fact that women are more than twice as more likely to experience sexual harassment as men do. In 2012 a fairly jaw-dropping 14.8% of women experienced sexual harassment at some point in the year, compared to 6.6% of men: By far the most common form of harassment was \u201cinappropriate comments\u201d. Nearly 10% of women had experienced such comments in 2012 \u2013 constituting 65% of all cases of sexual harassment towards women. And while men were on the receiving end of sexual harassment as well, interestingly such harassment was almost as likely to be have been perpetrated by a man as it was a woman. For women, nearly 95% of such cases involved a male perpetrator. Given such harassment also included indecent exposure, it clearly is not all workplace harassment, but it may not be a coincidence that women are on the end of more harassment when we look at the top echelons of companies executive structure and find them male dominated: In 2012, 96.5% of CEOs in the top 200 companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange were men. This was barely an improvement in gender equality from 2002 when 98.7% were men. Even at the lower level of executive managers, men still hold sway \u2013 almost like there is some power structure in place which ensured that the best man is always chosen for the job. In 2002, 91.6% of executive managers were men, by 2012 it had fallen all the way to 88.5%. At this rate, by around the turn of the century we\u2019ll get to a 50:50 split. It would seem on the road to equality, we still have a fair bit of driving to do.",

The central bank said a \u201croot-and-branch\u201d review of its market intelligence operations had found that some staff were unfamiliar with the way City firms operated. But Threadneedle Street was immediately warned by a prominent MP that a draconian approach to regulation of London\u2019s financial markets could chase business to New York or Frankfurt.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco is left with just one woman on its board of directors after non-executives Liv Garfield and Jacqueline Tammenoms Bakker announced plans to step down this weekend. Garfield said she wanted to focus fully on her new role as chief executive of Severn Trent, the water company, but Tammenoms Bakker, who has been on Tesco\u2019s board for six years, did not give a reason for her departure. The departures leave Tesco far short of the government target of 25% female board directors. Deanna Oppenheimer, the former Barclays executive, is the only woman now on the 11-strong board. There are no female executive directors, and just three of the 14 people on Tesco\u2019s executive committee, the level below the PLC board, are women. The exit of the two non-executives marks another step in the transformation of Tesco\u2019s board over the past year. The group has replaced its chairman, chief executive and finance director amid falling sales and profits and a \u00a3263m accounting scandal. A series of board directors exited under the tenure of former chief executive Philip Clarke, who at one point last year was the only full-time executive director at the head of the company. Clarke was the only person on the board with retail experience. Two new non-executives with any retail experience \u2013 Richard Cousins, the chief executive of food services firm Compass Group, and Mikael Ohlsson, the former chief executive of Ikea \u2013 both joined Tesco in November. The new chairman, John Allan, who was appointed last week and was previously chairman of electrical goods retailer Dixons, is expected to lead a further revamp of Tesco\u2019s board when he starts work on 1 March. Ken Hanna, the non-executive chairman of the audit committee when Tesco mis-stated income from suppliers, is thought likely to go. Replacements for Garfield and Tammenoms Bakker are expected to be in place by the supermarket\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in June but Tesco declined to say if the company would ensure more women were hired. \u201cWe are committed to a balanced, representative board and the composition of that board continues to evolve,\u201d he said. As Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive who took over from Clarke in September last year, has never had experience in running a retail firm before, Allan may also want to bring in a director with experience of grocery retailing. Allan himself once worked for Fine Fare, the defunct supermarket chain, but he left 30 years ago. Lewis is also making some changes to his team. Matt Davies, the well-regarded chief executive of bike and car parts chain Halfords, is set to join Tesco as head of its UK business in June while a string of executives were ousted after the discovery of the accounting errors. Lewis has also made a number of radical moves to shake up the group including the planned closure of 43 stores and ditching plans for 49 more new developments. But this week Lewis said he thought there was room for Tesco to increase its share of the grocery market above the near 30% it currently holds despite new competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. He has already simplified the group by selling off digital entertainment service Blinkbox and putting part of analytics company Dunnhumby on the market. But he told the Daily Mail this week that he has no plans to sell off Tesco\u2019s major retail businesses in South Korea and Thailand. He was less firm in his backing for the group\u2019s eastern European businesses which he said had \u201clong-term \u2026 underperformed, it\u2019s always promised more than it has delivered\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "PS: about that Bild stunt:... And finally, our Europe editor Ian Traynor has filed this analysis on Friday\u2019s vote, and beyond... The German parliament is expected to agree to extend the eurozone\u2019s bailout of Greece on Friday, capping a tumultuous first four weeks in office for the anti-austerity government in Athens. The next four months will be crueller yet. That will be clear from the debate in the Bundestag in Berlin. Although Chancellor Angela Merkel has never been outvoted in five years of policy decisions on the euro crisis and need not fear defeat on Friday, the endorsement will be grudging and will reek of suspicion of the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. At least 25 of Merkel\u2019s 311 MPs will oppose or abstain on the Greek rescue vote, in the largest act of dissent on Greece that Merkel has seen from her backbenchers. Patience with Greece is running out in Berlin. It is also turning to exasperation because of what is seen as the intemperate tone of Tsipras and his team. \u201cThere can be no reward for cheek,\u201d said the bestselling Bildzeitung tabloid on Thursday under a one-word banner headline of \u201cNein, no more billions for greedy Greeks.\u201d More here: That might be all for tonight. See you tomorrow for the vote! GW Greece\u2019s Ta Nea newspaper is reporting tonight that Greece could need a third bailout of some 30 billion euros, when its existing programme ends. It is attributed to eurozone sources, Helena flags up. The MNI newswire had the story earlier. See http://www.tanea.gr for more. This might come up in tomorrow\u2019s debate over the Greek bailout extension in the German parliament. Tax evasion is also a big theme in Greece today. Athens prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been addressing his radical left Syriza party\u2019s political secretariat in a meeting that cadres described as \u201cvery heavy.\u201d Helena Smith has the story: The young leader, clearly attempting to quash displeasure over last week\u2019s \u201cbridge agreement,\u201d said the government was poised for a \u201cdaily fight over the next four months.\u201d Tsipras vowed: \u201cWe will move quickly to apply swingeing reforms to clamp down on tax evasion and corruption and reforming the public administration, \u201c He added that the leftist-led coalition would also move to effect \u201cthe basic body\u201d of commitments made to the working class. Greece, he said, would also exploit \u201cthe country\u2019s geopolitical strength as part of the government\u2019s negotiating power.\u201d Successive Greek governments have made much of the country\u2019s location as the European Union\u2019s only Balkan state at the cross-roads of East and West (one increasingly used as a transit route by immigrants and refugees). Similar emphasis has been placed on Greece\u2019s role as a NATO member in an increasingly dangerous neighbourhood. Doubts expressed over the agreement by John Milios, Syriza\u2019s chief economist and the man in charge of the party\u2019s economic policies, had cast a shadow over the meeting with MPs meeting, cadres said. Milios spoke of a \u201cbig climbdown\u201d in his blog today - prompting minister of state Alekos Flampourari to say he didn\u2019t think it was opportune for such statements to be made \u201cby someone who is still responsible for the economic policy of the party.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of questions, a lot of unclear things about the agreement,\u201d a Syriza MP has just told me asking that he not be named \u201clest my comments be misunderstood.\u201d \u201cWe are coming round to accepting that the agreement was the best we could do but it still hurts.\u201d The BBC has more details about the proposed sale of Coutts\u2019 international arm: Last year RBS appointed Goldman Sachs to find a buyer for Coutts\u2019 international operations, as part of its drive to focus on the UK business. Coutts International employs 1,200 people, has some \u00a321.5bn of assets under management and has an estimated value of up \u00a3800m . A buyer would have to find a new name for the international operation as RBS intends to keep the Coutts brand for the UK business. Tax barrister Jolyon Maugham QC, who has worked on several important tax cases recently, tweets that other banks may face similar investigations: You can see our news story about the German probe into Coutts here: Coutts\u2019 Swiss operation faces German investigation over tax evasion claims The US investigation into possible tax evasion have already hit RBS\u2019s efforts to sell Coutts International, according to the Financial Times. The FT reported last week that: Bidders for Coutts International have tried to use the recent scandal over tax evasion by clients of HSBC\u2019s Swiss arm to lower the price of the private banking assets being sold by Royal Bank of Scotland, said people familiar with the situation. This new investigation by German authorities may not make the sale any easier. Although the FT does point out that RBS has been pro-actively addressing the issue: Bidders for Coutts International have been given a detailed breakdown of the bank\u2019s client portfolio in an attempt to reassure them that it does not include any potential problem cases of either tax-dodging or money-laundering. My colleague Juliette Garside flags up the help that Coutts offers its clients: Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS discussed the tax evasion probe into Coutts\u2019 Swiss arm by German authorities at a press conference in London. Our City editor Jill Treanor was there, and reports: McEwan explained the Coutts International business was being sold because it did not make money and that private banks had taken too long to clean up their activities. McEwan said. \u201cI want to be very clear if we find anything that has evidence of wrong doing we will come down incredibly hard on any of those issues.\u201d \u201dAny situation like this we take seriously\u2026 it if the reputation of our business. This is what has tarnished the banking industry and in my view private banks have taken far too long to catch up with the public\u2019s expectations.\u201d Coutts was founded in the late 17th century, and acquired Zurich-based Bank von Ernst &amp; Cie in 2003. As covered earlier, McEwan has also waived a \u00a31m \u2018allowance\u2019, on top of his basic salary, after reporting that RBS posted a \u00a33.5bn loss this morning. McEwan, who is a New Zealander, has also explains that he is non-domiciled for tax purposes, and doesn\u2019t have a Swiss account himself. Yesterday, MPs on the Treasury committee grilled HSBC chief Stuart Gulliver over his decision to use a Swiss account through a company based in Panama. Back to the news that Coutts bank is being investigated by German authorities over whether its Swiss banking arm helped customers evade tax. RBS discloses the probe on page 120 of its 2014 financial results, released this morning. It says: German prosecutor investigation into Coutts &amp; Co Ltd A prosecuting authority in Germany is undertaking an investigation into Coutts &amp; Co Ltd in Switzerland, and current and former employees, for alleged aiding and abetting of tax evasion by certain Coutts &amp; Co Ltd clients. Coutts &amp; Co Ltd is cooperating with the authority. Coutts has also been investigated by the US Department of Justice, over \u201cthe possibility that some of its clients may not have declared their assets in compliance with US tax laws.\u201d It presented the results of its own investigation to the DoJ last summer, and expects to reach \u201ca resolution\u201d during 2015. Back in Greece, the Syriza party is putting on a brave face after yesterday\u2019s marathon, record-breaking 12-hour session to discuss the bailout situation, writes Helena Smith in Athens. A phalanx of Syriza cadres appearing on TV chat shows this morning said the deal was essentially \u201cnot an agreement\u201d but the key that would unlock the door to new negotiations. Syriza MEP Kostas Chrysogonos declared: \u201cThe next four months are what is critical....There is no agreement as such.\u201d Christos Mantas, who is secretary of Syriza\u2019s parliamentary group, said \u201cevery MP had the chance to speak\u201d at yesterday\u2019s marathon session. He told Star TV that: \u201cWe have taken a small step that is only the beginning. Things will be judged on how we govern....Next week you will see that parliament will begin operating and a lot of legislation will be pushed through,\u201d Mantas added that the bills would include protective measures for austerity-hit Greeks, concluding. \u201cWhy is (German finance minister Wolfgang) Schauble so angry, if we are such good guys?\u201d Royal Bank of Scotland has revealed that Coutts, its private banking arm, is being investigated by German authorities. They are examining whether it helped clients to evade tax by using Swiss bank accounts \u2013 a hot topic, following revelations around HSBC in recent weeks. Coutts, one of the world\u2019s oldest banks, is famous for handling the Queen\u2019s financial affairs. RBS CEO Ross McEwan has been questioned about the probe, and pledged to take \u201csevere action\u201d if wrongdoing is discovered. ITV News business editor Joel Hills has tweeted the key points: Hmmm. The \u20ac700m that flowed back into Greek banks on Tuesday may be related to pension payments by the government, reckons Kathimerini newspaper -- More here. So, maybe the tide hasn\u2019t turned quite as much as Varoufakis suggested. Still, a senior banker has told Reuters that another \u20ac150m came in on Wednesday. The German Association of Journalists has called on Bild to ditch its anti-Greek campaign. They argue that Bild has crossed the line into political campaigning, by urging readers to pose with their \u201cNein\u201d poster ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Bundestag vote [see earlier post]. They added that it is ethically questionable to vilify a whole nation for the fiscal mistakes of their politicians. The governor of Greece\u2019s central bank has predicted that the country\u2019s economy will grow this year, unless the fragile recovery is derailed by bailout deadlock. Yannis Stournaras (the former finance minister) told an audience in Athens that it was vital that Greece reaches a final agreement with its creditors to cover future funding needs. Delivering his annual report, Stournaras urged the government to pursue talks with its creditors in a spirit of co-operation. There is no room for complacency, he added, given the strain that Greek banks have come under and the fragility of the recovery. But the worst could be over, Stournaras said: \u201cIn the past few years, we have covered some very rough ground at high cost to the whole of Greek society. \u201cIf we can address the relatively few issues still pending and complete the first phase of the effort launched in 2010, we will then be able to move on to the next phase, in which the growth potential of the economy will be considerably enhanced.\u201d (I\u2019ve taken the quotes via AFP) Reuters snapped other key points: GREEK CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR SAYS REACHING NEW DEAL WITH PARTNERS MAY BE NECESSARY FOR RECOVERY TO TAKE ROOT BUT GROWTH PLAN ALSO NEEDED GREEK CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR SAYS GREEK BANKS ARE WELL-CAPITALISED BUT LIQUIDITY HAS COME UNDER CONSIDERABLE STRAIN IN RECENT MONTHS GREEK CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR SAYS GREEK BANKING SYSTEM FACES SERIOUS CHALLENGES DUE TO HIGH LEVEL OF BAD LOANS GREEK CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR URGES GOVT TO COMPLETE STRUCTURAL REFORMS, REVIEW TAX POLICY, COMPLETE MAJOR PRIVATISATIONS Yanis Varoufakis also attended the annual meeting: Bild\u2019s campaign against those \u201cGreedy Greeks\u201d may be backfiring. This reader has posed for a selfie, as instructed, but he\u2019s refusing to pay for that \u2018stupid\u2019 newspaper: German news magazine Spiegel confirms that CDU/CSU MPs expressed concern about the Greek loan deal, at their meeting with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble this morning. It also reports that CDU parliamentary leader Volker Kauder criticised the \u201cloutish\u201d comments made by Greek politicians -- it\u2019s not clear exactly what he\u2019s referring to. More here. As mentioned earlier, 22 conservative MPs indicated they\u2019d oppose extending Greece\u2019s bailout, in a test ballot at the meeting. Europe\u2019s economy may be turning the corner. Consumer confidence has hit a seven year high this month, Eurostat just announced, with people in several eurozone nations reporting that they\u2019re a little more optimistic: And the M3 measure of money supply has also risen, suggesting economic activity picking up: With Germany\u2019s unemployment total falling again this morning, there are some encouraging signs that growth may be picking up. Greek banks suffered a significant deposit flight last month, new data from the European Central Bank shows. Around \u20ac12bn was withdrawn from Greek banks in January, the ECB says, taking deposits down to \u20ac155.4bn. That\u2019s close to, or possibly even below, the levels plumbed in 2012. Analysts believe the withdrawals continued this month, as Athens clashed with its creditors over a bailout extension. But the situation may be changing. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has declared that \u20ac700m flowed back into Greek banks on Tuesday. He told Bloomberg TV that savers took confidence from the deal agreed last Friday, and signed off by Greece\u2019s lenders on Tuesday \u201cThere was a deposit flight back into the Greek banking sector,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a question of direction. Once you turn the tide, you hope.\u201d More here: Greek bank deposits return after bailout extension On a happier note, the ONS also reports that UK exports rose by 3.5% in the last quarter of 2014. That reverses a 0.8% drop in the third quarter. Imports increased by 1.3%, meaning the UK\u2019s dire trade position improved for once. But it\u2019s still quite bad: There\u2019s a worrying new fact in today\u2019s UK GDP data; British business investment has fallen at its fastest pace in almost six years. Business investment dropped by 1.4% in the last three months of 2014, following a 1.2% decline in July-September. It was driven by a drop in spending in the energy sector, probably in response to falling oil and gas prices. The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the last three months of 2014, the Office for National Statistics reports. That matches the initial estimate. Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s take on Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s results: Royal Bank of Scotland has revealed it handed out \u00a3421m in bonuses in 2014 as it reported its seventh consecutive year of losses and appointed Sir Howard Davies as its new chairman. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, also warned of substantial job cuts as a result of a further retrenchment of its once-dominant investment bank. RBS said it would reduce its operations to 13 countries, compared with 38 at the end of last year and 51 in 2009, just after it was bailed out. Announcing another overhaul of the investment bank, McEwan said: \u201cThis marks the end of a standalone investment bank at RBS.\u201d The move is intended to focus the bank on the UK. Davies, chairman of the airports commission and a former City regulator, is replacing Sir Philip Hampton as chairman at the 79%-taxpayer owned bank. He will join the board in June before taking over the top job in September.... Full story: RBS paid out \u00a3421m in bonuses in 2014 despite \u00a33.5bn loss Just in: Another strong month of unemployment data from Germany, backing hopes that Europe\u2019s largest economy is picking up. The unemployment total fell by 20,000 this month, on a seasonally-adjusted basis, twice as much as expected. That leaves the unemployment rate at a record low of 6.5%. Some City bankers are too buttoned up. But not Bill Winters, the new boss of Standard Chartered! As this video shows, he doesn\u2019t mind loosening a few buttons for charity, and can pull off a decent falsetto at the same time. Full story on the Wall Street Journal: Ever Wanted to See Bankers Strip? There are fresh signs of jitters in Germany over Greece\u2019s bailout today. Reuters is reporting that finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told CDU party members that the extension could be abandoned if Athens doesn\u2019t stick to its pledges. Here\u2019s the story: Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schaeuble told a meeting of conservatives lawmakers on Thursday that recent remarks by the Greek finance minister had strained European solidarity and that a bailout extension for Athens could be ditched if the country failed to stick to its promises, according to participants. The German finance minister met lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc to prepare for Friday\u2019s vote in the Bundestag on extending the Greek bailout in return for a new package of reform commitments by the new leftist-led government of Alexis Tsipras. Lawmakers speaking on condition of anonymity said Schaeuble said Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis \u201cstrains the solidarity of European partners\u201d in interviews where he has resurrected talk of a debt haircut for Greece and cast doubt on its ability to repay its international debts. The Bild tabloid has also weighed in, encouraging readers to send a photo of themselves posing with a page saying \u2018NO!\u2019 to giving \u2018Greedy Greeks\u2019 more cash. Could someone kindly remind Bild where most of Greece\u2019s bailout money has gone? It\u2019s official: Standard Chartered CEO Peter Sands is leaving the company, replaced by Bill Winters. And he\u2019s not alone -- the bank has also announced that chairman John Peace will depart in 2016. Jaspal Bindra, CEO for Asia, is also leaving soon, along with three other long-serving non-executives. Here\u2019s the statement. Newsflash from Germany: 22 MPs from Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party and their CSU allies* are planning to oppose Greece\u2019s four-month bailout extension in Friday\u2019s vote. [* - tweaked, thanks readers] That\u2019s not enough of a rebellion to stop the legislation passing, as Merkel\u2019s coalition has a chunky majority. In other banking news, Sky are reporting that Standard Chartered is about to name a new chief executive: If so, Peter Sands\u2019 increasingly precarious grip on the CEO\u2019s chair has finally been broken, after months of shareholders pressure over its falling profits. Shares in Standard Chartered are up 3.6% in early trading, followed by RBS - up 2%. RBS CEO Ross McEwan has announced there will be \u201csubstantial\u201d job cuts as he continues to reshape the company. Its investment bank is being particularly hit. McEwan just held a conference call with reporters; Jill is tweeting the key points: RBS is also planning to \u201cfully exit\u201d its markets businesses in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and substantially cut its presence in Asia Pacific and the US. Chancellor George Osborne has flexed his muscles and decreed that RBS\u2019s top directors should not take home a bonus this year. In a letter to the bank, Osborne says: I would expect that no executive directors or members of the executive committee will receive bonuses.\u201d Britain\u2019s government still owns 79% of RBS, having pumped tens of billions of pounds into the bank to rescue in the financial crisis. RBS incurred almost \u00a32.2bn in fines, provisions and legal costs last year, for its role in a series of banking scandals and blunders. The bank explains: This included additional provisions for PPI redress (\u00a3650 million) in PBB, provisions relating to investigations into the foreign exchange market (\u00a3720 million) in CIB, Interest Rate Hedging Product redress (\u00a3185 million), the fine relating to the 2012 IT incident (\u00a359 million) booked in Centre and other costs (\u00a3580 million) including provisions relating to packaged accounts and investment products. That\u2019s actually an improvement on 2013, when litigation and conduct costs hit \u00a33.8bn. RBS has also confirmed that its CEO, Ross McEwan, will not take a \u00a31m \u2018pay allowance\u2019 [designed to avoid the EU\u2019s bonus cap] which he was entitled to 2014, as reported last night. RBS also has a new chairman, Sir Howard Davies (former head of the CBI, the Financial Services Authority, the London School of Economics...) 2014 wasn\u2019t a vintage year for RBS\u2019s investment bankers: Another year, another loss at Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS has just reported that it made an attributable loss of \u00a33.5bn in the last financial year. That\u2019s mainly due to writing down the value of its US business, Citizens, by \u00a34bn and a tax charge. That\u2019s an improvement on last year, when the bank lost around \u00a39bn. But the turnaround job at RBS, bailed out by the taxpayer six years ago, continues. This is the seventh loss in a row. RBS\u2019s bonus pool has shrunk too; bankers will share \u00a3421m this year, down from \u00a3536m a year ago. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of Greece, the world economy, the financial markets and business. Today we\u2019ll be tracking the political tensions in Athens over its bailout agreement, as analysts fret about Greece\u2019s ability to meet its debt repayments in the coming months. Yesterday, Syriza MPs talked for hours behind closed doors, amid mounting angst over the government\u2019s privatisation plans. Energy minister Panayiotis Lafazanis is emerging as the leading voice of dissent over the decision to compromise with Greece\u2019s lenders, declaring: \u201cThere are parts of the letter [with reform proposals] that are reminiscent of the lenders\u2019 language, not ours.\u201d We also the latest German unemployment data (9am GMT), the second estimate of UK growth in the last quarter (9.30am), and a new measure of eurozone consumer confidence (at 10am).

(the former finance minister) told an audience in Athens that it was vital that Greece reaches a final agreement with its creditors to cover future funding needs.</p> <p>Delivering his annual report, Stournaras urged the government to pursue talks with its creditors in a spirit of co-operation. </p> <p>There is no room for complacency, he added, given the strain that Greek banks have come under and the fragility of the recovery.</p> <p>But the worst could be over, Stournaras said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIn the past few years, we have covered some very rough ground at high cost to the whole of Greek society. </p> <p>\u201cIf we can address the relatively few issues still pending and complete the first phase of the effort launched in 2010, we will then be able to move on to the next phase, in which the growth potential of the economy will be considerably enhanced.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>(<em>I\u2019ve taken the quotes via AFP</em>)</p> <p>Reuters snapped other

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The German parliament is expected to agree to extend the eurozone\u2019s bailout of Greece on Friday, capping a tumultuous first four weeks in office for the anti-austerity government in Athens. The next four months will be crueller yet. That will be clear from the debate in the Bundestag in Berlin. Although Chancellor Angela Merkel has never been outvoted in five years of policy decisions on the euro crisis and need not fear defeat on Friday, the endorsement will be grudging and will reek of suspicion of the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. At least 25 of Merkel\u2019s 311 MPs will oppose or abstain on the Greek rescue vote, in the largest act of dissent on Greece that Merkel has seen from her backbenchers. Patience with Greece is running out in Berlin. It is also turning to exasperation because of what is seen as the intemperate tone of Tsipras and his team. \u201cThere can be no reward for cheek,\u201d said the bestselling Bildzeitung tabloid on Thursday under a one-word banner headline of \u201cNein, no more billions for greedy Greeks.\u201d Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the finance minister, told Merkel\u2019s backbenchers that the new Greek government was manipulating eurozone largesse to \u201ctrample all over European solidarity\u201d, Der Spiegel reported. The Germans expect the Greeks, beneficiaries of a \u20ac240bn (\u00a3175bn) rescue, to be grateful. Instead they are seen to be impertinent. No sooner was the ink dry on the deal on Tuesday granting Athens a 17-week loan extension than its finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, upped the ante and demanded the massive debt burden be partly written off. Sch\u00e4uble virtually accused the Tsipras team of lying. \u201cThe question now is whether one can believe the Greek government\u2019s assurances or not. There\u2019s a lot of doubt in Germany.\u201d The word in Brussels is that Sch\u00e4uble and Varoufakis can hardly bear to be in the same room together. The confrontation looks certain to get worse over the next month as Tsipras sets out the fiscal and economic reforms he must enact to win the bailout extension and then, over the summer, a new package of financial aid. That things have turned so sour so quickly is less than surprising. The big centrist governments of the eurozone were never likely to do any favours for a new hard-left Syriza movement dedicated to unpicking five years of German-led response to the crisis \u2013 fiscal consolidation or austerity. Why would they help Tsipras, seen by the mainstream as a dangerous demagogue? Besides, helping him would encourage others to follow suit and would mean admitting they got their reaction to the euro crisis wrong. Whether the policies are working or not \u2013 and in Greece there are minimal signs of success \u2013 is beside the point. In the fight between Greece and its creditors, it is less about right than it is about might. Can Tsipras stare down the combined forces of Germany and Spain, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund? Is he picking a fight he cannot win, just as two of his predecessors gambled recklessly and lost? The precedents are not encouraging. At the height of the Greek crisis in late 2011 and early 2012, George Papandreou, the centre-left prime minister, stunned Merkel and other eurozone leaders by announcing, without telling them first, that he was calling a national referendum on the outcome of his talks with the eurozone. Europe\u2019s leaders had spent weeks wrangling over the deal only to see it all possibly unravelling. Merkel and France\u2019s Nicolas Sarkozy read Papandreou the riot act. If there was to be a plebiscite, Merkel insisted, the sole question would be whether Greece wants to stay in the single currency or not. That scenario would be repeated should Tsipras be boxed into a corner and decide to call a referendum. Papandreou had to back down. There was no referendum. Within a week he was out of office. A parallel fate awaited his centre-right successor, Antonis Samaras. The Germans and the eurozone insist that the four-month bailout extension means that Tsipras has to meet Greece\u2019s obligations under the rescue pact, terms that Tsipras was elected to scrap. As long ago as last June, Samaras essentially stopped delivering on the bailout terms and refused to negotiate with the reviled troika of officials from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF. He resisted extending the bailout which was due to end in December, prolonging it in the end by a mere two months. He then engineered an early presidential election in Greece, but failed to get his nominee the job, triggering early parliamentary elections. As with Papandreou, Samaras\u2019 gamble backfired disastrously. He, too, lost the prime ministership. Both men sought to challenge the eurozone and the Germans. They went down in a hail of hubris. Eurozone leaders detect similar mistakes by the Tsipras team already. On his first visit to Berlin to see Sch\u00e4uble, Varoufakis suddenly started talking about the Nazis. That was unusual. At his first EU summit, Tsipras declared to the Brussels press corps that the troika and the bailout were dead, precisely the opposite of what the same journalists were being told by the other participants. Two completely opposed narratives \u2013 the one being aired in the Bundestag on Friday, the other being peddled daily in Athens \u2013 are in circulation thanks to the wordcraft of the drafters of last Friday\u2019s deal extending the bailout. Toxic terms such as \u201ctroika\u201d and \u201cbailout\u201d have been banished, replaced by \u201cthe European institutions\u201d and the \u201ccurrent arrangements\u201d. This enables Tsipras to claim at home he has won a famous victory. And it allows Sch\u00e4uble to argue that only the form has changed, but not the substance. The change in wording matters, but probably not as much as Tsipras and Varoufakis claim. The biggest concession Tsipras won was the power to draw up his own economic reform agenda over the weekend, where Papandreou and Samaras were presented with detailed troika diktats. But under whatever name, the troika retains the authority to approve or reject the Greek proposals or demand changes. And in return for that concession, Tsipras has had to row back on many of his election pledges, a process likely to intensify in the months ahead. In seeking a loan extension, the Tsipras government has said that a planned rise in minimum wages would be delayed, there would be a clampdown on early retirement and completed privatisations would not be reversed. There is much emphasis from the new government on battling corruption, tax evasion, and soaking the rich. But on Wednesday Varoufakis pointed to the difficulty of targeting Greece\u2019s voracious oligarchs. The country\u2019s shipping magnates, for example, were \u201cvery mobile\u201d, Varoufakis told Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that their money will leave the country if they should be taxed.\u201d In a lengthy interview on a Greek radio station on Wednesday, Varoufakis bragged of serial victories over the Germans and eurozone finance ministers and of how the Tsipras tactics had split the Europeans. \u201cDiscussion over debt restructuring will have to begin very swiftly,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou know, they [eurozone] have asked me to stop talking about cancellation of the debt, but talk instead of its restructuring. Restructuring of the debt is exactly that \u2013 a debt reduction.I am not talking about prolongation. I am talking about swaps of the debt that will effectively decrease it to a very big extent. \u201cThe fact that we no longer have this unified group against Greece, where the discussion about the debt was prohibited, and we now have a side that has broken down in many different sides \u2013 some of which are very open to our proposals \u2013 this by itself is a great success.\u201d In Berlin, this smacks of hubris.",

The confrontation looks certain to get worse over the next month as Tsipras sets out the fiscal and economic reforms he must enact to win the bailout extension and then, over the summer, a new package of financial aid.</p> <p>That things have turned so sour so quickly is less than surprising. The big centrist governments of the eurozone were never likely to do any favours for a new hard-left Syriza movement dedicated to unpicking five years of German-led response to the crisis \u2013 fiscal consolidation or austerity. Why would they help Tsipras, seen by the mainstream as a dangerous demagogue? Besides, helping him would encourage others to follow suit and would mean admitting they got their reaction to the euro crisis wrong.</p> <p>Whether the policies are working or not \u2013 and in Greece there are minimal signs of success \u2013 is beside the point. In the fight between Greece and its creditors, it is less about right than it is about might.</p> <p>Can Tsipras stare down the combined forces of Germany and Spain, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund?

    "webTitle": "Regime change at Standard Chartered but wait for Winters' verdict", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered chairman Sir John Peace called it a boardroom \u201crefresh\u201d, as if he was administering a light rub with a damp towel. But this is a full immersion with deep scrub. Chief executive Peter Sands is going, to be replaced by perennial big-job contender Bill Winters, a former JPMorgan deputy. Asia boss Jaspal Bindra is also out. Peace himself will depart next year, following three long-serving non-executives. In the slow world of Asian banking, where stable relationships matter (or so Standard always tells us), this is a regime change. Most shareholders will say it\u2019s overdue. After three profit warnings, Aberdeen Asset Management and the Singaporeans at Temasek \u2013 the two big investors \u2013 applauded Winters\u2019 appointment quickly, almost with relief. Sands deserved a portion of Peace\u2019s lavish praise. His first six years in the job brought only success, even as western banks crumbled. But the past two years have been horrible. There was the badly handled run-in with US regulators for busting sanctions against Iran. Sands is also accused of being slow to smell the slowdown in Asia, and then being timid in his cost-cutting. Standard\u2019s profits have doubled during his reign but there\u2019s a reason why the share price is lower than it was eight years ago: Standard\u2019s capital buffers may need reinforcement. In theory, the problem isn\u2019t serious: 10.7% on the core tier-one measure is within official guidelines. In practice, the market worries that an overexposure to Asian property developers and miners can only lead to a rise in bad debts. Winters lacks experience in Asia and retail banking, but so what? An outsider\u2019s eyes are required. He is regulator-friendly, too, so not the type to sound off about banks being treated \u201clike criminals\u201d (Bindra) or to try to airbrush a corporate admission of \u201cpast knowing and wilful criminal conduct\u201d as a \u201cclerical error\u201d (Peace). Winters is an investment banker, so knows the game on raising cash from shareholders: if you think you need a rights issue, go early. His arrival sparked a 5% rise in the shares. That looks premature: the presumed hero hasn\u2019t delivered his verdict on capital yet. Cleaning up RBS \u201cWe should stop kidding ourselves that we\u2019re going to be all things to all people,\u201d said Ross McEwan as he reached for a bigger axe to apply to Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s investment bank. Job losses among the 16,000 staff will be \u201csubstantial\u201d, said the chief executive. Post-crisis RBS has always had a love-hate relationship with its investment bank. For a couple of years, when returns were good, the unit\u2019s profits came in handy, despite the annual bonus angst. But investment banks require vast sums of capital to operate and being a bit-part player is pointless in today\u2019s climate.

      "body": "<p>Standard Chartered chairman Sir John Peace called it a boardroom \u201crefresh\u201d, as if he was administering a light rub with a damp towel. But this is a full immersion with deep scrub. Chief executive Peter Sands is going, to be replaced by perennial big-job contender Bill Winters, a former JPMorgan deputy. Asia boss Jaspal Bindra is also out. Peace himself will depart next year, following three long-serving non-executives.</p> <p>In the slow world of Asian banking, where stable relationships matter (or so Standard always tells us), this is a regime change. Most shareholders will say it\u2019s overdue. After three profit warnings, Aberdeen Asset Management and the Singaporeans at Temasek \u2013 the two big investors \u2013 applauded Winters\u2019 appointment quickly, almost with relief.</p> <p>Sands deserved a portion of Peace\u2019s lavish praise. His first six years in the job brought only success, even as western banks crumbled. But the past two years have been horrible.</p> <p>There was the badly handled run-in with US regulators for busting sanctions against Iran. Sands is also accused of being slow to smell the slowdown in Asia, and then being timid in his cost-cutting. Standard\u2019s profits have doubled during his reign but there\u2019s a reason why the share price is lower than it was eight years ago: Standard\u2019s capital buffers may need reinforcement.</p> <p>In theory, the problem isn\u2019t serious: 10.7% on the core tier-one measure is within official guidelines. In practice, the market worries that an overexposure to Asian property developers and miners can only lead to a rise in bad debts.</p> <p>Winters lacks experience in Asia and retail banking, but so what? An outsider\u2019s eyes are required. He is regulator-friendly, too, so not the type to sound off about banks being treated \u201clike criminals\u201d (Bindra) or to try to airbrush a corporate admission of \u201cpast knowing and wilful criminal conduct\u201d as a \u201cclerical error\u201d (Peace).</p> <p>Winters is an investment banker, so knows the game on raising cash from shareholders: if you think you need a rights issue, go early. His arrival sparked a 5% rise in the shares. That looks premature: the presumed hero hasn\u2019t delivered his verdict on capital yet.</p> <h2>Cleaning up RBS</h2> <p>\u201cWe should stop kidding ourselves that we\u2019re going to be all things to all people,\u201d said Ross McEwan as he reached for a bigger axe to apply to Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s investment bank. Job losses among the 16,000 staff will be \u201csubstantial\u201d, said the chief executive.</p> <p>Post-crisis RBS has always had a love-hate relationship with its investment bank. For a couple of years, when returns were good, the unit\u2019s profits came in handy, despite the annual bonus angst. But investment banks require vast sums of capital to operate and being a bit-part player is pointless in today\u2019s climate. Getting smaller would be the right thing to do even if Chancellor George Osborne wasn\u2019t commanding such a strategy.</p> <p>But we should also stop kidding ourselves that RBS can be returned to private ownership soon. McEwan is correct in boasting that \u201cunderneath the conduct, litigation and restructuring charges\u201d there lurks a bank that is operating better.

    "webTitle": "Coutts' Swiss operation faces tax evasion claims", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The venerable Coutts bank, home of the Queen\u2019s personal accounts, has been drawn into the mounting controversy about private banking with an admission that its Swiss arm is under investigation for aiding and abetting tax evasion. Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns the 300-year-old Coutts, admitted on Thursday that German prosecutors are investigating current and former employees of the private bank\u2019s Zurich and Geneva offices. The bank looks after \u00a320bn belonging to 32,000 international customers including sovereigns, celebrities and multimillionaire entrepreneurs. Each must show they have at least \u00a31m in free cash to open an account \u2013 and even then they may not be allowed in. Details of the Coutts investigation follow the leak of details of 100,000 accounts at HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking business. That leak, which showed how HSBC clients might evade tax by moving their wealth around in \u201cbricks\u201d of cash and how the bank provided advice on tax avoidance, has lifted the lid on the usually secretive world of Swiss banking. The chancellor, George Osborne, has now promised to include in next month\u2019s budget a new law to target those who aid or abet tax evasion. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, admitted Coutts was facing an investigation by Germany and said private banks had been too slow to clean up their businesses following the 2008 crisis. He said: \u201cAny situation like this we take seriously \u2026 it is the reputation of our business. This is what has tarnished the banking industry and in my view private banks have taken far too long to catch up with the public\u2019s expectations.\u201d The disclosure of the investigation raises the prospect of an institution bailed out by UK taxpayers in 2008 facing penalties for helping its clients deprive other countries of tax revenue. Coutts was founded in 1692 and still operates under the logo of the three gold crowns which the Scot John Campbell used as the bank\u2019s sign when he set up business on the Strand in London. It has been owned by RBS for 15 years. An account carries cachet and is a symbol of wealth. Customers are promised \u201cthe provision of exceptional wealth advice\u201d. Coutts\u2019 Swiss operation is already one of more than 100 banks which are being investigated by US authorities over possible tax avoidance and RBS said the German authorities had been involved more recently. McEwan had put the international operations of Coutts up for sale before the German investigation was revealed and on Thursday the Coutts chief executive, Rory Tapner, departed suddenly. The bank said his exit was part of a wider management overhaul. McEwan said the business had been put on the market because it didn\u2019t make money and he told ITV there were moral as well as business reasons for doing so. \u201cI want to be very clear if we find anything that has evidence of wrongdoing we will come down incredibly hard on any of those issues,\u201d he said. RBS intends to keep Coutts\u2019 UK business, which is steeped in history. Ledgers kept in the bank\u2019s Strand boardroom contain signatures from famous past clients, including Charles Dickens and Bram Stoker, author of Dracula. But the bank has not escaped all controversy. After the financial crisis the founder of the Nectar loyalty card scheme, Sir Keith Mills, started a campaign against Coutts after he put his money in savings bonds issued by AIG, the troubled US insurer. Coutts denied it mis-sold the bonds. Last year the bank admitted that thousands of its well-heeled customers may have been given unsuitable investment advice and it was reviewing files going back as far as 1957. The Geneva operations have only existed since 1987 but are now adding to the litany of conduct issues facing RBS, which is still 81% owned by the taxpayer. It has already been fined for rigging interest rate and currency markets and faces nearly \u00a32bn of penalties for the way it sold mortgage bonds in the runup to the 2008 banking crisis. The disclosure of the German investigation came deep in the pages of legal warnings attached to RBS\u2019s annual financial results which showed the bank lost\u00a33.5bn last year. It was the bank\u2019s seventh consecutive year of losses, which now total \u00a349bn since the financial crisis, when the government used \u00a345bn of taxpayers\u2019 cash to stop the Edinburgh-based bank collapsing in 2008. Following the Guardian\u2019s revelation that Stuart Gulliver, the boss of HSBC, has his own Swiss bank account which is routed through Panama, McEwan also faced questions about his banking arrangements. McEwan said: \u201cI\u2019m a proud Kiwi but I work here and I pay taxes here.\u201d He said he had accounts in New Zealand, Australia and the UK, but did not have a Swiss account.",

The 53-year-old American shot to prominence a decade ago as co-head of investment banking at the Wall Street giant, based in London. A star banker, he had been tipped as a possible successor to JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon, but departed after falling out with him. Winters was said to have alerted the bank early on about the risks it was taking, which led to it racking up losses of $6bn in 2012. Popular with his colleagues, he also showed public humility at a time when other investment bankers were in denial. Shortly before he was fired, he said some bankers had been greedy and inept. Winters joined JPMorgan as a trainee in New York in 1983 and worked his way up, moving to London in 1992 as head of European fixed income. In 2004 he was promoted to co-head of investment banking. He steered the division through the 2008 financial crisis and was closely involved in the acquisition and integration of collapsed rival Bear Stearns. After leaving JPMorgan, Winters set up investment firm Renshaw Bay in London, and has been advising insurance entrepreneur Clive Cowdery\u2019s Resolution vehicle on buying up asset-management businesses. As one of five members of the independent commission on banking, Winters has also been also one of the architects of UK banking reform. The commission was set up in the early days of the coalition government and submitted its report to the chancellor in September 2011. Its recommendation that firms should separate their high street banking operations from the trading floor is being implemented. Winters has been linked with a series of high-profile jobs over the years, including the chief executive of Barclays after Bob Diamond left, as well as the top job at UBS. Now he has finally landed one \u2013 but he has his work cut out at the scandal-ridden emerging markets bank.",

      "bodyText": "Investment spending by UK businesses fell at the fastest rate in almost six years at the end of 2014 as energy companies responded to falling global oil prices. Business investment dropped by 1.4% in the fourth quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics. The decrease was mainly driven by oil and gas companies reining in North Sea spending. It was the biggest quarterly fall since the financial crisis in the second quarter of 2009. The ONS published the number as part of its second estimate of GDP between October and December, which details how the UK economy performed. Growth was confirmed at 0.5%, a slight slowdown compared with the 0.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2014. Growth in 2014 overall was unchanged at 2.6%, the fastest rate of annual expansion since 2007 and the strongest among the G7 economies . The Treasury said: \u201cIt is clear that the foundations for a sustainable recovery are being laid.\u201d Despite the fall in business investment in the fourth quarter, investment rose by 6.8% in 2014 overall, the strongest annual rise since 2007. In a further pre-election boost for the government, net trade made a positive contribution to growth in the fourth quarter, after export growth of 3.5% outpaced a smaller 1.3% rise in imports. \u201cThe second estimate of Q4 GDP confirms that the recovery slowed at the tail end of 2014, but has become better balanced,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. \u201cThe one wrinkle in the figures is the 1.4% quarterly fall in business investment \u2013 the second in a row. But this seems to reflect the cancellation of investment plans in the oil sector, rather than a wider malaise. \u201cAll in all, the latest GDP figures need not ring any alarm bells regarding the strength or sustainability of the UK economy\u2019s recovery.\u201d However, the UK recovery is still heavily reliant on consumers. While business investment fell in the fourth quarter, household spending increased by 0.5%. Meanwhile, of all the key output measures \u2013 services, production and construction \u2013 the services sector is the only one to have surpassed pre-crisis levels. Between October and December, service sector output increased by 0.8%, unchanged from the ONS\u2019s first estimate. Production was revised up to 0.1% growth from an earlier estimate of a 0.1% decline, helped by an upward revision of manufacturing output growth to 0.2% from 0.1%. Construction output, however, was revised down to a 2.1% fall in the fourth quarter, bigger than the 1.8% drop estimated previously. The government has argued that in order to secure a sustainable future, the UK economy must rebalance away from its heavy reliance on debt-fuelled consumer spending and towards more manufacturing and exports. However, little progress has been made and the British Chambers of Commerce believes the chancellor\u2019s target set in 2012 to double UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020 looks out of reach.",

      "bodyText": "Anxious savers withdrew \u20ac12bn (\u00a38.8bn) from Greece\u2019s banks in January, underlining the desperate challenge facing Athens\u2019 anti-austerity ministers during last week\u2019s debt talks. Figures for February are not yet available from the European Central Bank, but the exodus is likely to have continued after the Syriza-led coalition came to power, and battled to secure a four-month extension on its \u20ac172bn bailout loan. With the ECB offering only limited support to Greek banks under the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) programme, the scale of the capital flight suggests Athens had to strike a deal last week to halt a bank run that could have endangered the country\u2019s financial system. Its finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who led last week\u2019s Brussels negotiations, eventually secured an agreement in principle on extending emergency funding for Greece. On Thursday, he boasted that deposits had since flooded back into the country. \u201cThere was a deposit flight back into the Greek banking sector,\u201d Varoufakis told Bloomberg TV. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of direction.

The Treasury committee chairman, Andrew Tyrie, pointed out the bank was not just facing criticism over its past Swiss subsidiary but over contemporary events, including \u201cinterest rate derivative selling, Libor manipulation, Eurobor manipulation, mis-selling mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Forex rigging, weakness in money laundering, credit default swaps \u2026 rigging precious metals\u201d and was involved in \u201cvarious class action lawsuits over the Bernie Madoff fraud\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible list,\u201d Flint admitted. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC\u2019s chief executive, was also asked about his pay arrangements, but said they had not been intended to avoid tax. He conceded it looked strange that his salary while at HSBC in Hong Kong had been placed into a Panamanian account, but he insisted he had made no tax benefit as a result. He said he had made the arrangement in 1998 purely to hide his salary from HSBC staff who might have been able to see it. \u201cI can understand how people find these kind of arrangements unusual and rather strange,\u201d he said. Both bankers insisted they had not discussed the activities at HSBC\u2019s Swiss arm with anyone at the Treasury, but said they had held two meetings with HM Revenue and Customs. Gulliver also said the bank had not used its UK newspaper advertising budget to manipulate editorial coverage, but he said some adverts due to be in the Daily Telegraph had been postponed, not cancelled, when the paper highlighted HSBC\u2019s activities in Jersey.",
