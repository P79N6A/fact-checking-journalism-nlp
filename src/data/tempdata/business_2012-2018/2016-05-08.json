      "bodyText": "About \u00a310m will be paid in compensation to more than 250 building workers who were \u201cblacklisted\u201d by some of Britain\u2019s biggest construction firms under a settlement to be announced on Monday. The total payout from the out-of-court deal secured from Sir Robert McAlpine, Balfour Beatty and six other building companies by the Unite union on behalf of almost 800 unfairly targeted workers could be as high as \u00a375m. The blacklist resulted in hundreds of workers losing their jobs and being unable to secure new ones after being deemed troublemakers while raising legitimate workplace issues. The construction industry used to monitor more than 3,000 building workers through a shadowy organisation, the Consulting Association, which was eventually raided by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office after earlier revelations in the Guardian. \u201cThe massive scale of the agreed damages shows the gravity of the misdeeds of major construction companies which created and used the Consulting Group as a vehicle to enable them to blacklist trade unionists,\u201d said Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union. \u201cThe sums to be paid out go a considerable way to acknowledge the hurt, suffering and loss of income our members and their families have been through over many years,\u201d he added. The blacklist is believed to have operated for 30 years \u2013 including during the 1980s when unrelated abuses of power have been highlighted recently over policing at the Hillsborough football disaster and at the miners\u2019 dispute at Orgreave. The secret files seized by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office apparently included defamatory references to workers such as: \u201cwill cause trouble, strong TU [trade union]\u201d, \u201cex-shop steward, definite problems\u201d and \u201cIrish ex-army, bad egg\u201d. Unite said payouts under the latest settlement could range from \u00a325,000 to \u00a3200,000 per claimant, depending on such factors as the loss of income and the seriousness of the defamation. The GMB union, which reached a settlement last month, said it believed the total value of compensation in the case was about \u00a375m for 771 claimants, with legal costs on both sides estimated at \u00a325m. Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O\u2019Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and Vinci said they had settled the litigation between them and individuals represented by Unite, bringing an end to all legal claims. \u201cThese construction companies wish to draw a line under this matter and continue to work together with the trade unions at national, regional and site level to ensure that the modern UK construction industry provides the highest standards of employment and HR (human resources)practice for its workforce,\u201d a statement said. McCluskey said that, under the agreement, building workers could once more apply for jobs in the construction industry without fear of discrimination. \u201cThis settlement is a clear statement on behalf of the trade union movement that never again can such nefarious activities be allowed to happen against decent working people trying to earn an honest living in a tough industry. \u201cThe wheels of justice may turn slowly but, like Hillsborough, eventually justice is done and is seen to be done. \u201cThe message is clear that there can never be any hiding place for bosses in the construction and any other industry thinking of reverting to shameful blacklisting practices against committed trade unionists.\u201d Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, said: \u201cWe have secured \u00a35.4m of justice for the GMB members blacklisted by powerful construction companies who thought they were above the law. \u201cFor decades household-name construction companies implemented an illegal blacklisting system, which denied a generation of trade union activists and health and safety reps an opportunity to provide for themselves and their families. Finally they have been held to account in public and at great cost to them financially and reputationally. \u201cPreventing 3,213 workers earning a living to support their families was a gross injustice, and government and employers\u2019 organisations must never forget this sordid episode. Without strong regulation and penalties holding them to account, employers will always be tempted to put profit above people.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than $12tn (\u00a38tn) has been siphoned out of Russia, China and other emerging economies into the secretive world of offshore finance, new research has revealed, as David Cameron prepares to host world leaders for an anti-corruption summit. A detailed 18-month research project has uncovered a sharp increase in the capital flowing offshore from developing countries, in particular Russia and China. The analysis, carried out by Columbia University professor James S Henry for the Tax Justice Network, shows that by the end of 2014, $1.3tn of assets from Russia were sitting offshore. The figures, which came from compiling and cross-checking data from global institutions including the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations, follow the Panama Papers revelations of global, systemic tax avoidance. Chinese citizens have $1.2tn stashed away in tax havens, once estimates for Hong Kong and Macau are included. Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia \u2013 all of which have seen high-profile corruption scandals in recent years \u2013 also come high on the list of the worst-affected countries. Henry, a former chief economist at consultancy McKinsey, told the Guardian his research underlined the fact that tax-dodging was not the only motivation for using tax havens \u2013 criminals and kleptocrats also made prolific use of their services to keep their wealth secret and their money safe. He said the list of users of offshore jurisdictions was like the cantina scene in Star Wars, where a motley group of unsavoury intergalactic characters is assembled. Henry said: \u201cIt\u2019s like the Star Wars scene: you have the tax dodgers in one corner, the arms dealers in another, the kleptocrats over here. There\u2019s also those using tax havens for money laundering, or fraud.\u201d Oil-rich countries including Nigeria and Angola feature as key sources of offshore funds, the research finds, as do Brazil and Argentina. Henry said the owners of this hidden capital were often so keen to secure secrecy and avoid their wealth being appropriated back home, that they were willing to accept paltry financial returns rather than investing it in ways that might promote economic development. Charging just 1% tax on this mountain of offshore wealth would yield more than $120bn a year, almost equivalent to the entire $131bn global aid budget. The TJN is urging Cameron to push for agreement on a series of issues at anti-corruption summit on Thursday, including a tougher crackdown on the banks, lawyers and other professionals who facilitate financial secrecy and an obligation on all politicians to make their personal financial situation transparent. The project is an update, for developing countries, on 2012 research which showed that, worldwide, more than $20tn was stashed away offshore. Henry said the number of tax havens had continued to increase over the period he studied, despite growing public pressure for action. On average, he said, the offshore capital belonging to developing countries had increased at 8% a year since 2010; 9% a year for China and Russia, perhaps because of fears of economic and political instability. \u201cPeople are voting with their feet,\u201d he said. The prime minister published a summary of his tax affairs last month, after the Panama Papers leaks revealed that his father had set up an investment fund, Blairmore, based in the offshore jurisdiction of Panama. Henry argued that when senior figures in authoritarian states such as China use tax havens to guard their money safely, they were effectively free-riding on the legal and financial systems of other countries. \u201cAll of these felons and kleptocrats are, in a way, essentially dependent on the rule of law when it comes to protecting their money,\u201d he said. He said it was not just exotic locations such as the Cayman Islands where money could effectively be hidden, but also some US states, such as Delaware, where it is possible for foreign investors to start up and run a company without making clear its ultimate ownership \u2013 something all UK firms will have to do from later this year.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s interest rate setters meet against a gloomy economic backdrop this week that could prompt at least one policymaker to push for a cut in borrowing costs to shore up stalling growth. The nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) is not expected to make any changes to the record low base rate of 0.5% on Thursday. But investors will be scouring minutes of the latest meeting and the Bank\u2019s new forecasts for the economy released at the same time for clues as to whether the next move will be up or down. \u201cA run of weak activity surveys for April suggest that the economy may see growth in the second quarter slow compared to the first quarter\u2019s already insipid performance,\u201d said Martin Beck at the consultancy Oxford Economics. \u201cUncertainty caused by June\u2019s EU referendum has been widely blamed. But with the economy slackening well before the referendum date was announced, it is difficult to believe that this is the only story. One thing that is clear is that the possibility of a cut in interest rates is looking ever less outlandish.\u201d Markets are not pricing in any policy move this year and the Bank\u2019s policymakers have also signalled that rates are going nowhere for now, given the upcoming referendum on EU membership is clouding the economic outlook. At the same time, there has been a clear message from governor Mark Carney that when there is a change in borrowing costs it is more likely to be up than down. However, a recent run of bad news on the economy may have chipped away at Carney and other policymakers\u2019 certainty on the path for interest rates, say experts. The committee could discuss cuts at this meeting even if most members are not close to voting for such a move. Both the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, and external MPC member Jan Vlieghe have discussed the possibility of cutting rates in the past. As such, they are seen as the most likely to push for lower borrowing costs after business surveys last week added to signs that the UK economy is losing momentum. Last week\u2019s PMI reports on the main sectors of Britain\u2019s economy showed growth had dropped to the weakest pace in three years for construction firms, manufacturers and Britain\u2019s vast banks-to-bars services industry. The surveys\u2019 compilers, Markit, said that pointed to GDP growth of just 0.1% in April, down from 0.4% in the first quarter of the year. On the high street, the demise of BHS and Austin Reed has fanned fears that the consumer engine driving Britain\u2019s economy is stalling. The signs from the global economy have also been worrying investors, including news on Friday that the US added far fewer jobs than expected last month. Another issue that will be troubling UK policymakers is the EU referendum on 23 June. The Bank has already warned that businesses will likely defer spending decisions until after the vote, knocking overall economic growth in the second quarter of the year. But presenting the Bank\u2019s latest \u201cinflation report\u201d forecasts on Thursday at a news conference, Carney may be careful not to venture further into the Brexit debate. Chris Hare, an economist at the bank Investec, commented: \u201cFrom a communications perspective, this inflation report will be extremely awkward for the MPC.\u201d \u201cIssues relating to the vote are clearly affecting the MPC\u2019s read of the economy and its monetary policy outlook. But, at the same time, the committee might naturally shy away from wading further into a highly charged political debate.\u201d \u201cAll told, we expect this Super Thursday to see the MPC very much in \u2018wait and see\u2019 mode as it rides out the communications challenges of the EU referendum.\u201d According to the Sunday Times, the Bank has held \u2018informal discussions\u2019 with UK banks over whether their balance sheets could handle a rate cut. New economic indicators published today will do little to assuage fears the economic is losing steam. Business activity and employment lost momentum across England and Wales in April, according to the latest Lloyds Bank regional purchasing managers\u2019 index. The survey\u2019s measure of business activity across England\u2019s private sector was the lowest for more than three years. Wales\u2019s business activity index registered its second-lowest reading since February 2013. But it still showed a faster rate of growth than the average across England for the third month in a row. Companies said last month\u2019s introduction of the \u2018national living wage\u2019 was weighing on hiring. \u201cThe majority of regions have started the second quarter on a weaker footing, with business activity no longer showing the robust growth that we have seen over the past two to three years,\u201d said Tim Hinton, managing director for mid-markets and SME banking at Lloyds Banking Group. \u201cA knock-on effect of stronger cost pressures from the \u2018national living wage\u2019 and higher fuel prices has seen a slowing in the rate of job creation, which was at a 32-month low in April.\u201d A separate report from accountants BDO suggested that UK firms\u2019 hiring intentions had fallen sharply to levels last seen in 2014. But its Business Trends Report suggested firms remained upbeat about growth in the coming six months.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At first appearances, Dan Vo\u2019s new range of wool jackets for men appear to be pieces of well-made clothing with the price tag to match. Behind that appearance however is a precise method of design, where every part of the jacket has been cut exactly from a piece of fabric in a jigsaw pattern to ensure there is no waste of material in making it. Vo, a Scotland-based fashion designer, has designed a coat in which the uncut arms, collar, front, back, pockets and other sections all fit together perfectly on the piece of fabric. When they are cut out to make the jacket, she can then avoid wasting material, as is typically the case when conventional coats are made. \u201cIf you had a normal pattern, you would have every single individual piece lying next to each other but it would not be so close to be attached so you have gaps in between. They cut around it so you have pieces there that you cannot use. And the way that I try to construct it is that every single thing matches,\u201d she said. Originally from Germany of Vietnamese descent, Vo is a proponent of the \u201cZero Waste\u201d movement within the fashion industry, which aims to create little or no waste from producing clothes. In many cases, when a piece of clothing is being cut at present, she said, between 15% and 30% of a piece of fabric can be wasted as the designer cuts. To eliminate waste, Vo takes a 200cm by 145cm piece of fabric and fits the various pieces of arms and pockets in a jigsaw around the front and the back of the coat. Similar methods of exacting measurements to cut down on waste have also been used in house construction in recent years. Positioning the patterns in this way eliminates wastage, but takes more time, Vo says. \u201cWhen you create a garment in the normal way you can be very creative; you can displace the patterns everywhere and it is easier to get the fit right. But when you work with zero waste patterns, you have to work with the rectangular shape that fits on the fabric so in that sense you are a bit limited but you can work around it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe point is that I am making something which is very wearable. People look at it and they would not have a clue that I am working in this way. I chose it because I think it is important to reduce the impact that we have on the environment. I think if you master this technique you can transfer it into so many different garments.\u201d Several campaign groups are pushing the fashion industry to reduce the levels of waste generated by clothes production. Fashion Revolution, a UK-based not-for-profit group which pushes for greater transparency and to tackle to environmental side effects of garment production, says just 20% of textiles are recycled each year. In the UK, 2m tonnes of clothing and textiles are thrown away every year, according to a report from the group. \u201cWorking in the industry, just seeing how much we actually produce \u2013 besides everything else because it is quite polluting starting off with the raw material \u2013 it is already not very sustainable. But then when it comes to the process of making garments, most of the time it is done really quickly and there are lots of offcuts which are not recycled. Maybe a part of it is recycled but most of the time, the manufacturers just chuck it and it just goes to landfill,\u201d said Vo. In some cases, pieces of fabric may be thrown away due to secrecy amongdesigners who do not want others to be able to replicate their pieces, she said. Achieving the master design of Vo\u2019s jackets involved a lot of trial and error. When one piece is changed, the rest of the pieces must be moved around the master shape. Where a typical design could take a few days, the jacket took months. \u201cEvery time you figure out something is too short you have to move everything around again. It is like a puzzle almost,\u201d says Vo, who got faster once she worked out the first pattern. But Vo\u2019s method can be challenged by patterns such as a check or a herringbone, which must be cut a certain way. \u201cI can\u2019t just make anything I want. It always just has to fit within the space again. On the other hand you can just work your way around it, you just have to experiment.\u201d Vo is about to go into production with her first range of the jackets, which will be produced in Scotland. They will go on sale in October aimed at 25- to 45-year-old men. Priced at between \u00a3450 and \u00a3500, they are firmly in the higher end of the market although she says that collaboration with a high street brand could mean they are available for a wider audience in the future. \u201cI am a supporter of slow fashion. I believe in buying a garment that you wear for longer, not buying a lot of cheaper clothes. What disturbs me is not just that we have pre-consumer waste, essentially the offcuts that we produce and we chuck them, but also waste after the clothes are bought. \u201cWe are producing so many garments and the turnaround is so quick so the lifecycle of clothes is so short.\u201d You can read our archive of The innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how the Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The experts said it could never happen. There was no way in which Donald Trump could win the Republican nomination for the US presidency. Could a billionaire who had never held office, was distrusted by the party hierarchy, lacked a political machine and seemed to take delight in upsetting large chunks of the electorate really survive the primaries and have a shot at the White House? Well, really. The smart money now says that Trump has no chance in a head-to-head presidential race with Hillary Clinton, who looks nailed-on as the candidate for the Democrats. Opinion polls suggest that Clinton would beat Trump by a margin of 10 percentage points were the election to be held now. But Americans are not going to pick the next resident of the White House for another six months. That is an awfully long time in politics and 10-point deficits have been overturned in the past. It is by no means inconceivable that Trump will succeed Barack Obama. Indeed, the state of the US economy suggests that he has a fighting chance. The first point to recognise is that the economy is struggling. Growth slowed to an annualised 0.5% in the first three months of 2016, which means that it was barely expanding at all. Unlike in previous years, this could not be blamed on inclement weather. Jobs are still being created but at a slower pace. Last week\u2019s figures for non-farm payrolls \u2013 the benchmark for the state of the labour market \u2013 showed an increase of 160,000 in employment last month, well below the 200,000 Wall Street had been expecting. Disappointing economic data has become rather too common in recent months. Investment activity has been weak, with companies taking advantage of low interest rates to buy back their own shares rather than investing in new plant and machinery. That has helped keep share prices high but at a cost. Productivity growth, as in the UK, has been poor. The result has been only a modest growth in wages, which are still only growing at 2.5% a year despite the recovery from the Great Recession of 2008-09 now into its eighth year. But the pick-up in pay has been enough to squeeze corporate profits, which makes share prices look overvalued. At best, the US looks set for growth of about 2% this year, but it would not take much \u2013 a sharp plunge on Wall Street, for example \u2013 for the economy to turn sour in the run-up to polling day in early November. The second point to recognise is that millions of Americans think they have been left behind. This has certainly not been a period where a rising tide lifts all boats; the gains from what has been a strikingly undynamic recovery by US standards have gone to the few, not the many. Trump, despite being a billionaire, has managed to tap into a seething well of discontent. So has Bernie Sanders. This has created a political dynamic in which it is possible for Trump to portray himself as the anti-establishment figure who voices the concerns of the little guy in the states the elite fly over as they travel from coast to coast. His platform is unashamedly populist: he wants interest rates to stay low and the minimum wage and spending on the military to go up. He is in favour of a big expansion of infrastructure spending, higher benefits for armed forces veterans, 40% tariff barriers on imported goods, an end to free trade deals, and curbs on immigration including the building of a wall along the border with Mexico. Some of Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-hip comments are economically illiterate. He says he would take advantage of the fact that the US government can borrow money at very attractive rates to finance his public investment plans. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Many Democrats think that would be a good idea. But Trump has also said that if he spent a bit too much on rebuilding roads and bridges he would consider defaulting on the US national debt. This, of course, sends out a clear message to the investors who would be lending the US government the money to pay for these schemes. If there is a chance that Washington would renege on its debts, interest rates on the loans will be higher to take account of the extra risk. The same applies to the plan to oust Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve Board. Trump does not object to the way in which the US central bank has tried to keep interest rates as low as possible, merely the fact that Yellen is a Democrat not a Republican. The threat that Trump would replace Yellen with a Republican at the first opportunity makes the future conduct of US monetary policy look less certain and, again, long-term interest rates may rise as a result. Slowing US growth has already given Yellen and her Fed colleagues a good reason to delay the increase in US interest rates that some on Wall Street are expecting next month. Trump has just provided the most powerful central banker in the world with another. On the one hand, she knows that if she keeps the economy out of recession she improves Clinton\u2019s chances of winning. On the other, she could be out of a job if the economy stagnates, because in those circumstances the odds on Trump will shorten. Who knows, there may be a method to Trump\u2019s madness. By coming out with inflammatory statements he makes it more likely that there will be a tightening of financial market conditions over the summer, leading to weaker economic activity and the real possibility of a stock market crash. Clinton would no doubt try to blame any problems on her opponent and say that he has demonstrated how unfit he is for the highest office in the land. But she knows from the experience of 1992, when her husband Bill was running for the White House, how important the economy is in deciding the race. As far as Clinton is concerned, the longer Yellen refrains from raising interest rates the better. Imagine there is a Wall Street crash over the summer and the economy tanks. Would America opt for experience or the self-styled outsider? Trump does not have a coherent programme and it may well collapse under the intense scrutiny of the next few months. But he is gambling that what he says will have an appeal at a gut level and will contrast with the dry arguments presented by his opponent. Clinton is going to find herself attacked from the left on some issues and from the right on others. She is going to have to be quick on her feet because one thing the Republican primaries have shown is that Trump is one heck of a salesman.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has a fairy godmother who, with a wave of her wand, showers money over much of the population. It hardly seems possible in this age of austerity, but it happens all the time and soothes the anger of many who might otherwise protest at the closure of local amenities and cuts to welfare budgets. This godmother comes in several guises, but essentially always does the same thing: she steals from the future to pay for things today. And Osborne is not a bystander in this. He has created the conditions for this heist and in some cases become the fairy godmother himself \u2013 helping to soften his image and create millions of mini-lottery winners he hopes will vote for him in 2020. Last week we heard from the insurer Legal &amp; General how the \u201cBank of Mum and Dad\u201d will help finance 25% of UK mortgage transactions this year. It said parents could find themselves lending their children as much as \u00a35bn to help them on to the property ladder, providing deposits for more than 300,000 mortgages. Some of the money will come from savings, but there are estimates that much of the \u00a32.7bn extracted from retirement plans under Osborne\u2019s new liberalised pension rules has gone straight into funding mortgage deposits for children and grandchildren. And that\u2019s not all. Osborne has also benefited from the \u00a353bn extracted from the banks since 2010. This money is the punishment for the PPI rip-off scandal, the foreign exchange fixing scam, the Libor interest rate racket and the recklessness that meant banks needed to be punished for nearly going bust in 2008. The financial regulators have acted like Camelot, the lottery operator, which takes every contribution and then redistributes them unevenly according to an agreed formula. For most people who have received a slice of the estimated \u00a325bn of PPI compensation, it doesn\u2019t feel like compensation. They never really missed the money in the first place. It is more like a tax break to be spent on a new car, a loft extension or conservatory. The rest of the \u00a353bn has gone to compensation-claims companies, which show up in official figures as one of the biggest recruiters of the last five years, and to the regulators themselves and the Treasury, which has used the levy to subsidise government spending and disguise the extent of austerity. The bank levy boosted the exchequer with \u00a32.2bn in 2014. This money flowed into the economy, where once it would have filled the pockets of shareholders, many of them pension funds. Legal &amp; General echoes the sentiment of many on the left who say flogging the family silver and stealing from the future cannot go on. Sadly, they couldn\u2019t be more wrong. There is always a fairy godmother waiting to dispense good cheer. The insurer argues that the Bank of Mum and Dad will soon run dry, saying that in London parental contributions were so great they made up more than 50% of the wealth (excluding property) of the average household. But what is to stop wealth extraction continuing? Such is the postwar accumulation of wealth that the net value of UK property is more than \u00a34 trillion and these days more people own their home outright than have a mortgage. Windfalls from selling the family silver are also an essential element of Osborne\u2019s attempts to balance the budget over the next five years, just as they were for his mentors, Lords Howe, Lawson and Lamont \u2013 the Tory chancellors who dominated the 1980s and early 1990s. Privatisations in the 1980s were followed by demutualisations in the 1990s and the personal borrowing boom in the 2000s, supplemented by compensation for endowment mis-selling and personal pension mis-selling. In each case, millions of families were able to boost their largely static incomes with one windfall after another. The chancellor has already sold the Royal Mail and plans to offload the rest of Lloyds Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland. Those banks could have been a benefit to the nation in years to come when they had either fully recovered and commanded a good price or proved useful as state-owned investors in small businesses and the green economy. Instead, they will be offloaded at the earliest opportunity to support Osborne\u2019s short-term aim of achieving a budget surplus. Housebuilding is a priority, but the Treasury believes there is no need to fund housing associations with cash when you can let them borrow. Likewise, other public bodies that were once directly funded will borrow just to meet their statutory obligations. Banks are offering mortgages that will mean borrowers making monthly payments into their 80s, allowing people to spend more today on purchasing a home, with Osborne\u2019s permission, than the old rules would allow. Universities are another example. They are squealing for more money to prevent standards dropping. Osborne has already put most of the bill for university funding on the credit card, via his loan scheme landing graduates with upwards of \u00a340,000 of debt. He is expected to simply raise the \u00a39,000-a-year fee cap to allow students a higher credit limit. Next stop will be selling the student loan book \u2013 again bringing forward funds that will need to be repaid at a later date. Like a plate-spinning conjuror, Osborne knows it is bad economics to rely on a fairy godmother turning up every year to boost living standards: yet it has proved successful ever since the 1980s and will probably underpin his plans for the next four years.",

Such is the postwar accumulation of wealth that the net value of UK property is more than \u00a34 trillion and these days more people own their home outright than have a mortgage.</p> <p>Windfalls from selling the family silver are also an essential element of Osborne\u2019s attempts to balance the budget over the next five years, just as they were for his mentors, Lords Howe, Lawson and Lamont \u2013 the Tory chancellors who dominated the 1980s and early 1990s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"503ba47dcdbf28e9448d5a0c476229dc00580df3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/503ba47dcdbf28e9448d5a0c476229dc00580df3/0_44_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyds bank cash machines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lloyds: being offloaded as soon as possible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Privatisations in the 1980s were followed by demutualisations in the 1990s and the personal borrowing boom in the 2000s, supplemented by compensation for endowment mis-selling and personal pension mis-selling. In each case, millions of families were able to boost their largely static incomes with one windfall after another.</p> <p>The chancellor has already sold the Royal Mail and plans to offload the rest of Lloyds Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland. Those banks could have been a benefit to the nation in years to come when they had either fully recovered and commanded a good price or proved useful as state-owned investors in small businesses and the green economy. Instead, they will be offloaded at the earliest opportunity to support Osborne\u2019s short-term aim of achieving a budget surplus.</p> <p>Housebuilding is a priority, but the Treasury believes there is no need to fund housing associations with cash when you can let them borrow. Likewise, other public bodies that were once directly funded will borrow just to meet their statutory obligations.</p> <p>Banks are offering mortgages that will mean borrowers making monthly payments into their 80s, allowing people to spend more today on purchasing a home, with Osborne\u2019s permission, than the old rules would allow.</p> <p>Universities are another example. They are squealing for more money to prevent standards dropping. Osborne has already put most of the bill for university funding on the credit card, via his loan scheme landing graduates with upwards of \u00a340,000 of debt. He is expected to simply raise the \u00a39,000-a-year fee cap to allow students a higher credit limit. Next stop will be selling the student loan book \u2013 again bringing forward funds that will need to be repaid at a later date.</p> <p>Like a plate-spinning conjuror, Osborne knows it is bad economics to rely on a fairy godmother turning up every year to boost living standards: yet it has proved successful ever since the 1980s and will probably underpin his plans for the next four years.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The last time the Bank of England cut interest rates was in March 2009 and the decision was, in the modern idiom, a bit of a no-brainer. Official figures released later that month showed unemployment rising above two million for the first time since 1997, and the economy was in freefall. It was the nadir of the global slump and Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee had no hesitation in reducing the cost of borrowing to 0.5%, comfortably lower than it had ever been in the history of the Bank, which stretches all the way back to 1694. The belief in the City was that the Bank would not leave interest rates at this level for long. Speculation about when the MPC would start nudging up borrowing costs began almost immediately. But it is now seven years, two months and counting since that cut, and still the Bank has not budged. What\u2019s more, there are plenty of arguments in favour of the next move in rates being down rather than up. Reason number one is that the economy is slowing. It is not just that GDP growth eased from 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2016. Rather, it is that the prospects for the second quarter look even worse. Each month, data firm Markit produces forward-looking surveys for activity in the three main sectors of the economy: services, manufacturing and construction. The results, released last week, showed that all three sectors were at their weakest since the first half of 2013. According to Markit, the findings of the three surveys are consistent with growth slowing to 0.1% in the second quarter, representing an economy operating at stall speed. The Bank of England prides itself on being pro-active and pre-emptive, stepping in early so that it does not have to play catch-up. On that basis, there is a case for a cut in interest rates when the MPC meets later this week. The chances of it opting for a fresh stimulus are, however, slim. For a start, Markit\u2019s prediction of 0.1% growth in the second quarter are based on incomplete evidence. It is still only early May, and the end of the second quarter is almost two months away. A lot can happen in that time. Even if, as seems likely, the Markit forecast turns out to be accurate, Mark Carney and his MPC colleagues have a ready-made excuse for sitting on their hands: the threat of Brexit. For the time being, all poor economic data can be blamed on caution being shown by businesses and consumers before the referendum on 23 June. The assumption is that individuals are putting off spending decisions and that companies are shelving investment decisions until they know the outcome of the referendum. If the polls are right and Britain remains in the EU, the economy will then boom in the second half of the year, as it makes up all the ground lost in the first six months. That\u2019s the theory at least. But it all rather relies on the threat of Brexit being the sole reason for the slowdown in the economy, and under scrutiny this doesn\u2019t stand up. For example, it is hard to understand why the Brexit threat should be responsible for the increase in unemployment by 21,000 in the latest ONS figures, given that the period covered was November 2015 to February 2016, and it was only at the end of the latter month that the referendum was announced. This argument is given weight by the slowdown seen on the other side of the Atlantic. Given that the UK tends to follow the US with a short lag, it would not be that much of a surprise if one or two MPC members voted for a rate cut this week. Get ready for peak oil The end of the oil era has been predicted for so long that it has ceased to attract much interest. Critics rightly say it\u2019s now difficult to know who to believe. Were not forecasters urging governments to go green not so long ago, because we had reached \u201cpeak oil\u201d and the world was running out of crude? And yet now we are awash with the stuff, hence the collapse in oil prices. But it still gives observers pause for thought when someone of the stature of Professor Paul Stephens, oil expert at Chatham House, states baldly that Shell, BP et al have 10 years to adapt or die, as he did last week. Although he is seen as close to the industry, he nevertheless believes Big Oil should diversify into renewables, perform mega-mergers or slim down to cope with a brave new world where oil demand will fall, carbon regulations will grow and high-cost oil reserves will be stranded. His gloomy prognosis follows the annual general meeting season in which an increasing number of Big Oil shareholders questioned whether businesses were sufficiently prepared for the likely outcomes from the recent UN climate change agreement negotiated in Paris and signed in New York. And it comes just weeks after Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, announced plans to sell off at least part of its hydrocarbon inheritance to reduce its dependency on oil revenue. There is no doubt that volumes of oil \u2013 and, particularly, lower-carbon gas \u2013 will be needed well into the 2030s. The global transport system is still heavily dependent on black gold and full electrification is a long way off. But change is happening quickly too. The sale of electric cars in Norway last year grew by 71%. Almost one in five cars there is a plug-in despite the nation being a major crude producer. So the end of the oil era is not for the birds \u2013 or even the birdwatchers, the environmentalists, or the anti-oil obsessives. It is now becoming part of fund-manager and mainstream dialogue. Change is coming. Going for broke on BHS Tomorrow sees the start of MPs\u2019 inquiries into the collapse of BHS and why its pension fund has a \u00a3571m deficit. Two select committees \u2013 work and pensions, chaired by the redoubtable Frank Field, and business, innovation and skills, chaired by Ian Wright \u2013 will start by quizzing the pensions regulator and the Pension Protection Fund. The main figures in this scandal \u2013 Dominic Chappell, the former bankrupt whose consortium owned BHS at the moment of its demise, and prior owner Sir Philip Green, who received more than \u00a3500m from BHS in dividends, rent and other fees \u2013 will come later. Many issues must be addressed, from the role of the pension trustees to the cash handed to Green. Field has said that if he doesn\u2019t get a pension settlement, Green should lose his knighthood. Green reckons that means Field has prejudged who is guilty before any evidence or explanations have been heard. He has a point. Field has been unwise.",

Metaphorically donning the silk dressing gowns and shadow boxing their way into the ring will be Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the Pension Protection Fund, plus Lesley Titcomb and Nicola Parish, respectively chief executive and director of case management at the Pensions Regulator. They will face a tag-team of inquisitors: Field\u2019s work and pensions select committee, and the business, innovation and skills (BIS) committee chaired by Iain \u201cLeading\u201d Wright. Field has already irked the medallion stallion with some low blows before the bell has rung, but it looks doubtful whether punches will be pulled for the number crunchers. In the pre-bout publicity, Field jabs: \u201cA major aim of the work and pensions committee representatives will be to test how adequately both organisations have carried out their duties to help protect members\u2019 pensions under the existing law, whether the existing law is inadequate and, if so, how should it be strengthened, or whether existing powers are adequate but were not fully exercised.\u201d Seconds out. Osborne\u2019s song remains the same In other Westminster grilling news, the chancellor, George Osborne, will be appearing in front of the Treasury select committee on Wednesday, to be quizzed about the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union. Well, that\u2019s what it says on the tin, although when Osborne speaks about UK membership of the EU, he tends to talk about the exact opposite. That\u2019s what happened last month, when the chancellor\u2019s mandarins published a 200-page tome entitled \u201cHM Treasury analysis: the long-term economic impact of EU membership and the alternatives\u201d, which put the emphasis squarely on the alternatives. You\u2019ll recall that the study claimed UK GDP would shrink by 6% by 2030 if we vote to leave the EU, which apparently would cost every household the equivalent of \u00a34,300 a year. Well, maybe. But without wanting to belittle the work of serious economists, most dismal scientists struggle to predict where they\u2019ll have dinner \u2013 so 2030 is heroic guesswork. Meanwhile, that \u00a34,300 figure is based on dividing their guess on how much GDP the UK will have missed out on, by the number of UK households. It is stretching it to imply that\u2019s income. Sympathy for the bookies? A high-rolling punter stumbles into a fancy casino and turns \u00a31m into chips. Before he starts playing cards, he gets talked into spending \u00a35 on the casino\u2019s own lottery game, which boasts a first prize of \u00a325,000. The punter then hits the tables and loses the whole million. Still, on his way out, the punter gets collared by a croupier and informed that very few people bought lottery tickets, so he\u2019s scooped the top prize. Would anybody have any sympathy for the casino manager if he then started moaning that he\u2019d lost \u00a325,000? Yet that is effectively what the bookies have been asking everybody to believe with their constant bleating about Leicester City winning the Premier League, having started the season at odds of 5,000-1. What really happened was the bookies coined it in all season on the back of freak results, only to hand a fraction back last week. We may get a reality check on this on Wednesday, when William Hill gives a trading update and holds its annual general meeting \u2013 but don\u2019t, er, bet on it. The myth of the bookies being fleeced by Leicester\u2019s triumph comes second only to the even more unbelievable line that the Foxes triumph was football\u2019s \u201cgreatest fairy tale\u201d. No: it was the third-greatest footballing fairy tale in the East Midlands \u2013 in the past 44 years.",

Well, that\u2019s what it says on the tin, although when Osborne speaks about UK membership of the EU, he tends to talk about the exact opposite.</p> <p>That\u2019s what happened last month, when the chancellor\u2019s mandarins published a 200-page tome entitled \u201cHM Treasury analysis: the long-term economic impact of EU membership and the alternatives\u201d, which put the emphasis squarely on the alternatives. You\u2019ll recall that the study claimed UK GDP would shrink by 6% by 2030 if we vote to leave the EU, which apparently would cost every household the equivalent of \u00a34,300 a year.</p> <p>Well, maybe. But without wanting to belittle the work of serious economists, most dismal scientists struggle to predict where they\u2019ll have dinner \u2013 so 2030 is heroic guesswork. Meanwhile, that \u00a34,300 figure is based on dividing their guess on how much GDP the UK will have missed out on, by the number of UK households. It is stretching it to imply that\u2019s income.</p> <h2>Sympathy for the bookies?<br></h2> <p>A high-rolling punter stumbles into a fancy casino and turns \u00a31m into chips. Before he starts playing cards, he gets talked into spending \u00a35 on the casino\u2019s own lottery game, which boasts a first prize of \u00a325,000. The punter then hits the tables and loses the whole million.</p> <p>Still, on his way out, the punter gets collared by a croupier and informed that very few people bought lottery tickets, so he\u2019s scooped the top prize.</p> <p>Would anybody have any sympathy for the casino manager if he then started moaning that he\u2019d lost \u00a325,000? Yet that is effectively what the bookies have been asking everybody to believe with their constant bleating about Leicester City winning the Premier League, having started the season at odds of 5,000-1. What really happened was the bookies coined it in all season on the back of freak results, only to hand a fraction back last week.</p> <p>We may get a reality check on this on Wednesday, when William Hill gives a trading update and holds its annual general meeting \u2013 but don\u2019t, er, bet on it. The myth of the bookies being fleeced by Leicester\u2019s triumph comes second only to the even more unbelievable line that the Foxes triumph was football\u2019s \u201cgreatest fairy tale\u201d. No: it was the third-greatest footballing fairy tale in the East Midlands \u2013 in the past 44 years.</p>",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s exports slumped nearly 2% in April compared with the same month last year, as imports fell almost 11%, officials said on Sunday, the latest sign of weakness in the world\u2019s second largest economy. The export sector has shown year-on-year declines in dollar terms for nine of the last 10 months as the country\u2019s economic growth has fallen to its slowest level in a quarter-century. April imports fell for the 18th consecutive month, suggesting domestic demand remains weak despite a pickup in infrastructure spending and record credit growth in the first quarter. \u201cBoth exports and imports came in weaker than expected, in line with the soft trade performance across Asia, pointing to another challenging year for emerging markets,\u201d said Zhou Hao, senior emerging market economist at Commerzbank in Singapore. China\u2019s exports to the United States \u2013 the country\u2019s biggest market - fell 9.3% in April from a year earlier, while shipments to the European Union \u2013 the second biggest market \u2013 rose 3.2%, customs data showed. China\u2019s cabinet has vowed to take steps to boost exports, including encouraging banks to boost lending, expanding export credit insurance and raise tax rebates for some firms. Sunday\u2019s figures from the state statistics bureau suggest an unexpected March export increase may have been a blip, and that meeting ambitious economic growth targets will be a challenge. China exported about $173bn worth of goods in April, the bureau said, while importing products worth $127bn. As a result, the country\u2019s trade surplus rose to about $46bn. The bureau earlier gave figures in terms of China\u2019s yuan currency, which showed a modest rise in exports in April. The dollar figure diverged as the yuan has depreciated over the last year. Beijing is attempting a difficult transition away from reliance on cheap exports and infrastructure investment towards hi-tech industry and consumer spending as its three-decade long growth model shows signs of wearing out. But it is still targeting growth of 6.5 to 7% this year, a figure some analysts say can only be reached through an unsustainable rise in bank lending. Concerns of a hard-landing in China had eased after stronger March data, but analysts have warned the rebound may be short-lived. Economists expect a slowdown in credit growth and industrial production in April although inflation could accelerate. Key data is expected over the next two weeks. \u201cThe market has to prepare a little bit for the downside risk in other Chinese data and some sort of market correction might be inevitable,\u201d Zhou said. The trade data comes after a private survey indicated this week that Chinese factory activity weakened further in April. The Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index by Caixin, which tracks activity in the country\u2019s factories and workshops, fell for the 14th consecutive month. China\u2019s economy, a vital driver of global expansion, grew 6.9% last year. But its transition is proving bumpy and the growth slowdown has alarmed investors worldwide.",
