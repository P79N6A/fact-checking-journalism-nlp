      "bodyText": "Internet grocer Ocado has bought another year to prove its retail model works after investors enthusiastically backed a \u00a335.8m fundraising and it struck a new banking deal with its lenders. Ocado shares, which had nearly halved in value over the past six months on fears it could breach its banking agreements, leaped as much as 32% after the two-pronged move was announced. Tim Steiner, its chief executive, said the response to the placing, which was \"multiple times oversubscribed\", amounted to a \"strong endorsement from both its institutional and other shareholders, and lenders who support our confidence in our business model\". He declined to name the shareholders who took part, but hinted at a \"very substantial participation from the top of our shareholder register\". Ocado's biggest shareholders include Jorn Rausing, the Tetra Pak billionaire, and hedge fund manager Nick Roditi. Ocado sold 55.9m new shares \u2013 representing just under 10% of the group's share capital \u2013 to existing shareholders, at 64p a share: a premium of 5.7% to Friday's closing price of 60.5p. It simultaneously announced a deal with its lenders, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds, that extends its \u00a3100m capital spending facility by a further 18 months to July 2015. The company said that as of last month it had net debt of \u00a393.4m, a cash balance of \u00a356m and drawings on its existing capital expenditure facility of \u00a385.3m. Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan said that although the banking deal removed \"the monkey off [Ocado's] back and management now has considerable breathing space \u2026 that does not mean that the model is suddenly a good one\". \"Ocado is still operating an inefficient model, growing below City expectations and its multichannel competitors,\" he said. Steiner insisted that the firm, which operates from a hi-tech distribution centre at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, was never in danger of breaching its banking covenants: \"100% categorically we would not have breached the agreements\". However, the company's strengthened financial position \"brought an end to that conversation\", he said. Its new finance director, Duncan Tatton-Brown, added that the terms of the new deal, which were negotiated for a \u00a31m fee, were fundamentally the same as the previous deal for 2013 and would become less onerous in subsequent years. Ocado, founded in 2000 by three former Goldman Sachs bankers and floated at 180p a share in 2010, has polarised opinion like few other market debutants. Fans point to rapid growth in online grocery sales and high customer-service ratings. Sceptics say its model of filling orders from central depots will never be as profitable as online operations at established grocers, which mostly pick orders in-store and are seeing faster online sales growth than Ocado. This year Ocado's growth had been stymied by the finite capacity of the Hatfield site and it is ploughing \u00a3210m into a second distribution centre in Dordon, Warwickshire, which is due to open early next year. The second site will dramatically increase its sales potential next year and ultimately prove to its detractors whether its centralised model can be a profitable one. The internet grocer also provided an update on current trading that showed growth accelerating as its fourth quarter progressed. Gross sales increased 11% over the 14 weeks to 11 November and were up by 13.7% in the final six weeks of the period. Steiner said the firm had benefited from the extension of its range towards 30,000 lines and the introduction of its \"low price promise\". The shares closed up 14.45p at 75p, a rise of nearly 24%.",

    "webTitle": "Wine prices set to rise after poor grape harvest, warns Majestic boss", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wine lovers are facing a worse than usual new year hangover as poor harvests in some of the world's most important wine producing regions threaten price hikes of up to \u00a31 a bottle in 2013. Majestic Wine boss Steve Lewis said the increases would be most noticeable in the supermarket where British favourites such as Italian pinot grigio, New Zealand sauvignon blanc and Australian chardonnay sell for around \u00a35 per bottle. \"I would expect to see significant price inflation at entry price points,\" he said. \"The price of a (\u00a35) bottle of pinot grigio could go up by between 50p and \u00a31 come February/March.\" A poor grape harvest in 2012 is predicted to lead to a worldwide wine shortage with the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) estimating last month that global production would fall 6% to 248.2m hectolitres \u2013 the lowest level since at least 1975 \u2013 after extreme weather disrupted harvests around the world. The hardest hit winemakers are in Argentina, where output will fall by nearly a quarter, and in Italy and France which are the world's largest producers. The power of the supermarkets, which account for three-quarters of UK wine sales, means the average bottle of wine sold in Britain costs \u00a35.01. But Majestic's competitive strength lies in the fact its average selling price is \u00a37.46, making it an important sales channel for producers with more expensive wines to sell. \"If you are the producer of an esoteric, interesting, quirky wine like Gavi di Gavi or Orvieto, and you have a lot of it, we are your go-to retailer,\" said Lewis. Lewis's comments came as Majestic reported a 4% rise in profits to \u00a39.2m for the six months to the end of September as a surge in online orders helped counteract disappointing summer trade. Like-for-likes rose by just 0.6% as wet weather saw a large number of outdoor events cancelled and cases of wine ordered by enthusiastic organisers returned to its stores. \"I measure summers by how many barbecues there are in the Lewis household and we had one in April and one in September,\" said Lewis. \"It rained and rained so customers never got into the habit of sitting in the garden sipping wine.\" Current trading has been more encouraging with UK like-for-likes up 1.2% in the last six weeks and Lewis said it was \"optimistic\" as it entered the important Christmas trading period. Three years ago Majestic lowered the minimum purchase from 12 bottles to six to encourage customers to shop with them more frequently and the retailer said the ploy had worked with the number of customers in its database who had purchased in the last 12 months up more than 11% to 594,000. That offer has now been extended to its website, fuelling a 14% rise in internet sales to \u00a312.7m. Group sales were down by \u00a31.8m at \u00a3126m after it retreated from the wholesale drinks market where the profit margins are lower. \"We think the decision to reduce the minimum purchase requirement from 12 bottles to 6 was genius,\" said Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan. \"At a time when the UK consumer is both watching their pennies and prepared to spend on quality product, this move significantly increases Majestic's target market.\"",

      "body": "<p>Wine lovers are facing a worse than usual new year hangover as poor harvests in some of the world's most important wine producing regions threaten price hikes of up to \u00a31 a bottle in 2013.</p> <p>Majestic Wine boss Steve Lewis said the increases would be most noticeable in the supermarket where British favourites such as Italian pinot grigio, New Zealand sauvignon blanc and Australian chardonnay sell for around \u00a35 per bottle.</p> <p>\"I would expect to see significant price inflation at entry price points,\" he said. \"The price of a (\u00a35) bottle of pinot grigio could go up by between 50p and \u00a31 come February/March.\"</p> <p>A poor grape harvest in 2012 is predicted to lead to a worldwide wine shortage with the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) estimating last month that global production would fall 6% to 248.2m hectolitres \u2013 the lowest level since at least 1975 \u2013 after extreme weather disrupted harvests around the world. The hardest hit winemakers are in Argentina, where output will fall by nearly a quarter, and in Italy and France which are the world's largest producers.</p> <p>The power of the supermarkets, which account for three-quarters of UK wine sales, means the average bottle of wine sold in Britain costs \u00a35.01. But Majestic's competitive strength lies in the fact its average selling price is \u00a37.46, making it an important sales channel for producers with more expensive wines to sell.</p> <p>\"If you are the producer of an esoteric, interesting, quirky wine like Gavi di Gavi or Orvieto, and you have a lot of it, we are your go-to retailer,\" said Lewis.</p> <p>Lewis's comments came as Majestic reported a 4% rise in profits to \u00a39.2m for the six months to the end of September as a surge in online orders helped counteract disappointing summer trade. Like-for-likes rose by just 0.6% as wet weather saw a large number of outdoor events cancelled and cases of wine ordered by enthusiastic organisers returned to its stores. \"I measure summers by how many barbecues there are in the Lewis household and we had one in April and one in September,\" said Lewis. \"It rained and rained so customers never got into the habit of sitting in the garden sipping wine.\"</p> <p>Current trading has been more encouraging with UK like-for-likes up 1.2% in the last six weeks and Lewis said it was \"optimistic\" as it entered the important Christmas trading period.</p> <p>Three years ago Majestic lowered the minimum purchase from 12 bottles to six to encourage customers to shop with them more frequently and the retailer said the ploy had worked with the number of customers in its database who had purchased in the last 12 months up more than 11% to 594,000. That offer has now been extended to its website, fuelling a 14% rise in internet sales to \u00a312.7m. Group sales were down by \u00a31.8m at \u00a3126m after it retreated from the wholesale drinks market where the profit margins are lower.</p> <p>\"We think the decision to reduce the minimum purchase requirement from 12 bottles to 6 was genius,\" said Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan. \"At a time when the UK consumer is both watching their pennies and prepared to spend on quality product, this move significantly increases Majestic's target market.\"</p>",

But Ocado has raised \u00a335.8m by placing 55.9m shares at 64p, a few pennies above last Friday's market price. The new cash has allowed the \u00a3100m borrowing facility with Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds to be extended by 18 months. The net result is that management has financial room to breathe. The share price rose by almost a quarter, which counts as a painful one-day roasting for the shorters. Medium-term doubts about Ocado won't be dispelled so easily, of course. Big boys like Sainsbury's have improved their online offers and some analysts query whether Ocado's model of operating from huge distribution centres (the second opens early next year) will ever deliver an acceptable return on capital. After all, in a decade in existence, Ocado has yet to record a hard bottom-line profit. But there's a price for everything. While the flotation at 180p in 2010 was clearly grossly overpriced (as argued here at the time), buying at 64p today is a different risk versus reward proposition, especially for large and long-standing shareholders. It would be illogical for them to them to risk the whole Ocado experiment for the sake of \u00a336m, or a 9.9% increase in the equity base. That's because this time next year we should have a clearer idea of the real level of demand for Ocado's services. The company has grumbled for ages that it has been banging up against capacity constraints at its first distribution centre in Hatfield in Hertfordshire (meeting about 140,000 orders a week currently). When the new facility in Dordon in Warwickshire opens next February, we will discover whether there really is another, say, 100,000 orders to be satisfied weekly. If the answer is \"yes\" (and it might be since Ocado's share of the grocery market would still be less than 1%) there will still be huge questions to be answered about sustainable profit margins, over-specification, the long-term future of the contract with Waitrose and the like. And the Dordon facility also has to work without the IT hitches that have sometimes infected Hatfield. But post-Dordon is the time to judge Ocado's prospects. If real profits don't arrive when annual sales have passed \u00a31bn, the online-only grocery adventure is a failure. But we're not there yet, and the past quarter's sales figures are solid and Dordon is on-budget so far. The short-sellers got their timing wrong.",

      "bodyText": "Rumours, hearsay and a dreadfully poor time on the FTSE last week, has seen the leading index close up an impressive 132 points, 2.4%, at 5738. Not the most impressive list of reasons for the rise, investors appear to be after a bargain, while talk of the fiscal cliff being fixed in the US over the weekend has yet to be shot down. The final reason for the jump appears to come from Europe with the rumours of \"will they, won't they\" solve the problems in Greece a meeting in Brussels tomorrow, finished the day leaning towards a possible solution. According to Reuters, eurozone finance ministers will give a \"tentative go-ahead\" on Greece's aid disbursement. Analyst David Madden, at IG Markets explained: After last week's bloodbath equities are stronger for a variety of reasons: short covering, high hopes for Greek aid and optimism surrounding the fiscal cliff. On Friday the FTSE was near a four-month low, but a combination of short covering and bargain hunters has brought the market back from below the 5600 level.

Democrats and Republicans have said they are going to put their differences aside to work on a package to avoid falling off the fiscal cliff, but outside of increasing the debt ceiling I don't know how they are going to do it. So, not entirely positive. In companies news, the day finished much how it started, with Barlcays leading the way, closing up 15.6p, 6.6%, at 249.8p, after Goldman Sachs wrote a positive note, creating the expected effect. A hodgepodge of miners, computer chip makers, oil companies and a retailer made up the other biggest risers. At the other end, only four of the FTSE 100 companies lost value. Melrose, the engineering turnround specialist, was down 2p at 210p, suffering the aftershocks of its profit warning on Friday. G4S dropped 1.7p to 241.7p as Credit Suisse cut its rating on the company following UK prison contract losses. While Pennon Group, down 1.5p at 596.3p and Shire, down 2p at \u00a317.24 were the other only fallers of the day. Not much corporate news tomorrow, but keep an eye out for EasyJet which recently won its first landing slot to fly to Moscow.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time to wrap things up ahead of tomorrow's Big Day. Here's a closing summary: \u2022 Eurozone finance ministers are reportedly ready to give a 'tentative agreement' to advance Greece its next aid tranche, when they meet in Brussels on Tuesday. According to Reuters, the Eurogroup will decide tomorrow to advance Greece its next loan \u2013 worth up to \u20ac44bn \u2013 if it can persuade them that it has met all its demands. Athens and the EC may also sign a new Memorandum of Understanding (see 3.50pm). \u2022 News of the plan send shares and the euro rallying, with European markets enjoying their biggest rise in nearly two and a half-months (see 4.52pm). \u2022 The report came after the German and Dutch finance ministry's argued that a 'final deal' on Greece could not be hammered out on Tuesday, partly because national parliaments must have their say. \u2022 In Greece, the government used 'decrees' to implement new 'reforms' dictated by its Troika of lenders - including automatic cuts on under-performing parts of the public sector. It was also denounced by opposition leader Alexis Tsipras for turning the country into a 'debt colony' (see 3.28pm). \u2022 There were also mass protests at municipal buildings across Greece, with at least 200 taken over by local government workers angry at plans to impose job cuts (see 1.30pm for details and photos). \u2022 Europe also dominated the UK political landscape. David Cameron insisted that he was being a 'good European' by fighting plans to raise the EU budget, while opposition leader Ed Miliband said it would be a huge mistake for Britain to leave the EU (see 11.23am onwards). I'll be back tomorrow to track the Eurogroup meeting in Brussels. Until then, thanks and goodnight! European stock markets have closed with hefty gains across the board, following the report that Eurogroup leaders will agree tomorrow to pay Greece its next aid tranche on 5 December (see 3.50pm onwards). It's the biggest rally in 10 weeks. Here are the closing prices: FTSE 100: up 132 points at 5737, + 2.36% German DAX: up 173 points at 7124, + 2.5% French CAC: up 100 points at 3442, +3% Spanish IBEX: up 175 points at 7763, + 2.3% Italian FTSE MIB: up 453 points at 15308, + 3% David Madden, market analyst at IG, said traders have welcomed the news that Greece would get its next aid payment: Members of the Troika will argue among themselves about the terms of the deal for Greece, but when push comes to shove Athens will be given the money. It's hardly a monetary union if one member is allowed to go bust. A couple of interesting Italian developments to flag up today - both regarding the country's technocratic prime minister, Mario Monti. Monti is in the Middle East today, sealing a \u20ac1bn deal under which firms in Qatar could invest in Italy. During the trip he gave an interview to al-Jazeera English in which he insisted that Italy was safe from the risk of a bailout. Monti said: I believe this is definitely the case. In the Eurozone of course we are all linked to each other, so we will never be, I mean not even the most powerful and financially solid countries will ever be totally sure that nothing will happen, but yes. He added that everyone should \"please relax\" about the implications of next year's elections, insisting that the reform programme he has begun would continue regardless of who succeeded him.... ...but could Monti himself remain leader? There were reports in Italy today that the country's centrist parties could run on a pro-reform platform, providing a mandate for the former European commissioner to keep his job as PM after the election. A survey last Friday found that Monti's public support had halved to 36% since he replaced Silvio Berlusconi. However, he still commands more support than many elected politicians. The latest polling data shows that the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) is leading the polls. PD has supported Monti's administration since he took over in November 2011. Political analyst Alberto Nardelli, who watches the situation in Italy closely, explains that the public want an elected government but still broadly support Monti, so the key will be \"electoral reform\". The news that Eurogroup ministers are likely to reach a 'tentative deal' on Greece (see 3.50pm) has sent stocks and the European single currency rallying. The euro has rallied by 0.7 of a cent against the US dollar to $1.281, its highest level in two weeks. Europe's stock markets are also romping ahead, with the FTSE 100 now up 116 points, or 2%. Other markets are posting similar gains. Quite a strong reaction, given that the 'tentative' deal isn't exactly the full, final agreement that the IMF has been demanding. And simply lending Greece more money doesn't do anything, by itself, to bring its debts into a sustainable path - as one trader swiftly pointed out: The other burning question, though, is whether the IMF would agree. As reported this morning (see 8.56am), Christine Lagarde has insisted she won't accept another temporary fix on Greece. Just in -- Reuters is now reporting that Eurozone finance ministers will give a \"tentative go-ahead\" on Greece's aid disbursement tomorrow, when they meet in Brussels. However, the money wouldn't actually be handed over until December 5 \u2013 and only then once Athens has confirmed that it has met all outstanding bailout conditions. That suggests that tomorrow's eurogroup meeting will deliver a 'political endorsement in principle' on giving Greece its outstanding aid tranche - which could be worth \u20ac44bn. However the 'finally final' decision to hand over the money wouldn't actually be taken until 3 December. Here's the details, hot from the terminal: Once ministers have given their political endorsement, proposals on how to cut Greek debt and provide additional financing can be sent to national parliaments for approval, a step that is expected to be completed by Nov. 30. This will give Athens time to complete the few outstanding \"prior actions\". International lenders will check if the remaining reforms are in place on Nov. 28 and euro zone finance ministers will make the final decision to pay the next tranche to Athens on Dec. 3, according to the schedule seen by Reuters. So we might get an agreement tomorrow, but not the final deal. Elsewhere in Greece, opposition leader Alexis Tsipras has lambasted prime minister Samaras for helping to turn the country into a \"debt colony\". The Syriza leader was in typical form at a news conference, saying: At tomorrow's Eurogroup meeting, a voiceless, surrendered government will go cap in hand to await what others will decide for it. Tsipras does have a point \u2013 Greece has made all the concessions and tough decisions demanded by its international lenders, and must now wait while the interminable argument over debt sustainability rumbles on. Earlier today, Athens used \"government decrees\" to bring in new rules that ensure that proceeds from privatisation go into a special escrow account, and to impose automatic cuts on public sector units that miss budget targets. There was one piece of good news for Greece this morning - it posted a current account surplus in September for the third month running. The surplus of \u20ac775m, compared with a deficit of \u20ac1.069bn a year earlier, was partly due to a rise in tourism revenues which helped to cut its trade deficit. More speculation this afternoon that the Greek cabinet could soon be reshuffled. The latest word, though, is that Yannis Stournaras will keep the finance ministry brief. Reuters reports that Antonis Samaras, Greece's prime minister, will hold separate meetings with his two coalition partners, Socialist PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos and Democratic Left chief Fotis Kouvelis, this evening to discuss cabinet changes: \"The reshuffle will take place after the instalment,\" said one government official on condition of anonymity. \"The finance minister will not be moved.\" Germany's deputy finance minister has also suggested that finance ministers may not reach an agreement on Greece tomorrow. Speaking a few minutes ago,, Steffen Kampeter said: If there is no decision tomorrow evening (on Greece), then it will come later. If it is possible we will make a decision this week. Hopes of a major breakthrough over Greece at tomorrow's Eurogroup meeting are fading (if they were ever there..) Germany's finance ministry has warned that it does not expect a final decision on Greece's aid programme at Tuesday's gathering in Brussels. It also reiterated its firm opposition to the idea of taking any losses on its Greek bonds \u2013 despite pressure from the IMF for a decisive breakthrough (see 8.56am) Finance ministry spokeswoman Marianne Kothe told reporters in Berlin: A final decision cannot happen tomorrow for purely technical and procedural reasons. For that, the Bundestag has to be involved.... We are working intensively to find a common line. The Dutch finance ministry has also dampened the mood, saying it doesn't expect a definitive agreement. And City analysts also predict little progress tomorrow towards the weighty task of agreeing how to finance Greece for another two years and make its debt levels sustainable to all parties. Elisabeth Afseth of Investec predicted: My guess is there will be further supportive statements but that they are not quite there \u2013 after last week\u2019s Greek bill auction they have another 3 weeks or so before the next big redemption\u2026 Here's a photo showing how Athens University has also been taken over as part of today's protests against job cuts (see also 1.30pm). In Greece, local government workers have launched a mass takeover of government buildings today, in protest at a wave of dismissals dictated by the debt-stricken country\u2019s troika of creditors. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Enraged by the demand that local authorities produce lists of employees eligible for the axe, municipal workers have occupied at least 200 buildings across the country with sit-ins at town halls, rubbish dumpster venues and even kindergartens, bringing city services to a grinding halt. Unravelling a giant banner emblazoned with the word \u201coccupation\u201d across the fa\u00e7ade of Athens\u2019 town hall building this morning, employees vowed to step up protests against international demands that some 2,000 government workers be named with a view to dismissal by the end of the year. Mayors had been given until today to produce the list but with rare exception almost none h honoured the deadline. \u201cThere is no bigger injustice than showing the door to a worker,\u201d said Yiannis Sgouros, regional governor of the greater Athens area, Attica, highlighting the intensity of the opposition. With the takeovers spreading at an alarming rate, the standoff is set to become a major challenge for prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s fragile conservative-dominated coalition. Streamlining the bloated public sector is a central tenet of the latest bailout accord Greece has signed with lenders and if local authorities continue to refuse to submit to the redundancy demands, the administrative reform ministry has said it will resort to using a 2010 census of civil servants to achieve the sackings. Meanwhile in Greece\u2019s northern capital, Thessaloniki, Helena adds that municipal workers have also amassed outside the local courthouse to denounce the trial of three municipal employees accused of assaulting the German consul last week. Protesters are demanding that the three workers, who participated in demonstrations that saw coffee, water and even eggs being hurled at the diplomat, be found innocent by judges overseeing the hearing which began at noon local time. Back over at the CBI conference, Labour leader Ed Miliband has criticised calls for Britain to leave the European Union, and vowed to stop the UK \"sleepwalking\" towards an exit. Miliband is telling an audience of business leaders that here is an \"economic, political and strategic case\" for staying in the EU - citing the single market and Britain's strong trade links. He also reminded the CBI of the conflict and turmoil from which the EU was born: Not everyone's convinced, though, by the argument that Britain needs Europe to help fight her corner: My colleague Andrew Sparrow continues to cover all the details of the CBI bash in Politics Live. Germany's central bank has warned that economic growth in Europe's largest economy is weakening, due to the eurozone crisis and problems across the world economy. In a new monthly report, the Bundesbank said that German firms are more worried about Germany's future prospects. It points to the slowdown in China, Japan's now-shrinking economy, and fears over the US fiscal cliff. The full report is online here (pdf, in German), and Reuters provides a translation of the key points: The economy currently presents a mixed picture, which is likely to cool further towards year-end... By now it has become unmistakable that the disturbing external factors are affecting the willingness to invest and job planning so strongly that the whole economy could be affected. Last week's economic data showed that German GDP rose by 0.2% in the third quarter of 2012 \u2013 the question is whether it shrinks in the last three months... More on the looming EU budget row -- our political editor Patrick Wintour reports that David Cameron was lobbying other EU leaders over the weekend: Meanwhile, the German finance ministry has been briefing that a decision on the budget could be delayed - perhaps until next year... Prime minister David Cameron has warned that Britain is now in \"the economic equivalent of war today\", in a speech to the CBI conference. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has been live-blogging the event on our Politics Live blog - where you can follow the speech highlights live. Cameron was also quizzed over the UK's approach to Europe ahead of a summit on the EU budget which begins on Thursday. Amusingly, the first question came from a gentleman from the German Embassy: Cameron insisted that his opposition to a real-terms increase in the EU budget did not make him a 'bad European', saying it wasn't realistic to spend more on Europe while cutting at home. The row over the EU budget is picking up pace, though \u2013 the FT reckons that Brussels officials are now considering if they could devise a budget deal without Britain. And overshadowing everything is the question of an in-out referendum in the UK. The CBI's Roger Carr discussed this issue in his own speech this morning, insisting that Britain would be wrong to quit the EU, as the cold business logic of partnership for self-interest must prevail. The Wall Street Journal has a very good feature today about how Greece's economy is now in reverse, with many professional people returning to the rural life which their families left a few decades ago. For Greeks, Crisis Reverses a Generation of Progress (\u00a3) It explains how Greece's long, relentless economic decline is far more than a simple recession, with the country's middle class now in a desperate, unexpected, battle to survive. One person interviewed, a former Athens graphic designer, is now living back with his mother in the country raising chickens, harvesting olives and sleeping in the bed he was born in. Another couple have seen their lifestyle completely unravel in under two years: For Dimitris Stathis and Aggeliki Katsimardou, the speed of descent has been stunning. Ms. Katsimardou was laid off from her job as an insurance underwriter in early 2010. Around Easter time of this year, her husband lost his merchandising job with an international oil company, and the company car that came with it. Now Mr. Stathis pumps gas at a filling station. He earns \u20ac800 a month, about half his previous pay. Yet they owe the bank \u20ac900 a month for their mortgage. \"We can't afford meat,\" Ms. Katsimardou said. \"Even milk is difficult. Or yogurt. And this is Greece, for God's sake.\" Austria's finance minister, Maria Fekter, is taking her traditional hard line in Greece ahead of tomorrow's eurogroup meeting -- saying that Athens' debt pile cannot be cut again. Fab Goria of Linkiesta has the details: UPDATE: Here's the full quote, delivered in Vienna: We have made it very clear that Greece cannot expect any extra money from us, nor any public debt haircut European stock markets have posted decent gains in morning trading \u2013 apparently driven by optimism of a deal over the US fiscal cliff rather than progress on the eurocrisis. FTSE 100: up 55 points at 5661, +1% German DAX: up 88 points at 7038, + 1.27% French CAC: up 41 points at 3382, +1.24% Spain's IBEX: up 48 points at 7636, +0.6% Italy's FTSE MIB: up 176 points at 15032. +1.2% That's a much cheerier picture than the one that greeted Chinese investors at one point today, where the Shanghai Composite Index briefly dropped below the 2,000 point mark for the first time since 2009. Anti-austerity protests continued over the weekend, with tens of thousands of Spanish doctors, nurses and hospital staff marching through Madrid on Sunday. The demonstration was an attack on budget cuts and privatisations, with protesters chanting slogans including: \"Health is a right. We are going to fight.\" Medical staff told AFP that recent spending cuts had hit the quality of medical care, with patients also being asked to pay more towards their own prescriptions. Here are some photos from the scene: Further protests are due soon. Organisers of the rally said Madrid's regional health workers will hold four days of strikes - on 26 and 27 November and 4 and 5 December. Bad economic news from Italy just hit the wires \u2013 industrial orders tumbled by 4.0% in September compared with the previous month, and were a startling 12.8% lower than a year ago. That suggests Europe's third-largest economy is continuing to suffer from the eurocrisis and the general weakness of the world economy. Data from ISTAT showed that a slump in overseas orders was to blame \u2013 they fell by 7.4% month-on-month. The toxic debts within Spain's financial sector continue to grow. Data just released by the Bank of Spain shows that 10.7% of loans were in arrears in September, up from August's 10.5% to a new record high. That means there are now \u20ac182bn of non-performing loans across Spain's troubled banking sector. National parliaments will probably have to give their agreement to any deal agreed by the IMF and the Eurogroup tomorrow over Greece. That means that Athens probably won't get a final decision on its aid package until the end of November. In the meantime, Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports that the Greek government is cracking on with implementing its side of the bailout programme: [Antonis] Samaras wants his ministers to proceed with the \u201cprior actions\u201d demanded by the troika, including an overhaul of the tax system, the creation of a committee to oversee the budget execution and the acceleration of privatizations. The Athens rumour mill continues to predict a government reshuffle soon: Samaras is said to be keen to draw in new ministers from his junior partners, PASOK and Democratic Left, in order to bolster a sense of coalition unity and ward off the specter of snap elections next spring. Christine Lagarde issued a blunt warning to EU leaders not to indulge in fantasies over Greece, as she headed back from Asia over the weekend to attend tomorrow's Eurogroup meeting. The head of the International Monetary Fund insisted that the eurozone must agree a permanent deal on what to do about its weakest member. Lagarde told Reuters that: I am always trying to be constructive but I am driven by two objectives...to build and approve a program for Greece that is solid, that is convincing today, that will be sustainable tomorrow, that is rooted in reality and not in wishful thinking. That suggests the IMF is sticking to its guns that austerity has caused greater damage to long-term growth than the EU's own calculations (the crux of the argument over Greece). Lagarde added that: The second objective is to maintain the integrity, credibility and quality of advice that we are giving, not for the Fund itself, which obviously is a concern of mine, but to lend that to the Europeans because that is what they are interested in. In other words, the IMF isn't prepared to be involved with a Greek aid package that is simply unconvincing. That suggests she may not be impressed by J\u00f6rg Asmussen's suggestion of a 'holding deal' that would mean a third programme for Greece in future (see 8.37am) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. Tension is building today ahead of another crucial meeting on Greece. On Tuesday, eurozone finance ministers and IMF officials will meet for another attempt at agreeing a deal on Greece's aid programme. To succeed, the EU and the IMF must bridge their differences over how to bring Greece's debts back to a manageable level \u2013 a task they flunked last week. Ahead of the talks, J\u00f6rg Asmussen \u2013 Germany's man on the European Central Bank's governing council \u2013 has weighed in by declaring that a new deal will be needed for Greece after 2014. In what looks like an attempt to hoof the Greek debt can further down the road, Asmussen said that the eurozone should agree the details of two years of funding for Greece at tomorrow's meeting and leave further help to be decided later. Asmussen told German broadcaster ZDF that: We should next week settle the financing for the years 2013 and 2014, but you have to be honest and say we do not really expect the country to have access to markets in 2015 and 2016; that means a follow-up programme would be necessary. That would delay the issue of Greece's long-term debt sustainability until after next autumn's German general election \u2013 but is not compatible with the International Monetary Fund's view (last week, Christine Lagarde demanded \"a 'real fix not a quick fix\"). But without any fix, Greece won't get its next aid tranche - which could now be worth \u20ac44bn. Klaus Regling, who runs Europe's main bailout fund, has also weighed in today. He told German newspaper Handelsblatt that it was almost inconceivable for European governments to take losses on their Greek bonds. Regling said: A public sector debt writedown is something very rare that can only be done in extreme circumstances. adding that official creditors had already done their bit by offering Greece fresh credit on generous terms. One might wonder what circumstances Regling would view as 'extreme' - given Greece's national debt could hit 190% of GDP next year. But his comments show that European officials are still unwilling to confront the idea that the ECB and national governments must take losses on their Greek bonds. So... we'll be monitoring all the developments and jockeying for position ahead of tomorrow's eurogroup meeting in Brussels, along with other key events across the global economy.",

Athens and the EC may also sign a new Memorandum of Understanding (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/19/eurozone-crisis-greece-aid-programme-imf#block-50aa5539b579af80725e3dc7\">see 3.50pm</a>).</p> <p>\u2022 News of the plan send shares and the euro rallying, with European markets enjoying their biggest rise in nearly two and a half-months (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/19/eurozone-crisis-greece-aid-programme-imf#block-50aa63cc95cb1a2f3966802b\">see 4.52pm</a>).</p> <p>\u2022 The report came after the German and Dutch finance ministry's argued that a 'final deal' on Greece could not be hammered out on Tuesday, partly because national parliaments must have their say.</p> <p>\u2022 In Greece, the government used 'decrees' to implement new 'reforms' dictated by its Troika of lenders - including automatic cuts on under-performing parts of the public sector. It was also denounced by opposition leader Alexis Tsipras for turning the country into a 'debt colony' (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/19/eurozone-crisis-greece-aid-programme-imf#block-50aa501b95cbf3a893f3325f\">see 3.28pm</a>).</p> <p>\u2022 There were also mass protests at municipal buildings across Greece, with at least 200 taken over by local government workers angry at plans to impose job cuts (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/19/eurozone-crisis-greece-aid-programme-imf#block-50aa324795cbf3a893f33240\">see 1.30pm for details and photos</a>).</p> <p>\u2022 Europe also dominated the UK political landscape.

To succeed, the EU and the IMF must bridge their differences over how to bring Greece's debts back to a manageable level \u2013 a task they flunked last week.</p> <p>Ahead of the talks, <strong>J\u00f6rg Asmussen</strong> \u2013 Germany's man on the European Central Bank's governing council \u2013 has weighed in by declaring that a new deal will be needed for Greece after 2014.</p> <p>In what looks like an attempt to hoof the Greek debt can further down the road, Asmussen said that the eurozone should agree the details of two years of funding for Greece at tomorrow's meeting and leave further help to be decided later.</p> <p>Asmussen told German broadcaster ZDF that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We should next week settle the financing for the years 2013 and 2014, but you have to be honest and say we do not really expect the country to have access to markets in 2015 and 2016; that means a follow-up programme would be necessary.</p> </blockquote> <p>That would delay the issue of Greece's long-term debt sustainability until after next autumn's German general election \u2013 but is <strong>not </strong>compatible with the International Monetary Fund's view (last week, Christine Lagarde demanded \"a 'real fix not a quick fix\").</p> <p>But without any fix, Greece won't get its next aid tranche - which could now be worth \u20ac44bn.</p> <p><strong>Klaus Regling</strong>, who runs Europe's main bailout fund, has also weighed in today. He told German newspaper Handelsblatt that it was almost inconceivable for European governments to take losses on their Greek bonds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/griechenland-rettung-esm-chef-regling-lehnt-schuldenschnitt-fuer-athen-ab/7406694.html\">Regling said:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A public sector debt writedown is something very rare that can only be done in extreme circumstances.</p> </blockquote> <p>adding that official creditors had already done their bit by offering Greece fresh credit on generous terms.</p> <p>One might wonder what circumstances Regling would view as 'extreme' - given Greece's national debt could hit 190% of GDP next year. But his comments show that European officials are still unwilling to confront the idea that the ECB and national governments must take losses on their Greek bonds.</p> <p>So... we'll be monitoring all the developments and jockeying for position ahead of tomorrow's eurogroup meeting in Brussels, along with other key events across the global economy.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-19T11:56:52.333Z\">at 11.56am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Lamprell has revealed its fifth, and by far its worst, profit warning this year, admitting its full-year losses will be seven times bigger that first feared. The oil rig maker said it will make a loss of $105m (it previously thought the loss would be $12m) and discussions are ongoing with its lenders to avoid breaking its covenants by the end of the year. A loss of $25m will be made on its Caspian Sea jack-up project and a windfarm project is way over budget and facing penalties for being late. Yet despite such doom and gloom, shares in the company are up 10.8p, 15.5%, at 80p, in a perfect example of investors preferring to know the true extent of a company's problems, rather than being left with the uncertainty of vague statements that have been made in the past. The reason for such a huge increase in the company's expected loss comes courtesy of an independent report from PwC to audit the accounts. The report revealed problems far wilder than the incompetent board managed to unveil. At the fourth profit warning last month the company's chief executive and two senior managers resigned over the fiasco, while a new chairman (who ordered the PwC review) was appointed in the summer.

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 is edging up this morning, rising 57 points, 1%, to 5662. Positive news from the US on Friday over the start of all-important fiscal cliff negotiations gave a welcome boost to the usual suspects of the big mining companies. However, with nothing more than good vibes coming from negotiations, expect those same companies to fall just as easily. As it is ENRC is up 9.3p, 3.6%, at 268.7p; Randgold Resources up 175p, 2.8%, at \u00a365.25; Evraz up 5.5p, 2.5%, at 224.1p and Fresnillo up 43p, 2.3% at \u00a319.20. Wall Street rose on Friday after positive signals from the federal government on the debate over the US fiscal cliff. Leaders of the Senate and House indicated they would be flexible in efforts to settle policy differences after a meeting at the White House. Over the weekend President Obama was equally positive. Topping the biggest risers on the FTSE is Barclays after Goldman Sachs analysts upgraded its target price from 225p a share to 320p. Well on its way, shares are up 3.8% at 243.1p. But turning to the mid cap companies provides for far more interesting reading, as food delivery business Ocado heads the biggest risers, up a staggering 24.4%, up 14.8p to 75.1p. The company is still a long, long way off its listing price of 180p, but a placing of new shares at 64p to raise \u00a335.8m appears successful, meaning it won't run out of money or breach its banking covenants. The boost to the share price will also give a bloody nose to several traders who have been betting against the company with short positions.

Elsewhere, South African mining firm Lonmin, holds a general meeting of shareholders today in the hope they will approve a rights issue to raise funds for the business which has been badly damaged from the mining strikes which left several workers dead. Biggest shareholder, Xstrata, with 25% (and facing its own shareholder issues over its merger with Glencore) has said it will vote in favour of the rights issue but only if there is a substantial clean up of the board.

      "bodyText": "Many supermarket multibuy deals that promise savings on items such as pizzas, yoghurts, crisps and baby goods can leave shoppers worse off, according to a year-long investigation by Which? into \"misleading\" pricing tactics by the major chains. In the worst cases, Which? found that supermarkets doubled the shelf price of an item when they began promoting it as a money-saving multibuy. It found that Asda was selling a Goodfella's Deep Pan Pepperoni pizza at a standard price of about \u00a31, but when it went on to a multibuy deal, the price jumped to \u00a32.50 for one or \u00a34.50 for two. Around one in 10 products on supermarket shelves increased in price when they went from the previous standard price to the new multibuy price, then decreased again when the promotion ended. Which? also found that some products were almost permanently on discount or multibuy. It cited a Nestl\u00e9 yoghurt, Munch Bunch, which was typically on sale for \u00a31 for a pack of four at Tesco and Sainsbury's. But when it went on multibuy, the price was \u00a32 for two packs, or \u00a31.40 to \u00a31.59 for one pack. \"So whenever you buy, the product nearly always costs \u00a31,\" said Which?. At Asda, a 200ml bottle of Ambre Solaire sun protection cream was usually on sale for \u00a35 when not on multibuy, but then \u00a37 for one or \u00a310 for two when promoted as a multibuy. \"Generally, it was the same price whether on offer or not,\" said Which?. Waitrose also fell foul of the price-checking exercise. Over a period of four months, it sold six-packs of McCoy's crisps on a multibuy of \u00a32.50 for two, or at a discount price of either \u00a31 or \u00a31.26. Asda told Which?: \"Customers tell us they want low prices, not a strategy that gives with one hand and takes with the other. We're making sure the cost of the weekly shop is consistently low, with no surprises.\" A spokeswoman for Sainsbury's said: \"Our stores have around 30,000 products and Which? has cited just one example. We run a wide variety of promotions to meet our customers' needs and we always clearly display the standard price with multibuys to help prevent any confusion.\" Tesco declined to comment on the specific findings of the investigation but issued a statement saying that its multibuys offered good value for money. Some of the deals found during the investigation were \"plain daft\", said the consumer group. \"We went around supermarkets and found packets of sweets that were 34p each or four for \u00a33,\" said Which?. The Guardian's Saturday Money section has in recent months featured dozens of \"daft deals\" submitted by shoppers in which the multibuy is pricier than buying the items individually. Multibuy deals have become a staple of supermarket promotions in recent years, and now apply to nearly half the goods on offer in a supermarket at any one time. Which? said that of the 115 products that it examined in the first half of this year, 46% of the time they were on multibuy, compared with 35% of the time in the first half of 2011. But there are signs that consumers have become increasingly disillusioned by the value on offer in supermarket promotions. Seven out of 10 people told Which? that they prefer straightforward discounts to multibuy offers. The Office of Fair Trading said it could not comment on individual supermarket prices, but that its research had found most shoppers automatically assumed multibuy offers were cheaper than buying individually, and that 37% did not work out if they were actually making a saving when they bought the item. The shadow consumer minister, Ian Murray, said: \"Consumers in the UK deserve complete clarity on best buys and discounts from our major supermarket retailers, particularly due to the fact the pay packets aren't stretching as far as they previously did, so every penny counts. \"There is a strong case to be made that the government should look into this area now the evidence of Which? has come to light. While competition among supermarkets is good for consumers, and indeed they make a major contribution to our economy, there is a risk that people, particularly families who may be reliant on these sorts of multibuys, are being ripped off.\" Which? said existing rules were supposed to make sure that supermarket special offers did not mislead shoppers, but it felt they left too many loopholes and would call for the government to improve consumer protection.",
