      "bodyText": "In March, State Street Global Advisors unveiled Fearless Girl, a statue of a young girl confronting the charging Wall Street bull. It became an instant cultural touchstone. But as selfies with Fearless Girl shot across social media, State Street, one of America\u2019s leading money managers, was quietly and consistently voting down gender equality proposals at some of the country\u2019s largest corporations. On a shareholder proposal calling for Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, to disclose any pay disparities between men and women, State Street voted no. On the same proposal before Wells Fargo, State Street voted no. According to SEC records seen by the Guardian, in 2017 alone State Street rejected shareholder proposals to tackle gender inequality at least a dozen times \u2013 including at Aetna, American Express, Bank of America, Express Scripts, JP Morgan Chase and MasterCard. The news comes as the money manager, which has $2.6tn in assets under management, has agreed to pay $5m to settle claims that it underpaid hundreds of its female employees. State Street was also casting its votes at the same time it was trumpeting its efforts to help diversify the male-dominated world of corporate governance. The firm says it has voted against reinstating hundreds of board chairs at firms where the board is entirely men. But while State Street may be pressuring companies to diversify at the top, it isn\u2019t wielding its influence to promote gender equality for the workforce. \u201cYou would have thought they would, if you\u2019re going to so publicly announce \u2018this is our position,\u2019\u201d said Peter Henning, a professor of law at Wayne State University. \u201cBut no one\u2019s watching.\u201d Fearless Girl was an instant, viral success. Within a few weeks of her debut on International Women\u2019s Day, she had starred in nearly a quarter-million Instagram posts. The promotion would go on to generate an estimated $7.4m in free marketing for State Street. Some of State Street\u2019s no votes on gender equality measures involved its She Fund \u2013 a multimillion dollar index fund created to advance gender diversity in business leadership. A share of its revenues go towards charities that \u201cempower girls to become future business leaders\u201d, State Street says. Fearless Girl started life as a She Fund advertisement. When the statue was installed, a plaque at her feet read: \u201cKnow the power of women in leadership. She makes a difference.\u201d State Street voted She Fund\u2019s shares against gender pay gap proposals for American Express, Mastercard, and Aetna, according to a document State Street prepared for the SEC. As with the other proposals, these called for the companies to produce a report about whether men and women in their workforces are paid equally. Major institutional investors like State Street rarely support shareholder resolutions they see as dealing with \u201csocial issues\u201d, such as gender and racial equality and climate change. The proposals typically originate with small investors and rarely pass. But shareholder resolutions have become a powerful way to compel companies to reveal more about gender equality among their employees. Arjuna Capital, which introduced many of the gender pay gap resolutions on which State Street voted no, has used the prospect of similar proposals to get companies like Nike and Starbucks to disclose and close their gender pay gaps. Just because these proposals rarely pass, said Ric Marshall, who specializes in corporate governance research, doesn\u2019t mean State Street\u2019s vote doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cTheir job is to vote on the issues that are on the agenda,\u201d said Marshall, an executive director at MSCI ESG Research. \u201cThey cast a vote, they have to stand by it, one way or the other.\u201d Occasionally, a gender equality measure nearly passes. That was the case with a 2016 proposal for eBay to disclose its goals and methods for reducing the gender pay gap. A major investor advisory group encouraged a yes vote, saying: \u201ceBay lags its peers in addressing gender pay disparity at its company.\u201d Investors voted \u201cyes\u201d in extraordinary numbers. But not State Street. Ebay urged investors to oppose the measure. State Street did so. Using data from the firm Fund Votes, Bloomberg found that State Street supported gender proposals in just two instances in 2017 \u2013 pay gap proposals before Facebook and Alphabet. It voted against gender pay gap proposals before both companies on other occasions. State Street did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its voluminous guidelines for proxy voting, State Street addresses \u201cenvironmental and social issues\u201d. Although the section is comparatively short, it reads, in part: \u201cWe consider the financial and economic implications of environmental and social issues first and foremost. Environmental and social factors not only can have an impact on the reputation of companies; they may also represent significant operational risks and costs to business\u2026 \u201cIn their public reporting, we expect companies to disclose information on relevant management tools and material environmental and social performance metrics.\u201d In an email to Bloomberg News, Rakhi Kumar, head of asset stewardship at State Street, said: \u201cWe are taking into account how the organization is holistically approaching diversity based on a number of factors that go well beyond just gender or pay.\u201d Some proposals, she said, were \u201ctoo limited in scope, which can in turn limit their effectiveness\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2017 because an earlier version referred to Rakhi Kumar as \u201che\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "US escalates trade dispute with UK and Canada over Bombardier", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US has escalated its trade dispute with Britain and Canada by announcing plans to slap a further 80% duty on the export of planes built by Bombardier. The move follows complaints by Boeing that Canadian-owned Bombardier, which employs more than 4,000 people in Belfast, had dumped its C Series jets at \u201cabsurdly low\u201d prices. Bombardier is facing a planned 220% tariff as part of a separate investigation, the US Department of Commerce confirmed. A second levy of 80% is also being applied to Bombardier\u2019s sales to the US after a preliminary finding that the jets were sold below cost price to Delta Air Lines in 2016. Boeing claimed that 75 aircraft were sold at nearly \u00a310.6m below cost price. Bombardier dismissed the claim as \u201cabsurd\u201d. The company is due to begin delivering a blockbuster order for up to 125 new jets to Atlanta-based Delta next year. The US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said: \u201cThe United States is committed to free, fair and reciprocal trade with Canada, but this is not our idea of a properly functioning trading relationship. We will continue to verify the accuracy of this decision, while doing everything in our power to stand up for American companies and their workers.\u201d The US government said its intervention was prompted by concern to prevent \u201cinjurious dumping\u201d of imports into the country, \u201cestablishing an opportunity to compete on a level playing field\u201d. The Department of Commerce said Bombardier had failed to provide the information it had requested. It said: \u201cThe anti-dumping duty law provides US businesses and workers with a transparent, quasi-judicial, and internationally accepted mechanism to seek relief from the market-distorting effects caused by injurious dumping of imports into the United States.\u201d The US government\u2019s preliminary decision affects imports of 100 to 150 aircraft from Canada. The department said it would instruct US Customs and Border Protection to collect cash deposits of duties. The proposed duties would not take effect unless affirmed by the US International Trade Commission (ITC) early next year. To win its case before the ITC, Boeing must prove it was harmed by Bombardier\u2019s sales, despite not using one of its own jets to compete for the Delta order. Bombardier said it was confident that the ITC would find Boeing had not been harmed, calling the Department of Commerce decision a case of \u201cegregious overreach\u201d. Delta said the decision was preliminary and it was confident the ITC \u201cwill conclude that no US manufacturer is at risk\u201d from Bombardier\u2019s plane. Boeing has said the dispute was not an attack on Canada or Britain. The UK prime minister, Theresa May, lobbied the US president, Donald Trump, last month over the dispute sparked by Boeing\u2019s complaints about \u201cunfair\u201d state subsidies from the UK and Canada. She also discussed the issue with her Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau. The UK business secretary, Greg Clark, travelled to Chicago for a meeting with Boeing\u2019s chairman, president and chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, to try to solve the dispute. The decision is expected to heighten trade tensions which flared last week after the US announced a preliminary duty of nearly 220% for subsidies Bombardier received, which was well above the 80% duty Boeing sought in its complaint. Unions have warned that the move could put jobs in jeopardy. In retaliation, Canada and Britain threatened to avoid buying Boeing military equipment, saying the duties on the C Series would reduce US sales. The combined 300% duty would effectively keep the plane out of the market. Bombardier shares dipped 2 cents to C$2.18 (\u00a31.33) immediately after the announcement but have since recovered.",

But with the pound suffering amid the latest political uncertainties in the wake of the Tory party conference, the FTSE 100 managed to edge higher by the end of trading, with its overseas earners benefitting from the prospect of a weaker sterling. A mixed bag for the US, with an unexpected fall in jobs balanced by a rise in wage growth, left Wall Street slipping back from record highs. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 14.88 points or 0.2% at 7522.87 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.09% to 12,955.94 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.36% lower at 5359.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.77% to 22,392.31 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.29% lower at 10,185.5 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.10% to 745.55 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.12%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. A mixture of profit taking and concerns about oversupply have brought a rally in the oil price to an abrupt end. Hopes that producers would extend their agreement to cap output and reduce a supply glut have supported crude prices recently. But they have slipped back after Russia clarified that President Putin had not, as suggested, proposed extending the production cut agreement although he thought it was a possibility. Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister also sounded lukewarm about an extension until the end of 2018, saying he was \u201cflexible\u201d about it. Rising US crude exports have also been taken as a negative factor, along with the re-opening of Libya\u2019s largest oil field. The approach of tropical storm Nate to the US Gulf coast is not helping matters either. So Brent crude is currently down 2.7% at $55.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 3.25% to $49.14. The pound continues to flounder against the dollar, both on worries about the political situation in the UK and of course, the strength of the US currency as the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate rise in December increases. At the moment the pound is down 0.53% at $1.3047, albeit off its worst levels. Connor Campbell. financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Friday\u2019s US non-farm jobs report only made the week worse for cable, despite a rather unpleasant headline figure. The non-farm number itself was as ugly as they come. For the first time in 7 years the reading came in negative, at -33k against the 82k forecast and the (upwards revised) 169k seen in August. Yet while the figure was far worse than expected, it actually wasn\u2019t that surprising given it covered a period impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. Instead of lingering on the shrinking non-farm payrolls, investors\u2019 attention turned to rest of the jobs report. Wage growth jumped significantly month-on-month, from 0.2% to 0.5%, while the unemployment rate hit a fresh 16 year low of 4.2%. It\u2019s not a stretch to see those numbers as tipping the Fed\u2019s dovish/hawkish scales towards the latter, with a December rate hike now coming into sharper focus. The dollar reacted as one would expect, widening its gains against the pound.., while taking 0.1% off the euro and half a percent off the yen... And what of poor, fragile sterling? Well September\u2019s super surge is looking more and more like an anomaly, the Tories once again finding a way to undermine confidence in the currency. Cable\u2019s stuck at a sub-$1.305 one month nadir, while against the euro the pound has cemented a fresh 3 week low after falling half a percent. And the thing is, there is no guarantee that next week will be any better, especially if the weekend papers are as filled with Tory infighting as one would expect. Here\u2019s our report on the US jobs data. Dominic Rushe writes: The US jobs market stalled in September, losing 33,000 jobs, as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma took their toll. It was the first time in seven years that the US monthly total had recorded a fall. The US economy had added an average of 176,000 new jobs a month so far this year but as the labor department had predicted the storms, which caused fatal and catastrophic damage across Texas and Florida, slowed hiring. But a loss in jobs was far worse than the 80,000 new jobs most US economists had expected would be created. It ends the longest stretch of uninterrupted jobs growth in US history. This was the first loss in jobs since September 2010. Ahead of Friday\u2019s jobs report the Bureau of Labor Statistics said some 11.2 million workers lived in the affected areas, about 7.7% of the US workforce. Employment in food services and drinking places declined by 105,000 in September. That sector has added an average of 24,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months. The unemployment rate, which was 4.4% in August, fell to 4.2%, a 16-year low. This is the second month of disappointing growth in the US jobs market. In August the economy added 156,000 new jobs, below the 180,000 that had been expected by economists. The full story is here: After their recent record breaking runs, US markets have paused for breath. Despite the weaker headline jobs figure, the dollar has strengthened on the basis that higher than expected wages growth means the Federal Reserve may well raise interest rates before the end of the year. In turn, that has put a small dampener on equities. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 21 points or 0.09% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% lower and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.25%. And here\u2019s a link to the jobs report data: The dollar has moved higher following the US jobs data, despite a fall in the headline figure. Analysts point to the strong pay growth giving the Federal Reserve leeway to raise rates in December. So sterling has hit a four week low against the dollar, while the US currency was at its strongest level against the euro since mid-August. Against the yen, the greenback hit its highest since mid-July. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: Hurricane disruption dragged payrolls negative, but a big fall in unemployment and significant wage increases make a December rate hike look probable... Despite the softness in payrolls the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.4%. The other big number is the 0.5% month on month jump in wages \u2013 the biggest increase since November 2008 \u2013 which takes the annual wage growth number up to 2.9%. Note that there were also some upward revisions to monthly wage rates so we may finally be seeing some of the strength in jobs feeding through into inflation pressures. Payrolls will bounce back strongly given the Bureau for Labour Statistics suggests that 1.47mn people were unable to get to work because of storm disruption. Moreover, labour demand indicators remain strong in other reports. This positive overall story on the labour market is only going to strengthen the case for higher interest rates. We already know that the growth outlook is strong \u2013 underlined by the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys hitting 13 and 12 year highs respectively this week \u2013 and inflation is heading back towards target \u2013 next week\u2019s headline CPI expected at 2.1% and core at 1.8% year on year. The arguments justifying higher interest rates is also being broadened with Fed Chair Yellen suggesting \u201cpersistently easy monetary policy\u201d could have \u201cadverse implications for financial stability\u201d, while warning of \u201csomewhat rich\u201d asset valuations. Relatively loose financial conditions \u2013 a flat yield curve and dollar weakness - have been used as arguments that could justify action by other Fed officials. It therefore seems that the main risk to our December rate hike call is politics and the potential for an economically and market disruptive government shutdown. However, we remain hopeful that this can be avoided clearing the way for another two rate hikes in 2018. Manuel Ortiz-Olave, market analyst at Monex Europe, said: Headline job creation had a rough time in September. Although a significant slowdown was expected after the summer\u2019s tropical storms, not many forecasts were expecting to see a contraction. The most important surprise, however, comes from a significant increase in wage growth and a new drop in the unemployment rate to fresh 16-year lows. Wage growth has been the last piece of the inflation puzzle for the Federal Reserve over the last several quarters, as it remained stubbornly low despite a strong economic recovery and continued new lows in the unemployment rate. Albeit late, wage growth finally made an appearance in September with a massive increase well above expectations. Despite the contraction in employment, the three-month average of headline job creation remains above 100.000 jobs/month, which will not discourage the Fed from a hike. There can be no more doubt, the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates before year end as already strong data now has the support of the Fed\u2019s \u201cprodigal son\u201d: wage growth. This suggests the economy will grow at a strong pace in the last quarter of the year. Here is a chart showing clearly the impact on leisure and hospitality jobs: And here is the unemployment data and monthly changes: Other key figures from the non-farms report show the overall jobless rate fell unexpectedly to 4.2% from 4.4%. Pay growth was also better-than-expected, picking up to 0.5% in September from 0.2% in August. Economists were predicting a smaller rise to 0.3%. The impact on jobs of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma was far greater than economists had predicted in September. The 33,000 fall in non-farm payrolls was the first drop in seven years after workers were displaced and firms delayed hiring. There was a record drop in employment in the leisure and hospitality sectors. Employment in food services and drinking places fell by 105,000 in September, in an industry where most workers are not paid when absent from work. William Wiatrowski, acting commissioner at the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, provided some context to the figures: In September, a sharp employment decline in food services and drinking places and below-trend growth in some other industries likely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. The storms caused large-scale evacuations and severe damage to many homes and businesses. In the establishment survey, employees who are not paid for the pay period that includes the 12th of the month are not counted as employed. Many employees in areas affected by the hurricanes were likely off payrolls during the reference pay period for September. In September, 1.5 million workers had a job but were not at work for the entire reference week due to bad weather, the highest level for this series over the past 20 years. This series is highly sensitive to the timing of weather events and thus does not capture the immediate effect of all such events on the job market. Payrolls actually fell by 33,000 last month in figures just out, far worse than expected. Economists had predicted 90,000 jobs would be added. Figures for August were revised up to show 169,000 jobs were added (up from a previous estimate of 156,000). More soon... Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, is speaking about trust at the Royal Society of Arts in London. He says that in some ways, loss of trust in institutions is the very definition of a financial crisis, including the most recent one which has been \u201chugely trust-busting\u201d. Even as the scars of this crisis heal, this trust deficit might not repair itself naturally. The trust deficit that those in money and finance face may be not cyclical, not temporary, but structural and permanent. And if that\u2019s true, then those of us within financial services, including central banks, will really have to go some to repair that deficit. US non-farm payrolls for September are coming up at 1.30pm. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting the number of jobs added last month fell sharply to 90,000, from 156,000 in August, largely as a result of hurricane disruption. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has announced it is extending its investigations to other 2 Sisters poultry plants in England and Wales, as well as its scandal-hit West Bromwich chicken processing plant. It follows a Guardian and ITV News investigation that revealed poor hygiene standards and food safety records being altered. The FSA said that while it had not identified food safety issues at West Bromwich, the inspection \u201chighlighted issues requiring management attention, for example in relation to some aspects of staff training and stock control\u201d. Heather Hancock, chairman of the Food Standards Agency, said it was extending its investigation until it is satisfied that there is no risk to public health. Over in Greece pensioners have been protesting outside the country\u2019s highest administrative court against further cuts demanded by international creditors. It is the second such demonstration this week as anger mounts over the spectre of yet more cutbacks next year. Helena Smith reports. Gathering outside the Council of State, pensioners shouted \u201cshame on you\u201d as judges met to consider the legality of pensions being further trimmed back. Since the onset of the crisis in late 2009, pensions have been cut 12 times with unionists claiming some 1.5 million retirees are now living on less than \u20ac500 a month. The latest reforms would mean yet more \u201cdramatic reductions.\u201d Earlier this week pensioners took to the streets in another show of anger, holding large banners deploring the cuts. With unemployment still hovering around 22%, families are often forced to survive on the pensions of elderly members. Greece\u2019s debt crisis has hit retirees harder than perhaps any other age group. An estimated 22.2% of the country\u2019s population is \u201cseverely materially deprived\u201d unable to fend for themselves, or pay basic bills, according to the EU statistics agency, Eurostat. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item forecasting group, has analysed the UK productivity figures and says Brexit negotiations could further hold back progress: There is a risk that prolonged uncertainty may end up weighing down markedly on business investment and damage productivity. Prolonged difficult Brexit negotiations could increase this risk. This could also be compounded if foreign companies markedly reduce their investment in the UK, diluting any beneficial spill-over of skills and knowledge. Read our full story on the figures here: Easyjet is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 with shares down 2.7% this morning. The low cost carrier is down despite flying a record 24.1m passengers in the three months to September. The airline also said in a trading update that it was on track to make annual profits of \u00a3405-\u00a3410m, at the higher end of its guidance but below last year\u2019s \u00a3495m. Investors are also nervous about what the future holds, after chief executive Carolyn McCall said industry conditions remain \u201cchallenging\u201d. The FTSE 100\u2019s worst performer\u2019s this morning: A separate report from the ONS shows that the UK was less productive than the average among the G7 advanced economies in 2016. Output per hour worked in the UK was 15.1% below the average in 2016, compared with 15.5% below in 2015. The UK was however more productive than Canada and Japan: Britain was less productive between April and June compared with the previous quarter, with output per hour worked down 0.1%. It was dragged down by the manufacturing sector, where productivity fell in the second quarter by 1.3% according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile services sector productivity was up 0.2% over the period. Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, said the weak figures do not bode well for UK wages, which are already rising at a slower rate than prices: Poor productivity performance underpins the stagnation of real wages, and presents the government with a particular challenge since it appears likely that previous forecasts of earnings, and hence also of tax revenues, have been overoptimistic. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, has this take on developments in Spain and the implications for markets: The IBEX has been hit by profit taking as yesterday\u2019s impressive bounce back was short lived. The decision by Madrid to suspend the Catalan parliament is a short-term solution to the problem, as the two sides are still locked in a stalemate. The Spanish government is in the process of making it easier for companies headquartered in Catalonia to switch their head office to another part of Spain. While Madrid is keeping the pressure on Catalonia, it is likely that dealers will steer clear of the Spanish stock market. Spanish equities and government bonds are underperforming other European markets after Catalonia\u2019s head of foreign affairs said the region\u2019s parliament would meet on Monday. It is in defiance of Madrid, after the the Spanish constitutional court suspended the Catalan parliament, threatening more tensions and instability. The Spanish IBEX is down 0.8% at 10,138, while yields on benchmark 10-year bonds were up seven basis points at 1.76%. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors: Once again, the market has proved its resilience and confounded the doom mongers. Not that there is too much to get excited about with these figures which confirm what we have seen at the coalface recently - that prices are holding up reasonably well where vendors are realistic, partly in response to a continuing shortage of stock. Sadly, we are not seeing the hoped-for autumn bounce but a steady market is more than welcome with so much uncertain economic news. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, is not convinced by the Halifax report: The sudden surge in Halifax\u2019s measure of house prices\u2014up 3% over the last three months alone\u2014is impossible to reconcile with all the other housing market evidence. Halifax\u2019s measure is the most volatile of all the indices we track. Other surveys show that the pipeline of demand is soft; RICS has reported that new buyer enquiries have fallen in six of the last seven months. Real wages still have further to fall over the next six months and mortgage rates will rise soon in response to the increase in banks\u2019 funding costs. As such, we expect most of the pickup in Halifax\u2019s index to unwind over the coming months. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, says that a flight of equity from London is fuelling activity in the regions: In the current cautious market, prices treading water is good \u2013 and stability plus gentle growth is very good. But momentum remains patchy and what growth there is is wavering rather than sustained, and prices remain under intense pressure in several key regions. In London, prices have been sliding in many of the areas that saw the frothiest rates of growth during the boom. On the flipside, the flight of equity from the capital is fuelling activity in several regional markets where affordability and perceived value for money is now enticing higher volumes of buyers. Halifax said UK house prices are partly being propped up by a shortage of homes on the market: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Annual house prices rose by 4% in September according to the Halifax price index. It was the strongest rate of growth since February, bucking the trend of other recent reports which have indicated a weakening market. Over the month, prices were up 0.8% reaching a record high of \u00a3255,109, and smashing economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.1% increase. August\u2019s figure was also revised up to show 1.5% growth over the month, up from a previous estimate of 1.1%. House prices in the three months to September were 1.4% higher than in the previous quarter, the fastest quarterly increase since February. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax Community Bank: The annual rate of growth has picked up for the second consecutive month, rising from 2.6% in August to 4% in September. The average house price is now \u00a3225,109 \u2013 the highest on record. UK house prices continue to be supported by an ongoing shortage of properties for sale and solid growth in full-time employment. However, increasing pressure on spending power and continuing affordability concerns may well dampen buyer demand. Investors and economists are increasingly betting that Bank of England policymakers will raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in November. Galley says this shouldn\u2019t weigh on the housing market: There has been recent speculation on the possibility of a rise in the Bank of England base rate. We do not anticipate this will have a significant effect on transaction volumes. Wall Street hit fresh record highs on Thursday, with risk appetite among investors boosted by signs of a robust US economy. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.6% at 2,552.07. It was the sixth consecutive closing high for the first time in more than 20 years. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group: A backdrop of strong economic data, optimism for corporate earnings in the third quarter and the recently released plan for tax cuts are fuelling the latest surge. It\u2019s hard to see how Donald Trump\u2019s plan to revamp the US economy can live up to the hyped-up expectations but repeatedly fresh record highs indicate confidence not caution. It\u2019s pretty quiet in markets across Europe this morning, as markets await the main event at 1.30pm with the publication of the US non-farm payrolls report in September. Markets are feeling a little more relaxed about developments in Spain, where politicians in Catalonia do no seem able to agree on the best way forward. For now at least, that is helping to ease investor fears. In the UK the FTSE 100 is up just 9 points but is comfortably above the 7,500 mark, having gained 300 points in three weeks. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,517 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.02% at 12,971 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 5,371 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 22,476 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.4% at 10,177 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 390 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and business. The pound is under renewed pressure this morning as uncertainty builds over Theresa May\u2019s future as Prime Minister. Grant Shapps, a Tory MP and a former party chairman, has admitted his role in a plan to put pressure on May to call a leadership election. He said MPs were \u201cperfectly within their rights\u201d to call for a contest after May\u2019s gamble to win a bigger majority at the general election did not pay off. He told BBC radio 5 live: We did have a result that was not at all what anyone wanted, least of all what she wanted or anticipated, and... sometimes when things happen you have to take responsibility for them. This is a view I have held for quite some time and quite a lot of colleagues feel the same way, including five former cabinet ministers. The pound is down 0.4% at $1.3065. That\u2019s the lowest against the dollar since 7 September. It\u2019s partly a story of dollar strength as traders bet on a December US interest rate rise. But the pound is also at a three-week low against the euro, down 0.3% at \u20ac1.1169. CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson gives this take: The pound has had another poor week its third weekly decline in a row, as concerns about political instability as well as disappointing economic data have undermined sentiment. seems likely that this discontent will once again amount to nothing more than hot air in the short term at least. The last thing the currency, the Conservative party and more importantly the country needs right now is the self-indulgence of another leadership battle. Also coming up today... 8.30am BST: September\u2019s Halifax house prices report will provide the latest snapshot of the UK housing market. 9.30am BST: UK productivity figures for April to June. British productivity has been pretty dismal in recent years and policymakers believe improvement here is the key to unlocking stronger wage growth. We\u2019ll bring you the latest. 1.30pm BST: The closely watched non-farm payrolls for September. Economists are predicting a sharp fall in the number of jobs added, to 90,000 in September, from 156,000 in August, as a result of hurricane disruption. The report will also give the latest insight into the pace of earnings growth in the world\u2019s largest economy.",

Wage growth jumped significantly month-on-month, from 0.2% to 0.5%, while the unemployment rate hit a fresh 16 year low of 4.2%. It\u2019s not a stretch to see those numbers as tipping the Fed\u2019s dovish/hawkish scales towards the latter, with a December rate hike now coming into sharper focus.</p> <p>The dollar reacted as one would expect, widening its gains against the pound.., while taking 0.1% off the euro and half a percent off the yen...</p> <p>And what of poor, fragile sterling? Well September\u2019s super surge is looking more and more like an anomaly, the Tories once again finding a way to undermine confidence in the currency. Cable\u2019s stuck at a sub-$1.305 one month nadir, while against the euro the pound has cemented a fresh 3 week low after falling half a percent. And the thing is, there is no guarantee that next week will be any better, especially if the weekend papers are as filled with Tory infighting as one would expect.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d791c8e4b0c8da8831c42a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-06T14:23:10.613Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Convertbond/status/916305471971131393\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Probability of a December Rate Hike<br><br>October 6: 80%<br>September 8: 19%<br><br>*interest rate futures: Fed speak and wage pressure going the trick</p>&mdash; Lawrence McDonald (@Convertbond) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Convertbond/status/916305471971131393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d78e67e4b076f91939c03f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dominic-rushe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-06T14:09:47.377Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our report on the US jobs data.

Analysts point to the strong pay growth giving the Federal Reserve leeway to raise rates in December.</p> <p>So sterling has hit a four week low against the dollar, while the US currency was at its strongest level against the euro since mid-August. Against the yen, the greenback hit its highest since mid-July. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hurricane disruption dragged payrolls negative, but a big fall in unemployment and significant wage increases make a December rate hike look probable...</p> <p>Despite the softness in payrolls the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.4%. The other big number is the 0.5% month on month jump in wages \u2013 the biggest increase since November 2008 \u2013 which takes the annual wage growth number up to 2.9%. Note that there were also some upward revisions to monthly wage rates so we may finally be seeing some of the strength in jobs feeding through into inflation pressures.</p> <p>Payrolls will bounce back strongly given the Bureau for Labour Statistics suggests that 1.47mn people were unable to get to work because of storm disruption. Moreover, labour demand indicators remain strong in other reports.</p> <p>This positive overall story on the labour market is only going to strengthen the case for higher interest rates. We already know that the growth outlook is strong \u2013 underlined by the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys hitting 13 and 12 year highs respectively this week \u2013 and inflation is heading back towards target \u2013 next week\u2019s headline CPI expected at 2.1% and core at 1.8% year on year. </p> <p>The arguments justifying higher interest rates is also being broadened with Fed Chair Yellen suggesting \u201cpersistently easy monetary policy\u201d could have \u201cadverse implications for financial stability\u201d, while warning of \u201csomewhat rich\u201d asset valuations. Relatively loose financial conditions \u2013 a flat yield curve and dollar weakness - have been used as arguments that could justify action by other Fed officials. It therefore seems that the main risk to our December rate hike call is politics and the potential for an economically and market disruptive government shutdown. However, we remain hopeful that this can be avoided clearing the way for another two rate hikes in 2018.</p> </blockquote> <p>Manuel Ortiz-Olave, market analyst at Monex Europe, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Headline job creation had a rough time in September. Although a significant slowdown was expected after the summer\u2019s tropical storms, not many forecasts were expecting to see a contraction. The most important surprise, however, comes from a significant increase in wage growth and a new drop in the unemployment rate to fresh 16-year lows.</p> <p>Wage growth has been the last piece of the inflation puzzle for the Federal Reserve over the last several quarters, as it remained stubbornly low despite a strong economic recovery and continued new lows in the unemployment rate. Albeit late, wage growth finally made an appearance in September with a massive increase well above expectations. Despite the contraction in employment, the three-month average of headline job creation remains above 100.000 jobs/month, which will not discourage the Fed from a hike.</p> <p>There can be no more doubt, the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates before year end as already strong data now has the support of the Fed\u2019s \u201cprodigal son\u201d: wage growth. This suggests the economy will grow at a strong pace in the last quarter of the year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d78162e4b00593b4d67411\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-06T13:17:06.729Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a chart showing clearly the impact on leisure and hospitality jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67dc320940cfe591fa7dd1fd90361a6489dcc498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67dc320940cfe591fa7dd1fd90361a6489dcc498/106_84_951_937/500.jpg\" alt=\"nonfarm0ct6\" width=\"500\" height=\"493\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>And here is the unemployment data and monthly changes:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2542626c13042ba0a54f297073058c411dc206b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2542626c13042ba0a54f297073058c411dc206b0/0_0_1327_510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"nonfarmoct6x2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"384\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d77f7be4b0c8da8831c3dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-06T13:11:01.979Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Other key figures from the non-farms report show the overall <strong>jobless rate</strong> fell unexpectedly to 4.2% from 4.4%.</p> <p><strong>Pay growth </strong>was also better-than-expected, picking up to 0.5% in September from 0.2% in August.

      "bodyText": "The 2 Sisters Food Group was warned eight years ago that staff could be changing the dates on its chicken products, it has emerged as food industry regulators widened their investigation into the business to 12 poultry processing plants operated by the company. Jack Dromey, the shadow business secretary, said he had told the multimillionaire owner of 2 Sisters, Ranjit Singh Boparan, about workers informing him that dates on the company\u2019s chicken were changed, \u201cso that meat, that should have been thrown away, was sold to supermarkets\u201d. Dromey\u2019s claims follow a Guardian and ITV News investigation that revealed poor hygiene standards and food safety records being altered at a 2 Sisters plant in West Bromwich. Dromey, who was deputy general secretary of the the Transport and General Workers\u2019 union before being elected as MP for Birmingham Erdington in 2010, said the conversation took place during negotiations between the two men in 2009, over the reinstatement of 59 workers sacked in relation to a wildcat strike at the 2 Sisters\u2019 former factory in Smethwick. The comments come after 2 Sisters, the country\u2019s largest supplier of supermarket chicken, suspended production at the West Bromwich plant on Sunday after the joint investigation, which captured undercover footage of an instance of workers changing the slaughter dates of poultry. Dromey said: \u201cSome of [Boparan\u2019s] workers, who he had sacked, told us that often the dating of chicken meat was changed so that meat that should have been thrown away was sold to supermarkets. I remember that vividly and putting it to Ranjit Singh and not for one moment did he deny it. \u201cHe accepted that there were practices within the company that he said the company was already addressing and they were determined to clean their act up. Well it\u2019s clear from the evidence available now that, whatever may have happened at the end of 2009, 2010, there remain very significant problems within 2 Sisters.\u201d The Guardian and ITV\u2019s footage on \u201ckill date\u201d labels being switched was filmed in August, about four miles away from the old Smethwick site in the West Bromwich plant, called Site D. When contacted about Dromey\u2019s remarks on the former factory in Smethwick, 2 Sisters declined to respond to them specifically. Instead it issued a statement about its West Bromwich plant, that read: \u201cAs we made clear, the Food Standards Agency has been carrying out investigations at Site D on a daily basis since the allegations were first made public. \u201cSite D was also subject to regular, often unannounced audits in the weeks preceding your investigation. None of these audits or investigations have identified any issues or any breaches of regulations. \u201cWe are continuing to support our colleagues during our retraining period and we remain committed to ensuring that we operate to the highest standards of hygiene and food safety, and we act with honesty and integrity at all times.\u201d Separately, a quality assurance manager who worked at Site D during 2009 has told the Guardian and ITV News that kill labels were changed in the factory at that time and that sometimes this happened more than once a day. The manager said complaints about the date switches were made to more senior managers, but the practice was not stopped. \u201cIt was more important to get the amount of orders through the door,\u201d the manager said. Experts said altering \u201ckill dates\u201d could artificially stretch the commercial life of the meat and dupe consumers into buying chicken past its use-by date. It is illegal to place incorrect use-by dates on food, which are set for safety reasons and differ from \u201cbest before\u201d dates. The comments by Dromey and the former worker come after Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, Aldi and Lidl all suspended deliveries from the West Bromwich plant, which 2 Sisters then announced on Sunday would be temporarily shut after the company had discovered \u201csome isolated instances of non-compliance with our own quality management systems\u201d. Announcing the widening of its investigation on Friday, the Food Standards Agency said it was now looking at a total of 11 sites in England and Wales while its Scottish counterpart said it was also looking at one plant. The FSA said it had not found any threats to public health at the West Bromwich plant but it had identified issues that required \u201cmanagement attention\u201d. The investigation is centred on food hygiene and labelling. \u201cConsumers deserve food they can trust and can be reassured that we take allegations of poor practice very seriously,\u201d said the FSA chairwoman, Heather Hancock. \u201cAlthough our initial inspection [of the West Bromwich site] found no risk to public health, we are broadening our investigations until we are satisfied that this is truly the case.\u201d In a statement, the FSA said its initial investigation at the Site D plant had highlighted \u201cissues requiring management attention\u201d, pointing to staff training and stock control. The organisation is now looking at whether there were training and stock control \u2013 or labelling \u2013 issues at other sites, although labelling falls outside the FSA\u2019s remit and requires liaising with local authorities. The FSA added that it was working with the major retailers supplied by 2 Sisters and reviewing information from other sources. The other plants that will be investigated are in locations ranging from Cullompton in Devon to Anglesey in Wales, Coupar Angus in Scotland, Scunthorpe and Basildon. In a conference call with its investors on Tuesday, 2 Sisters management admitted they had found \u201cother areas of concern\u201d, centred on food hygiene standards, at the West Bromwich site. The company also said the closure would cost the company up to \u00a3500,000 a week and that it was treating the incident as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d. \u201cWe do not believe that we have got any major compliance issues in our organisation,\u201d said the 2 Sisters chief operating officer, Martyn Fletcher, on the call. \u201cIt\u2019s isolated to this particular video footage and we have, in investigating the site, found some other areas of concern at that site.\u201d Commenting on the extension of the FSA investigation to all of the company\u2019s poultry plants, 2 Sisters said: \u201cWe receive regular audits at all our English and Welsh sites by the FSA throughout the year, so of course we will welcome our FSA colleagues at any location they wish to inspect in the coming days.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "State Street, the asset manager that became an unlikely champion of feminism after it installed the Fearless Girl statue on Wall Street, discriminated against hundreds of female executives by paying them less than male colleagues, according to US regulators. The money manager, which oversees $2.6tn in assets, is paying $5m to settle charges that it underpaid about 300 women in its employ. An audit by the US Department of Labor found that women in senior positions at the Boston-based company had received lower base salaries, bonuses and total compensation since at least December 2010. The audit, by the office of federal contract compliance programmes (OFCCP), looked at pay scales between 2010 and 2011 and found that \u201cstatistically significant disparity in compensation remained even when legitimate factors affecting pay were taken into account\u201d. \u201cState Street is committed to equal pay practices and evaluates on an ongoing basis our internal processes to be sure our compensation, hiring and promotions programs are nondiscriminatory. While we disagreed with the OFCCP\u2019s analysis and findings, we have cooperated fully with them, and made a decision to bring this six-year-old matter to resolution and move forward,\u201d the company said in a statement.

      "bodyText": "The US jobs market stalled in September, losing 33,000 jobs, as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma took their toll. It was the first time in seven years that the US monthly total had recorded a fall. The US economy had added an average of 176,000 new jobs a month so far this year but as the labor department had predicted the storms, which caused fatal and catastrophic damage across Texas and Florida, slowed hiring. But a loss in jobs was far worse than the 80,000 new jobs most US economists had expected would be created. It ends the longest stretch of uninterrupted jobs growth in US history. This was the first loss in jobs since September 2010. Ahead of Friday\u2019s jobs report the Bureau of Labor Statistics said some 11.2 million workers lived in the affected areas, about 7.7% of the US workforce. Employment in food services and drinking places declined by 105,000 in September. That sector has added an average of 24,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months. The unemployment rate, which was 4.4% in August, fell to 4.2%, a 16-year low. This is the second month of disappointing growth in the US jobs market. In August the economy added 156,000 new jobs, below the 180,000 that had been expected by economists. August\u2019s jobs report was revised up from 156,000 to 169,000 but July\u2019s was revised down to 138,000 from 189,000, a net loss of 38,000 for the two months. The disappointing jobs figures could continue. After Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, the US reported a 35,000 decline in jobs, well below the three-month average of 175,000 in job gains. It took two payroll reports for the jobs market to recover. On Wednesday ADP, the payrolls processor, said the private sector had added 135,000 jobs in September, sharply down from the 228,000 added in August. \u201cHurricanes Harvey and Irma hurt the job market in September,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s, which helps compile the ADP report. But he added that: \u201cLooking through the storms the job market remains sturdy and strong.\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cIf past storms, particularly Katrina, are any guide, employment will rebound markedly over the next few months. The drop in the unemployment rate might persist, however, with consumer and small business surveys both pointing to a drop in the unemployment rate to nearer 4% for some time.\u201d Puerto Rico, the US territory also devastated by the hurricanes, is not counted in the jobs report.",

    "webTitle": "Fall in productivity puts pressure on Hammond before budget", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The productivity of UK workers fell in the three months to June, piling pressure on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, before his budget next month. Despite increasing numbers of hours put in by workers, labour productivity as measured by output per hour fell by 0.1% in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics. That continues a fall started earlier this year, albeit at a slower pace, from the 0.5% drop recorded in the three months to March. The figures will prove troubling for the chancellor, as weak productivity stands to erode the public finances by signalling weaker economic growth. The figures also rank Britain among the weakest of the G7 economies for labour productivity, although the gap with rival nations narrowed to 15.4% last year from 16.1% in 2015. Philip Wales of the ONS said: \u201cUK labour productivity continued to lag behind our international partners in 2016 ... analysis suggests that this lower level of productivity was evident across all industries, although the size of the gap varies considerably.\u201d Some industries are more productive than others. Manufacturing firms are among the most efficient \u2013 such as mining, quarrying and pharmaceuticals \u2013 because workers put in a relatively small share of total hours worked across the wider economy. The UK\u2019s largest sector, services, accounts for a larger share of hours worked, at below average productivity. Firms that attract investment from overseas are also about 74% more productive than domestic firms. The UK ranks fifth out of the top seven advanced global economies, with Canada and Japan having weaker levels of productivity. Germany is the most productive nation per hour, while the US is top for output per worker. The UK has been in a prolonged period of weak productivity since the financial crisis. Brexit could be exacerbating the problem, as businesses turn back from investing in more efficient equipment owing to fears over the strength of the economy. Meanwhile, unemployment is at its lowest level since the mid-1970s - indicating that companies are preferring to invest in people rather than technology. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, a forecasting group, said: \u201cGiven the uncertain economic and political outlook, it may be that several companies are trying to meet extra work by taking on labour rather than commit to investment.\u201d The weakness could be attributed to the creation of low-skilled, low-paid jobs in the economy, in which productivity - is limited. Despite the low jobless rate, wage growth is failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living. Some economists also suggest there could be a link between weak productivity and low interest rates, as unproductive companies are able to continue operating by borrowing cheaply from banks and the financial markets. That could change as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade from as early as November. Next week the Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to admit that its forecasts for improving productivity growth have proved to be consistently optimistic. The government\u2019s independent forecaster will say that the trend for lower productivity growth since the 2008 crash is likely to persist for several more years, warranting a downgrade from its March forecast. Without an improvement in productivity, the UK economy is expected to miss out on expected increases in wages and living standards, putting further pressure on the welfare system and depressing tax receipts. Treasury officials are known to believe that the downgrade will wipe out about two-thirds of the government\u2019s \u00a326bn war chest, which the chancellor set aside in the last budget to spend in the event of a slowdown following a disorderly and damaging exit from the EU. Hammond was expected to use some of the money in the autumn budget on 22 November to increase public sector pay and alleviate a spending squeeze that is hitting schools, hospitals and the police service at a time when all three services are under strain. But the loss of about \u00a318bn over the next four years after a reduction in productivity growth will severely limit his room for manoeuvre.",

      "bodyText": "The 9.3% fall in new car registrations in September \u2013 a figure even weaker than expected \u2013 is alarming. September is the second-biggest month in the car trade and it is now odds-on that registrations will fall in 2017 for the first time in six years. One can argue all day about usefulness of car sales as a barometer of general economic confidence, but the figures usually crop up in the discussions of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee. They matter. What\u2019s going on? A few factors are obvious. Sales had been rising strongly for five years and no winning run lasts forever, especially if the product comes with a three- or four-year warranty. Some of the recent growth has been super-charged by personal contract purchase plans, and the Bank is now warning lenders of the risks to themselves in over-extending credit. Then there\u2019s the fact that the government, to the fury of car manufacturers, has sown confusion about the future taxation of diesel vehicles. Sales of diesel cars were a remarkable 21.7% lower than a year ago. All of the above can be filed under \u201cspecial factors\u201d. The open question is how much weakness is being caused by wider uncertainty, specifically over the terms of Brexit and the possibility of a rise in interest rate next month? In the Bank\u2019s shoes, you\u2019d be alarmed by 10.1% plunge in fleet sales with the new car figures. That may indicate that business investment is falling fast. It may also suggest that, if the Bank was really keen to reverse last year\u2019s post-referendum quarter-point cut in interest rates, the best moment was a year ago, when the Brexit slump failed to materialise. Another good moment may arrive when (if?) a transition deal is secured with the EU. At the moment, though, the talks with the EU appear stuck in neutral. A November rate rise is starting to look increasingly like a risk the Bank does not need to take. Energy companies are digging themselves into an ever-deeper hole The energy companies are remarkably slow \u2013 still \u2013 at reading the political weather. As we report today, they are issuing various warnings-cum-threats about a price cap on energy bills. Impossible to do in time for winter, they say. Due process must be followed, runs one objection, and that means stringing out the plot until next spring. Another argument says there is no point co-operating with regulator Ofgem\u2019s likely extension of the current limited cap for \u201cvulnerable\u201d customers if it is just a prelude to a wider-ranging cap on standard variable tariffs (SVTs). Lawyers are being warmed up, it seems. If the companies intend to play hardball, they\u2019re making a tactical mistake. While Iain Conn, chief executive of Centrica, is probably correct that a price cap is a blunt instrument that will undermine competition by pushing companies to \u201ccluster\u201d their tariffs, he and his peers need to appreciate the political forces at play. On one side, the Labour opposition wants to renationalise the industry. On the other, a desperate government seeks to re-arm its \u201cindependent\u201d regulator and bully it into delivering the price cap it has promised the voters, complete with \u00a3100-a-household savings for SVT customers. One way or another, something is going to happen. The companies\u2019 best approach is to be sweetly reasonable and argue for a loosely fitted cap, such as a \u201crelative\u201d structure that pegs default tariffs within a set percentage point of the cheapest deal. That seems a more fruitful avenue than legal bloody-mindedness. When in a hole, stop digging. Toilet paper maker Accrol flushed away as shares suspended Officials at the London Stock Exchange tend to get very cross if you repeat the old insult about the Alternative Investment Market being a casino. They have a point since a few wonder stocks, such as online clothing retailer Asos and tonic firm Fever-Tree, can be found on the junior stock exchange. But then there are cases like Accrol. This Blackburn-based maker of own-label toilet rolls arrived on AIM a year ago and said last month that trading was \u201cin line with market expectations\u201d. To put it mildly, that statement has unravelled. Earnings will now be \u201csignificantly below\u201d forecasts because of a rise in paper pulp prices, debt will be \u201ccorrespondingly higher\u201d, and, by the way, a looming fine from the Health and Safety Executive may have \u201ca material impact\u201d on the cash position. Trading in the shares was suspended \u201cpending clarification\u201d of Accrol\u2019s \u201cfinancial circumstances\u201d. Investors and the AIM authorities may also want a clarification from the company and its advisers: why wasn\u2019t the risk of a fine, which relates to a factory accident before the flotation, mentioned in the prospectus?",

Sir Peter Soulsby, the mayor of Leicester, who organised the event, said: \u201cWe have to acknowledge there are unethical and illegal working practices in the industry, which are preventing retailers from buying more locally. \u201cThis is not just an issue for Leicester, but a national one.

Former New Look boss Anders Kristiansen has described the situation as \u201ca ticking timebomb\u201d. A damning 2015 report revealed endemic exploitation inside the East Midlands garment industry. According to researchers at the University of Leicester, up to 90% of those working in the sector were being paid \u00a33 an hour \u2013 less than half the legal minimum wage. The Leicestershire area has the second highest concentration of textile manufacturing in the UK, with 1,500 businesses employing about 10,000 people. Sir David Metcalf, the government\u2019s director of labour market enforcement, who is developing a national strategy to prevent the exploitation of workers across UK industry including textiles, will speak at the event.

      "bodyText": "DFS, the sofa retailer, has announced a 22% plunge in annual profits as consumers cut back on big-ticket purchases. The company, which also owns Sofa Workshop and Dwell and has 113 shops in the UK and Ireland, said profits dropped from \u00a364.5m to \u00a350m for the year to 29 July, although revenues edged up 0.9% to \u00a3763m. The firm said the furniture market had got tougher in the spring, with fewer shoppers and orders between April and June. The period included the snap election called by Theresa May. Ian Filby, the DFS chief executive, said trade had stabilised a little in July after \u201ca tough three or four months\u201d but orders had continued to fall. \u201cThe weakening in demand proved unexpectedly severe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK furniture market continues to be very challenging and the outlook for the sector remains uncertain.\u201d DFS said the weaker pound had driven up the costs of imported materials. Sterling has lost 11% of its value against the dollar since last year\u2019s Brexit vote. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cDFS has been hit by a double whammy of slowing consumer demand and rising costs, stemming from a weaker pound. \u201cBig-ticket items like sofas tend to be the first things consumers cut back on when they are feeling the pinch,\u201d he said. \u201cThings don\u2019t look like they are getting much easier either, with DFS expecting weak trading conditions to continue into the next financial year.\u201d Poor sales figures from Britain\u2019s car industry for September provided further evidence that consumers, under pressure from stagnating wages and rising inflation after the Brexit vote, were too cash strapped to make big purchases. Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cDFS has been here before, coping with recessions and downturns that stop customers splashing out on big-ticket items. \u201cThe company is right to point this out and that this is down to \u2018fundamental strengths in store sales densities, scale of operations, flexible cost base and vertically integrated business model\u2019\u2026 What has investors worried still is that the outlook has not improved: the results statement is pretty bleak.\u201d Wilson predicted that like-for-like revenue growth would be more difficult to achieve. \u201cEconomic headwinds are battering retailers that deal in higher-value items, and there is not much sign of this changing,\u201d he said. \u201cA big Christmas sales rush would help restore confidence, but it doesn\u2019t look like consumers are ready to oblige.\u201d",
