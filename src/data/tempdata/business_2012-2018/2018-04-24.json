      "bodyText": "Australia is hoping to secure a permanent exemption to US steel tariffs before they come into force on 1 May but if not will have to rely on another temporary reprieve, the Australian Industry Group says. The 1 May deadline when US steel tariffs will apply to all countries including Australia is fast approaching and no permanent exemption has yet been put in place, according to the US Customs and Border Protection agency. Earlier in April the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, said Malcolm Turnbull had \u201csecured an agreement with the US president that Australia will be exempt and that continues to be the case\u201d. But for two weeks Ciobo and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have refused to answer questions about when and how the Australian government expects a permanent exemption to be implemented. Ciobo will travel to the US this week for a series of G\u2019Day USA events to promote Australian trade, tourism and investment opportunities and an Anzac Day event in New York. A spokesman for Ciobo denied the trip was a last-ditch attempt to lobby over the steel tariff deadline. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, told Guardian Australia it was \u201caware that the formal ratification of Australia\u2019s exemption from the steel and aluminium tariffs applied by the USA has not yet been completed\u201d. \u201cWe are hopeful that a new proclamation confirming Australia\u2019s exemption will be made in the coming days, however, based on past experience, if the necessary instruments are not ready by 30 April, we expect that there will be an announcement extending our exemption by another 30 days,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that any uncertainty that has been created is resolved quickly for Australian industry.\u201d On 23 March when the White House first declared that the steel tariff exemptions would only be temporary, Willox was a fierce critic of the \u201cwhimsical policy shifts\u201d in US trade policy, but Australian government assurances appear to have settled nerves among some business groups. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, said it understands that the Australian government \u201cis working to ensure that the concessions to Australia remain in place\u201d. \u201cWe are confident they will,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no suggestion that the steel tariff exemption has fallen through. \u201cMinister Ciobo\u2019s trip to the US is an opportunity to reaffirm Australia\u2019s commitment to free trade and continue to encourage our major trade and investment partners to do likewise.\u201d Australia and Japan were instrumental in keeping the Trans-Pacific Partnership together after Donald Trump withdrew the US from the free trade agreement. Earlier in April Trump asked advisors to examine re-entering the TPP and then clarified that he would only lead the US back into the deal if it got a better deal than negotiated by the Obama administration. In a statement announcing his trip, Ciobo said two-way investment between Australia and the US had grown by more than 130% from 2005 to 2016 to a total of $1.5tn. \u201cThe total stock of US investment in Australia was A$861bn at the end of 2016, making the United States Australia\u2019s largest foreign investor by far,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "TSB\u2019s botched IT \u201cupgrade\u201d has snowballed into a full-scale crisis, with up to 1.9 million customers locked out of their accounts for a sixth day, MPs demanding action and the bank facing a potential multimillion-pound compensation bill and regulatory fines. In one of the worst IT problems to hit Britain\u2019s banking sector in years, TSB took all its internet and mobile services offline for emergency repair work, after a migration to a new platform over the weekend backfired. TSB\u2019s chief executive, Paul Pester, apologised for the chaos on Tuesday morning, promising that services would resume by the afternoon and that \u201cno one will be left out of pocket as a result of these service issues\u201d. But at the end of the working day, and with TSB branches closed, customers were still unable to access their accounts online. Customers reported waiting for more than an hour to get through to the phone banking service. Owners of small businesses said they were unable to pay salaries or manage transactions, while some account holders found all their direct debits had disappeared. Lee MacDonald, a former actor who starred as Zammo in Grange Hill, was among the small business owners affected. He said his company, Mentor Lock and Safe Company, in Wallington, south London, had \u201cliterally stopped\u201d. In TSB branches, some customers were told it could be another 48 hours before they could access their accounts properly, while the bank\u2019s website said some issues, such as one-time passwords and Isa transfers, would be fixed by the end of April. The crisis began on Friday night, when TSB began a long-planned migration of 1.3bn customer records away from former parent company Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s IT systems, on to a platform created by TSB\u2019s new Spanish owners, Sabadell. The job should have been completed by 6pm on Sunday. Pester admitted that, in one glitch, customers were shown entries in other accounts: \u201c402 customers could see some data that we would not normally show them online.\u201d While most TSB account holders had been able to continue using their debit cards to make payments and withdraw cash from ATMs, many alleged the problems were deeper than the bank was admitting. Outside a branch in the City of London, Mac, a retired photographer, said he was appalled by the bank\u2019s problems. \u201cAll my direct debits have disappeared,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were there yesterday but gone today. And there\u2019s something saying the last payment was in 2099. I\u2019ve also had to change my password to get into the account. \u201cThe thing that most infuriates me is the statements coming out of the bank. They are not being honest. They keep saying it\u2019s \u2018intermittent\u2019 when it\u2019s not. At first I tried to phone. I was on the line for an hour but then gave up and came down here. They have told me it will be sorted out in 48 hours from today, but I don\u2019t know what to believe.\u201d Alex, who runs a professional consultancy firm, said outside the branch: \u201cI have salaries to pay today. I\u2019ve had to come down here to arrange for a bulk transfer over to HSBC, and we\u2019ll have to pay the salaries from there. \u201cI tried calling the helpline, but after a while the line just goes blank. We\u2019ve had grief with them ever since we were moved from Lloyds. They\u2019re not really a business bank.\u201d Many have called for compensation similar to the \u00a370m RBS paid out after the previous big IT meltdown in banking in 2012. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury committee, has written to Pester to demand answers; he will also contact the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). \u201cThis is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money. \u201cWarm words and platitudes will not suffice. TSB customers deserve to know what has happened, when normal services will resume, and how they can expect to be compensated.\u201d Multimillion-pound bonuses to Pester and 30 other senior TSB staff, which were dependent on the IT migration, are now under threat. The payouts, which include a \u00a31.6m bonus for Pester, were frozen after TSB was forced to delay the move from Lloyds to Sabadell last year. TSB\u2019s remuneration committee has yet to decide whether to pay the bonuses. The FCA and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said they were investigating the problems. They have the power to fine TSB for the botched system upgrade and data breaches.",

      "bodyText": "More unhappy customers are taking to Twitter, as they realise that TSB has failed to meet its goal of restoring services this afternoon. Tomorrow\u2019s Daily Mail gives TSB a proper roasting - calling it the Totally Shambolic Bank. They also flag up that TSB fears some problems won\u2019t be solved until the end of this month (the bank\u2019s service status webpage has more details) I fear he\u2019s right.... which means TSB are going to face some tough questions in the morning. TSB has been encouraging customers to contact its telephone banking team with any problems. So, predictably, that service is now overwhelmed by demand. Some people say they had to wait for over an hour, only to be cut off! A late update: There\u2019s still no sign that TSB has resolved the crisis. Instead, the bank is still telling customers that it\u2019s sorry, and working on a fix -- the same message we\u2019ve been hearing since Sunday night. It\u2019s all gone quiet over at TSB, so here\u2019s our latest news story on the bank\u2019s IT problems: I\u2019ll be back later if there are any major developments. If TSB don\u2019t get things sorted in the next 12 hours, there could a real backlash on Wednesday. Anger among its customers is already bubbling.... TSB customers continue to report problems tonight, as TSB\u2019s tech staff wrestle with its internet banking system. There\u2019s a strong suspicion that TSB rushed its IT migration, leading to the current mess. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, thinks the move was partly driven pressure to get it done before the Bank of England raises interest rates in May (which could spark a rush of customers seeking mortgage deals). But the other driver was cost. Nils writes: Under the terms of its separation from Lloyds Banking Group in 2014, TSB effectively pays rent to use its old IT system. The cost of this \u201ctransitional service agreement\u201d soared last year from \u00a391.8m to \u00a3214m, according to the 2017 accounts. Delay, in effect, was costing \u00a310m-plus a month. \u201cWe would never rush if we didn\u2019t think we were ready,\u201d said TSB. Banking and data regulators will want to test that statement in detail. TSB CEO Paul Pester is now on Sky News, discussing the IT crisis which forced the bank to take its internet banking and mobile app offline this morning. He says that the vast majority of TSB\u2019s services have been running smoothly since last weekend\u2019s IT migration. Q: So what\u2019s gone wrong? Pester says that TSB\u2019s website app struggled with a \u201clarge number of concurrent users\u201d, who tried to access their accounts on Sunday evening once the migration process was over. We didn\u2019t have enough bandwidth to cope, he says - so we\u2019re addressing that problem now. Q: Was the new platform not tested properly? Pester says there was \u201cextensive testing\u201d, with nine cycles of testing before the bank took the plunge. It\u2019s very hard to recreate how customers are going to use the platform. he says. Q: When will your internet and mobile banking be back online? Pester says he\u2019d \u201clove to think\u201d they would be up very soon, ideally this evening (so the old target of this afternoon is officially abandoned). But this is the biggest bank account migration Europe has seen, and he\u2019s told TSB\u2019s IT staff not to bring services back online until they\u2019re sure they\u2019re ready. Q: Are you braced for a big fine from regulators? Pester says TSB are talking to the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) and the PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority). Both have been \u201cinvolved with us on this journey\u201d, he adds, so they know the situation well, and they\u2019re being kept up to speed. Q: What about compensation? Any customer who is out of pocket, we will put it right, Pester pledges. He says that mortgage services have been running very smoothly, as have ATMs and credit cards. Q: Are you going to lose your bonus? That\u2019s up to the remuneration committee and the board to decide, says Pester. He ends by apologising profusely to customers, saying he understands their frustration. ITV just broadcast more of its pre-recorded interview with Paul Pester. In it, Pester says his IT staff have told him the online banking would be fixed by 2pm today (it wasn\u2019t!). Pester, though, is more sceptical so is aiming for mid-afternoon (it wasn\u2019t ready then either!). My colleague Rupert Jones has pulled together a Q&amp;A on the IT crisis at TSB. Here\u2019s a flavour: Why was it conducting an upgrade in the first place? TSB was carved out of Lloyds Bank and then bought in 2015 by Spain\u2019s Banco Sabadell. Initially, Lloyds continued to handle the IT infrastructure for TSB, but this upgrade was about moving 1.3bn customer records over to a \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d banking platform called Proteo4UK, designed by Sabadell. Will I be compensated? TSB said: \u201cCustomers can rest assured that no one will be left out of pocket as a result of these service issues.\u201d So that should mean people will be compensated if, for example, they incur late payments fees because they are not able to make a payment. Keep any receipts/paperwork, and visit a branch or call the bank and explain that you want to reclaim your money. Right, it\u2019s just turned 6pm -- or exactly 48 hours after TSB\u2019s banking services were meant to be working again after its IT migration. That means we\u2019re also close to the end of the \u2018afternoon\u2019 - which is the deadline set by TSB\u2019s chief this morning. Instead, TSB customers are still in the dark, awaiting fresh information from the bank, and suffering the implications of being locked out of their accounts for so long: TSB Bank chief Paul Pester has promised that no customers have suffered a data breach. Speaking to ITV News, Pester pledged: There\u2019s been no data breach whatsoever. I can categorically say that customers\u2019 data is safe. But what about the people who say they logged in and were shown someone else\u2019s account details? Pester suggests that these reports involved around 400 \u2018linked accounts\u2019, such as between a parent and a child. TSB customers continue to report problems this evening. Some are vowing to close their accounts and others expressing their deep disappointment with the company. Here\u2019s a selection of messages sent to the bank\u2019s social media account in the last few minutes: Time for a quick recap. IT staff at TSB are battling against one of the worst IT problems to hit Britain\u2019s banking sector in years, after its botched IT \u201cupgrade\u201d has snowballed into a major crisis. The bank has taken all its internet and mobile services offline for emergency repair work, after a migration to a new IT platform backfired. Around 1.9 million customers are currently locked out, and facing long waiting times if they try to call TSB\u2019s phone banking service. CEO Paul Pester has apologised, admitted that the bank has fallen far short of expectations, and promised that no-one will be left out of pocket. He says he hopes the work will be completed today. Pester, who failed to face the public on Monday, has called on customers to \u2018bear with\u2019 TSB. He has also been heavily criticised by customers on social media, with many threatening to move their accounts. Angry and upset customers have told us that they\u2019re very worried that direct debits won\u2019t be paid. Small businesses say they can\u2019t pay their own staff, and there are anecdotal reports that some bank cards have been declined in stores. Locksmith Lee MacDonald, who played Zammo in Grange Hill, is among the SMEs affected. He says his business has \u2018literally stopped\u2019. MPs on Britain\u2019s Treasury Committee are demanding action, and the bank facing a potential multimillion-pound compensation bill and regulatory fines. In branches, some customers are being told it could be another 48 hours before they can access their accounts properly, while the bank\u2019s website says some issues, such as one-time passwords and Isa transfers, will only be fixed \u201cby the end of April\u201d. The crisis began on Friday night, when TSB began a long-planned migration away from Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s IT systems, and onto a new platform constructed by its Spanish owners, Sabadell. The job should have been completed by 6pm Sunday - almost two days ago - but instead, customers have been unable to access their accounts. In some cases, they were even shown other accounts. Cybersecurity professor Shujun Li has warned that TSB customers could be more vulnerable to online criminals. TSB has also confirmed that potential seven-figure bonuses for top management are dependent on the IT migration being completed. Its remuneration committee must now decide whether this week\u2019s debacle means the payments should be withheld (the Times did a good piece on this recently) TSB tells us that they\u2019re still hoping to fix their systems today, as CEO Paul Pester pledged this morning. Customers are becoming increasingly desperate to see some progress, having been locked out of their accounts since Friday evening. Remember, they were promised that TSB\u2019s IT migration would be complete by 6pm Sunday, so many wouldn\u2019t have felt the need to take out extra cash to cover the last two days of disruption. TSB have now confirmed that multi-million-pound bonuses to CEO Paul Pester and 30 other senior TSB staff are dependent on the IT migration. As explained earlier, the payouts, which include a \u00a31.6m bonus for Pester, were frozen after TSB was forced to delay the move, from Lloyds to its new owner Sabadell, last year. TSB\u2019s remuneration committee has yet to decide whether to pay the bonuses. Paul Pester\u2019s protestations haven\u2019t cut the mustard with Masterchef contestant Fiona Harris, who has lost access to her TSB account. Bad news for TSB customers -- the bank\u2019s online banking and mobile app is still broken. CEO Paul Pester has popped up online again, to report that the repaid work is still going on: A former star of British children\u2019s television is caught up in the TSB internet banking mess. Lee MacDonald played Zammo, whose descent into heroin addiction gripped the nation 30 years ago. Today, he runs Mentor Lock and Safe Company in Wallington, London -- but this keycutting and locksmith operation has been badly disrupted. MacDonald told Radio 5 Live that he has two business accounts at TSB - and he can\u2019t access either of them. My business has literally stopped. I don\u2019t know what money is coming in, I don\u2019t know what money is going out. I\u2019m in absolute turmoil at the moment. MacDonald says he\u2019s currently unable to pay suppliers, and has been unable to get through to TSB on the phone. He calls the situation an \u201cabsolute nightmare\u201d, and fears a big job scheduled for Friday will fall through. If TSB can\u2019t get its systems and app to work properly, he\u2019ll have to consider moving his account. Sue Capener, 69, who is disabled and lives on her own in Liverpool, has been hit by the TSB IT failures. She was expecting her online food shop to be delivered but her order was cancelled due to a declined payment. She tells us: \u201cI usually get a shop in on Monday but TSB wouldn\u2019t release the funds. I can\u2019t go out and I have no family to help me. Instead I\u2019m sitting here answering calls about my bills not getting paid. \u201cThankfully my four chihuahuas have enough food for the moment.I also saw the man next door and he was able to get me a loaf of bread from the shop but I\u2019m getting stressed out and I\u2019m at breaking point to be honest.\u201d Professor Shujun Li, professor of cyber security at the University of Kent, fears that some TSB customers could be exposed to cybercriminals by the IT chaos at the bank. He believes TSB got its priority badly wrong -- and failed to test its new IT systems properly before migrating all 1.9 million customers. These mistakes include (but aren\u2019t limited to): internal system testing, customer communications, information security management and data protection. Professor Li adds that TSB could be a prime target for a cybercrime attack: \u2018Some criminals (including external attackers and malicious insiders) may have grabbed the opportunities to launch spear phishing attacks and have attempted to steal money from some TSB customers\u2019 accounts. \u2018The problems with biometrics and one time passwords (the latter won\u2019t be solved until the end of April) also suggested that launching an attack on TSB would be easier now if no other security mechanisms are added. \u2018If such attacks did happen or are happening, the chaos we have been observing suggested that TSB will have more difficulties identifying such attacks and providing evidence to support investigations by TSB itself and the law enforcement. TSB isn\u2019t the only bank suffering problems, today. Ulster Bank, part of Royal Bank of Scotland, has admitted that money has been mysteriously vanishing from some customer accounts in recent days. It is now offering emergency funds to those affected, with many people reporting that their salaries have disappeared.... The Irish Times has more details: Money, including monthly salaries has been disappearing from the accounts of Ulster Bank customers since the weekend prompting the bank to launch what it says is an urgent investigation. The issues are not expected to be resolved until tomorrow morning at the earliest. The bank has told impacted customers, who find their accounts overdrawn as a result of the problems, that they will not be out of pocket once the issue is resolved. And it said it will be making emergency cash of up to \u20ac500 available to customers who need it. Ulster Bank customers began reporting issues in significant numbers on Monday and hundreds of complaints have now been posted across social media networks from people who have had money disappear from their accounts leaving them without the funds to pay direct debits which are due. In others instances customers have had their Ulster Bank credit and debit cards declined when making purchases. It appears that money lodged since Friday has left customer accounts. Reuters is reporting that more than 400 TSB customers were shown the wrong account details when they logged in after its IT migration. Here\u2019s the details: Britain\u2019s TSB bank, owned by Spain\u2019s Banco Sabadell, took down its mobile app and online services on Tuesday in an attempt to fix technical problems which have locked customers out of their accounts. The bank said about 402 customers on Sunday were able to see data that they would not usually see online, often of so called \u201dconnected accounts\u201d that family members typically use. TSB Chief Executive Officer Paul Pester said he had worked for 48 hours to fix the problem but that the bank had to takedown both the mobile app and online banking again on Tuesday.The services should be working later today, he said. \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry,\u201d Pester said in a statement. \u201cCustomers can rest assured that no one will be left out of pocket as a result of these service issues.\u201d Pester has written to each customer to apologise. TSB\u2019s service status website shows the full extent of the IT problems - and it\u2019s not a pretty sight. For internet banking, for example, there are issues with one-time passwords, mortgages, savings accounts, credit cards, loans, business internet banking, overdrafts, account balances and transactions, and online messages and documentation. I\u2019m not sure what that leaves, frankly. On credit cards, customers are currently unable to make balance transfers online or raise their borrowing limits; the issue will be fixed \u2018soon\u2019. Savers can\u2019t renew their accounts online, or transfer an ISA - this will be fixed \u2018by the end of April\u2019. TSB\u2019s text-messaging service is also wounded; some customers aren\u2019t receiving them at all, and a solution may not come until the end of the month. Quite apart from being left \u2018out of pocket\u2019, some TSB customers face empty plates unless the bank fixes its IT problems fast. One, Rachel Pollard, says her card was rejected at the supermarket today: Outside a TSB branch in the City of London, both business and personal account holders were dismayed and angry at the continuing chaos affecting the bank. One businessman, Alex, who runs a professional consultancy firm, said: \u201cI have salaries to pay today. I\u2019ve had to come down here to arrange for a bulk transfer over to HSBC, and we\u2019ll have to pay the salaries from there. I tried calling their helpline, but after a while the line just goes blank. To be honest, we\u2019ve had grief with them ever since we were moved from Lloyds. They\u2019re not really a business bank.\u201d He added that his company had not been able to see any transactions or payments on their business account since the \u201cupgrade\u201d began on Friday. A personal account customer, Mac, a retired photographer, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d to discover that all his direct debits had disappeared. \u201cAll my direct debits have disappeared. They were there yesterday, but gone today. And there\u2019s something saying the last payment was in 2099. I\u2019ve also had to change my password to get into the account. \u201cThe thing that most infuriates me is the statements coming out of the bank. They are not being honest. They keep saying it\u2019s \u201cintermittent\u201d when it\u2019s not.\u201d He was heading on holiday tomorrow but had no idea if the usual payments from his account would be made. \u201cAt first I tried to phone. I was on the line for an hour but then gave up and came down here. They have told me that it will be sorted out in 48 hours from today, but I don\u2019t know what to believe.\u201d Douglas, a university student, was worried if there would be any money in his account by the end of the week: \u201cI have been trying to pay in a cheque, which needs to clear by Friday. They can\u2019t tell me when the money will be through. All they could do was give me a receipt and promise that they will try to put it through later. But I need that money by Friday.\u201d Meanwhile Tara, who is self-employed, was visiting the bank to sort out her VAT. \u201cI can\u2019t get access to my account and I can\u2019t make any payments. I\u2019ve now got my VAT payment due, and I can\u2019t get any documents to give to my accountant. But they were pretty helpful inside the branch. They\u2019ve said they will email the documents over, and that if I am hit with aVAT fine because of this, they\u2019ll pay it.\u201d At the cash machines outside the branch Cathy was closely studying her printed account balance after taking out some cash. \u201cI don\u2019t actually do internet or mobile banking, so this hasn\u2019t really affected me. To be honest I wish they had made a mistake and accidentally deposited \u00a313,000 into my account.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that millions of pounds of bonuses to senior TSB staff were dependent on this IT migration. These bonuses were frozen after TSB was forced to delay the move, from Lloyds to its new owner Sabadell, last year. TSB\u2019s remuneration committee decided not to release the payments until later this year - presumably so they could ensure that the migration had taken place successfully. This included a bonus of over \u00a31m for CEO Paul Pester. The Times reported last month that the bank\u2019s workers were lobbying for the bonuses to be axed. They now have a stronger case... Sunday Times news editor Becky Barrow is also unimpressed with Pester - and vowing to move her account ASAP... Paul Pester has told the BBC that TSB\u2019s online banking service is being taken offline in an attempt to fix its problems - as he tweeted earlier. Apparently things should be a lot better by this evening... TSB CEO Paul Pester is taking a hoofing on Twitter from customers, whose patience over the IT problems is being stretched to breaking point. One, Kerrie Britton, reports that her TSB bank card isn\u2019t working. A cobbling and key cutting firm in Hoxton, East London, says that several customers haven\u2019t been able to use their cards either: Other customers are determined to hold Pester to his promise that \u2018no-one will be left out of pocket\u2019 From seeing unknown transactions to not being able to complete a house purchase, readers have been in touch with us about their experiences with TSB. Samantha from Doncaster logged in yesterday only to find the account she was looking at was not her own: \u201cYesterday morning I could see I had \u00a3200 more than what I should have. After logging off and then on again I could see the transactions were completely different to mine. After getting to work and checking the cash machine my account balance was shown at \u00a30 and then 20 minutes later \u00a3245 - all these amounts were wrong. By the evening my accounts had vanished and now I am unable to get back in. Luckily I took cash out on Friday but it is disgusting! All I can do is hope that someone is not looking at my account like I was looking at theirs. I tried to call TSB yesterday and got an automated person speaking and then the phone went dead.\u201d Claire in Bristol is worried the purchase of her first home will fall through: \u201cOur agreement in principle was arranged over the phone last Tuesday, but it has not yet arrived and the mortgage team at TSB said they cannot access our file due to the IT crisis. We tried over the phone and in branch and no one can get us a copy. If we don\u2019t have one by the end of the day we will no longer be accepted to purchase our home.\u201d Andrew, 44, who is a company director in Selby has had enough and is looking at moving his accounts: \u201cBoth my current account and savings accounts are held with TSB and not having access to these funds is both frustrating and very disappointing. Having been a loyal customer for over 15 years despite various campaigns from other banks offering better products and services this latest problem is the final straw and I\u2019ve completed the paperwork to move all my accounts to First Direct. If I cannot trust TSB to provide me with secure access to my accounts why should I leave my funds with them?\u201d You can tell us about your experience here. Financial analyst John Cronin of Dublin-based stockbrokers Goodbody says TSB has \u201cbotched\u201d its long-awaited decoupling from Lloyds\u2019s IT systems. Cronin says: TSB finally cut the last of its links to Lloyds last weekend, completing its separation from the group\u2019s technology systems. Services for customers were limited over the weekend as the migration was completed. However, it is apparent that the disruption continued into Monday with customers still complaining about various issues on Monday afternoon. Based on a review of customer complaints on Twitter, we found that several customers are alleging data breaches \u2013 with some customers noting their ability to access other customer\u2019s funds. Cronin thinks the mess could hamper TSB\u2019s efforts to tap a \u00a3825m pot of government fund set up to help \u2018challenger banks\u2019 win customers. If you\u2019ve been affected by TSB\u2019s online banking failure and would like to share your experiences, anonymously if you prefer, then please do so via the form here. Your responses will only be seen by the Guardian and we\u2019ll feature some of your responses in our reporting. Liberal Democrat peer Paul Scriven is not impressed with Paul Pester\u2019s explanations; he\u2019s planning to move to his money elsewhere: BREAKING: Nicky Morgan, the chair of Parliament\u2019s influential Treasury committee, is demanding answers from TSB over the chaos at its online banking systems following its IT migration. Morgan has written to CEO Paul Pester to ask three key questions: What exactly has gone wrong? What is the extent of the failure? How will TSB compensate customers, especially those who have suffered a breach of potentially highly-sensitive personal data. Morgan has excoriated TSB for its failings, saying the bank needs to provide answers - and restore services fast. She has also vowed to involve the City watchdog -- which further increases the chances that TSB will be fined over this debacle. As Morgan puts it: \u201cThe reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers\u2019 accounts, and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown. \u201cThis is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money. \u201cWarm words and platitudes will not suffice. TSB customers deserve to know what has happened, when normal services will resume, and how they can expect to be compensated. \u201cI will be writing to the FCA in due course for their assessment.\u201d Breaking: TSB\u2019s chief executive Paul Pester has FINALLY commented on the IT problems that are gripping his bank. Pester has tweeted that he\u2019s \u2018deeply sorry\u2019 for the mess, and revealed that TSB have decided to take their online banking system offline! That\u2019s an attempt to fix the problems created by last weekend\u2019s migration to new IT systems., That means that TSB customers are going to face fresh disruption today. Pester has also pledged that no customer will be left out of pocket -- which sounds like a promise to pay compensation to anyone who suffers financial damage from his fiasco. Many TSB customers fear they will fail to make important payments, or go overdrawn, because they can\u2019t access their bank accounts today. Joanna Walters of Preston is one: Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, says the bank has fallen short of what\u2019s acceptable - and should compensate anyone who loses out. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating times TSB customers this morning, especially those waiting to pay their staff or their bills. \u201cTSB are not the only bank to have these issues and our banks really need to pull their socks up because this keeps happening again and again. It\u2019s really not good enough when so many customers are being encouraged to bank online. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying when your bank can\u2019t keep on top of their IT systems and can cause lots of other problems if payments aren\u2019t made or funds aren\u2019t available. We hope that TSB customers wouldn\u2019t be left out of pocket as a result of these issues.\u201d A TSB spokeswoman has told us that the bank still doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s gone wrong with the IT upgrade. And she did not know how long it would take to fix the problems, which have affected millions of customers.... Shares in TSB\u2019s parent company, Banco Sabadell, dropped by 1% in early trading in Madrid. Yesterday Sabadell proudly announced that the \u201cProteo4UK migration\u201d was a success, indeed a new milestone in the company\u2019s history. The project has moved TSB away from its legacy IT systems at Lloyds Banking Group (which spun TSB off in 2013) and onto shiny new kit. The move is meant to save around \u00a3160m per year -- money that could be put towards customer compensation and fines... TSB\u2019s website has been regurgitating some remarkable error messages: [The \u2018beans\u2019 refer to objects coded in Java, the programming language used in many web applications] TV historian Guy Walters has been bitten by TSB\u2019s IT gremlins: TSB could be hit with hefty fines for this IT fiasco, potentially running into many millions of pounds. There is precedent. Back in 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed a \u00a342m penalty on Royal Bank of Scotland after it suffered IT problems that prevented customers from accessing their accounts. The FCA tells us: \u201cWe are aware of the issue and liaising with the firm.\u201d The City watchdog can also censure a firm and take action against individuals by fining or banning them from working in the City. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) are also looking into the problems, and could fine TSB over the data breaches that meant some people saw the wrong account details when they logged in. TSB\u2019s customer service team say they still can\u2019t provide any timescales about when these \u2018intermittent\u2019 problems will be resolved, but they\u2019re working as fast as possible to fix them. That\u2019s the same message that they were tweeting out yesterday - so it can\u2019t be much comfort for those affected. Small business owners are also suffering from the problems with TSB\u2019s online banking: Amanda Verbaan-Dunn, who owns the Wilton Hotel in Blackpool, says she can\u2019t currently pay her staff\u2019s wages: Nurse Gayle Elder of the Royal London Hospital found herself caught up in the chaos: BBC journalist Simon Read has spotted a surge in people reporting problems at TSB this morning: TSB customer Paul Bartlett reports that the system was working....but now it isn\u2019t again. Claire Hobson and Natalie Mansfield simply want answers - and access to their money. TSB customers are turning to social media again this morning, after finding they still can\u2019t access their accounts. Many, such as compliance manager Mary Marsden, have found that TSB\u2019s systems no longer accept their login details - suggesting that the migration to new IT systems has been bungled. The IT move began on Friday night, so some customers have been without banking services for several days. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK challenger bank TSB is embroiled in what looks like one of the biggest systems failures to hit a British bank in many years. Some online customers have been unable to access their money since TSB migrated its systems to a new platform over the weekend, and there have even been instances wher customers have seen other people\u2019s accounts. As we live-blogged last night, TSB customers have been pleading for help - worried that bills won\u2019t be paid and important transactions could be missed. TSB has apologised - a lot! - but still hasn\u2019t said when everything will actually be fixed. Currently, it says there is \u2018limited access\u2019 to its online banking; it was meant to come back online by 6pm Sunday night. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports on the situation this morning: Up to 1.9 million TSB mobile and internet banking customers remained unable to access their accounts for a fifth day on Tuesday after a botched IT upgrade over the weekend. The transfer of banking data has plunged the bank into turmoil, with some customers saying they had rogue credits and debits on their accounts while others said they had been given access to random accounts. Angry customers flooded social media with complaints, some saying they were unable to pay their mortgages or access any cash. Many called for compensation from the bank. One TSB customer, Matthew Neal, who wanted to check how much he had spent at the pub on Sunday night, told the BBC he had access to someone else\u2019s \u00a335,000 savings account, \u00a311,000 ISA and a business account when he logged into his account on Monday night. A TSB spokesperson said: \u201cWe are currently experiencing large volumes of customers accessing our mobile app and internet banking which is leading to some intermittent issues with people accessing our services. We are really sorry for the inconvenience this is causing our customers and want them to know we are working as hard and as fast as we can to resolve this problem.\u201d We\u2019ll be tracking the situation at TSB through the day - please get in touch in the comments below if you\u2019re affected. Also coming up today.... we get new data on the German business climate, Britain\u2019s public finances, and the state of America\u2019s housing market.

      "bodyText": "It will be no consolation to those TSB customers suffering under the botched IT \u201cupgrade\u201d that the bank had originally planned to do the work last November when, one assumes, it would have been even more badly prepared. Its chief executive, Paul Pester, said at the time that the \u201cmain reason\u201d for the delay was the approach of a likely rise in interest rates, which indeed materialised. TSB, supposedly, didn\u2019t want to leave itself unable to offer mortgage quotes over a crucial weekend. The explanation sounded thin at the time \u2013 more so now. Those who have watched Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s labours with IT over the years know these major transfers of data on to a new platform rarely run smoothly. Maybe TSB suspected it needed more time. But, if one takes Pester\u2019s line at face value, it could be that TSB was now in a hurry to press the button. The next rate rise could arrive next month and it would be embarrassing to miss another window for \u201cmigration\u201d. Whatever the thinking, TSB and its Spanish parent, Sabadell, were plainly working under financial incentives to move quickly. Pester put the cost of the original delay at \u00a370m and one can understand his calculations. Under the terms of its separation from Lloyds Banking Group in 2014, TSB effectively pays rent to use its old IT system. The cost of this \u201ctransitional service agreement\u201d soared last year from \u00a391.8m to \u00a3214m, according to the 2017 accounts. Delay, in effect, was costing \u00a310m-plus a month. \u201cWe would never rush if we didn\u2019t think we were ready,\u201d said TSB. Banking and data regulators will want to test that statement in detail. As it is, Sabadell\u2019s declaration on Monday that it had \u201csuccessfully completed\u201d the transition and achieved \u201ca new milestone\u201d was complete nonsense. FCA chief vents his frustration over Brexit talks One of the easier areas for Brexit negotiators to reach agreement about, you might assume, would be financial services. This is territory where \u2013 on day one, at least \u2013 the EU probably has more to lose than the UK. After all, as the governor of the Bank of England has put it many times, the UK is \u201cthe banker for Europe\u201d. There are cost benefits for EU companies and governments in having bond-clearing, equity underwriting and currency trading concentrated in London. In a messy divorce, costs of capital would probably increase. It is alarming, therefore, to hear Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, vent his frustration about how slowly talks are progressing. His speech on Tuesday made a strong technical case for why a regulatory system based on \u201cmutual recognition\u201d is better than the EU\u2019s current \u201cequivalence\u201d regime. But his main message was that the talks need to speed up. The crucial passage was this: \u201cWhile it is necessary to have unilateral actions in place for the UK, this is nonetheless a distinctly second best solution to the UK and the EU authorities working together to deal with the risks. Let\u2019s get on with it, please.\u201d Bailey was being polite. It is safe to assume that, behind that \u201cplease\u201d, lies deep frustration among UK regulators, coupled with incredulity that EU authorities seem reluctant to talk about a permanent arrangement before a transitional deal is settled. These talks are clearly not going well. Broadband upstart CityFibre falls into Goldman\u2019s hands It\u2019s a shame to see CityFibre depart from the stock market. This interesting upstart, with the potential to become a serious irritant to BT Openreach in full fibre broadband, is being bought by a couple of infrastructure investment funds, including one managed by Goldman Sachs, for \u00a3538m. The takeover price represents a 93% premium to Monday\u2019s share price, so was virtually impossible for CityFibre\u2019s board to resist. Its founder and chief executive, Greg Mesch, though, argues that private ownership brings benefits in its own right in the form of committed capital and 10-year thinking. Let us hope he is right. CityFibre has signed a 20-year partnership with Vodafone and is aiming to provide a full fibre service to 20% of the UK market by 2025. If those roll-out plans are realised, BT Openreach would face stiffer competition and be obliged to pull its finger out. It is uncomfortable for the nation to have to rely (in part) on Goldman Sachs for faster broadband sooner \u2013 but that\u2019s where we are.",

The cost of this \u201ctransitional service agreement\u201d soared last year from \u00a391.8m to \u00a3214m, according to the 2017 accounts. Delay, in effect, was costing \u00a310m-plus a month.</p> <p>\u201cWe would never rush if we didn\u2019t think we were ready,\u201d said TSB. Banking and data regulators will want to test that statement in detail. As it is, Sabadell\u2019s declaration on Monday that it had \u201csuccessfully completed\u201d the transition and achieved \u201ca new milestone\u201d was complete nonsense.</p> <h2>FCA chief vents his frustration over Brexit talks</h2> <p>One of the easier areas for Brexit negotiators to reach agreement about, you might assume, would be financial services. This is territory where \u2013 on day one, at least \u2013 the EU probably has more to lose than the UK.</p> <p>After all, as the governor of the Bank of England has put it many times, the UK is \u201cthe banker for Europe\u201d. There are cost benefits for EU companies and governments in having bond-clearing, equity underwriting and currency trading concentrated in London. In a messy divorce, costs of capital would probably increase.</p> <p>It is alarming, therefore, to hear Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, vent his frustration about how slowly talks are progressing. His speech on Tuesday made a strong technical case for why a regulatory system based on \u201cmutual recognition\u201d is better than the EU\u2019s current \u201cequivalence\u201d regime. But his main message was that the talks need to speed up.</p> <p>The crucial passage was this: \u201cWhile it is necessary to have unilateral actions in place for the UK, this is nonetheless a distinctly second best solution to the UK and the EU authorities working together to deal with the risks. Let\u2019s get on with it, please.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey was being polite. It is safe to assume that, behind that \u201cplease\u201d, lies deep frustration among UK regulators, coupled with incredulity that EU authorities seem reluctant to talk about a permanent arrangement before a transitional deal is settled. These talks are clearly not going well.</p> <h2><strong>Broadband upstart CityFibre falls into Goldman\u2019s hands</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s a shame to see CityFibre depart from the stock market. This interesting upstart, with the potential to become a serious irritant to BT Openreach in full fibre broadband, is being bought by a couple of infrastructure investment funds, including one managed by Goldman Sachs, for \u00a3538m.</p> <p>The takeover price represents a 93% premium to Monday\u2019s share price, so was virtually impossible for CityFibre\u2019s board to resist. Its founder and chief executive, Greg Mesch, though, argues that private ownership brings benefits in its own right in the form of committed capital and 10-year thinking.</p> <p>Let us hope he is right. CityFibre has signed a 20-year partnership with Vodafone and is aiming to provide a full fibre service to 20% of the UK market by 2025. If those roll-out plans are realised, BT Openreach would face stiffer competition and be obliged to pull its finger out. It is uncomfortable for the nation to have to rely (in part) on Goldman Sachs for faster broadband sooner \u2013 but that\u2019s where we are.</p>",

The handful of Toys R Us stores that were still trading closed their doors for the final time on Tuesday, ending the US retailer\u2019s three-decade presence in the UK. The toy chain, which had 3,200 staff and 100 stores, went into administration in February. The restructuring company Moorfields failed to find a buyer. Tough trading conditions have also scuppered East, which had 50 stores and collapsed in January. Its restructuring company, FRP Advisory, was also unable to find a buyer. The retailer\u2019s 314 staff are likely to lose their jobs. An FRP Advisory spokesperson said: \u201cAfter exploring opportunities to agree a sale of all or parts of the business, we have been unable to secure a buyer to date. \u201cCurrently, East Lifestyle Limited is due to cease trading on 4 May, with all employees being made redundant.\u201d On Tuesday, House of Fraser\u2019s parent company, Sanpower, confirmed it was in talks to sell a controlling stake to another Chinese group, C.banner International Holdings, which owns the toy chain Hamleys. Last month, the Sanpower subsidiary that owns House of Fraser said it was in talks to sell a 51% stake to Wuji Wenhua, a Chinese leisure group. Sanpower, controlled by Yuan Yafei, one of China\u2019s richest men, acquired 89% of House of Fraser via its department store arm, Nanjing Cenbest, in 2014. The group had promised to invest in the British chain, but the financial backing it has provided has not been enough to prevent House of Fraser from struggling. In a statement released via the Hong Kong stock exchange, the two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding. C.banner said investing in House of Fraser would help it expand overseas and there would be collaborations with its existing footwear and toy retail companies. The department store chain said the proposed share sale would have no impact on day-to-day operations, declaring: \u201cIt is business as usual.\u201d",

Shareholder Royal London Asset Management had said ahead of Tuesday\u2019s annual meeting that it would vote against Vernon Hill\u2019s re-election as chairman after the bank paid \u00a34.5m last year to Shirley Hill\u2019s firm InterArch for design and marketing services.

At the meeting, held at the bank\u2019s offices in London, where a portrait of Hill, his wife and their dog hangs prominently by the reception desk, shareholders representing more than 96% of the votes cast backed Hill. All other resolutions were also passed overwhelmingly. Only 12 shareholders were in attendance, with neither Royal London \u2013 which owns 0.44% of Metro Bank \u2013 nor Glass Lewis present.

      "bodyText": "BP\u2019s chief executive has come under fire from campaigners after he urged Cambridge University not to drop its fossil fuel investments. Bob Dudley was greeted with laughter when he told an industry conference on Tuesday: \u201cWe donate and do lots of research at Cambridge so I hope they come to their senses on this.\u201d His comments came a week after he launched BP\u2019s climate change strategy, which involves expanding into clean energy and capping carbon emissions. \u201cThese [divestment] efforts are coming out of the US, the east coast and west coast, and New York, and it is generally the simplified idea that we turn everything into renewables \u2013 that climate change will be solved by renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you dig into it and look into the numbers, of course, it can\u2019t work. You\u2019ve got to get more sophisticated about it.\u201d Divestment campaigners reacted angrily and said Cambridge\u2019s academic freedom was at risk. Cambridge Zero Carbon Society, which is lobbying the university to ditch its estimated \u00a3377m investment in fossil fuels, said: \u201cBP\u2019s mask slipped to reveal the ugliness lying beneath. \u201cMr Dudley\u2019s outrageous threat is just another sign of an industry desperately clinging on to power, knowing its only chance for survival is to subvert democracy at universities like Cambridge and leech off their reputation.\u201d Cambridge has previously rejected calls to divest from fossil fuel companies, arguing it is better to engage with them. But the university has faced renewed pressure from hundreds of academics to rethink the direction of its \u00a36.2bn endowment fund \u2013 the biggest of any UK university. BP donated \u00a322m to fund an institute at Cambridge that has nearly 40 staff working on how to maximise oil and gas extraction.

      "bodyText": "An IT meltdown at TSB is causing chaos for millions of customers.The TSB chief executive, Paul Pester, has apologised, but that may not be enough. Amid reports of people losing out on property purchases or being stranded without money on the continent, senior politicians are now demanding answers. What went wrong? Problems started to emerge on Monday morning, following a planned IT upgrade scheduled for between 4pm on Friday 20 April and 6pm on Sunday 22 April. Customers had been warned that online banking would be unavailable between these times, as would most mobile banking, while branches and phone banking would offer a limited service, and payments and money transfers would also be affected. But, hours after the work was supposed to be finished, the bank was bombarded with complaints from customers unable to log on. Some customers also said the upgrade had left them with rogue credits and debits, while others complained they had been given access to random accounts. How many customers are affected? TSB has about 5 million customers, though of that number, about 1.9 million are active mobile and internet banking users. The bank said they suffered \u201cintermittent\u201d failures to access their accounts, while a glitch gave some users a view of \u201cnominee\u201d accounts they would not normally see. Have they sorted it out yet? No. TSB said on Tuesday it was \u201cstill seeing issues with access to our digital services\u201d. However, the deluge of unhappy customers complaining on Twitter would suggest that that is putting it mildly. Many remain locked out of their accounts and unable to make payments. However, some customers said they were able to make payments with their debit card and withdraw cash from ATMs as usual. Nicky Morgan MP, the chair of the Commons Treasury committee, said the incident had \u201call the hallmarks of an IT meltdown\u201d. What is TSB doing about all this? The bank said on Tuesday it was taking its online banking and mobile app down \u201cfor a few hours,\u201d adding: \u201cWe hope to be back up later this afternoon. We\u2019ll let you know as soon as it\u2019s available again.\u201d Why was it conducting an upgrade in the first place? TSB was carved out of Lloyds Bank and then bought in 2015 by Spain\u2019s Banco Sabadell. Initially, Lloyds continued to handle the IT infrastructure for TSB, but this upgrade was about moving 1.3bn customer records over to a \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d banking platform called Proteo4UK, designed by Sabadell. Will I be compensated? TSB said: \u201cCustomers can rest assured that no one will be left out of pocket as a result of these service issues.\u201d So that should mean people will be compensated if, for example, they incur late payments fees because they are not able to make a payment. Keep any receipts/paperwork, and visit a branch or call the bank and explain that you want to reclaim your money. Will TSB be penalised? It could prove an expensive business for the bank. Following Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s June 2012 IT meltdown that left some people locked out of their accounts for days on end, the banking group paid out a total of \u00a370.3m compensation to UK customers - including businesses - and \u00a3460,000 to individuals and companies who were not customers, but were affected by the problems. However, RBS is a much bigger bank, and this earlier incident \u2013 which did not include a planned upgrade \u2013 involved 10% of the UK population: at least 6.5 million customers. In that incident, the disruption suffered by most of those affected lasted for six days, though it was 20 days for large numbers of Ulster Bank customers. Why do these banking meltdowns keep happening? You\u2019re right \u2013 there have been quite a number in recent years. RBS seems to have more than other banks \u2013 it had another big one in December 2013, with customers unable to use their debit cards or log in to internet or mobile banking. Part of the problem, according to many experts, is that many retail banks have complicated legacy systems that have arguably become unwieldy as a result of being added to and meddled with following mergers and takeovers. The addition of a proliferation of new payment technologies such as contactless payment and Apple Pay, plus the need for all these different systems to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other, has added further pressure. This latest upgrade involved TSB migrating vast amount of customer data from the banking platform it rented from Lloyds to its own platform.",

    "webTitle": "Boost for Hammond as budget deficit hits lowest level since 2007", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s budget deficit has dropped to the lowest level since before the financial crisis, laying the ground for Philip Hammond to raise government spending on public services later this year. The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing, excluding the state-owned banks, dropped by \u00a33.5bn to \u00a342.6bn in the last financial year, cutting the budget deficit to the lowest level since the year ending March 2007. The shortfall between how much the government spends and receives in tax was \u00a32.6bn lower than that forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Although the figures will be finalised later this year, the government\u2019s spending watchdog said lower-than-expected local authority borrowing helped to explain much of the difference. The figures come after the chancellor used the spring statement last month to suggest there could be spending increases in the next budget should the public finances continue to improve. Hammond has faced sustained pressure from Labour and some MPs in his own party to increase public sector pay after years of austerity. There are also calls to raise spending to soften the blow from Britain leaving the EU. The OBR forecasts the deficit will fall to \u00a337.1bn this year, around a quarter of what the government borrowed between March 2009 and April 2010 at the peak of the financial crisis. Hammond seized on the figures on Tuesday, saying: \u201cThanks to the hard work of the British people, borrowing is the lowest in over a decade. Our economy is at a turning point with debt starting to fall and people\u2019s wages rising, as we build an economy that truly works for everyone.\u201d But after years of austerity, economists questioned whether the strength of the UK economy was the driver for cutting the deficit, while political opponents argue the cuts have severely damaged the public sector. Samuel Tombs at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \u201cLow borrowing [is] not indicative of a reviving economy.\u201d Stripping out capital spending, the country\u2019s current budget last year was in surplus by \u00a3112m, marking the first positive reading since the financial year ending in March 2002. On this measure the public finances returned to levels considered normal for the first time since before the financial crisis, while they also would meet the so-called \u201cgolden rule\u201d for spending set by Gordon Brown. This called for governments to borrow only to invest in the economy. John Hawksworth, the chief economist at the accountancy firm PwC, said the key challenge facing Hammond was how to \u201ctrade off growing political pressure to ease austerity against his desire to get the debt ratio down as far as possible before the next economic downturn hits\u201d. He said: \u201cThe undershoot in the deficit this year has given the chancellor a little more wriggle room, but it does not alter the fundamental strategic choice he will need to make in November.\u201d",

Samuel Tombs at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \u201cLow borrowing [is] not indicative of a reviving economy.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stripping out capital spending, the country\u2019s current budget last year was in surplus by \u00a3112m, marking the first positive reading since the financial year ending in March 2002. On this measure the public finances returned to levels considered normal for the first time since before the financial crisis, while they also would meet the so-called \u201cgolden rule\u201d for spending set by Gordon Brown. This called for governments to borrow only to invest in the economy.</p> <p>John Hawksworth, the chief economist at the accountancy firm PwC, said the key challenge facing Hammond was how to \u201ctrade off growing political pressure to ease austerity against his desire to get the debt ratio down as far as possible before the next economic downturn hits\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe undershoot in the deficit this year has given the chancellor a little more wriggle room, but it does not alter the fundamental strategic choice he will need to make in November.\u201d <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK has been powered without coal for three days in a row, setting a new record and underlining the polluting fuel\u2019s rapid decline. Coal has historically been at the cornerstone of the UK\u2019s electricity mix, but last year saw the first 24-hour period that the the country ran without the fuel since the 19th century. New records were broken last week when zero power came from coal for nearly 55 consecutive hours. That milestone in turn was smashed on Monday afternoon and the UK passed the 72-hour mark at 10am on Tuesday. The coal-free run came to an end after 76 hours. Without the fossil fuel, nearly a third of Britain\u2019s electricity was supplied by gas, followed by windfarms and nuclear on around a quarter each. The rest came from biomass burned at Drax power station in North Yorkshire, imports from France and the Netherlands, and solar power. Drax said it expected to go without coal on Tuesday. The coal-free records are a reversal from the recent highs that coal plant owners experienced during the so-called \u201cbeast from the east\u201d cold snap. During cold weather in February and early March, demand for gas to use in heating pushed up the price of gas for power, which brought coal power stations online. However, overall power demand is now much lower following the recent warm weather, making it easier for gas, renewables and nuclear to cover much of the UK\u2019s needs. National Grid has forecast electricity demand this summer will be lower than last year, with minimum demand at 17GW and peak at 33.7GW. Demand on Tuesday is expected to peak at about 35GW. Experts said to expect more milestones this year. \u201cEver rising renewable capacity in the UK will see these records fall more and more frequently, clearly showing progress made over the past decade or two,\u201d said Jonathan Marshall, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. However, one observer cautioned that the shift away from coal could be a \u201cfalse dawn\u201d if it was just replaced by gas. Andrew Crossland, who tracks electricity generation on the MyGridGB site, said: \u201cShifting to gas is likely to make our electricity market more volatile as our energy price becomes increasingly locked to international gas markets. That will only hurt consumers.\u201d A carbon tax, the cheaper price of gas and the rise of renewables have all hit coal operators. The government has set a deadline of October 2025 for phasing out coal entirely. Two coal plant owners have said they will shut this year, which will leave the UK with six coal power stations including Drax, which has hinted it will cease burning coal before the 2025 target.",

It is the seventh year running that Vodafone has come bottom of the consumer group\u2019s annual survey of how happy the UK public is with their mobile operator. Utility Warehouse, the energy and communications company, was named as the firm with the happiest mobile customers. Vodafone had the worst customer score (49%) \u2013 a combination of satisfaction and likelihood to recommend to a friend \u2013 with one in six customers (16%) saying they would not recommend the company to a friend or family member.
