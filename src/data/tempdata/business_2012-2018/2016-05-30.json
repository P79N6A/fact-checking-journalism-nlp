      "bodyText": "Deloitte has named its highest-ever proportion of female partners in the accountancy firm\u2019s annual round of promotions but the pool of senior employees is still more than 80% male. The \u2018big four\u2019 accountant said 24 of 80 new partners in its UK business, which includes offices in Switzerland, are female. The figure means that 30% of the prized positions went to women, up on last year\u2018s 29% and just 20% in 2014. But while the proportion of new female partners has been increasing, Deloitte is still a long way off gender parity. This year\u2019s intake means that just 16% of the 1,054 partners in the firm\u2019s UK division are female, a slight increase on 15% before the latest batch of promotions. Deloitte says that just 10% of new partners are not white, below the 13% of the population who identified as being non-white in the 2011 census. But 10% represents an improvement, given that the existing group of partners is only 4% non-white. David Sproul, the chief executive and senior partner, hailed the firm\u2019s progress on gender diversity, saying: \u201cWe have seen a second consecutive year of strong female representation amongst Deloitte\u2019s new partners.\u201d But he admitted that the company had further to go to close the gender gap among partners: \u201cAchieving greater gender diversity is a clear business imperative and these promotions evidence the success of the range of initiatives we have put in place.\u201d Sproul pointed to company initiatives such as its return-to-work programme aimed at recruiting women who have been out of the workplace for two years or more. He said the scheme was likely to \u201cfurther boost our pipeline of future partner candidates\u201d. More than half of the participants on last year\u2019s return-to-work scheme accepted a job with the company and the programme has been expanded to 20 women this year. Deloitte has also backed programmes designed to make working hours more flexible and started using mobile phone games to test the aptitude of job applicants, a process it says makes its recruitment process more egalitarian by removing \u201cunconscious bias\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "UK companies have become gloomier about their trading prospects and the economic outlook as the EU referendum approaches, according to a survey. Lloyds Bank\u2019s latest barometer of business mood found confidence about trading prospects dipped to a three-year low in May. Overall business confidence and hiring plans were also down, according to the survey of about 200 companies with a turnover of more than \u00a31m. The poll comes alongside a separate figures showing a dip in job vacancies and advertised salaries in May. Together the reports will add further fuel to the debate over whether the EU referendum is hurting business confidence or whether other factors are at play that will persist beyond the vote in June. Lloyds said a net balance of 32% of firms polled were feeling more confident, down from 38% in March and 45% at the start of the year. The drop in confidence was most marked in medium-sized companies with a turnover of between \u00a35m and \u00a320m. For all sizes of company, the net balance reporting an improvement in trading prospects fell 11 points on the month to a three-year low of 38%. There was also a drop in the net balance of firms expecting to increase staff levels. Other recent polls have indicated that some businesses have deferred hiring and investment decisions until after the 23 June referendum, and the Bank of England has said those jitters will knock economic growth this quarter. The findings from Lloyds echo that. Hann-Ju Ho, a senior economist for Lloyds Bank commercial banking, said: \u201cOur May survey shows a second consecutive monthly fall in overall sentiment, suggesting that economic growth may slow further in the second quarter due to near-term economic risks. \u201cDespite this, overall confidence remains above the level in February of this year with increased resilience across our industrial sector and among larger firms.\u201d Separate figures from the jobs search engine Adzuna point to a slowdown in pay and new job opportunities. The total number of advertised jobs in April dipped 0.3% from March to 1,156,810. That figure, however, was still up 12% on a year earlier. The site, which aims to list every job on offer in the UK, noted a particular deterioration in job prospects for new graduates. There were 12,850 entry-level jobs advertised in April this year, down 8% on a year earlier, Adzuna said. The average entry-level salary dropped to a 30-month low of \u00a323,309. Adzuna also noted \u201cconcerns about the impact of April\u2019s new national living wage and the upcoming EU referendum could be responsible for this reduction in new roles\u201d. Its co-founder Doug Monro said: \u201cGraduate vacancies are falling and new joiners are facing one of the toughest job markets in recent times.\u201d",

The investment group, which manages \u00a33.4bn assets on behalf of its clients, said it was yet to received a detailed proposal from RIT about how the two listed companies might combine, but a tie-up would create a firm worth about \u00a35bn, with Alliance worth \u00a32.6bn and RIT valued at \u00a32.4bn.

      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover sold half a million cars for the first time ever in the past year, helped by strong demand in Europe and North America. However, the UK\u2019s largest car manufacturer, owned by Indian conglomerate Tata, saw pre-tax profit fall as customers opted for cheaper models and it suffered a slowdown in the lucrative Chinese market. JLR sold 521,571 cars in the year to the end of March, a 13% rise on the previous 12-month period. The increase, boosted by the popularity of new models such as the Jaguar XE, delivered a \u00a3342m rise in revenues to \u00a322.2bn. Despite the soaring sales, pre-tax profits dropped from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a31.56bn. This included the \u00a3157m cost of an explosion in the Chinese port of Tianjin last August, which forced the company to write off almost 6,000 vehicles. Profits were also affected by lower first-half sales in China \u2013 a market where JLR makes bigger profit margins than in western economies \u2013 and spending on new projects, such as a \u00a31bn engine factory in Wolverhampton. JLR is planning to invest about \u00a33.75bn this year to further expand production capacity, develop new technologies and manufacture models such as the Jaguar F-Pace and Range Rover Evoque Convertible. The company has doubled vehicle sales and staff headcount over the past five years, overtaking Nissan to become the UK\u2019s largest car manufacturer by production. The growth represents a marked turnaround from 2009, when the company flirted with financial ruin following the banking crisis and subsequent recession.

      "bodyText": "When Bob Dylan went electric, he was infamously met with cries of \u201cJudas\u201d from wounded fans. Folding bicycle maker Brompton will be hoping to avoid the same accusation from its legions of suited and booted commuter devotees when it too \u201cgoes electric\u201d. From next year, the business plans to start producing fold-up electric bicycles aimed at people who find pedalling too much like hard work. The new bikes employ pedelec technology, which stores energy from pedalling and releases it when the rider reaches a hill. The Brompton system has been developed in partnership with Formula One team Williams and is a slimmed down version of the Kers (kinetic energy recovery system) technology that racing cars use to gain extra speed. \u201cThe guy on his \u00a32,500 carbon-frame road bike will wonder why you\u2019re cruising past him in a suit,\u201d said Will Butler-Adams, the chief executive of Brompton. The move into electric bicycles is part of an ambitious global expansion plan orchestrated from a gleaming new factory in the west London suburb of Greenford. At 84,000 sq ft, the floorspace of the site is bigger than the pitch at Wembley Stadium and four times the size of Brompton\u2019s previous home. The move cost the company about \u00a32m, a sum equal to its pre-tax profit in 2015, achieved on turnover of \u00a327.5m. While the factory itself is shiny, new and packed with new technology, the work that goes on here hinges on some old-fashioned craftsmanship. Abdul El Saidi, 56, is Brompton\u2019s brazing manager. He is responsible for passing on the decades-old craft, which is similar to welding, to new trainees. All 250 staff, from the engineers to the receptionists, have to try their hand at brazing when they start work at the business. . For new recruits the stakes are high \u2013 all have their initials stamped on individual bike components for the sake of quality control. But the money isn\u2019t bad either. A new brazer can expect a starting salary north of \u00a330,000, partly because it isn\u2019t easy to find people suited to such a job. \u201cNot many people know about brazing, which was a problem for Brompton,\u201d said El Saidi, who demonstrates the steady hand, patience and eye for detail required for a top brazer. \u201cTechnology has taken over engineering and welding jobs so there\u2019s not much training. In the 1970s when I started, there were full classes of people learning to weld. It was big money. But if I lost my job here, there\u2019s not a job elsewhere. The world has changed a lot.\u201d If El Saidi\u2019s story of industrial decline sounds like a familiar tale of Britain\u2019s diminishing place in global manufacturing, Brompton is at least bucking the trend. About 80% of its bikes are exported to 44 markets. Two of the largest markets are Germany and South Korea, often held up as shining examples of export-led economies. The working practices at Brompton feel like a cosy reminder of days long past, with the production line staffed by people rather than robots. Do any of them own a Brompton, given that the machines start at a cool \u00a3785? \u201cNah, I\u2019ve got a Ferrari,\u201d joked one of Brompton\u2019s bike makers, as he screwed in a crucial component. Every member of the production line staff is responsible for a different part of the bike and between them they can assemble one in about three and a half minutes. Their target for the year is 47,500 and the company is soon to add a second production line in the belief it can roll out 100,000 bikes a year by 2022. To do so, it will need to use all of the tools at its disposal. Although the bicycles help people to save on public transport, they could not be described as cheap, and at 9.5kg are technically portable but not for a long period of time. \u201cYou have to have ambition,\u201d said Butler-Adams. \u201cThere are more than a billion people in China. Not all of them are going to ride a Brompton but there\u2019s an opportunity there. \u201cMost people in the world have never seen one [a Brompton] but globally there is net migration to cities and they\u2019ve got the same challenges with space and lack of exercise.\u201d While China represents an opportunity, it will not be easy to break into the market. Working-class Chinese cannot afford one of the costly machines, while many among the burgeoning middle classes see cycling to work as beneath them. But since founder Andrew Ritchie first developed a folding bike in 1975 \u2013 naming it after the Brompton Oratory church across the road from his flat \u2013 the company has defied its critics. It has also developed a cult following, as evidenced by fan groups such as the London Brompton Club page on Facebook, which has 2,800 members. There are even competitions for who can fold one up the quickest - the record is 5.6 seconds. \u201cThere are Brompton owners who are tall, small, old, young. We don\u2019t give a stuff,\u201d said Butler-Adams. \u201cThe flipping thing works. If it works in London, it can work all over the world.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Gordon Ramsay eyes first UK restaurants outside London", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gordon Ramsay is looking to open his first UK restaurants outside London for over a decade after the celebrity chef\u2019s company increased sales and narrowed losses. Ramsay is considering potential sites in Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham. He is also set to open three new restaurants in the US over the next 12 months, including a chippy in Las Vegas called Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Fish &amp; Chips. The US restaurants will extend Ramsay\u2019s partnership with Caesars Palace, the casino operator with which he already operates four outlets in the US. Stuart Gillies, the chief executive of the Gordon Ramsay Group (GRG), said he wanted to open a first restaurant in a major regional city within 18 months. \u201cWe are looking at properties in Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds. There\u2019s a great dining scene there and we are just considering what the options are,\u201d he said. Gillies declined to say which of Ramsay\u2019s formats might migrate north, but the company has been expanding Maze Grill, its upmarket chain, and Kitchen, which offers casual dining. The only UK restaurant Ramsay has opened outside London was Amaryllis, in Glasgow, in 2001 but it closed in 2004. The new sites would be GRG\u2019s first openings in the UK for more than a year. GRG operates 14 restaurants in London and holds the license for 15 more around the world. Sales for Kavalake, GRG\u2019s holding company, rose 12.6% to \u00a350.3m in the year to 31 August 2015 after it opened new sites in Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore, France and the US, and two new Maze Grill restaurants and Heddon Street Kitchen in London. Despite the increase, Kavalake recorded its third year of operating losses, although they narrowed from \u00a31.5m in the previous year to \u00a31m. Kavalake remained in red after a \u00a34m bill for legal costs relating to a fallout with Rowan Seibel, Ramsay\u2019s business partner in the Fat Cow, a Los Angeles restaurant which closed in 2014. Kavalake\u2019s debts stood at a chunky \u00a321.5m, including a \u00a314.2m loan from Ramsay himself, although that is down from \u00a324.3m a year before. The company said the legal costs did not include Ramsay\u2019s dispute with his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, who managed Ramsay\u2019s companies until the chef sacked him and his son Adam on the grounds of \u201cgross misconduct\u201d in 2010. Last January the chef lost a case in which he accused Hutcheson of using a ghostwriter machine \u2013 commonly used by authors to sign books and photographs automatically \u2013 to forge his signature on a document that made him the personal guarantor for the \u00a3640,000 annual rent of a London pub. Gillies said he expected the group to return to profit in the current year, with the various legal disputes finally coming to an end. \u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable we will be back in the black,\u201d he said. \u201cOur forecasts look to be on target and there is nothing in the woodwork on litigation and that is great news after years under that cloud.\u201d Gillies said the group was likely to open more restaurants in London, but he did not put a time scale on expansion. \u201cWe are glad to be in London in this period. There is more competition, but the more operators that come in they raise the level of quality. Certain restaurants will go but that\u2019s the nature of business because the quality should remain. London is the capital of the world for quality and creativity.\u201d He said that if Britain were to vote to leave the EU it would make life tougher for restaurateurs because many staff come from outside the UK. Big groups such as GRG have the resources to cope with any change, he said, but Brexit could mean that small family restaurants struggle to compete for staff, adding to the pressure already caused by the introduction of the government\u2019s new minimum wage for over-25s, the so-called national living wage.",

      "body": "<p>Gordon Ramsay is looking to open his first UK restaurants outside London for over a decade after the celebrity chef\u2019s company increased sales and narrowed losses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gordonramsay\">Ramsay</a> is considering potential sites in Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham. He is also set to open three new restaurants in the US over the next 12 months, including a chippy in Las Vegas called Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Fish &amp; Chips. The US restaurants will extend Ramsay\u2019s partnership with Caesars Palace, the casino operator with which he already operates four outlets in the US.<br></p> <p>Stuart Gillies, the chief executive of the Gordon Ramsay Group (GRG), said he wanted to open a first restaurant in a major regional city within 18 months. \u201cWe are looking at properties in Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds. There\u2019s a great dining scene there and we are just considering what the options are,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Gillies declined to say which of Ramsay\u2019s formats might migrate north, but the company has been expanding Maze Grill, its upmarket chain, and Kitchen, which offers casual dining.</p> <p>The only UK restaurant Ramsay has opened outside London was Amaryllis, in Glasgow, in 2001 but it closed in 2004.</p> <p>The new sites would be GRG\u2019s first openings in the UK for more than a year. GRG operates 14 restaurants in London and holds the license for 15 more around the world. </p> <p>Sales for Kavalake, GRG\u2019s holding company, rose 12.6% to \u00a350.3m in the year to 31 August 2015 after it opened new sites in Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore, France and the US, and two new Maze Grill restaurants and Heddon Street Kitchen in London.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Despite the increase, Kavalake recorded its third year of operating losses, although they narrowed from \u00a31.5m in the previous year to \u00a31m. </p> <p>Kavalake remained in red after a \u00a34m bill for legal costs relating to a fallout with Rowan Seibel, Ramsay\u2019s business partner in the Fat Cow, a Los Angeles restaurant which closed in 2014.</p> <p>Kavalake\u2019s debts stood at a chunky \u00a321.5m, including a \u00a314.2m loan from Ramsay himself, although that is down from \u00a324.3m a year before.</p> <p>The company said the legal costs did not include Ramsay\u2019s dispute with his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, who managed Ramsay\u2019s companies until the chef sacked him and his son Adam on the grounds of \u201cgross misconduct\u201d in 2010. <br></p> <p>Last January <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/20/gordon-ramsay-court-battle-pub-rent\">the chef lost a case in which he accused Hutcheson of using a ghostwriter machine</a> \u2013 commonly used by authors to sign books and photographs automatically \u2013 to forge his signature on a document that made him the personal guarantor for the \u00a3640,000 annual rent of a London pub.</p> <p>Gillies said he expected the group to return to profit in the current year, with the various legal disputes finally coming to an end. \u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable we will be back in the black,\u201d he said. \u201cOur forecasts look to be on target and there is nothing in the woodwork on litigation and that is great news after years under that cloud.\u201d</p> <p>Gillies said the group was likely to open more restaurants in London, but he did not put a time scale on expansion.</p> <p>\u201cWe are glad to be in London in this period. There is more competition, but the more operators that come in they raise the level of quality. Certain restaurants will go but that\u2019s the nature of business because the quality should remain. London is the capital of the world for quality and creativity.\u201d</p> <p>He said that if Britain were to vote to leave the EU it would make life tougher for restaurateurs because many staff come from outside the UK. Big groups such as GRG have the resources to cope with any change, he said, but Brexit could mean that small family restaurants struggle to compete for staff, adding to the pressure already caused by the introduction of the government\u2019s new minimum wage for over-25s, the so-called national living wage.</p> <p></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A furious row has broken out after the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) refused to disclose the arrangement with EDF for dealing with radioactive waste at the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The information commissioner\u2019s office has turned down a freedom of information (FoI) request for state aid arrangements between the UK and the European commission to be made public. The FoI complainant, David Lowry, has launched an appeal, claiming it is in the public interest for British citizens to be able to judge whether their government had made the right decision about the new reactors in Somerset. Lowry, a British-based senior research fellow with the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in the US, said: \u201cI do not believe the balance of judgment should be in favour of a foreign company, EDF Energy, who will potentially make huge multibillion-pound financial gain from the continued non-disclosure, and hence non scrutiny, over myself as a British tax and electricity bill payer.\u201d The government said that anyone building new reactors in Britain must manage and pay for the cost of handling waste products, unlike the existing situation where all radioactive materials are effectively dealt with through the public purse via the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. However, although the operator must agree to take responsibility for the spent fuel and other radioactive waste, the cost is expected to be passed on to the domestic electricity user through higher bills. Under the new arrangements, the prospective nuclear operators must enter into a waste transfer contract (WTC). Those contracts, like the one covering Hinkley, must be submitted for scrutiny by the EC under its state aid rules. It is the pricing methodology of the WTC that Lowry wished to review and which remains under wraps. Greenpeace said Lowry raised critical issues that went to the heart of whether the \u00a318.5bn project was good or bad value for the taxpayer and British energy consumers. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace, said: \u201cThe government has repeatedly said that Hinkley is great news for the British public and our energy security. But they refuse to back this up with hard evidence. In fact, DECC is incredibly cagey and is failing to answer questions on where the dangerous radioactive waste will go or how much Hinkley will cost us. \u201cIf Hinkley is such a good deal, it should be no problem for the government to release the information to prove it. Their failure to do so leaves us to believe that their assumptions are correct - it\u2019s a terrible deal for bill payers and they simply don\u2019t know what to do with the nuclear waste.\u201d DECC turned down the original request under regulation 12(5)(a) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 arguing, \u201cdisclosure would adversely affect international relations, defence, national security or public safety\u201d. This argument was accepted by the information commissioner who believed that disclosure of the state aid discussions with the EC \u201cwould adversely affect the relationship between the (UK) government and the commission\u2019s ability to work effectively together\u201d. The information commissioner acknowledged that there were \u201cstrong public interest arguments in favour of disclosure\u201d but he believed there was a stronger argument for protecting the confidentiality of the material. Lowry said he thought the real reason the government did not want to disclose the information was to save ministers from embarrassment. \u201cI think the concern is if the truth were to come out with documents being made public would adversely affect the credibility of the government submissions as their threadbare content would be laid bare for all to see,\u201d he said. DECC declined to comment, saying it was a matter for the information commissioner.",

      "bodyText": "The property tycoons and advisers who backed Dominic Chappell\u2019s BHS takeover are set to face questions from MPs over their involvement with the department store chain. The influential parliamentary committees investigating the collapse of BHS will consider calling Guy and Alexander Dellal, who control Allied Commercial Exporters (Ace), when MPs return from recess next week. They could also summon David Roberts of the law firm Olswang and Paul Martin at the accountancy firm Grant Thornton again. Ace provided Chappell with the \u00a335m needed to show Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group that he was a credible buyer for BHS, then made millions of pounds from a series of property deals and loan agreements with the retailer. Roberts and Martin advised Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, on the takeover of BHS and they were due to appear in front of MPs last week. Instead they sent stand-ins who did not work directly on the deal and failed to answer many of the questions MPs posed, sparking anger on the committee. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership. Green owned the retailer for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a collection of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received millions of pounds of payments and loans from BHS during its 13-month ownership of the business. MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and the work and pensions committee are investigating BHS\u2019s demise. They have already heard from Arcadia executives, pension trustees and advisers who worked on the sale of the company to Retail Acquisitions. Chappell is scheduled to appear before MPs on 8 June, and Green a week later. The administrator Duff &amp; Phelps is still in talks with a Portuguese-backed consortium about a rescue deal for BHS and its 11,000 workers. The consortium is led by Greg Tufnell, the former managing director of Mothercare and Burton, and the brother of the former England cricketer Phil Tufnell. Tufnell is working alongside Nick de Scossa, a Swiss-based banker, and Jos\u00e9 Maria Soares Bento. They have told administrators that a wealthy Portuguese family is backing their bid and willing to invest tens of millions of pounds in BHS. An announcement about a rescue deal is likely on Wednesday or Thursday. If a deal is not struck this week, liquidators are likely to be appointed, meaning BHS\u2019s 164 shops around the country would close down.",

      "bodyText": "If you feel as if you need a holiday to recover from your Memorial Day holiday weekend, the odds are that you spent at least part of it in a US airport, along with an estimated 2.5 million other Americans. More specifically, you probably spent it dealing with the Transportation Security Administration, aka the TSA. Perhaps you posted Twitter or Instagram photos of dystopian-style scenes, as passengers showed up four or five hours ahead of time for a three-hour flight, still unable to make it through security checkpoints. If you listen to the politicos and TSA officials talk, it\u2019s all about keeping us safe. Which is true, to an extent: if we don\u2019t visibly take protective measures, we might as well issue an engraved invitation to terrorists to board a plane of their choice. But the dysfunctional way in which those security measures are implemented, wasting thousands of hours nationwide, boils down to money: a cash-starved TSA and a cash-rich airline industry. More specifically, it is tied to the way that the economic interests of government and the airlines conflict with ensuring that the TSA system is run smoothly and efficiently. Add to the mix the fact that airline passengers shoulder a higher proportion of the costs of this system than we did when the TSA was created, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and you have a recipe for passenger misery. It\u2019s a recipe we can\u2019t do anything about, because it is dependent on the spending behavior of the other two players, the government and the airlines. Government \u2013 in the form of the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 has for years been depriving the TSA of the resources it needs. As the number of passengers and flights leaving US airports has grown, the number of TSA officials screening travelers has dropped. Describing last year\u2019s budget as \u201caustere\u201d, the TSA has predicted that its shrinking workforce will have to cope with a 20% jump in travelers this year. Clearly, the TSA is no great shakes at its job, failing to identify concealed mock weapons in 67 of 70 test cases nationwide last year. But at least some of the agency\u2019s problems might be traced to financial constraints. In spite of the surge in air travel, it faces a cap on the number of new officers it is allowed to hire. That means it can only hire part-timers, whose morale is likely to be lower and whose turnover is demonstrably higher \u2013 about 20% annually. Nor are TSA agents paid the same way as other federal employees, meaning they typically collect lower salaries. And yet passengers foot the bill for the vast majority of security screening \u2013 along with other flying-related costs, like customs and immigrations inspections \u2013 through travel fees and taxes. Indeed, since September 2014, as well as standing in line and suffering the actual physical inspections, we have been the only ones to pay for them. That was when the Department of Homeland Security relieved airlines of the burden of paying for screening passengers and their luggage, only to transfer that to the passengers, when fees at least doubled. That saved the airlines $357m a year \u2013 and is expected to pull in $4.3bn from ordinary travelers. You know, the same travelers who are generating hefty profits for airlines by paying fees for checking their baggage, to have a printed boarding pass or even to sit together as a family, to avoid leaving a three-year-old stranded at the other end of the plane. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if all that money was actually going to the TSA. But it isn\u2019t. Under the terms of a bipartisan agreement to avert a government shutdown back in 2013, 60 cents out of the $5.60 security fee we pay for every segment we fly \u2013 and if you change planes in Chicago, en route from San Francisco to New York, that could end up being two segments, depending on the length of your layover \u2013 doesn\u2019t go to the TSA. It goes to the Treasury, to pay down the national debt. This year, the TSA will lose about $1.25bn in resources that could have gone to open more lines at O\u2019Hare and recruit and pay (properly) some full-time screeners. The TSA would like us to pay still more in fees. To be specific, the agency has waged an all-out PR campaign to get us to spend $85 (and submit to a background check, fingerprints and all) and join TSA PreCheck, a group of low-risk air travelers who can use \u201cfast track\u201d security lanes. No belt removal, no laptop removal, no shoe removal required. Only 2.7 million Americans have done so \u2013 disappointing the TSA\u2019s hopes of enlisting 25 million and reaping a rich new source of fees. I understand why. For starters, business class travelers often are automatically cleared for the PreCheck security lane. And with ticket prices already rising, why not just plan to get to the airport a little earlier? Meanwhile, PreCheck simply won\u2019t be a valid option for the vast majority of American families. Even if the idea of doing a security check on three school-aged kids weren\u2019t absurd to the point of being offensive, the cost of getting five family members their PreCheck clearances (even if they are valid for five years) is an extra expense very few could afford. Especially when the reason for doing so would be that the government is mismanaging the agency\u2019s finances already. Meanwhile, the airlines are doing just fine. In fact, as far as they are concerned, there really isn\u2019t a problem at all, is there? Or if there is, it\u2019s really just about TSA inefficiency. As for the airlines, well, thanks to all the fees they are collecting from passengers, US carriers reported a latest jump in profits to an astonishing $25.6bn in 2015. That\u2019s up threefold from 2014, and marked six consecutive years of growth in earnings, the longest such gain since airline deregulation in 1978. The decline in jet fuel costs helped, but so did the soaring revenue from checked bags. But the hefty fees \u2013 as much as $75 apiece \u2013 that we now must pay to get a piece of luggage to its destination are contributing to the TSA\u2019s woes. As airlines have introduced those fees, logically enough we have tried to dodge them, packing more and more into larger and larger \u201ccarry on\u201d bags, making screening longer and more problematic. The airlines operate under a mandate of maximizing their profits, so collecting those luggage fees and ensuring that the passengers foot the bill for the security costs is in their interest. But it\u2019s not going to contribute to the smooth running of the airports, or, in the long term, the airlines. Airports can send out miniature therapy horses and therapy dogs to reduce stress levels among waiting passengers, but that\u2019s not a solution. Nor is privatization. It\u2019s hard to see how much room there would be for the kinds of benefits that privatization traditionally does bring, such as innovation. The TSA would continue to dictate screening standards, for instance, so how much room would there be for new practices to emerge? The budget wouldn\u2019t change. Unfortunately, private contractors couldn\u2019t pay more to recruit workers and thankfully, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to pay still less than the $35,000 or so a full-time worker now makes. Those airports that do use private contractors to screen for the TSA tend to be much smaller than the giants like O\u2019Hare or Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield Jackson, where the problems have been concentrated. Moreover, there have been smaller airports that are not privatized that have had better-than-average experiences, like Boston\u2019s Logan. This is a problem caused by the uneven flow of money, and it can only be resolved by addressing that. Stop asking passengers to pay the monetary price in fees and extra fees and then in waiting time and hassle, because of decisions made by airline executives and politicians. Ensure that the TSA has the resources that it needs \u2013 and for which travelers already are paying. Suggest that airlines devote 10% of the revenue collected from the fees we pay to check our first bag to enhancing TSA screening resources or, alternatively, to funding the cost of TSA PreCheck applications for families traveling in the summer, when crowds are at their peak. Certainly, if we don\u2019t devise some kind of solution, air rage soon won\u2019t be safely confined to a single plane 30,000 feet overhead, but will sweep through an entire airport terminal full of infuriated would-be holidaymakers.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) meets on 2 June, questions are rising about the oil cartel\u2019s continuing relevance. Many Opec members have suffered as the oil price has collapsed and countries, most notably Saudi Arabia and Iran, have fought to retain market share rather than set prices by adjusting production. Crude-oil prices briefly fell under $30 a barrel for both Brent and West Texas Intermediate earlier this year, but have rebounded, with values touching $50 for Brent Thursday. Unarguably the price war has hurt the US shale industry as many Opec members had wanted. Increased demand because of the low prices is adding to their optimism that the price war has worked. The higher prices mean oil producers can breathe a little easier, although even at $50 those prices aren\u2019t making money. Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said Opec\u2019s mission to grab market share is working. Opec can say that the fundamental outlook is improving and that there isn\u2019t much they need to do to balance the market, he added. Opec isn\u2019t expected to change their stated quota of is 31.5m barrels a day, although it is routinely pumping extra 1m barrels daily above target. The two biggest producers, Saudi Arabia and Iran, are likely to stand firm on their production goals. Iran has repeatedly said it wants to return to the previous output levels it had prior to the west\u2019s sanctions on its nuclear activity. Saudi Arabia is unlikely to cut its daily output of about 9.5m barrels since other Opec members are also overproducing. \u201cExpectations are that there will be no agreement. There won\u2019t suddenly be a coming of minds between Saudi Arabia and Iran ... But it\u2019s a consensus group and there\u2019s no consensus to do anything,\u201d said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citi Research. The lack of consensus has many in the oil market questioning whether Opec remains relevant any more, especially as non-Opec producers like the US are a big part of the global oil market now. \u201cMy thought has been that Opec has less control over oil prices than they have any time in the past 40 years. And circumstances emerged that make it very difficult for them to agree on pricing policy because of what has resulted from investments over the last decade,\u201d Morse said, referring to shale-oil production from hydraulic fracturing. John England, vice-chairman, US and Americas oil and gas leader for Deloitte, said the global oil surplus created by Opec overproduction and US shale output left Opec in a tricky position. \u201cSuppliers have more power in times of scarcity. Right now we\u2019re perceived to be in a time of abundance in terms of oil supply ... The inability to reach consensus has limited their ability to impact the market the way they have in the past. So I think they\u2019ve been less relevant,\u201d England said. But Opec is not dead, he adds, noting they have weathered commodity cycles before. Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank, agreed that for now the cartel seems obsolete, but when total supply and demand become balanced, Opec may become important again. A balanced market could happen by year\u2019s end, they said. US production is forecast to fall 8.5% this year from 2015\u2019s record level of 9.4m barrels daily, the US Department of Energy\u2019s statistical arm, Energy Information Service, said. By 2017, EIA forecasts output will be down 13% from 2015\u2019s high because of lower prices brought on by the supply glut. The EIA sees the excess global supply reaching 1m barrels a day this year, but falling to 200,000 in 2017 as consumption rises and supply falls. Because of falling US production and rising demand, analysts lifted their oil-price forecasts, with Commerzbank estimating average 2016 Brent and WTI prices at $50, and Citi in the mid-$50s for Brent. Even with more global oil players, Melek dismissed ideas that Opec is no longer relevant. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve made statements that they\u2019re pursuing market share and these types of polices have made them incredibly important. They\u2019ve moved the market. It\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t see the prices go up, we saw them go down. It doesn\u2019t diminish their power,\u201d he said. 2 June will be the first meeting for Khalid al-Falih, the new Saudi oil minister. He is unlikely to deviate from the current market-share policy, as Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown price Mohammed bin Salman seems to be calling the shots with his recently announced Vision 2030 plan for the kingdom to move away from oil dependency. \u201cSaudi Arabia doesn\u2019t want to become a failed petrostate. That\u2019s the stated objective, to find a way for the economy to prosper, even in a low-price environment,\u201d Morse said. That means Saudi Arabia may want to pump as much as it can as it transforms its economy. \u201c(If) you can see the end of the life of petroleum in the world economy, then maximizing production makes sense because the more you hold oil in the ground, the less value it will have over time,\u201d he said. Opec may have won the latest price war but with even Saudi Arabia thinking of a life beyond petroleum, its future looks far from certain.",

But it\u2019s a consensus group and there\u2019s no consensus to do anything,\u201d said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citi Research.</p> <p>The lack of consensus has many in the oil market questioning whether Opec remains relevant any more, especially as non-Opec producers like the US are a big part of the global oil market now. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/saudi-arabia-approves-ambitious-plan-to-move-economy-beyond-oil\">Saudi Arabia approves ambitious plan to move economy beyond oil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy thought has been that Opec has less control over oil prices than they have any time in the past 40 years. And circumstances emerged that make it very difficult for them to agree on pricing policy because of what has resulted from investments over the last decade,\u201d Morse said, referring to shale-oil production from hydraulic fracturing.</p> <p>John England, vice-chairman, US and Americas oil and gas leader for Deloitte, said the global oil surplus created by Opec overproduction and US shale output left Opec in a tricky position.</p> <p>\u201cSuppliers have more power in times of scarcity. Right now we\u2019re perceived to be in a time of abundance in terms of oil supply ... The inability to reach consensus has limited their ability to impact the market the way they have in the past. So I think they\u2019ve been less relevant,\u201d England said. </p> <p>But Opec is not dead, he adds, noting they have weathered commodity cycles before.</p> <p>Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank, agreed that for now the cartel seems obsolete, but when total supply and demand become balanced, Opec may become important again.</p> <p>A balanced market could happen by year\u2019s end, they said. US production is forecast to fall 8.5% this year from 2015\u2019s record level of 9.4m barrels daily, the US Department of Energy\u2019s statistical arm, Energy Information Service, said. By 2017, EIA forecasts output will be down 13% from 2015\u2019s high because of lower prices brought on by the supply glut. </p> <p>The EIA sees the excess global supply reaching 1m barrels a day this year, but falling to 200,000 in 2017 as consumption rises and supply falls. </p> <p>Because of falling US production and rising demand, analysts lifted their oil-price forecasts, with Commerzbank estimating average 2016 Brent and WTI prices at $50, and Citi in the mid-$50s for Brent.</p> <p>Even with more global oil players, Melek dismissed ideas that Opec is no longer relevant. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve made statements that they\u2019re pursuing market share and these types of polices have made them incredibly important. They\u2019ve moved the market. It\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t see the prices go up, we saw them go down. It doesn\u2019t diminish their power,\u201d he said.</p> <p>2 June will be the first meeting for Khalid al-Falih, the new Saudi oil minister. He is unlikely to deviate from the current market-share policy, as Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown price Mohammed bin Salman seems to be calling the shots with his recently announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/saudi-arabia-approves-ambitious-plan-to-move-economy-beyond-oil\">Vision 2030</a> plan for the kingdom to move away from oil dependency.</p> <p>\u201cSaudi Arabia doesn\u2019t want to become a failed petrostate. That\u2019s the stated objective, to find a way for the economy to prosper, even in a low-price environment,\u201d Morse said.</p> <p>That means Saudi Arabia may want to pump as much as it can as it transforms its economy. </p> <p>\u201c(If) you can see the end of the life of petroleum in the world economy, then maximizing production makes sense because the more you hold oil in the ground, the less value it will have over time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Opec may have won the latest price war but with even Saudi Arabia thinking of a life beyond petroleum, its future looks far from certain. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Scientists funded by Cancer Research UK who spend their lives hunting for cures for the disease are among thousands of academics whose pensions are invested in the tobacco industry, the Guardian can reveal. The latest annual report for the university staff\u2019s pension fund shows it had \u00a3211m invested in British American Tobacco in the year to 31 March 2015 \u2013 its fifth biggest listed equities holding. The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) \u2013 the official name for the fund for university academics and staff \u2013 was worth \u00a349bn in 2015. The BAT holding is not the only controversial investment; its biggest holding was \u00a3344m in Royal Dutch Shell. But the tobacco investment will come as a shock to many researchers, academics and staff. One scientist, who is employed by a leading university but whose post is funded by CRUK, was horrified to learn that her money was being invested in this way. \u201cThis means that, even if only indirectly through our time and labour, CRUK money is being invested in growing and supporting the tobacco industry,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe idea that we all have our pension invested in BAT is outrageous. \u201cAll the work of this institute is done under the guidance of CRUK, and we are, quite rightly, regularly reviewed to ensure that CRUK money is being spent effectively and efficiently in the global fight against cancer. How can this possibly be in line with the fact that most of us will retire comfortably on money earned from tobacco investments?\u201d Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors and principals, said USS was a responsible investor. \u201cUSS, as part of its investment duties, takes into account wider social, ethical, and environmental and governance issues, so long as that ensures that the assets of the scheme are invested in the best financial interests of members and their beneficiaries,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cUSS is also a responsible and engaged investor. They have, for example, undertaken engagement with tobacco companies on marketing approaches and regulations around e-cigarettes.\u201d But public health campaigners say it is not possible to reform the tobacco industry. In March, the European Public Health Association called on investors to dump their holdings. \u201cFor decades, it has actively sought to mislead the world about the harms caused by its products. It has corrupted public officials, been complicit in illicit activities such as smuggling, and has undermined legislation to protect the health of the public,\u201d said the association in a statement. It praised the campaigning organisation Tobacco Free Portfolios in Australia, which had successfully argued for pension funds to disinvest in tobacco. Prof Martin McKee, the president of the EUPHA, said it was calling on European institutional investors such as USS to follow suit. \u201cGiven the hard work of so many of its members to eliminate the scourge of tobacco-related death and misery, it is simply unacceptable that USS should continue to invest in this discredited industry,\u201d he said. CRUK, some of whose money indirectly ends up in BAT, said the university pension arrangements were not under its control. It is now supporting Tobacco Free Portfolios in the UK. George Butterworth, CRUK\u2019s tobacco policy manager, said: \u201cThe tobacco industry\u2019s deadly products are responsible for one in four cancer deaths. Many people would be shocked to learn that their pensions are invested in tobacco company shares \u2013 especially those striving to develop cures for diseases caused by this lethal industry. Cancer Research UK\u2019s own pension funds are tobacco-free, but many of our researchers are based at institutions where that is not the case. \u201cTo help make it easier for organisations\u2019 pension schemes to opt out of tobacco shares, we\u2019re now funding the UK arm of Tobacco Free Portfolios to encourage investment funds to divest from tobacco stocks. AXA\u2019s move earlier this week to withdraw billions in investment from the tobacco industry shows what can be done.\u201d USS said in a statement that it was \u201can active and responsible shareowner, an approach which USS\u2019s trustee believes will protect and enhance the long-term value of the fund. In order to ensure appropriate diversification we invest in a wide range of companies and assets. \u201cWe have a significant in-house responsible investment team and work with the companies in which we invest to improve ethical, environmental and governance standards, in the best financial interest of our members and beneficiaries. In recent times, this has included engaging with tobacco companies on marketing approaches and regulations around e-cigarettes. The trustee keeps its approach under review.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The debate on negative gearing policy is heating up with a clear line drawn in the sand by Liberal and Labor. The Liberals argue that Labor will scrap (grandfather) negative gearing on existing dwellings which will cause house prices to fall and rents to rise. Labor have hit back, saying the changes would not impact prices and tenants would not have to pay more. The challenge for most Australians is to sift the fact from fiction because on this issue there a lot of half-truths. First, negative gearing has not prevented house prices from crashing in a whole host of regional towns leaving negatively geared middle-income Australians in, or on the brink of foreclosure and bankruptcy. Neither has it prevented the highly speculative Sydney housing market from going into reverse. According to the Domain Group, the median house price in the city is roughly $50k less today than it was just six months ago. That is a significant drop which leaves many negatively and highly geared investors who bought properties in the last six months with interest-only financing in a seriously challenging predicament should the housing market not recover. Despite the RBA dropping interest rates (citing low inflation in the real economy), the banking system is seemingly struggling to figure out how they will be able to comfortably finance the new army of investors and owner occupiers when the tsunami of off-the-plan apartments due for completion later this year need to be paid for with minimal collateral and maximum debt from the buyer. The analytical data suggests that in a small handful of suburbs across our major cities, a growing number of investors and first-time homebuyers (that took out incredibly high loan-to-value ratio loans, or used an existing asset as collateral rather than a cash deposit) now hold a mortgage under water. For example, in Caringbah in south Sydney median house prices have fallen from $1.06m six months ago to $895,000 now (a fall of $110k). So let\u2019s say an investor borrowed a typical 90% of the value of that median-priced home \u2013 $900,000k \u2013 on an interest-only mortgage. If the investor had to offload their property asap, they would be left $5,000 underwater just on the mortgage, not to mention the 10% deposit. Deduct say $15-$18,000 for estate agent commissions and then add legal fees and other costs and the borrower would be somewhere between $20-$30,000 short. Add $44,000 to the debt pile if the borrower also had to borrow the stamp duty on top of this. You are already looking at somewhere between $20k-$74,000 in liabilities and costs that must be paid once the property is sold. Under the Liberal economic theory on negative gearing, this should not be happening. But it is. And there is nothing worse than leveraging several times your income to invest in an asset that costs you money to hold whilst it depreciates in value. Taking away negative gearing for the purchase of an existing dwelling \u2013 as Labor plans to do \u2013 would significantly restrict investors\u2019 ability to acquire larger sums of debt at the expense of other taxpayers. This means that investors will have to scale back the size of their loans and will therefore have less purchasing power and less ability to pay a speculative premium for properties, creating more of a level playing field in the market. The big difference between renting and buying a house is that you cannot borrow to rent. Australians can currently borrow significant and artificially large sums of debt to purchase an investment property and run it at a loss on the assumption by the borrower and the banks lending them the money that house prices will continue to rise. Hence, when assessing supply and demand, the rental market is a more realistic reflection of real supply and demand. There is some evidence that Labor\u2019s changes could cause house prices to fall until investing in real estate earned an income (positively geared). But there is little evidence to suggest that it would cause rents to rise. And no evidence whatsoever that landlords have the power to demand steep rises in rent from their tenants in an already lacklustre rental market. If you are a renter paying $450 per week and negative gearing were scrapped and your landlord asked you to pay an extra $200 per week to cover his or her losses, would you pony up the extra dough or tell the landlord to go find a new tenant in this very well supplied rental market? And let\u2019s not forget the all the cranes towering over our major cities, helping to build more homes than this country needs. This will undoubtedly put even more pressure on landlords to drop their rent in order to compete with an incredibly large cohort of new property investors (many of which will be negatively geared) coming into an already saturated market later this year. So whilst politicians are arguing and fibbing about repercussions of grandfathering negative gearing, we have to ask ourselves, what is best for the next generation of Australians when it comes to housing affordability and securing their financial future? Does today\u2019s model where a nurse must borrow six to fifteen times her median income to secure one single home or investment property that will earn no weekly net-income even sound logical? And why would any politician endorse this colossal scale of risk?",

This means that investors will have to scale back the size of their loans and will therefore have less purchasing power and less ability to pay a speculative premium for properties, creating more of a level playing field in the market.</p> <p>The big difference between renting and buying a house is that you cannot borrow to rent. Australians can currently borrow significant and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/how-australian-households-became-the-most-indebted-in-the-world\">artificially large sums of debt </a>to purchase an investment property and run it at a loss on the assumption by the borrower and the banks lending them the money that house prices will continue to rise. Hence, when assessing supply and demand, the rental market is a more realistic reflection of real supply and demand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/11/australia-bet-the-house-on-never-ending-chinese-growth-it-might-not-end-well\">Australia bet the house on never-ending Chinese growth. It might not end well</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is some evidence that Labor\u2019s changes could cause house prices to fall until investing in real estate earned an income (positively geared). But there is little evidence to suggest <a href=\"http://www.corelogic.com.au/news/largest-annual-falls-in-advertised-weekly-rents\">that it would cause rents to rise</a>. And no evidence whatsoever that landlords have the power to demand steep rises in rent from their tenants in an already lacklustre rental market. If you are a renter paying $450 per week and negative gearing were scrapped and your landlord asked you to pay an extra $200 per week to cover his or her losses, would you pony up the extra dough or tell the landlord to go find a new tenant in this very well supplied rental market?</p> <p>And let\u2019s not forget the all the cranes towering over our major cities, helping to build more homes than this country needs. This will undoubtedly put even more pressure on landlords to drop their rent in order to compete with an incredibly large cohort of new property investors (many of which will be negatively geared) coming into an already saturated market later this year.</p> <p>So whilst politicians are arguing and fibbing about repercussions of grandfathering negative gearing, we have to ask ourselves, what is best for the next generation of Australians when it comes to housing affordability and securing their financial future?<br></p> <p>Does today\u2019s model where a nurse must borrow six to fifteen times her median income to secure one single home or investment property that will earn no weekly net-income even sound logical? And why would any politician endorse this colossal scale of risk?</p>",
