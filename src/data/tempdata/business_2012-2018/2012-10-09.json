In a speech at the London School of Economics marking 20 years since the Thatcher government switched the focus of Britain's economic policy to battling inflation, the outgoing governor gave a robust defence of the Bank's performance in the runup to the crash in 2007, insisting that tweaking interest rates alone could never have prevented it. Instead, he said the Bank should have been able to deploy \"macro-prudential\" tools, such as limits on how much risk banks could take on for a given level of assets \u2013 a so-called leverage cap, similar to the one that the government plans to impose when it implements the proposals of the Vickers commission. \"With hindsight, before 2007 there should have been a cap on the leverage of banks.

      "bodyText": "A dramatic flight of capital from struggling eurozone countries threatens to shrink bank assets by trillions of dollars, the IMF says in a report. Investors, fearing the collapse of the eurozone, have pulled their money out of the financial system at vital moments, making it difficult for governments and businesses to meet the challenge of generating consistent growth. IMF director Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als said: \"Faltering confidence and policy uncertainty have led to a pullback of cross-border private capital flows from the periphery \u2013 quite an extraordinary phenomenon within a currency union.\" The IMF calculated that total assets of EU banks could be forced to shrink by as much as $2.8tn, leading to a 9% reduction in credit. In an extreme scenario that figure could climb to $4.5tn. The IMF said eurozone policymakers have tried to give money markets some certainty, but it has proved inadequate and is encouraging flights of money from the periphery to northern Europe and to countries outside the currency union. The stock market has risen strongly since the summer, but the IMF is concerned the market could deflate if confidence evaporates. The authors of the report, Peter Dattels and Matthew Jones, said confidence in politicians has waned as each economic initiative fails to unite policymakers. A failure to tackle key financial decisions in Washington and Tokyo is also blamed for the increase in instability, but the governments are deemed less of a threat than the eurozone and are given years rather than months to sort out their problems. \"Despite significant and continuing efforts of European policymakers, which have been essential in addressing investors' biggest fears, the principal risk remains the euro area crisis,\" Dattels and Jones said. \"Incremental policymaking has been insufficient to fully allay market tensions, despite the recent market rally since the end of July.\" They said problems in the US and Japan could be tackled over the next few months, and that it was a priority to agree a way forward for the eurozone. The Washington-based lender has warned before that the world economy is under threat from an unstable financial system, while eurozone leaders fail to agree terms for bailouts and monetary easing. European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi has garnered praise for his efforts to protect weaker eurozone countries in case they come under attack from nervous investors. Spain, Italy and Portugal have enjoyed lower interest rates as a result of ECB actions that cut borrowing costs. These moves have helped stave off a run on the currency. But Draghi has come under constant fire from politicians in Germany, Finland and Holland for creating unlimited rescue funds that could, they believe, rebound on the ECB. Earlier this week German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he believed Spain would survive without rescue funds from Brussels, contradicting most investor groups and City analysts who believe Spain can only survive if it accepts support from the EU. The IMF's global stability report argues that badly indebted countries need more support to alleviate the pressure from investors and create an environment that fosters confidence and growth. It says that while decisions are delayed, the assets held by banks also come under question and shareholders flee to hold safer assets. Banks in the eurozone periphery are known to hold billions of euros of bad debts that have yet to be recognised on their balance sheets. UK, French and German banks are also vulnerable to a downturn in the eurozone through their shareholdings and joint ventures with local banks in the periphery.",

      "standfirst": "Deal to refinance gym and tennis club chain's \u00a3365m debt pile likely to cost tycoons Ian and Richard Livingstone millions", 
      "body": "<p>David Lloyd Leisure, one of Britain's largest gym and tennis club chains, is facing a painful refinancing of its towering \u00a3365m debt pile in a deal likely to wipe out millions invested by property tycoons Ian and Richard Livingstone.</p> <p>The business's debt burden is a legacy of a controversial takeover backed by Bank of Scotland just weeks before the credit crunch brought an abrupt end to a glut of leveraged buyout deals.</p> <p>The latest accounts for David Lloyd show the group's losses more than doubled from \u00a334.8m to \u00a382.2m last year. Meanwhile, the company's balance sheet sank further into the red, with the net deficit ballooning 75% to \u00a3189m \u2013 including \u00a326m of current liabilities.</p> <p>Directors insisted they were \"pleased with the performance\", noting that turnover had been broadly flat at \u00a3319m. The chain opened its 90th club, in Farnham, Surrey, last year and another opening in Worcester is scheduled for December.</p> <p>But a more gloomy picture emerged in the small print to the accounts. \"The current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly in relation to membership levels and property values.\"</p> <p>The directors warned that even after a string of cost cuts, the group, which employs 4,500 staff, will only narrowly stay within its banking covenants in the next 12 months. During that time it is keen to thrash out a debt restructuring before loan covenants tighten further.</p> <p>The business was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/04/retail?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">bought in August 2007</a> from leisure conglomerate Whitbread in a \u00a3925m joint venture backed by the Livingstone brothers and Bank of Scotland. The bank took an equity stake as well as providing the acquisition debt financing.</p> <p>The clubs were merged with Next Generation Clubs, a rival business run by Scott Lloyd, whose father \u2013 a former British tennis professional \u2013 had founded the David Lloyd chain that bears his name, selling it in 1995 to Whitbread.</p> <p>Ballooning balance sheet liabilities include \u00a3183m in loan notes held by the group's own shareholders. These notes attract interest at 13% a year, though the interest is rolled up and does not fall due until 2017. Before then, however, any refinancing deal with the group's banks is almost certain to see the value of these notes reviewed.</p> <p>The 2007 purchase of David Lloyd was one of the largest deals entered into by Peter Cummings's corporate banking division at Bank of Scotland, then part of HBOS.

      "bodyText": "David Lloyd Leisure, one of Britain's largest gym and tennis club chains, is facing a painful refinancing of its towering \u00a3365m debt pile in a deal likely to wipe out millions invested by property tycoons Ian and Richard Livingstone. The business's debt burden is a legacy of a controversial takeover backed by Bank of Scotland just weeks before the credit crunch brought an abrupt end to a glut of leveraged buyout deals. The latest accounts for David Lloyd show the group's losses more than doubled from \u00a334.8m to \u00a382.2m last year. Meanwhile, the company's balance sheet sank further into the red, with the net deficit ballooning 75% to \u00a3189m \u2013 including \u00a326m of current liabilities. Directors insisted they were \"pleased with the performance\", noting that turnover had been broadly flat at \u00a3319m. The chain opened its 90th club, in Farnham, Surrey, last year and another opening in Worcester is scheduled for December. But a more gloomy picture emerged in the small print to the accounts. \"The current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly in relation to membership levels and property values.\" The directors warned that even after a string of cost cuts, the group, which employs 4,500 staff, will only narrowly stay within its banking covenants in the next 12 months. During that time it is keen to thrash out a debt restructuring before loan covenants tighten further. The business was bought in August 2007 from leisure conglomerate Whitbread in a \u00a3925m joint venture backed by the Livingstone brothers and Bank of Scotland. The bank took an equity stake as well as providing the acquisition debt financing. The clubs were merged with Next Generation Clubs, a rival business run by Scott Lloyd, whose father \u2013 a former British tennis professional \u2013 had founded the David Lloyd chain that bears his name, selling it in 1995 to Whitbread. Ballooning balance sheet liabilities include \u00a3183m in loan notes held by the group's own shareholders. These notes attract interest at 13% a year, though the interest is rolled up and does not fall due until 2017. Before then, however, any refinancing deal with the group's banks is almost certain to see the value of these notes reviewed. The 2007 purchase of David Lloyd was one of the largest deals entered into by Peter Cummings's corporate banking division at Bank of Scotland, then part of HBOS. Just over a year later, however, crisis-stricken HBOS was effectively rescued from collapse in a takeover by Lloyds, with the taxpayer forced to take a 40% interest in the enlarged group. Cummings's division was the subject of an investigation by the Financial Services Authority after the enlarged bank \u2013 renamed Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 was forced to more than double its bad debt provisions from \u00a33.3bn to \u00a37bn. In March this year the regulator concluded the division had been guilty of \"very serious misconduct\". Last month Cummings, who has retired from banking, was fined \u00a3500,000 after being found to have led a \"culture of optimism\" at HBOS which left the bank slow to spot looming bad debts. After the gym club deal was signed, Andy Powell, the banker who led the Bank of Scotland's investment, said: \"We are delighted to be part of this landmark deal. This deal represents a fantastic opportunity to consolidate the two pre-eminent racquets, health and fitness clubs in the UK, creating a clear market leader in premium health and fitness.\" Lloyds Banking Group's distressed stake in David Lloyd Leisure was sold, along with a parcel of other investments from Cummings's Bank of Scotland division, to distressed debt group Coller Capital in a \u00a3332m deal two years ago. Powell still acts as an adviser on the David Lloyd investment, despite the bank having sold its interest. He also continues to sit on the David Lloyd Leisure board. His continue involvement stems from his role as a partner in Caird Capital, set up by fellow former Bank of Scotland banker Graeme Shankland, to advise on some of the bank's former investments.",

Among the mid-caps Greene King dropped 25.5p to 599p as analysts at Barclays moved from overweight to equalweight. But after Monday's disappointing update from Michael Page International, fellow recruiter Hays did better. The company's shares added 4.3p to 79.5p as it reported a better than expected 1% like for like fall in total net fees for the first quarter. The global performance was mixed, with Germany the star, up 25%. But fees from Asia Pacific fell by 9% and by a similar amount in the UK.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's struggling economy left recession in the third quarter of the year, expanding by a healthy 0.8% as it bounced back from the diamond jubilee shutdown, according to the latest estimates from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). In its monthly assessment of the outlook for GDP, NIESR suggested the economy expanded by 0.8% in the third quarter. That would mark the end of the double-dip downturn, and the strongest growth since mid-2010. However, NIESR stressed that the underlying rate of economic growth, stripping out the Olympics effect, and the rebound from the extra day's bank holiday in June, was far weaker, at 0.2-0.3%. \"The strength of the figure for the three months to September is largely an artefact of special events. Economic growth is expected to be at a significantly slower pace in the coming quarters,\" it said. The estimate is constructed using the latest official figures for industrial output, published on Tuesday, which showed a sharp contraction of 0.5% in August, after a stronger performance in July. Within that figure, manufacturing production shrank by 1.1% in the month. Analysts pointed out that the true strength of manufacturing is difficult to gauge, because of one-off factors such as longer than usual factory shutdowns during the Olympics. But they warned that the figures suggested growing weakness in the sector. Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, said: \"Although the monthly data can be volatile, slower underlying manufacturing growth will be of concern to policymakers and will be further ammunition for those MPC members arguing for more quantitative easing.\" A weak set of trade figures for the UK, also published on Tuesday, threw further doubt on the prospects for recovery. The trade deficit on goods widened to \u00a39.8bn in August, from \u00a37.3bn in July, with exports declining by 4% on the month. Analysts said this reflected the impact of slowing growth in the eurozone and other major economies. The downbeat news came after the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast for the UK economy and warned that George Osborne may have to revisit his deficit reduction plans if growth continues to disappoint. Chris Williamson, of data provider Markit, said: \"A batch of dismal data and a gloomier assessment of the economic outlook has cast a further dark cloud over the UK's economic health, piling pressure on the government to review its fiscal policy and growth strategy. The economy may still pull out of its recession in the third quarter, but a return to contraction in the fourth quarter cannot be ruled out, as the underlying growth momentum clearly remains extremely weak.\"",

      "body": "<p>London's largest initial public offering of the year has been launched, with Russian tycoon Alisher Usmanov's mobile operator MegaFon confirming it intends to float before Christmas.</p> <p>Usmanov \u2013 who is Russia's richest man, according to Forbes, and the second largest shareholder in Arsenal football club \u2013 is not selling any of his MegaFon holding in the float but has already enjoyed a multimillion-dollar payday this year. He was one of the early investors in Facebook and sold shares in its record $16bn IPO in May.</p> <p>Usmanov took control of MegaFon in April, buying out fellow tycoon Mikhail Fridman through his company AF Telecom.

      "bodyText": "London's largest initial public offering of the year has been launched, with Russian tycoon Alisher Usmanov's mobile operator MegaFon confirming it intends to float before Christmas. Usmanov \u2013 who is Russia's richest man, according to Forbes, and the second largest shareholder in Arsenal football club \u2013 is not selling any of his MegaFon holding in the float but has already enjoyed a multimillion-dollar payday this year. He was one of the early investors in Facebook and sold shares in its record $16bn IPO in May. Usmanov took control of MegaFon in April, buying out fellow tycoon Mikhail Fridman through his company AF Telecom. Sources close to the float estimate it could raise $2bn (\u00a31.25bn), making it the biggest in London since Glencore's $10bn debut in May last year. Russia's No 2 mobile network by revenues and subscribers is expected to sell 15-20% of its shares, resulting in a partial exit for its other remaining shareholder, Sweden's TeliaSonera. The first of the big three Russian networks to offer 4G mobile internet connections, MegaFon said on Tuesday it expected to float its ordinary shares on the Micex exchange in Moscow and global depositary receipts on the London stock exchange \"in the fourth quarter of 2012\". Pre-roadshow meetings with potential investors are understood to be starting this week, with Morgan Stanley and Sberbank CIB leading the banking advisory team, and Citi, Credit Suisse and VTB Capital joining them as bookrunners. The new capital would be used to repay or finance existing debt and continue the expansion of the network. \"This is the right time for our IPO, which will support a new stage in MegaFon's development,\" the company's chief executive, Ivan Tavrin, said. \"We are now positioned to exploit the further growth potential of Russia's mobile market as it transitions from voice to high-value data services.\" Having invested heavily in 3G services, and with its 4G signal now available in 40 Russian cities, MegaFon has been at the forefront of the smartphone revolution and now controls more data revenues, which are generated by customers using the internet on their handsets, than any other operator.

This comes after the Home Office reportedly plans to award the contract to support the replacement to the Criminal Records Bureau - which Capita has held for a decade - to another bidder.</p> <p>On acquisitions, investors were told Capita intends to spend between \u00a3200m and \u00a3250m a year on deals. So far this year, it has splashed out \u00a3170m.</p> <p>Analyst David Brockton at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> The event provided valuable insight into some of Capita's divisions and approach to growth, but it did not change our cautious stance on the business. </blockquote> <p>Caroline de La Soujeole at Seymour Pierce moved from buy to hold, saying:</p> <blockquote> We were not enthused by Capita's investor day yesterday which sought to provide an in-depth view of five of its divisions. The presentation did bring home the message that Capita has an increasingly diversified revenue base and acquisitions have been instrumental in helping Capita spread its wings. However, we were disappointed to hear that international expansion does not feature greatly in the company's plans.

      "bodyText": "Capita is leading the FTSE 100 fallers after the outsourcing group, which recently announced the loss of a long standing contract, failed to impress at an investor day on Monday. There was no new information on trading but the company said growth had improved throughout 2012 and it expected more contract wins. This comes after the Home Office reportedly plans to award the contract to support the replacement to the Criminal Records Bureau - which Capita has held for a decade - to another bidder. On acquisitions, investors were told Capita intends to spend between \u00a3200m and \u00a3250m a year on deals. So far this year, it has splashed out \u00a3170m. Analyst David Brockton at Espirito Santo said: The event provided valuable insight into some of Capita's divisions and approach to growth, but it did not change our cautious stance on the business. Caroline de La Soujeole at Seymour Pierce moved from buy to hold, saying: We were not enthused by Capita's investor day yesterday which sought to provide an in-depth view of five of its divisions. The presentation did bring home the message that Capita has an increasingly diversified revenue base and acquisitions have been instrumental in helping Capita spread its wings. However, we were disappointed to hear that international expansion does not feature greatly in the company's plans. Nonetheless, management was adamant that opportunities for both organic and acquisitive growth were plentiful in the UK. However, we have been here before.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has made clear that the government has no intention of easing up on its austerity programme, insisting that Britain does not need a 'Plan B' despite concerns expressed by the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has cut its growth forecasts for Britain and warned in its annual fiscal monitor on Tuesday that Britain will miss deficit reduction targets this year. Cameron said: \"These are difficult times for the economy and what the IMF report is doing is coming into line with other forecasters who have already said that growth is going to disappoint right across Europe this year. We know that,\" he told the BBC. \"The IMF also say we shouldn't abandon our plans in making reductions in government spending and also regrettably in some cases put up taxes to get on top of our debt and our deficit.\" He added: \"It's not 'Plan B' that we need. What we're doing is making sure that every part of 'Plan A' is firing on all cylinders.\" The government's target of reducing the cyclically adjusted annual deficit will be missed after the IMF estimated it will be reduced by 1.25% and 1.5% this year and next. Officials warned the UK that measures to boost growth will be needed if the economy fails to lift. They said the Treasury should put in place a Plan B to implement tax cuts and other measures to support businesses and consumers. The failure to restrict government spending puts the UK in the bottom third of developed nations, according to an IMF banding system that ranks countries into three groups. Britain, the US and France were held up by the Washington-based lender as among the worst performers, against Sweden and Denmark which appear in the top group. The IMF said it was difficult for the UK to reduce its annual deficit when tax receipts had declined in response to low growth, but it should continue to make strides to bring spending and income into balance. The cyclically adjusted annual deficit shows how well countries are balancing their budgets in normal times, without taking into account unusual costs or spending commitments. On Monday George Osborne said he would extend the government's cost-cutting programme until 2018, delaying the year that the UK achieves a balanced budget for three years based on estimates when it took office in 2010. Osborne expects the UK economy to recover over the next couple of years as consumers return to the high street and businesses begin to increase investment. He has also backed Bank of England initiatives to bring down borrowing costs to kickstart the housing market and encourage businesses to hire staff and expand production. But critics have called on the chancellor to take bold measures to support the economy and bolster confidence. Labour said the IMF report showed Osborne needed to adopt measures to boost growth without waiting to see if the situation deteriorated. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said: \"Twelve months ago, the IMF forecast growth of 1.6% in 2012 and said a plan B would be needed if growth were to be lower than expected.

He said markets may accept stimulus packages by the US and UK in the short term, but could panic at a later stage, causing a catastrophic economic event. He said countries should move gradually to balance their budgets to protect vulnerable members of society from the worst effects of austerity. Asked if his advice applied to Greece and Portugal, he said that it was only possible to take a gradual approach when the international markets were satisfied the commitment and implementation were in place, which was not the case in peripheral eurozone nations.",
