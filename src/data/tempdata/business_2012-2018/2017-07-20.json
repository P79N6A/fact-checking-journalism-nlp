      "bodyText": "There have been calls for a boycott of Boots after the chemist refused to lower the cost of the morning-after pill for fear it would encourage over-use. Rivals Tesco and Superdrug halved the price of the emergency contraceptive following a campaign from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), a leading provider of abortion care. The charity had written to retailers asking them to consider offering a more affordable product, after it was revealed that British women are forced to pay up to five times more than their European peers for the contraceptive. Boots, however, said it would not lower the price as it did not want to be accused of \u201cincentivising inappropriate use\u201d. Campaigners said its statement was insulting and sexist. Around 4% of British women of reproductive age use emergency contraception in any given year. Boots charges \u00a328.25 for Levonelle emergency contraceptive (the leading brand) and \u00a326.75 for its own generic version. Tesco now charges \u00a313.50 for Levonelle and Superdrug \u00a313.49 for a generic version. In France, the tablet costs \u00a35.50. A letter seen by the Guardian to BPAS from Marc Donovan, chief pharmacist of Boots UK, said it had considered the issue very carefully, but pointed out that it is already available for free in community pharmacies and NHS services. However, towards the end of the letter, Donovan wrote: \u201cIn our experience the subject of emergency hormonal contraception polarises public opinion and we receive frequent contact from individuals who voice their disapproval of the fact that the company chooses to provide this service. \u201cWe would not want to be accused of incentivising inappropriate use, and provoking complaints, by significantly reducing the price of this product.\u201d BPAS said deliberately setting the price high to prevent women from using it regularly was both \u201cpatronising and insulting\u201d. Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at BPAS, said: \u201cThere is no doubt about it: the high price of [emergency contraception] is an absolute barrier to women\u2019s access to this product and puts women needlessly at risk of unwanted pregnancy.\u201d Murphy wrote back to Donovan after Tesco and Superdrug reduced the price, asking him to reconsider Boots\u2019 position. \u201cHe wrote back and said they weren\u2019t changing their minds and the letter still stood,\u201d she said. Sophie Walker, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality Party, which has joined forces with BPAS to call for a boycott using the hashtag #justsaynon, said that the morning-after pill can be difficult to access for free on the NHS, with appointments at GP surgeries or family planning clinics hard to obtain at short notice. She said: \u201cMany women will need to buy these pills over the counter, and it is irresponsible and exploitative for retailers to charge over the odds for them ... Boots\u2019 approach to this concern is indicative of a society that prioritises profit over women\u2019s health and wellbeing.\u201d When asked for a comment, Boots released a statement that did not discuss the price, nor its reasons for justifying it being kept high, but instead said the sale of the pill was a \u201cprofessional healthcare service which, we believe, requires a professional healthcare consultation\u201d. When asked if the reason for the higher price was due to the provision of consultations, Boots did not respond with a comment.",

      "bodyText": "Skip over a few details in Sports Direct\u2019s full-year results statement and you can almost think the founder and chief executive, Mike Ashley, wants to turn the business into a conventional public company a decade after its arrival on the stock exchange. Look, he\u2019s finally hired a permanent finance director, one Jon Kempster, after three years of stand-ins. Following a year in which profits fell almost 60%, Ashley is also making an investor-pleasing forecast of improvements in the pipeline: top-line earnings are predicted to improve 5-15% this year. And, just like a regular boss, he\u2019s got a misleading corporate slogan \u2013 \u201cthe Selfridges of sport\u201d. The problem with the normalisation pitch, however, is that the details matter. The first problem is Sport Direct\u2019s habit of punting on other companies\u2019 shares. Why does it need a 17% stake in Debenhams, for example? The argument that the holding provides leverage to obtain square footage in the department stores is laughable. And the 26% stake in video games firm Game Digital is just baffling. There there\u2019s the impossible-to-ignore continuing presence of Keith Hellawell as chairman. Independent shareholders, angry after years of governance mishaps, voted against Hellawell last September. Ashley then rolled out his majority stake to save him in a binding vote in January, while saying he hoped Hellawell would renege on his pledge to stand down if outsiders deliver a second thumbs-down. Thus Hellawell is now obliged to plead for support and hope \u201cthe progress\u201d Sports Direct has made in the past 12 months \u201cwill be taken into account\u201d by shareholders when voting this year. A confident chairman of a conventional company wouldn\u2019t have to sound so desperate. It is also hard to understand why outsiders should now back him. Hellawell has had eight years in post and a firmer chairman would have persuaded Ashley that it was in his own interests to address the shocking working practices earlier. Has there been progress in the past year, though? The efforts to improve working conditions can only be judged over time. The \u00a3300m-a-year splurge on property baffles many outsiders. Attempting to conquer the US, while Sports Direct is struggling in continental Europe, looks dangerous. But, yes, making the new stores smarter, which is all that is really implied by the \u201cSelfridges\u201d strategy, sounds like a reasonable idea to move with the market, or least follow better-performing JD Sports. But, if Ashley truly wants to herald a new era, he should let Hellawell go and avoid another showdown in September. The corporate boast about the \u00a3420m in corporation tax that has been paid in 10 years as a public company is fair. But, even when one person owns 62% of the shares, the chairman should still command the respect of other shareholders. Sky\u2019s the limit? Are the Murdochs getting rattled by the delays to their takeover bid for Sky? Certainly some of the dispatches from 21st Century Fox, and from Sky itself, are deploying some odd arguments. For example, there\u2019s the whinge that all jurisdictions apart from the UK have already given a thumbs-up. But what did they expect? The deal could plainly have more impact in the UK than in Italy or Germany. Besides, the general election caused one delay to the regulatory process and elections are a risk even Murdochs must accept. There there\u2019s the plea that \u201cbusinesses require a level of certainty in order to plan and invest.\u201d Well, yes, but Sky\u2019s strategy department hasn\u2019t been asleep. Only last month, the company announced a major shake-up of its sports packages and pricing structure. Summoning their lawyers, the Murdochs argued that the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, had a duty to make up her mind on whether to refer the deal to the Competition and Market Authority (CMA) before the parliamentary summer break. Bradley agreed on Thursday that she should move quickly but wants more time to consider the \u201ctens of the thousands\u201d of submissions. What\u2019s wrong with that? Some submissions may be copycat petitions. Some \u2013 like the letter from Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, and Sir Vince Cable, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats \u2013 have infuriated a Murdoch camp that wants to see \u201cpolitical interference\u201d at every turn. But, when there\u2019s a whiff of judicial review in the air, it is surely reasonable for Bradley to insist on time to do her job thoroughly. The most likely eventual outcome remains the same: Bradley will ask the CMA to investigate and approval will probably be given early next year. But the Murdochs\u2019 twitchiness suggests they are more nervous than they were a few weeks ago.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW This is also interesting. ECB insiders have told Bloomberg that the much-anticipated decision on the future of its bond-purchase programme might not come until October. A cynic might suggest the ECB didn\u2019t enjoy seeing the euro rally against the pound and the US dollar (as that weakens inflation), and wanted to recalibrate the markets\u2019 views..... Now this is interesting..... the ECB have just tweeted a video clip from today\u2019s press conference. And it\u2019s the section where Mario Draghi spells out that the ECB needs to be \u201cpersistent and patient, as we\u2019re not there yet\u201d. So that\u2019s the dovish message which the eurozone\u2019s central bank wants to get across :) Over in Athens, government officials have welcomed Mario Draghi\u2019s proclamation that Greece has made \u201cserious [fiscal] progress\u201d. It comes as speculation grows that Greece is close to testing its fortunes in the bond markets. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The leftist-led government announced today that it was \u201cclosely monitoring developments in markets \u2026 [and] trends\u201d in preparation of a market return, possibly as early as next week. When it judged the \u201cmoment was appropriate\u201d it would make the first move, it said. Athens has hired six international banks to oversee the bond sale in what would be its first market foray in three years. The government spokesman Dimitiris Tzanakopoulos has told the Guardian that the country wants to test the ground with \u201ctest exits in order to be able at the end of the programme to finance our debt without official sector support.\u201d Greece\u2019s latest bailout programme, a third financial package of \u20ac86bn euro, expires in August 2018. And in another key development, the IMF has indicated that it is ready to finally approve Greece\u2019s bailout package. A spokesman said the ultimate goal is to get Greece to return to markets, adding that \u201cdebt sustainability discussion only just starting.\u201d Here\u2019s an alternative view... City research group Fathom has some late gloomy news; they reckon the chances of a UK recession over the next year is greater than 50%. They cite the slowdown in consumer spending in recent months, as inflation erodes wages. In a new report, they say: Defying widespread expectation of a recession, the UK economy weathered the Brexit storm better than the majority of forecasters, ourselves included, anticipated. That was thanks, in large part, to the strength of consumer spending. But that tide has since turned: the brief period of real wage growth is over; household finances are stretched; and June\u2019s inconclusive general election has reignited concerns about the nation\u2019s economic prospects. With the key driver of UK GDP growth, the consumer, under assault, we believe that there is now a greater-than-evens chance of a technical recession in the UK over the next year. The pound has hit an eight month low against the euro. That\u2019s bad news for British holidaymakers planning a trip to Europe this summer. Sky News has more details: Sterling slipped close to \u20ac1.11 as the euro strengthened in reaction to remarks by European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi while the UK currency was again buffeted by fears over Brexit. The pound\u2019s dip - of as much as two cents - took it to its lowest level since November 2016. It will weaken the spending power of British families preparing to flock to Spanish beaches and French campsites when school holidays begin later this week. Ouch! Consumer confidence in the eurozone has fallen unexpectedly. The European Commissions gauge of consumer morale has dropped to minus 1.7, from minus 1.3 in June. Economists had expected it to rise to minus 1.1. I suspect Mario Draghi arrived at today\u2019s press conference determined to say as little as possible. And he almost succeeded. Reporters seeking detailed answers on how the ECB might unwind its stimulus programme were met with a firm \u201cwe didn\u2019t discuss that\u201d. But one piece of news did slip out - Draghi\u2019s pledge that the ECB will discuss the next stage in its QE programme \u2018in the autumn\u2019. That promise came with a warning that policymakers must remain prudent, patient and persistent -- which is Draghi\u2019s way of saying that it\u2019s too early to tighten policy today. He insisted that inflation pressures are still weak, and warned that a premature tightening would threaten the whole eurozone recovery. Hardly the words of a full-blown hawk. But the prospect that the ECB might taper its \u20ac60bn/month bond-buying programme in September or October has tantalised investors, sending the euro close to a 16-month high. But that move could be premature, given Draghi insisted that inflation pressures remain subdued and that a substantial stimulus is still needed. What the experts say.... Kathleen Brooks of City Index says Draghi sounded dovish today: The key takeaway from today\u2019s meeting is that a September taper announcement looks increasingly unlikely as the ECB said that a \u201cvery substantial degree of accommodation is needed\u201d to boost inflation, and that the ECB\u2019s QE programme will run until the inflation rate picks up. Since core inflation remains at 1.1%, well below the ECB\u2019s 2% target rate, this suggests that QE has further to go. Indeed, the ECB stressed that it would increase its asset purchase scheme, which currently stands at \u20ac60bn a month, if the inflation picture deteriorated further. Marchel Alexandrovich, Chief European Economist at Jefferies, insists that nothing has really changed.... In reality, there are no big changes from the June press conference or the keynote speech from a few weeks ago. And the overall message is that while the economy is recovering, inflation will only return to target as long as the ECB maintains its accommodative policy stance. But Draghi is also making sure that the markets don\u2019t get ahead of themselves and start pricing in QE adjustment before the ECB settles on the right policy path. In fact, Draghi seems to allow for the possibility that the decision on how to extend QE will not be announced in September, and the exact details may follow later \u2013 26 October, or even 14 December. Megan Greene of Manulife Asset Management thinks Draghi played a good game: But Alex Lydall, Head of Dealing at Foenix Partners, says Draghi failed to keep the euro\u2019s value down. Draghi did his best this afternoon to cap the euro, failing quite spectacularly! During his press conference, the ECB President noted that officials were unanimous in not outlining a timeframe on tapering, stating the Central Bank \u2018was not there yet\u2019. Many would have seen this in a dovish light and possibly bearish for the single currency, but much the opposite appears to be taking place. And finally.... Q: are you worried that areas of the eurozone economy which have benefitted from your stimulus programme will struggle when it is taken away? That goes beyond our remit, Draghi replies. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference, a good 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. School is out for the summer! Q: Does September 7th count as the autumn? [ie, could a decision on tapering QE come at the ECB\u2019s next meeting?] Haha, says Draghi. That\u2019s exactly why we have kept our plans vague, and only agreed to discuss QE sometime in the autumn, he replies. Q: Does the ECB\u2019s inflation target need to be rethought, given the failure to hit it? Draghi points out that most top central banks aim for an inflation rate of around 2%. Six million jobs have been created since the stimulus programme was created - that shows how successful it\u2019s been. How credible would an institution be if it just changed an objective every time it struggled to reach it, he continues, before warning that it would be very destabilising to consider adjusting the inflation target now. Q: Might the ECB change its \u2018capital key\u2019 rules (which dictate how many bonds it can buy from each eurozone country)? We haven\u2019t discussed that, says Draghi (this is his theme for the day) Q: Will you have concrete options on the table for a possible QE exit in time for your next meeting, in September? Or would you only take the decision to task staff to do that work at September\u2019s meeting? And.... secondly, what are the chances that you have to change your QE programme again, to ensure there are enough bonds to buy? The answer to the second question is that we didn\u2019t discuss it, and for the first question too, says Draghi tetchily. The euro has jumped while Draghi is speaking. It\u2019s now up 0.5% today at $1.155, having been a cent lower earlier. This may be triggered by Draghi\u2019s comment that the ECB will discuss how to proceed with its QE programme in the autumn..... Q: Have you asked staff to look at the technical details of QE after December (when the current programme expires)? No, says Draghi. It\u2019s not been discussed, and they\u2019ve not been tasked. Q: Several ECB appointments have been overturned in the last year, and your own advisor is being challenged - so what can you do to improve hiring practices? We are grateful when mistakes are caught, says Draghi, before adding that it\u2019s \u2018sad\u2019 when these issues are discussed in the media. Q: Greece wants to return to the financial markets, so how confident are you that the ECB will include Greece in your QE programme, and buy its government bonds? It\u2019s up to the Greek government to decide whether to tap the markets, says Draghi. He points out that Bank of Greece has expressed some concern about the plan, but also acknowledges that there has been \u201cserious progress\u201d in Greece. The governing council trusts the strength and the power of its monetary package in all its elements, says Draghi firmly. We still stay in the market for a long time, he adds. Is he channelling Darth Vader?! Q: You sound more dovish on inflation than in your speech in Sintra last month, so how do you see inflation rising to the ECB\u2019s target? Draghi insists that there\u2019s little difference between today\u2019s statement, and the Sintra speech (when he said that inflationary pressures had replaced deflationary ones). It is going to take \u201csome time\u201d for the factors holding down inflation to weaken, but it will happen, he pledges. Q: Is the ECB worried about triggering a taper tantrum, like the US Federal Reserve experienced, when it slows its bond-buying programme? Inflation is not where we want it to be, nor where it should be, Mario Draghi replies firmly. That\u2019s why a substantial degree of accommodative monetary policy is still needed. He strikes an upbeat tone, saying that the eurozone is now enjoying a \u201crobust\u201d recovery. We only have to wait for wages and prices to follow course. The last thing the Governing Council wants is an untimely tightening that slows down this process, or even jeopardises it. Onto questions. Q) Did the ECB discuss what changes it would make to its asset purchase scheme after December? We reviewed the economic and financial developments in the euro area, says Draghi. That included the improved economic recovery and the lack of any \u201cconvincing sign\u201d of a pick-up in core inflation. The broad message is that we must be \u201cPersistent and patient, and prudent, as we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d, says Draghi, reiterating points he made last month at the ECB\u2019s forum in Sintra. Draghi also revealed that the governing council was \u201cunanimous in setting no precise date on when to discuss changes in the future.\u201d In other words, our discussions should take place in the fall, or in the autumn as we are in Europe. Q) Are you concerned that the euro has strengthened since your speech in Sintra last month, and are those gains excessive? The repricing of the exchange rate has received \u201csome attention\u201d, Draghi replies smoothly. As usual, Draghi ends his statement by urging eurozone politicians to implement structural reforms. The risks to the growth outlook in the eurozone are broadly balanced, Draghi continues. But this growth has not yet translated into \u2018stronger inflation dynamics\u2019, he says -- pointing out that headline inflation is dampened by weak energy prices. So, a \u2018substantial degree of accommodation\u2019 is still needed, he declared -- a sign that the ECB isn\u2019t ready to turn off the stimulus taps yet. On the big picture, Draghi says that the global recovery should support trade, and boost eurozone exports. But underlying inflation will probably only rise gradually, meaning that headline inflation will probably remain at current levels in the coming months (it was just 1.3% in June.) Mario Draghi has arrived in the ECB\u2019s press room, accompanied by vice-president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio. He begins by confirming that the governing council decided to keep the key interest rates unchanged, and expects them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time - and and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. He also confirms that the ECB expects to keep buying \u20ac60bn of new assets each month until December, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aims. Draghi adds that the QE programme could be increased, in terms of size and/or duration, if needed. (he\u2019s basically reading out the statement released earlier) A quick newsflash from America - the number of people signing on for jobless benefits has fallen to a nine-week low of 233,000. That\u2019s down from 247,000 last week, and shows the US labor market is still robust. The euro has also dropped 0.3% against the pound, to \u20ac1.127, meaning one euro is worth 88.7p. Alexandra Russell-Oliver of currency trading firm Caxton says the euro could fall further once Mario Draghi speaks. But in the longer term, it is likely to gain value. She says: The press conference will be key as traders seek clues as to the timing of the winding down of stimulus. ECB President could strike a more cautious tone to avoid adding further fuel to the speculative fire, which may weaken the euro. Ultimately, the expected winding down of stimulus will likely continue to be supportive of the euro.\u201d Mario Draghi will explain today\u2019s decisions to the press pack in Frankfurt shortly. You can watch the press conference live, here: (I\u2019ve also embedded this at the top of the blog) Kathleen Brooks of City Index says anticipation is building on the trading floors.... The key takeaway from the press conference for us will be how Draghi justifies his \u201chawkish\u201d talk in Sintra late last month when he mentioned the word \u201creflation\u201d and euro bulls ran with it. Considering there are still no signs of reflation and the ECB\u2019s statement is still as dovish and QE-supporting as ever, will Draghi backtrack? Kerim Derhalli, CEO and founder of investment game app invstr, says Mario Draghi is keen not to roil the markets today: \u201cWhile the possibility of an unlikely interest rate hike is slowly growing, it\u2019s no surprise that Mario Draghi has opted to keep European Central Bank rates unchanged for now. \u201cDespite some evidence that monetary stimulus has been working, the fact that inflation in the eurozone slipped back to 1.3% in June suggests that a change now would be unwise. \u201cDraghi will have also been mindful of the market overreaction to his speech in Sintra, which saw a surge in bond yields and the euro.\u201d Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet says today\u2019s statement is dovish, simply because the ECB hasn\u2019t changed its position on QE. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski agrees: Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever points out that this month\u2019s statement is virtually identical to June\u2019s one (except this month\u2019s meeting took place in Frankfurt, not Tallinn). Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the ECB will change policy in September The euro has dipped following the ECB announcement, down 0.3% at $1.148. That\u2019s because the governing council didn\u2019t drop its pledge to boost its stimulus programme in the future, if needed. Importantly, the European Central Bank has not decided to \u2018taper\u2019 its stimulus scheme today. Instead, the central bank has repeated its pledge to keep buying \u20ac60bn of new bonds each month until the end of this year. It is also sticking to its promise to extend the programme if needed - a dovish signal. The ECB says: Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of \u20ac60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The ECB has repeated its pledge to keep borrowing costs at their record low \u201cfor an extended period of time\u201d, and well past the horizon when it stops buying new assets through its QE programme. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged, at today\u2019s meeting. That means that: The headline interest rates remains at its current record low of 0.0%. Eurozone banks will still be charged 0.4% to leave money at the ECB, rather than lending it. Eurozone banks will also be charged 0.25% to borrow from the ECB. More to follow.... We may have a winner... There are just 30 minutes to go until the European Central Bank announces this month\u2019s monetary policy decision (followed by Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference 45 minutes later) Naeem Aslam of Think Markets predicts a cautious performance from the ECB president: The panic could only be if the ECB drops some unexpected surprise in the market and the chances of that are very low. We expect the ECB to be very subtle in their approach and the main agenda for them would be to reinforce their forward guidance. What we do want to hear from the ECB is that the policy members have discussed the topic of tapering. In the meantime, Alberto Gallo of Algebris Investment is playing the traditional game trying to guess Mario Draghi\u2019s tie colour (possibly a guide to the president\u2019s mood...) More alarming figures from Greece have been released this morning, showing that the net worth of Greek households fell by a staggering 40% between 2009, when the country\u2019s debt drama erupted, and 2014. Helena Smith reports from Athens The figures released by the Bank of Greece are further proof of just how much the disposable income of Greek households has shrunk since the start of the country\u2019s financial crisis. Bank researchers, releasing the findings, said the net worth of average households contracted from \u20ac108,649 in 2009 to \u20ac65,030 in 2014. There drop in poorer households was even more dramatic with some suffering a loss of 70.8% in net wealth over the same period. The leftist-led government has announced it will be taking measures to alleviate the hardships of those worse hit by the rigours of austerity - the price of three emergency bailout programmes for the debt stricken country since May 2010. With the Brexit clock ticking, Deutsche Bank has told its staff that it is preparing for a \u2018hard\u2019 exit from the EU. That will means that some operations are shifted out of London and transferred to Frankfurt. Bloomberg has the details: Deutsche Bank is preparing for a hard Brexit and will probably book the \u201cvast majority\u201d of its assets in Frankfurt, Chief Executive Officer John Cryan tells employees in a videotaped message. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of detail to be ironed out and agreed; depending on what the rules and regulations turn out to be, we will try to minimize disruption for our clients and for our own people,\u201d Cryan says in the video. \u201cBut inevitably roles will need to be either moved or at least added in Frankfurt.\u201d The pound jumped back over $1.30 when the retail sales figures hit the wires, but the rally didn\u2019t have legs. Sterling is now back at $1.2960, down over half a cent today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains why: Although the bounce in sales last month was a welcome development, it still means that for the first half of the year retail sales will be relatively flat, and may only contribute 0.1% to Q2 GDP. This does not bode well for the UK growth outlook, which is one reason why the pound\u2019s reaction has been muted. Thus, unless we see retail sales rise consistently in the coming months, which could be a big ask as we get deeper into Brexit negotiations that may trigger consumer uncertainty, then second half growth could be hindered, limiting the pound\u2019s chance of a meaningful rally. It\u2019s also worth remembering that Britain\u2019s retail sales figures are partly based on credit. The latest figures from the Bank of England showed that unsecured consumer credit , such as credit cards, jumped by 10.3% in the year to May, five times as fast as the growth rate of earnings. Dr Rebecca Harding, the CEO of Equant Analytics, thinks this is an important factor: Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, fears that UK consumer spending will remain subdued for many months: \u201cThe volume of retail sales has been quite volatile from month to month over the first half of this year. There was a recovery in June from a disappointing May, perhaps supported by warmer weather. But, over the past three months, the level of retail spending adjusted for inflation is no higher than it was in the final quarter of last year. \u201cConsumer spending has stalled, after a period of strong growth - with retail sales volumes increasing by 4.4% a year in the three years 2014-16. Rising inflation, driven by a weak pound, has squeezed the purchasing power of consumers. We should expect this subdued pattern of retail sales and consumer growth to continue in the second half of this year and into early 2018. Despite June\u2019s revival, UK retail sales have actually been flattish since the start of 2017. Kate Davies, Office for National Statistics Senior Statistician, explains: \u201cToday\u2019s retail sales figures show overall growth. A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales for the month. \u201cLooking at the quarterly data, the underlying trend as suggested by the three-month on three-month movement is one of growth, following a fall in quarter 1, suggesting a relatively flat first half of 2017.\u201d Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted some useful charts too: Ana Boata, European Economist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, fears that retailers face a challenging time: \u201cHigh levels of competition, increasing market share moving to discounters and an online shopping frequency more than twice the European average have already made the UK retail one of the most challenging in the world. This is before the loss in households\u2019 purchasing power and the rise in import costs are added to the mix. \u201cNet gearing ratios in the sector increased by more than 10pp to 66 per cent last year, while average profits (EBIT) slipped by 1.4pp to 5.6 per cent. In addition, the rise in import costs adds pressures on the already deteriorating profitability. Such signals of deterioration in financial health suggest greater pressure on cash flow and payment terms throughout the retail supply chain. \u201cPressure on consumers is impacting the sector as retail sales have slowed over the last several months. UK household savings are now at the lowest level in 50 years and are equivalent to a level registered in the US in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. This, plus falling regular earnings when adjusted for inflation, allude to an extremely challenging environment for retailers.\u201d Breaking! UK retail sales grew faster than expected in June, as warmer weather sent Brits racing to the shops. That\u2019s according to the Office for National Statistics, which has just reported that the amount of stuff bought in the shops last month rose by 0.6%. The City had expected a 0.4% gain, following a 1.2% decline in May. It suggest that consumer spending is holding up, even though rising inflation is eating into household incomes. Her are the key points from the ONS: In the 3 months to June 2017, the quantity bought (volume) in the retail industry is estimated to have increased by 1.5%, with increases seen across all store types. The growth for Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2017 follows a decline of 1.4% in Quarter 1 (Jan Mar) 2017, meaning we are broadly at the same level as at the start of 2017. Compared with May 2017, the quantity bought increased by 0.6%, with non-food stores providing the main contribution. Feedback from retailers suggests that warmer weather in addition to the introduction of summer clothing helped boost clothing sales. Average store prices (including petrol stations) increased by 2.7% on the year following a rise of 3.2% in May 2017; the fall is a consequence of slowing fuel prices. Online sales (excluding automotive fuel) increased year-on-year by 15.9% and by 1.8% on the month, accounting for approximately 16.2% of all retail spending. The pound has lost ground in early trading, dropping 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.2985. That\u2019s helping to push shares higher in London, where the FTSE 100 is up 31 points. Here\u2019s a handy chart showing the Bank of Japan\u2019s struggle to get inflation up to its 2% targetL Still, perhaps a bit more stimulus will work.... In the City, shares in Sports Direct have jumped by 7% this morning, despite reporting a 60% slump in profits in the last year. Sports Direct suffered after failing to hedge itself sufficiently against the slump in the pound. But founder Mike \u201cpower drinker\u201d Ashley insists that the business is improving. He told investors that: \u201cSports Direct is on course to become the \u201cSelfridges\u201d of sport by migrating to a new generation of stores to showcase the very best products from our third party brand partners. We have invested over \u00a3300m in property over the last year, and I am pleased to report that early indications show that trading in our new flagship stores is exceeding expectations.\u201d The City should also be reassured to see that Sports Direct has appointed a new full time chief finance officer, filling a four-year (!) vacancy. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale predicts that today\u2019s European Central Bank press conference will be dominated by questions about how, and when, it will exit its stimulus programme. While acknowledging the strength of the economy, Draghi is likely to counter any ideas of an imminent and rapid path towards ending QE, instead urging patience with the still-subdued inflation outlook. We maintain our call for an announcement in September of a six-month extension of the APP into 2018 at \u20ac40bn/month, followed by data-dependent quarterly reductions. FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed says Mario Draghi will be desperate to avoid driving the euro higher today. The last thing the ECB wants is a strong Euro and tightened financial conditions for now. It is a complicated process to start normalizing policy without disrupting markets, so while Draghi wants to prepare investors for a gradual wind-down of asset purchases, he is likely to hint that the pace will be gradual and easing options will remain open. The trickiest part is how to deliver a confident message without leading to further selloffs in bonds and stocks and additional appreciation in the Euro. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services suspects the ECB will resist pressure to trim its stimulus programme today, but may get the ball rolling.... What may be announced at the meeting is that various ECB departments and committees will be given the task of exploring the best methodology, with a decision deferred until September, when it will also have an updated set of staff forecasts. Marc also expects president Draghi will return to the themes covered in that speech in Sintra last month, when he said the eurozone recovery was \u201cstrengthening and broadening\u201d Given the market furore around Draghi\u2019s comments about \u201creflationary forces displacing deflationary forces\u201d, he will surely want to clarify precisely what he meant, and most likely qualify those comments by suggesting that core CPI is far from displaying a sustainable uptrend that would see headline CPI heading towards the ECB target of close to 2.0%, even if the disinflationary threat has passed. And Mike Bird of the WSJ reports that anticipation is building up nicely... Please insert your own joke about surprise liquidity injections.... Haruhiko Kuroda has just denied that the Bank of Japan\u2019s has lost credibility by pushing its inflation target back again today. The BoJ governor is giving a press conference now, and pointed out that other central banks have also pushed back their own inflation targets. Kuroda reiterated that the risks to inflation and economic growth are to the downside, and put some blame on companies for being too cautious to raise prices. And crucially, he won\u2019t rule out increasing the BoJ\u2019s stimulus programme, if needed. Overnight, the Bank of Japan has decided to maintain its huge stimulus programme - and admitted that it is struggling to get inflation up. Following its policy meeting, Japan\u2019s central bank on Thursday cut its inflation forecasts for the next few years. It now admits it won\u2019t hit its 2% target until 2020, despite having thrown trillions of new yen into the money supply in recent years. This is a blow to governor Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s radical attempts to stimulate inflation by buying a staggering 80 trillion yen of bonds each year (that\u2019s around \u00a3550bn) But the BoJ is pressing on with the stimulus programme, keeping overnight interest rates at minus 0.1%, and capping 10-year bond yields at about zero per cent. In a statement, the BoJ admitted that it is struggling to drive earnings higher, saying: \u201cRecent price developments have been relatively weak, as companies remained cautious in raising wages and prices. \u201cRisks to the economy and price outlook are skewed to the downside.\u201d This is the SIXTH time that the BoJ has pushed back its inflation target, since Kuroda launched his huge asset-buying program in 2013. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. To taper, or not to taper? That\u2019s the question on the lips of European Central Bank policymakers today as they hold their final monetary policy meeting before the summer holidays. With Europe\u2019s economy strengthening, hawks on the ECB\u2019s governing council will be pushing their colleagues to consider trimming (or \u2018tapering\u2019) their stimulus programme. That programme is currently mopping up \u20ac60bn of bonds each month with newly minted money, and investors around the globe are desperate to know how, and when, the ECB might wind it down. BUT.... the ECB needs to tread cautiously, for fear of a \u2018taper tantrum\u2019. Bond prices gyrated alarmingly last month when president Mario Draghi gave a confident speech which seemed to hint that policy would be tightened soon. Most economists expect the governing council to postpone any decision on tapering until their September meeting. But you never know.... Assuming the ECB don\u2019t make any policy changes today, the big moment will be Draghi\u2019s press conference at 1.30pm BST. Expect the euro to be volatile. Any hint of imminent tapering would send the currency soaring, while a dovish performance from Draghi could sink it. It\u2019s currently trading at $1.152, close to an eight-month high. Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s economy, when new retail sales figures for June are released. The City expects a small rise in spending, after sales fell unexpectedly in May. Consumer good giant Unilever, UK retailers Sports Direct and Mothercare, banknote maker De La Rue, and energy provider SSE are all reporting results today. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK retail sales for June 10am BST: Eurozone deficit figures for Q1 2017 12.45pm BST: ECB interest rate decision announced 1.30pm: ECB holds press conference 1.30pm: US weekly jobless figures 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence figures for July",

Indeed, the ECB stressed that it would increase its asset purchase scheme, which currently stands at \u20ac60bn a month, if the inflation picture deteriorated further.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Marchel Alexandrovich</strong>, Chief European Economist at <strong>Jefferies</strong>, insists that nothing has really changed....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In reality, there are no big changes from the June press conference or the keynote speech from a few weeks ago. And the overall message is that while the economy is recovering, inflation will only return to target as long as the ECB maintains its accommodative policy stance. </p> <p>But Draghi is also making sure that the markets don\u2019t get ahead of themselves and start pricing in QE adjustment before the ECB settles on the right policy path. In fact, Draghi seems to allow for the possibility that the decision on how to extend QE will not be announced in September, and the exact details may follow later \u2013 26 October, or even 14 December.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Megan Greene</strong> of <strong>Manulife Asset Management</strong> thinks Draghi played a good game:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/economistmeg/status/888031359092092928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Draghi bought himself tons of wiggle room in both directions (dovish and hawkish).

This is before the loss in households\u2019 purchasing power and the rise in import costs are added to the mix.</p> <p>\u201cNet gearing ratios in the sector increased by more than 10pp to 66 per cent last year, while average profits (EBIT) slipped by 1.4pp to 5.6 per cent. In addition, the rise in import costs adds pressures on the already deteriorating profitability. Such signals of deterioration in financial health suggest greater pressure on cash flow and payment terms throughout the retail supply chain.</p> <p>\u201cPressure on consumers is impacting the sector as retail sales have slowed over the last several months. UK household savings are now at the lowest level in 50 years and are equivalent to a level registered in the US in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. This, plus falling regular earnings when adjusted for inflation, allude to an extremely challenging environment for retailers.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59706a75e4b01ec8540486b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-20T08:36:19.600Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK retail sales beat forecasts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking!

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley insists that Sports Direct is on track to become the \u201cSelfridges of sport\u201d despite reporting a near 60% dive in annual profits. Underlying profits before tax at the sportswear chain slumped by 58.7% from \u00a3275.2m to \u00a3113.7m in the year to the end of April. Ashley, the company\u2019s billionaire founder, chief executive and majority shareholder, blamed the fall in profits on the decline in the value of the pound against the dollar, which he said had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d. But shares in the retailer closed up nearly 11.5% at 335p as it announced the appointment of a finance director for the first time since 2013 and forecast that earnings for the year ahead would rise by between 5% and 15%. Many City analysts were expecting another decline. Sports Direct had to issue a profit warning last October after a bet designed to protect itself against a slump in sterling went wrong, causing it to lose \u00a315m in the currency markets during an overnight \u201cflash crash\u201d in the value of sterling in the east Asia. Ashley told City analysts that he was now expecting a better UK performance at Sports Directs partly because the company had \u201csmashed the ball out of the park\u201d with its investment in more up-market flagship stores. The latest development is a new strategic partnership with Japanese footwear brand Asics, which will take space in Sports Direct\u2019s flagship stores. The company is also beginning to take action after being hit by a scandal over its treatment of workers after a Guardian investigation. MPs described conditions at the group\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse as like a \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Retail sales rebounded in June as the sunny weather put consumers in the mood to update their summer wardrobes. Sales rose by 0.6% last month, beating the 0.4% increase forecast by economists and following a sharp 1.1% drop in May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). While consumers splashed out on T-shirts and sandals, as well as household goods, the volume of food and fuel sales fell. \u201cA particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales for the month,\u201d said Kate Davies, a senior statistician at the ONS. A better-than-expected June pushed up retail sales by 1.5% in the second quarter overall, following a 1.4% fall in the first quarter. Ian Geddes, head of retail at the consultancy Deloitte, said the sunny weather had brought a \u201cGlastonbury feelgood factor\u201d to Britain\u2019s high streets. \u201cThe good weather has clearly boosted footfall on the high streets as well as clothing sales, which coincided with stores being full of summer lines,\u201d Geddes said. \u201cJune\u2019s retail numbers gave a timely boost to the second quarter, which means that the retail industry has ended the first half of the year flat, as opposed to down.\u201d Economists cautioned that the rebound could prove temporary amid a sustained fall in real pay as prices rise faster than wages. The first estimate of UK growth in the second quarter, published by the ONS next week, is expected to show a slight pick-up from 0.2% growth in the first quarter. \u201cConsumer spending has been a powerful engine of UK economic growth for the past three years, but has now lost momentum,\u201d said Andrew Sentance, a senior economic adviser at accountancy firm PwC and a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee. \u201cThe GDP figures for the second quarter are likely to confirm this picture of subdued economic growth. The vote for Brexit has created a more uncertain climate for business and a squeeze on consumers from higher inflation. We face the prospect of weak economic growth this year and next.\u201d Inflation actually fell unexpectedly in June and for the first time in nine months to 2.6% from 2.9% in May, mainly because of lower fuel prices. Reflecting the fall in inflation, the ONS said retail sales annual growth in shop prices \u2013 including petrol stations \u2013 slowed to 2.7% in June from 3.2% in May. However, with regular pay growth excluding bonuses currently running at 1.8%, workers are suffering a sustained period of falling real pay. Despite the weak backdrop for household finances, economists at Capital Economics said there were a number of reasons why a collapse in consumer spending was unlikely. \u201cThe squeeze in real wages looks likely to intensify as inflation continues to rise to around 3%. However, nominal spending should continue to hold up well, supported by strong employment growth, resilient consumer confidence and low borrowing costs. \u201cIn any case higher inflation should prove transitory, falling back to 2% by the end of 2018. Indeed, there are already signs that the effect of the weaker pound on retailers\u2019 costs is starting to wane. As such, while we are forecasting a slowdown in real consumer spending growth, a collapse looks unlikely.\u201d Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said a rise in retail sales in June was unlikely to convince Bank policymakers that the time was right to raise interest rates. \u201cWhile today\u2019s reading is welcome news and may limit any further downside to GDP growth during the second quarter, I doubt that the middle ground on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is going to get more hawkish on the back of sales of paddling pools and flip-flops,\u201d he said. Clarke predicted the MPC would leave UK interest rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.25% at its next policy meeting in August, despite inflation being well above the Bank\u2019s 2% target and forecast to climb higher.",

      "bodyText": "There are signs Britain\u2019s home baking boom may be running out of steam, just as Channel 4 prepares to relaunch one of its main catalysts, The Great British Bake Off. The amount of baking ingredients, including flour, dried fruits and cake coverings, sold by supermarkets fell 3.8% in the year to the end of March, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel. Every series of the Bake Off so far has spurred a peak in baking activity, with supermarkets racing to ensure they have supplies of key ingredients used in the show when it aired on the BBC. But these peaks have gradually diminished over the past four years. Activity in between the shows reached a new low last summer. Bakery kits, dried fruit and bread mixes have been hit the hardest, according to research from IRI, the grocery market analysis firm. It recorded declines at all the major brands, including Jus-Rol, Silver Spoon, Homepride, Allinson and McDougalls. Only Dr Oetker, the German maker of icing, sprinkles, flavourings and other baking ingredients, increased sales volumes. Thomas Steel, an analyst at Kantar, told the Grocer trade journal that consumers are purchasing both less per trip and not as often: \u201cHome baking across all retailers has seen brands being ousted by own-label ranges.\u201d Channel 4 is expected to relaunch the Bake Off show, which it controversially poached from the BBC, in September with only Paul Hollywood staying on from the original presenting and judging team. The new line up includes Prue Leith, Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding. But it is not clear whether the new look Bake Off will be able to maintain the popularity of the BBC version which secured 14.8m viewers for the series finale, half the viewing public, making it the most watched final ever. Series three winner John Whaite told the Grocer that Britain\u2019s home baking boom since the show first aired in 2010 was largely down to the influence of one key presenter who will not be part of the Channel 4 version - Mary Berry. \u201cMary\u2019s really soft approach and the way she gives honest but gentle criticism really emboldens people and encourages them to give it a go,\u201d he said. Even before Channel 4 bought the format, sales of baking ingredients had begun to fall back from a peak in 2014, according to IRI. Maureen Hinton, group research director at retail consultancy GlobalData, said that the trend was likely to continue unless Channel 4 was able to come up with \u201csomething very different that inspires people\u2019s interest\u201d. As budgets are squeezed by rising inflation, which is reducing families\u2019 spending power, Hinton said cooking main meals from scratch might rise but baking was a \u201cniche activity\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a leisure activity. You can buy cakes more cheaply and its not just buying flour and eggs, you have to turn your oven on and pay for that as well,\u201d she said. Baking ingredients brands are hoping the switch to Channel 4 might provide them with new opportunities to bolster sales, however, as they will be able to advertise alongside the programme for the first time. Channel 4 is in talks with advertisers to secure at least \u00a325m a year from a range of commercial deals to cover the cost of taking the biggest show on British TV from the BBC.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An aggressive tax avoidance scheme, linked to one of the recruitment industry\u2019s highest-profile names, is liquidating hundreds more companies, according to filings made after a Guardian investigation exposed how the exchequer could lose millions. It was revealed last week that the scheme \u2013 which has been promoted by Anderson Group and which experts say raises questions over triggering a possible criminal investigation \u2013 was found to be simultaneously winding up almost 2,000 tiny companies that formed part of the tax avoidance arrangements. The moves are said to make it extremely difficult to pursue the defunct firms for any potential VAT or national insurance debt \u2013 particularly as each mini-company appears to only have a Philippines-based director and barely any retained assets. In the latest development, hundreds more similar mini-companies linked to the scheme are being disbanded, according to insolvency filings published by the official public record, The Gazette. Scores of the latest companies to be put into voluntary liquidation had Filipino directors plus ties to Anderson Group, when checked against public records and internal Anderson documents seen by the Guardian. The arrangements were designed to save tax by setting up thousands of tiny firms to exploit VAT and national insurance rules that were originally intended to help very small businesses. To do that, promoters transferred contracts of low-paid workers from a single large employment agency into a web of tiny companies. So, if an employment agency previously supplied a warehouse with 300 workers, the scheme\u2019s promoters might create 150 new companies, each employing two workers. The voluntary liquidations of the companies linked to Anderson followed initial questions posed by HMRC\u2019s fraud and investigation service last year, which asked Anderson for details about the large numbers of VAT registration applications made on behalf of its clients. The Guardian\u2019s investigation triggered a series of parliamentary questions by Frank Field MP, the chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions select committee, who last week asked the chancellor: \u201cWhat assessment has [the chancellor] made of HMRC\u2019s ability to investigate and recover tax revenue lost to aggressive tax avoidance schemes promoted by the Anderson Group and others?\u201d Responding this week, Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general, said: \u201cHM Revenue and Customs does not comment on individual taxpayer cases. Where companies go into liquidation leaving unpaid debt to the exchequer, HMRC will seek to maximise returns through use of its powers of recovery in appropriate cases, and by working closely with the liquidator.\u201d Anderson did not respond to an invitation to comment on the latest liquidations. In a statement previously issued in response to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment, the group commercial director, Steven Zahab, said: \u201cAnderson Group is a global provider of support services across a range of markets and sectors. In all cases our services are provided in accordance with the law as it stands and, where appropriate, under advisement from counsel. \u201cIf the law changes, then our services do so as appropriate. We constantly seek QC or other professional opinion to ensure that we act within the rules at all times.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bid to take over Sky has been dealt a blow after the culture secretary said she needed more time to deliberate before calling in the competition regulator after being inundated with tens of thousands of submissions opposing the \u00a311.7bn deal. Karen Bradley said she had hoped to be able to make a final decision on whether to ask the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate the deal before parliament breaks up for summer on Friday. However, Bradley said she had received \u201ctens of thousands of representations\u201d, many of which duplicated each other, which needed to be looked at. \u201cA final decision can only be made after fully considering all relevant evidence on both the plurality and commitment to broadcasting grounds,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven the consultation only closed on Friday, there has not been time to consider all the representations.\u201d James and Lachlan Murdoch, as well as Fox\u2019s lawyers, Allen &amp; Overy, have written last-minute letters arguing that Bradley has a duty to expedite referring the deal to the CMA before the parliamentary summer break, which runs until 5 September. Bradley said she was still minded to refer the bid to the CMA to investigate on media plurality grounds, but added that she would consider asking it to look at whether the Murdochs will adhere to broadcasting standards in the UK. The media regulator, Ofcom, on which Bradley has based her decisions to date, said it found no grounds to ask the CMA to look at issues including the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News and issues relating to phone hacking. Opponents including Ed Miliband and Vince Cable, longstanding critics of the Murdochs, have argued that not making the issue of broadcasting standards part of the CMA review could leave Bradley\u2019s decision open to a judicial review. Bradley said she expected to deliver her final decision on the grounds on which to refer the deal in \u201cthe coming weeks\u201d, a timeline that will provide Fox with some succour. Given that the CMA can take from 24 to 36 weeks to reach a conclusion, Fox was keen not to have to wait until parliament returns on 5 September to officially hear that the deal was to be referred and for the investigation clock to start. In an effort to speed up the process, Fox decided not to submit an improved offer to spin off Sky News, knowing it would have significantly held up the consultation stage of the process, which is headed for referral in any case. \u201cI expect to be in a position to come to a final decision on referral, including in respect to the broadcasting standards grounds, in the coming weeks, and potentially during summer recess,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThat may mean I have to make a decision before parliament returns.\u201d The deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, chastised Bradley, saying she did not need to operate on Fox\u2019s corporate timeline and there was no need to come back with a decision while parliament was in recess. \u201cParliament must have the opportunity to scrutinise any decision she makes,\u201d he said. Bradley reminded him that she was in a quasi-judicial role and under the 2002 Enterprise Act there was a \u201clegitimate need for a prompt decision without undue delay\u201d. She added that for broadcasting standards to be made part of the CMA investigation, she would need to see significant new evidence. \u201cNothing I have seen so far has changed my mind, but I am going to look at all representations I have received,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cI will look at them all to see what evidence they provide. Ofcom\u2019s report on broadcasting standards was clear, unequivocal, there were no grounds on which I can refer. I am therefore looking [to see if there is any] new evidence, new substantive evidence.\u201d Fox said it has had a strong broadcasting record in the UK and urged Bradley to move forward with the referral process. \u201cFor over 25 years, 21st Century Fox and Sky have been proud broadcasters of good standing in the UK, a responsibility we take very seriously,\u201d a Fox spokeswoman said. \u201cWe respect the importance of regulatory scrutiny, and we continue in our commitment to work constructively with authorities, as we have done since this process began. In light of the transaction\u2019s benefits to the UK creative economy, we would urge the secretary of state to complete the regulatory process expeditiously.\u201d Sky shareholders can look forward to a \u00a3172m special dividend, which the satellite company said it would pay out if the deal did not complete this year. The delay in completion means Sky investors will now also receive a further interim dividend of up to \u00a3224m, usually paid out at the end of March. Fox has promised a \u00a3200m break fee if the deal fails to get done.",

Ofcom\u2019s report on broadcasting standards was clear, unequivocal, there were no grounds on which I can refer. I am therefore looking [to see if there is any] new evidence, new substantive evidence.\u201d</p> <p>Fox said it has had a strong broadcasting record in the UK and urged Bradley to move forward with the referral process.</p> <p>\u201cFor over 25 years, 21st Century Fox and Sky have been proud broadcasters of good standing in the UK, a responsibility we take very seriously,\u201d a Fox spokeswoman said. \u201cWe respect the importance of regulatory scrutiny, and we continue in our commitment to work constructively with authorities, as we have done since this process began. In light of the transaction\u2019s benefits to the UK creative economy, we would urge the secretary of state to complete the regulatory process expeditiously.\u201d</p> <p>Sky shareholders can look forward to a \u00a3172m special dividend, which the satellite company said it would pay out if the deal did not complete this year. </p> <p>The delay in completion means Sky investors will now also receive a further interim dividend of up to \u00a3224m, usually paid out at the end of March.

      "bodyText": "The trend among shoppers to switch to cheaper non-branded products as household budgets come under mounting pressure has been underlined by a 9% leap in sales of own-label groceries produced by food group Premier Foods over the last three months. At the same time sales of Premier\u2019s branded products \u2013 which include Mr Kipling cakes, Ambrosia rice puddings and Bisto gravy \u2013 slumped by nearly 8%. Overall sales of branded and own-label foods were down by 3.1% . In the desserts business, sales of branded products climbed 1.4% \u2013 but sales of non-branded products (puddings produced for supermarkets\u2019 own-label ranges) surged by nearly 18%. Brits are increasingly opting for supermarkets\u2019 own-label products as they try to manage the impact of rising inflation and falling real wages on family finances. Recent research by Kantar Worldpanel showed that supermarkets\u2019 own-label sales rose 6% year on year, while branded products edged up only 0.6%. As households feel the squeeze, shoppers are seekingbetter value for money by heading to discount chains and buying budget basics. Premier said retailers are also cutting back on promotions, and it blamed the warm June weather for slowing sales of cooking sauces, flavourings and seasonings. The company has also been hit by rising costs linked to the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote. Premier stuck to its forecasts for the full year, saying it would return to sales growth in the second quarter and post flat sales for the first half. Chief executive Gavin Darby is under pressure to improve the firm\u2019s performance after rejecting a \u00a31.5bn takeover offer from US rival McCormick last year. This week McCormick agreed to buyer Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s food business for $4.2bn (\u00a33.2bn). Premier shares rose by 2.6% to 39.75p. McCormick offered to pay 65p a share for the company in April 2016.",

    "webTitle": "British Airways cabin crew extend strike into August holiday peak", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Striking British Airways cabin crew have announced a further two weeks of action for the first half of August in their battle over pay and sanctions at the airline. Crew in the lower-paid mixed fleet working out of Heathrow started the latest 14-day walkout on 19 July, their 46th day on strike since January, meaning a month of strikes will now take place during the summer holiday peak. BA has said it has so far flown every booked passenger to their destination during the strikes, by merging departures, leasing planes and crew from outside, and rebooking onto other airlines. The mixed fleet crew represent about one-third of BA\u2019s total cabin staff, and around 60% of them are in the Unite union. A British Airways spokesman said: \u201cAs during Unite\u2019s previous industrial action, we will ensure all our customers reach their destinations. \u201cInstead of calling further completely unnecessary strikes, Unite should allow its members a vote on the pay deal we reached two months ago.\u201d Unite believes the extended action will soon leave BA unable to fill holes in rosters as non-striking crew \u2013 including some drafted in from other departments \u2013 reach a legal maximum on flying hours. The dispute started over pay for cabin crew, which starts at \u00a312,100 in basic salary, but is pushed above \u00a321,000 with bonuses and allowances, according to BA \u2013 a figure disputed by Unite, which says many crew members make around \u00a316,000. A potential deal was rebuffed because of sanctions against crew who had been involved in strikes, including the loss of bonuses and travel perks. Anger has been exacerbated by BA explicitly paying non-striking crew \u00a3250 drawn from money saved on crew bonuses.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Asia have reached their highest point for nearly 10 years bolstered by a surge in stock markets around the world on the back of strong US corporate earnings. As investors awaited the European Central Bank meeting for clues on its policy outlooks, the MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.15%, hovering near its highest level since December 2007. In Japan, the Nikkei gained 0.1% to climb closer to a two year high. Australian stocks rose 0.3% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi advanced 0.15%. Hong Kong was up 0.3% while the Shanghai Composite was up 0.2%. The MSCI world index rose for its tenth straight session on Thursday and set a record high for the sixth consecutive day, lifted by all-time closing highs on Wall Street. The FTSE100 in London was set to open up around 24 points, or 0.33%, according to futures trading. \u201cIn the US, the earnings season seems to be surprising a little bit on the upside,\u201d said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. \u201cWhat we have seen recently in the economic reports suggests it should be even better overseas... So we have come to the point where things look pretty good in the U.S. and it looks even better in prospect overseas, so what\u2019s not to like about equities,\u201d he said. The yen was marginally stronger at 111.83 to the dollar early on Thursday. The Bank of Japan ended its two-day policy meeting on Thursday by keeping rates on hold but cut its inflation forecasts again. The euro was up about 0.1% at $1.1528 early on Thursday, after scaling a 14-month high this week following seemingly hawkish comments by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. At Thursday\u2019s meeting, the central bank may drop a reference to its readiness to increase the size or duration of its asset-purchase programme before announcing in the autumn how and when it will start winding down its bond buying. \u201cThe euro has surged enormously on the back of hopes that the ECB is going to start the process of shutting the door on loose monetary policy,\u201d Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets UK, wrote in a note. \u201cThe ECB needs to be clear about its forward guidance and it should reinforce that in a subtle manner. Coming out of the gates too aggressively would create shock waves in the market.\u201d The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of trade-weighted peers, was steady at 94.762. The Australian dollar revisited Wednesday\u2019s two-year high early on Thursday, still heady from the minutes of the last Reserve Bank of Australia meeting, released on Tuesday, which showed the central bank had turned more upbeat on the economic outlook. The Canadian dollar was flat on Thursday at C$1.2601 to the dollar. On Wednesday, it touched a 14-month high on record domestic factory sales and higher oil prices. Oil prices, which hit a two-week peak on Wednesday on a bigger-than-expected weekly draw in crude and gasoline inventories in the US, were marginally lower early on Thursday. U.S. crude fell less than 0.1% to $47.10 a barrel, after jumping 1.6% overnight. Gold rose about 0.1 percent to $1,241.06 an ounce on Thursday.",
