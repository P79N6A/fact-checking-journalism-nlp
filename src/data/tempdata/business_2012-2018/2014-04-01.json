      "bodyText": "We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 GM CEO Mary Barra apologized for deaths linked to an ignition switch the company knew was flawed but failed to replace or to inform consumers about for more than 10 years. \u2022 Under direct questioning about whether GM accepted responsibility for the fatalities, Barra dodged. \"I again want to reiterate, we think the situation is tragic, and we apologize,\" she said. \u2022 Barra repeatedly professed ignorance of the details of internal GM decision-making, saying she was waiting for the results of an internal investigation. \u2022 Barra said she did not know why GM had continued to use the switches after engineers determined they did not meet the company's specifications, and she said she did not know why GM had not assigned a new part number to a replacement switch it began using in 2006. \u2022 \"Do you believe there was a cover-up, or was it just sloppy work?,\" asked Rep. Marsha Blackburn. Barra said that's what former US attorney Anton Valukas would be investigating to find out. \u2022 Family members of crash victims sat in the hearing room, with pictures of the victims propped along the back wall. \"I am deeply sorry,\" Barra said. Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) has filed a news story on Barra's testimony, which reads in part: But her failure to give any substantive answers failed to satisfy members of the committee, who dismissed her comments as \u201cgobbledegook\u201d and \"unacceptable\u201d. [...] Barra avoided questions about whether GM would take \u201cresponsibility\u201d for the deaths. GM emerged from bankruptcy in 2008 and is technically a new company, and therefore not liable for lawsuits related to deaths before that time. Barra announced that GM had appointed Kenneth Feinberg, a lawyer who specializes in a restitution payments in major disasters, including the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the BP oil spill, to look at the case. Read the full piece here. Friedman paints a picture of how difficult it can be for regulators, who lack internal malfunction reports of the kind GM generated, to pinpoint a problem with a car based on accident data alone. Chairman Murphy asks Friedman why NHTSA was convinced that an investigation of Chevy Cobalt airbags was not warranted. Friedman says \"the core piece of information that they relied on... was an analysis of the injury crash complaints associated airbag non-deployment... when the team did that comparison, the Cobalt did not stand out. It was a little bit above average.\" Murphy says NHTSA raised a red flag twice about the Cobalt. Why wasn't any action taken? \"Folks were trying to understand why the airbags did not deploy\" Friedman says. \"... special crash investigations were inconclusive... because these crashes happened in offroad conditions, with unbelted occupants.\" Friedman is testifying. \"Our employees go to work every day trying to prevent tragedies just like these,\" he says. Barra is done testifying. Up next is David Friedman, acting adminisrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In an advance copy of his opening statement [pdf], Friedman blames GM for mishandling the ignition switch problem: GM first provided NHTSA a chronology of events on February 24, 2014. The information in GM\u2019s chronology raises serious questions as to the timeliness of GM\u2019s recall. [...] Had the information newly provided to NHTSA by GM been available before now, it would have better informed the agency\u2019s prior reviews of airbag non-deployment in GM vehicles and likely would have changed NHTSA\u2019s approach to this issue. Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, apologizes for being late, \"but my plane was delayed for mechanical issues, probably an ignition switch.\" No audible laughter in the hearing room in response to the joke. Terry: What is the difference between non-compliance [with NHTSA] versus a defect? Barra: That's a very broad question. Terry: No, it's a very specific question. Barra: ... The hearing has taken a detour, temporary it is hoped, of Congress members reminiscing about cars they have owned and the operations of their ignitions. Barra's repeated professions of ignorance about just how GM works might be more plausible if she were not a second-generation, 33-year-veteran of the company. Her expressions of interest in what the company's internal investigation will discover come off as a bit too ingenuous, as if she'd commissioned a lunar mission. \"I want to know that as much as you,\" she has told the committee. GM stock is not doing much. Barra is a little too wishy-washy for Rep. Jan Schakowsky's tastes in reply to Schakowsky's question, \"Does GM accept responsiblity?\" The point of the question is that the current GM, after its declaration of bankruptcy, it technically a new business entity which is not clearly liable for fatal mistakes under the old company. Barra's answer shows she understands the importance of not outright accepting \"responsibility\": \"I again want to reiterate, we think the situation is tragic, and we apologize,\" Barra says. Schakowsky presses. Do you accept responsibility, and even liability? she asks. \"Do you take responsibility? Is the company responsible? The new GM, is it responsible?\" Barra says the company recognizes a moral responsibility and would act right by its customers. Which would be a change. Vice chairman Mike Burgess of Texas is narrating the painful details of fatal accidents in which Cobalt airbags failed to deploy, in some cases in head-on accidents with cars whose airbags did deploy, apparently saving lives. \"Again, it's a tragic situation, any time there's a loss of life in a traffic situation,\" Barra says. \"I can't answer your questions, because it's usually complex as they look at that.\" Then Barra again promises big changes at GM: It was a tragedy and we have apologized.. and that's why we're doing an investigation, to complete a full timeline... and I commit to you, we will take action. From the Comments: a passage from the movie Fight Club, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk: Fight Club is, of course, strictly a work of fiction. Barra seems a little flustered under questioning by Democrat Bruce Braley, who asks, \"Hasn't the core value of GM always been that safety comes first?\" \"I haven't seen that part before,\" Barra says. Barra says she doesn't know how many parts GM uses that don't meet the company's own specifications: \"I don't know,\" she says...\"The parts that we're using today meet the performance [standards] that they need to ... If we find a part that does not meet the performance, we then do a recall.\" That's not an acceptable answer, Rep. Joe Barton of Texas says. \"There's no reason to have specifications if you don't enforce them.\" As GM CEO Mary Barra continues her congressional testimony, here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Barra claimed ignorance of many details of her company's handling of the flawed ignition switch problem, repeatedly saying that she was waiting to find out what happened from an ongoing internal investigation. \u2022 Committee members showed some frustration with Barra's claims of ignorance. \"By the way ma'am, I'm getting this information from the chronology GM provided to NHTSA,\" ranking member Diana DeGette of Colorado said. \u2022 Barra could not explain why GM continued to use the ignition switch after it was determined not to meet GM specifications, and could not explain why, when GM replaced the part, the company did not assign it a new part number. \"I want to know that as much as you,\" Barra told the committee. \u2022 Barra apologized to the family members of the victims of crashes involving faulty GM parts, which have been linked to 13 deaths. \"I am deeply sorry,\" she said. Blackburn asks Barra about the decision not to issue a new part number. \"It is inconceivable, it is not our process and it is not acceptable,\" Barra says. \"Do you believe there was a cover-up, or was it just sloppy work?,\" asks Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Barra says that's why she has hired former US attorney Anton Valukas, to find that out. Full committee ranking member Henry Waxman of California asks Barra, \"How can you assure customers that new switches will finally meet GM compliance?\" \"We will do 100% end-of-line testing to make sure the ... functionality of these switches are safe,\" Barra says. But Barra is pleading ignorance so frequently that Murphy jumps in: \"Did you review the documents that GM submitted to the committee?\" \"I did not,\" says Barra. \"There were over 200,000.\" GM stock is up slightly, around .3%, on the day. Family members of victims are in the hearing room for Barra's testimony. Chairman Upton asks who inside GM decided not to use a new part number for the replacement switch, the perception being that a new part number was not assigned to cover up the fact that the part had been replaced. \"I do not know the name of the individual,\" Barra says... \"That is an unacceptable practice. That is not the way we do business.\" Barra's last two answers to questions about how GM handled internal reports of the failing switch: \"I was not a part of that organization at the time, that's why I'm doing an investigation.\" \"I don't know the people who would have been handling that issue at that point.\" Barra's strategy: \"Not my fault but I'll fix it\" \u2013 and for as long as this hearing shall last, I have no idea about the specifics. Ranking member DeGette is annoyed that Barra won't admit to even the basics of what GM knew when, despite the fact that many of the details under discussion come from GM's own internal reports. \"By the way ma'am, I'm getting this information from the chronology GM provided to NHTSA,\" DeGette says. Barra: \"That's part of our investigation to get that complete timeline. DeGette: Well much of this I'm getting from a timeline that GM has already done. Barra: Which is a summary. Murphy is drilling down on when GM decided to manufacture a new switch \u2013 without changing the part number. Murphy quotes an internal finding that \"Cobalt is blowing up in their face.\" Why didn't GM mount a recall at the time, 2006, Murphy asks? Barra shows she's not willing to say much about what happened years ago inside GM. She refers repeatedly to the ongoing investigation: \"Clearly there were a lot of things that happened.. there were a lot of statements made. That's why we're hiring [former US attorney] Anton Valukas [..] I do not know the answer to that, and that's why we're doing this investigation... I can't answer specific questions at this time, that's why we're doing a full investigation.\" Barra says she's prepared for questions. Chairman Murphy goes first. \"Is it common practice for GM to accept a part that it does not meet its specifications?\" No, Barra says. But sometimes a parts purchase \u2013 such as steel, she says \u2013 might not be up to spec, but would be acceptable from \"a safety, functionality, performance\" perspective. Barra promises that GM will do better: I would like this committee to know that all of our GM employees and I are determined to set a new standard. And I am encouraged to say that everyone at GM\u2014up to and including our Board of Directors\u2014supports this. If you haven't yet read Guardian US finance and economics editor Heidi Moore's (@moorehn) take on that particular promise, you can find it here. It reads in part: Less than four months later, it seems foolish that any of GM\u2019s fairy tale was believable to anyone. After the recalls and the estimates of driver deaths, all of that talk \u2013 of the reborn American automaker, of bets paid and dollars won \u2013 seems like a hollow spectacle. And it has to make us wonder: how much were US taxpayers and the government complicit in sustaining a company that researchers had already suggested was unable to compete in the modern automotive industry? Barra's opening testimony is here [pdf]. As previously announced, GM will hire a former US attorney to conduct an internal investigation into how the company handled the switch problem. Barra testified: I\u2019ve asked former U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas to conduct a thorough and unimpeded investigation of the actions of General Motors. He has free rein to go where the facts take him, regardless of the outcome. The facts will be the facts. Once they are in, my management team and I will use his findings to help assure this does not happen again. We will hold ourselves fully accountable. Barra has modified the top of her opening testimony slightly, inserting a sentence about how the ignition switch problems \"did not happen on my watch.\" Otherwise it reads verbatim: More than a decade ago, GM embarked on a small car program. Sitting here today, I cannot tell you why it took years for a safety defect to be announced in that program, but I can tell you that we will find out. When we have answers, we will be fully transparent with you, with our regulators, and with our customers. A Cobalt. Barra is about to begin her testimony. Energy and commerce committee chair Fred Upton asks the big question: \"Why did it take so long to issue the recall?\" \"It was news reports that brought the problem to the nation's attention,\" Upton says. \"This investigation is indeed bipartisan.\" \"I know we have a lot of family members here Mr Chairman,\" DeGette says. \"We're going to get to the bottom of this. We're going to figure out what happened, and we're going to make sure it doesn't happen again.\" According to advance copies of Barra's testimony [pdf], she will apologize to family members and loved ones of victims with these words: Today\u2019s GM will do the right thing... That begins with my sincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall... especially to the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured. I am deeply sorry. Ranking member DeGette has brought along a GM ignition switch. She holds it up. \"I just want to show how easy it is to turn this key in this switch,\" she says, jiggling the key in the ignition and showing it switching off. The defective switch was especially a problem, she says, for short driver whose knees were more likely to contact the ignition, and for people who had heavy keychains or \"mom keychains like me.\" Chairman Murphy is working through a timeline of GM's misdeeds, as investigated by the committee. The NHTSA is not spared criticism. \"NHTSA ultimately decided not to investigate, even when the issue was raised three years later, in 2010 \u2013 NHTSA decided against investigating,\" Murphy says. Barra is likely to bear the brunt of the tough questioning in the hearing, but it could get pretty uncomfortable for Friedman too. Barra and Friedman, the NHTSA director, are testifying today before the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, chaired by Republican Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania and with ranking member Diana DeGette of Colorado. They're about to begin. You can watch a live video stream on C-SPAN3 here. The daughter of a GM worker, Barra joined the company at 18 and served as global head of product development before ascending to her current post, Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) wrote in a profile published in December: The company said the 51-year-old Barra had risen through a series of manufacturing, engineering, and senior staff positions in her 33 years with GM. [...] Barra earned her bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Kettering University \u2013 formerly the General Motors Institute \u2013 in Flint, Michigan. She also holds an MBA from Stanford. Barra grew up in Waterford, a suburb of Detroit. Her father worked for 39 years as a GM dye maker. Read the full piece here. Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe (@domincru) writes up six questions that GM CEO Mary Barra is likely to face: 1: What did you know? Barra started working for GM age 18. In 2008 she became vice president of global manufacturing engineering. She moved into human resources but then back into engineering overseeing global product development, purchasing and the supply chain. What did she know of problems with GM\u2019s ignitions and air bags on the Chevrolet Cobalt and other vehicles? What did she do about them? 2: Why didn\u2019t GM make the recalls earlier given evidence the company knew there mounting reports of accidents and deaths going back as far as 2004? 3: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration administrator David Friedman said in his testimony that GM had \u201ccritical information\u201d that was not passed on to the regulator. What was that information, why was it withheld and who withheld it? Read the full piece here. Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe points to an NPR timeline of the recall scandal. Here are the first three entries: 2001: GM detects the defect during pre-production testing of the Saturn Ion. 2003: A service technician closes an inquiry into a stalling Saturn Ion after changing the key ring and noticing the problem was fixed. 2004: GM recognizes the defect again as the Chevrolet Cobalt replaces the Cavalier. There are 30 further damning timeline entries where those came from, including these: March 2005: GM rejects a proposal to fix the problem because it would be too costly and take too long. July 29, 2005: Maryland resident Amber Marie Rose, 16, dies when her 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt crashes into a tree after the ignition switch shuts down the car's electrical system and the air bags fail to deploy. Read the full timeline here. What's Barra's apology worth? On its face, not much, says Guardian US finance and economics editor Heidi Moore (@moorehn). Barra is to testify that \u201ctoday\u2019s GM will do the right thing,\u201d Heidi writes \u2013 But there is a dark undercurrent to her words, which will only highlight a truth that is no longer excusable: General Motors spent over a decade misleading the public about mechanical failures in its cars, working to create the false image of a rehabilitated powerhouse of American industry. And it will make you wonder what else GM hasn\u2019t told us \u2013 indeed, what it doesn\u2019t even know yet \u2013 about its $55bn business. \"GM has been good at telling stories that the public wants to hear,\" Heidi writes. Read the full piece here. Today's hearing is titled \"The GM Ignition Switch Recall: Why Did It Take So Long?\" It's an extraordinary test for the newly installed Barra, who became CEO of General Motors less than three months ago. Since then the company has recalled millions of vehicles, apologized for deaths resulting from flaws in those vehicles, estimated its quarterly costs tied to the recall at $750m and faced the prospect of two congressional investigations and potentially hundreds of lawsuits. Last month Barra appeared in a web video announcing steps GM was taking to address the manufacturing flaw and the company's handling of it: \"Something went wrong with our process in this instance, and terrible things happened,\" Barra says. \"We have apologized. But that is just one step in the journey to resolve this.\" Welcome to our live blog coverage of General Motors CEO Mary Barra\u2019s testimony before a US House of Representatives committee investigating the automaker\u2019s handling of a vehicle flaw now linked to 13 deaths. Congressional investigators say GM neglected to warn customers for more than 10 years about faulty ignition switches capable of disabling airbags in Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion vehicles. GM has recalled 2.6m vehicles for ignition-switch defects and an additional 1.3m vehicles to fix a power-steering issue. Barra will apologize to families of victims and promise a thorough internal investigation, according to testimony submitted to the committee [pdf]. Barra plans to testify in part: More than a decade ago, GM embarked on a small car program. Sitting here today, I cannot tell you why it took years for a safety defect to be announced in that program, but I can tell you that we will find out. Families of three teenagers killed or injured in a 2006 car crash involving a 2005 Cobalt have sued GM for negligence and fraud for not disclosing facts about the defects. The House and Senate are conducting investigations of possible criminal conduct at GM, which expects recall-related repairs to cost $750m this quarter and which could face hundreds of additional lawsuits.

In the current austerity climate, it is surely vital that every available pound is both collected and spent on the correct priorities. Pete Radcliffe Warrington, Cheshire",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne, on Tuesday told the Financial Conduct Authority it should consider disciplinary action against staff after last week's botched announcement of an investigation into the insurance sector. Putting renewed pressure on the new City watchdog's chief executive, Martin Wheatley, the chancellor used unusually strong language, saying he was profoundly concerned about the events that led to \u00a36bn being wiped off the share prices of the UK's biggest insurance firms on Friday. The share sell-off followed a senior FCA director Clive Adamson being quoted in the Daily Telegraph on plans to review 30m policies going back decades and the potential scrapping of exit fees on such policies. The story sent shudders through the stock market but the FCA then failed to clarify the scope of its inquiry until six hours after trading opened. Wheatley said he had no intention of resigning from the \u00a3600,000-a-year job he formally took on a year ago when the new regulator was broken out of the former Financial Services Authority. But Osborne's unexpected intervention on Tuesday led to speculation that senior FCA jobs were on the line. The Treasury \u2013 which appointed Wheatley \u2013 released a letter to the FCA chairman, John Griffith-Jones, in which Osborne wrote: \"These events go to the heart of the FCA's responsibilty for the integrity and good order of UK financial markets, and have been damaging both to the FCA as an institution and to the UK's reputation for regulatory stability and competence.\" Griffith-Jones replied to say that the FCA shared those concerns and would \"do everything possible to address that harm by setting up an independent inquiry\". As Osborne, who is to appear before Treasury select committee on Thursday to talk about the budget, also received a letter from the Association of British Insurers demanding that the promised investigation by the FCA was truly independent. Signed by Tidjane Thiam, the boss of Prudential who is also chair of the ABI, the letter called for the industry, its regulators and the government \"sit down and have a longer term dialogue about how we can work together in future\". Wheatley, in a series of interviews on Tuesday to mark the moment that the FCA took on regulation of consumer credit, acknowledged that last Friday was not the regulator's \"finest hour\" \u2013 repeating what he had told a City audience on Monday. But he also said he did not consider resigning. \"Yes, I will stay in my job. We've got a big job to do,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. The FCA boss is expected to be in Westminster on Wednesday to host a reception with parliamentarians to explain the new approach to regulating the credit industry, previously overseen by the Office of Fair Trading. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, has already described last week's release of information as an \"extraordinary blunder\". He said he intended to call before his committee the individual appointed to oversee the FCA inquiry to explain the regulator's actions. \"The Treasury committee will want to see the independent reviewer before he or she gets to work and before the terms of reference are finalised,\" Tyrie said. Osborne welcomed the FCA's decision to hold an inquiry, but set out seven questions to be answered, including who authorised the briefing and \"where senior accountability should lie and what disciplinary action should be taken\".",

It's impossible to see through to the absolute end. It's not going to be over any time soon. It's been a great six years and it's appropriate that someone takes it on to the next phase,\" he told the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference.

      "bodyText": "Heathrow has started the search for a new chief executive after announcing that Colin Matthews is to stand down after six years running Britain's largest arport. Matthews joined in March 2008 in the wake of the shambolic Terminal 5 opening and has overseen a gradual restoration of Heathrow's reputation, although he presided over one public relations disaster in December 2010 when a snow flurry paralysed the airport. As well as operating Britain's main international gateway, his successor faces a tough political challenge in persuading the three main parties to back a new runway \u2013 an option being considered by the independent airports commission. Matthews said he had decided the time was right to \"pass on the baton\" and will leave after the new Terminal 2 is opened in June. \"I'll be 70 by the time the thing [a new runway] opens. It's impossible to see through to the absolute end. It's not going to be over any time soon. It's been a great six years and it's appropriate that someone takes it on to the next phase,\" he told the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference. The most prominent internal candidate is the development director, John Holland-Kaye, who is charged with the Terminal 2 revamp, but previous appointments have come from outside the airport group, which dropped its former title of BAA when Heathrow sold its other London airports Stansted and Gatwick. Under Matthews customer satisfaction has increased markedly at Heathrow. According to the airport's statistics, the proportion of passengers rating their journey through Heathrow as good or excellent went up from less than 50% to more than 75%. After its opening day fiasco, when undertrained staff grappled with a new baggage system leading to hundreds of flight cancellations, Terminal 5 has established itself as one of the world's finest airport terminals. Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Heathrow, said: \"Colin has done a fantastic job of improving Heathrow for passengers and will remain as chief executive until his successor is in place to ensure a smooth transition.\" While Heathrow's performance was not blemish-free in the first half of Matthews' tenure \u2013 notably over Christmas 2010 when five inches of snow caused chaos \u2013 \u2013 it avoided a potential pitfall with a smooth operation during the Olympics.

There is plenty more lobbying, consultation and wooing of public opinion ahead. 2 Avoid disruption Even if Heathrow eventually gets a new runway, it is going to be operating at the limit of landings and take-offs for the next decade or so, making it vulnerable to severe disruption. A mild winter has kept cancellations to a minimum, but the flooding debacle at Gatwick in January is a reminder of how the weather can test the best-laid plans.

      "bodyText": "European stock markets have begun April on the front foot, with the major indices all gaining ground today. The slowdown in manufacturing growth in the eurozone (see here) UK (see here) didn't stop shares rising in Europe. In London the FTSE 100 hit a three-week high, led by insurers and banks. Mining stocks also did well, on hopes that the Chinese government will make further stimulus measures soon (especially after today's PMI data - see 8.05am). Closing prices: FTSE 100: up 54 points at 6652, +0.8% French CAC: up 35 points at 4426, +0.8% - Highest close since September 2008 German DAX: up 47 points at 9603, + 0.5% Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, says it's been a busy day (indeed!): We\u2019ve barely been able to pause for breath all day, such has been the flood of economic data (and the endless April Fools jokes). However, the quarter has kicked off on a strong note for markets, with Chinese stimulus talk and appropriately soothing words from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen [see here] helping to lift the mood. And I'm going to lift my mood further, by signing off. A reminder of the key points: Eurozone finance ministers have agreed that Greece should receive its next aid tranche, but \u20ac2bn is being held back until various targets have been hit. The eurozone's unemployment rate remains at a near record-high of 11.9% in February, with just 35,000 people dropping off the jobless total. Manufacturing activity growth in the eurozone slowed a little in March.... ....and slowed by a little more in the UK. US factory output bounced back, though, after the winter storms, but not by as much as some had expected. While China's small factories are suffering falling activity as domestic demand weakens -- suggesting Beijing may have to 'finetune' its economic programme Back tomorrow. Thanks, and goodnight. GW Reuters reports that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has won a legal victory, with a judge rejecting a lawsuit over the phone hacking scandal. However, the plaintiffs have been given the opportunity to refile the complaint, it appears. Here are the newswire snaps: NEWS CORP WINS DISMISSAL OF U.S. SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT OVER PHONE HACKING SCANDAL -- COURT RULING RUPERT MURDOCH, REBEKAH BROOKS, OTHER INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ALSO WIN DISMISSAL OF CLAIMS AGAINST THEM U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE PAUL GARDEPHE IN MANHATTAN SAYS WILL GIVE PLAINTIFFS A CHANCE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT BY APRIL 30 Capital Economics, meanwhile, reckons today's \"trivial increase\" in US factory output growth shows that the sector is \"slowly recovering\" from the weather-related disruption at the start of the year. That suggests US economic growth will pick up gradually in the next few months, they suggest. Here's some key points from their research note: The new orders index nudged up to 55.1, from 54.5. Meanwhile, despite the ongoing weakness in Chinese manufacturing activity, overseas demand has also appeared to have improved. The new export orders index rose to 55.5, from 53.5, with the increase a bit more pronounced in seasonally adjusted terms. After plunging to 48.2 in February due to the exceptionally cold weather, the rebound in the production index to a three-month high of 55.9 was quite encouraging. At face value, this level is now consistent with manufacturing output growth of roughly 3% annualised. One weak spot, however, remains to be the employment index, which fell to 51.1 in March from 52.3, and suggests some downside risk to our forecast that official non-farm payrolls increased by as much as 200,000 last month (data due this Friday). CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler says that today's US manufacturing data was \"nicely mediocre\" -- better than the previous month, but not quite as good as expected. That, he explains, is why the S&amp;P hit a new record high: In a way, the ISM data is nicely mediocre, not too impressive to prevent continued Fed easing but not bad enough to really rock the US recovery. Another stock market record - France's CAC index just hit its highest level since September 2008, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The index of blue-chip French firms has gained 45 points, or 1%, today to 4435. Traders in Paris appear to welcome the appointment of Manuel Valls as France's new prime minister. Valls is seen as a more centrist, Blair-like figure, compared to Jean-Marc Ayrault - who resigned after the Socialists suffered one of the biggest drubbings on French soil since 25 October 1415 (or, for balance, 18 June 1429) America's S&amp;P 500 index has just hit a new record high, on the back of the ISM manufacturing data (see last post). The S&amp;P climbed to a new intraday peak of 1,884 points in early trading on Wall Street. Update: I initially thought the S&amp;P had jumped because the ISM index had risen. But some analysts had expected it to rise even more -- so there's an element of 'bad news is good news' here too, as it perhaps means US monetary policy might take a little longer to normalise. Especially as a separate survey of construction data showed hardly any growth at all in February, after a weak January. Shares are also pushing higher in London, where the FTSE 100 is up 56 points or nearly 0.9% at 6654. More manufacturing data --- and America's factory sector has posted faster growth in March. The Institute for Supply Management's survey of the sector rose to 53.7, up from 53.2 -- showing that growth accelerated last month. That also shows faster expansion than the eurozone (whose manufacturing PMI came in at 53.0 this morning), but below the UK's 55.3. US factories reported a surge in output, and new orders, which suggests the American economy began spring in pretty decent shape after the disruption caused by last winter's storms. Former government minister (and ex-EU trade commissioner) Peter Mandelson was in uncompromising mood today, telling a conference in London that Britain would be \"stark staring bonkers\" to quit the European Union: Lord Mandelson: Britain 'bonkers' to leave European Union This bolsters the argument that Greece may be turning the corner; there are reports that Athens is planning to issue a five-year bond. The WSJ has the details, reporting that officials want to 'build momentum' ahead of a full return to the financial markets in future. Greece is planning to issue its first long-term bond since it secured its bailout in May 2010, three senior euro-zone officials with knowledge of the situation said Tuesday. Greece wants to issue a three-to-five-year bond by June and plans to raise about \u20ac4 billion to \u20ac5 billion ($5.5 billion to $6.9 billion) on financial markets by the end of the year, taking advantage of improved market sentiment for troubled euro-zone countries such as Portugal, the officials said. Greece's finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, has declared that the Athens government has \"turned the economy around\" after a long battle, but many readers aren't convinced. Writing on the Guardian's Comment Is Free site today, Stournaras insisted that Greece will return to growth this year: Here's the piece. And here's a flavour: According to the latest estimates, in 2014 Greece will return to positive rates of growth after six years of deep recession. In the years to follow Greece is expected to experience robust growth rates that will gradually rise. Confidence is being restored. The economic sentiment indicator has reached the highest level in the last five years. The spread of the Greek 10-year government bond compared with the German bund has fallen below 550 basis points, whereas at the peak of the crisis it surpassed 3,000 basis points. In January, the purchasing managers' index (PMI) exceeded the threshold of 50, indicating expansion for the first time since August 2009. That was written before March's data, released this morning, showed factory activity fell again last month (see 9.24am). As flagged up at 2.06pm, Brussels also believes Greece will start growing again this year. But some regular Guardian readers aren't letting Stournaras get away with too much triumphalism. Not that Greece had any easy choices.... Italy's newish prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is in London today - meeting with prime minister David Cameron now: Back to Greece, and the EC has released comments made by commissioner Olli Rehn in Athens today. Rehn told reporters that the Greek economy was 'stabilising', and would (at long last) exit recession this year. We all know how difficult this adjustment has been and how great are the challenges faced by many Greek citizens still today. I would like to take this opportunity of being here in Athens to acknowledge the great efforts made by Greece over the past four years to repair the public finances and build a more sustainable model for growth and job creation. There was no easy way to resolve the problems confronting Greece in 2010, given the scale of economic imbalances that had built up, over so many years. But what we can say is that European solidarity and Greek determination came together to ensure that a far worse outcome was avoided. Today, the Greek economy is stabilising and we expect a return to growth and a gradual recovery in employment starting this year. To strengthen this recovery and boost job creation, it will be essential for Greece to continue to embrace economic reforms, maintain sound public finances and facilitate targeted investments. The European Commission will continue to stand by Greece and support Greece in creating the conditions for sustainable growth, as we have until now through the programme and through technical assistance provided by the Task Force for Greece. The full statement, which also touched on the situation in Ukraine, is here: Speaking points by Vice-President Olli Rehn at the Eurogroup Press Conference I failed to flag this up amid the morning data splurge, but it's worth mentioning now -- policymakers at the Bank of England are worried that investors are too complacent about the prospect of interest rates rising. The warning came from the Bank's Financial Policy Committee. The minutes of its last meeting, released this morning, show that the FPC is concerned that the markets haven't priced in the full consequences of exiting the current loose monetary conditions. Members were concerned that there was a risk that [the] apparent resilience to past developments in advanced economy monetary policy could reinforce risk appetite in a way that did not fully take account of the eventual transition of monetary policy to more normal settings Investors 'too relaxed' about rising interest rates, Bank of England warns An unexpected departure at Heathrow -- chief executive Colin Matthews has announced his resignation. His six-year stint at the UK's biggest airport began with the Terminal 5 fiasco, and will end when Terminal 2 has (we hope) been reopened in June. Heathrow airport boss Colin Matthews resigns after six years ...and here's Conservative MP Ben Gummer tweeting that the FCA must take action against those payday lenders who lure customers onto 'extortionate' rates: Speaking of the FCA....it has also taken control of payday lenders today, and is expected to take a tough line with an industry accused of profiteering from Britain's cost of living crisis and driving families deeper into debt. One trade body reckons 50% of payday lenders could quit the market, once the FCA gets its teeth into them: Half of all payday lenders could be 'taken out of the market' Have your say.... Who is to blame for the botched Royal Mail shares sell-off? - poll Chancellor George Osborne has piled further pressure on the UK's City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, and its chief executive Martin Wheatley. Osborne has written to the FCA's chairman to say he is \"profoundly concerned\" by the way the FCA announced plans for a probe into the UK life insurance industry last Friday. That botched announcement (which began with an ill-advised leak to the Telegraph), sent share prices crumbling before the regulators (eventually) issued a clarification hours later. Wheatley toured the radio studios this morning, admitting that it had not been the FCA's \"finest hour\", but insisted he won't resign...... George Osborne 'profoundly concerned' by FCA insurance leak Heads-up: The controversial Royal Mail privatisation will be discussed in parliament in a few moments. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has been granted an urgent question, following the National Audit's revelations that last autumn's IPO could have raised an extras \u00a3750m. Our politics liveblogger Andy Sparrow will be covering it here. That NAO report (our story is here) has dominated the political sphere today - with unions and some analysts lambasting business secretary Vince Cable for, in their view, botching the float. Here's a flavour: Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem also told reporters in Athens that it is \"too early\" to say whether Greece will need another aid package. He also warned French president Francois Hollande that he cannot be given any more time to hit the EU's debt targets (it already has a two-year extension). Reuters has the details: EUROGROUP'S DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS GREECE HAS AN AMBITION NOT TO ASK FOR ANOTHER BAILOUT, BUT IT IS TOO EARLY TO SAY IF THIS WILL BE POSSIBLE EUROGROUP'S DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS FRANCE IS WELL AWARE OF ITS COMMITMENTS, WAS ALREADY GIVEN MORE TIME, NEW FRENCH CABINET WILL BE AWARE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS EUROGROUP'S DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS FRANCE HAS TO DELIVER ON ITS COMMITMENTS UNDER EU BUDGET RULES Last night, Hollande issued a plea to Brussels, saying he did not want to make savings that would sacrifice growth (details here) Brussels, though, has snubbed him. Here's what Dijsselbloem told the press conference: \"France is aware of its commitments, they were already given more time and more work needs to be done. I'm sure new French government will be aware of its obligations,\". Eurozone finance ministers have also postponed a decision on what future aid or assistance Portugal might need, until after this May's European elections. Speaking in Athens, Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said that ministers won't consider Portugal's exit strategy this month. He told journalists: \"Portugal's recovery is strengthening. Stabilisation of the banking sector is progressing \"We will discuss Portugal's exit strategy at our May meeting.\" The WSJ reported last night that the decision to defer the Portugal question was \"a bit messy\", according to one official. Lisbon's bailout deal ends on May 17, and there are suggestions it could need a precautionary credit line. The decision to approve Greece's next bailout payment removes the danger that it wouldn't have enough money for its next debt repayment, and ends months of brinkmanship between the two sides. But most of the money will flow quickly back out of Athens, as the FT's Peter Spiegel points out: The bailout tranche of \u20ac8.3bn divided into three payments comes just in time to help repay a \u20ac9bn bond held by the European Central Bank that is due in May. Peter's early take is here. It's official, Greece will receive its next aid payment, worth over \u20ac8bn -- but it will be split into three payments. Over in Athens, eurozone finance minister have agreed that Athens has done enough to earn the next slice of its bailout. In a statement just released, the eurogroup said it \"reiterates its appreciation for the efforts made by the Greek citizens\" , and welcomed the news that the bailout programme is \"on track\". However, it is only proposing disbursing \u20ac6.3bn right now. The remaining \u20ac2bn will be split into two \u20ac1bn slices, which will only be handed over if Greece implements further milestones agreed with the Troika. In a statement, the eurogroup also urged Athens to continue with its reform programme - just days after the government narrowly won a vote over its austerity plans. The statement is online here - here's the key section: The reform process will have to continue in order to enhance the growth potential of the Greek economy by creating job opportunities and a healthy investment environment. In this context, the Eurogroup welcomes the authorities' strong commitment to the implementation of a wide range of product (goods and services) market and institutional reforms. Concrete measures to liberalise transport and rental markets and to open up closed professions are being prepared. Bold and frontloaded cuts in social security contributions are expected to improve competitiveness and boost growth. In addition, the authorities have committed to far-reaching energy market reforms and to enhancing the privatisation of public corporate and real estate assets, which would provide financing to the government while unlocking private investment. It is also important that continued progress is made in the area of public administration reforms, in order to improve the quality and efficiency of the services that the public sector provides to its citizens, as well as with labour market reforms. A press conference is underway in Athens now - highlights to follow.... The small drop in European unemployment last month may signal a welcome recovery in the region's labour market, suggests Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He writes: Eurozone unemployment dipped by 35,000 in February. While this followed a jump of 157,000 in January, it adds to mounting evidence that Eurozone labour markets have stabilized overall and are maybe even starting to see slight improvement after extended, marked weakness. Europe's unemployment crisis has eased a little -- with the number of people out of work across the eurozone dropping by 35,000 in February. The headline jobless rate is better than feared, coming in at 11.9%. Eurostat has also revised January's figure down from 12% to 11.9%, and now believes the rate has been unchanged since October. Across the wider European Union, the jobless rate dropped to 10.6%, from 10.7% in January, with the unemployment total falling by 60,000. That means there are still 18.965m people out of work in the eurozone, and 25.92m across the EU. But there was little relief in the eurozone periphery -- Italy's jobless rate hit a fresh record high of 13%, and Spain's remained more than twice the eurozone average. Eurostat reports: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.8%), Germany (5.1%) and Luxembourg (6.1%), and the highest in Greece (27.5% in December 2013) and Spain (25.6%). While any drop in unemployment is welcome, these rates remain depressingly high. And Europe still faces a youth unemployment crisis, although the number of young people out of work has fallen over the last year. There were 5.392 million under 25's unemployed in the EU28, of whom 3.415 million were in the euro area. Eurostat adds: Compared with February 2013, youth unemployment decreased by 295 000 in the EU28 and by 194 000 in the euro area. In February 2014, the youth unemployment rate was 22.9% in the EU28 and 23.5% in the euro area, compared with 23.6% and 24.0% respectively in February 2013. And again, you stand far more chance of getting on the career ladder in the northern core of Europe: In February 2014, the lowest rates were observed in Germany (7.7%), Austria (9.4%) and the Netherlands (11.5%), and the highest in Greece (58.3% in December 2013), Spain (53.6%) and Croatia (48.8% in the fourth quarter of 2013). We also have dispiriting news on Britain's productivity - a big cause for concern in political and economic circles. My colleague Katie Allen explains: The latest official statistics on UK productivity show little turnaround from the languid growth of recent quarters. The Office for National Statistics says that on an output per hour basis, UK labour productivity increased by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and it was 0.7% higher than a year ago. Output per worker was unchanged in Q4. Manufacturing and the rest of the industrial sector enjoyed stronger growth than the UK's dominant services sector. Output per hour in service industries grew by 0.3% in the fourth quarter, and has grown or been unchanged in each quarter of 2013. Across the production industries, output per hour grew by 1.2% in the fourth quarter, reversing a fall of a similar magnitude in the previous quarter. More here. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, says today's PMI survey shows Britain's \"strong\" domestic demand is making up for weakness overseas: \u201cIn spite of softer rates of expansion, UK manufacturing held its ground in March benefitting from ongoing improved operating conditions. Leading the way to growth was the strong domestic market which, alongside robust consumer and intermediate production, was able to offset this month\u2019s slower growth in both overseas demand and the investment goods output. And according to Markit, some UK firms reported a drop in new orders from clients in the Asia-Pacific region -- perhaps another signal that China's economy is slowing? Britain's factory sector also suffered a slowdown in growth last month, driven by a worrying weakness in exports. However, the sector did continue to expand - but at its slowest rate in eight months. The UK manufacturing PMI dropped back to 55.3 in March, from February's 56.2. That is weaker than City analysts had expected, but still some way above its longterm average. The drop was due to a slower rise in output and new business. New export orders weakened further, to the slowest pace of growth for ten months. It's a sign that Britain is still struggling to rebalance its economy - a few days after the UK current account deficit widened alarmingly. Markit's Rob Dobson said: The old criticisms still apply, with the survey signalling a downturn in export growth and an expansion that is all-too reliant on domestic consumers. However, the very fact that we have a healthy manufacturing economy that is generating jobs at a rate rarely seen in recent decades suggests that the rebalancing process is underway. We may be still a consumption-oriented economy in many respects, but at least we now appear to be producing more of the goods we sell ourselves, which is a more sustainable situation to be in. The upshot of this morning's data (see 8.22am onwards) is that the Eurozone factory sector continued to expand last month, but at a lower rate than February. And there are new fears over deflation, as the prices of raw materials and finished goods dropped. The overall Eurozone manufacturing PMI, which surveys thousands of firms across the region, dropped to 53.0 in March from 53.2 in February. That shows growth, but at a slightly slower rate. France's surprise return to growth was balanced out by Germany's weaker performance. As Markit put it: Slowdowns in February\u2019s top performers \u2013 Germany, the Netherlands and Austria \u2013 were largely offset by faster growth in Ireland (35-month high), Spain (47-month high) and Italy (2-month high) and a return to expansion in France that took its PMI to a 33-month peak. \uf0a7 The Greek PMI edged back into contraction territory for the first time in three months. The survey showed that Eurozone manufacturing output, new orders and new exports all rose. However, in another warning signal to the European Central Bank, average input costs declined for the second month running and output prices also dipped. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the data underlines that the eurozone recovery isn't secure: Alongside the renewed fall in factory gate prices, signs of slower output and order book growth are a reminder that a self-sustaining recovery is not yet in place and reliant at least in part on price discounting to win sales. Such deflationary signals will continue to spook policymakers and raise the likelihood of further stimulus from the ECB. Greece's factory sector activity has slipped back into contraction as firms keep cutting jobs, and the recent growth in new orders slows. The Greek manufacturing PMI has dropped below the 50-point mark, coming in at 49.7 in March, from 51.3 in February. That's the lowest reading this year. Markit's Phil Smith said it was \"somewhat disappointing\" to see the headline PMI fall back below 50.0, in March: However, the key indices pertaining to output and new orders remained in growth territory \u2013 albeit they were lower than February\u2019s peaks \u2013 suggesting the manufacturing sector has made a positive contribution to GDP in the opening quarter. Growth in Germany's factories has fallen back, though -- with its monthly manufacturing PMI dropping to 53.7 from 54.8 in February. Although that it still healthily in 'expansion' territory (above 50), it suggests the eurozone's largest economy may have lost some zip last month. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, warned: Germany\u2019s goods producing sector lost some of its recently strong growth momentum...\uf0a7 Output and new business orders rose at sharp, albeit weaker rates, adding evidence that the manufacturing upturn has moderated slightly. With employment growth edging closer to stagnation and export growth easing to a five-month low, the data signal that there might still be a few obstacles on the path to recovery. Wowzers - France's factory sector has posted its biggest jump in output in 33 months, returning to growth for the first time in two years. French manufacturing \"sprang back to life\" last month, Markit said, perhaps calming concerns that France has become the sick man of Europe. The French manufacturing PMI jumped to 52.1, up from 49.7 in February, the highest reading since June 2011. That also ended a two-year period of continuous sub-50 readings (which showed a contraction). Employment at French manufacturers increased fractionally in March, after two years of steady job shedding. Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, which compiles the France Manufacturing PMI\u00ae survey, said: \u201cThe French manufacturing sector delivered a much improved performance in March, buoyed by solid growth of new orders. With the sector having finally moved into expansion territory following a prolonged spell of weakness, firms will be looking for signs of a convincing recovery taking hold before looking to boost areas such as employment. If input prices continue to fall, French manufacturers may look to gain a competitive edge through cutting output prices.\u201d Here comes the survey of Italy's factory sector....and it has followed Spain (see 8.35am) with another rise in activity - but no improvement on the jobs front. Italy's factory PMI rose to 52.4 in March, up from 52.3 a month ago, driven by a rise in exports. Markit, which compiled the survey, said it showed another solid increase in Italy's manufacturing output -- with new orders also up. However, there was \"negligible\" improvement in employment levels across the sector. Markit explains:\uf0a7 Another area that manufacturers targeted for streamlining was employment. While production levels rose at a solid and accelerated pace, job creation eased to the slowest in the current five- month sequence and was negligible. Only the investment goods sector saw a substantial rise in staffing numbers since February. Markit is also worried that the cost of raw materials, and finished products, both fell - suggesting Italy's economy risks sinking into deflation.... \"Also of note in March\u2019s data was the simultaneous falls in input and output prices, which further highlight the risk of deflation in Italy.\u201d Spain's factory sector continues to claw its way back from recession, with manufacturers reporting the fastest growth since April 2010. The Spanish PMI, based on interviews with purchasing managers across the country, jumped to 52.8 in March -- the fourth month in a row that it has come in above the 50-pint mark, denoting growth. Firms reported a rise in new orders, and stronger demand from clients. Markit said: Rates of expansion in both output and new orders quickened during the month, although employment growth dropped off. But the improvement hasn't yet reached Spain's troubled labour market -- staffing levels were \"broadly unchanged\" last month. And the survey also shows that eurozone inflation is sagging -- factories reported that input costs fell while output charges decreased at a moderated pace in March. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report, said: \u201cThe recent pick-up in the Spanish manufacturing sector continued in March, finishing off a solid first quarter. Sharper rises in both new and existing orders suggest that further growth of output is likely in the near-term. Input prices decreased for the second time in the past three months, highlighting a continued lack of inflationary pressure.\u201d The first European manufacturing surveys are in. They all show growth -- although it did slow in several countries. The Netherland's PMI dropped to 53.7 in March from 55.2. That indicates that its factories continued to expand last month, at a slower rate. Poland's PMI fell to 54.0, from 55.9 - also showing slower growth. Hungary slipped to 53.7, from, 54.3. But Norway posted faster growth, rising to 51.9 from 51.1 in February. Asia's stock markets have shaken off worries over China, hitting a four-month high on the back of some very dovish comments by the Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, on Monday. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares has risen 0.4%, to its highest level since December. The main Chinese indices are up around 0.6%. This follows Yellen's speech yesterday, in which she argued that the US economy and its jobs sector remained weak and would require plenty more help from the Fed . In effect, she's nimbly countered hew own suggestion, two weeks ago, that the Fed could raise interest rates in early 2015. One strategist called it \"one of the most dovish speeches I have ever read\". Medium-sized and small firms in China are continuing to struggle to grow, adding to concerns that the Chinese economy is losing steam. HSBC's China manufacturing PMI survey, which focuses on smaller private companies, showed that activity contracted for the third month in a row in March, at the fastest rate in eight months. It fell to just 48.0 in March, down from 48.5 in February, showing \"a moderate deterioration of the health of the sector\". Any reading under 50 shows a contraction, and this is the biggest fall since July 2013. Firms reported that output and new orders both fell, at a faster rate, while workforce numbers also fell. The survey suggests that China's domestic economy is still cooling, as new business from abroad rose for the first time in four months. Hongbin Qu, chief economist at HSBC, argued that China's government needs to take further stimulus measures soon: \u201cThe final reading of the HSBC China Manufacturing PMI in March confirmed the weakness of domestic demand conditions. This implies that 1Q GDP growth is likely to have fallen below the annual growth target of 7.5%. We expect Beijing to fine-tune policy sooner rather than later to stabilise growth.\u201d Here's the details: Key points Both output and new orders contract at faster rates... ...while new export orders return to growth Input costs and output charges both fall sharply Confusingly, the 'official' Chinese PMI survey was a little more positive - inching higher to 50.3 in March from 50.2 in February. That may show that the biggest Chinese firms, and those under state control, are performing better. But economists had hoped to see a stronger reading, as the disruption caused by the Chinese new year fades away. IG's Evan Lucas explained: The March read was the first read free of the Chinese Luna New Year and despite the constant expansion there are weaknesses across the domestic sector, seeing price and output contracting. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It's a busy morning for economic data, with manufacturing surveys from countries across the globe being released in the next few hours. Fresh data from Europe will show how its economy is faring, after yesterday's weak inflation data prompted fears that it is sliding into deflation. Two surveys from China overnight have shown that its factory sector remained subdued in March (more to follow). In the eurozone, European finance ministers are gathering in Athens for a meeting that could give the green light to Greece's next tranche of bailout loans. And in the UK, we'll be watching the fallout from the official report into the privatisation of Royal Mail. Overnight, the National Audit Office hammered the handling of the sale; an extra \u00a3750m could have been raised for taxpayers if the government had heeded warnings that the company was being sold too cheaply. Royal Mail: undervaluing shares costs taxpayer \u00a3750m in one day I'll be tracking the main events through the day....",

      "body": "<p>Lord Mandelson has said Britain would be \"stark staring bonkers\" if it turned its back on the European Union.</p> <p>The former Labour minister said it made no sense to exit a market on Britain's doorstop and a move in that direction would erode the country's ability to trade with others.</p> <p>\"India would laugh in our faces\" if Britain tried to negotiate a free trade agreement outside Europe, he told delegates at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC)annual conference in London. \"They would walk away and leave us whistling in the wind.\"</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, told the conference earlier that to walk away from EU membership would be \"reckless, foolish and deeply damaging. It would be anti-investment, anti-jobs and anti-business.\"</p> <p>He said the Conservative pledge to hold a referendum on the subject was putting party politics before the national economic interest and creating huge uncertainty for business.</p> <p>\"There is no future for Britain in walking away from our biggest market,\" Balls said. \"We believe Britain is better placed to shape Europe's future, and back British business, jobs and our national interest, if we are fully engaged rather than having one foot out of the door.\"</p> <p>Mandelson made further remarks on the importance of taking the initiative on EU energy prices and suppliers.</p> <p>\"Why do we pay more than we should or need to for our energy supplies from outside Europe? The reason is that our suppliers \u2013 Russia and its gas supplier Gazprom in particular \u2013 play divide and rule among us.</p> <p>We're not united in Europe when it comes to energy. We need a single European energy market and we need a single purchasing agreement that enables us to turn the tables on our suppliers, assert our consumer and customer strength and stop these people calling the shots so that we can get our energy prices down.</p> <p>\"That is an illustration of where each and every business and consumer will be better off if we were able to use our vast market power against those who at the present time are playing divide and rule among us. It's an illustration of why our economic interests lie in Europe. You think we would have the strength, the power in a market on our own in Britain to stand up to the Gazproms and the Algerians and the others of this world and start dictating prices to them? No, you need market power in order to do that. That's what we get in Europe.\"</p> <p>The BCC's director general, John Longworth, said uncertainty over the EU, as well as over Scottish independence, was already hurting investment and holding back UK exports.</p> <p>He added that the government had so far failed in its bid to rebalance the economy and put the UK on a path to victory in the global race to achieve more exports.</p> <p>The chancellor George Osborne set a target in 2012 of doubling UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020. This would require a 10% increase in exports every year, according to Longworth.</p> <p>\"In 2012 as a nation we only managed 1.9% growth in goods exports, and only 0.6% in 2013. So far the national plan has failed,\" he said.</p> <p>Longworth also warned the UK's relationship with Scotland will be irrevocably changed whatever the outcome of the vote on independence.</p> <p>\"Scotland's choice is a very big deal. Will a yes vote be disruptive? You bet it will. Will a no vote still lead to a fundamental shift in the political and financial settlement? You bet it will.</p> <p>\"Regardless of how Scotland votes on 18 September, things will never be quite the same again.\"</p> <p>Longworth said Osborne had \"pulled off a brilliant Houdini-like trick\" by talking tough on deficit reduction without losing the confidence of global markets or triggering the social strife of the 1980s.</p> <p>He warned, however, that much of the pain was to come, with those departments whose spending was not ringfenced \u2013 including business, the home office, and welfare \u2013 facing further cuts of more than 30%.</p> <p>\"In our global race to create great, sustainable growth, Britain is barely off the starting blocks.

The former Labour minister said it made no sense to exit a market on Britain's doorstop and a move in that direction would erode the country's ability to trade with others. \"India would laugh in our faces\" if Britain tried to negotiate a free trade agreement outside Europe, he told delegates at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC)annual conference in London. \"They would walk away and leave us whistling in the wind.\" The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, told the conference earlier that to walk away from EU membership would be \"reckless, foolish and deeply damaging. It would be anti-investment, anti-jobs and anti-business.\" He said the Conservative pledge to hold a referendum on the subject was putting party politics before the national economic interest and creating huge uncertainty for business. \"There is no future for Britain in walking away from our biggest market,\" Balls said. \"We believe Britain is better placed to shape Europe's future, and back British business, jobs and our national interest, if we are fully engaged rather than having one foot out of the door.\" Mandelson made further remarks on the importance of taking the initiative on EU energy prices and suppliers. \"Why do we pay more than we should or need to for our energy supplies from outside Europe? The reason is that our suppliers \u2013 Russia and its gas supplier Gazprom in particular \u2013 play divide and rule among us. We're not united in Europe when it comes to energy. We need a single European energy market and we need a single purchasing agreement that enables us to turn the tables on our suppliers, assert our consumer and customer strength and stop these people calling the shots so that we can get our energy prices down. \"That is an illustration of where each and every business and consumer will be better off if we were able to use our vast market power against those who at the present time are playing divide and rule among us. It's an illustration of why our economic interests lie in Europe. You think we would have the strength, the power in a market on our own in Britain to stand up to the Gazproms and the Algerians and the others of this world and start dictating prices to them? No, you need market power in order to do that. That's what we get in Europe.\" The BCC's director general, John Longworth, said uncertainty over the EU, as well as over Scottish independence, was already hurting investment and holding back UK exports. He added that the government had so far failed in its bid to rebalance the economy and put the UK on a path to victory in the global race to achieve more exports. The chancellor George Osborne set a target in 2012 of doubling UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020. This would require a 10% increase in exports every year, according to Longworth. \"In 2012 as a nation we only managed 1.9% growth in goods exports, and only 0.6% in 2013. So far the national plan has failed,\" he said. Longworth also warned the UK's relationship with Scotland will be irrevocably changed whatever the outcome of the vote on independence. \"Scotland's choice is a very big deal. Will a yes vote be disruptive? You bet it will. Will a no vote still lead to a fundamental shift in the political and financial settlement? You bet it will. \"Regardless of how Scotland votes on 18 September, things will never be quite the same again.\" Longworth said Osborne had \"pulled off a brilliant Houdini-like trick\" by talking tough on deficit reduction without losing the confidence of global markets or triggering the social strife of the 1980s. He warned, however, that much of the pain was to come, with those departments whose spending was not ringfenced \u2013 including business, the home office, and welfare \u2013 facing further cuts of more than 30%. \"In our global race to create great, sustainable growth, Britain is barely off the starting blocks. Gross domestic product is not yet back to pre-recession levels and we lag behind competitor countries.\"",

      "bodyText": "The business secretary, Vince Cable, has refused to apologise over the government's privatisation of Royal Mail, despite a scathing report from the National Audit Office, which said undervaluing the share sale had cost the taxpayer \u00a3750m in a single day. In a lively debate in the House of Commons, Cable defended the controversial float last October, after coming under fire from the shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, and other MPs. \"The last thing I intend to do is apologise,\" Cable said. He insisted that the privatisation had been a success and that there had been a real risk that the flotation could have failed if the shares had been priced higher. \"We've taken a loss-making public enterprise and turned it into a successful public company,\" he added. He accused Labour itself of selling state assets off on the cheap. Umunna, who demanded an apology from Cable, hit back by saying taxpayers had been \"disgracefully shortchanged to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds\". He added: \"Those [Cable] once referred to as spivs and gamblers are laughing all the way to the bank.\" Royal Mail shares have soared more than 70%, trading at 565.5p on Tuesday, since their stock market debut at 330p a share in October. Cable said there was still a \"great deal of froth\" around the share price. The audit office criticised the government's \"deep caution\" and accused the government of ignoring repeated warnings from City analysts that its plan to float Royal Mail at a maximum price of 330p a share vastly undervalued the company. The audit office said the government had ploughed ahead with its plans because it was worried that increasing the flotation price from the 260p-330p range could put off institutional investors and jeopardise the float as postal workers were gearing up for a nationwide strike. Earlier on Tuesday, business minister Michael Fallon said it was \"right to be cautious\". Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, he said: \"We could have got a higher price but we would have taken a bigger risk of people not subscribing to the shares and the Royal Mail share sale collapsing.\" Independent analyst Louise Cooper judged the government as \"naive at best, incompetent at worst\". She tweeted during the Commons debate: \"It was Vince Cable's responsibility to make the pricing decision on Royal Mail and he called it very wrong.\" In a note, she said: \"It is a story of how conflicts of interest can be so damaging. First to blame, according to the NAO, are the politicians who were in so much of a hurry to sell Royal Mail that it was done too cheaply \u2026 Seventeen key investors were sought for their comments up to a year ahead of the initial public offering \"These key investors who caused the deal to be struck too cheaply, then were rewarded by better allocations than other investors (which essentially means a larger cheque) but sold half their stock within weeks! It couldn't get worse. Mr Cable you were had.\" Royal Mail's shares spiked 38% on their stock market debut on 11 October \u2013 the biggest one-day rise in a privatisation since British Airways in 1987 \u2013 as investors tried to snap up more than 23 times the number of shares available. The audit office said the government could have made an additional \u00a3750m for taxpayers if it had priced the sale at the first day closing price of 455p rather than the maximum 330p starting price. Achieving an additional \u00a3750m from the sale could have covered the annual salaries of 34,000 NHS nurses. Amyas Morse, head of the audit office, said: \"The department was very keen to achieve its objective of selling Royal Mail, and was successful in getting the company listed on the FTSE 100. Its approach, however, was marked by deep caution, the price of which was borne by the taxpayer.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain's productivity has improved but still remains well below its pre-recession level, according to figures that have sparked fresh warnings that the UK must invest in skills to secure the recovery. The Office for National Statistics said UK labour productivity, measured on an output-per-hour basis, rose 0.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. That made up for a drop of 0.2% in the previous quarter but it was not enough to claw back deep losses during the downturn. For 2013 as a whole, productivity remained more than three percentage points below the 2008 level. Geraint Johnes, director at The Work Foundation, said the latest pickup in activity was welcome following the \"dismal performance\" over the last few years. \"Nevertheless, this rate of growth remains below half of the long-run trend \u2026 Stronger overall productivity growth will require renewed investment in the skills of the British workforce, making up ground lost during the years since recession,\" he added. On a year earlier, productivity growth was 0.7%, an improvement on the 0.1% annual fall in the third quarter, the ONS said. The figures showed a contrast between productivity in the UK's dominant services sector and the smaller industrial sector, which includes manufacturing. In the service sector, labour productivity has been broadly flat since 2010, the ONS said. In the final quarter of last year there was little improvement, with growth of just 0.3% from the previous quarter and 0.7% from a year earlier. For manufacturing \u2013 10% of the economy \u2013 output per hour rose 1.4% in the fourth quarter, the fastest growth for two and a half years. Across the production industries taken together productivity growth was a softer 1.2% as manufacturing strength was offset by steep falls in the non-manufacturing components of production, especially the oil and gas industry. John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist consultancy, said productivity had yet to respond markedly to the economic recovery. \"There are signs of life in the latest labour productivity figures but nothing that could yet be described as a bounce,\" he said. The government has been hoping for a pickup in productivity to help secure the recovery and give employers more capacity to raise wages after years of earnings falling in real terms. For policymakers at the Bank of England the lack of growth in productivity has posed something of a puzzle and they have had to scale back their forecasts for it to pick up pace this year. The ONS said a drop in productivity for six consecutive quarters between 2011 and 2012, reflected a combination of \"resilience in the labour market and sluggish output growth\". \"Since the start of 2013 the average pace of output growth has accelerated while the average growth of hours worked has slowed a little, allowing a slow expansion of output per hour,\" it added.",

      "bodyText": "Major investors could face huge losses if they continue to be complacent about the impact of rising interest rates on their riskier trades, the Bank of England's financial policy committee has warned. The committee said in minutes of its latest meeting that many investors appeared to be overly relaxed at the prospect of rate rises, which could undermine investment policies devised in an era of cheap money. The committee, which has responsiblity for monitoring the risks taken by the banking and insurance sectors, said that while borrowing remained low by historical standands, investors were shifting money around the world to take advantage of interest rates in complex trading patterns that could backfire. The minutes said: \"Nonetheless, members were concerned that there was a risk that this apparent resilience to past developments in advanced economy monetary policy could reinforce risk appetite in a way that did not fully take account of the eventual transition of monetary policy to more normal settings.\" The committee, which has previously warned of the potential impact of interest rates rising from their record lows, said the transition to higher rates could pose challenges in some sectors of financial markets. It said changes to the way banks are structured since the crisis made it more difficult to spot patterns of behaviour and judge what the impact of any surprises would be. Recent analysis by the ratings agency Moody's found that UK households would be resilient in the face of an interest rate rise, despite many homebuyers facing financial hardship in recent yerars. Base rates are expected to start rising next year from the current 0.5% to around 1.5% a year later. The US Federal Reserve has also signalled that rates are likey to start rising in 2015, although, like the UK, they are expected to move up gently over a period of several years. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and chair of the FPC, has already indicated that rates are likely to peak at 3% and could have only a marginal impact on households as banks squeeze the profit margins on mortgage products to maintain market share. The financial commitee reiterated it would \"remain vigilant to emerging vulnerabilities\" related to the recovery in Britain's housing market and would \"take further proportionate and graduated action if warranted\". It has asked the Financial Conduct Authority to assess how borrowers and financial institutions will cope with a sharp upward movement in long-term interest rates and credit spreads. \"The work had suggested that the UK banking sector would be resilient to direct losses caused by the impact of moderate increases in long-term interest rates. But there was significant uncertainty around potential amplification effects operating through the wider financial system,\" it said The minutes said the Bank of England would hold consultations during the second quarter of 2014 on how to revive the securitisation market, which came to prominence in the run-up to the financial crisis. Bank officials have previously said securitisation, which lenders used to bundle up packages of mortgages and sell them on, can be an important way for the UK's corporate sector to raise funds for investment.",

    "webTitle": "Undervaluing Royal Mail shares cost taxpayers \u00a3750m in one day", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government's desperation to sell Royal Mail cost taxpayers \u00a3750m in a single day, the National Audit Office has said in a scathing report into the privatisation of the 500-year-old national institution. The public spending watchdog says the business secretary Vince Cable ploughed ahead with plans to float Royal Mail at a maximum price of 330p-a-share despite repeated warnings from City experts that the government had vastly undervalued the company. The audit office said in a report today that Cable chose not to heed the warnings and increase the flotation price from the 260-330p range because of fears it could put off institutional investors and jeopardise the flotation as postal workers were preparing for nationwide strike action. The watchdog said the business department's keen desire to achieve a successful sale of Royal Mail within this parliament \"resulted in the shares being priced at a level substantially below that at which they started trading\". Royal Mail's shares spiked 38% on their debut on the stock market on 11 October - the biggest one-day rise in a privatisation since British Airways in 1987 - as investors tried to buy up more than 23 times the number of shares available. The audit office said the government could have made an additional \u00a3750m for taxpayers if it had priced the sale at the first day closing price of 455p rather than the maximum 330p starting price. Achieving an additional \u00a3750m from the sale could have covered the annual salaries of an additional 34,000 NHS nurses. The early jump in the share price, dismissed by Cable as \"froth and speculation\" was followed by a continued rise to a peak of 618p in January. The shares closed at 563p yesterday, still 70% higher than the float price. Amyas Morse, head of the audit office, said: \"The department was very keen to achieve its objective of selling Royal Mail, and was successful in getting the company listed on the FTSE 100. Its approach, however, was marked by deep caution, the price of which was borne by the taxpayer.\" Cable said: \"Achieving the highest price possible at any cost and whatever the risk was never the aim of the sale. The report concludes there was a real risk of a failed sale attached to pushing the price too high. And a failed sale would have been the worst outcome for taxpayers and jeopardised the operation of Royal Mail.\" The audit office said the government's pricing decision was largely influenced by Cable's desire for \"long-term, blue chip\" institutional investors to buy and hold large chunks of Royal Mail shares. Despite overwhelming public demand for the shares (the public ordered enough to own the whole of the postal service but were cut down to just \u00a3750 per person), Cable allowed 16 long-term investors, mostly pension funds, priority access to the shares. The audit office said this was part of the government's \"expectation that they would form part of a stable long-term and supportive shareholder base\". At the time, Cable said: \"We wanted to make sure that the company started its new life with a core of high quality investors who would be there in good times and bad, interested in Royal Mail and the universal service it provides for consumers over the long term.\" However, the audit office said six of the 16 \"priority investors\" selected by Cable had sold all of their allocation within weeks of the float, at a substantial profit. The watchdog said that by the end of January 2014 just 12% of the company's shares were held by the \"priority investors\". A large proportion of their shares were gobbled up by hedge funds, which Cable has repeatedly attacked for being short term investors, describing them as \"spivs and gamblers\". Within a fortnight of the float, a London hedge fund whose boss was memorably described as a \"locust\" by German politicians, bought up so many shares that it became Royal Mail's second-biggest investor after the government, which retained a 30% stake. The Children's Investment Fund, which is run by billionaire Chris Hohn, bought up 5.8% of the shares. It has since cut its stake down below 5%. The audit office also criticised the government for relying too heavily on its advisers, predominately the investment bank Lazard. The watchdog said the government gave Lazard an incentive \"solely to complete a transaction\" \u2013 not to achieve the maximum value for taxpayers. \"The taxpayer interest was not clearly prioritised within the structure of the independent adviser's role,\" the audit office said in its report. And it revealed that the government asked its advisers if it should increase the offer price in the days before the float. The department's banking advisers said the top of the price range could be increased by 20p to 350p - which would have made an extra \u00a3120m for taxpayers. However, Lazards and the banks advised against increasing the price for fear it could have put off investors. This was despite some of the banking syndicate's analysts valuing the shares as high as 510p, with no one reckoning they were worth less than 300p. Lazards advised selling the shares at between 212-262p. Lazard was paid \u00a31.5m for its advice. The government spent a total of \u00a312.7m on fees to bankers, including UBS, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Merrill Lynch, accountants, lawyers and PR advisers. Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, said the department for business made a \"critical error by incentivising its private advisers to sell the shares on time at the expense of price\". She said the 70% rise in Royal Mail's share price since flotation shows that the department \"had no clue what it was doing\". Hodge said she was looking forward to \"discussing this second class performance\" when the department gives evidence to the committee in May. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the audit office's report was a \"damning verdict on the Tory-led government's botched Royal Mail fire sale, leaving the taxpayer disgracefully short changed by hundreds of millions of pounds\". Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union that represents postmen and women, said the report \"finds the government guilty\"of overseeing a \"get rich quick\" scheme which offered no value to taxpayers. Unite national officer Brian Scott said: \"This report is startling proof that the government sold off the country's family silver on the cheap.\"",

And a failed sale would have been the worst outcome for taxpayers and jeopardised the operation of Royal Mail.\"</p> <p>The audit office said the government's pricing decision was largely influenced by Cable's desire for \"long-term, blue chip\" institutional investors to buy and hold large chunks of Royal Mail shares.</p> <p>Despite overwhelming public demand for the shares (the public ordered enough to own the whole of the postal service but were cut down to just \u00a3750 per person), Cable allowed 16 long-term investors, mostly pension funds, priority access to the shares.</p> <p>The audit office said this was part of the government's \"expectation that they would form part of a stable long-term and supportive shareholder base\".</p> <p>At the time, Cable said: \"We wanted to make sure that the company started its new life with a core of high quality investors who would be there in good times and bad, interested in Royal Mail and the universal service it provides for consumers over the long term.\"</p> <p>However, the audit office said six of the 16 \"priority investors\" selected by Cable had sold all of their allocation within weeks of the float, at a substantial profit.</p> <p>The watchdog said that by the end of January 2014 just 12% of the company's shares were held by the \"priority investors\".</p> <p>A large proportion of their shares were gobbled up by hedge funds, which Cable has repeatedly attacked for being short term investors, describing them as \"spivs and gamblers\".</p> <p>Within a fortnight of the float, a London hedge fund whose boss was memorably described as a \"locust\" by German politicians, bought up so many shares that it became Royal Mail's second-biggest investor after the government, which retained a 30% stake.</p> <p>The Children's Investment Fund, which is run by billionaire Chris Hohn, bought up 5.8% of the shares. It has since cut its stake down below 5%.</p> <p>The audit office also criticised the government for relying too heavily on its advisers, predominately the investment bank Lazard. The watchdog said the government gave Lazard an incentive \"solely to complete a transaction\" \u2013 not to achieve the maximum value for taxpayers. \"The taxpayer interest was not clearly prioritised within the structure of the independent adviser's role,\" the audit office said in its report. And it revealed that the government asked its advisers if it should increase the offer price in the days before the float.</p> <p>The department's banking advisers said the top of the price range could be increased by 20p to 350p - which would have made an extra \u00a3120m for taxpayers. However, Lazards and the banks advised against increasing the price for fear it could have put off investors. This was despite some of the banking syndicate's analysts valuing the shares as high as 510p, with no one reckoning they were worth less than 300p. Lazards advised selling the shares at between 212-262p.</p> <p>Lazard was paid \u00a31.5m for its advice. The government spent a total of \u00a312.7m on fees to bankers, including UBS, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Merrill Lynch, accountants, lawyers and PR advisers.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, said the department for business made a \"critical error by incentivising its private advisers to sell the shares on time at the expense of price\".</p> <p>She said the 70% rise in Royal Mail's share price since flotation shows that the department \"had no clue what it was doing\". Hodge said she was looking forward to \"discussing this second class performance\" when the department gives evidence to the committee in May.</p> <p>Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the audit office's report was a \"damning verdict on the Tory-led government's botched Royal Mail fire sale, leaving the taxpayer disgracefully short changed by hundreds of millions of pounds\".</p> <p>Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union that represents postmen and women, said the report \"finds the government guilty\"of overseeing a \"get rich quick\" scheme which offered no value to taxpayers.</p> <p>Unite national officer Brian Scott said: \"This report is startling proof that the government sold off the country's family silver on the cheap.\"</p>",
