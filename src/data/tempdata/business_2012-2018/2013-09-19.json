    "webTitle": "Whale of a fine: after blowing $6bn, JP Morgan's trader costs another $920m", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last spring the City of London was rife with rumours about a trader at the vast JP Morgan investment bank who was making such huge bets on the highly complex \u2013 and deeply risky \u2013 derivatives markets that he was known as \"the London Whale\" or \"Voldemort\". After racking up losses of $6bn (\u00a33.7bn) from his reckless trading, the London Whale blew another hole in the bank on Thursday \u2013 landing the Wall Street firm with one of the largest fines ever levied against a single bank. The Whale was a French-born trader, Bruno Iksil. When stories of his dangerous dealings and the scale of the potential black hole first surfaced, JP Morgan's chairman Jamie Dimon, then Wall Street's most respected banker, shrugged off the losses off with a phrase that will haunt his career: \"It's a complete tempest in a teapot,\" he insisted. On Thursday, however, the bank agreed to pay some $920m in penalties to US and UK regulators over the \"unsafe and unsound practices\" that had allowed the bank's losses to balloon to $6.2bn. The near record fine comes as former JP Morgan bankers face criminal action in the US and it has all but sunk Dimon's once promising political career. It is also just one of a series of costly and damaging scandals that are rocking the financial institution. The US's biggest bank must now hand over $300m to the US office of the comptroller of the currency, $200m to the Federal Reserve, $200m to the securities and exchange commission (SEC) and \u00a3137.6m to the UK's City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). One other US regulator, the commodity futures trading commission, did not sign off on the fine and is still investigating whether the bank is guilty of market manipulation. JP Morgan admitted wrongdoing as part of the settlement \u2013 an unusual step for a financial firm in the crosshairs of multiple legal actions. This week, in a letter to staff, Dimon warned them that, even after the fine, there was \"more to come\". The opinions of the regulators were uniformly damning. \"JP Morgan failed to keep watch over its traders as they overvalued a very complex portfolio to hide massive losses,\" co-director of the SEC's division of enforcement, George Canellos, said. Senior management \"broke a cardinal rule \u2026 and deprived its board of critical information,\" he said. The bank was accused of \"unsafe and unsound practices\". The FCA, levying its largest fine to date, said: \"The firm's failings were extremely serious. The losses were caused by a high-risk trading strategy, weak management of that trading and an inadequate response to important information which should have notified the firm of the huge risks present.\" The Whale's losses are not JP Morgan's only problem. The bank emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crisis, leaving Dimon as the only untarnished king of Wall Street, but the recovery has been less kind. JP Morgan has already faced vast fines for what became known as robosigning \u2013 automated procedures which forced thousands of US homeowners out of their houses without following the correct procedures. On Thursday the bank also agreed to pay $389m to settle allegations that its credit card customers were duped into purchasing services they did not want. At least eight federal agencies are investigating the bank on issues ranging from its mortgage lending practices to its role in fraudster Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Regulators are reported to be pressing for a $6bn penalty to settle allegations that the bank mis-sold $33bn of bonds backed by sub-prime mortgages to US government-controlled mortgage companies in the run-up to the financial crisis. In an indictment unsealed in federal court this week Javier Martin-Artajo, who oversaw trading strategy at the bank's London office, and Julien Grout, a trader who worked for him, were charged with securities fraud, conspiracy, filing false books and records, wire fraud and making false filings to the SEC. Dimon has learned from his \"teapot\" comment and is now expressing contrition for the bank's debacle. \"We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them,\" he said. This year the bank has hired 3,000 staff to work on \"compliance\" \u2013 or working within the rules. But reaction to the fine was mixed. John Coffee, professor at Columbia Law School, said: \"The victims of this enormous loss were the shareholders of JP Morgan and the remedy is for those shareholders to pay $900m plus in fines. It's not just adding insult to injury, it's adding injury to injury.\" No senior bank official has been charged with wrongdoing and Coffee described those indicted so far as \"relatively small fish\". He added: \"Ideally the regulators should fine actual individuals who are responsible. But time and again the SEC settles for large penalties and gives virtual immunity to some officers.\" Record fines $25bn Five banks \u2013 Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Ally Financial \u2013 hit in 2012 with bill totalling \u00a315.6bn for abusing the procedures to repossess homes. $9.3bn 13 Banks, including JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, ordered this year to pay equivalent in cash and other help to homeowners for abusing procedures to repossess their homes. $1.9bn HSBC's 2012 fine for failing to prevent money laundering on a massive scale. $1.5bn UBS (Switzerland) was fined this much last year for manipulating Libor, the interbank lending rate. $1.4bn 10 banks, including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, hit in 2003 with fines for serious conflicts of interest between their research for investors and their investment banking businesses.",

      "bodyText": "Global markets moved sharply higher today in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's surprise decision not to scale back its $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme. But shares came off their best levels as concerns about the state of the US economy re-emerged in the wake of the Fed's decision to keep pumping money into the financial system. The US central bank's chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday night that the country's economy was too fragile to begin \"tapering\" \u2013 or cutting back \u2013 its massive bond-buying programme. Most economists were caught on the hop by the decision. They had been predicting Bernanke would authorise a cut of up to $10bn a month, ever since the Fed chairman hinted in May that the wall of money which has been supporting global markets for several months could start being wound down by the end of the year. In June Bernanke repeated the suggestion that the bond purchases would be gradually reduced and ended completely by the middle of 2014, when the unemployment rate was expected to reach 7%, from the current 7.3%. Bernanke's comments in May sent shares sharply lower and began a period of volatility in global markets, not helped by the recent crisis in Syria. The prospect of tapering also sent bond yields and long-term interest rates higher, putting further pressure on the fragile US recovery and partly prompting Wednesday's decision by the Fed to delay its move. Analysts pointed out that Bernanke would also have paid attention to the prospect of a US government shutdown on 1 October unless Democrats and Republicans in Congress can reach a compromise on the federal budget. As a result, many believe the Fed will now wait until its December meeting to begin reducing its stimulus measures, depending on the strength of forthcoming economic data. Today the picture was muddied further by strong US housing figures, with existing home sales up 1.7% last month, as well as factory output in the mid-west growing at its strongest level for more than two years. But US weekly jobless claims rose to 309,000 last week from a seven-year low of 294,000 in the previous week. Bernanke himself is also part of the uncertainty, since he will not serve a third term and is likely to hand over to his successor before the stimulus measures have run their course. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \"Looking at some of the commentary in the last 24 hours the argument has been that the Fed 'bottled' a decision on tapering last night, with many saying that the Fed has a significant communication problem. There is no question that last night's decision could well have been managed better, but at no point did the Fed indicate that they would pull the trigger on any tapering program in September. \"The market saw what it wanted to see and ignored all the clues to the contrary, including Bernanke's comments in July about his concerns about the unemployment rate understating the problems in the US jobs market.\" Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart, said Bernanke had merely added to the current uncertainty by catching the markets by surprise: \"Maybe he really is worried about the US economy in ways others have not thought about. More than ever each set of data will henceforth spark speculation as to what the [Fed] might make of it. The US practice of publishing often wildly fluctuating monthly data will add to market volatility.\" That volatility was in evidence today. The initial euphoria after the Fed decision sent the FTSE 100 more than 100 points higher, but as uncertainty set in, the index lost some of its early gains to close at 6625.39, up 66.57 points, or just over 1%. It was a similar pattern elsewhere, with Germany's Dax up 107 points initially, before finishing 48.79 points higher at 8684.85, still a new closing high. France's Cac closed 0.71% better at 4200, having reached 4227. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei just closed at an eight-week high, having surged 1.8%, and emerging markets also benefited from the prospect of increased liquidity from the Fed, with India's Sensex up 3.4% and the Turkish market jumping more than 6%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high immediately following the Fed announcement, but edged lower in early trading today, down 31 points by lunchtime. The dollar weakened against other major currencies with the pound holding steady at a nine-month high above $1.60, while the euro hit a seven-and-a-half-year high of $1.3568. Commodities also climbed sharply, with gold hitting a one-week high and copper reaching its best level for three weeks. Mining shares were among the leading gainers in London after the rise in commodity prices, with Randgold Resources jumping 8% and Anglo American adding nearly 4%. But oil lost its early Bernanke boost, with Brent crude losing 1.5% to $108.9 a barrel after Iran's new president made conciliatory noises towards the west, prompting talk of increased supplies from the region.",

But it then questions whether JPM got a lower fine in return:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Why does such egregious conduct merit a fine of only $200 million? To put that in context, it\u2019s less than half the $550 million Goldman Sachs Group Inc. paid in 2010 to settle allegations it misled investors in a mortgage bond deal, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. It\u2019s also less than the $300 million the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency collected from J.P. Morgan on the \u2018Whale\u2019 case.</p> <p>Mr. Canellos said the $200 million penalty is \u201cunprecedented for an internal controls case\u201d and one of the largest in the SEC\u2019s history.</p> <p>But some officials inside the SEC have already privately expressed concerns about whether the agency will have to accept lower financial sanctions as the price of gaining an admission of wrongdoing. The J.P.Morgan deal could start that debate in earnest.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's a good debate to have.

It was in this climate that the funeral of Pavlos Fyssas took place this morning with mourners chanting incendiary slogans such as \u201cwhen blood flows, it demands revenge\u201d and \u201cthe people don\u2019t forget. Death to fascism.\u201d</p> <p>&#xa0;Indicative of the mood, the hip-hop artist\u2019s father told one TV station that he wanted the murderer \u201cnot to be tried and imprisoned but executed.

The taper was supposed to be a demonstration of strength; that after five years of ultra-stimulative monetary policy the time was coming closer when the economy would be able to stand on its own feet. By definition, therefore, the no-taper decision is an admission of weakness.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/2013/09/18/never-underestimate-the-feds-dovishness/\">Gavyn Davies in the FT:&#xa0;Never underestimate the Fed\u2019s dovishness</a></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have to conclude that the FOMC is more reluctant to taper than the market had come to believe, and that their decisions will be data dependent, with no firm eye on the calendar guidance they previously offered.</p> <p>We should also conclude that the danger that QE will cause an excessive amount of risk taking in parts of the financial system is not, in their minds, a sufficient condition to slow the growth in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. A journalist asked Mr Bernanke in the press conference whether he would ever see any clear grounds for stepping away from QE, and he answered rather hesitantly that this required a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labour market. There was no hint that fears of a financial bubble would induce him to act any sooner than that criterion implied.</p> <p>The bottom line is that the period in which the markets can expect the Fed to be aggressively easy has once more been lengthened as a result of this decision. Yet again, we discover that it is dangerous to bet against the innate dovishness of the Fed and its current chairman.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/10319186/Fed-recoils-from-1937-tightening-error-as-jobs-evaporate.html\">Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in the Telegraph:&#xa0;Fed recoils from 1937 tightening error as jobs evaporate</a></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be a grave error for the Fed to taper bond purchases at all at this juncture, given the risks for Brazil, India, Turkey, South Africa, Indonesia, Ukraine and others already facing a turn in the credit cycle, and given the danger of another eurozone debt spasm, as happened at the end of QE1 and the end of QE2.</p> <p>The Bernanke Fed has twice misjudged the global effects of premature tightening already, each time precipitating a credit and stock market crash within weeks, and each time forcing the Fed to capitulate. Third time lucky?</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/article/1379554198/sorry-investors-ben-bernanke-has-got-it-totally-wrong\">Allister Heath in City AM:&#xa0;Sorry, investors, but Ben Bernanke has got it totally wrong</a></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most central bankers are making a fatal error: the belief that the micro-management of aggregate demand is the answer to all of our problems. It isn\u2019t. Of course, the Fed was right to act when the economy began to implode: one (but not the only one) of the great lessons of the 1930s depression, as expounded by Milton Friedman and Anna J Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States is that the money supply should never be allowed to collapse. But to agree to that proposition is very different from thinking that policy should respond to every blip in data, every worry about construction output. For all the talk of rules, the status quo is about extreme discretion.</p> <p>At issue is a classic confusion. Monetary stimulus can help economic activity in the short-term \u2013 but not in the long-term, when what economists call real factors such as productivity growth determine output, jobs and wages. The US economy is suffering from a real, supply-side crisis, with wages under pressure and fewer people finding work. No amount of QE will solve this. Ben Bernanke is tilting at windmills. It will all end in tears.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-523aa96be4b04c15d3d3156a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-19T07:45:11.768Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Brenda Kell</strong>y of <strong>IG</strong> flags up that nearly every share on the entire London stock market is up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BrendaKelly_IG/statuses/380592529072091136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FuturesTechs\">@FuturesTechs</a> the FTSE this morning is hilarious.

      "bodyText": "The London Whale fine is going to reverberate around the financial world for a while, with JP Morgan shares now down 1.4% on the day to $52.60. Right now, though, Wall Street appears to be more agitated about yesterday's big news -- that the Federal Reserve was not prepared to slow down its huge money-printing stimulus programme yet. The Dow Jones index, which soared to record highs yesterday, is losing ground today. Currently down 35 points at 15,641, with traders fretting about the state of the US economy, and wondering when the Fed might start to \"taper\" its QE programme (see my opening post for the backstory). Here's Capital Economics' latest prediction: The Fed is still likely to reduce its monthly bond purchases in the coming months \u2013 we suspect this will now happen in December. That said, it now looks as if it may proceed more cautiously than we had assumed. Clearly the Fed has been spooked by the extent of the surge in long-term interest rates over the past couple of months and the impact that now appears to be having on the housing market. We could be in for an edgy autumn.... Earlier, European markets closed higher - but off their earlier peaks. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 66 points at 6625, +1% \u2022 German DAX: up 58 points at 8694, + 0.67% \u2022 French CAC: up 35 points at 4206 And with that, we're finishing up here in London. Thanks all. GW Thanks for all the comments (as ever!). Here's a few on the JP Morgan Whale fine: Some reaction to that latest fine: Is it \"Fine JP Morgan Day\"? The bank has just agreed a settlement with US regulators over charges brought against its credit card division, relating to the sale of payment protection insurance. This means JPM will pay fines of around $80m. The deal will also see $309m returned to customers, although there were reports this week that the refunds have already been paid. Reuters has the details: U.S. regulators on Thursday ordered JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co JPM.N to refund about $309 million to credit-card customers who were billed for identity-theft protection services that they did not receive. JPMorgan, which was fined $920 million by regulators earlier on Thursday over separate trading issues, also must pay a $20 million penalty to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and $60 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Today's settlement is also an early success for Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, which has replaced the Financial Services Authority (FSA) -- the regulator in charge while the Whale's risky trades were blowing up. Mary Stevens, manager for regulatory analysis in Europe at Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, reckons the FCA is going to be toothier watchdog than its predecessor (lampooned as the Fundamentally Supine Authority by wicked satirists). Stevens says: If we wind the clock back five years or so, it is clear that the previous Regulator, the FSA, struggled with multi-tasking. With the FCA, the days of reviews coming one at a time within specific sectors are gone. Led by newly published FCA thematic reviews we now see that every sector of the UK Financial Services markets is under fire. Such reviews are clearly showing the direction the FCA particularly is taking, many of which are driven by Europe. In its first six months of being, it is clear that the FCA is living up to its billing of being much more active and interventionist and today\u2019s action is certainly the clearest indicator so far of this new hard-line approach to regulatory enforcement. If institutions had any question marks as to what kind of regulator the FCA would be, today\u2019s announcement will go a long way to answering them. JP Morgan shares have been pushed back down as Wall Street traders digest today's fines. They're back down around 1% lower, at $52.8. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital in the City, says the damage to JP Morgan's good name is probably costlier than the actual $920m penalty. The bigger damage is of course is the reputational damage to JPM and another blow to London, a city embroiled with banking scandal after scandal. Trust in the banking system remains low and fragile given these scandals and the large bonuses paid out to management. Although a caveat worth pointing out is that London is a global financial hub, pioneering innovative structured products which is a reflection of the attractive and compelling business environment the city presents across the world. That said, it is these complex innovative products that got JPM into this mess in the first place \u2013 clearly, management at JPM had no idea about risk controls to mitigate untoward losses racked up by this particular unit at JPM. The JP Morgan settlement looks like a big coup for the SEC's newish chair, Mary Jo White. White, who took over in April, pledged in June to end the practice of Wall Street firms settling cases while neither admitting nor denying any actual wrongdoing. The days of such copouts may indeed be over, as JP Morgan has accepted the findings of the SEC's probe. The Wall Street Journal's Moneybeat blog calls it an 'historic moment'. But it then questions whether JPM got a lower fine in return: Why does such egregious conduct merit a fine of only $200 million? To put that in context, it\u2019s less than half the $550 million Goldman Sachs Group Inc. paid in 2010 to settle allegations it misled investors in a mortgage bond deal, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. It\u2019s also less than the $300 million the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency collected from J.P. Morgan on the \u2018Whale\u2019 case. Mr. Canellos said the $200 million penalty is \u201cunprecedented for an internal controls case\u201d and one of the largest in the SEC\u2019s history. But some officials inside the SEC have already privately expressed concerns about whether the agency will have to accept lower financial sanctions as the price of gaining an admission of wrongdoing. The J.P.Morgan deal could start that debate in earnest. It's a good debate to have. However, the Abacus case was arguably more serious than the Whale -- Goldman was accused of deliberately putting bad loans into a securitised debt obligation which it sold to its clients. Emails from the trader at the heart of the scheme which talked about how \"the entire system is about to crumble any moment\" didn't help its case. Robert Peston of the BBC has put his finger on one reason for the fiasco -- the lines of regulatory responsibility were blurred, because JP Morgan's London operations were under the control of its US-based Chief Investment Office (run by Ina Drew, who resigned a year ago). This created the oversight gap which the London Whale squeezed through. Hardly an excuse, of course. It's also a reminder that so many financial scandals have begun in the London-based branches of US banks (see also the Goldman Sachs Abacus affair, and the derivative losses that almost sunk insurance giant AIG). But the bottom line remains: 1) How and why the reputation and good name that JP Morgan boasted for generations was no guarantee of either competence or honesty 2) The lamentable transatlantic arrangements for regulating and supervising a bank of critical importance to the functioning of global markets and the economy. More from Peston here. The FCA's Tracey McDermott has been arguing that the Whale case shows the City still needs to clean up its act: A $920m fine sounds quite chunky, but JP Morgan should be able to pay it off easily. The bank reported net profits of $6.5bn for the second quarter of the financial year. That was a 31% jump on the previous year -- when its earnings were hit by the cost of unwinding the Whale's toxic derivative contracts. The Financial Times points out that CEO Jamie Dimon and colleagues have avoided \"specific criticism\" in today's financial penalties. The FT also reminds us that the Whale scandal is still being investigated by America's Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the US attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, nearly 18 months after Dimon memorably described the London losses as a \"tempest in a teacup\". JP Morgan shares did fall 1% in early trading, but are now down barely 0.2% at $53.20. With the Whale of a fine (sorry) now agreed, Wall Street firm S&amp;P Capital IQ has just hiked its rating on JP Morgan to a \"strong buy\". It has raised its share price target to $61 from $59, predicting that the Bank will profit as it get to grips with its regulatory actions Erik Oja, equity analyst at S&amp;P Capital IQ, said: We think J. P. Morgan does quite well, looking at net interest margin, revenue growth and trading income. Via Marketwatch. JP Morgan does appear to have grasped that its compliance operations weren't up to the job. It has hired an extra 3,000 people so far this year to keep a closer watch on its own operations, as well as pulling out of some riskier areas of finance (such as student loans). More here: JP Morgan Chase hires 3,000 new staff in its compliance department JP Morgan's senior management also broke one of the \"cardinal rules\" of Wall Street, according to the SEC's George Canellos. They failed to keep their own board of directors informed about the calamity that was unfolding in the City as the derivative bets taken out by Bruno Iksil's team blew up in the bank's face. Canellos explains: In addition to failing to keep watch over how the traders valued a very complex portfolio, JPMorgan\u2019s senior management broke a cardinal rule of corporate governance: inform your board of directors of matters that call into question the truth of what the company is disclosing to investors. Here, at the very moment JPMorgan\u2019s management was grappling with how to fix its internal control breakdowns and disclose the full scope of its CIO trading disaster, the bank\u2019s Audit Committee was in the dark about the extent of these problems. The SEC is no more impressed with JP Morgan than the City's FCA (see here). Canellos speaks of the bank's \"egregious breakdowns in controls and governance\", which threatened its millions of shareholders at risk and resulted in inaccurate public filings. The $200m fine imposed by the SEC is \"unprecedented\" for a case of internal control failure, Canellos added, as well as being \"one of the largest penalties in the history of the SEC\". Here's the SEC's full statement. Today's fines are not the end of the story. They just underline what a serious mess JP Morgan got into with the London Whale. As our Wall Street correspondent, Dominic Rushe, writes: The Justice Department is pursuing criminal charges against some of the bankers responsible for the massive loss. In an indictment unsealed in federal court this week Javier Martin-Artajo, who oversaw trading strategy at the bank's London office, and Julien Grout, a trader who worked for him, were charged with securities fraud, conspiracy, filing false books and records, wire fraud and making false filings to the SEC. Grout's lawyer said this week that his client was being \"unjustly played as a pawn in the government's attempt to settle its highly politicized case against JP Morgan Chase\". Here's Dom's news story on today's fine Sky News's Joel Hills sums up the \u00a3137m fine levied on JP Morgan by the City watchdog in one pithy tweet: JP Morgan has released its own statement on the $920m fine imposed today (see this post onwards) over the London Whale debacle. Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive officer, began with a note of contrition.... We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them. We will continue to strive towards being considered the best bank - across all measures - not only by our shareholders and customers, but also by our regulators. Since these losses occurred, we have made numerous changes that have made us a stronger, smarter, better Company. Modestly put.... Lee R. Raymond, the lead director of JPM's board of directors, also said the bank has learned from its mistakes. Another Whale will not surface again, he pledged. The Company has been engaged in a comprehensive program of remediation to address, among other things, the deficiencies reflected in the regulators' findings. The remedial steps undertaken demonstrate substantial and healthy introspection as well as the seriousness of our commitment to a strong control environment. The Board has overseen these remedial efforts, and has been focused on assuring that management's interactions with the Board and the Company's regulators are robust and timely. Our Company has learned from its mistakes, and our Board is confident that our management team is fully committed to ensuring they don't recur. A quick reminder of what the London Whale scandal was all about. The financial disaster blew up within JP Morgan's operations in the City, where a trader named Bruno Iksil was running billions of pounds worth of derivatives contracts, so huge that he was dubbed \"Voldemort\" for his power over the markets. Those market bets turned sour, though, at which points they were concealed by bank staff until they had swelled beyond control. JP Morgan shocked investors in May 2012 when they admitted what had gone on. Unwinding the mess cost the bank losses of$6bn. Repercussions were swift, for some. Ina Drew, the chief investment officer who oversaw the bank's London offices, resigned shortly after the case came to light. And last month, US prosecutors charged two bankers with four counts of falsification of books, wire fraud and making false statements to US regulators. Iksil has not been charged, and appears to be co-operating with prosecutors over the case. The Whale episode has been seen as evidence that the financial sector was still not being controlled tightly enough, several years after the financial crisis blew up. It has also been cited as evidence that Too Big To Fail banks should be broken up -- although JP Morgan appears to have absorbed the Whale losses. Here's another stinging rebuke for JP Morgan --- the FCA says the bank's conduct \"demonstrated flaws permeating all levels of the firm: from portfolio level right up to senior management\". From today's announcement: During the first half of 2012, JPMorgan failed to be open and co-operative with the FCA in that it concealed the extent of the losses as well as numerous serious and significant issues regarding the situation in the SCP. JPMorgan\u2019s failings were extremely serious and undermined trust and confidence in UK financial markets. And in the Final Notice served against the Wall Street titan, the FCA said it had been misled itself: In the first half of 2012 the Firm failed to be open and co-operative with the Authority about the extent of the losses as well as other serious and significant issues regarding the risk situation in the SCP, and on one occasion (by virtue of the conduct of CIO London Management) deliberately misled the Authority. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has blasted JP Morgan for its \"weak management\" and \"inadequate response\" to the London Whale scandal. Tracey McDermott, the FCA\u2019s director of enforcement and financial crime said: When the scale of the problems at JPMorgan became apparent, it sent a shock-wave through the markets. Maintaining the integrity of markets is a key part of our wholesale conduct agenda. We consider JPMorgan\u2019s failings to be extremely serious such as to undermine the trust and confidence in UK financial markets. This is yet another example of a firm failing to get a proper grip on the risks its business poses to the market. There were basic failings in the operation of fundamental controls over a high risk part of the business. Senior management failed to respond properly to warning signals that there were problems in the CIO. As things began to go wrong, the firm didn\u2019t wake up quickly enough to the size and the scale of the problems. What is worse, they compounded this by failing to be open and co-operative with us as their regulator. The \u00a3137m fine announced today is the second-largest ever, and would have been \u00a3196m if the company hasn't settled at an early stage. Here's the announcement from the US Treasury Department. And here's the announcement from the UK's FCA, explaining why it has fined JP Morgan \u00a3137,610,000 (its part of the bank's $920m penalty). The rumours were true... JP Morgan has been hit with penalties totaling around $920m over the London Whale scandal, in which the investment bank ran up $6bn of losses through reckless derivatives trading. Here's the Reuters snaps: 19-Sep-2013 14:00 - REGULATORY AGENCIES FINE JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO JPM.N TOTAL OF ABOUT $920 MILLION OVER THE LONDON WHALE TRADING SCANDAL - FEDERAL RESERVE 19-Sep-2013 14:00 - FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SAYS JPMORGAN WILL PAY $200 MLN PENALTY FOR DEFICIENCIES IN CO'S OVERSIGHT,MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS GOVERNING ITS CIO 19-Sep-2013 14:00 - OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY ASSESSED PENALTY OF $300 MLN AGAINST JPM ON UNSAFE AND UNSOUND PRACTICES AND VIOLATIONS OF LAW 19-Sep-2013 14:00 - THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM ISSUED AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST JPM, INCLUDING A PENALTY ASSESSMENT OF 137.6 MLN POUNDS The weekly US jobs data is out, and for the second week running it's a little unclear. The US claimant count appears to have risen last week, with 309,000 people filing new claims for jobless benefit. That's an increase on last week's 294,000. However, the Labor Department cautioned that two states, California and Nevada, are still working through a backlog of claims following computer problems, after an IT upgrade. Those glitches mean last week's data isn't completely reliable either -- the initial claims number could be higher.... Over in Italy, prime minister Enrico Letta has rebuffed Silvio Berlusconi's attack on the country's judges last night. Speaking at a press conference in Rome, Letta insisted that the Italian legal system was clean, saying: There is no persecution in Italy. In Italy, we respect the independence of the justice system and the work of the magistrates. Letta also said that he wouldn't let his administration become a \"punching ball\" for its coalition members (Berlusconi's centre-right PDL group and the left-wing PD party). Quotes via Reuters. As covered in yesterday's blog, Berlusconi claimed in his video message that he was the victim of judicial persecution. He also vowed to remain in politics even if he is ejected from the Senate over his tax fraud conviction. That prospect moved a little closer last night, when a Senate committee passed a procedural motion saying Berlusconi should be expelled. The final stage in that process is a full vote on the floor of the Senate, which should happen sometime in late October (updated) Some analysts were speculating last night, though, that Berlusconi could voluntarily step down first in a face-saving maneuver. Here's our news story on Ireland's recession ending in the last quarter (see here for earlier details) Ireland officially exits recession Karl Whelan, professor of economics at University College Dublin, has warned Ireland is lagging behind its bailout targets this year (particularly as the 0.4% GDP growth recorded last quarter was below forecasts). Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports that a mood of anger and fear has gripped the country following the brutal death of leading leftwing hip hop artist Pavlos Fyssas, whose funeral took place this morning. No wonder prime minister Antonis Samaras called for calm today (see 11.40am). Helena writes: Something has stirred in Greece. The brutal murder of the anti-fascist musician Pavlos Fyssas has not only shocked a nation already suffering the corrosive effects of almost four years of austerity and six years of recession, but appears to have galvanized Greek politicians to finally do something about Golden Dawn. \u201cThe government has declared war on Golden Dawn,\u201d ran one headline in the mass-selling Ta Nea. Highlighting the mood, deputy prime Evangelos Venizelos, whose Pasok party is the junior partner in the ruling coalition, insisted his morning that Golden Dawn \u201cshould be dealt with as a criminal organization\" because violence was its modus operandi. More than 300 attacks, starting with murder of a Bangladeshi immigrant in May 2011, have been attributed to supporters of the openly racist group. \u201cThe Greek government has been inexcusably tolerant with the phenomenon that is Golden Dawn,\u201d a senior official confided today. \u201cBut the truth is, under the Greek constitution, it is very hard to ban Golden Dawn.\u201d The media has joined the chorus of those now demanding that action be taken. \u201cThe healthy forces of this country should form a front against those who invest in chaos and raw violence,\u201d exhorted Eleftheros Typos, the country\u2019s leading right wing daily. Running street battles between stone-throwing extremists on both the left and right have underpinned the increasingly electric atmosphere with commentators describing the murder as politically-motivated. It was in this climate that the funeral of Pavlos Fyssas took place this morning with mourners chanting incendiary slogans such as \u201cwhen blood flows, it demands revenge\u201d and \u201cthe people don\u2019t forget. Death to fascism.\u201d Indicative of the mood, the hip-hop artist\u2019s father told one TV station that he wanted the murderer \u201cnot to be tried and imprisoned but executed. For me that is justice.\u201d The alleged perpetrator, a self-confessed member of Golden Dawn identified as Girogos Roupakias, appears before an investigating magistrate on Saturday. Greece's prime minister, Antonis Samaras, has called on the country's population to remain calm following the murder of Pavlos Fyssas, who has been laid to rest this morning. It's his first official comment on Fyssas's death, and comes after last night's protests. Athens correspondent Helena Smith has translated Samara's statement, and reports: The Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has just appealed to Greeks for calm saying: \"this is not the time for internal squabbles. Or tension. We all know that our country is at an extremely critical point. And our nation is enduring the biggest sacrifices to emerge as victims in this crisis and to achieve economic renewal. Any political differences should be resolved through democratic dialogue .. not with violence and, even more, not with blood.\" Nick Malkoutzis of Kathimerini also tweeted some key points: European stock markets are climbing even higher this morning, as the no-taper relief rally gathers pace. Even though Ben Bernanke was gloomier about US economic prospects, the fact that the Federal Reserve will keep pumping $85bn per month into the economy is enough for the City, for now. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 94 points at 6653, + 1.44% \u2022 German DAX: up 96 points at 8732, + 1.12%. On track for a new alltime high \u2022 French CAC: up 44 points at 4215,+ 1.1%. On track for the highest close since 2008 But how long will the punchbowl remain full? Jeremy Batstone-Carr of Charles Stanley, who had expected tapering to start last night, reckon it's still coming soon. Probably once US politicians have resolved the looming row of whether or not to raise America's debt ceiling. From his morning note: The reaction across financial markets was as dramatic as it was significant but we cannot help but think that the financial markets would be unwise to price out a taper altogether. We fear that the Fed has migrated from garble to blunder. Tapered bond purchases are coming, it is merely a question of when. The secondary move in bond markets will, as like as not, be to see bond yields rising again. This is not relief, it is merely a postponement. Breaking news: Ireland has exited recession after a nine-month contraction. Irish GDP grew by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2013, data just released showed. However, that's only half as strong as the 0.8% rise in output which economists had expected. And gross national product (GNP) which strips out the impact of multinational countries based in Ireland, fell by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. Here's the full statement. Heads-up: Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras is expected to make a TV statement soon, on the death of Pavlos Fyssas, and the Golden Dawn party: Pavlos Fyssas's funeral (see 9.17am) is underway in Athens, and appears to be well attended. One more point on the Greek jobless rate -- although it's down quarter-on-quarter, it's still much higher than a year ago (27.1% versus 23.6% in Q2 2012). And the data's not seasonally adjusted. From Athens, Dimitris Bounias points out means it's affected by the tourist season \"traditionally massively but temporarily raising Greek employment\". And here's a graph showing how Greece's young people are suffering the most from its jobless crisis, despite today's welcome drop in the unemployment rate: The Greek unemployment rate has dropped slightly, according to new data, but still remains at depression-era levels. ELSTAT reports that the jobless rate was 27.1% in the second quarter of this year, down from 27.4% in January-March. It's the first drop in the quarterly rate since 2009, and the early days of the crisis. Today's data shows a small rise in the number of people in employment, perhaps reflecting seasonal changes as Greece's tourism sector picked up pace. Here's the data It also showed that the unemployment rate for females is considerably higher than for males, at 31,1% versus 24.1%. And youth unemployment remains at critical levels, with almost six in ten people between 15 and 24 reported as out of work. UK retail sales were weaker than expected in August -- dropping by 0.9% compared with July. A big drop in food spending is to blame, down 2.7% month-on-month. It appears people cut back on picnicking and barbecuing as August's weather failed to quite match the glorious July. As James Knightley of ING explains: The main story is that food sales fell 2.7% month-on-month, reversing the sharp weather related gains in July when people were eating out in the sunshine. Household goods sales were down 1.6% month-on-month while vehicle fuel sales fell 0.6%. However, clothing sales were up 1.1%. On a year-on-year basis, August retail sales were 2.1% higher than a year ago -- when much of Britain stayed at home to watch the Olympics and Paralympics. And here's Kathimerini's latest take on the situation in Athens following Pavlos Fyssas's death: Giorgos Roupakios, the 45-year-old charged with Fyssas' murder, is to defend himself before an investigating magistrate at 9 am. on Saturday. On Wednesday night, he faced a Piraeus prosecutor and requested three days to prepare his defense. According to sources, the police requested access to the suspect's telephone records in order to check the calls he made and received on Tuesday night when Fyssas was stabbed to death in the neighborhood of Amfiali, southern Athens. On Thursday, the suspect's wife and cousin as well as the secretary of the Piraeus office of Golden Dawn were expected to face a prosecutor. The wife and cousin face charges of making a false statement after allegedly claiming to have thrown away an extendable truncheon and Golden Dawn pamphlets that had been in the couple\u2019s home before the truncheon was discovered in a raid on GD's Piraeus office. According to a friend of Roupakios' quoted by To Vima, the latter was on Golden Dawn's payroll as were members of his family. Around 130 people were detained by Greek police last night, of whom 34 have been formally arrested. Many of those detained appeared to be young people. Many people on the streets claimed that riot police were effectively protecting supporters of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party (the man accused of murdering Pavlos Fyssas had close links to the party). Greek media are reporting that the funeral of murdered hip hop artist Pavlos Fyssas is about to take place in Athens. Helena Smith, our correspondent, says a huge turnout of anti-fascist friends and supporters is expected following a night of violent clashes across Greece. This video clip shows a group of men throwing stones, while standing alongside Greek riot policemen: In other central bank news, the Swiss National Bank has reiterated that it will continue to peg the Swiss franc against the euro - to prevent it strengthening any higher. The SNB said the cap was 'essential' to protect Switzerland's economy, and also hiked its growth forecasts for next year to between 1.5% and 2%, from between 1% to 1.5%. Bloomberg has more details. There's a decidedly mixed reaction to the Fed's decision not to taper in the UK media this morning. Some economics writers think Bernanke has botched it, while others are amazed that the Fed even considered tapering at all. Here's a selection of views. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott : Fed delay is no reason to celebrate The Fed's caution has confirmed that all is not well in the US economy. The taper was supposed to be a demonstration of strength; that after five years of ultra-stimulative monetary policy the time was coming closer when the economy would be able to stand on its own feet. By definition, therefore, the no-taper decision is an admission of weakness. Gavyn Davies in the FT: Never underestimate the Fed\u2019s dovishness We have to conclude that the FOMC is more reluctant to taper than the market had come to believe, and that their decisions will be data dependent, with no firm eye on the calendar guidance they previously offered. We should also conclude that the danger that QE will cause an excessive amount of risk taking in parts of the financial system is not, in their minds, a sufficient condition to slow the growth in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. A journalist asked Mr Bernanke in the press conference whether he would ever see any clear grounds for stepping away from QE, and he answered rather hesitantly that this required a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labour market. There was no hint that fears of a financial bubble would induce him to act any sooner than that criterion implied. The bottom line is that the period in which the markets can expect the Fed to be aggressively easy has once more been lengthened as a result of this decision. Yet again, we discover that it is dangerous to bet against the innate dovishness of the Fed and its current chairman. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in the Telegraph: Fed recoils from 1937 tightening error as jobs evaporate It would be a grave error for the Fed to taper bond purchases at all at this juncture, given the risks for Brazil, India, Turkey, South Africa, Indonesia, Ukraine and others already facing a turn in the credit cycle, and given the danger of another eurozone debt spasm, as happened at the end of QE1 and the end of QE2. The Bernanke Fed has twice misjudged the global effects of premature tightening already, each time precipitating a credit and stock market crash within weeks, and each time forcing the Fed to capitulate. Third time lucky? Allister Heath in City AM: Sorry, investors, but Ben Bernanke has got it totally wrong Most central bankers are making a fatal error: the belief that the micro-management of aggregate demand is the answer to all of our problems. It isn\u2019t. Of course, the Fed was right to act when the economy began to implode: one (but not the only one) of the great lessons of the 1930s depression, as expounded by Milton Friedman and Anna J Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States is that the money supply should never be allowed to collapse. But to agree to that proposition is very different from thinking that policy should respond to every blip in data, every worry about construction output. For all the talk of rules, the status quo is about extreme discretion. At issue is a classic confusion. Monetary stimulus can help economic activity in the short-term \u2013 but not in the long-term, when what economists call real factors such as productivity growth determine output, jobs and wages. The US economy is suffering from a real, supply-side crisis, with wages under pressure and fewer people finding work. No amount of QE will solve this. Ben Bernanke is tilting at windmills. It will all end in tears. Brenda Kelly of IG flags up that nearly every share on the entire London stock market is up. Britain's borrowing costs have taken a dive this morning too. The yield on 10-year gilts has tumbled by 16 basis points to 2.833%. That's a really big one-day move, as the graph above shows. It tracks the drop in US Treasury yields last night, which also plummeted once it became clear that the taper was a rarer species than the markets thought. Bernanke was pretty clear that the Fed had been alarmed by the sharp rise in long-term interest rates since June, when it first put tapering on the agenda. And he's now managed to talk them down again. This is a bit tipsy-topsy, though. Effectively, the Fed hasn't tapered because market interest rates rose, because it was about to taper..... The top riser on the FTSE 100 is Randgold Resources, the gold producer, which has jumped by over 10%. The gold price leapt last night as Ben Bernanke proved to be far more dovish than (many) analysts had expected. Here's the biggest rises on the FTSE 100 this morning, driving the blue-chip index up over 80 points: The French CAC has hit its highest level since 2008. The London stock market is open, and shares are surging as City investors react to the Fed's decision to hold off from tapering its QE package. The FTSE 100 has jumped 81 points at open, to 6636, a gain of 1.2%. Every single share on the Footsie is up, with mining companies leading the charge. And the German DAX has surged to a new record high..... Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC, says it's party time in Asia again: Markets are thrilled, and much needed reprieve for battered EM investors is on its way. With Chinese data having turned up, and the Bank of Japan running at full speed, it looks like Asia might get its mojo back. Here's the Asian market situation: The Fed's decision not to taper its QE programme has given emerging markets a real boost. Most currencies are strongly higher against the US dollar, with the Indian Rupee at a one-month high of 61.7 to the dollar and the Thai baht at a two-month high. As fastFT flags up, this is excellent timing for India's new central bank governor, Raghuram Rajan, who has his own interest rate decision tomorrow. \"India has got a get out jail of free card from the Fed. The question now is whether and how they will use that card,\" says Sanjeev Prasad, head of research at brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities. The Russian stock market is already open, and has jumped by 4%. Not long until we see Europe's reaction..... If you missed the Fed drama last night, here's Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe's story, filed as the Dow Jones index hit a new record high. US stock markets hit record highs Wednesday as the Federal Reserve surprised investors by announcing that the economic recovery was too fragile to cut back on its massive $85bn-a-month stimulus program. After a two-day meeting, the federal open market committee (FOMC) said it required \"more evidence that progress will be sustained\". The news delighted the markets which had sunk ahead of the news on fears that the Fed was preparing to \"taper\" the so-called quantitative easing (QE) program. Even the threat of a slight reduction in the stimulus spooked the markets in July. But the news also underlined the precarious state of the wider economy as a row over the US's debt limit threatens a government shutdown. In a press conference Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, warned that the current row could have \"very serious consequences\". More here: Federal Reserve maintains bond-buying stimulus in surprise move Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. World stock markets are rallying following the Federal Reserve's decision last night to continue its huge money-printing stimulus package, dashing expectations that it would start slowing the programme. The news that the Fed had stepped back from tapering the $85bn per month asset purchase scheme has already sent Asian markets surging, even though the Fed also cut its growth forecasts and sounded much more worried about the US economy. Japan's Nikkei just closed at an eight week high, having surged 1.8%, and there's clear relief in emerging markets too - with India's Sensex jumping 2.6% so far. We're expecting big gains in Europe when trading begins. IG early calls are: \u2022 FTSE: up 76 points at 6634 \u2022 German DAX: up 107 points at 8743 \u2022 French CAC: up 58 points at 4228 Money has also been pouring into government bonds, pushing borrowing costs down. With Wall Street hitting a record high last night, the party is set to continue in the stock markets for a while, it seems. As Kit Juckes of Societe Generale tweets: But beneath the short-term euphoria, there's no getting away from the fact that the Fed doesn't think the US economy is strong enough to be weaned off QE. Five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, we're still dependent on ultra-loose monetary policy. Capital Economics, for example, fears trouble ahead: We wonder whether the longer lasting reaction will be increased volatility in markets, as the Fed's communications become even more confused. I'll be tracking the markets through the day, along with other key events. That will include developments in Greece, where anti-fascist protesters and police clashed last night following the murder of left-wing rapper Pavlos Fyssas yesterday.",

    "webTitle": "Federal Reserve tapering decision has baffled the markets", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The dust was still settling on Thursday after the Federal Reserve delivered one of the biggest surprises to financial markets in many a year. This was a return to the central banking practices of the past when policymakers liked to keep people guessing about their intentions. These days central bankers pride themselves on their transparency. But nobody is sure any longer what the Fed is really up to. Clearly it got cold feet about announcing even the most modest reduction in the amount of stimulus provided to the US economy through its long-term asset purchase programme, but both the decision and the way it was announced raised more questions than they answered. Why was there no warning to the markets that the Fed was worried about the slowdown in growth? Why, in the absence of such a warning, did it not go ahead with a tokenist reduction in the stimulus, of say $5bn (\u00a33.17bn) a month, that would have made good the commitment to start tapering but had no material impact on growth? What will it now take for the Fed to start winding down the stimulus? But although the Fed's communications strategy now lies in tatters, some conclusions can be drawn from the postponement of the taper. Firstly, policy is going to remain loose for longer than the markets envisaged. It is hard to see how the Fed can start to scale back its quantitative easing programme this year, and the prospect of the process being completed in 2014 \u2013 as originally envisaged \u2013 is as good as dead. Secondly, the Fed is even more doveish than the markets thought. When Ben Bernanke first floated the idea of the taper back in May, the notion was that the trigger for the taper would be falling unemployment. But despite a continued moderate improvement in the labour market, the Fed still feels the time is not ripe to act. It took fright when speculation about the taper led to rising bond yields, making mortgages more expensive. It looked askance when share prices fell. And it is worried about the possible consequences of the looming budget showdown between Democrats and Republicans in Washington. So when the time came to act, it blinked. Thirdly, the Fed has provided a respite \u2013 albeit probably temporary \u2013 to emerging markets that had seen their currencies fall against the dollar in anticipation of a gradual withdrawal of the stimulus. Finally, the muted second day reaction to the decision was the reaction to one final unanswered question: does the Fed have the remotest idea how to unwind the stimulus? As Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities put it: Bernanke has given the \"impression of being astride a tiger he dare not dismount.\"",

      "body": "<p>The dust was still settling on Thursday after the Federal Reserve delivered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/18/federal-reserve-maintains-stimulus-ben-bernanke\" title=\"\">one of the biggest surprises to financial markets</a> in many a year. This was a return to the central banking practices of the past when policymakers liked to keep people guessing about their intentions. These days central bankers pride themselves on their transparency.</p> <p>But nobody is sure any longer what the Fed is really up to. Clearly it got cold feet about announcing even the most modest reduction in the amount of stimulus provided to the US economy through its long-term asset purchase programme, but both the decision and the way it was announced raised more questions than they answered.</p> <p>Why was there no warning to the markets that the Fed was worried about the slowdown in growth? Why, in the absence of such a warning, did it not go ahead with a tokenist reduction in the stimulus, of say $5bn (\u00a33.17bn) a month, that would have made good the commitment to start tapering but had no material impact on growth? What will it now take for the Fed to start winding down the stimulus?</p> <p>But although the Fed's communications strategy now lies in tatters, some conclusions can be drawn from the postponement of the taper. Firstly, policy is going to remain loose for longer than the markets envisaged. It is hard to see how the Fed can start to scale back its quantitative easing programme this year, and the prospect of the process being completed in 2014 \u2013 as originally envisaged \u2013 is as good as dead.</p> <p>Secondly, the Fed is even more doveish than the markets thought. When Ben Bernanke first floated the idea of the taper back in May, the notion was that the trigger for the taper would be falling unemployment. But despite a continued moderate improvement in the labour market, the Fed still feels the time is not ripe to act. It took fright when speculation about the taper led to rising bond yields, making mortgages more expensive. It looked askance when share prices fell. And it is worried about the possible consequences of the looming budget showdown between Democrats and Republicans in Washington. So when the time came to act, it blinked.</p> <p>Thirdly, the Fed has provided a respite \u2013 albeit probably temporary \u2013 to emerging markets that had seen their currencies fall against the dollar in anticipation of a gradual withdrawal of the stimulus.</p> <p>Finally, the muted second day reaction to the decision was the reaction to one final unanswered question: does the Fed have the remotest idea how to unwind the stimulus? As Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities put it: Bernanke has given the \"impression of being astride a tiger he dare not dismount.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's consumers took a break from shopping last month as consumer spending fell back from the high levels recorded in July. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the volume of retail sales dropped by 0.9% in August \u2013 mainly as the result of weaker demand for food. The ONS said that supermarkets had been particularly busy in July during the hottest of the summer weather but that activity came back to more normal levels in August. After the recent run of strong economic news, the City had been expecting retail sales to grow by 0.4% between July and August, and the pound fell when the figures were released. Food sales dropped 2.7% in August, and there was little evidence of the recent pickup in housing activity helping sales of household goods, which fell by 1.6%. Over the three months to August \u2013 considered a better guide to consumer sentiment than one month's figures \u2013 retail sales were up by 1.7%. Annual growth \u2013 comparing the latest quarter with the same three months in 2012 \u2013 stood at 2.3%, the ONS said. The official figures also appear to demonstrate Britain's increasing love of online shopping. The ONS said non-store retail sales grew by 29% between August 2012 and August 2013 and that there had been a marked upward trend since the turn of the year. \"Since January 2013, the non-store retailing sector has seen continued year-on-year growth in both the amount spent and bought in this sector,\" the ONS said. James Knightley, an economist at ING, said: \"It is a disappointing outcome that has taken the wind out of the sails of sterling for now, but the underlying story still looks good, with the three-month-on-month total sales growth still up 1.7%, consumer confidence rising, employment increasing and credit availability improving.\" Chris Williamson, chief economist at the market data provider Markit, believes the figures still augured well for the UK economy. He said: \"Consumers pulled back on their retail spending after a spending spree in July, but retail sales are still trending higher at the fastest rate since mid-2007, meaning the economy looks set to have grown strongly in the third quarter.\" David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: \"Despite the fall in August, the long-term trend in retail sales is positive.\" The wider increase in retail sales has emerged alongside a resurgence in house prices, which saw the ONS confirming this week that the housing market has surpassed its previous peak in 2008. George Osborne played down fears of a bubble on Wednesday, saying that he was \"alert to the risks\", adding: \"But let's not pretend there's a housing boom.\"",

While the RBA is not too concerned yet, noting that \u201chouseholds continued to show prudence in managing their finances\u201d, it did express some concern regarding \u201cself-managed superannuation funds\u201d investing in the housing market. The RBA noted that SMSFs were \"one area identified where households could be starting to take some risk with their finances\u201d and the RBA indicated it would \u201cclosely monitor\u201d the situation. And so, notwithstanding the RBA\u2019s desire for a low value of the dollar, our currency rose as traders took the view that this meant interest rates were more likely to rise than fall. Then last night the US Federal Reserve announced it would continue its quantitative easing a bit longer \u2013 and so our dollar went up again to US$0.95. Thus, in the time between the Coalition winning the election and being sworn into government, the dollar has risen by more than 4%. I hope Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey enjoy the ride.",
