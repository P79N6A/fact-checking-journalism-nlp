      "bodyText": "Tina Green, the wife of billionaire businessman Sir Philip Green, has joined her husband in being called to face MPs on two select committees to answer questions about the collapse of BHS. Lady Green, a trustee of the company, and Sir Philip will be questioned by the work and pensions committee about where hundreds of millions of pounds went from BHS and how its \u00a3571m pension deficit will affect Britain\u2019s Pension Protection Fund, a rescue scheme funded by contributions from other pension pots. MPs on the business committee also want to question the couple as part of its inquiry into the sale and acquisition of BHS. Sir Philip has been asked to say when he will be available to appear \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d for the special joint hearing for the entrepreneur. Dominic Chappell, who led a consortium called Retail Acquisitions that bought BHS for \u00a31 last year, is also being called as a witness by MPs. Frank Field, chair of the committee, said: \u201cThe spine of our inquiry is looking at how and where money went out of the company, to whom it went, and how this may have disadvantaged the pensioners.\u201d Allan Leighton, the chairman of the Co-operative Group, is understood to be considering a rescue bid for part of BHS, nine years after leaving the chain. Administrators, who were appointed last week, are hoping to sell at least part of BHS as a going concern and save some of the 11,000 jobs at risk. Leighton, a previous boss of Asda and the Royal Mail, is among up to 10 potential bidders looking at buying up to 60 BHS stores, and possibly the brand name, too. Other contenders are believed to include Sports Direct, Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day, B&amp;M Stores and Yousuf Bhailok, a Preston-based millionaire property owner. Sir Philip has also been rumoured to be considering buying back the chain that he sold to the consortium led by Chappell, a former bankrupt. Chappell, who led BHS into administration with debts of \u00a31.3bn, has also claimed he is considering a bid for the company. He said: \u201cWe have some angles and we have a reasonable chance of getting a bid in.\u201d A spokesman for BHS said such an idea was \u201cpure fantasy\u201d. Leighton tried to buy the chain from Green nine years ago, just before the former Asda boss stepped down as chairman of BHS. The retail heavyweight was chairman of BHS between 2000 and 2007, during which time he was paid more than \u00a32.6m. Under his chairmanship, more than \u00a3422m in dividends was paid out to BHS shareholders, including the Green family, ragtrade entrepreneur Richard Caring and Scottish multimillionaire Sir Tom Hunter. Leighton was not a shareholder, but was responsible for the running of the business, which was profitable throughout his tenure and had net pension assets of \u00a33.4m before tax in March 2008, three months after he left. Leighton\u2019s interest in buying BHS comes as those involved in the troubled chain\u2019s history are likely to face scrutiny. The Guardian has revealed that former racing driver Chappell could be forced to return millions of pounds paid to his consortium during its controversial 13-month ownership of BHS. The legal director of BHS has written to Chappell asking him for \u00a350,000 that has not been repaid after he moved \u00a31.5m from the retailer to an obscure corporate vehicle in the days before the store chain\u2019s collapse. Meanwhile, the BHS administrators are also examining whether loans paid to Retail Acquisitions, Chappell\u2019s consortium, can be called in. City grandee Paul Myners said there were \u201cbig questions that need to be asked about the stewardship of this company under the ownership of Lady Green and the management of Sir Philip Green\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A \u00a323m pay deal for the chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser will come into focus this week when the Dettol-to-Durex maker puts its remuneration plans to the vote at its annual general meeting. Rakesh Kapoor\u2019s package \u2013 twice what he received the year before \u2013 has been described by one shareholder as a misjudgment of the mood of investors, who have marked 2016 as the year they are prepared to say no to exorbitant pay deals. Boardroom bosses will be trying to gauge whether the revolts, which got this year\u2019s season off to a blistering start, can be maintained. With BP and Smith &amp; Nephew still reeling from No votes at the start of April, Shire Pharmaceuticals and fellow FTSE 100 member CRH were last week rebuked by investors, while in the FTSE 250, engineering firm Weir had to abandon plans to issue shares to its directors after a resounding protest. \u201cThis AGM season is shaping up to be the most raucous on record,\u201d said Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors. \u201cI welcome the fact that shareholders are finding their voice.\u201d The mood appears to be hardening even compared with the so-called shareholder spring of 2012, which delivered boardrooms their first jolt since May 2003 \u2013 when GlaxoSmith-Kline\u2019s \u00a322m deal for then chief Jean-Pierre Garnier was rejected. That was the first time shareholders had had a direct vote on pay. In 2013 the system changed, with the advisory vote on remuneration reports covering that year\u2019s pay now supplemented by a second vote on remuneration policy for the upcoming three years. Crucially, that vote is binding. Walker said: \u201cInvestors are still getting used to their new binding vote, and have seemed cautious about using it so far, perhaps waiting to see whether boards pre-emptively addressed concerns on executive pay. It is vital that boards do this. The binding vote has not yet had the desired effect and shareholders are making their displeasure clear.\u201d The annual meeting season continues this week. On Thursday, Reckitt will ask investors to vote on its pay report and new remuneration policy, which reduces the maximum number of shares that can be awarded to Kapoor but still means he can get multiples of his salary in shares. The company hopes to head off a revolt by emphasising its performance \u2013 its stock market value is up \u00a321bn in three years. Other companies holding AGMs include Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of Scotland, Glaxo and Aviva, whose chief executive, Andrew Moss, was forced out in the 2012 revolt. Investors are also focusing on companies outside the FTSE 100, including Man Group, the hedge fund firm that awarded chief executive Manny Roman a 10% salary rise for 2016. Its AGM is on Friday and in its annual report points out that Roman has not had a salary rise for five years, while performance has improved. In the coming weeks there will also be meetings of Shell and WPP, which announced last Friday that chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell had received \u00a370.4m for 2015. WPP responded to a revolt by changing its bonus schemes: investors are scrutinising the small print of this year\u2019s deal before deciding how to vote in June. Sorrell has set out his case that he is being paid for performance. Pay revolts are often sparked when this link breaks down. They can also happen when shareholders are caught unawares \u2013 as happened last week with Shire\u2019s 25% salary rise for chief executive Flemming \u00d8rnskov. There also signs that investors are focusing on absolute pay. Stefan Stern of the High Pay Centre is calling for the disclosure of pay ratios \u2013 comparing the boss\u2019s reward with average pay in the company \u2013 as a way to keep boardrooms in check. The idea was also raised last week by major investor Legal &amp; General. \u201cIf public disapproval and shame is what it takes, that sort of disclosure could be helpful,\u201d he said. He pointed out that shareholder action tends to come in waves, and hopes this year\u2019s will have a lasting impact. Peter Montagnon, a key figure at the Association of British Insurers at the time of the Glaxo revolt who is now at the Institute of Business Ethics, agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s possible that this time will be different because of public awareness of inequality, and recognition that the system is pretty well broken.\u201d A report produced under the auspices of the Investment Association, which has taken on the governance monitoring previously done by the ABI, concluded last month that the current approach to executive pay is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. Montagnon said: \u201cThere is a case for root-and-branch reform but all sides would have to agree it needs to change. Some companies like the present system because they feel they can game it. Some shareholders like it because they make a living out of it and prefer to stay in their comfort zone.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In the Slough branch of BHS, the staff wear jumpers under their uniforms in winter: the heating in the store has not worked for years. It is a small detail, but one that explains a lot about the chain\u2019s predicament: years of underinvestment that weakened the 88-year-old retailer\u2019s grip on the high street. The Slough store is at the wrong end of a tired high street, a couple of doors down from a pub called Wernham Hoggs (after David Brent\u2019s workplace in The Office), and trapped in a Poundland pincer movement after the takeover of 99p Stores left the discount chain with two shops almost side by side. On Thursday morning, the branch is nevertheless bustling as predatory customers flick through the clothing rails, sniffing out the hefty markdowns that signal the beginning of the end. \u201cWe feel let down,\u201d says one long-serving staff member who, despite the uncertainty, is toiling with dignity on the shop floor, intermittently dealing with blunt requests to do the maths involved in the day\u2019s 30% off \u201cspectacular\u201d. \u201cPhilip Green has had his money and now he doesn\u2019t care. All of us live locally and have relied on this job.\u201d It is a sad irony, she adds, that after years of \u201cshit wages\u201d, April was the first month their pay packets had been boosted by the new \u201cnational living wage\u201d. It could be the last month too, as the BHS\u2019s administrators attempt to broker a rescue deal. To say it has been a bruising week for Sir Philip Green would be an understatement. Although he was not BHS\u2019s owner at the time of its collapse \u2013 having offloaded it in 2015 for \u00a31 to a group of little-known investors \u2013 he is being widely blamed for the \u00a3571m deficit in its pension fund. That fund is now being assessed to enter the Pension Protection Fund, and the gaping hole in its assets is being compared to the \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans paid to Green\u2019s family and other shareholders during his 15-year ownership. The collapse of BHS, which employs 11,000 people, is the biggest failure to hit the high street since the demise of Woolworths in 2008. The need to bail out the pension fund means thousands of workers face a cut in pension entitlements \u2013 a situation that has encouraged a former member of its management team, Lin Macmillan, to mount a campaign. She is demanding Green do the right thing, and urging colleagues to contact her at selltheyachtspaythepensions@gmail.com. \u201cI worked at BHS during the 80s when it was thriving,\u201d says Macmillan, who bemoans the lack of investment in its stores and brand. \u201cIt has stayed the same, and you can\u2019t stay the same in retailing.\u201d The loss-making retailer had annual sales of \u00a3668m at the last count but under Green it bled market share in clothing to nimbler rivals such as Primark and the supermarkets. Share nearly halved to 1.4% during his ownership. \u201cI buy my swimwear and my boots there,\u201d says Tina Hill, out shopping with her mother in Slough. \u201cBHS caters for bigger people. Its OK if you are a size 10 to shop at Primark, but if you have got big hips and big tits you\u2019ve got no chance.\u201d Hill says BHS\u2019s clothing had \u201cgone downhill,\u201d pointing to rivals such as Bonmarch\u00e9, which has signed up designer David Emanuel, best known for having designed the wedding dress worn by Diana, Princess of Wales, to boost its fashion credentials. Some shoppers enthuse about BHS\u2019s homewares, particularly its lighting, as well as the keen sale prices, but the stark drop in market share reflects that even its core, older audience had become alienated. Its lack of fashionability was compounded by a depressed store estate that, beyond its flagships, had fallen behind rivals. In Slough, for example, shoppers last week were still being greeted with a tired display of marked-down Easter eggs. \u201cBHS would have performed better if it had had more investment,\u201d says Richard Hyman, the independent retail expert. BHS, he says is one of four original variety-store chains \u2013 a list that at one time included Littlewoods and Woolworths as well as the only survivor of the group, Marks &amp; Spencer. \u201cThe variety store was conceived as the poor man\u2019s department store,\u201d he explains. In the latter years of Green\u2019s ownership, he focused financial resources on its more successful sister group Arcadia, the fashion giant behind eight brands including Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Evans. In an effort to boost sales, Green parachuted a handful of Arcadia brands into BHS, with large Wallis and Dorothy Perkins departments dominating the Slough store\u2019s fashion offer. Two years ago it also started opening food halls. But BHS was loss-making in the eight years leading up to its collapse as it struggled to stay relevant on an increasingly competitive high street. Green\u2019s camp say his family shouldered losses of \u00a3255m to keep it going, and point to a dowry, of \u00a374m in cash and \u00a3100m of property, handed to the new owners. Hyman points to the rise of Primark. \u201cOver the period BHS has declined, Primark has added around \u00a32bn to its sales line. Green demonstrably should have sold BHS sooner, when it might have attracted more people to take it on.\u201d The vultures are now circling, and administrators Duff &amp; Phelps are claiming to have 50 expressions of interest in the business, although only 10 are thought to be serious. BHS\u2019s 164 stores are a mixed bag of leaseholds and freeholds, and it is unlikely that any buyer would want to take on the whole motley collection. Preston-based property millionaire Yousuf Bhailok, a former general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, has put his hat in the ring, while Allan Leighton, the retail turnaround specialist who currently chairs the Co-op, is also working on a bid. The serial chairman, who has also sat in the hot seat at Royal Mail, is famous for turning around Asda with Archie Norman in the early 1990s. Dominic Chappell, the twice-bankrupt former racing driver who bought BHS from Green, claims he too is working on a bid. However, this has been greeted with derision \u2013 not least because he and Green could be called to give evidence before MPs investigating the sale of BHS, including whether the directors of Green\u2019s Arcadia and Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions acted as well as they could to fulfil their statutory duties. It is unclear how long the administrators can keep BHS\u2019s stores open, but it is expected to be long enough to achieve a sale. One industry insider suggested it would only be possible for another retailer to take on BHS, as its supply chain has been severed. Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day and South African billionaire Christo Wiese, who is backing the UK launch of discount chain Pep &amp; Co, are among those linked to a deal. \u201cIf this store went, there would be nothing here [in Slough],\u201d says Hill. \u201cBHS is for the working person, you get good quality, good gear. When BHS has a sale, they have a sale.\u201d The biggest sale yet could be just around the corner.",

      "body": "<p>In the Slough branch of BHS, the staff wear jumpers under their uniforms in winter: the heating in the store has not worked for years. It is a small detail, but one that explains a lot about the chain\u2019s predicament: years of underinvestment that weakened the 88-year-old retailer\u2019s grip on the high&#xa0;street.</p> <p>The Slough store is at the wrong end of a tired high street, a couple of doors down from a pub called Wernham Hoggs (after David Brent\u2019s workplace in <em>The Office)</em>, and trapped in a Poundland pincer movement after the takeover of 99p Stores left the discount chain with two shops almost side by side.</p> <p>On Thursday morning, the branch is nevertheless bustling as predatory customers flick through the clothing rails, sniffing out the hefty markdowns that signal the beginning of the end.</p> <p>\u201cWe feel let down,\u201d says one long-serving staff member who, despite the uncertainty, is toiling with dignity on the shop floor, intermittently dealing with blunt requests to do the maths involved in the day\u2019s 30% off \u201cspectacular\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPhilip Green has had his money and now he doesn\u2019t care. All of us live locally and have relied on this job.\u201d</p> <p>It is a sad irony, she adds, that after years of \u201cshit wages\u201d, April was the first month their pay packets had been boosted by the new \u201cnational living wage\u201d. It could be the last month too, as the BHS\u2019s administrators attempt to broker a rescue deal.</p> <p>To say it has been a bruising week for Sir Philip Green would be an understatement. Although he was not BHS\u2019s owner at the time of its collapse \u2013 having offloaded it in 2015 for \u00a31 to a group of little-known investors \u2013 he is being widely blamed for the \u00a3571m deficit in its pension fund.</p> <p>That fund is now being assessed to enter the Pension Protection Fund, and the gaping hole in its assets is being compared to the \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans paid to Green\u2019s family and other shareholders during his 15-year ownership.</p> <p>The collapse of BHS, which employs 11,000 people, is the biggest failure to hit the high street since the demise of Woolworths in 2008.
