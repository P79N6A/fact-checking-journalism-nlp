    "webTitle": "CBI appears to back Heathrow over Gatwick for airport expansion", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The CBI is calling on the Airports Commission to recommend a single, larger hub airport for the UK, saying the move is critical for maintaining Britain's long-term economic growth. The CBI report, released on Monday, effectively endorses Heathrow over Gatwick, just days before the commission is due to decide whether to eliminate the Thames estuary airport option from its consideration. The call from Britain's leading business organisation attracted controversy after other airports received a press release that appeared to have been sent to Heathrow and back to the CBI before being issued to other parties, including the London mayor's office, which favours the Thames estuary option, and Gatwick. The report argues that hub airports are best placed to act as a catalyst for new routes, serving on average nearly three times as many destinations as point-to-point airports and having a higher frequency of flights. Katja Hall of the CBI said: \"UK business wants action. There can be no more excuses \u2013 we need to see the Airports Commission deliver a strong case for new capacity and a clear schedule for delivery.\" She said that while all airports could help develop UK connectivity, not all the airports played the same role. \"While no one can predict the future of air travel, the track record shows that it tends to be hub airports that deliver the new connections to emerging markets that we desperately need.\" Hall said Heathrow was full and research showed that when a hub became constrained airlines strengthened popular routes rather than investigating emerging markets. \"If we are to spark new connections that drive trade, we need a solution that creates spare capacity at a single-site hub,\" she added. John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow airport, said: \"This recommendation by the CBI essentially shows that British business is backing Heathrow as the UK's only hub airport to connect the country to global growth.\" The commission is expected to announce this week whether it will add the Thames estuary scheme, backed by London's mayor, Boris Johnson, to the shortlist for airport expansion, which at the moment consists of extra runways at either Heathrow or Gatwick. The mayor's aviation adviser, Daniel Moylan, said the Heathrow option was too constrained and too environmentally damaging for extra growth. \"A third runway there, on its own, would not offer the spare capacity the CBI rightly calls for,\" he said. \"And a second runway at Gatwick would of course mean that Britain had given up on having a hub airport altogether. So we need to find a new site for Heathrow, where it can grow. That should be to the east of the capital.\" A spokeswoman for Gatwick said the most important consideration for the commission was a solution that was both speedy and deliverable. She said: \"A new runway at Gatwick would liberate capacity for more hub traffic at Heathrow and provide UK with two world-class airports, able to address all travel markets and airline models. \"Once you take into account existing developments in aircraft technology and current aviation trends, it is clear that Gatwick is the best and obvious solution. We are surprised that in forming a view of the future of aviation policy, the CBI has chosen not to address the future of the industry itself. \"It is hard not to question the impartiality of a report that arrives in your inbox with Heathrow's email disclaimer attached to it.\" Asked why some material had gone via Heathrow and back to the CBI before reaching Gatwick, the CBI said it had been an administrative error. A spokesman said the CBI decided to give five member companies \"advanced sighting\" and while Heathrow was first, Gatwick was sent the report a little over an hour later, when the sender copied and pasted over the information from the earlier email. Heathrow said it first received the report on Friday morning, and had issued its own public response soon afterwards, shortly before Gatwick saw the report. John Stewart, the chair of the Heathrow opposition group Hacan (Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise), said: \"It's clear that the CBI has plumped for Heathrow without giving any consideration whether a third runway is politically deliverable in the real world. Although branded as an independent report it would not surprise me at all if Heathrow had not used its influence within the CBI to get this result.\"",

      "bodyText": "The troubled Co-op group must now bring in a top-class chairman and chief executive from outside, Lord Myners has warned, after members backed the bulk of his proposals to reform the mutual business The City grandee, who earlier this year published a damning report on the governance of the food-to-funerals group following a \u00a32.5bn annual loss, welcomed Saturday's historic vote, and insisted that the commitment to reform must not falter. \"It's a serious step forward and I am pleased to see a progressive solution was backed. But it is only part of the journey. The key thing now is to respect the principles that underlie my report. In particular the Co-op needs to create a board that is on par with the board's major competitors,\" said Myners, who was formerly a government minister and chairman of the Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian. \"This is not about ticking boxes, it's about the spirit in which they approach executive appointments. It has to be done in an open and transparent way but not good if decisions are made in the equivalent of an old smoke-filled room.\" The big question now is: can the Co-op recruit the kind of top executives such as a retiring chief executive of a Unilever or other major company?\" His warning comes just ahead of this week's interim financial figures which will show a major improvement in the position of the Co-op group which has just sold off its farm and pharmaceutical assets to raise cash. Myners' comments follow speculation inside some parts of the Co-op movement that Richard Pennycook, the current group finance director and Ben Reid, a former group board member who is chief executive of Midcounties Co-operative, are being lined up to win the chief executive and chairman jobs. Pennycook joined the 150-year-old Co-op from Morrisons supermarket while Reid previously offered to take on the chief executive post at the Co-op group after the resignation of the chief executive, Euan Sutherland, earlier this year. A spokesman for the mutual insisted that no decisions had yet been made and both the new chairman and chief executive would be chosen purely on the basis of talent. \"We are searching for the best candidate \u2026 the chairman will be completely independent,\" he explained. The reforming vote took place at a specially convened general meeting in Manchester at which 83% of votes were cast in favour of a resolution, proposed by the board and backed by the executive team. Among other measures this reduced the size of the ruling Co-op board from 20 to 11 persons but it left in place three seats to be filled by those elected by the wider Co-op membership. Myners wanted the whole board to be filled with businessmen and women who could bring relevant experience as part of a wider bid to make sure the Co-op was run more like a traditional company. In his 180-page review of the Co-op issued in May, Labour's City minister during the banking crisis, described a \"dysfunctional\" board in which some directors did not know the difference between debits and credits and \"clearly out of their depth when financial concepts and terminology are used\". The old board was made of 15 lay members including an engineer, a plasterer and a retired head teacher. Myners expressed astonishment that a group with 8 million members and 100,000 staff at the time could have run up debts of \u00a31.4bn and reported such high annual losses. He believed the recent sale of its 774 pharmacies to Bestway for \u00a3620m and its 15 farms to the Welcome Trust health charity for \u00a3250m had been good transactions which relieved the concerns of banks lending money to the Co-op. But the former government minister said the retail arm of the Co-op \u2013 number five behind Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Morrisons, was under \"serious pressure\" and only protecting its already comparatively low profit margins by losing market share. \"There is still a lot to be done but it would be churlish to express anything other than pleasure for the progress so far.\"",

      "bodyText": "Alexander Temerko, a leading oil industrialist in Britain, has launched a stinging attack on BP, accusing it of abandoning its lead role in the North Sea in favour of championing the interests of Russia. With the European Union threatening new sanctions on Russian, the director of Newcastle-based offshore engineering and construction group, OGN, says the British-based oil company has lost interest in its home base since taking a 20% interest in Kremlin-controlled Rosneft. \"BP used to be a strong voice for the North Sea but now it is very, very soft. The only time you really hear the voice of BP is when it is warning about sanctions being imposed on Russia,\" said Temerko. \"BP was a champion of North Sea investment but it has gradually sold off many of its assets to foreign companies such as Apache and Talisman while putting its money into Russia with Rosneft. You should call it Russian Petroleum not British Petroleum.\" Temerko is himself a former Russian national and was deputy chairman of Yukos, the now-dismantled Russian oil company established by oligarch and political dissident, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. He fought a successful court battle to stop being extradited back to Russia on what he claimed was trumped up fraud charges and has since established himself as a top British industrialist and Tory donor. Former shareholders in Yukos have recently won $50bn (\u00a330.1bn) in damages from the Russian government after an international court in the Hague ruled the officials under President Vladimir Putin deliberately set out to bankrupt and nationalise the business. The assets have largely ended up in the hands of Rosneft, and there have been threats that the British company might be sued by those same former Yukos shareholders. BP admitted it had sold off many local assets but said it was untrue that it was abandoning the North Sea. In fact it was one of four key global locations where it was concentrating its spending. \"We are investing in new developments in the UK. BP and our partners expect to invest more than \u00a37 billion in the North Sea over the next five years. We're also still looking for new opportunities.

He pointed out Trevor Garlick, one of its executives was a co-chair of the Oil &amp; Gas UK lobby group while Bob Dudley its chief executive's personal views on Scottish independence had been widely quoted. In February, Dudley said he did not want to see Scotland \"drifting away\" from the UK. Temerko denies he is motivated by feelings of anger against BP over the Yukos affair and still criticises the British oil company over what he argues has been its low profile in the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence. The former Yukos executive points out that BP's UK production has fallen from 330,000 barrels a day 10 years ago to just over 60,000 while its gas output has dwindled from 1.1 trillion cubic feet per day to 157m. In comparison BP now obtains from Russia nearly 840,000 barrels of oil a day and 800m cubic feet a day of gas. The OGN executive believes BP's new commitment to Moscow, through becoming a 20% shareholder in state-owned Rosneft in 2012, was a dangerous move as it opens up the London-based company to reputational and financial risk. He said: \"Rosneft is not transparent.

      "bodyText": "But for what he calls \"super luck\", Stephen Hicks could easily have found himself lugging plasma TV screens up the staircases of apartment buildings. As it turned out, the Australian scientist, who was in need of money in 2007, landed a job that was the first step in the creation of elaborate \"smart glasses\". The claim for the smart glasses is that they have the potential of giving those with sight loss the chance to recognise everyday objects and people again. The glasses use a combination of cameras to sense objects such as tables and walls as well as people, and then process that information into bright light on a screen. The person with impaired sight can use what is left of their vision to understand what is in front of them and navigate their surroundings. Hicks and his colleagues in Oxford recently won a \u00a3500,000 grant to expand the project and they will now create 100 pairs of the glasses to test on people with sight loss, in their homes. They aim to bring smart glasses to market at the end of next year. It is the culmination of a life interest in neuroscience for Hicks, who was led back to his passion for investigating how technology and the brain can work together when researching Huntington's disease about seven years ago. The latest prototype of his work uses two cameras and a laser to identify objects and then relay that information to a computer, which displays the objects on the glasses in very simplified form \u2013 detailed bright shapes. Users can see the objects using their residual vision, which typically is limited to perceptions of light and motion. In effect, the wearer sees a reduced version of the world without colour, where objects that are closer are much brighter. When people, bus stops and cars are further away they get darker. When he began the research, Hicks found that most people classified as blind still had some vision. \"I didn't realise that blindness was this continuum. In hindsight of course it is, it is the same as deafness: you can get people who are profoundly deaf, but the majority of people who are using hearing aids really just need it amplified. Things don't fall off, they fade away.\" The technology is aimed at allowing those with partial sight to navigate around the environment with much greater ease. In one of the early tests, a man was able to see his guide dog for the first time. \"A guy had seen his guide dog and said, 'there you are, girl'. Then we saw the power of what this could potentially mean to someone when it becomes more generally used,\" said Hicks. Some light perception is needed; the glasses can be calibrated to sensitivity. \"Nearby things are going to get brighter so put your hand in front and wave it and you will be able to see it. You will be able to build up hand-eye coordination. You will be able to walk around unfamiliar environments, especially at nighttime and get a good idea about obstacles \u2013 where gutters are, where overhanging branches are \u2013 giving you that confidence to walk down unfamiliar streets and be able to avoid bollards and buggies.\" Lyn Oliver, 70, from Faringdon, Oxfordshire, has joined the trials. She says she can see bone structures from almost two metres away, as well as ceiling beams and doorways. She became unable to read print in 1970 and started using a guide dog three years later. \"It will be less stress,\" she said. \"Because I live in a market town there is walking into hedges and low branches and things parked over the path. It will make a lot of difference to a lot of people and give them that little bit of normality, the confidence of walking out.\" Giving that renewed sense of confidence to people with limited sight is a key benefit, according to Hicks. He quotes figures from the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) which revealed that less than half of people who were severely sight-impaired tended to leave their home on any one day because of the dangers of running into objects. The RNIB has been working with Hicks and Oxford University to develop the glasses. \"We are excited about the potential these glasses have to improve the way blind and partially sighted people go about their everyday lives \u2013 walking down busy streets, visiting the shops, watching out for obstacles \u2013 simple tasks like this could be made much easier,\" said the RNIB's Neil Heslop. The glasses have got smaller since initial tests involved augmented ski goggles with banks of screens, but they are still chunky and pronounced. The makers aim to slim them down further until they are as unobtrusive as possible, with the potential of retrofitting normal glasses with the technology. The \u00a3500,000 for the project came from the Google Impact Challenge, a scheme to fund charities using technology to aid people. The 100 pairs of the glasses being developed will be tested at home by 1,000 people. A spinoff company owned by the RNIB, Oxford University and the device creators is planned to commercialise the invention. Hicks aims to have the first sets of glasses for sale by the end of next year, priced at \u00a3300-\u00a3400, but said they would not immediately eradicate the need for aids such as white sticks, which alert people to the fact that someone is visually impaired. \"It is more important for me to have lots of these in people's hands rather than a few for people who can afford it. If you can do mobile phones for that kind of price, I don't see why we can't replicate that with our own commercial approach,\" he said. Blindness in Britain There are more than two million people in the UK with impaired vision and 300,000 people are registered blind, according to the RNIB. While the glasses will not replace lost vision, it is claimed that they will help with spatial awareness, giving people who previously may not have had the confidence to navigate everyday tasks to venture out more often.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is a quarter of a century since the Berlin Wall came down. The cold war was eventually won by superior western economic power and a new era began once the communist regime collapsed in the Soviet Union and the two halves of Germany were reunited. For the first time in 25 years, the west is seriously worried about Russia. Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said at the weekend his country was \"close to a point of no return \u2013 full-scale war\". Russia faces the threat of tougher economic sanctions from the US and the European Union unless it withdraws its troops from eastern Ukraine. Economic warfare has the potential to damage Russia just as it did in the 1980s. Indeed, sanctions are hurting the economy, making it more expensive to refinance loans and almost impossible to attract the foreign capital needed to modernise Russia's energy sector. Growth has slowed to a standstill and the country will soon be in what could be a deep and prolonged recession. If this of concern to Vladimir Putin, he has yet to show it. With the eurozone itself teetering on the brink of a fresh downturn, the Russian leader believes that in a war of sanctions between a west that is barely out of recession and a Russia accustomed to belt-tightening, it will be the west that blinks first. Whether he is right or not, one thing is clear: the era that began with the opening of the iron curtain is over. Consider what happened when the Soviet Union collapsed. Instead of two great powers, there was now just one: the US. Instead of two competing ideologies, there was just: capitalism. \"We know what works\", said the then US president, George Bush, \"the free market works\". The next decade was the heyday for Bush's vision. Capitalism spread to parts of the world where it had previously been partially or totally off limits: China, India, and Russia. The dollar entrenched its position as the global currency. The Federal Reserve in Washington became the world's central bank. The completion of the seven-year Uruguay Round of trade talks saw tariffs reduced and markets opened up. A supra-national body, the World Trade Organisation, was set up in Geneva to act as the global trade policeman and to facilitate further liberalisation. Russia was subjected to shock treatment that saw economy shrink by 40% by the end of the 1990s. Male life expectancy plummeted. Privatisation delivered what had been seen as state-owned assets into the hands of oligarchs who got enormously rich. The poverty rate soared. In the west, the demise of the Soviet Union was felt in two ways. The obvious impact was that the end of the cold war delivered a hefty peace dividend. It was no longer necessary to spend as much money on defence, and governments were able to recycle part of the budget spent on combatting the perceived threat of the red army on tax cuts or other domestic spending priorities. The UK today spends 2.3% of national output on defence: at the end of the 1980s it spent 4% of GDP. Over time, though, it also became apparent that the existence of rival ideology had helped to smooth some of the rough edges of capitalism. Once the Soviet Union was no more, capitalism could show itself in its true colours, red in tooth and claw. For a few years, this was not immediately apparent as the flood of cheap goods from the new emerging markets meant low inflation and allowed western central banks to keep interest rates at levels low enough to generate booms in house prices. But once a model based around cheap credit and excessive borrowing hit the rocks, it also became clear that the new unencumbered variant of capitalism also meant outsourced jobs, falling living standards and welfare cuts. None of this has been popular, which is why so many governments have been kicked out since the financial crisis began. Politicians have got the message. They have come to the conclusion that in a tougher climate it is really a case of looking after your own interests no matter what the costs for everybody else. So, to take one example, for the unipolar world to work properly the Fed has to take seriously its responsibility as the global central bank. That means taking care that policies such as quantitative easing and the eventual normalisation of US monetary policy is conducted in a way that is sensitive to other countries. Yet Fed policy is being conducted solely with American interests in mind. If quantitative easing leads to a surge of hot money into emerging market economies and the end of QE leads to it surging out again, then that's too bad. QE has also been used as a way of trying to secure a competitive advantage. Central banks achieve this by electronically printing more money. One of the basic laws of economics is that the price of something goes down if the supply goes up. Increasing the money supply leads to a fall in the value of a currency, making a country's exports cheaper. So, when the Japanese, for example, announced that they were adopting policies designed to drive down the value of the yen, this was the equivalent of announcing that it was slapping a tariff on foreign goods. This is the equivalent of the competitive devaluations seen in the 1930s, only in a more subtle form. Free trade has also been a casualty. After 12 years of negotiations, the WTO finally thought it had clinched a modest deal in Bali in late 2013. This involved cutting trade red tape, making customs procedures more efficient and rooting out some of the more egregious examples of corruption. It was, in truth, the least the WTO could deliver while retaining its credibility. In late July, the deal was scuppered by India. Unless New Delhi has a change of heart, the Bali deal is dead, leaving the WTO a broken-backed organisation. This is a world in retreat from multilateralism.

      "body": "<p>It is a quarter of a century since the Berlin Wall came down. The cold war was eventually won by superior western economic power and a new era began once the communist regime collapsed in the Soviet Union and the two halves of Germany were reunited.</p> <p>For the first time in 25 years, the west is seriously worried about Russia. Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said at the weekend his country was \"close to a point of no return \u2013 full-scale war\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/31/eu-threatens-russia-unspecified-new-sanctions-ukraine\" title=\"\">Russia faces the threat of tougher economic sanctions from the US and the European Union</a> unless it withdraws its troops from eastern Ukraine.</p> <p>Economic warfare has the potential to damage Russia just as it did in the 1980s. Indeed, sanctions are hurting the economy, making it more expensive to refinance loans and almost impossible to attract the foreign capital needed to modernise Russia's energy sector. Growth has slowed to a standstill and the country will soon be in <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-28/russian-recession-risk-seen-at-record-high-amid-sanctions.html\" title=\"\">what could be a deep and prolonged recession</a>.</p> <p>If this of concern to Vladimir Putin, he has yet to show it. With the eurozone itself teetering on the brink of a fresh downturn, the Russian leader believes that in a war of sanctions between a west that is barely out of recession and a Russia accustomed to belt-tightening, it will be the west that blinks first. Whether he is right or not, one thing is clear: the era that began with the opening of the iron curtain is over.</p> <p>Consider what happened when the Soviet Union collapsed. Instead of two great powers, there was now just one: the US. Instead of two competing ideologies, there was just: capitalism. \"We know what works\", said the then US president, George Bush, \"the free market works\".</p> <p>The next decade was the heyday for Bush's vision. Capitalism spread to parts of the world where it had previously been partially or totally off limits: China, India, and Russia. The dollar entrenched its position as the global currency. The Federal Reserve in Washington became the world's central bank.</p> <p>The completion of the seven-year Uruguay Round of trade talks saw tariffs reduced and markets opened up. A supra-national body, the World Trade Organisation, was set up in Geneva to act as the global trade policeman and to facilitate further liberalisation.</p> <p>Russia was subjected to shock treatment that saw economy shrink by 40% by the end of the 1990s. Male life expectancy plummeted. Privatisation delivered what had been seen as state-owned assets into the hands of oligarchs who got enormously rich. The poverty rate soared.</p> <p>In the west, the demise of the Soviet Union was felt in two ways. The obvious impact was that the end of the cold war delivered a hefty peace dividend. It was no longer necessary to spend as much money on defence, and governments were able to recycle part of the budget spent on combatting the perceived threat of the red army on tax cuts or other domestic spending priorities.</p> <p>The UK today spends 2.3% of national output on defence: at the end of the 1980s it spent 4% of GDP. Over time, though, it also became apparent that the existence of rival ideology had helped to smooth some of the rough edges of capitalism. Once the Soviet Union was no more, capitalism could show itself in its true colours, red in tooth and claw. For a few years, this was not immediately apparent as the flood of cheap goods from the new emerging markets meant low inflation and allowed western central banks to keep interest rates at levels low enough to generate booms in house prices.</p> <p>But once a model based around cheap credit and excessive borrowing hit the rocks, it also became clear that the new unencumbered variant of capitalism also meant outsourced jobs, falling living standards and welfare cuts. None of this has been popular, which is why so many governments have been kicked out since the financial crisis began.</p> <p>Politicians have got the message. They have come to the conclusion that in a tougher climate it is really a case of looking after your own interests no matter what the costs for everybody else. So, to take one example, for the unipolar world to work properly the Fed has to take seriously its responsibility as the global central bank. That means taking care that policies such as quantitative easing and the eventual normalisation of US monetary policy is conducted in a way that is sensitive to other countries. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/09/fed-qe-stimulus-program-october\" title=\"\">Yet Fed policy is being conducted solely with American interests in mind</a>. If quantitative easing leads to a surge of hot money into emerging market economies and the end of QE leads to it surging out again, then that's too bad.</p> <p>QE has also been used as a way of trying to secure a competitive advantage. Central banks achieve this by electronically printing more money. One of the basic laws of economics is that the price of something goes down if the supply goes up. Increasing the money supply leads to a fall in the value of a currency, making a country's exports cheaper. So, when the Japanese, for example, announced that they were adopting policies designed to drive down the value of the yen, this was the equivalent of announcing that it was slapping a tariff on foreign goods. This is the equivalent of the competitive devaluations seen in the 1930s, only in a more subtle form.</p> <p>Free trade has also been a casualty. After 12 years of negotiations, the WTO finally thought it had clinched a modest deal in Bali in late 2013. This involved cutting trade red tape, making customs procedures more efficient and rooting out some of the more egregious examples of corruption. It was, in truth, the least the WTO could deliver while retaining its credibility. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/wto-future-doubt-india-blocks-deal\" title=\"\">In late July, the deal was scuppered by India</a>. Unless New Delhi has a change of heart, the Bali deal is dead, leaving the WTO a broken-backed organisation. This is a world in retreat from multilateralism.</p> <p>Although Putin has no alternative ideology to offer, times have changed. This is now a messier, less clearly defined, multipolar world. It is not just that the pre-eminence of the dollar has been challenged by Russia's announcement that roubles and yuan will be used in the oil deal it has brokered with China.

It is that after the convulsions of the past seven years, it is hard to imagine a US president or indeed any western leader saying: \"We know what works, the free market works.\"</p> <p>So RIP new world order.

      "bodyText": "In many markets, customers pay fees in return for a service, although it usually takes the City to charge for a disservice. We have seen numerous examples of investment banks billing their clients for a financial wringing \u2013 but that risk has always existed elsewhere. Take independent financial advisers (IFAs) who recommend to normal savers where to stash their cash. On making an investment, the saver would pay an annual fee to the company running their investment, and that company would then hand some of that money back to the adviser as a \"thank you\". It is simple to see how this arrangement might present IFAs with the temptation to recommend funds delivering the highest commissions, rather than investor returns. Anyway, some regulator finally got around to understanding this and has put a stop to it. The upshot \u2013 the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) \u2013 bans middlemen from taking fees for selling products for fund managers, so you now pay your adviser for, er, advice. Which brings us to Hargreaves Lansdown, the respected investment adviser, which is reporting full year results this week. The City is anxiously watching for an indication as to how its customers have reacted to the new transparent charges, which should mean an adviser's livelihood is dependent on competence. Many in the City fear the theory could catch on. Super advice from Investec How the City works, part 1,862. In January, analysts at Investec Securities published research on SuperGroup, the fashion chain behind the SuperDry brand, recommending punters buy the shares at \u00a315.56 each \u2013 according to the website Digital Look, which monitors these things. It did the same in February when the price had ticked up to \u00a316, again in May when the shares had slumped by around a quarter to \u00a311.79, and then (wait for it) tried again in June when the price hit \u00a38.70. If you think this is bordering on compulsive, brace yourself. Investec advised buying SuperGroup again in late June (at \u00a310.68) and had another stab last week when the price was \u00a311.50. The shares closed on Friday at \u00a310.91 and you'll be flabbergasted to learn that small print attached to these efforts contains this disclaimer: \"Investec has received compensation from the company for investment banking services in the past 12 months.\" Anyway, SuperGroup gets the chance to puff the business all by itself this week when it unveils first-quarter results. Like-for-like trading will be negative \u2013 although expect somebody to find plenty of positives. Betting on a Labour win Gambling loves to portray itself as a fun industry, and in many ways it can be. But at the moment the sector is on dreary form, moping around waiting for things to happen. At least one major firm (probably two) is looking for a new chief executive, while William Hill's new boss is just bedding in. Meanwhile, every bookie is desperately searching for what might become the next major technology innovation: only they appear to have no more clue as to where to place their bets than a once- yearly punter on Grand National day. Still, most paralysing of all seems to be the fear spreading across the sector about what might happen after next year's general election. Labour has proposed that betting levies should be extended to cover all sports (not just horse racing, as is currently the case) in order to fund grassroots sport. Analysts at brokers Davy reckon this \"could be very material indeed\" and will alarm an industry that is already \"reeling from substantial tax increases\". Much of this (though not the executive search) is relevant to Betfair's AGM and results. Yet boss Breon Corcoran, who seems to be doing a decent job, is being done few favours by his own website in the runup: it currently has Labour odds-on to be the largest party in May.",

      "body": "<p>In many markets, customers pay fees in return for a service, although it usually takes the City to charge for a disservice.</p> <p>We have seen numerous examples of investment banks billing their clients for a financial wringing \u2013 but that risk has always existed elsewhere.</p> <p>Take independent financial advisers (IFAs) who recommend to normal savers where to stash their cash. On making an investment, the saver would pay an annual fee to the company running their investment, and that company would then hand some of that money back to the adviser as a \"thank you\". It is simple to see how this arrangement might present IFAs with the temptation to recommend funds delivering the highest commissions, rather than investor returns.</p> <p>Anyway, some regulator finally got around to understanding this and has put a stop to it. The upshot \u2013 the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) \u2013 bans middlemen from taking fees for selling products for fund managers, so you now pay your adviser for, er, advice.</p> <p>Which brings us to Hargreaves Lansdown, the respected investment adviser, which is reporting full year results this week. The City is anxiously watching for an indication as to how its customers have reacted to the new transparent charges, which should mean an adviser's livelihood is dependent on competence. Many in the City fear the theory could catch on.</p> <h2>Super advice from Investec<br></h2> <p>How the City works, part 1,862.</p> <p>In January, analysts at Investec Securities published research on SuperGroup, the fashion chain behind the SuperDry brand, recommending punters buy the shares at \u00a315.56 each \u2013 according to the website Digital Look, which monitors these things.</p> <p>It did the same in February when the price had ticked up to \u00a316, again in May when the shares had slumped by around a quarter to \u00a311.79, and then (wait for it) tried again in June when the price hit \u00a38.70.</p> <p>If you think this is bordering on compulsive, brace yourself. Investec advised buying SuperGroup again in late June (at \u00a310.68) and had another stab last week when the price was \u00a311.50. The shares closed on Friday at \u00a310.91 and you'll be flabbergasted to learn that small print attached to these efforts contains this disclaimer: \"Investec has received compensation from the company for investment banking services in the past 12 months.\"</p> <p>Anyway, SuperGroup gets the chance to puff the business all by itself this week when it unveils first-quarter results. Like-for-like trading will be negative \u2013 although expect somebody to find plenty of positives.</p> <h2>Betting on a Labour win<br></h2> <p>Gambling loves to portray itself as a fun industry, and in many ways it can be.
