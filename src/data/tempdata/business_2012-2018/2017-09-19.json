      "bodyText": "Yoko Ono Lennon has stepped in to rescue the name of her husband from fizzy pop reinvention, taking legal action to halt the sale of a lemonade called John Lemon. The Polish company which sells the beverage, set up five years ago, has agreed to change its name to On Lemon after legal letters were sent by Ono Lennon\u2019s lawyers to the parent company and its distributors across Europe. It must sell up its stocks of its John Lemon drinks by the end of October. The family business, which distributes to bars and restaurants in the UK and 13 other European countries, says it did not try to use the image of Lennon to boost its business. Karol Chamera, founder of Mr Lemonade Alternative Drinks, the UK distributor of John Lemon which is based in Bow, London, told the East London Advertiser: \u201cAll of us involved with this product are startups and we couldn\u2019t take on someone who is worth many, many millions.\u201d Ono Lennon\u2019s lawyers said the lemonade infringed the trademark of her late husband\u2019s name and his personal rights. They claimed damages in the range of \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,400) a day and \u20ac500 for every bottle sold and asked the court in The Hague, the Netherlands, to determine damages. Joris Van Manen, of Dutch law firm Hoyng Rokh Monegier, which acted for Ono Lennon, told the East London Advertiser: \u201cThey were abusing and misusing the legacy of John Lennon to sell their soda.\u201d The legal action referenced a Facebook post by John Lemon Ireland showing a large wall mural of Lennon holding lemons with the brand\u2019s logo underneath. Other advertising depicted a pair of round glasses, closely linked with the famous Beatle, next to the words \u201cLet It Be.\u201d Hugo Ba\u0142azi\u0144ski of law firm KSP, which acted for John Lemon, said the company had registered its trademark in 2014 and that the John Lennon brand was not registered until last year. He said his client had concluded a settlement to avoid the risk of banning production of its lemonade. He said: \u201cThe settlement allowed our client to continue his business and passion in one, however it was agreed that since November 2017 the products offered by our client should rebrand.\u201d Alex Brodie, a partner at the law firm Gowling WLG, said: \u201cUK law doesn\u2019t provide for image rights as such but passing off and claims for false endorsement do succeed as can cases based on registered trade marks. \u201cFor example, earlier this year BrewDog used the brand \u2018Elvis Juice IPA\u2019 for one of their products only to fail in a case brought by the Elvis estate for trademark infringement.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2017. The sub-heading of an earlier version referred to legal letters saying \u201cdrink infringed copyright\u201d. That should have said \u201cinfringed trademark\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The operators of Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square have censored the content of an anti-Adani slideshow presented there, demanding that all images of newspaper headlines and politicians, as well as \u201cexplicitly negative\u201d environmental messages be removed. On Saturday, a coalition of environmental groups held a screening of the documentary Guarding the Galilee at Federation Square, attended by about 300 people. The film is about the fight to stop Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine, which would be the biggest coalmine ever built in Australia and one of the biggest in the world. In the week before the event, Federation Square demanded to see the slideshow that would be presented before the screening and then demanded much of it be removed. In email correspondence a Federation Square representative told the event organisers they \u201ccannot permit any slides with protest messaging, slogans or memes together with slides that show pictures of politicians, newspaper headlines or any explicitly political messaging\u201d. The operators objected to any content that was \u201cnegative and inflammatory\u201d and demanded the majority of the slides be removed or significantly altered. That included removing all pictures of newspaper headlines, politicians, political memes, protests or pictures of the Great Barrier Reef with \u201cinflammatory messaging\u201d. Federation square also demanded that the \u201cstop Adani\u201d logo be changed to black and white, and that it not take up a whole slide. \u201cI would recommend putting together a slideshow that focuses more on the environmental aspect of the reef without the protest messaging,\u201d the Federation Square representative said. Federation Square is managed by Fed Square Pty Ltd and owned by the state government of Victoria. The demands surprised the organisers, since Federation Square had approved the screening of the Guarding the Galilee, which included footage of protests, criticisms of the federal government, images of politicians presented in a negative light as well as explicit protest messaging. As part of the agreement for hiring the venue, the organisers were told the material must be \u201cG or PG rated\u201d and the written agreement stated: \u201cThe hirer understands that Fed Square reserves the right to reject material that is deemed unacceptable or inappropriate for public exhibition in terms of quality, format type or content.\u201d Federation Square had told the organisers over the phone that \u201cpolitically partisan\u201d slides would not be allowed but the organisers said they were told that related to messaging related to political parties. When challenged by the organisers over email, Federation Square said: \u201cAlthough not associated specifically with a political party, the content is certainly political in nature and partisan in its opposition/protest to the current governments and their policies.\u201d In order to ensure the meeting went ahead, the organisers removed more than half the slides. Odette Joannidis, a Stop Adani volunteer and co-organiser of the event, said the debacle revealed Federation Square was not \u201ca friend of the people\u201d. \u201cThe management had us over a barrel, threatening to pull the plug on our event unless we obeyed their crazy request to cut the most benign of images from being shown,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like being in an Orwellian nightmare, not Melbourne. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that in 2017, in an era of climate change, executives at Fed Square would actively censor photos of mums, dads and grandparents engaged in peaceful actions and suggest they were \u2018inflammatory\u2019 images.\u201d Because Federation Square refused to tell the organisers exactly which slides were causing the problem, and discussion was occurring just days before the event, the organisers removed anything they thought might be considered partisan, negative or inflammatory. \u201cWe asked for guidance from Fed Square on a slide-by-slide basis so we could better understand what exactly it was they objected to,\u201d said Pablo Brait from Market Forces, who also organised the event. \u201cHowever, Fed Square refused to give us this guidance and instead issued an ultimatum that the next version of the slideshow had to be acceptable to them, or else there would be no slideshow at all.\u201d Federation Square refused to answer a series of questions from the Guardian asking which sort of material was and wasn\u2019t allowed and why. Instead, a spokeswoman sent through the following statement. Fed Square was delighted to approve the screening of an important environmental documentary, Guarding the Galilee. The event organiser subsequently requested to present a large PowerPoint presentation, which Fed Square did not approve. Fed Square\u2019s venue hire agreement states that Fed Square can refuse the right to play or remove from display any screen content considered offensive or inappropriate for any reason whatsoever. This was communicated to the event organiser and a mutual agreement was reached. The event was organised by groups including Bayside Climate Change Action Group, StopAdani Eltham, Crochet for Coral not Coal, Darebin Climate Action Now, GetUp Melbourne East, AYCC Victoria, Melbourne Ports Stop Adani Group and Market Forces. The groups crowdfunded the event and major sponsors included the National Tertiary Education Union and Melbourne builders Jenkinson Building.",

    "webTitle": "Why were HBOS auditors cleared? We need a full explanation | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In its annual report and accounts for the year ending 31 December 2007, HBOS reported a profit before tax of \u00a35.5bn. Those accounts were issued in February 2008. Eight months later, the bank was bust. HBOS was the second biggest failure in the British banking history. When the accounts for 2008 were published they showed a thumping loss of \u00a311bn, including an impairment charge of \u00a312bn. As the official report into the collapse noted dryly: \u201cThe deterioration in the quality of HBOS\u2019s loan book, and the speed with which it all happened, are a notable part of the HBOS story.\u201d It was therefore not surprising that parliament \u2013 like everybody else \u2013 wanted a good explanation of what the auditors, KPMG, were thinking when they deemed HBOS to be a going concern in February 2008. It was a question for the Financial Reporting Council. And here it is, the FRC\u2019s definitive judgment: KPMG did nothing wrong. HBOS had not expected market conditions to deteriorate and thought it would be able to fund itself. KPMG considered and accepted that view. The auditor\u2019s assessment was not unreasonable \u201cat the time\u201d. That, more or less, is the entirety of the FRC\u2019s brief summary on its investigation. Hold on, though, didn\u2019t the FRC, under pressure from Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee in the last parliament, promise a full report on the auditing on HBOS? Well, yes, it did. Tyrie announced the fact in March last year and published the supporting letter from Stephen Haddrill, head of the FRC. It stated: \u201cWe will publish a full report drawn from all our work in relation to HBOS and bank auditing.\u201d A report will still follow next month, says the FRC, but its description of the contents is now more watery. The glaring omission in Tuesday\u2019s version was a specific mention of HBOS. Instead, the FRC plans to talk about its actions \u201cin audit and corporate reporting developments since the financial crisis, including on the audits of banks\u201d. One fears HBOS will get lost in a wash of generalities. The FRC\u2019s decision to close its investigation into KPMG may be entirely fair and proper but a full explanation is still required. Tyrie, when he was on the warfare over HBOS, accused the FRC of lacking \u201ccuriosity and diligence\u201d. Nicky Morgan, his successor, needs to take a similarly robust approach.

Yet the changes could almost have been written to address Polman\u2019s stinging criticisms. One of his complaints was about the UK\u2019s shortened bid timetables. A mere 28 days, he argued, is not long enough for defending companies to audit cost-savings that might help the case for independence. On that front, the target company will be able to demand that a bidder pauses for 14 days between announcing a plan to bid and actually tabling the offer that starts the clock. That seems sensible.

The effort to oblige bidders to set out details of how they propose to run a company is also welcome.

Well, yes, it did. Tyrie announced the fact in March last year and published the supporting letter from Stephen Haddrill, head of the FRC. It stated: \u201cWe will publish a full report drawn from all our work in relation to HBOS and bank auditing.\u201d</p> <p>A report will still follow next month, says the FRC, but its description of the contents is now more watery. The glaring omission in Tuesday\u2019s version was a specific mention of HBOS. Instead, the FRC plans to talk about its actions \u201cin audit and corporate reporting developments since the financial crisis, including on the audits of banks\u201d. One fears HBOS will get lost in a wash of generalities.</p> <p>The FRC\u2019s decision to close its investigation into KPMG may be entirely fair and proper but a full explanation is still required. Tyrie, when he was on the warfare over HBOS, accused the FRC of lacking \u201ccuriosity and diligence\u201d. Nicky Morgan, his successor, needs to take a similarly robust approach.

    "webTitle": "Ryanair offers pilots \u00a312,000 bonus to tackle cancelled flights fiasco", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair has offered pilots a one-off bonus of up to \u00a312,000 to forfeit holidays, according to a memo seen by the Guardian, as it battles to prevent further flight cancellations caused by a \u201cmess-up\u201d in its rota system. The Irish airline\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, apologised this week after saying that up to 50 flights a day would be cancelled until 31 October, affecting about 400,000 passengers. Ryanair is now facing fury from customers who fear they will be left out of pocket and has also been warned by the Civil Aviation Authority that it could face penalties for refusing to reroute passengers with rival airlines. It is also fending off allegations from the Irish pilots\u2019 union that it is making European regulations a scapegoat, rather than acknowledging its own failure to allocate enough pilots for its schedule. Ryanair could face further disruption from industrial action amid reports that pilots were meeting in Dublin and across Europe to discuss the possibility of going on strike. Internal emails seen by the Guardian show that the no-frills airline is scrambling to appease pilots and first officers by offering tax-free bonuses not to take time off. \u201cTo avoid further cancellations, we are requesting between one and two blocks of five days from every pilot who has already been assigned their month off,\u201d Ryanair\u2019s chief operations officer, Michael Hickey, told pilots. \u201cIn recognition of the impact on you of the need to fly additional days I am implementing the following bonus scheme. All current pilots [...] who remain operating Ryanair aircraft between Sept and 31st October 2018 will receive a once-off \u20ac12,000/\u00a312,000 gross bonus for captains and \u20ac6,000/\u00a36,000 for first officers in November 2018.\u201d Pilots will not receive the one-off bonus until November next year, an inducement to stay with the company amid reports that many are defecting to Norwegian, which said it had hired 140 pilots from the Irish airline since the start of the year. Ryanair does not disclose salaries, but captains and first officers were offered basic wages of \u20ac62,500 and \u20ac21,000 respectively in 2015, according to a report in the Irish Times. Pilots and first officers will get the bonus provided they have flown more than 800 hours for Ryanair in the year to 31 October 2018, and complete at least 10 days off during the period, including a block of five days in a row. Ryanair said it would also increase the overnight payments that pilots get for working away from their base airport, while staff would also be entitled to normal rates for working days off. Passengers told the Guardian of poor communication from Ryanair that has forced them to miss family events and has left them in fear of financial hardship if they cannot recoup costs such as hotel rooms and replacement flights. Christa, from Brighton, was waiting at Budapest airport for her flight home on Tuesday, a day after she was due to return to the UK. \u201cI received a text message from Ryanair on Friday 15 September about Monday\u2019s flight,\u201d she said. \u201cI phoned them twice and received poor customer service. The staff member was not apologetic for what happened and gave me no reason for the cancellation.\u201d Ryanair has also cancelled flights to Lisbon, leading to anxiety among Manchester United fans who have already bought tickets for their team\u2019s Champions League tie with Benfica on 18 October. Leslie Lee, a TV producer living in London, was told by text on the morning of her flight that it had been cancelled, and said she was hundreds of pounds out of pocket after booking an alternative flight with British Airways. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve been offered a partial refund for the unused flight, which cost \u00a370, the cancellation has set me back about \u00a3500 and I\u2019m worried that Ryanair won\u2019t compensate me,\u201d she said. O\u2019Leary said on Monday that Ryanair would not \u201cpay for flights on our competitors\u201d, despite EU regulations that it must offer the option if a rival\u2019s flight leaves \u201csignificantly sooner\u201d than its own. A spokesperson for the CAA said: \u201c\u201cRyanair is well aware of these passenger rights and we have sought assurances from the airline on how and when they will provide alternative flights with other airlines.\u201d The spokesperson added that Ryanair would face \u201cenforcement action\u201d if it does not comply. Ryanair has blamed the cancellations on a change in the way Irish airlines interpret European regulations that limit pilots\u2019 flying hours to 900 per calendar year for safety reasons. Airlines regulated by the Irish Aviation Authority have until this year been alone in interpreting the calendar year as running from April to March. This gave the likes of Ryanair an advantage over continental rivals, because it could schedule more flights during the busy summer months, benching pilots in quieter periods. The Irish pilots\u2019 union (IALPA) said Ryanair could not blame the change because \u201cthey had at least two seasons\u2019 notice of the new regulations in which to put their house in order. IALPA added: \u201cA separate point of note is Ryanair saying that the problem will last for about six weeks. This conveniently brings them to the winter schedule with its reduced overall crewing requirement, which is further evidence of the real problem being a shortage of flight crew.\u201d The union says more than 700 pilots have left Ryanair this year. Asked about its memo to staff Ryanair, which employs 4,200 pilots, said it did not comment on \u201crumour or speculation\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "More than half of young women have to borrow to make their cash last to the end of the month, highlighting the impact of stagnating wages, insecure work and rising prices on millennials. A survey of 4,000 people aged 18-30 shows that 51% of young women and 45% of young men regularly use credit to stretch their finances until payday. The report also found that a quarter of young people in the UK are constantly in debt. When asked how young people made their cash last to the end of the month, one in five said they used their overdraft and a similar number borrowed from family. The next most popular form of borrowing by people in the age group was using a credit card. One in 10 said they had used a payday loan company, although for parents aged under 30, this number increased to one in four. The Young Women\u2019s Trust, which commissioned the representative sample of young people, said many of those questioned in the survey also worked extra hours or skipped meals to make their cash stretch to the end of the month. The results follow a series of reports by debt charities showing a rise in the number of people seeking help with personal debts and arrears on household bills. The debt charity StepChange said it was concerned about a steep increase in the number of under-40s and renters who were struggling to make ends meet, adding to the trend for low-income families to rely on credit to buy essential items. The Young Women\u2019s Trust, which began 150 years ago as the Young Women\u2019s Christian Association (YWCA) and was renamed in 2013, provides services for women aged 16-30 \u201ctrapped by low or no pay and facing a life of poverty\u201d. The charity\u2019s chief executive, Carole Easton, said: \u201cYoung people tell us they want to work hard and be financially independent but as prices rise and wages remain low, more and more are struggling. \u201cYoung women are more likely to be stuck on low pay and on zero-hours contracts, which mean they don\u2019t know how many hours they will work each month and whether they will earn enough to pay their bills. \u201cIt can be particularly hard for young mums; in many cases, low pay means an hour\u2019s childcare can cost more than an hour\u2019s wages. As a result, many are failing to make ends meet and are falling into debt,\u201d she added. Easton, a former chief executive of ChildLine, said 25% of young people believed their level of debt had got worse in the past year and 61% expect to be still in debt when they are aged 40. She warned that left young people with \u201clittle hope for the future\u201d, especially as the Bank of England has hinted in recent days that it is likely to raise interest rates in the near future. \u201cThe worry is many young people will be pushed further into debt,\u201d she said. \u201cMuch more needs to be done to improve young people\u2019s prospects. This means giving them the right skills and support to find jobs, ensuring decent and flexible jobs are available, and paying a proper living wage that doesn\u2019t discriminate against age. This would benefit businesses and the economy too.\u201d The Young Women\u2019s Trust will publish its full survey in a new report, Worrying Times, at the end of September.",

      "bodyText": "Workers at three Cadbury plants have won an inflation-linked pay deal for the next two years, bringing employees relief from the squeeze on British households amid the rising cost of living. About 1,300 staff at sites in Bournville in the West Midlands \u2013 the historical home of the chocolate maker \u2013 Chirk, near Wrexham in Wales, and Marlbrook in Herefordshire, voted in favour of the pay deal, according to the Unite union. It said the two-year deal was designed to counter rising inflation, and also includes an increase in maternity pay. Workers will receive a backdated pay rise for April 2017 to March 2018 of 3.2%, which was the level of the retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation in February. The pay deal for 2018-19 will be based on the RPI in February next year. British households have come under increasing pressure from soaring inflation this year, sparked by the drop in the pound following the Brexit vote. The fall in sterling \u2013 of more than 9% \u2013 has pushed up the cost of imported goods, while average wage growth has failed to keep pace. The Cadbury pay increase is significant as it is pegged to RPI, which is higher than the consumer price index (CPI), the official measure of inflation in the UK. CPI was 2.9% in July. The Bank of England expects the figure to peak above 3% next month, before falling next year. The deal also beats the average rate of pay growth. Average earnings increased by 2.1% in the three months to July, which the Office for National Statistics said was equal to a 0.4% real-terms cut in the value of pay packets once inflation is taken into account. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has suggested a sharp fall in migrant workers coming to Britain as a consequence of Brexit could push up wages and cause a spike in inflation in the short term. EU nationals may opt against coming to Britain due to real or potential restrictions, which could drive up the bargaining power of workers as the supply of available labour dissipates. As a consequence, Threadneedle Street has warned that the first rise in interest rates in a decade could come later this year to curb growing inflation. Cadbury also agreed to lengthen the period of maternity pay set at 65% of earnings from 12 weeks to seven and a half months. The deal is for the period following the initial six weeks of leave \u2013 paid at 90% of pay \u2013 required by law. The company produces chocolate crumb at Chirk and milk products at Marlbrook, before both plants send goods to Bournville to be made into chocolate bars. It is part of the US Mondelez food conglomerate once owned by Kraft, which employs about 4,000 staff across nine sites in the UK. A spokesman for the company said it was delighted to have reached an agreement with its workers: \u201cWhilst ensuring the business remains competitive, the deal rewards our respected colleagues across our three chocolate manufacturing sites in the UK.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "World markets are continuing their record runs, unperturbed by Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric against North Korea at the UN and despite some caution ahead of the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday. The MSCI All Country World Index, a broad measure of global shares, reached a new peak of 487.48, while the Nikkei closed just under 2% higher. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 both hit new peaks, while European shares managed to edge higher. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 21.97 points or 0.3% higher at 7275.25 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.02% to 12,561.79 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.16% to 5237.44 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.27% to 22,425.42 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.39% at 10,378.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.27% to 762.86 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.2% at 22,378, and on track for yet another record close. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The pound has had an uncertain day. Initially sterling slipped back in the wake of Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s comments on Monday that any rate rises would be gradual and limited. But a report that Boris Johnson could resign as foreign secretary before the weekend if his demands over Brexit were not met - although denied - saw the pound jump half a cent to $1.3535. But as the day progressed the currency drifted back from its best levels and is currently up just 0.01% at $1.3495. President Trump\u2019s speech to the UN had a few hair raising moments, including the threat that the US might have to \u201ctotally destroy North Korea.\u201d But markets seem to be fairly unmoved by this and all of Trump\u2019s other state of the world comments. Wall Street is off its best levels but still up around 16 points and close to its all time highs. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Wall Street opened this morning at a record high and, despite a few concerns over the contents of his speech, Donald Trump\u2019s maiden address to the United Nations hasn\u2019t upset the applecart too much. While the President continued his hard-line stance on North Korea, the threat of war seems less likely than it did a couple of weeks ago. More importantly for traders, Trump again reiterated his desire to again put America first \u2013 continuing the run of confidence in the US market. The next big milestone for traders is the Fed meeting tomorrow to discuss raising interest rates. While a hike doesn\u2019t seem on the cards until December, any indication that that might be brought forward could see the bullishness of the markets quickly shaken off. The outlook for global growth is positive, says ratings agency Fitch, but this could be tempered by the withdrawal of central banks\u2019 stimulus measure. In its latest global credit outlook report, Fitch says: Global rating outlooks remain on an improving trend and are on balance less negative that at the start of the year across most rating sectors.... However the improving outlook for global credit quality is underpinned by years of loose central bank monetary policy, including quantitative easing, as well as what are now the strongest world growth conditions since 2010. \u201cLooking ahead in the rating cycle, the most benign credit market conditions in modern history will gradually begin to normalise as central bank assistance is withdrawn and world growth peaks in 2018. This could begin to temper the otherwise upbeat rating outlook trend,\u201d said Monica Insoll, managing director in Fitch\u2019s credit market research team. Unwinding QE will pose challenges to both borrowers and lenders, including the many sovereigns with post-2000 high government debt-to-GDP levels. With a number of markets appearing to be approaching cyclical peaks, it may also expose potential asset bubbles, including those in buoyant housing markets such as Australia, Canada and some Nordic countries. The US Federal Reserve has already begun raising interest rates and at this week\u2019s meeting, it is expected to set out plans to unwind its balance sheet and begin selling bonds bought as part of QE. The European Central Bank is also likely to set out plans to move away from QE before too long, while the Bank of England has recently been hinting at the prospect of a rate rise as early as November. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s decision from the US Federal Reserve on interest rates and the future of its monetary policy, Wall Street has opened at yet new heights. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.15% at a record 22,366 while the S&amp;P has edged up 0.12% to a new high. Apart from the Fed meeting, the other main event exercising investors\u2019 minds is President Trump\u2019s speech at the United Nations. Some disappointing data from the US, just as the Federal Reserve deliberates on interest rates and monetary policy. The current account deficit - the difference between goods and services flowing into and out of the country - rose from $113.5bn in the first quarter to $123.1bn in the second three months of the year compared to expectations of a figure of $115.1bn. The first quarter figure was revised down from $116.8bn. Import prices jumped by 0.6% in August, up from 0.1% in the previous month, as the cost of petrol jumped and the dollar weakened. And housing starts fell for the second month in a row, down 0.8% in August. Following the Guardian\u2019s reports on the debt time bomb, with huge borrowings being racked up by Britain\u2019s most vulnerable consumers, there are calls for an independent inquiry. Phillip Inman and Jill Treanor write: The chairs of two powerful parliamentary committees have urged the government to set up an independent public inquiry into the \u00a3200bn of credit amassed by households, as Britain\u2019s debt crisis raises alarm among senior MPs. The call by Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business select committee, and Frank Field, the Labour head of the work and pensions select committee, comes as the Conservative-led Treasury select committee plans to hold meetings around the country to examine the impact of debt on individuals and households. \u201cDebt is a huge emotional burden for people,\u201d said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee. She added that \u201cunstable personal finances\u201d often emerged as problems raised by her constituents in Loughborough. The \u00a3200bn of debt amassed on credit cards, personal loans and car deals is now at the same levels it reached before the 2008 financial crisis and there are fears that rises in interest rates could put more households under pressure. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned on Monday that interest rates were likely to rise in response to rising inflation and skills shortages brought on by Brexit that will increase pressure on wages. Their full report is here: And here are more reports in our series: Sterling has edged higher following a report that Boris Johnson might resign by the weekend if the prime minister does not change her Brexit stance. It is now up 0.25% at $1.3526, after an initial dip. The Foreign Office has no immediate comment on the Telegraph story, and Johnson told the paper he will not resign. But the ripple in the market shows investors are nervous about the whole Brexit situation. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB, said: The rise in sterling since the news is modest compared to recent rallies but it shows nonetheless that the markets are closely watching the latest political developments with a keen eye. Recently economic data and monetary policy have usurped politics in driving the pound, but the latest news is a timely reminder that the political situation can quickly become front and centre once more after what has been, since the Brexit vote at least, a relatively prolonged period on the back-burner. European stock markets are hovering around six-week highs today, as the City awaits tomorrow\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is up around 0.2%, while Germany\u2019s DAX is down a smidgen. City economists are still expecting the Fed to leave US interest rates on hold, perhaps until December. The Fed will also probably outline how it will unwind its huge bond-buying programme. Jack Flaherty, investment director at asset manager GAM explains: The Fed finally looks set to announce the normalisation of its balance sheet and we think the necessary reinvestment tapering will begin in October. It is not likely to change its growth and employment forecasts significantly, though with inflation on the low side of expectations, some of the base line numbers may be adjusted downwards. A rate hike is still on the cards for this year, unless inflation comes in even further below target. I missed this earlier, but German investor confidence has bounced back in August. The ZEW Institute\u2019s monthly barometer of financial morale jumped to 17 this month, up from 10 back in August, and much higher than expected. ZEW president Achim Wambach credited: \u201c\u201cSolid growth in the second quarter, recent big increases in banks\u2019 lending business and growing investment from firms and the state\u201d. The survey also shows that German investors are concerned about Britain\u2019s economic prospects: In other news, a new survey has shown that Europe\u2019s builders cracked on in July. Construction sector production in the EU rose by 0.5% per month in July, and by 0.2% in the eurozone, Eurostat reports. It was driven by an increase in building production (such as building new houses), while civil engineering output dropped. That suggests that construction will provide a positive impact on European growth over the summer, says Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macro. Over the last year, Europe\u2019s construction output has risen by 3.6%. Britain, though, is lagging behind, as the uncertainty created by Brexit weighs on the economy. Eurostat says: Among Member States for which data are available, the highest increases in production in construction were recorded in Hungary (+22.6%), Sweden (+21.2%), Poland (+19.8%) and Slovakia (+14.7%). Decreases were observed in the United Kingdom (-1.1%) and Italy (-0.4%). Zero-hours contracts are a particular issue for young workers. One third of people on \u201czero-hours contracts\u201d are aged 16 to 24, compared with 11.4% for all people in employment. Dr Carole Easton OBE, chief executive of the Young Women\u2019s Trust, says this creates insecurity and financial problems for young people, leading to anxiety and mental health issues. Dr Easton explains: Budgeting, paying your bills and planning ahead can be impossible when you don\u2019t know how many hours you will be working or how much money you will have coming in each month. For some, an inability to balance precarious shifts with childcare can make working impossible. Here\u2019s Richard Partington\u2019s news story on today\u2019s data: The storm of controversy over zero-hours contracts in recent years has forced some employers to ditch them. Instead, people are being hired on contracts that only guarantee a small number of hours each week - which can then be increased as needed. Alan Price, employment law director at Peninsula (a HR and employment law firm), explains: Zero hours contracts have received mass negative publicity regarding their use and the unfair treatment of staff working under these contracts. Large companies, such as McDonalds, have been seeking a move away from these contracts by giving staff the opportunity to request a contract with guaranteed hours, calculated as an average of the hours worked under their previous zero hours contracts. It is likely many other companies are recruiting on similar contracts containing a small number of guaranteed hours and then requesting staff to work extra hours as and when to meet business demands. Moving away from the name \u2018zero hours contracts\u2019 removes the negative connotations associated with these contracts and improves public perception of the company. It can also make recruitment easier by defining available positions as flexible and guaranteed hours, rather than zero hours. On average, someone on a \u201czero-hours contract\u201d usually works 26 hours a week, today\u2019s report shows. They\u2019re also more likely to be female. The ONS says: People on \u201czero-hours contracts\u201d are more likely to be young, part-time, women or in full-time education when compared with other people in employment. The TUC have welcomed the drop in zero-hours contracts, but also wants more action. General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201c1.4 million zero-hour contracts is 1.4 million too many. \u201cWhile it\u2019s good that some employers have ditched them as a result of union campaigning, let\u2019s not pretend that life at the sharp end has become easier overnight. \u201cOne in ten UK workers remain in insecure jobs. The spread of low-paid self-employment, agency work and short-hours contracts mean millions are struggling to get by The Labour Party says the drop in zero-hours contracts isn\u2019t enough - it wants them banned altogether. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, says all workers deserve to have guaranteed hours: \u201cIt is a national scandal that there are 1.4 million contracts that don\u2019t guarantee minimum hours, with people stuck in limbo in insecure work, not knowing how much they\u2019ll earn from week to week, unable to budget for basic necessities and unsure if they can even pay the rent. The Government urgently needs to get a grip on the broken labour market which is rigged against workers and adopt Labour\u2019s policy to ban zero hour contracts.\u201d This chart from today\u2019s report shows how the number of people on zero-hours contracts appears to have peaked.... ..this chart shows that administration, food, accommodation and healthcare companies use them the most... ..and crucially, this charts shows that people on zero-hours contracts are more likely to want more work than other workers. The number of people on zero hours contracts has fallen to its lowest level since 2014, suggesting demand for these contracts may have peaked. A new report from the Office for National Statistics shows that there were 1.4 million contracts which didn\u2019t guarantee any actual work, down from 1.7m a year earlier. In addition, the number of people working these contracts fell to 883,000 in the three months to June, a drop of 20,000 (as we reported last month). This could be a significant moment, following criticism of the way that some companies use zero-hours contracts. Senior ONS statistician David Freeman says: In May this year there were 1.4m employment contracts in use that didn\u2019t guarantee minimum hours, down from a peak of 2.1m two years previously. Coupled with figures we\u2019ve already seen from the Labour Force Survey showing a small fall in the number of people who say they\u2019re on zero-hours contracts, it seems possible that the trend towards this type of work has begun to unwind. More to follow.... It\u2019s a dark morning for Toys R Us. The world\u2019s biggest toy retailer has been forced to seek bankruptcy protection this morning, in an attempt to tackle its $5bn debt mountain. Analysts are blaming the move towards online shopping and electronic gadgets, which means fewer families trek to their local toy store for a new board game, ball or bike. Back in the 90s, every child with a working TV would regularly be told about the delights of Toys R US; a \u201cmagical place\u2019 with millions of toys all under one roof. Happy memories.... There are plenty of issues for investors to watch closely this week, from interest rate decisions to Hurricane Maria as it heads towards the British Virgin Islands. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, explains: With President Trump expected to talk tough on North Korea and Iran during his first U.N. speech today, investors will be keeping a close eye on any repercussions further out. That we also have two Central Bank meetings [in America and Japan] and the all-important Brexit speech from Theresa May to come this week, means economic data is likely to be less pressing for investors. There are mixed feelings over the FOMC meeting too, despite high expectations of balance sheet reduction. Investors are aware that Trump has the potential to change the make-up of the Fed over the coming months, which could potentially pour cold water on any plans unveiled this week. So investors are likely bracing themselves for potential political risk around a central bank which is meant to be politically independent. Britain\u2019s accountancy watchdog has ended its probe into KPMG over its auditing of HBOS, the bank which failed during the financial crisis almost a decade ago. The Financial Reporting Council has concluded there isn\u2019t a realistic prospect that a Tribunal would make an Adverse Finding against KPMG. KPMG had been criticised for signing off HBOS\u2019s accounts in early 2008, just eight months before the bank had to be rescued by Lloyds. Subsequently, HBOS was heavily criticised for its reckless lending policies, which led to billions of toxic loans which sank the bank when the economy weakened. The FRC has concluded that KPMG\u2019s work \u201cdid not fall significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of the audit\u201d. The FRC explains. In early 2008 HBOS concluded that its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 should be prepared on a \u201cgoing concern\u201d basis. HBOSdid not expect market conditions to worsen and judged that it would be able to fund itself. The auditor considered and accepted this conclusion. HBOS published its audited financial statements in February 2008 on that basis. The evidence of market conditions at that time did not show this decision of HBOS or the auditor\u2019s assessment of it to be unreasonable at the time. KPMG has insisted that it challenged HBOS over its optimistic assumptions, and pushed the bank\u2019s top management to take larger provisions against bad loans (not large enough, though, it turned out) The pound is rallying this morning, after Bank of England governor Mark Carney dropped another hint that interest rates will rise soon. Sterling is up 0.3% against both the euro at \u20ac1.199, and the dollar at $1.354. Yesterday, Carney told an audience in Washington DC that \u201csome withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months\u201d. That makes it even more likely that the BoE will act in November. Although, as economist Sean Richards tweets, Carney has talked the talk before, but not delivered... MSCI\u2019s All Country World Index, a broad measure of global shares, has hit a new record today. It struck 486.95 for the first time, thanks to the Nikkei\u2019s rally and last night\u2019s Wall Street action. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are nudging new all-time highs todays, as the bull market shows no signs of running out of puff. Last night, America\u2019s man stocks closed at new records, again, as investors prepared for Wednesday\u2019s meeting of the Federal Reserve. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones ended at new highs, driven by financial stocks. The rally comes ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Fed meeting, where the US central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged as it plots a path to unwind its stimulus measures without upsetting the markets. Japan has now joined the rally too. After Monday\u2019s holiday, the Nikkei surged by almost 2% today. Easing geopolitical worries are pulling down the yen (which is good for Japanese exports and will be welcomed in Tokyo). Speculation that Japanese prime minister Abe might be planning to call a snap election also boosted confidence (not that snap elections always go as planned...). Abe\u2019s popularity has risen in recent months, so he could strengthen his grip on parliament. Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities, says: \u201cInvestors were worried about \u2018Abexit\u2019 before, but if he calls a snap election and his ruling party wins, it would strengthen the foundations of his once-weak government base.\u201d [No, I\u2019m not sure about Abexit either...] European markets are expected to cling onto yesterday\u2019s six week highs. CMC Market\u2019s Michael Hewson explains that investors around the globe are waiting to see what the Fed announces, and says, tomorrow: US stock markets also continued where they left off on Friday posting new record highs as investors geared up for tomorrows Federal Reserve rate meeting and press conference, with the US central bank expected to embark on the first baby steps on the paring down of its balance sheet. Despite recent poor US economic data there still seems to be a belief amongst some in the markets that we could see one more rate hike this year, something that may well be borne out by tomorrow\u2019s rate dot plot projections. Whether the projections survive their exposure to the real world of the hurricane clear up of Harvey and Irma is another matter, not to mention the prospect of further hurricanes with the latest in the form of Maria as it moves towards Puerto Rico. The latest geopolitical situation appears to have settled down for now but with President Trump set to speak at the United Nations later today it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise if North Korea decided to send him a message so to speak, perhaps in the form of another missile test. While the rhetoric appears to have settled down a touch it probably wouldn\u2019t take much to set it all off again. Here\u2019s our liveblog on Hurricane Maria, which has just battered Dominica: Traders will also be watching the latest eurozone economic data, to see if Europe\u2019s recover remains on track. Here\u2019s the agenda: 10am BST: Eurozone construction output in July. It was stagnant in June, so a recovery would be welcome. 10am BST: ZEW survey of eurozone confidence. It is expected to improve slightly to 12.3, after sliding to just 10 in August. 1.30pm BST: US housing starts. Economists predict that 1.7% more housebuilding projects began in August, after a drop of 4.8% in July",

In its latest global credit outlook report, Fitch says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Global rating outlooks remain on an improving trend and are on balance less negative that at the start of the year across most rating sectors....</p> <p>However the improving outlook for global credit quality is underpinned by years of loose central bank monetary policy, including quantitative easing, as well as what are now the strongest world growth conditions since 2010.</p> <p>\u201cLooking ahead in the rating cycle, the most benign credit market conditions in modern history will gradually begin to normalise as central bank assistance is withdrawn and world growth peaks in 2018. This could begin to temper the otherwise upbeat rating outlook trend,\u201d said Monica Insoll, managing director in Fitch\u2019s credit market research team.</p> <p>Unwinding QE will pose challenges to both borrowers and lenders, including the many sovereigns with post-2000 high government debt-to-GDP levels. With a number of markets appearing to be approaching cyclical peaks, it may also expose potential asset bubbles, including those in buoyant housing markets such as Australia, Canada and some Nordic countries.</p> </blockquote> <p>The US Federal Reserve has already begun raising interest rates and at this week\u2019s meeting, it is expected to set out plans to unwind its balance sheet and begin selling bonds bought as part of QE.

Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said XL\u2019s decision was \u201ca strong endorsement of Ireland\u2019s outward focus and of our commitment to embrace new business opportunities\u201d. XL is the second Lloyd\u2019s of London insurer to announce EU operations would be headquartered in Dublin after the July announcement that Beazley would convert its Dublin operation to a business transacting throughout the EU. This week a Reuters survey found that about 10,000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain if the UK is denied access to Europe\u2019s single market. The findings suggested that the first wave of job losses would be lower than previous predictions, which suggested that as many as 100,000 jobs would be lost as a result of Brexit. It is thought that initially fewer than 100 XL posts will be created in Dublin, where the Bermuda-registered company has operated since 1990. The Irish minister for business, enterprise and innovation, Frances Fitzgerald, said on Tuesday it was making \u201cstrenuous efforts to ensure the right conditions\u201d were created in Ireland for continued investment across the financial services sector. \u201cAs we face into the challenges of Brexit, we are determined to pursue and seize new opportunities,\u201d she said. XL got a large slice of the London market when in 2015 it bought Lloyd\u2019s of London insurer Catlin Group for \u00a32.8bn. While Frankfurt has emerged as the big winner on the banking front with Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Nomura opting for the German city, the insurance sector is split with a three-way battle between Dublin, Luxembourg and Paris. Two weeks ago US insurer Chubb announced it was planning to put its EU headquarters in the French capital if the UK quit Europe; AIG, another American company, said in March it would set up a subsidiary in Luxembourg.",

      "bodyText": "The billionaire businessman Jim Ratcliffe has warned that it would only be possible to build a successor to the Land Rover Defender in the UK, creating up to 10,000 new jobs, if the project receives government backing. The founder and chairman of the chemicals firm Ineos said Britain was the \u201cnumber one\u201d choice to invest about \u00a3600m in a new 4x4 off-road vehicle that could fill the gap in the market left by the Defender, which Jaguar Land Rover stopped making in 2016. He added that while Ineos was having \u201cpositive\u201d conversations with the UK government, options included a number of other countries, such as Germany, where skills and facilities were more readily available. \u201cIt would be quite a challenge to do it in the UK without a subsidy because there are facilities and trained workforces [elsewhere], so in the UK we get higher risk and higher costs. At the end of the day it has to be a profitable venture.\u201d Ineos said it would make a decision on where to build the 4x4 off-roader within the next nine to 12 months, with the first vehicles rolling off the production line in 2020-21 and priced from about \u00a335,000. Volumes are expected to reach 25,000 vehicles within three years, and it would be available in diesel, petrol and hybrid versions. About 1,000 jobs would be created directly, the company said, with another 5,000 to 10,000 created indirectly among car part suppliers and other service providers. If it did opt for the UK, a new factory would be located somewhere along Britain\u2019s east coast, possibly Grangemouth in Scotland or Hull, where Ineos already operates. Ratcliffe said a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d blow had been dealt to the UK manufacturing industry over the past two decades, with its contribution to the UK economy falling from 23% in 1990s to less than 10% today. \u201cWe are not afraid of manufacturing challenges and I think the UK does need a few manufacturing challenges. In an ideal world we would like to build it in the UK, which is obviously its heritage. But it has to make economic sense and we have had a surprising amount of interest from the continent using existing facilities. You would have to build a new facility in the UK. \u201cWorkers\u2019 skills are a challenge in the UK \u2013 not an insurmountable challenge \u2013 but you would need to train a complete workforce in the UK. Nissan have done it and Toyota have done it in Derby but if you go to places like Germany, you\u2019ve got a trained workforce.\u201d He said the aim was to build a more reliable, \u201cunbreakable\u201d version of the Defender, whose famous owners included the Queen. \u201cIt was the world\u2019s most famous car. It conquered the planet in many ways,\u201d Ratcliffe said of the Defender. \u201cIt was the world\u2019s best off-road vehicle \u2013 not the most reliable \u2013 and we lamented its demise two years ago when Jaguar Land Rover said it was stopping production. It\u2019s 67 years old but it still looks cool today. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a little bit arrogant for a chemical company to think it can produce a world-class 4x4 but we have the confidence that we can manufacture things. We\u2019re very prevalent in Germany. We have a lot of German engineers and a great respect for German engineering. I think there will be a step change in the quality of this vehicle.\u201d Jaguar Land Rover is already working on an updated version of the Defender and a spokesman for the company said the original design had been registered in many countries, with a trademark application currently under way in Britain. He added: \u201cWe fully believe we have proprietary rights on this vehicle. It is one of the most recognisable shapes on the road.\u201d Ineos has yet to produce a specific design or name for its version of the car, nicknamed \u201cProjekt Grenadier\u201d after the London pub in which the idea was conceived. Ratcliffe said he was confident the demand would be there for the new 4x4, which he described as \u201can honest\u201d vehicle which would appeal to farmers and adventurers alike. Key target markets initially would be the UK, mainland Europe and the US.",

The German chains are outpacing their bigger rivals as inflation and stagnating wages eat into families\u2019 spare cash, prompting many to seek ways of saving money. The discounters are also rapidly opening new stores while traditional supermarkets have closed outlets amid the growing popularity of internet shopping. Ocado, the online supermarket, notched up a 14.3% rise in sales to \u00a3344.5m in the three months to 27 August. The company\u2019s share price slid 1.6% as it revealed that growth was accompanied by the rising cost of building infrastructure to deliver its goods while the average size of customer orders had slipped back. Lidl was the UK\u2019s fastest growing grocery chain in the three months to 10 September. Its sales increased 19.2%, taking its market share to a new high of 5.3%, according to the latest figures from Kantar Worldpanel. It achieved strong sales of fresh and chilled goods including dairy, white and ros\u00e9 wine. Despite the strong growth, seasonal fluctuations in trade mean it is back on a par with Waitrose, where sales rose 2.4%, after overtaking the chain last month. Aldi\u2019s sales gained 15.6%, taking its market share to 6.9%. The grocer has widened its lead on the Co-op, where sales fell for the second month in a row after it sold 300 small stores to McColl\u2019s. In the past three months, almost 63% of shoppers visited one of the discounters, up from 58.5% last year. Their market share has risen to 12.2%, a surge from less than 10% only two years ago. All the large grocery chains are benefiting as food price inflation, which emerged in January after more than two years of price falls, remains above 3%. Prices rose 3.2% in the period, partly as a result of the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote. The volume of goods sold also rose, increasing total market sales by 3.6%. It is the sixth consecutive month in which sales have risen by more than 3%, with all four of the large supermarket chains \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 reporting an increase in business. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen sustained market growth of this kind since May 2013.\u201d The growth came despite disappointing August weather, which hit sales of traditional summer foods. Prepared salad fell 6%; scotch eggs and suncare products were down 16%. However, shoppers spent almost \u00a34m on cold and flu remedies in August \u2013 an increase of almost \u00a32m on the same month last year. Tighter budgets have also spurred consumers to buy fewer big brands. Spending on supermarket own-label products such as Tesco Finest and Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference rose 5.5% year on year in the three months to 9 September, according to analysts at Nielsen.",

Spending on supermarket own-label products such as Tesco Finest and Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference rose 5.5% year on year in the three months to 9 September, according to analysts at Nielsen.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Ryanair to tell 400,000 passengers of cancelled flights after roster 'mess-up'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair has written to 400,000 passengers to tell them that their flight has been cancelled after it admitted to a \u201cmess-up\u201d on pilot rostering that left 18 million ticket holders wondering if their holiday plans would be ruined. In a hastily arranged press conference in Dublin on Monday afternoon amid a passenger revolt and a slump in the company\u2019s share price, the normally combative chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d for \u201ca mess of our own making\u201d. O\u2019Leary blamed a one-off holiday pilot rostering issue, which if not tackled immediately would send the airline\u2019s on-time punctuality below 50%, adding that it will cost Ryanair about \u20ac25m (\u00a322m) in compensation payouts and other costs. But in a flash of the arrogance for which he is better known, O\u2019Leary said that travellers vowing never to fly Ryanair again will almost certainly return to the airline because its prices are lower. \u201cOur booking engine is full of passengers who have sworn they will never fly with us again,\u201d he said. Ryanair will cancel 40 to 50 flights every day until 31 October, with the airline promising to focus the cuts on routes where alternative flights are more easily available. For example, it will cancel one flight a day on its Stansted to Dublin route, which operates 12 a day. O\u2019Leary said customers whose flights have been cancelled would receive an email by Monday evening. He said that 75% to 80% of passengers will be re-routed free of charge within a day of their expected departure date, and that compensation of \u20ac240 to \u20ac400 (\u00a3212 to \u00a3354) will be paid, depending on the length of the journey. But that will leave as many as 100,000 ticket holders seriously delayed, with possible weekend getaways wrecked. O\u2019Leary said consequential losses, caused when travellers cancel hire cars or hotels, will not be covered by Ryanair. He added that the airline will not book passengers on to rival airlines to get them to their destination on time. \u201cWe will not pay for flights on other airlines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot afford to pay the high costs of our competitors.\u201d But he admitted the way Ryanair issued its first cancellation warning on Friday had unnecessarily left millions of travellers in the dark. \u201cWe did not focus on the concern we were causing to the 18 million passengers flying with us over the next six weeks,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cI say sorry to them.\u201d Many Ryanair customers took to Twitter to express their disgust over how Ryanair was handling passengers who could not know if they were to be cancelled. One user said she feared for her wedding, with 30 Ryanair flights booked for her party, while others said that even if their outbound flight was not cancelled they could not be sure if their inbound flight would be. Initially, Ryanair was making available only lists of cancelled flights up to Wednesday 20 September. Ryanair rejected allegations that the real reason for the cancellations is a shortage of pilots. There have been claims that Ryanair has been haemorrhaging pilots to rival airlines. Norwegian, which is building a new hub in Ryanair\u2019s home airport, Dublin, said: \u201cWe can confirm that 140 pilots have joined Norwegian from Ryanair this year. Pilot recruitment is also under way for more pilots for our new Dublin base opening later this year.\u201d O\u2019Leary disputed Norwegian\u2019s figures - but admitted that Ryanair has begun offering pilots at captain level a \u20ac10,000 \u201csigning-on bonus\u201d to join. He also struggled to explain why Ryanair was not aware earlier of rostering problems ahead. \u201cThere were some overoptimistic briefings coming from rostering,\u201d he said. He rejected any suggestion he should resign. \u201cThis is clearly a mess-up,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut it is my mess-up, and a mess I have to clear up.\u201d Shares in the airline fell by 3% in early trading, knocking more than \u00a3500m off its \u00a318bn stock market valuation, although losses were pared back later in the day. O\u2019Leary said he expected to face a compensation bill of \u20ac20m plus \u20ac5m in operational costs. Analysts at Dublin-based Goodbody Stockbrokers said the final bill was likely to be \u20ac34.5m as they marked down Ryanair\u2019s full-year profit forecast by 2.3%. Investor groups said that while Ryanair usually brushes off poor publicity, in this case it could seriously hit the airline. \u201cRyanair is notorious for not caring about what sort of headlines they get, working on the basis that all publicity is good publicity \u2013 but not this time,\u201d said Rebecca O\u2019Keefe of Interactive Investor. \u201cPreviously, the carrier was happy to suggest that you get what you pay for and despite negative press lots of flyers embraced the fact that they knew the score and were happy to fly without the frills. \u201cHowever, the current situation is truly damaging, with flyers left high and dry with last-minute cancellations or apprehensive that they might be affected.\u201d O\u2019Keefe said it was unclear whether the delays were caused by poor planning or a shortage of pilots. \u201cIf the former, then it suggests some truly poor processes. If the latter, then we may see wages rise to fill the gaps. Either way, it\u2019s not good news for Ryanair.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Toys R Us has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada after running up $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debts and struggling to compete in the age of internet shopping. The world\u2019s largest toy store chain said it had filed for Chapter 11 to restructure its debts and work out a sustainable path for its finances that would allow it to invest in long-term growth. The New Jersey-based company, which employs 64,000, said the vast majority of its 1,600 stores around the world were profitable, adding that its businesses outside North America, including the UK, were not affected. The group\u2019s history dates to the 1950s in the US. It arrived in the UK, where it employs more than 2,500 people, in 1985. It has 110 stores in Britain as well as a website launched in 1996. The group confirmed it was opening further shops in the UK, with four planned before Christmas in High Wycombe, Sunderland, Blackburn and Craigleith in Scotland. It is also revamping its flagship shops in Bristol and Brent Cross shopping centre in north London. \u201cToday marks the dawn of a new era at Toys R Us, where we expect that the financial constraints that have held us back will be addressed in a lasting and effective way,\u201d said Dave Brandon, the chairman and chief executive. \u201cTogether with our investors, our objective is to work with our debtholders and other creditors to restructure the $5bn of long-term debt on our balance sheet, which will provide us with greater financial flexibility to invest in our business, continue to improve the customer experience in our physical stores and online, and strengthen our competitive position in an increasingly challenging and rapidly changing retail marketplace worldwide.\u201d The 60-year-old company, which faces about $400m of debt repayments in 2018, said it had secured about $3bn of financing from various lenders, including a JP Morgan-led bank syndicate, to keep its stores open as usual as it approaches its key Christmas selling period. Brandon said: \u201cAs the holiday season ramps up, our physical and web stores are open for business, and our team members around the world look forward to continuing to put huge smiles on children\u2019s faces. We thank our vendors for their ongoing support through this important season and beyond.\u201d Analysts say the company\u2019s large network of shops are an expensive burden at a time when online giants Amazon and Walmart are discounting toys to steal their shoppers. \u201cThe demise of Toys R Us in North America will come as little surprise in an environment where bricks and mortar retail is continuing to struggle with high debt levels and the havoc being wreaked by e-commerce,\u201d said Jon Copestake, chief retail and consumer goods analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cToys R Us has proven to be particularly vulnerable to online competition which offers greater choice and convenience, often at a better price. \u201cThere is room in physical retail for toy stores as the queues outside Hamleys and Lego stores will testify but success is now more likely to come from stores that reinvent themselves as destinations offering experiences or as niche outlets for hardcore collectors. The \u2018pile them high\u2019 big box approach is simply no longer relevant.\u201d Toys R Us said that as part of its proceedings it had sought approval to continue paying staff wages and benefits, honour customer programmes, and pay suppliers as usual.",

      "bodyText": "The giant Anglo-Australian miner BHP has agreed to reconsider its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia, as well as other industry groups, and to clarify how BHP\u2019s position on climate and energy policy differs from those bodies. The move comes as BHP faces a shareholder resolution urging the company to terminate membership of bodies that demonstrate a pattern of advocacy on policy issues at odds with the company\u2019s positions since 2012. The resolution was moved by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility on behalf of more than 120 shareholders of BHP. \u201cThe last decade or longer of Australian climate and energy policy has been characterised by short-lived policy subject to relentless scrutiny and adversarial campaigning by industry bodies, or no policy at all,\u201d the ACCR said on behalf of about the shareholders in a supporting statement. The statement called for BHP to review membership of industry bodies, and singled out the Minerals Council of Australia, noting its activities have \u201cdiminished the federal government\u2019s ability to resolve a national policy issue of material relevance to our company and the stability of its operations\u201d. \u201cThe MCA\u2019s activities undermine the possibility of achieving what our company has stated an \u2018effective policy framework\u2019 should include: a complementary set of measures including a price on carbon, support for low-emissions technologies, energy efficiency and measures to build resilience,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOver time, these activities have the potential to undermine shareholder value, given our company\u2019s exposure to climate-related risk and energy instability.\u201d In 2016 AGL, Australia\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, left the MCA, citing material differences in their positions on climate change and energy. \u201cAGL\u2019s positions on climate change and renewable energy differed from those held by the Minerals Council of Australia and the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, and AGL has elected not to renew its membership of these organisations,\u201d the company said. In recent months BHP has expressed public displeasure at some of the MCA\u2019s lobbying activities. The CSIRO has come under fire for its membership of the MCA. In a statement uploaded to the BHP website on Monday, the miner said it would review its membership of industry bodies, specifically mentioning the Minerals Council of Australia. It also committed to publishing statements on how its positions differ from industry groups on climate change. \u201cIn the past, we have always sought to make our position on significant public issues clear,\u201d BHP said. \u201cHowever, we will further our efforts to ensure that material differences with industry associations on key issues are clearly understood. \u201cTo that end, we will make public, by 31 December 2017, a list of the material differences between the positions we hold on climate and energy policy, and the advocacy positions on climate and energy policy taken by industry associations to which we belong.\u201d",
