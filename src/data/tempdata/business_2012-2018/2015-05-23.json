      "bodyText": "US attorney general Loretta Lynch declared last week that five major banks had engaged in \u201cbrazenly illegal behaviour\u201d on a \u201cnear-daily basis\u201d in rigging foreign exchange markets. But no sooner had she imposed record \u00a32.6bn fines on the banks and extracted guilty pleas from four of them \u2013 including Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays \u2013 than she was facing questions about why no charges were brought against individuals. This is a familiar refrain ever since the 2008 banking crisis led to multibillion-pound bailouts. Some bankers have ended up behind bars: Iceland currently has four former bank bosses in jail, while in the US a few junior bankers have been convicted. Ireland convicted two former executives of Anglo Irish Bank, but did not jail them. However, to many, the list seems short when compared with the $235bn of fines that Reuters calculates have been imposed on 20 major banks in the past seven years for market rigging, sanctions busting, money laundering and mis-selling mortgage bonds in the runup to the 2008 crisis. Robert Jenkins, a former Bank of England policymaker, reels off a long list of reasons for the lack of action. Now a senior fellow at thinktank Better Markets, Jenkins reckons one reason regulators backed away from proceedings against individuals is fear, and says this dates back to 2002, when accountancy firm Arthur Andersen was convicted of destroying documents related to its audits of Enron. The prosecution was overturned in 2005, too late to save what had been one of the world\u2019s biggest accountants from collapse. There was, Jenkins said, \u201cfear by the US authorities of a banking version of Arthur Andersen at a time of financial fragility\u201d. But he lists other problems, from difficulties in proving criminal intent to lobbying by bankers and the naivete of regulators, who really thought they were dealing with a \u201cfew bad apples\u201d. Jenkins says there were also fears that a heavy crackdown would lead to banks draining credit from the economy. Mistakes were made from the outset of the crisis, he says. \u201cFrom the very beginning those on both sides of the table \u2013 bankers and policymakers \u2013have been behind the curve on what needed to be done, what could have been done, and what the public understood should have been done.\u201d In Iceland a special prosecutor, \u00d3lafur Hauksson, was appointed to look through the wreckage of Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir banks. He has prosecuted 60 individuals through 22 indictments and is often asked why other countries have not done the same. He says Iceland just got started rapidly: \u201cWe were more focused on those cases in the beginning and that meant we had to specialise in cases relating to financial institutions.\u201d Even now, seven years on, cases are still going through the courts. One, relating to the collapse of Kaupthing and involving nine individuals, ended only two days ago. Deciding on the correct charge is another problem. Hauksson is bringing charges for market manipulation, fraud, embezzlement and fraudulent loans. New UK laws should make prosecutions in the banking sector easier: a seven-year jail term for reckless misconduct was introduced, but prosecutors will have to prove that bankers knew their decisions would cause a bank to collapse. New offences for rigging a range of benchmarks came into effect this year but are not retrospective, so cannot be used against the traders whose actions prompted the latest vast fines. Last week Lynch, who is barely a month into her role, said she was \u201cnot able to comment on whether or not we will be bringing additional charges against individuals\u201d because the investigation into currency rigging was continuing. She pointed out that the US had charged 12 people for Libor-rigging offences. In the UK the Serious Fraud Office has charged 13 \u2013 its first trial starts on Tuesday \u2013 but they are all junior staff: no bank bosses have so far faced charges. Jimmy Gurul\u00e9, law professor at the US\u2019s University of Notre Dame and a former assistant attorney general, is hoping Lynch will take a tougher stance. She said at her confirmation hearing that \u201cno individual is too big to jail\u201d. Jenkins added the banks should also face the threat of being broken up: \u201cWhen it comes to the systematic wrongdoing on their watch, either the senior executives knew, did not know or cannot be expected to know. If they knew they are complicit. If they did not know they are incompetent. And if the banks are so large and complex that they cannot be expected to know, then they are a walking argument for breaking up the banks.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Globalisation is under attack. It was meant to be the unstoppable economic force bringing prosperity to rich and poor alike, but that was before the financial crisis ripped up the rulebook. For the past four years, international trade flows have increased more slowly than global GDP \u2013 \u201can outcome unprecedented in postwar history\u201d, as analyst Michael Pearce of Capital Economics put it in a recent note. Crisis-scarred global banks are retreating from risky cross-border lending, and multinationals are casting a sceptical eye over foreign opportunities as geopolitical tensions simmer. Populist politicians in a string of countries, not least the UK, are playing on public fears about migrant workers undermining their pay. Global trade flows are still expanding: but they have never regained the breakneck pace of the 1990s and early 2000s. In the innocent days before the Great Recession, the dismantling of trade barriers between nation states often seemed inevitable. Yet more than 13 years after the Doha round of multilateral trade talks kicked off, with the aim of binding developing countries more closely into the international system, the idea of a global trade deal remains locked in the deep freeze. Some analysts are starting to ask: has globalisation come to a halt? The lesson many governments and companies learned from the turmoil that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers was that there are risks to being too unthinkingly exposed to the ebbs and flows of the international system. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a fundamental shift going on here,\u201d says Professor Simon Evenett, an expert on trade at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland. \u201cYou can\u2019t say it\u2019s across the board, but there are some sectors where globalisation is in substantial retreat.\u201d He points to steel, for example, where his recent research shows that trade flows have never returned to pre-2007 levels. \u201cI think the direction of travel is depressing,\u201d he says. At the London G20 summit back in April 2009, when trade volumes were falling off a cliff, the fear was of a tit-for-tat protectionist battle breaking out. Seeking to avoid that disastrous outcome, world leaders publicly pledged in the conference communiqu\u00e9 that they would \u201cnot repeat the historic mistakes of protectionism of previous eras\u201d. But while governments have generally not resorted to blatant protectionist measures of the kind that characterised the interwar years \u2013 the notorious Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in the US, for example, which slapped import taxes on more than 20,000 types of foreign goods \u2013 Evenett says they have often used quieter ways of giving domestic firms an unfair advantage. They might offer credit guarantees or tax rebates for exporters, for example \u2013 or just throw government money behind export promotion. Evenett\u2019s recent work suggests that 90% of the exports from least-developed countries \u2013 the world\u2019s poorest \u2013 have to compete against \u201csome kind of subsidised rival\u201d. And where politicians are pushing for renewed trade liberalisation \u2013 in the transatlantic trade deal known as TTIP, for example \u2013 they are facing a powerful public campaign from consumers nervous that multinationals will be handed too much control. Other bulwarks against globalisation are also on the agenda, from the tougher curbs on the rights of migrants being promoted by David Cameron as part of his renegotiation with the European Union, to the capital controls \u2013 albeit temporary \u2013 imposed by Cyprus after it was bailed out to prevent money flooding abroad. A recent Bank of England research paper noted that banks were retreating from cross-border lending, which is now perceived as jeopardising financial stability. Ann Pettifor, of thinktank Prime Economics, says the impact of the financial crisis has led the public to feel they need protection from the ravages of the markets \u2013 an instinct described by the economist Karl Polanyi in the 1930s and 1940s. \u201cIt has made us more inward-looking and more nationalist,\u201d she says. \u201cPolanyi said what people were looking for was protection from the markets \u2013 from these forces that appear to be beyond our control.\u201d Pettifor argues that the resurgence of Scottish nationalism, rising support for the Front National in France, and the election of the radical Syriza government in Greece, can all ultimately be traced back to some version of this impulse. Professor Jagdish Bhagwati, an Indian-born economist now at Columbia University in the US and an avowed free trader, says part of globalisation\u2019s image problem comes from the assumption that it has to mean unleashing capital flows, which he calls \u201cthe weak underbelly of globalisation\u201d. \u201cThe freeing-up of capital flows is what led to the East Asian financial crisis [of the late 1990s], and we need to do something about that,\u201d he says. He argues that free capital flows are not a necessary part of globalisation. \u201cDid you expect me also to be for free love?\u201d he jokes. \u201cMaybe I am, but not because I\u2019m a free trader!\u201d Recent research by the International Monetary Fund, highlighted by its managing director Christine Lagarde, suggested that developing countries must be cautious about so-called \u201cfinancial deepening\u201d \u2013 expanding their banking sectors and opening up their capital markets \u2013 because without tough regulation it can be too risky. Inflows of speculative \u201chot money\u201d can pump up asset prices and lead to a borrowing binge by consumers and businesses \u2013 which quickly turns to bust when global investors change their minds and pull their money back home. Some analysts expect these dynamics to be on display when the Federal Reserve finally starts to push up US interest rates, which is likely to happen this year. And just as governments have not always been good at protecting their citizens from rapid inflows and outflows of foreign money, the failure to shield workers from foreign competition has also undermined faith in globalisation. \u201cOver the last 10 to 20 years, there has been an explosion of participation in the global economy of big, low-income countries: China, India, the former communist countries,\u201d says Fred Bergsten, senior fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who advises Barack Obama on trade policy. In effect, about a billion workers once focused predominantly on serving their domestic markets, or scraping a subsistence living, have joined the global workforce. That has been an extraordinary force for lifting people out of poverty; and as Bhagwati points out, it has been a boon for consumers in the west, who have feasted on imports of cut-price goods. But globalisation has also become a scapegoat for mass layoffs and stagnating wages among workers in some developed countries, as manufacturing jobs have been shifted offshore. That argument has been particularly powerful in America, where trade unions have fought against further trade liberalisation. \u201cI have always thought that the greatest threat to globalisation is the US,\u201d says Bergsten. He believes public scepticism has been fuelled by his country\u2019s lack of an effective social safety net \u2013 the limited support for workers who lose their jobs. \u201cThe US is a big winner from globalisation, but within that there are probably millions of losers, and they don\u2019t have anywhere to turn,\u201d he says. In Europe, it has been migration flows \u2013 a different aspect of global economic integration \u2013 that have caused controversy. Swati Dhingra, of the London School of Economics, insists there is little evidence that migration lowers domestic wages. \u201cIt has very little impact,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really one of the most misunderstood issues.\u201d But with median wages stagnating, the free movement of goods or of workers often gets the blame. However, despite public anxiety, Bergsten and Bhagwati both believe it is too soon to write off globalisation. While the Doha round is effectively dead, a clutch of new \u201cplurilateral\u201d trade deals between groups of countries are on the drawing board. President Obama repeatedly disappointed the hopes of his European partners and the World Trade Organisation that he would champion trade liberalisation earlier in his presidency. But he is now throwing his weight behind an effort to convince Congress to grant him \u201cfast track\u201d negotiating powers, in a bid to complete the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) with a group of powerful countries including Japan and Australia. \u201cHe\u2019s been a little bit subdued, but he\u2019s not going to want a protectionist legacy,\u201d says Bhagwati. The EU, meanwhile, is pushing its own deal with the US \u2013 the TTIP \u2013 and separate agreements, including with India, where Bhagwati believes the pro-market regime of Narendra Modi will be more sympathetic to lowering trade barriers than his predecessor. Trade experts warn that these cross-cutting plurilateral deals tend to exclude the poorest countries, which have little leverage in negotiations, and risk creating a \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d of complex rules and relationships. \u201cThe smaller developing countries are just never going to get the kind of deal they can get from multilateral negotiations,\u201d says Dhingra. And Obama has made it clear that a major rationale for the TPP is not promoting shared prosperity \u2013 the idealistic motivation that lay behind the birth of the Doha round \u2013 but creating a political and economic counterweight to the might of China. Bergsten, who is briefing Congress about the issue, says the traditional way to get trade agreements passed in the US is not to stress the economic benefits but allay fears about any harm. \u201cWe have to neutralise the economic arguments,\u201d he says, \u201cand then it gets carried across the finish line by foreign policy.\u201d Even if the latest crop of trade deals do not succeed in lowering trade barriers further, however, it may be too soon to read the last rites for globalisation. Pearce, of Capital Economics, points out that technological change could give trade a renewed boost, with increasingly fast internet connections facilitating the provision of more cross-border services, for example. But Pettifor argues that in the long term, politicians will only win public support for globalisation if they manage it better \u2014 and that means better social safety nets at home and controls on cross-border capital flows. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about capital mobility,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you manage capital flows, then trade won\u2019t be as free \u2013 but it will be more stable.\u201d",

It was meant to be the unstoppable economic force bringing prosperity to rich and poor alike, but that was before the financial crisis ripped up the rulebook.</p> <p>For the past four years, international trade flows have increased more slowly than global GDP \u2013 \u201can outcome unprecedented in postwar history\u201d, as analyst Michael Pearce of Capital Economics put it in a recent note.</p> <p>Crisis-scarred global banks are retreating from risky cross-border lending, and multinationals are casting a sceptical eye over foreign opportunities as geopolitical tensions simmer. Populist politicians in a string of countries, not least the UK, are playing on public fears about migrant workers undermining their pay.</p> <p>Global trade flows are still expanding: but they have never regained the breakneck pace of the 1990s and early 2000s.</p> <p>In the innocent days before the Great Recession, the dismantling of trade barriers between nation states often seemed inevitable. Yet more than 13 years after the Doha round of multilateral trade talks kicked off, with the aim of binding developing countries more closely into the international system, the idea of a global trade deal remains locked in the deep freeze. Some analysts are starting to ask: has globalisation come to a halt?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>I have always thought that the greatest threat to globalisation is the US</p> <footer> <cite>Fred Bergsten, economist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The lesson many governments and companies learned from the turmoil that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers was that there are risks to being too unthinkingly exposed to the ebbs and flows of the international system.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s quite a fundamental shift going on here,\u201d says Professor Simon Evenett, an expert on trade at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland. \u201cYou can\u2019t say it\u2019s across the board, but there are some sectors where globalisation is in substantial retreat.\u201d He points to steel, for example, where his recent research shows that trade flows have never returned to pre-2007 levels. \u201cI think the direction of travel is depressing,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the London G20 summit back in April 2009, when trade volumes were falling off a cliff, the fear was of a tit-for-tat protectionist battle breaking out. Seeking to avoid that disastrous outcome, world leaders publicly pledged in the conference communiqu\u00e9 that they would <a href=\"http://eu-un.europa.eu/articles/en/article_8622_en.htm\">\u201cnot repeat the historic mistakes of protectionism of previous eras\u201d</a>.</p> <p>But while governments have generally not resorted to blatant protectionist measures of the kind that characterised the interwar years \u2013 the notorious Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in the US, for example, which slapped import taxes on more than 20,000 types of foreign goods \u2013 Evenett says they have often used quieter ways of giving domestic firms an unfair advantage.</p> <p>They might offer credit guarantees or tax rebates for exporters, for example \u2013 or just throw government money behind export promotion. Evenett\u2019s recent work suggests that 90% of the exports from least-developed countries \u2013 the world\u2019s poorest \u2013 have to compete against \u201csome kind of subsidised rival\u201d.</p> <p>And where politicians are pushing for renewed trade liberalisation \u2013 in the transatlantic trade deal known as TTIP, for example \u2013 they are facing a powerful public campaign from consumers nervous that multinationals will be handed too much control.</p> <p>Other bulwarks against globalisation are also on the agenda, from the tougher curbs on the rights of migrants being promoted by David Cameron as part of his renegotiation with the European Union, to the capital controls \u2013 albeit temporary \u2013 imposed by Cyprus after it was bailed out to prevent money flooding abroad. A recent Bank of England research paper noted that banks were retreating from cross-border lending, which is now perceived as jeopardising financial stability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a343a7706481b4cf8b72d3354a09930d549f4c3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432325525147/2e2ca0f2-8448-47ca-870a-ff65aeb615f4-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A scene before the start of a meeting in the WTO's Doha round of trade talks in 2006.

He argues that free capital flows are not a necessary part of globalisation. \u201cDid you expect me also to be for free love?\u201d he jokes. \u201cMaybe I am, but not because I\u2019m a free trader!\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1508.pdf\">Recent research by the International Monetary Fund</a>, highlighted by its managing director Christine Lagarde, suggested that developing countries must be cautious about so-called \u201cfinancial deepening\u201d \u2013 expanding their banking sectors and opening up their capital markets \u2013 because without tough regulation it can be too risky.</p> <p>Inflows of speculative \u201chot money\u201d can pump up asset prices and lead to a borrowing binge by consumers and businesses \u2013 which quickly turns to bust when global investors change their minds and pull their money back home. Some analysts expect these dynamics to be on display when the Federal Reserve finally starts to push up US interest rates, which is likely to happen this year.</p> <p>And just as governments have not always been good at protecting their citizens from rapid inflows and outflows of foreign money, the failure to shield workers from foreign competition has also undermined faith in globalisation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Obama's been a little bit subdued, but he\u2019s not going to want a protectionist legacy</p> <footer> <cite>Jagdish Bhagwati, economist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cOver the last 10 to 20 years, there has been an explosion of participation in the global economy of big, low-income countries: China, India, the former communist countries,\u201d says Fred Bergsten, senior fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who advises Barack Obama on trade policy.

He has owned his art conservation business, which began in Germany, for more than 30 years. Since the late 1980s, he\u2019s specialized in contemporary artworks made with temperamental and challenging materials. Petroleum jelly, human hair, latex or chewing gum: Scheidemann gives each material the respect and dedication a more traditional conservator might give oil or acrylic paint.</p> <p>\u201cWe like problems. We like solving problems,\u201d Scheidemann says. Contemporary Conservation has an 11-person staff including seven conservators, some of whom are in the studio deeply engaged with an artwork. The company might have 50 ongoing projects at one time, as art conservation is a painfully slow and lengthy process.</p> <p>Other studios, of course, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/05/arts/when-modern-art-shows-its-age-conservators-struggle-reconstruct-fragile.html\">restore contemporary art,</a> but some of the most unusual materials have <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/29/arts/new-art-materials-pose-conservation-problems.html\">long presented unusual problems</a>. Contemporary Conservation is unique in the US for its focus on unconventional materials. While most conservation studios focus on paintings or objects made with paper, glass or wood, materials such as elephant dung, polyurethane, wax and rubber tubes have been Contemporary Conservation\u2019s primary focus for decades. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e80d95c74447ad275aa2347ccca083f6c8bb227\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432029504141/8d3edefe-1ccb-47e0-8091-9daa074f3791-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Elephant dung given to Scheidemann by Chris Ofili.

Clients want to make them \u201csellable.\u201d Scheidemann doesn\u2019t simply fix art, although many clients would like him to do just that. \u201cWe are always exposed to value, devaluation,\u201d he says. Instead, he makes a judgment call on what to do with a piece, keeping in mind the artwork\u2019s historical context as well as the original intent of the artist.</p> <p>\u201cSome artists want the object to deteriorate and they expect it,\u201d says veteran art advisor Barbara Guggenheim, who works in New York and Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s called inherent vice.\u201d Other artists want their work to be eternally as fresh as the moment it left the studio 30 years before.</p> <p>Scheidemann has become the go-to guy in New York\u2019s contemporary art conservation market. His niche began by accident in 1989, after a child mistook one of artist Robert Gober\u2019s iconic sink-like instillations for a real sink and decided to hang on it. When the sculpture fell to the floor, its lip was shattered and its plaster chipped. </p> <p>Scheidemann was then the in-house conservator at the Deichtorhallen, the exhibition space in Hamburg where Gober\u2019s installation was being shown. Scheidemann flew to New York City to meet Gober, who gave him the right plaster, plywood and paint, and demonstrated how he had made it so that Scheidemann could restore the piece.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-db69f7ad-8fa5-4380-987d-6e610b7d6980\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432031900570/cf34546c-8ecd-430a-814f-ddbb12963f22-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"One of Robert Gober\u2019s sink installations.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Robert Gober\u2019s sink installations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russell Kaye, courtesy the artist and Matthew Marks Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soon after Scheidemann\u2019s return to Germany, Gober asked him to find a solution for a new piece of art: he needed doughnuts that wouldn\u2019t stain the paper bags holding them for his \u201cBag of Donuts\u201d series. Scheidemann obliged. Multimedia artist Matthew Barney then contacted Scheidemann to figure out how to best use a pound cake for one of Barney\u2019s pieces. Next came a request for preserving banana peels. Word spread and dealers like David Zwirner, Larry Gagosian and Paula Cooper were flying Scheidemann to New York for his expertise. He was in the city so often, Scheidemann decided to move his business to New York in 2002.</p> <p>Gober remains one of the artists with whom Scheidemann works closely, as do Matthew Barney, Paul McCarthy and Chris Ofili. \u201cHe\u2019s unafraid to talk to scientists, to find out about the physical properties of things, and he likes going into areas that he doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d Gober says. Scheidemann receives a stream of artists\u2019 questions via email or phone, like one recent message that asked his opinion about working with Himalayan salt blocks to attract live deer for an outdoor installation.</p> <p>Art advisor and appraiser Ren\u00e9e Vara first met Scheidemann when he was reapplying elephant dung that had fallen off of a Chris Ofili painting. He has the \u201csoul of an artist,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Scheidemann says he has always felt extremely privileged to be able to touch artwork and have access to artists\u2019 ideas and concepts. But when asked if he ever had artistic aspirations, he answers: \u201cDefinitely not, I have nothing to say.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/08/restoration-titians-mistress-genuine-duke-wellington-english-heritage-apsley\">The restoration game: painting revealed as genuine Titian</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scheidemann\u2019s business has steadily grown since his arrival in New York.

      "bodyText": "Christian Scheidemann\u2019s New York City studio looks more like a high-ceilinged gallery space than an art conservation workshop. Contemporary pieces dot the pristine space. A block of concrete embedded with a wooden chair by Doris Salcedo sits in one room; a doll submerged in a clear container full of chocolate, made by Dieter Roth, is in another. One table over is a Jason Rhoades bath towel assemblage topped with wax drippings that had been unraveled during a search for contraband by airport security. Scheidemann, 62, is the founder and president of Contemporary Conservation. He has owned his art conservation business, which began in Germany, for more than 30 years. Since the late 1980s, he\u2019s specialized in contemporary artworks made with temperamental and challenging materials. Petroleum jelly, human hair, latex or chewing gum: Scheidemann gives each material the respect and dedication a more traditional conservator might give oil or acrylic paint. \u201cWe like problems. We like solving problems,\u201d Scheidemann says. Contemporary Conservation has an 11-person staff including seven conservators, some of whom are in the studio deeply engaged with an artwork. The company might have 50 ongoing projects at one time, as art conservation is a painfully slow and lengthy process. Other studios, of course, restore contemporary art, but some of the most unusual materials have long presented unusual problems. Contemporary Conservation is unique in the US for its focus on unconventional materials. While most conservation studios focus on paintings or objects made with paper, glass or wood, materials such as elephant dung, polyurethane, wax and rubber tubes have been Contemporary Conservation\u2019s primary focus for decades. In his minimalist, book-lined office, the tall, calm Scheidemann explains that unlike in museum conservation departments, most of the works that come to his studio are in the process of changing owners. Clients want to make them \u201csellable.\u201d Scheidemann doesn\u2019t simply fix art, although many clients would like him to do just that. \u201cWe are always exposed to value, devaluation,\u201d he says. Instead, he makes a judgment call on what to do with a piece, keeping in mind the artwork\u2019s historical context as well as the original intent of the artist. \u201cSome artists want the object to deteriorate and they expect it,\u201d says veteran art advisor Barbara Guggenheim, who works in New York and Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s called inherent vice.\u201d Other artists want their work to be eternally as fresh as the moment it left the studio 30 years before. Scheidemann has become the go-to guy in New York\u2019s contemporary art conservation market. His niche began by accident in 1989, after a child mistook one of artist Robert Gober\u2019s iconic sink-like instillations for a real sink and decided to hang on it. When the sculpture fell to the floor, its lip was shattered and its plaster chipped. Scheidemann was then the in-house conservator at the Deichtorhallen, the exhibition space in Hamburg where Gober\u2019s installation was being shown. Scheidemann flew to New York City to meet Gober, who gave him the right plaster, plywood and paint, and demonstrated how he had made it so that Scheidemann could restore the piece. Soon after Scheidemann\u2019s return to Germany, Gober asked him to find a solution for a new piece of art: he needed doughnuts that wouldn\u2019t stain the paper bags holding them for his \u201cBag of Donuts\u201d series. Scheidemann obliged. Multimedia artist Matthew Barney then contacted Scheidemann to figure out how to best use a pound cake for one of Barney\u2019s pieces. Next came a request for preserving banana peels. Word spread and dealers like David Zwirner, Larry Gagosian and Paula Cooper were flying Scheidemann to New York for his expertise. He was in the city so often, Scheidemann decided to move his business to New York in 2002. Gober remains one of the artists with whom Scheidemann works closely, as do Matthew Barney, Paul McCarthy and Chris Ofili. \u201cHe\u2019s unafraid to talk to scientists, to find out about the physical properties of things, and he likes going into areas that he doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d Gober says. Scheidemann receives a stream of artists\u2019 questions via email or phone, like one recent message that asked his opinion about working with Himalayan salt blocks to attract live deer for an outdoor installation. Art advisor and appraiser Ren\u00e9e Vara first met Scheidemann when he was reapplying elephant dung that had fallen off of a Chris Ofili painting. He has the \u201csoul of an artist,\u201d she says. Scheidemann says he has always felt extremely privileged to be able to touch artwork and have access to artists\u2019 ideas and concepts. But when asked if he ever had artistic aspirations, he answers: \u201cDefinitely not, I have nothing to say.\u201d Scheidemann\u2019s business has steadily grown since his arrival in New York. Even the 2008 recession didn\u2019t stem the flow of Contemporary Conservation\u2019s incoming projects. It may have had the opposite effect, according to Scheidemann, who recalls that \u201cpeople were trying to sell their artworks, but they had to be repaired first\u201d. Hurricane Sandy also damaged a slew of pieces in 2012 that needed hefty conservation and restoration. Still, Contemporary Conservation has experienced a few bumps along the way, such as the difficulty in finding talented local conservators. All of Scheidemann\u2019s conservators are immigrants trained in Europe. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried American conservators and it hasn\u2019t worked out so far,\u201d says Scheidemann, though he adds, diplomatically: \u201cWe\u2019re still hoping.\u201d In the meantime, obtaining work visas for his employees has been an expensive and time consuming endeavor.
