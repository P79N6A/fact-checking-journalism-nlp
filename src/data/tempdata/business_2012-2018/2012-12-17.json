      "bodyText": "The incoming governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has been cleared of a conflict of interest after the Canadian central banker holidayed at the home of an opposition party leader. The Bank of Canada said Carney, who will take over from Sir Mervyn King next summer, was cleared of breaching rules despite a report that he stayed for a week in the home of a senior Liberal politician while the Canadian party was seeking to recruit him. Carney's flirtation with party politics may ruffle feathers at the Bank of England, where officials are expected to stay out of politics to maintain their reputation for independence. According to reports in the Toronto Globe and Mail, Carney and his family stayed at the home of the Scott Brison in Nova Scotia during part of their summer holiday. The Bank of Canada spokesman, Jeremy Harrison, said Carney and Brison had been personal friends for about a decade. \"The Bank of Canada's general counsel, who is responsible for enforcing the bank's conflict of interest policy, has assessed that this visit does not breach the bank's conflict of interest guidelines in any way,\" Harrison said in a statement. \"Neither the Bank of Canada nor Governor Carney have an actual or potential commercial or business relationship with Mr Brison. \"Mr Carney's acceptance of hospitality provided by a personal friend does not arise out of 'activities associated with official bank duties'. Nor can it be defined as partisan or political activity.\" The Globe and Mail reported that Brison, along with other senior party members, had expressed interest in seeing Carney lead the Liberal party. Carney was a surprise appointment last month when George Osborne said he had turned down applications from senior UK regulators and bank officials in favour of the Bank of Canada governor. The chancellor said Carney was \"the outstanding central banker of his generation\" and \"a person of real quality\" who would serve at the Bank of England for five years from next July. Little was known about his record other than he spent 13 years at investment bank Goldman Sachs before a meteoric rise at the central bank of his native Canada. In public, Carney has repeatedly batted away questions about political ambitions, saying at a news conference in October: \"Why don't I become a circus clown? I appreciate the great concern about my career but I have gainful employment and I intend to continue it.\" But the latest revelations have led to criticisms from some commentators, who say there are risks that the central bank's impartiality could be called into question if officials are linked too closely to politics. The bank's conflict of interest guidelines urge employees to avoid the appearance of impropriety in accepting hospitality or gifts. \"It does show a complete lack of judgment,\" said Mike Moffat, an economist at the Ivey school of business at the University of Western Ontario. \"The larger issue here is that Carney is being seen as the guy who can do no wrong,\" Moffat said. \"For the most part, he's been a very strong governor. There's some point where you start to believe that anything you do is justified because you've been doing such a great job and that's where these sort of ethical lapses get in.\"",

Since then questions have been raised about whether the relationship between Johannesson's empire and Glitnir \u2013 one of three Icelandic banks that fell in the crash \u2013 had become too close.</p> <p>Johannesson's Baugur group and linked businesses borrowed more than \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) from Glitnir before the country's financial meltdown, making them by far the bank's biggest exposure to risk.

Charges against them and two associates have been filed by Iceland's special prosecutor, Olafur Hauksson, who is pursuing multiple criminal inquiries stemming from Iceland's financial crash. The charges relate to illegal lending and to aiding or abetting such lending. Prosecutors are seeking the maximum sentence under Icelandic law of six years in jail.</p> <p>A lawyer acting for Johannesson declined to comment on Monday but \u2014 together with Welding and two co-defendents \u2014 the former Baugur tycoon is expected to appear in court in Reykjavik on 7 January to plead not guilty. Johannesson and Welding, both of whom live in London, have denied wrongdoing in parallel civil proceedings.</p> <p>Johannesson already has a criminal conviction for corporate misconduct in Iceland following lengthy investigation into historic activities at Baugur dating back to 2002.

      "bodyText": "Do central banks care about unemployment more than inflation? To some extent it is an intergenerational issue. The question arises after the winner in the Japanese general election on Sunday, the Liberal Democratic party's Shinzo Abe, demanded the Bank of Japan accept higher inflation as a fair trade off for policies that could kickstart the moribund economy. The demand follows a speech by US central bank chief Ben Bernanke, who has taken the hint that unemployment remains too high and said, in central banker code, that cutting unemployment will be his chief target. If he starts to see prices rises get out of control, then he will pay attention to the old inflation target, but making sure the US avoids millions of long term unemployed is priority number one. In the UK, the Bank of England can already point to three years of measures unemployment targeting at the expense of inflation. Its policy of printing money under its quantitative easing plan has infuriated inflation hawks and savers groups, who want to maintain the pre-crisis focus on fighting high inflation. And here we have the intergenerational issue in a nutshell. Older people with pots of cash in savings and investment accounts want low inflation to protect their assets. Young people, who have only small savings, if any at all, and big debts, are keener on having a job to pay the bills. Constant influxes of migrants and young people into the US labour market keeps the population young and agitating much more for a job than low inflation. Bernanke is susceptible to the younger and poorer element, many of whom voted for president Obama, when he reviews his policies. Old Europe, grey of head and weak of limb, prefers to pay the bills from gains on its savings wealth. Voters in Italy, Belgium and Germany demand the European Central Bank remain unreconstructed. Inflation remains the focus of the ECB board. The UK straddles both camps and as such, charts a middle course somewhere between the ECB and the US Federal Reserve, though the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is expected to start tacking towards the US soon. Governor Sir Mervyn King's successor, the Canadian Mark Carney, joined in the debate last week when he said inflation targeting could be abandoned completely in favour of tracking nominal GDP, which is another way of saying the central bank should seek to maintain growth (and jobs as a key byproduct). The Japanese situation is different because after two decades of virtually zero inflation and zero growth, even the ageing savers of Tokyo understand they need a bit of inflation in the system (if only to make people spend a bit more now rather than tomorrow when their spending power is diminished by rising prices). Economics, then, is a battle of the generations as much as it is a battle between rich and poor. There are plenty of young people who will be gifted or inherit wealth from their well-off parents, giving them an opportunity to own property denied many of their compatriots. But there are few families these days who can create or pass on a job. The economy needs to create jobs and it can only do that if the economy is moving. The only downside for workers in letting inflation rise jump to more than double its current 2% \"optimum level\", as envisaged by dovish central bankers, is that employers feel little pressure to maintain wage rates. Past generations have inflated away their debts knowing they had the power as workers to maintain their wages in real terms. But in an era of declining trade union strength that is harder for the average worker. When employers fail to maintain the spending power of wages, only property owners gain. Maybe that's the point of the exercise.",

There are specific funds in place to enable loans to be made not only to sovereigns for their own use but also for them to pass onto their banking sector if required. There is the large amount of background work that is being undertaken to put some kind of banking union in place and whilst central control over individual countries budgets, debt mutualisation and common Euro bonds are no further forward in the utterances of many politicians, they are not off the agenda completely.</p> <p>Or to be more accurate they are being put on the agenda by the European Council and then summarily ignored by the politicians. But, hey that\u2019s progress of sorts!</p> <p>Anyhow the point is that whilst we are watching everything unfold minute by minute, day by day in what seems like a tortuous slow process to try to contain and combat the crisis, maybe future historians will look back with the benefit of time and conclude that all these changes either took place or at least the start of the processes to enact significant change all took place in only a few years.</p> <p>They may wonder at how such massive economic and political change from the previously stated ideals could occur in such a short space of time.

      "bodyText": "I'm going to wrap up for the day now. Here's a brief closing summary \u2022 ECB president Mario Draghi has warned MEPs that 2013 will be tough for Europe, and defended himself against criticism that he's failing to keep to his mandate. See 2.58pm onwards. \u2022 Draghi, Herman Van Rompuy (2.39pm) and David Cameron (4.16pm) all welcomed the banking supervision deal reached last week. \u2022 Political tension increased in Italy, with president Giorgio Napolitano expressing concern over Mario Monti's decision to resign (see 4.31pm onwards). Monti himself is expected to reveal his plans on Friday, while predecessor Silvio Berlusconi won headlines with the news of his engagement to Francesca Pascale (see 9.25am to learn how the 49-year age gap won't be too much of a problem) \u2022 China remains concerned about Europe's prospects, with a senior executive from its sovereign wealth fund warning that he is not optimistic about the region's prospects (see 8.26am). Thanks for reading and commenting (if you did!) on one of our quieter days. Will be back tomorrow for more of the same.... Goodnight! Italian President Giorgio Napolitano is continuing his TV address, telling citizens that the country's next government must push on with economic reforms during its five-year term. He also urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing Italy's credibility in the run-up to next year's election - a reminder that the country cannot risk alarming the financial markets given its borrowing obligations for 2013. Greece's long (long!) awaited aid tranche has finally arrived in Athens, according to the Wall Street Journal: Italy's president, Giorgio Napolitano, is giving a public speech on the political situation now. It's being livestreamed here. Napolitano began by saying that he is \"concerned\" by the way Mario Monti's technocratic government is ending abruptly. He also stated that the next government must undertake \"wide-ranging institutional and economic reforms\". Over in Westminster, David Cameron has been updating the House of Commons on last week's EU summit. The PM told MPs that the banking supervision deal was \"a good deal for Britain\", pointing to an agreement not to discriminate against Britain's banking industry. These safeguards set a precedent in terms of safeguarding the interests of countries outside the eurozone, he says. However, Cameron also said the deal is \"not a fully-fledged banking union\". My colleague Andrew Sparrow has been blogging the full statement in today's Politics Live (from 3.39pm). The ECB has now uploaded Mario Draghi's opening statement. It's got quite a punchy opening: This year has not been an easy one. It has been a year when the ties that bind the Member States of the euro area have been tested. But it has also been a year in which a longer-term vision for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has been formulated. And it is a year in which that vision has begun to be translated into actions, including on vital reforms of European governance. Mario Draghi has now warned MEPs that Europe cannot suddenly abandon austerity and economic reforms. The ECB president told the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that: There was a need for fiscal adjustment. It wasn't something unwarranted or unjustified. Significant progress has been made so far. Going back on this would be to lose credibility and to start all over again. The ECB knew this would be for the long term. Any wavering would be counterproductive, it would mean higher interest rates and restarting the negative cycle. When you have very big budget deficits, you didn't have any growth either. And here's the full quote from Draghi about how tough 2013 will be: We expect domestic weakness to extend into next year with a very gradual recovery in the second half of the year. The recovery is expected to be supported by strengthening global demand, a highly accommodative monetary policy stance and significantly improved confidence in financial markets, all of which should work their way through to spending and investment decisions. But as I blogged first thing this morning (see 8.26am) China is holding back from investing more in Europe because it is concerned about the region's prospects, and doesn't see it as a partlcularly alluring opportunity...... Here's a couple of photos of Draghi in action: Mario Draghi went on to rebut criticism of his recent actions -- in particular the claim that the eurozone's central bank has abandoned its mandate of controlling inflation in favour of providing fiscal support to weaker countries. Draghi also denied that the ECB would be compromised when it takes over the supervision of the eurozone's banks (a concern within Germany). He insisted it would have \"no bearing whatsoever\" on monetary policy: It bears neither on the mandate itself, which is statutory, nor on its quantified expression of inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Quite a defensive performance from the ECB president so far... ECB president Mario Draghi began his appearance at the European Parliament by warning that the economic conditions in Europe are tricky and will remain so for some time: The medium-term outlook for economic activity remains challenging. Draghi also echoed Herman Van Rompuy's support for the deal on eurozone banking supervision agreed last week, saying it will help rebuild confidence in the European banking sector. It will revive interbank lending and cross-border credit flows, with tangible effects for the real economy. In other words, other banks will be less wary of lending to a European rival, \u00e0 la the credit crunch. Mario Draghi's appearance at the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is now under way (although I'm having the very devil of a time getting the live stream to work). Early highlights to follow.... Europe's three presidents have also been speaking at the European Parliament this lunchtime. European Council president Herman Van Rompuy, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Parliament President Martin Schulz all updated MEPs about last week's summit. Van Rompuy's team have tweeted his key points, which include hailing the deal for a single supervision mechanism for eurozone banks, and repeating his claim that the worst of the crisis is over... (MS=Member States) ECB president Mario Draghi is due to appear at the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs at 2.30pm GMT (3.30pm local time) - ie, in around 10 minutes. It's being livestreamed here. The London stock market has taken a negative turn in recent hours, with other markets becalmed. FTSE 100: down 30 points at 5890, - 0.5% German DAX: flat at 7596 points French CAC: down 9 points at 3633, -0.25% Spanish IBEX: flat at 8024 points Italian FTSE MIB: up 20 points at 15928, +0.1% The FTSE was partly driven down by profits warning from power supply company Aggreko (details here). David Madden, market analyst at IG, said traders were \"torn between the east and the west today\": The news that Shinzo Abe won the latest Japanese elections drove stocks higher overnight, but the dreaded US fiscal cliff has taken the edge off his victory. Mr Abe is in favour of further monetary easing, and stocks rallied as investors feel he is likely to appoint a governor to the Bank of Japan (BoJ) who will toe the line. The yen hit a new 20-month low against the US dollar this morning, on predictions of an aggressive monetary easing plan from Tokyo. But as Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define thinktank points out, it's tricky for every struggling country to ease (or devalue) their way to growth at the same time. Another Greek development \u2013 the EU's task force dispatched to Greece has warned today that Athens has fallen behind its target of recovering \u20ac2bn of outstanding tax receipts during 2012. By the end of October, the taskforce said, Greece had only recovered \u20ac1bn. Just 88 audits of large taxpayers had been conducted, against a target of 300, and just 467 of \"high-wealth individuals\"had been probed, versus a target of 1,300. Despite the slippage, commissioner Olli Rehn declared that Greece was making progress, saying: Greece is tackling deep-rooted structural problems with determination and resolve, as has been recognised by the Eurogroup. The Task Force is working hard to help Greece implement essential reforms to boost its competitiveness, create a fairer and more effective tax system, and generate sustainable growth and employment. It appears that the full text of the latest official review of Greece's economy has been released to the public. Called \"The Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece \u2013 First Review\", it is available for download from the EC's website. It starts by explaining how the Greek economy performed worse than expected, due to political instability (the two general elections) and the weakness of the global economy. It warns that Greece's tax collection system is failing to meet its targets, and that privatisations have been disappointing. It pays tribute to Antonis Samaras's government, before warning that there are very large \"implementation risks\" to the programme. Here's a flavour, as another reminder that the crisis is not over yet: The key risks concern the overall policy implementation, given that the coalition supporting the government appears fragile and some components of the programme face political resistance, despite the determination of the government. Moreover, the impact on the weakened economy of the pronounced fiscal consolidation in 2013 may be stronger than currently foreseen, even though it could also be mitigated by the liquidity injection from clearance of government arrears. Important budgetary measures are likely to be challenged in courts, which could lead to the need to fill a fiscal gap emerging as a consequence. Should product and services market reforms not accelerate as foreseen under the programme, positive economic growth could not return in 2014 as foreseen. A return to sustained growth can only be achieved when the structural reform agenda is fully and swiftly implemented. It was released by the EC's Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs: A new round of anti-austerity protests have been called for this evening in Spain. AP has the details: Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to pack the streets of Spanish cities in evening protests against the conservative government's anti-crisis austerity measures. The demonstrations Monday have been called by the main labor unions and dozens of social groups. They are to take place in 55 cities. Union leaders are to head what is expected to be the largest march in Madrid. This follows yesterday's demonstrations against changes to the country's healthcare system (see 11.18am for photos) Spanish cities were at the forefront of last month's co-ordinated general strike against austerity, and there is deep anger against the government's austerity plans. City analysts are in reflective mood today as the end of the year looms, reflecting on the events of 2012 and wondering what 2013 has in store. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research argues that future generations may marvel at how much Europe has changed since the crisis began: When it comes to the more general decisions will historians come to reflect on how quickly politicians moved to quell the crisis and how flexible they were when it came to interpretation of law and rules? After all it was only a short few years ago that the mantra in Europe was \u201cno bailouts\u201d yet in a very short space of time we have moved from no bailouts to not only multiple bailouts having occurred but also assistance being available for anyone who requests it. There are specific funds in place to enable loans to be made not only to sovereigns for their own use but also for them to pass onto their banking sector if required. There is the large amount of background work that is being undertaken to put some kind of banking union in place and whilst central control over individual countries budgets, debt mutualisation and common Euro bonds are no further forward in the utterances of many politicians, they are not off the agenda completely. Or to be more accurate they are being put on the agenda by the European Council and then summarily ignored by the politicians. But, hey that\u2019s progress of sorts! Anyhow the point is that whilst we are watching everything unfold minute by minute, day by day in what seems like a tortuous slow process to try to contain and combat the crisis, maybe future historians will look back with the benefit of time and conclude that all these changes either took place or at least the start of the processes to enact significant change all took place in only a few years. They may wonder at how such massive economic and political change from the previously stated ideals could occur in such a short space of time. And without much involvement from the electorate\u2026It would appear that we are indeed moving towards a scenario which makes the European Union resemble a fiscal union to the market, but it is still technically a monetary one for the sake of its population. Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem is now the firm front-runner to become the next head of the eurogroup. Dijsselbloem emerged as a likely successor to Jean-Claude Juncker as the head of the gang of eurozone finance ministers last Friday. This morning, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper has declared it a done deal. Dijsselbloem has played down the idea, saying rather engagingly that he'd be happy to do the job but it would be more worrying not to be on the lengthy list of possible contenders. Dijsselbloem has only been in office a few weeks, and lacks the heavyweight credentials of, say, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. But our Europe editor, Iay Traynor, explains that Brussels top brass don't want another Juncker: Yesterday, public anger against Spain's austerity programme hit the streets again. Thousands of Spanish health workers, patients and supporters protested against plans to partially privatise the country's health sector, by selling off the management of six of 20 public hospitals and 27 of 268 health centres. Here are some photos from Madrid: More European economic news \u2013 labour costs continued to lag behind inflation, rising by an annual rate of just 2% in the eurozone during the third quarter of 2012, and 1.9% across the EU (that's also via Eurostat). The survey (which doesn't include data from Greece), showed that the highest annual increases in hourly labour costs were recorded in Estonia (+7.6%) and Romania (+7.2%), while they actually fell by 0.8% in Slovenia (where several anti-austerity rallies have taken place in recent weeks). Overall, European employees' wages are being pegged back by the weak labour market and record unemployment across the region. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight warns that workers have little power at present: There is a need for companies to hold down their wage and total labour costs in a very challenging and uncertain environment, while appreciable and rising labour market slack in most Eurozone countries means that workers have little, if any, bargaining power. Just in, the eurozone posted a trade surplus of \u20ac10.2bn for October, up from a deficit of \u20ac0.7bn the previous year (with no seasonal adjustments). New data from Eurostat showed that the value of exports from the euro area to the rest of the world jumped by 14% during the month, while imports rose by 7%. Eurostat also reported that exports to most major countries from the wider European Union were up over the first nine months of 2012: The most notable increases were recorded for exports to South Korea (+16%), Russia and Japan (both +15%), the USA and Brazil (both +13%). However, exports to India fell -5%. The data might reassure the Chinese Investment Corp that the European economy is heading in the right direction (although analysts had actually expected a higher surplus, of \u20ac11bn). Mario Monti will outline his future plans on Friday, it appears, in his end of the year address. As Alberto Nardelli flags up, the technocratic PM could present a list of candidates who support him, giving Monti a powerbase for a post-election coalition. Or he could simply present a reform manifesto which parties could support -- giving legitimacy to Monti continuing as leader after the election.... Two interesting developments in Italy this morning, at either end of the spectrum. Mario Monti will reveal his future plans to the nation in a speech before the end of the year. Speculation continues to grow that Monti might run as a candidate in the forthcoming elections. His co-operation minister, Andrea Riccardi, fuelled the talk, saying on Sunday that: I believe the Monti will remain a morale and political point of reference for a great coming together of men and women who want to change Italy. I know that Monti will speak to the country and will lay out his argument. With the centre-left parties holding a lead in the polls, some right-leaning politicans believe they need a credible, untarnished candidate \u2026 \u2026 rather than Silvio Berlusconi - who has announced that he plans to marry his 27-year-old girlfriend Francesca Pascale. In an interview yesterday, Berlusconi declared: Yes, I'm engaged, to a Neapolitan (a person from Naples). It's official. She is so much younger that there is an age difference of 49 years between me and her - so a little excessive. She is 27-years-old, she is called Francesca and she is a beautiful girl, beautiful from the outside, but even more beautiful inside. She brings continuous joy. She's very close to me, she loves me very much and I love her back. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved, eh? (and thanks to Sky News for the quotes). Berlusconi also discussed political affairs, saying he would only withdraw as a candidate in the election if current leader Mario Monti agreed to run as head of an alliance of \"moderate\" parties. In the financial markets, the German DAX just hit its highest level in almost five years. The DAX nudged 7,627 points in early trading, a gain of 31 points, for the first time since January 2008. Other markets are rather lacklustre, though, with the FTSE 100 down 16 points at 5904. There's a real pre-Christmas feel about the City today, with little to excite the trading floors (apart from the cricket!) Jesse Wang's comments about the situation in the eurozone are timely, as European Central Bank president Mario Draghi will testify on the crisis today. Draghi will appear before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs at 3.30pm local time, or 2.30pm GMT. As well as discussing the state of the eurozone economy, Draghi will presumably give his views on 2013. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts: ECB President Draghi is scheduled to speak to the European Parliament about the latest goings-on in Europe and what he would like to see from politicians in the wake of the recent slide in bond yields as a result of actions by the ECB to calm financial markets. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis, and other key events in the world economy. First up: China's powerful sovereign wealth fund has warned European leaders that the outlook for the eurozone remains very tough. Jesse Wang Jianxi, executive vice-president at China Investment Corp, diluted the pre-Christmas spirit in Europe by telling a conference that CIC was wary of investing more in the region. Speaking on the island of Hainan, Wang said: I think the outlook for the European debt crisis is not optimistic yet. We have been investing actively in European countries and if the heavily indebted countries and European Union can provide a more friendly investment environment, I think we can invest more actively in the future. European leaders have been actively lobbying China to help them out of the crisis \u2013 Angela Merkel visited the country twice in 2012 in an effort to drum up trade and investment (in February and August). Wang's comments, though, show that Beijing remains sceptical about the eurozone, despite optimism in Brussels that the worst of the crisis is over. With resources of around $480bn (\u00a3300bn), CIC's concerns should carry weight. And as Reuters points out, China has resisted buying into Europe's bailout fund \u2013 and is keen to see Europe's richer nations contribute more. For CIC, a \"more friendly investment environment\" means one with a greater focus on growth, rather than self-defeating fiscal consolidation. Last month, the chair of its board warned that European austerity has now pushed the public close to \"breaking point\". He also argued that the European Central Bank should engage in more \"unorthodox\" measures to turn the region's slump around. So, a reminder that the crisis has not abated. As usual we'll be tracking all the latest developments though the day, as the end of the year approaches....",

Now they have moved 8.58p higher to 43.22p after Centamin said the customs ban had now been lifted, and a shipment of gold was made on Sunday, paving the way for Sukari to reopen. It said: We expect both fuel supply and normal operations at Sukari to resume in the coming days, once payment for the latest shipment has been received and working capital in the operation company has subsequently been replenished. Kate Craig at Liberum Capital said: [This is] clearly positive for the stock today. Around one week's production has been lost, earnings downgrades to follow. Numis added: Two issues resolved...now just the court case [over whether its rights over Sukari are valid], although the wider Egyptian political instability remains. Our recommendation remains under review while we work through any potential affects to results but the shares should take another jump up this morning. Meanwhile Capital Drilling, which supplies rigs and counts Centamin as a key customer, has climbed 9.5% to 21.5p after being hit by the disputes.",
