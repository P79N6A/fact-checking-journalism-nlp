      "bodyText": "With that story on ministers getting ready to discuss measures to contain the fallout from a potential default, we are now closing the live blog for today but Graeme Wearden will be back with a weekend special edition on Saturday. Before I go, a quick summary of the main events from a day characterised again by a war of words and yet another suggestion - quickly rebutted by Greece - of kicking the can another few months down the road. Eurozone finance ministers and Greece\u2019s creditors are to draw up plans for emergency measures to ringfence the country\u2019s financial system unless the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accepts the creditors\u2019 terms for a five-month extension of Athens\u2019s bailout on Saturday. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis says reaching a deal on Saturday depends on the creditors. Meanwhile a senior European official has struck an upbeat note, saying chances of a deal are more than 50%. Hopes of a deal helped steady global stock markets. Grece\u2019s creditors had proposed a five-month bailout extension and Eurozone sources suggested differences between the two sides had narrowed. But Greece said it had rejected the proposed extension and Tsipras has called a cabinet meeting for this evening to prepare for the Eurogroup talks. UK PM David Cameron has told a fellow EU leader that it \u201cmight be better\u201d for Greece to withdraw from the eurozone to allow it to fix its economy, according to a leaked diplomatic document. As the cabinet meets in Athens tonight, communist party supporters have poured into Syntagma square to protest against the demands for more austerity by Greece\u2019s creditors. On the eve of crunch talks in Brussels, our main story tonight is that eurozone finance ministers and Greece\u2019s creditors are to draw up plans for emergency measures to ringfence the country\u2019s financial system unless the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accepts the creditors\u2019 terms for a five-month extension of Athens\u2019s bailout on Saturday. Our Europe Editor Ian Traynor reports from Brussels: Greece has its last chance to bow to the lenders\u2019 terms following five months of stalemate at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on Saturday afternoon, the fifth such session in 10 days. Fearing a financial implosion and social unrest in the event of the negotiations collapsing, the ministers are scheduled to draw up plans on Saturday for capital controls, including curbs on ATM withdrawals, to stem a flood of funds out of the ailing Greek financial system. \u201cGame over\u201d, said senior EU officials engaged in back-to-back meetings and negotiations for the past 10 days, as the brinkmanship in the Greek negotiations reached breaking point. If no deal is agreed at the weekend, Greece will miss a \u20ac1.6bn payment due to the International Monetary Fund next Tuesday, along with access to emergency support from the European Central Bank that is keeping the Greek banking system afloat. Read the full story here: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis sees no reason his country and its creditors will not get a deal at Saturday\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. Varoufakis, who said earlier that Greece was determined to stay in the eurozone but that Athens would not sign an agreement with lenders that it considered \u201cunviable\u201d, is quoted in a series of alerts on Reuters this evening: 26-Jun-2015 18:16:41 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS SAYS SATURDAY\u2019S EUROGROUP WILL TRY TO CONVERGE ON A DEAL THAT INCLUDES DEBT, FUNDING 26-Jun-2015 18:17:50 - GREEK FINMIN SAYS GREECE HAS MADE CONCESSIONS, ATHENS REJECTS 5-MONTH FUNDING PROPOSAL FROM LENDERS 26-Jun-2015 18:22:22 - VAROUFAKIS SAYS GREECE PROPOSED THAT ESM RESCUE FUND COULD TAKE OVER GREEK DEBT HELD BY ECB 26-Jun-2015 18:25:26 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER SAYS WON\u2019T DENY GREEK PROPOSAL CONTAINS RECESSIONARY MEASURES BUT THEY ARE AIMED AT HIGHER INCOMES 26-Jun-2015 18:30:10 - GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS SAYS LENDERS REVERTED TO TOUGHER DEMANDS, SIX EUROGROUP MINISTERS SAID CREDITORS\u2019 PROPOSAL WAS TOO SOFT ON GREECE 26-Jun-2015 18:39:47 - GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS SAYS SEES NO REASON WE WILL NOT HAVE A DEAL ON SATURDAY Our reporter Jon Henley is in Syntagma square where communist party supporters have gathered to protest against the demands for more austerity by creditors. Tsipras\u2019s impossible dilemma Veteran political commentator Yannis Pretenderis says not since the return of democracy in 1974, following the collapse of military rule, has Greece faced such a critical moment. Speaking on Mega TV\u2019s flagship news programme, Pretenderis said the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was facing an almost \u201cimpossible dilemma.\u201d \u201cEither he accepts a deal that is financially very, very hard, with extraordinarily painful measures, or he accepts bankruptcy, catastrophe. It is an almost impossible dilemma, one that no-one would want to face and honestly, right now, I have no idea which way we will go. It will be hard to sleep well tonight.\u201d Helena reports that the Greek prime minister has just arrived, in a black sedan, straight from the airport to host that emergency cabinet meeting, as trailed earlier. Over in Athens protesting communist party supporters have poured into Syntagma square, reports Helena Smith. As I write thousands of communist party protestors have taken to the streets to protest against the demands for more austerity by creditors. Their rallying cry: \u201cno to the new agreement, rupture with lenders.\u201d The KKE communist party has released a statement saying: \u201cWe have paid enough for the blackmail and mockery between the government and lenders. Let there be rupture with the European Union, capital and their power.\u201d If you were wondering what UK prime minister David Cameron thinks should happen, then turn to this story from my colleagues on a leaked diplomatic document. Alberto Nardelli and Nicholas Watt report that Cameron told a fellow EU leader that it \u201cmight be better\u201d for Greece to withdraw from the eurozone to allow it to fix its economy, according to the document. They write: As eurozone finance ministers prepare to hold an emergency meeting on Saturday on the Greek crisis, the document suggests that the British prime minister believes a Greek exit may be the best option, though he acknowledged it would carry \u201cmajor risks\u201d. The note, a leaked account of a private discussion between the prime minister and one of his European counterparts about his EU reform demands, indicates that Cameron made his remarks in an informal part of the meeting. The note says: \u201cOn Greece, the PM wondered if it was wise for Angela Merkel to allow the discussion with Greece to take place at PM level and mused that it might be better for Greece to leave the eurozone in order to sort its economy out \u2013 though also accepted that there were major risks in that too.\u201d Read the full story: Meanwhile, back in Athens, an emergency cabinet meeting is due to start shortly at the prime minister\u2019s office, the Megaro Maximou. Ministers are already arriving to attend the meeting, reports Helena Smith. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has yet to appear but is about to land in Athens from Brussels. As labour minister Panos Skourletis told Helena earlier, the entire government was asked to be on standby after Tsipras rejected a proposed bailout extension from Greece\u2019s creditors. Our Europe Editor Ian Traynor reports from Brussels that eurozone finance ministers and Greece\u2019s creditors are preparing to draw up plans for emergency measures on Saturday to quarantine the country in the event of default next week - unless Tsipras accepts the terms for a bailout extension. More coming soon. Looking beyond Tuesday\u2019s IMF payment deadline, economists at Citi have put out a handy chart of some key dates for Greece. Under the headline \u201cAre We There Yet?\u201d the investment bank\u2019s economists write that they are still expecting an interim deal: An \u2018interim\u2019 deal remains our baseline \u2014 We still believe that an agreement to extend the current aid programme (for up to six months) is likely to be found soon as modest concessions from both sides appear achievable. But we acknowledge increasing risks that the process could take us beyond the June 30 deadline, which would likely result in the imposition of capital controls, after an IMF default. But they highlight rising politicial risks on several fronts: i) failure to pass the package in parliament, ii) failure to implement \u2018prior actions\u2019, iii) increasing social tensions, iv) deepening splits within Syriza leading to a possible government collapse and early elections.\u201d Now time to get your diaries out and pencil in some more deadlines: The Greek government has just produced one of its famous non-papers, this time a seven-point one, explaining why it cannot accept the proposal by creditors to extend the country\u2019s current bailout programme until November, reports Helena Smith in Athens. It states: \u201cThe proposal by the institutions to the Greek government entailed immediate legislation of deep recessionary measures [which would hurt the already wounded social fabric of the country] as a pre-condition of five months of financing, which anyway, was judged to be wholly inadequate.\u201d \u201cIf this proposal had been accepted by the government and parliament, people and markets would have faced another five months of further shrinkage which would have lead to yet another negotiation under conditions of crisis. That is one of the reasons why the institutions\u2019 proposal cannot be accepted.\u201d Prolongation of the current bailout programme would have led \u201cwith mathematical precision\u201d to a new round of tough negotiations and a new, catastrophic memorandum [rescue programme] at the end of the year, it said. \u201cThe government does not have a popular mandate, nor the moral right, to sign up to a new memorandum,\u201d said the announcement. Here is more from Reuters reporting an EU official saying chances of a deal at Saturday\u2019s crunch meeting are more than 50%. Its correspondents in Brussels write: The EU official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks, said despite the hardline position of most eurozone finance ministers, EU leaders expressed the political will at a summit in Brussels to take half a step towards Greece. The chances of a deal on Saturday, when eurozone finance ministers meet at 1200 GMT were better than 50%, the official said, although it was less certain if the Greek parliament would endorse an agreement struck by the government. To facilitate a deal, the creditors could restate a November 2012 pledge by euro zone finance ministers to help make Greek public debt sustainable by extending loan maturities and a moratorium on interest payments and lowering interest rates. If Greece were to accept the offer with some small new concessions to accommodate Athens\u2019 views, the country could then count on financing for the next five months -- until the end of November -- thanks to a bailout exension. Full story here. As the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras heads back to Athens from Brussels, voices of dissent are growing in his far left Syriza party, reports Helena Smith. The time has come to say the \u201cbig no\u201d, the Syriza MP Yannis Micheloyiannakis said, praising the Greek leader\u2019s rejection of the lenders\u2019 offer to prolong Greece\u2019s current bailout programme until November. \u201cThere is no bigger mistake than accepting an extension until November in exchange for the blood of measures and our own money,\u201d the MP said in an announcement. \u201cIt would be humiliating, and at the same time tantamount to acceptance of the course towards a third memorandum [bailout accord] in November. Now is the time to say the big no.\u201d While Greek officials are briefing that nothing has been agreed to, an EU official is now quoted on Reuters as saying hopes of a deal are still relatively high. 26-Jun-2015 16:30:00 - GREECE, CREDITORS CONTINUE REFORM DEAL TALKS, THERE IS SOME SCOPE TO ACCOMDATE THE GREEKS- SENIOR EU OFFICIAL 26-Jun-2015 16:30:00 - DEAL WITH GREECE LIKELY TO INCLUDE RESTATEMENT OF EURO ZONE NOV 2012 PLEDGE ON READINNESS TO LOOK AT GREEK DEBT RESCHEDULING- SENIOR EU OFFCIAIL 26-Jun-2015 16:30:00 - EVEN IF THERE IS A DEAL, GREECE WILL PROBABLY BE FOR A FEW DAYS IN ARREARS WITH THE IMF AS TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE JUNE 30 PAYMENT - SENIOR EU OFFICIAL 26-Jun-2015 16:30:00 - BEING IN ARREARS WITH IMF FOR FEW DAYS IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD FOR GREECE AS LONG AS THERE IS CLEAR DEAL - SENIOR EU OFFICIAL 26-Jun-2015 16:30:00 - SENIOR EU OFFICIAL SAYS CHANCE OF DEAL WITH GRECE ON SATURDAY HIGHER THAN 50 PCT As the Greek crisis hurtles towards another big deadline, our reporter Jon Henley [not our Southern Europe Editor John Hooper, as previously reported - with apologies to both] has been considering the role of IMF head Christine Lagarde and what could well be a career-defining few days for the Frenchwoman. Jon writes: By turns business-like and ineffably charming, straight-talking and surprisingly funny, Lagarde\u2019s unusual mix of Gallic charm and Anglo-Saxon effectiveness is undoubtedly better appreciated in international circles than in France. The next few days could make or break her reputation. The full profile is here: Helena reports that the deputy social security minister Dimitris Stratoulis has also levelled an excoriating critique of the lenders\u2019 latest proposal. The creditors\u2019 latest offer amounted to \u201cthe ultimate demolition\u201d of the welfare state and \u201ctotal misery and impoverishment\u201d of those already on very low pensions, he said. The ruling Syriza party had decided to take action. \u201c[We] will erect a wall against the brazen claims of creditors who seek the complete humiliation of the left government and [whose actions will] lead to the enslavement and extermination of [our] people.\u201d Over in Athens the labour minister Panos Skourletis has told our correspondent, Helena Smith, that there will be no agreement \u201cuntil there is an agreement\u201d and that the entire government is now on standby with the possibility of an urgent cabinet meeting being held tonight, once prime minister Alexis Tsipras returns to the Greek capital. \u201cWe have agreed to nothing. And there will be no agreement until there is an agreement with which all of us concur,\u201d Skourletis has just told me. \u201cWe are expecting Tsipras to return from Brussels at around 8pm and there is a strong possibility that a cabinet meeting will be held tonight, or first thing tomorrow. We have all been asked to be on standby.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just a drama for us, it\u2019s a drama for them,\u201d he said referring to the lenders. \u201cWe have moved from a take-it-or-leave-it scenario to the proposal of a five-month extension that makes no sense.\u201d The latest offer was tantamount to committing suicide, insisted Skourletis. Asked if he was fearful of Greece slipping over the edge and being ejected from the eurozone, he told me: \u201cOf course we are afraid but we are more afraid to sign something that would mean the end of our people and patrida [homeland].\u201d Is this the \u201cfinal deadline\u201d, ask economists at Morgan Stanley. Either way, they are downbeat about the chances of this weekend coming up with a deal that amounts to a long-term resolution of the Greek debt crisis. Writing in their weekly research note, they comment: Even though the economic incentive is to secure a deal, the political incentive may get in the way, especially given a very tight deadline. The damage to mutual trust between debtor and creditors that the negotiations have produced is quite substantial, in our view. That\u2019s why, even if there\u2019s an 11th hour resolution, the chances are that it will mostly provide short-term financing to the Greek sovereign against strong monitoring of whether the creditors\u2019 demands truly are implemented. With Greece likely to struggle on this front, any agreement over the next several days \u2013 while positive for sentiment \u2013 is likely to postpone the next bout of political volatility a few months down the road, until a more visible shift in Greece\u2019s domestic policies comes into play. Helena Smith in Athens will have more shortly on Greece\u2019s move to reject a proposed bailout extentions. In the meantime, a quick refresher on what\u2019s on the table in these cash-for-reforms talks. The main sticking points have been pensions followed by VAT and other taxes. This lays out the main issues: Government sources are also quoted as saying that the lenders\u2019 latest proposal is simply unviable - and the rescue funds offered (\u20ac15.5bn) are insufficient to cover Greece\u2019s financing needs, reports Helena. \u201cNo financing solution could work in the context of the proposal of the institutions,\u201d one said. The same sources - reflecting similar statements made by senior officials in the governing Syriza party earlier today - said \u201cmany scenarios\u201d were now being considered. What was important, the sources said, was that an agreement did not \u201crecycle\u201d the vicious cycle of austerity. The Greek government has rejected a proposed five-month extension of the country\u2019s bailout accord, Helena Smith reports from Athens. Greek officials have turned down the deal. \u201cThe text that was given to the Greek side is worse than the memorandum,\u201d one was quoted as saying by the Athens news agency. Government sources have lashed out at the \u201cunacceptable\u201d tactics employed by interlocutors representing foreign lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF. There are reports, says Helena, that prime minister Alexis Tsipras is making a speedy return to Athens. If you are just joining us and wondering what is happening tomorrow and why it matters for Greece, for the eurozone and beyond, we have just published this Q&amp;A on the Eurogroup meeting. As EU policymakers have been stressing, time really does appear to be running out for Greece and its creditors to reach a deal. Then again, we have been here a few times before and already today there has been talk of extending Greece\u2019s bailout again. Saturday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting has been brought forward by three hours to 2pm Brussels time (1pm BST). Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker have finally held their press conference. Here are the main points: European council head Tusk said there are three days left to strike a deal with Greece, and we are very close to the day when the game is over. Both struck a conciliatory tone, responding to earlier comments by Tsipras who accused creditors of \u201cblackmail and ultimatums\u201d. European Commission president Juncker denied that the eurozone had issued an ultimatum to Greece. Juncker also said that progress had been made in the debt talks, adding that there is a real chance of concluding an agreement. Juncker commented: \u201cTomorrow is a crucial day not only for Greece but also for the euro area as a whole. I am quite optimistic but not over optimistic.\u201d \u201cWe have made progress ... There is a real chance of concluding an agreement.\u201d Tusk said: \u201cIt is not political blackmail when we repeat day after day that we are very close to this day when the game is over ... This is fact.\u201d The credit ratings agency Fitch has issued a warning about the prolonged nature of the debt talks and \u201clasting damage\u201d to the Greek economy. It highlights the risk of Greece failing to make its bundled IMF payments on Tuesday as well as the risk of capital controls being introduced, espcially if the ECB pulls the plug on support for Greece\u2019s financial system. A note just published by the ratings agency says: The continuing talks between the Greek government and the country\u2019s official creditors are testament to the political will to secure an agreement, but the time-consuming and often confrontational nature of the discussions heightens key risks to the credit profile of the Greek sovereign and its banks.\u201d As for what missing the IMF payment means for Greece\u2019s already low credit rating, Fitch explains: Fitch\u2019s sovereign ratings reflect the risk of default to private rather than official sector creditors, so missing the IMF payment would not constitute a sovereign ratings default, but it would be credit negative. Arrears to the IMF by a high-income economy are unprecedented and would indicate extreme liquidity stress. Implications for Greece\u2019s sovereign rating would depend on the country\u2019s ability and willingness to cure the missed IMF payment, and the institutions\u2019 response. For example, if an outline deal were agreed or appeared imminent, it is possible that the European Central Bank would maintain Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) to Greece\u2019s banks. Without ELA, Fitch believes capital controls would likely be imposed. Even assuming a deal is struck, it is unlikely that Greece would regain market access by the end of an extended second programme. The struggle to agree tax and pension reforms, the heated rhetoric that has at times accompanied this week\u2019s discussions, and popular opposition to austerity in Greece, suggest that negotiating a third programme (or equivalent) will be challenging, with recurrent risks of a loss of trust between Greece and its official creditors. Prolonged uncertainty has done lasting damage to the Greek economy. The hit to investor, consumer, and depositor confidence could push the economy from stagnation to contraction (we forecast no growth this year).\u201d The Greek stock market is now up 1.1%. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac have reversed earlier falls are now trading 0.3% and 0.8% higher, respectively. The FTSE 100 index in London is still 0.45% lower, however. Tsipras has gone on the offensive, accusing Greece\u2019s creditors of \u201cblackmail\u201d \u2013 a day after Merkel said \u201cwe won\u2019t be blackmailed by Greece\u201d. The Greek prime minister told reporters after the EU summit: The European Union founding principles were democracy, solidarity, equality and mutual respect. It was not based on blackmail and ultimatums. No one has the right to put in danger these principles. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has been sharing his thoughts on the Greek crisis in an interview with Yahoo published today. Lew said on Greece: I hope they take this weekend seriously. The thing about the conversations around Greece that have been of concern to me is the number of deadlines, the number of times it\u2019s gotten right to the edge.\u201d \u201cThe risk of an accident goes up the more times you have these [situations, and] everyone rushes to a deadline. I hope they can reach an agreement that prevents Greece from going through the deep pain that a breakdown would cause, and it doesn\u2019t create risks to either the European or the global economy. This is not the time for a shock.\u201d News that the EU and IMF are now contemplating prolonging the country\u2019s bailout programme by another five months will land with the force of a bombshell in Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith reports. There are few who will welcome this news. Kicking the can that is the great Greek debt crisis down the road will not only fail to staunch the political uncertainty that has plagued the country, but have potentially devastating effects for the economy. The prominent political analyst Aristides Hatzis told the Guardian: It will be a major defeat for the government which has pushed for a comprehensive deal that could alleviate, once and for all, the negative consequences of this ongoing nightmare. Now we have another case of \u2018extend and pretend\u2019 which has been at the root of the saga for the last five years. It is like a bad soap opera.\u201d The leftist-led government had wanted a deal that would at least guarantee financing until the end of 2016 \u2013 what Euclid Tsakalotos described in an interview for this blog as a \u201cmid-term solution\u201d that would quash scenarios of Grexit, reignite investor interest in Greece and give the economy the time and space to economically recover. \u201cA short-term solution would be the worst of all,\u201d he told me. The news was quick to send shudders through the financial sector. \u201cWe will rot inside the euro zone,\u201d one banker said requesting anonymity. \u201cNobody wants this solution, it just prolongs the Greek drama.\u201d Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel has been giving a press conference in Brussels where Reuters quotes her as saying: We have taken a step towards Greece... Now it is up to the Greek side to take a similar step.\u201d German chancellor Angela Merkel has been again emphasising the make-or-break nature of this weekend\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, saying there are no plans to follow it up with a eurozone leaders summit. Reuters reports Merkel saying she and her French counterpart Fran\u00e7ois Hollande have urged Greek PM Alexis Tsipras to accept the \u201cgenerous offer\u201d from creditors and that after concessions from their side it is now up to Greece to take a step in the direction of its eurozone partners. It looks like a cash-for-reforms deal could be within grasp \u2013 finally. Ian Traynor reports from Brussels: Terms still to be finalised but eurozone sources say differences are now minimal \u2013 that the pension issue is resolved, lots of VAT issues are resolved and that the differences on VAT amount to a risible \u20ac107m \u2013 peanuts. Creditors are still demanding \u20ac400m in defence cuts, while Greece is proposing \u20ac200m. Privatisation arrangements on regional airports are also said to be basically agreed. An EU negotiating source said: \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to block agreement for so little.\u201d Another eurozone source said Tsipras has to get this through the Greek parliament on Sunday to secure the five-month extension before Tuesday. On the bailout extension, our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports that a two-page paper from troika creditors was given to eurozone finance ministers on Thursday. They still need to study it at Saturday\u2019s eurogroup meeting at 5 pm. It\u2019s \u20ac15.5bn bailout money in a five-month extension till the end of November \u2013 \u20ac8.7bn from the eurozone bailout fund, \u20ac3.3bn in SMP (ECB bond profits due to Greece) and \u20ac3.5bn from IMF. The final countdown: the fixed income research team at Deutsche Bank says: We continue to believe the most likely outcome is a deal that keeps Greece in the euro area. Time is running extremely short and the risk of accident rises as a consequence. One cannot rule out scenarios such as non-payment plus capital controls or even pre-emptive capital controls. A referendum may be called. The additional stress created through these scenarios may yet be required to create the political consensus to close the deal. Higher uncertainty is a risk but contagion should be more limited than it was 3-4 years ago. Financial institutions have markedly less exposure to Greece. Other peripherals have adjusted and are running current account surpluses. Their reliance of foreign investors has declined and private capital in these countries has been stable this year despite the exodus from Greece. Correlation between activity conditions in Greece and the rest of the euro area is down too and we are confident the ECB would if necessary act to reinforce its \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d reputation. A Staff Level Agreement is no panacea either. It depends on the details. If a recovery is heavily penalized by tough austerity, the fiscal adjustment risks being self-defeating. Not only might the fiscal targets prove elusive, but austerity and recession may push political support even further into the extremes, questioning the commitment to implementing the necessary reforms and hence the recovery in jobs and investment. There are also flashes on Reuters that Greece\u2019s international creditors are planning to extend the country\u2019s bailout by five months (to November), and release rescue funds of \u20ac15.5bn so Athens can pay back the IMF on Tuesday. The funds would include the \u20ac7.2bn Greece is owed from its current bailout package and \u20ac1.8bn from the ECB for profits it has made from Greek bonds. See our previous story here. Turning to Brexit: Sch\u00e4uble also wants the UK to stay in the European Union. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is speaking now. It\u2019s the usual hard talk. According to Reuters, he said the Greek economy cannot grow without sustainable public finances and if we kick the can down the road, the situation will just get worse. He criticised the Greek proposals for simply increasing taxes, without spending cuts. Greece is well aware of the benefits of staying in the euro, he said, and warned that if markets lose confidence in policymakers, the euro will fall apart. Over in Athens, Helena Smith reports that Greece has persistently called for a solution to be found at a higher, political level - so in effect the German chancellor has now quashed Tsipras\u2019 demand \u2013 returning the ball to the court of eurozone finance ministers. Merkel\u2019s cold shoulder is bound to further rile the Greek government following leaks that what is also being discussed is an extension of Greece\u2019s \u20ac240bn bailout programme and not a new comprehensive deal as Athens had wanted. A German finance ministry spokesman said the German negotiating team is heading to Brussels on Saturday with the goal of reaching a deal \u2013 and the ultimate goal is to keep Greece in the euro. \u201cWe are discussing a comprehensive package,\u201d said ministry spokesman Martin J\u00e4ger. Greece\u2019s international creditors have made compromises in talks with Athens and it is now up to the Greeks to move, he said. He also described the troika\u2019s offer as \u201cgenerous,\u201d as reported earlier. It is now very clear that it is up to the Greek side to make their contribution to a solution to the problem. Only then will there be a solution: the Greek government needs to move closer to the institutions and accept their generous offer. A German government spokeswoman said Merkel made clear that time is pressing on Greece. A deal must be struck by creditors and eurozone finance ministers, she said (thereby rejecting Greek calls for a eurozone leaders\u2019 summit). Over in Athens, talks between Tsipras, Merkel and Hollande have been concluded but may well continue again once the EU summit is over, Greek news outlets are reporting. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: a government statement, issued within minutes of the three-way meeting being held in the offices of the French delegation at the European Council, said: Alexis Tsipras informed the two leaders about the Greek proposal and emphasised that the Greek side did not understand why creditors were insisting on such hard measures. Negotiations will continue after the summit is concluded. The talks - the third of their kind in less than a month - were arranged late last night after Athens submitted another revised package of proposed reforms running eight pages long. Sticking points between the two remain pensions (Athens wants to raise the pension age to 67 in 2022 and not earlier) and value added tax, insiders say. The Greek government is adamant that VAT should not be increased on islands which have long been exempt from higher levies under EU treaty. Here\u2019s more on those private talks between Tsipras, Merkel and Hollande this morning, which lasted 45 minutes, courtesy of Reuters. A French source told the news agency: On the substance, the gap is not so wide. They discussed what has to be done today and tomorrow to conclude on issues still to be settled relating to reforms, the extension of the programme and the question of financing. Both Merkel and Hollande stressed that Saturday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting was the decisive moment in the negotiations and saw no need for another eurozone leaders\u2019 summit. If necessary, they will hold further talks with Tsipras before the finance ministers\u2019 meeting. While we are waiting, a German finance ministry spokesman just said the Greek government needs to \u201cmove\u201d in Saturday\u2019s negotiations. It is up to Greece to accept the \u201cvery generous\u201d offer from the creditors. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission will be holding a press conference soon. You can watch it live here. Tsipras, Merkel and Hollande discussed the possibility of extending Greece\u2019s bailout programme, according to Reuters, citing a French source. They had a private meeting before the final session of the EU leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels. And eurozone finance ministers are due to resume discussions on Saturday at 5pm Brussels time. Headlines flashing on Reuters: The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras he told the German and French leaders that Greece could not understand the lenders\u2019 insistence on tough measures. Talks will continue after the EU leaders\u2019 summit ends around midday on Friday. Reuters is reporting, citing a source, that the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council decided on Friday to keep its emergency liquidity assistance for Greek banks \u2013 a crucial cash lifeline for the country \u2013 unchanged at \u20ac89bn for a third day. The ECB previously increased the programme steadily over many weeks. Click here for more context. In other Greek news... Meanwhile, Greece\u2019s interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, has also been speaking. He told private ANT1 TV station: The outcome largely depends on the way our partner will face the Greek issue. If they insist on a clear accounting approach, then apparently pessimism will prevail, but if the European leaders understand that Greece\u2019s problem is part of the whole picture of the European problems in which unity is a prerequisite, there will be optimism over the outcome of the negotiations. In case of a failure to reach an agreement in the negotiations, both Greece and Europe will be found in unexplored waters. China says it is confident about the outcome of the Greece debt talks. Vice foreign minister Wang Chao told a news conference: We have full confidence in how that will progress. Chinia would like to see Greece remain in the eurozone and appreciates the relevant parties\u2019 efforts in this regard. We believe that the eurozone can, via the efforts of all parties, appropriately deal with the situation. And while we wait for more news from Brussels, here are some more thoughts on the sharp sell-off in the Shanghai stock market. Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets says there have been too many IPOs: Big losses on the Shanghai Composite index extend[ed] into Friday\u2019s session following tremendous Chinese market rumblings on Thursday. A blistering bull run on the Chinese mainland looks set to end in the arena that, for the animals themselves anyway, spells imminent demise. 2015\u2019s market mania (with the Shanghai Comp. gaining a massive150%) has seen countless funds piling into Chinese equities encouraged by vast valuations, IPOs aplenty, confidence in economic stimulus and an explosion in margin-supported trading. There\u2019ve been too many IPOs, lenders are freaking out (tightening margin rates as a consequence), lofty valuations are being called into question and that ever elusive stimulus remains to be rolled out in any meaningful way. It\u2019s like rats leaving a sinking ship, and a terrible day for any investment trust dedicated entirely to long-term investments in mainland China. Here\u2019s Mike van Dulken again, head of research at Accendo Markets, on the likelihood of a relief rally on Monday. Equities in the red accelerating their sell-off from late yesterday as we move into what is being billed as the last weekend for Greece to present acceptable reforms to its creditors to unlock the bailout-avoiding funds it desperately requires. While another last-minute weekend agreement would surely mean a relief rally come Monday, continued stubbornness on both sides could equally take us into uncharted default/euro-exit territory and the accompanying uncertainty send markets lower. Gold continues to languish around $1170, failing to benefit from safe haven demand despite Greece being on the cup of default. Helena Smith in Athens reports that Tsipras has been in talks with the German and French leaders for about 25 minutes. People have been rushing to withdraw money from Greek banks, even before the dramatic events of the last fortnight. Deposits at Greek banks fell to their lowest level in almost 11 years in May, dropping nearly \u00a33.7bn to \u00a3135.7bn, according to data from the European Central Bank. The Italian and Lithuanian leaders have both expressed their confidence that a Greece deal will be struck on Saturday, at the crunchiest of crunch talks. Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, said when he emerged from the European Council: We support the efforts of Alexis Tsipras and his government to reach an agreement with the European institutions. At the same time, we are aware of how important it is for everyone that Greece remains in the eurozone. I estimate that Saturday is the final day and I am certain that we can reach an agreement. Tsipras is on his way to talks with his German and French counterparts, media are reporting in Athens. Helena Smith writes: The far left leader is on his way to the European Council, SKAI TV is reporting. Tsipras has repeatedly placed hopes in striking a deal at a higher level, bypassing euro group finance ministers who officials in Athens claim have been constantly stonewalled by Berlin\u2019s unyielding, pro-austerity finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Speaking to Skai, Stelios Koulouglou, a euro MP with the ruling Syriza party, said the Greek government was still placing hopes in a \u201cpolitical\u201d deal being reached. There is an ongoing effort to clinch an agreement at a higher political level because further down there is the faction of Schauble who blocks [resolution]. The three politicians are still in Brussels for the regular summit of European Union leaders. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, is to hold talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on Friday, Reuters reports, citing a Greek government official. The Financial Times reports EU officials are preparing plans to \u201cringfence\u201d Greece if talks fail on Saturday, including capital controls. You can listen to the Varoufakis interview on Morning Ireland here. Here are Varoufakis\u2019 comments in full, from his interview with Irish national radio RTE this morning. The Greek finance minister said that while Greece was determined to stay in the eurozone, Athens would not sign an agreement with lenders that it considered \u201cunviable\u201d. I am against increasing the corporate tax, but then again I am against raising the tax on hotels and against cutting the pensions of people who live below the poverty line. These issues are putting me and my government in an impossible position, having to make a bad choice among really hard, difficult bad choices. Asked whether Greece was still facing demands that he could not agree to, he said: \u201cabsolutely, absolutely\u201d. The Greek side has bent over backwards to accommodate some rather strange demands by the institutions. It is now up to them to come to the party. He said the austerity package being imposed on Greece would destroy its chances of a return to growth and make it much harder to repay its debts. So when I am asked to put my signature at the bottom line of an agreement which is clearly unviable, I am not going to do this. Over in Athens this morning the mood appears to have shifted yet again, reports our correspondent Helena Smith. Last night, it was optimism that ultimately reigned with senior officials in Greece\u2019s governing Syriza party expressing the hope that a cash-for-reform deal was ultimately in sight. The radical left party\u2019s prominent MEP, Dimitris Stratoulis, told the Guardian from Brussels. There is a detectable shift in stance. Under pressure lenders have retreated on several issues. This morning, grave doubts were being expressed as to whether a deal was possible at all. Panos Skourletis, the labour minister who is in close contact with prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Brussels, told Mega TV: On the basis of what things look like today the possibilities of an agreement are slim. Every time a solution is almost found and there is convergence, they come and say \u201cbring us a few more pensioners to execute.\u201d What they are asking right now is tantamount to the suicide of an entire people. The politician, reflecting what is clearly the latest thinking in Syriza, did not rule out fresh elections, or a referendum, if the impasse could not be broken. \u201cIf dilemmas occur that are outside the democratic mandate that we have been given, we will once again resort to the people,\u201d he said, adding he did not rule out some king of extension being given and negotiations restarting later in the year. \u201cI don\u2019t exclude that either,\u201d he added. More thoughts on Greece. Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FxPro, says: Another day passes with no deal on Greece and investors are likely to want to position themselves for negotiations to go on into the weekend by reducing exposure to risk assets. Indices are a little softer on the open and the euro is offered as we see yet another classic situation when it comes to the eurozone with things going down to the wire. Investors however remain optimistic that a deal will be struck ahead of next week\u2019s IMF payment deadline throwing Greece yet another lifeline. If the expected deal does come over the weekend then investors will not be able to react until Monday and there could be disappointment if Greece is afforded just the extension to its existing bailout which will only fund the country through the summer. The political will that has so far kept the eurozone intact is being tested more than it has ever been before and is likely to be further. It\u2019s just a question of whether politicians and in particular Greece\u2019s creditors have the staying power. Whose round is it in the last chance saloon? ask Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets. While we might berate Greece for stringing things out, why wouldn\u2019t it do so until the last minute? Again. It knows exactly what the other side wants and can simply agree to just in the nick of time. Again. Until then, you never know what the purse-string-holders might concede, improving the final deal. The only risk is whether Greek depositors are prepared to hold out too. If they exit en masse they could force Tsipras\u2019 and Syriza\u2019s hand in terms of potential financial collapse. European stock markets are down this morning, as expected. The Athens market has lost 0.9% in early trading. The FTSE 100 index in London has lost more than 40 points, or 0.6%, to 6767.40. The Dax in Frankfurt has slid 0.5% to 11416.55, and the CAC 40 in Paris is 0.7% lower at 5007.61. The Ibex in Madrid has fallen 0.7% to 11250.30 while the FTSE MiB in Milan is down 0.5% at 23,534.17. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Canadian foreign exchange firm OANDA, said: By the time the markets reopen next week, Greece may have either secured a deal or accepted default to the IMF. With all this in mind, I expect to see significant risk aversion this morning with investors preparing for fireworks over the weekend. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, claimed this morning that his country had done everything it could to accommodate the \u201cstrange demands\u201d made by its creditors, and was determined to remain in the eurozone. However, Athens is still facing demands from its creditors that it cannot agree to, he said in an interview with Irish national radio RTE. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has admitted that long hours of negotiations on Greece could be counter-productive. We cannot take the right decisions when we are tired. He made the comment in a joint press conference with European Council president Donald Tusk, after the EU leaders\u2019 summit drew to a close in the early hours. Tusk said he briefed EU leaders on the negotiations. He saw no need for a eurozone summit on the Greek issue, urging politicians to hammer out a deal at Saturday\u2019s eurozone finance ministers\u2019 meeting (Eurogroup). Bernard Aw, market strategist at trading firm IG, said the \u201ccorrection\u201d in the Shanghai stock market is healthy in the long run, and China\u2019s central bank wants the market to be more stable. It is probably not a bad idea to repeat my view that China\u2019s leaders still view a strong capital market as beneficial for the Chinese economy, more importantly, a stable bull market is desired. In Asia, stock markets sold off after another black Friday in China. The Shanghai stock market tumbled nearly 8%, dragging down other markets. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng lost almost 2% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei was more resilient, dipping 0.3%. The Shanghai Composite has surged 124% over the past year and analysts believe its 935 day bull run has peaked, amid rising uncertainty about whether the government will continue to ease policy to boost the economy. Jonathan Garner, the head of Asia and emerging-market strategy at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said: This is probably not a dip to buy. In fact, we think the balance of probabilities is that the top for the cycle on Shanghai, Shenzhen and the ChiNext has now taken place. Meanwhile, Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: German chancellor Angela Merkel has said Saturday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting would be of \u201cdecisive importance.\u201d Perhaps a wider concern for markets is that each day the institutions lose more credibility when these arbitrary \u201cfinal\u201d deadlines gets missed. It doesn\u2019t look too hopeful that an agreement will be reached on Saturday. Pensions are still a sticking point that neither side wishes to give into. That said, nobody wants to be left holding the smoking gun of Greece\u2019s default and exit from the euro. It seems likely that another arbitrary extension date will emerge before June 30, when Greece\u2019s current bailout runs out. Good morning and welcome back to our coverage of the eurozone (Greece) debt crisis and other economic developments. Following Thursday\u2019s 24-hour negotiating marathon, European politicians will be working frantically on a deal between Greece and its international creditors, before talks between eurozone finance ministers resume on Saturday. Billed as \u201clast ditch\u201d talks (yet again) these weekend discussions will be crucial, as Athens has to make a \u20ac1.6bn payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday. Speaking after a meeting of European leaders broke up in the early hours of Friday morning, German chancellor Angela Merkel said the Saturday eurogroup meeting \u201cwill be decisive because time is of the essence\u201d. Every member of the European Council [EU leaders] strongly supported that every effort has to be made to bring about a solution. Investment bank JP Morgan believes that if no deal is reached by Sunday night, banks in Greece will stay closed on Monday.",

It highlights the risk of Greece failing to make its bundled IMF payments on Tuesday as well as the risk of capital controls being introduced, espcially if the ECB pulls the plug on support for Greece\u2019s financial system. </p> <p>A note just published by the ratings agency says: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The continuing talks between the Greek government and the country\u2019s official creditors are testament to the political will to secure an agreement, but the time-consuming and often confrontational nature of the discussions heightens key risks to the credit profile of the Greek sovereign and its banks.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>As for what missing the IMF payment means for Greece\u2019s already low credit rating, Fitch explains:<br><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <blockquote> <p>Fitch\u2019s sovereign ratings reflect the risk of default to private rather than official sector creditors, so missing the IMF payment would not constitute a sovereign ratings default, but it would be credit negative. Arrears to the IMF by a high-income economy are unprecedented and would indicate extreme liquidity stress. </p> <p>Implications for Greece\u2019s sovereign rating would depend on the country\u2019s ability and willingness to cure the missed IMF payment, and the institutions\u2019 response. For example, if an outline deal were agreed or appeared imminent, it is possible that the European Central Bank would maintain Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) to Greece\u2019s banks. Without ELA, Fitch believes capital controls would likely be imposed.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Even assuming a deal is struck, it is unlikely that Greece would regain market access by the end of an extended second programme. The struggle to agree tax and pension reforms, the heated rhetoric that has at times accompanied this week\u2019s discussions, and popular opposition to austerity in Greece, suggest that negotiating a third programme (or equivalent) will be challenging, with recurrent risks of a loss of trust between Greece and its official creditors.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Prolonged uncertainty has done lasting damage to the Greek economy. The hit to investor, consumer, and depositor confidence could push the economy from stagnation to contraction (we forecast no growth this year).\u201d</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T14:19:51.363Z\">at 3.19pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-558d53b9e4b0ec49dbd1f5dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T13:34:56.685Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Greek stock market is now up 1.1%.

Time is running extremely short and the risk of accident rises as a consequence. One cannot rule out scenarios such as non-payment plus capital controls or even pre-emptive capital controls. A referendum may be called. The additional stress created through these scenarios may yet be required to create the political consensus to close the deal.</p> <p>Higher uncertainty is a risk but contagion should be more limited than it was 3-4 years ago. Financial institutions have markedly less exposure to Greece. Other peripherals have adjusted and are running current account surpluses. Their reliance of foreign investors has declined and private capital in these countries has been stable this year despite the exodus from Greece. Correlation between activity conditions in Greece and the rest of the euro area is down too and we are confident the ECB would if necessary act to reinforce its \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d reputation.</p> <p>A Staff Level Agreement is no panacea either. It depends on the details. If a recovery is heavily penalized by tough austerity, the fiscal adjustment risks being self-defeating. Not only might the fiscal targets prove elusive, but austerity and recession may push political support even further into the extremes, questioning the commitment to implementing the necessary reforms and hence the recovery in jobs and investment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-558d36ade4b003b03c641730\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T11:36:54.225Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Creditors plan to extend Greece bailout by five months and disburse \u20ac15.5bn \u2013 Reuters</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are also flashes on Reuters that Greece\u2019s international creditors are planning to extend the country\u2019s bailout by five months (to November), and release rescue funds of \u20ac15.5bn so Athens can pay back the IMF on Tuesday. </p> <p>The funds would include the \u20ac7.2bn Greece is owed from its current bailout package and \u20ac1.8bn from the ECB for profits it has made from Greek bonds. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/21/greece-crisis-creditors-aim-deal-six-month-rescue-extension\">See our previous story here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T11:54:11.107Z\">at 12.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-558d34d3e4b003b03c641724\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T11:18:01.366Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turning to Brexit: Sch\u00e4uble also wants the UK to stay in the European Union.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-558d339be4b003b03c64171f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T11:17:23.944Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is speaking now.

Indices are a little softer on the open and the euro is offered as we see yet another classic situation when it comes to the eurozone with things going down to the wire. Investors however remain optimistic that a deal will be struck ahead of next week\u2019s IMF payment deadline throwing Greece yet another lifeline.</p> <p><strong>If the expected deal does come over the weekend then investors will not be able to react until Monday and there could be disappointment if Greece is afforded just the extension to its existing bailout which will only fund the country through the summer. The political will that has so far kept the eurozone intact is being tested more than it has ever been before and is likely to be further.

Until then, you never know what the purse-string-holders might concede, improving the final deal. The only risk is whether Greek depositors are prepared to hold out too.

      "bodyText": "Eurozone finance ministers and Greece\u2019s creditors are to draw up emergency measures on Saturday to cope with a default by the debt-ridden country unless the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accepts the creditors\u2019 terms for a five-month extension of Athens\u2019 bailout. Greece has its last chance to bow to the lenders\u2019 terms following five months of stalemate at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on Saturday afternoon, the fifth such session in 10 days. Fearing a financial implosion and social unrest in the event of the negotiations collapsing, the ministers are scheduled to draw up plans on Saturday that could involve Greece imposing capital controls, including curbs on ATM withdrawals, to stem a flood of funds out of the ailing Greek financial system. \u201cGame over\u201d, said senior EU officials engaged in back-to-back meetings and negotiations for the past 10 days, as the brinkmanship in the Greek negotiations reached breaking point. If no deal is agreed at the weekend, Greece will miss a \u20ac1.6bn payment due to the International Monetary Fund next Tuesday, along with access to emergency support from the European Central Bank that is keeping the Greek banking system afloat. The creditors have prepared a new funding offer, providing a lifeline to keep Greece afloat until the end of November by extending the bailout by five months and supplying \u20ac15.5bn (\u00a311bn) in loans tied to budget cuts and tax rises. As a two-day EU leaders\u2019 summit ended in Brussels on Friday, several senior officials said Tsipras had to make a choice between accepting the creditors\u2019 ultimatum or embarking on a road that could take Greece out of the euro. The chances of saving Greece were put at 50-50. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who talked privately with the Greek leader in Brussels on Friday morning, urged him to go the \u201cextra step\u201d and accept what she described as \u201ca very generous offer\u201d. She ruled out any more emergency summits on the Greek crisis and delivered a pointed message to Tsipras by stressing how, during the Cyprus bailout two years ago, Cypriot banks had to be closed \u201cfor a few days\u201d, forcing the political leaders to come to Brussels to deal with the creditor institutions and the Eurogroup finance ministers in order to resolve the issue. The ECB is keeping Greek banks on life support by providing \u20ac89bn worth of emergency funding, which is being topped up to keep pace with deposit withdrawals that hit more than \u20ac4bn last week alone. The rejectionist hard line from Greece resounded loudly in Brussels on Friday as Tsipras flew home to a weekend of volatile and probably uproarious politics. In public, he sounded the note of no compromise. \u201cThe European Union founding principles were democracy, solidarity, equality and mutual respect. It was not based on blackmail and ultimatums. No one has the right to put in danger these principles,\u201d he declared. The Greek labour minister, Panos Skourletis, said: \u201cWe have moved from a take-it-or-leave-it scenario to the proposal of a five-month extension that makes no sense.\u201d Tsipras called an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens on Friday evening. \u201cNothing is moving, neither side is budging,\u201d said an EU source of thenegotiations going on behind the scenes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a deal because no one here believes the Greeks any more. No one trusts them.\u201d But other sources said there was now little in fiscal and budgetary terms dividing both sides and that the problem was more political than financial. \u201cThe differences are very slight,\u201d said another official. On the nitty-gritty of fiscal targets, spending plans and cuts, tax increases and economic reforms, both sides were said to be closer than before. On VAT rates and and taxable products, for example, there was only a gap of \u20ac107m between the sides. Privatisation and pension reform issues had been essentially settled, while the creditors were still demanding a doubling of defence budget cuts to \u20ac400m. Tsipras has consistently maintained that the dispute is about politics more than money and can only be settled at the highest political levels. This has failed in two EU summits this week. He now faces the political choice of buckling or defying the creditors. \u201cI am not very optimistic,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, who has racked up at least 15 hours of negotiations with Tsipras this week. The two-page paper on extending the bailout includes a footnote referring to the issue of debt sustainability, allowing the interpretation that the eurozone could eventually accede to a form of debt relief for Greece, which is Tsipras\u2019s primary demand. But any debt restructuring or rescheduling action would come with strings attached and would be the subject of later tough negotiations. The deal that may or may not be struck on Saturday wouldtherefore buy time for both sides without tackling core issues. On Friday evening, EU officials said Tsipras had about 20 hours to make up his mind. If he capitulates, he would need to rush budget legislation through the Greek parliament on Sunday to allow the German parliament to endorse the package on Monday before it expires on Tuesday. \u201cOtherwise he won\u2019t get the extension,\u201d said an official. Teams of financial negotiators are to meet in Brussels on Saturday morning before the finance ministers\u2019 meeting.",

      "bodyText": "When Arthur Lasenby Liberty laid plans for the London department store that still bears his name, his dream was to metaphorically dock a ship in the streets of London laden with luxuries from the four corners of the British empire. Having founded the business in 1875, he died before seeing the store in its current location built in 1924. Liberty on Great Marlborough Street was constructed from the timbers of two Royal Navy vessels \u2013 HMS Impregnable and HMS Hindustan \u2013 and it transported customers to a world of exotic fabrics, ornaments and art imported from around the world. Nine decades later, the good ship Liberty is to set sail overseas \u2013 taking its own-label merchandise to department stores in the US and Italy. It is also seeking a whole array of partnerships to build on successful tie-ups with Nike, Barbour and US department store Saks Fifth Avenue. The overseas adventure is intended to underpin a plan to float on the London Stock Exchange in 2018, taking Liberty back into public ownership. The retailer was bought by private equity firm BlueGem for \u00a332m in 2010. From next month, US fashion retailer Nordstrom will host pop-up shops featuring Flowers of Liberty homewares in six of its US stores, including New York, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington. Meanwhile, La Rinascente in Milan will feature a pop-up for Liberty London, the retailer\u2019s colourful handbag and accessories range, from this autumn. A deal with a second US department store is also on the cards. The aim is to use Liberty\u2019s own label to build the London icon into an international brand by cutting exclusive agreements with high-end department stores around the world. Standing in the wood-panelled meeting room made from the captain\u2019s quarters of one of the ships, Marco Capello, the former Merrill Lynch banker who heads BlueGem, says Liberty has been totally transformed from the days when it was mired in losses and selling off property to raise cash. The company, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange but controlled by property company MWB Group, had been losing money for years. The retailer was making sales of around \u00a370m but losses were \u00a34.5m in 2009. \u201cEverybody thought I was mad and Liberty could never be profitable. I disagreed \u2026 I sat in the cafe for three days and I saw a lot of people coming in and very few coming out with big shopping bags. I thought: \u2018The merchandise is not right.\u2019 I thought: \u2018There is something we can do,\u2019\u201d says Capello. The sharp-suited and enthusiastic boss\u2019s plan to turn around Liberty hinged on a number of basics \u2013 cutting costs by ditching the culture of big executive offices, trimming the number of staff, changing the merchandise and incentivising staff based on individual sales performance. The captain\u2019s room is now used for hosting VIP guests and staff meetings; Capello works from a cupboard-like white room. A key first move was the promotion of American Ed Burstell \u2013 now Liberty\u2019s managing director, who is well known to watchers of the Channel 4 documentary on the life of the department store. Capello refers to him as Leonardo, after the artist and inventor \u2013 \u201cHe is probably the best buyer in the world. I respect him very much,\u201d says Capello. Burstell masterminded changes to the set-up of Liberty\u2019s impressive central atrium, where shoppers were being scared off by very expensive products. Handbags costing more than \u00a31,000 were not easy for tourists to tuck into their luggage. Today, Liberty is far from cheap, but its luxurious wallets, purses and handbags are at least more within reach of ordinary folk, with patterned purses starting at \u00a365. Takings from the atrium have shot up from just \u00a31,500 a day in 2010 to \u00a340,000 now. In the year to January 2014, sales were \u00a3123m and the company made \u00a318m of underlying profits. Last year, profit rose to \u00a321.5m and sales were up to \u00a3132m. In the coming year, the company is aiming for sales close to \u00a3155m. \u201cWe think this is a fabulous business and it has got a lot more legs. It\u2019s a rare jewel in the crown and I\u2019d like to own it for 20 years,\u201d says Capello. Under BlueGem\u2019s agreement with its investors, the business would have been sold last year. Instead, BlueGem refinanced, allowing some investors to take cash out but nearly all to re-invest in buying the department store for \u00a3165m. Capello himself remortgaged his home to secure a 9% stake. Other BlueGem and Liberty management executives share 3% more. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to float the company in three years\u2019 time and then the fund will be able to realise a substantial gain,\u201d says Capello. However, Liberty still has substantial debts for its size \u2013 ending last year with debts of \u00a353m after about \u00a320m of investment by BlueGem since it bought the business. Because of this, a flotation is likely to hinge on successful expansion overseas. It\u2019s a strategy that Liberty has tried before. In 2007, the Liberty of London collection went into international department stores, including America\u2019s Bloomingdale\u2019s, and in 2010 the floral print featured in an exclusive range for the US Target chain. A standalone Liberty of London store opened on London\u2019s Sloane Street. But the small store closed after just a year and Capello says Liberty stopped wholesaling own-label product five years ago. Since then, Liberty\u2019s main overseas presence has been via an offshoot in Japan that sells Liberty-branded products in major stores. The company also wholesales its famous printed fabrics around the world and works through brand partnerships with the likes of Nike. Capello believes the latest effort will be much more significant. Firstly, he has just hired Jose Vaz Guedes, the former worldwide commercial director for Jimmy Choo, to lead overseas expansion. And Capello says Liberty\u2019s two own labels, Liberty Flowers and Liberty London, have been tried and tested in the London store and take two to three times the sales per square foot of any other department. \u201cWe have tested the products for over a year and the results show people really love them,\u201d he says. \u201cLast time, Liberty expanded across various accounts at the same time. By origin, I\u2019m a peasant, so I\u2019m very cautious.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Arthur Lasenby Liberty laid plans for the London department store that still bears his name, his dream was to metaphorically dock a ship in the streets of London laden with luxuries from the four corners of the British empire. </p> <p>Having founded the business in 1875, he died before seeing the store in its current location built in 1924. Liberty on Great Marlborough Street was constructed from the timbers of two Royal Navy vessels \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/hms_impregnable.htm\">HMS Impregnable</a> and <a href=\"http://insideology.com/2011/04/29/buildings-that-are-made-from-ships/\">HMS Hindustan</a> \u2013 and it transported customers to a world of exotic fabrics, ornaments and art imported from around the world.</p> <p>Nine decades later, the good ship Liberty is to set sail overseas \u2013 taking its own-label merchandise to department stores in the US and Italy. It is also seeking a whole array of partnerships to build on successful tie-ups with Nike, Barbour and US department store <a href=\"http://hotspots360.com/city/saks-fifth-avenue/\">Saks Fifth Avenue</a>.</p> <p> The overseas adventure is intended to underpin a plan to float on the London Stock Exchange in 2018, taking Liberty back into public ownership. The retailer was bought by private equity firm <a href=\"http://www.bluegemcp.com/\">BlueGem</a> for \u00a332m in 2010.</p> <p>From next month, US fashion retailer Nordstrom will host pop-up shops featuring Flowers of Liberty homewares in six of its US stores, including New York, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://expo2015-italiano-milano.com/shopping-in-milan/\">La Rinascente</a> in Milan will feature a pop-up for Liberty London, the retailer\u2019s colourful handbag and accessories range, from this autumn. A deal with a second US department store is also on the cards.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d71b6667a1ebf4f5e38e5b69826650697ba334cd\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435339470863/ecacc0ee-c748-48d9-91aa-1260d665856c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Liberty shop front.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liberty was built in 1924 from the timbers of two ships.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Moore / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The aim is to use Liberty\u2019s own label to build the London icon into an international brand by cutting exclusive agreements with high-end department stores around the world.</p> <p>Standing in the wood-panelled meeting room made from the captain\u2019s quarters of one of the ships, <a href=\"http://www.bluegemcp.com/our-people/marco-capello\">Marco Capello</a>, the former Merrill Lynch banker who heads BlueGem, says Liberty has been totally transformed from the days when it was mired in losses and selling off property to raise cash.</p> <p> The company, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange but controlled by property company <a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/business/companies/33911/mwb-group-holdings\">MWB Group</a>, had been losing money for years. The retailer was making sales of around \u00a370m but losses were \u00a34.5m in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody thought I was mad and Liberty could never be profitable. I disagreed \u2026 I sat in the cafe for three days and I saw a lot of people coming in and very few coming out with big shopping bags. I thought: \u2018The merchandise is not right.\u2019 I thought: \u2018There is something we can do,\u2019\u201d says Capello.<br></p> <p>The sharp-suited and enthusiastic boss\u2019s plan to turn around Liberty hinged on a number of basics \u2013 cutting costs by ditching the culture of big executive offices, trimming the number of staff, changing the merchandise and incentivising staff based on individual sales performance. The captain\u2019s room is now used for hosting VIP guests and staff meetings; Capello works from a cupboard-like white room.</p> <p>A key first move was the promotion of American <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2014/11/19/liberty-of-london-tv-show-ed-burstell-christmas-tour\">Ed Burstell</a> \u2013 now Liberty\u2019s managing director, who is well known to watchers of the Channel 4 documentary on the life of the department store. Capello refers to him as Leonardo, after the artist and inventor \u2013 \u201cHe is probably the best buyer in the world. I respect him very much,\u201d says Capello.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"225d290e3f8cbe6cdf50be253c52de782edfb6df\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435339945031/c757b7bd-9ee6-4757-b5f8-c00a3ee01d2c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Managing director Ed Burstell with glassmaker Charlotte Sale.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Managing director Ed Burstell with glassmaker Charlotte Sale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of BBC/Maverick TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burstell masterminded changes to the set-up of Liberty\u2019s impressive central atrium, where shoppers were being scared off by very expensive products. Handbags costing more than \u00a31,000 were not easy for tourists to tuck into their luggage.</p> <p>Today, Liberty is far from cheap, but its luxurious wallets, purses and handbags are at least more within reach of ordinary folk, with patterned purses starting at \u00a365. Takings from the atrium have shot up from just \u00a31,500 a day in 2010 to \u00a340,000 now.<br></p> <p>In the year to January 2014, sales were \u00a3123m and the company made \u00a318m of underlying profits. Last year, profit rose to \u00a321.5m and sales were up to \u00a3132m. In the coming year, the company is aiming for sales close to \u00a3155m.</p> <p>\u201cWe think this is a fabulous business and it has got a lot more legs. It\u2019s a rare jewel in the crown and I\u2019d like to own it for 20 years,\u201d says Capello.<br></p> <p>Under BlueGem\u2019s agreement with its investors, the business would have been sold last year.</p> <p>Instead, BlueGem refinanced, allowing some investors to take cash out but nearly all to re-invest in buying the department store for \u00a3165m. Capello himself remortgaged his home to secure a 9% stake. Other BlueGem and Liberty management executives share 3% more.</p> <p> \u201cOur ultimate goal is to float the company in three years\u2019 time and then the fund will be able to realise a substantial gain,\u201d says Capello. </p> <p>However, Liberty still has substantial debts for its size \u2013 ending last year with debts of \u00a353m after about \u00a320m of investment by BlueGem since it bought the business. Because of this, a flotation is likely to hinge on successful expansion overseas. </p> <p>It\u2019s a strategy that Liberty has tried before. In 2007, the Liberty of London collection went into international department stores, including America\u2019s <a href=\"http://unionsquareshop.com/pages/bloomingdales.html\">Bloomingdale\u2019s</a>, and in 2010 the floral print featured in an exclusive range for the US Target chain. A standalone Liberty of London store opened on London\u2019s Sloane Street. But the small store closed after just a year and Capello says Liberty stopped wholesaling own-label product five years ago.</p> <p>Since then, Liberty\u2019s main overseas presence has been via an offshoot in Japan that sells Liberty-branded products in major stores. The company also wholesales its famous printed fabrics around the world and works through brand partnerships with the likes of Nike.</p> <p>Capello believes the latest effort will be much more significant. Firstly, he has just hired Jose Vaz Guedes, the former worldwide commercial director for Jimmy Choo, to lead overseas expansion. And Capello says Liberty\u2019s two own labels, Liberty Flowers and Liberty London, have been tried and tested in the London store and take two to three times the sales per square foot of any other department.</p> <p>\u201cWe have tested the products for over a year and the results show people really love them,\u201d he says. \u201cLast time, Liberty expanded across various accounts at the same time. By origin, I\u2019m a peasant, so I\u2019m very cautious.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Chinese stock markets plunged on Friday as investors rushed to sell over fears that frenzied buying in recent months had sent share prices to unsustainable levels. The Shanghai composite index, which reached a post-crash record of 5,166 earlier this month, has since lost nearly 1,000 points, down more than 7% at the last session to 4,193. The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell 7.9%. The mass sell-off comes after six months of soaring share prices that saw the Shanghai composite more than double its value since the beginning of the year. Analysts said rocketing share values on China\u2019s main stock markets, including Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, were the result of a switch away from property investment following a clampdown by the government on excessive lending by banks. Laws liberalising the stock market also made it easier for funds to invest and for firms to offer shares to the public for the first time. The last six months have seen a record number of businesses listed on the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges. According to Reuters data, in the first two weeks of this month around 1.4 million new investors a week flocked to the stock market, helping pump up prices. Diana Choyleva, a renowned China analyst at Lombard Street Research, said Beijing viewed a stock market bubble as preferable to a housing market bubble. The authorities have clamped down on lending to property developers and households keen to get on the property ladder to prevent an already soaring market getting out of control. \u201cProperty price inflation is more dangerous because it is socially divisive, increasing the wealth of the rich while making it even harder for the less fortunate to clamber onto the property ladder,\u201d she said. China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, intervened to say the economy\u2019s fundamentals were good and major indicators were improving. He told the state-owned China Central Television that the cooling property sector had slowed growth, but \u201cthe main economic indicators such as industrial output, investment, consumption, exports and imports have stabilised and showed improvements since May.\u201d Further falls in China stocks are expected to send ripples throughout Asian markets, according to the investment advisor Rivkin. Investors fear another mass sell-off if eurozone negotiators fail to reach a deal with Greece. Capital Economics said the slide could knock 1 percentage point off China\u2019s GDP, which Choyleva estimates is around half the official measure of 7%. \u201cTraders and investors are very much on tenterhooks on the outcome [of talks on Greece],\u201d Ben Le Brun, a market analyst at OptionsXpress in Sydney, told Reuters. Markets are expected to get a boost next week when new rules come into force allowing funds that invest in mainland markets to trade more easily in Hong Kong. The integration of Chinese markets is expected to trigger a steady flow of investments into both markets, easing the pressure from the recent falls. \u201cWhen mainland investors invest offshore, they will not buy something that is totally alien to them, but Chinese equities whose names they are familiar with,\u201d said Franco Ngan, the chief executive officer at Zeal Asset Management in Hong Kong. It is also a good time to invest in Hong Kong stocks as H-shares are at deep discounts to China\u2019s A-shares, said Ngan, whose firm has a $300m Greater China equity fund that will apply for mutual recognition in July.",

It is not the first time Bank officials have intervened on the subject of climate change and its impact on businesses. Paul Fisher, the deputy head of its regulatory arm, said in March that insurance companies could be hit if their investments in fossil fuels ended up being worthless. He described such assets as potentially \u201cstranded\u201d if policy changes limited the use of fossil fuels. At a World Bank meeting a year ago, Carney said the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves may be unburnable if the world was to limit temperature rises to 2C. Such restrictions could send shockwaves through the financial markets. Carney, speaking at a conference on inclusive capitalism, said investors needed information on carbon footprints to make judgments about companies. A year ago, Carney told delegates at the same conference that capitalism risked destroying itself unless bankers realised they had an obligation to create a fairer society. He developed his thoughts on cleaning up City behaviour in his Mansion House speech this month when he said the \u201cage of irresponsibility\u201d was coming to end. He called for maximum jail terms for market abuse to be raised to 10 years from seven, and the offence widened to include foreign exchange and bond markets. He told his audience on Friday: \u201cLondon has a responsibility to lead if the age of irresponsibility is over. London is about markets. This is about London stepping up.\u201d The Bank is holding an open forum in the autumn to discuss the changes to the regulation of foreign exchange and bond markets, in which meddling has led to a wave of fines since the 2008 financial crisis. While firms had been hit with fines totalling $150bn (\u00a396bn) since the crisis, individuals have got away relatively scot-free, Carney said. \u201cA lot of people in these markets didn\u2019t really know, and probably still do not know, what is expected of them because it hasn\u2019t been adequately defined in everyday language,\u201d he said. The industry is in the process, of drawing up a new code of conduct, overseen by the Bank, intended to change that. Carney said markets could only grow if they had a social licence to do so. \u201cThese markets will not sustain themselves unless they have integrity,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s international creditors have said they are close to a deal that would unlock \u20ac15.5bn (\u00a310.9bn) in rescue funds for the debt-laden country, despite signs of hardening political opposition in Athens as Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras accused lenders of \u201cblackmail\u201d. Greece\u2019s creditors \u2013 the European commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund \u2013 are ready to offer the nearly-bankrupt nation \u20ac15.5bn in bailout funds in a five-month extension of the bailout until the end of November. One EU source said the two sides were 90% of the way to a deal which would involve spending cuts in exchange for financial assistance. Disagreements over pension spending have been resolved and differences over VAT reforms have almost been squared. However, Tsipras left an EU leaders\u2019 summit with harsh words for the creditors\u2019 offer, while members of his government slammed the prospect of a bailout extension back in Athens. \u201cThe European Union\u2019s founding principles were democracy, solidarity, equality and mutual respect. It was not based on blackmail and ultimatums,\u201d said Tsipras. The Greek labour minister, Panos Skourletis, said: \u201cWe have moved from a take-it-or-leave-it scenario to the proposal of a five-month extension that makes no sense.\u201d The German chancellor Angela Merkel said Greece had been made \u201ca very generous offer\u201d by the creditor institutions. \u201cWe have taken a step,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe it is not time for Greece to make a similar step in our direction.\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, dismissed Tsipras\u2019s accusations of blackmail. \u201cThe position of the institutions is not a take-it-or-leave it [deal],\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not European not to listen to the others,\u201d he said in an apparent dig at Tsipras. But EU sources sounded confident that they were getting close to agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to block agreement for so little,\u201d one EU negotiating source said. Greece is still holding out on limiting defence spending cuts, while privatisation arrangements for regional airports have yet to be agreed, but sources say differences are minimal. Another eurozone source said Tsipras had to get the deal through the Greek parliament on Sunday to secure the five-month extension before Tuesday, the day Greece must repay \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF and when its bailout programme expires. Without a bailout programme in place, the ECB is expected to pull its support for the Greek banking system, which would probably trigger capital controls in Athens. If the deal is agreed, it will have to be approved by the Greek parliament and the German bundestag. The \u20ac15.5bn offer consists of \u20ac8.7bn from the eurozone bailout fund, \u20ac3.5bn from IMF and \u20ac3.3bn from ECB bond profits due to Greece. Eurozone finance ministers will hold a last-ditch meeting on Saturday in a bid to get a deal, following four failed attempts over eight days. Days of back-to-back meetings involving Europe\u2019s most powerful leaders and finance ministers have failed to break the deadlock, leaving Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone hanging by the finest of threads. But Merkel has made it clear she wants a deal before Monday when the financial markets and the banks reopen after the weekend. The pressure on Greece is immense as the ECB has pressed pause on emergency funding for Greek banks. The Greek financial system has received about \u20ac89bn of emergency liquidity funds from the ECB, but the tap has been turned off in recent days. The ECB did not increase emergency funds on Thursday or Friday, having increased it on five previous consecutive days. Although Greek banks are running out of cash, it is far from clear whether Tsipras can carry the rest of the ruling hard-left Syriza coalition with him on the bailout deal. One Syriza MP, Costas Lapavitsas, said leaving the eurozone could offer fresh hope and was preferable to \u201cblackmail\u201d by Greece\u2019s creditors. Writing in the Guardian, he said Greece had come face to face with the \u201cruthless reality\u201d of the eurozone. \u201cThe \u2018institutions\u2019 are once again attempting to impose the policies that have failed abysmally since 2010, causing huge contraction of GDP, vast unemployment and mass impoverishment. [Accepting the proposal from the institutions] would be a national disaster accompanied by the complete humiliation of the Syriza government.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An Oxfordshire-based cyber security company has been valued at just over \u00a31bn in the first of what is expected to be a series of tech flotations on the London Stock Exchange this year. Sophos shares were priced at 225p when it started trading on Friday, which will raise $125m (\u00a380m). The flotation - the third time Sophos has attempted an IPO - puts Sophos alongside large-scaled listed UK tech businesses including ARM Holdings and Sage, the Newcastle-based software firm. The company makes security software and hardware products. It was founded in 1985 by Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer, who stepped down as joint chief executives in 2005. The company is now majority owned by the private equity group Apax Partners, which bought a stake in 2010. The value of the company reflects the necessity for cyber safety at a time when attacks on personal computer security are hitting the headlines, said analysts. \u201cThere is certainly a premium to be placed on security companies at the moment so it is not surprising to me. Security is very trendy, it is in demand, it is increasing its profile in the business community as well as technology,\u201d said Duncan Brown of market research firm IDC. \u201cThere is a big demand for security. There is a big shift in the demands of security in terms of the threat - both the type of threat and the numbers of threats increasing dramatically over the last two/three years.\u201d Sophos is offering just under 35% of its shares. The proceeds will be used to reduce debts and invest in growth. Chief executive Kris Hagerman described the move as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d for the company. Sophos planned an IPO in 2007 but abandoned a listing due to weak investor interest. Another float was considered in 2009 but the founders instead opted to sell a majority stake to Apax. Technology research company Megabuyte said the company may need to \u201caccelerate its top line growth\u201d to maintain the high valuation. \u201cIf investors want to play the undoubted attractions of the cyber security market without betting on one of the very high risk smaller players, Sophos is really the only game in town,\u201d said a note from research firm Megabuyte. The firm added that the Sophos float would help offset the loss of \u00a35bn worth of telecoms and technology equity from the stock market in recent months due to merger and acquisition activity. \u201cOn a broader point, the significance of this IPO for the London market should not be underestimated, especially given that over \u00a35bn of equity value has been, or in the process of being taken off the market in recent months. It is the largest software IPO in London for many, many years (in fact we can\u2019t remember the last time there was a \u00a31bn software IPO in London) and is particularly significant as Sophos could easily have chosen to list in the US.\u201d Ian Spence, Megabuyte\u2019s main analyst, said he expects two other tech companies to float by the end of the year.

    "webTitle": "The Eurogroup meeting - the key weekend for Greece", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What is Saturday\u2019s meeting? Eurozone finance ministers, known as the Eurogroup, are holding an emergency meeting in the hope of breaking the deadlock over Greece\u2019s debt crisis. For the last five months, the anti-austerity government of Alexis Tsipras has been at odds with Greece\u2019s international creditors, who say they will only disburse the last chunk of held-up rescue funds to Greece in return for Athens committing to further cuts. Why is the meeting important? Greece faces a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday and its bailout programme expires the same day. German chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that the Eurogroup meeting \u201cwill be decisive because time is of the essence\u201d. Saturday is realistically the last chance for Tsipras to strike an agreement because the country\u2019s lenders are demanding that the parliament in Athens ratifies any deal before markets open on Monday. Without a deal, Greece will not get the last \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds \u2013 money it needs to repay that \u20ac1.6bn. What will it take to achieve a deal? Key sticking points concern pensions, VAT rates and taxation. On pensions, differences centre on how quickly to raise the retirement age, on a top-up scheme for poorer pensioners, and on early retirement. On VAT, the creditors want Greece to raise more than it is proposing from a sales tax. On other taxes, Greece and its creditors differ over the corporate rate and Tsipras\u2019s proposal to impose a one-off tax on all corporate profits over \u20ac500,000. What happens if there is a deal? If agreement is struck on Saturday, the terms would need to be rushed through the Greek parliament on Sunday, then through the Bundestag in Berlin on Monday, in order to ensure that the bailout programme, which expires on Tuesday, is extended. What happens if there isn\u2019t? Greece will not get its bailout money and will miss its payment to the IMF. The bailout will expire the same day and without the shelter of a rescue deal, the European Central Bank is expected to cut off emergency support to Greek banks, who are relying on the central bank to cover deposit withdrawals that reached more than \u20ac4bn last week. Will Greece need to leave the euro? Without the ECB lifeline, Tsipras could be forced to impose capital controls, limiting the money savers can withdraw from banks, or closing the banks entirely to stop money flooding out of accounts. Without enough euros in the economy, Greece will have to consider launching a parallel currency to pay public sector wages and pensions. Economists are talking about Greece \u201cdrachmatising\u201d. What will it mean for Greeks? On the ground, a Greek exit from the euro, or Grexit, could leave people struggling to get basic items. Greece would need to pay for its imports with a devalued currency, so the cost of energy would rise and shortages of food and medicine are not unthinkable. Inflation would probably be rampant. What if I have booked a holiday to Greece? Holidaymakers heading to Greece are being advised to take plenty of cash with them amid fears the country\u2019s cash machines could be shut down. For those visiting other parts of the eurozone, they will find their spending money goes further as the euro continues to weaken against the pound. What would Grexit mean for the global economy? Grexit would be felt throughout financial markets and in the real economy it would rattle consumer and business confidence. The charge towards safe-haven assets such as German government bonds would continue while investors would dump bonds from other countries shaken by the eurozone crisis, such as Spain and Italy. Stocks in financial companies would come under pressure and the euro would probably weaken against other big currencies. However, analysts hope the effects would be short-lived thanks to the ECB stepping in with more quantitive easing. In the UK, the government has been stepping up contingency planning for the \u201cserious economic risks\u201d posed by a Greek default and a possible Grexit. Meanwhile, manufacturers have warned about the damage to their exports from a strong pound against the euro, which makes UK goods more expensive in their biggest market, the eurozone.",

      "body": "<h2>What is Saturday\u2019s meeting?</h2> <p>Eurozone finance ministers, known as the Eurogroup, are holding an emergency meeting in the hope of breaking the deadlock over Greece\u2019s debt crisis. For the last five months, the anti-austerity government of Alexis Tsipras has been at odds with Greece\u2019s international creditors, who say they will only disburse the last chunk of held-up rescue funds to Greece in return for Athens committing to further cuts.</p> <h2>Why is the meeting important?<br></h2> <p>Greece faces a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday and its bailout programme expires the same day. German chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that the Eurogroup meeting \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/26/greece-crisis-merkel-eurogroup-saturday-talks-decisive-deadline\">will be decisive because time is of the essence</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2015/jun/26/greece-crisis-markets-to-open-lower-ahead-of-weekend-talks-live\">Greece crisis: Hopes for deal as differences narrow \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saturday is realistically the last chance for Tsipras to strike an agreement because the country\u2019s lenders are demanding that the parliament in Athens ratifies any deal before markets open on Monday. Without a deal, Greece will not get the last \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds \u2013 money it needs to repay that \u20ac1.6bn.</p> <h2>What will it take to achieve a deal?</h2> <p>Key sticking points concern <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/jun/24/greek-debt-crisis-negotiations-interactive\">pensions, VAT rates and taxation</a>. </p> <p>On pensions, differences centre on how quickly to raise the retirement age, on a top-up scheme for poorer pensioners, and on early retirement.</p> <p>On VAT, the creditors want Greece to raise more than it is proposing from a sales tax.</p> <p>On other taxes, Greece and its creditors differ over the corporate rate and Tsipras\u2019s proposal to impose a one-off tax on all corporate profits over \u20ac500,000. </p> <h2>What happens if there is a deal?</h2> <p>If agreement is struck on Saturday, the terms would need to be rushed through the Greek parliament on Sunday, then through the Bundestag in Berlin on Monday, in order to ensure that the bailout programme, which expires on Tuesday, is extended.</p> <h2>What happens if there isn\u2019t?</h2> <p>Greece will not get its bailout money and will miss its payment to the IMF. The bailout will expire the same day and without the shelter of a rescue deal, the European Central Bank is expected to cut off emergency support to Greek banks, who are relying on the central bank to cover deposit withdrawals that reached more than \u20ac4bn last week.</p> <h2>Will Greece need to leave the euro?</h2> <p>Without the ECB lifeline, Tsipras could be forced to impose capital controls, limiting the money savers can withdraw from banks, or closing the banks entirely to stop money flooding out of accounts. Without enough euros in the economy, Greece will have to consider launching a parallel currency to pay public sector wages and pensions. Economists are talking about Greece \u201cdrachmatising\u201d.</p> <h2>What will it mean for Greeks?</h2> <p>On the ground, a Greek exit from the euro, or Grexit, could leave people struggling to get basic items.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco faced a backlash from shareholders over rewards for top executives and low pay for staff at its annual shareholder meeting on Friday, despite reporting better than expected trading. More than 18% of shareholders failed to back Tesco\u2019s remuneration report, which details the \u00a34.13m paid to new chief executive Dave Lewis for just six months\u2019 work at Tesco last year, and a \u00a31.2m payout to his predecessor, Phil Clarke, who oversaw diving sales and profits. The company is also facing an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into an accounting scandal that developed on Clarke\u2019s watch. The vote against was nearly 11%, with abstentions bringing the total protest to more than 18%. One independent investor told the packed shareholder meeting that the supermarket should adopt a new slogan: \u201cWe do not pay the living wage but we do make our executives millionaires for failure.\u201d A group of more than 30 campaigners stood to show their support as one shareholder called on Tesco to pay the living wage to its staff. Chairman John Allan promised to meet low-pay campaigners within six months. He said Tesco was \u201calive to this issue\u201d but could not make \u201can open-ended commitment to pay the living wage until a way can be found that doesn\u2019t competitively disadvantage Tesco.\u201d He said the government, campaigners and employers needed to work together to find a \u201cfair and even-handed\u201d solution. Despite the concerns raised at the meeting, Tesco\u2019s share price rose nearly 3.5% to 225.3p as it outperformed City expectations with a 1.3% fall in underlying UK sales in the three months to the end of May. Analysts had predicted a fall of up to 2.5% at Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain. It was also an improvement from the previous quarter when underlying sales fell 1.7% in the UK. Lewis said: \u201cWe are managing the business in the right way and, at a fundamental level, the business is stepping in the right direction.\u201d He said Tesco was getting back to \u201cbeing on the side of customers\u201d. Sales of fresh produce, such as soft fruit, saw a big turnaround, rising 3% faster than at its rivals. Lewis said shoppers were returning after the chain cut prices and reduced ranges to focus on stocking more customer favourites. Tesco has trimmed 20% of its product range in 15 areas, including takeaway sandwiches, soft fruit and bakery. Lewis said there would be more \u201cfundamental\u201d edits to come. Performance improved in all of Tesco\u2019s international divisions \u2013 Ireland, Asia and central Europe and Turkey \u2013 once the impact of the currency exchange rate had been excluded. He said: \u201cWe are fixing the fundamentals of shopping to win back customers and relying less on short-term couponing.\u201d The volume of goods sold in the UK rose 1.4%, while the number of customers increased by 180,000 over the period. Tesco cut prices by an average 1-1.5% while food deflation is running at 2%. Lewis said shoppers had responded to improvements such as better service and an increase in the availability of products. \u201cThe market is still challenging. We expect to see deflation for the foreseeable future and a certain amount of volatility with us for the next year. We are not expecting a straight line, but Q1 is another step in the right direction,\u201d Lewis said. He refused to call the sales figures a definitive turn in Tesco\u2019s fortunes or claim he had seen off the challenge from discounters, such as Lidl and Aldi, but he said: \u201cWe are gaining shoppers across the board. What we try to do is improve the offer and let customers decide where they want to shop. We haven\u2019t seen a fundamental shift but we have seen our gains more positive than before.\u201d Analysts said performance had clearly improved at Tesco. Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research said: \u201cThis puts Tesco at the top of the big four for UK like-for-likes\u201d and that the figures showed \u201cclear evidence of material progress\u201d on all Tesco\u2019s main strategic goals. Some analysts worried, however, that Tesco\u2019s improved trading was at the expense of profit margins. There were also fears that a lack of progress on disposals to help shore up Tesco\u2019s balance sheet would mean higher interest charges on its debts. \u201cWe believe Tesco and Mr Lewis is doing its best to recover the business, but this is at the cost of margin and Tesco will need to show it can make its sales performance profitable while dealing with a junk-rated company,\u201d said Rickin Thakrar at BESI. Reeling from the worst year in its history, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer is struggling to return to growth under Lewis. The company reported a \u00a36.4bn annual loss in April after slashing the value of its property portfolio. Tesco\u2019s profits remain under pressure as it pours money into cutting prices and improving products, customer service and stores. The group is raising money through disposals. Dunnhumby, the business behind Tesco\u2019s Clubcard, is up for auction and HSBC is reported to have been hired to explore a sale of the South Korean unit Homeplus, Tesco\u2019s biggest operation outside Britain. Lewis told shareholders that there had been no firm decision on disposing of any Tesco division. \u201cAny reshaping of the portfolio will only be done at full-value basis,\u201d he said. New-look statistics Tesco has changed the way it reports like-for-like sales \u2013 a measure of performance in established stores. The retailer has fallen in line with its rivals, and international accounting standards, by reporting sales performance excluding VAT and fuel. The change revealed the improvement in performance to a 1.3% fall in sales in the three months to 30 May against a 1.7% drop in the previous quarter. Under the measure that Tesco previously used, which includes VAT, sales fell by 1% in both quarters. James Anstead, an analyst at Barclays, said the change made comparing Tesco\u2019s performance with consensus tricky. But he said: \u201cWe can say that we were forecasting -2.8% on this basis.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has shelved promised and vital upgrades to major rail lines in the Midlands and the north of England, just weeks after the election in which the Conservatives campaigned on rebalancing the country and creating a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d. Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, said the government had \u201cpaused\u201d electrification of the Midland mainline from London to Sheffield, and the TransPennine route between Manchester and Leeds that connects major cities across the north, after Network Rail\u2019s costs spiralled and it missed targets. McLoughlin conceded that investment, vaunted as the biggest in the railways since Victorian times, was not after all going to deliver the projects promised in its \u00a338.5bn five-year plan because of what he called Network Rail\u2019s unacceptable performance. Its chairman Richard Parry-Jones, the only senior executive remaining from when the original plan was costed and agreed, is to step down and will be replaced by London\u2019s transport commissioner, Sir Peter Hendy. Hendy will lead a review over the summer to decide which elements of the five-year plan can still be delivered. The Midland electrification had been described as \u201ccritical to maintaining a reliable railway\u201d, and the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto said the work would \u201cput the Midlands at the centre of a modern, inter-connected transport network for the UK.\u201d Last October, the chancellor, George Osborne, said he was pushing forward plans for a so-called HS3 \u2013 faster trains linking Manchester and Leeds. Instead, the north\u2019s progress is likely to be hampered by the postponement of the TransPennine electrification. Northern leaders said the news came out of the blue, but questions will be asked about the manifesto commitments after Network Rail admitted knowing \u201cvery early on last year\u201d that the five-year plan would be \u201cincredibly difficult to deliver\u201d. McLoughlin said the electrification of the Great Western line from London to Wales and south-west England remained a top priority. He also said there would be a full review of Network Rail\u2019s processes in estimating costs after missed targets and overspending on electrification works. \u201cElectrification is difficult. The supply chains for complex work needs to be stronger. That is no excuse. All of these problems could and should have been foreseen,\u201d he said. McLoughlin said no Network Rail directors would receive a bonus for the past year. He said he was changing the company\u2019s structure, abolishing the oversight by a board of public members and appointing a special director to report directly to him. Richard Brown, a former Eurostar chairman, came to McLoughlin\u2019s aid during the 2012-13 rail franchise crisis in the Department for Transport. Mark Carne, Network Rail\u2019s chief executive, said he was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d that projects had to be delayed, but that it was \u201ctime to be really straight and level with people\u201d. He conceded that the five-year plan would have to be torn up, and that the rail operator had been overly optimistic about the work that could be carried out. Carne told the Guardian: \u201cWe knew, already, very early on last year that certain aspects of the plan were going to be incredibly difficult to deliver.\u201d He said other major rail projects could also be axed or \u201cre-phased\u201d after the summer review and that some were \u201cclearly\u201d under threat, but he declined to pre-empt the review by naming them. He also implied that the government and regulator should bear some responsibility for the failure to deliver the pledged upgrades. \u201cIf you had a fully specified design and the builder gave you a quote, and came back and said you couldn\u2019t do it for that, you\u2019d be annoyed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you went to a builder and said I\u2019d like an extension, and that\u2019s the degree to which you\u2019ve specified it, you\u2019d have less cause for complaint. \u201cPeople knew perfectly well there were high levels of uncertainty about this, it was widely flagged at the time, and it would be not fair for people to forget that today.\u201d Michael Dugher, the shadow transport secretary, accused the government of presiding over a \u201ccatalogue of failure\u201d and said it was \u201ctrying to shift the blame to Network Rail, but this happened on the government\u2019s watch\u201d. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, said: \u201cIt is disappointing, but perhaps not surprising, that plans announced by the Tories before the general election have been scrapped so soon after.\u201d McLoughlin said the pause meant the government could be \u201cmuch more ambitious for that route, building a powerhouse for the north\u201d, but those words cut little ice in the region. Keith Wakefield, a former leader of Leeds city council and now a board member of Transport for the North, said: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely disappointing and a big blow to the ambitions of building a northern powerhouse. Everyone agrees that what we need in the north is better connectivity across the Pennines. \u201cYou can\u2019t hope to rebalance the economy without the north getting the investment it needs. Feasibility studies have shown that electrifying that one route would create 7,000 new jobs. \u201cJust yesterday we had a meeting of Transport for the North when we were discussing these very projects \u2026 To suddenly stop the electrification exposes the whole northern powerhouse as empty rhetoric.\u201d The director of IPPR North, Ed Cox said: \u201cTransport connections and infrastructure must be the foundation on which a prosperous northern economy is built. The north already loses out substantially \u2026 Now it will see projects already too far back in the queue fall further behind.\u201d The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision is bad for regional growth and jobs. How can the government expect to build a northern powerhouse if it is unwilling stump up funds for vital transport links and infrastructure?\u201d Network Rail was reclassified last September as a public body, bringing greater oversight from the government and raising concerns about its ballooning debt, which rose another \u00a35bn last year to \u00a337.8bn. Previously, Network Rail had been able to borrow freely to meet escalating costs, but it has to \u201clive within its means\u201d since, Carne said. Last month, a damning report from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, found that Network Rail had missed more than a third of its targets in the first year of its control period, or five-year plan for 2014 to 2019, raising \u201cserious questions about its ability to deliver future projects\u201d. Shortages in the supply chain and pressure to conduct engineering works with minimal track closures have contributed to escalating costs at a time when the government is trying to clamp down on spending. Train operators on long-haul routes have grown impatient with delays caused by faults with the track. The problems at Network Rail have contributed to increasing discontent among passengers. A national survey by Transport Focus showed customer satisfaction levels fell to 80% in 2015, meaning one in five journeys was deemed unsatisfactory.",
