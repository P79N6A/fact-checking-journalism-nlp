      "bodyText": "Campaigners against low pay are claiming a breakthrough victory as Oliver Bonas, the fashion and gift retailer, has become the first high street chain in Britain to promise its staff an independently calculated living wage. Employees aged 18 and over will from Tuesday receive at least \u00a37.85 an hour, or \u00a39.15 in London \u2013 figures calculated based on the cost of living. This compares with the national minimum wage of \u00a36.50 an hour for over-21s and \u00a35.30 for workers between 18 and 21. Oliver Bonas employs 500 people across its 43 shops and its warehouse in Chessington, Surrey, rising to 650 over the Christmas period. Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said the move was a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d that would help \u201cend the low wage culture of the British high street\u201d. Jobs on the high street, and in customer service, are some of the lowest paid in Britain, according to official figures. \u201cMajor players in the retail sector have for a long time claimed that the living wage is too expensive to implement on the high street,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThis move demonstrates that while it\u2019s not always an easy choice, it is the right choice.\u201d Many large employers have softened their resistance to calls for pay rises in the light of government plans to impose steady increases in the statutory minimum wage over the next five years. Last month Ikea pledged to meet campaigners\u2019 calls to pay the living wage, becoming the first large, out-of-town retailer to do so. The Living Wage Foundation has accredited more than 1,700 companies, including about a quarter of the FTSE 100 and other big businesses such as Nestl\u00e9 and Nationwide. Until recently, however, the retail industry has been unmoved by campaigners\u2019 arguments. Oliver Tress, founder and managing director of Oliver Bonas, said: \u201cWe are thrilled that we are now able to pay the living wage to all members of our team. We want to do everything we can to pay \u2026 a wage that reflects hard work, loyalty and the real cost of living.\u201d In his summer budget, George Osborne surprised many by announcing that the minimum amount employers must pay staff aged over 25 was to rise to \u00a37.20 an hour from April next year. The figure would then climb to \u00a39 by 2020, he said. The chancellor argued the measure was part of a strategy to boost productivity, remodelling Britain as a \u201chigher wage, lower tax and lower welfare\u201d country. But not all business leaders have welcomed Osborne\u2019s intervention. On Saturday former Sainsbury\u2019s boss Justin King, a longstanding critic of the living wage campaign, told the BBC the plan for accelerated rises in the minimum wage for many workers was \u201cnot economically justified\u201d. He said: \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about productivity without recognising that one of the consequences of productivity is less people producing the same output. Companies will invest more in productivity and as a consequence there will be less jobs.\u201d King\u2019s own pay has featured in debates about spiralling boardroom rewards for those at the top of large corporations. He left Sainsbury\u2019s last summer but received \u00a38.5m in cash and shares during his last two years at the retailer, though most of that sum related to the release of long-term share bonuses, some granted as far back as 2008. King\u2019s successor, Mike Coupe, announced a 4% pay increase last week, taking the supermarket\u2019s standard rate of pay to \u00a37.36 an hour, its highest increase in more than a decade. Elsewhere over the weekend it emerged that bondholders at Four Seasons Health Care, the debt-laden care home operator, were concerned about the group\u2019s ability to absorb higher wage bills. \u201cThe scary part is the living wage could have a \u00a340m effect on profits over the next five years,\u201d one bondholder told the Sunday Times. \u201cIt is untenable.\u201d Four Seasons, which is owned by private equity group Terra Firma, has announced a review of its finances after second-quarter losses rose to \u00a326m. Oliver Bonas, which sells jewellery and homeware as well as fashion and gifts, reported a 9% rise in like-for-like sales for the year to 30 November 2014. Turnover grew from \u00a323.3m to \u00a330.3m.",

      "bodyText": "For startups, it\u2019s a tough road to success: about 50% of small businesses fail in the first five years, and tech startups fail at a rate that\u2019s estimated to be as high as 90%. But, for hopeful entrepreneurs trying to get their companies off the ground, there\u2019s a bright side: a growing number of inexpensive, innovative apps are available to fight those figures. From handling transactions and scheduling meetings to creating brand awareness and keeping track of receipts, there\u2019s an almost unlimited array of online tools emerging every day to ease the path to business success. To cut through the noise, we asked entrepreneurs for some of their favorites and put together a list of the essentials. Here are 12 tools you should download before you open your doors for business. Squarespace (Free) Sarah Kim, founder and editor of By Way of Brooklyn, a magazine that highlights female entrepreneurs, says that website building platform Squarespace has had a huge impact on her business. In addition to helping her develop an online presence, the Squarespace app, released as part of the company\u2019s 2014 redesign, enables Kim to easily upload up-to-the-minute content. \u201cWe\u2019re always on the move, and when we can\u2019t get back to a computer to update our site, we use the Squarespace app \u2013 we can blog and post on the spot,\u201d she says. Available for iPad, iPhone and Android Product Hunt (Free) With the ever expanding array of startups, apps and other tech tools available to businesses, it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a way to organize it all. Product Hunt, a Reddit-style website where users can submit and vote on the latest technology, fills the bill. A must-use resource for anyone looking to stay ahead of the tech game. Available for iPad, iPhone, Android VSCO Cam (Free) When it comes to creating a professional public image, Kim recommends VSCO Cam, a photo-filtering app that works across multiple platforms. Many of her magazine\u2019s photographers use it for filtering the photos that appear in the magazine, and the app enables her staff to quickly create Instagram and Twitter photos that match the look and design of the magazine. Available for iPad, iPhone and Android Periscope (Free) Some of the most useful business apps were originally intended for other purposes. Periscope, for example, offers users the option to \u201cexplore the world through someone else\u2019s eyes\u201d. For business users, that world can include meetings being held halfway across the world. And, with the ability to transform a smartphone into a body cam, it\u2019s easy to take part in an important conference, even when you\u2019re in a different time zone. Available for iPad, iPhone and Android Sunrise Calendar (Free) For scheduling, Carl Waldekranz, cofounder and CEO of Sweden-based online retail platform Tictail, uses Sunrise Calendar to keep his schedule straight. \u201cI am able to look at my entire day in a super concise and organized way,\u201d he says. \u201cNot to mention the push notification alerts I receive to remind me when an appointment is close.\u201d Its newly released keyboard feature allows users to quickly view their calendar to schedule appointments. Available for iPad, iPhone and Android Mint, Zoho (Free) It goes without saying that tracking finances is vital for startups, particularly for owners who are funding their companies out of pocket. One of most popular is Mint, a free app that made its name with a personal finance platform that seamlessly integrates multiple accounts. For those willing to pay for something more explicitly business-oriented, Zoho offers time-tracking, invoicing and expense management options, all with an easy-to-use interface designed for ordinary (read: non-accounting professional) business owners. Both Mint and Zoho are available for iPhone, iPad and Android. Square Register (Free, $10 for the hardware) An older app that\u2019s come of age, the Square Register app makes iPad-processed credit card purchases almost seamless. Dennis Lee, cofounder of New York-based Astoria Coffee, relies on it to process transactions, but has also found that it gives him insight into his business. \u201cIt has a really useful backend feature that allows us to track sales and organize data,\u201d he says. Square also provides a suite of other business apps, from payment and payroll processing to, most recently, an appointment manager. Available for iPad, iPhone, Android When I Work Employee Scheduling (Free) Scheduling can be an especially difficult part of running a small business, particularly as the number of remote employees increases. When I Work makes it possible to easily view a company\u2019s schedule, the availability of each worker and the overall labor budget. When scheduling conflicts arise or a worker has to cancel at the last minute, it\u2019s easy to quickly and seamlessly contact potential replacements. Available for iPad, iPhone. Android Asana (Free) Jason Ballard, founder and CEO of sustainable home improvement retailer TreeHouse, finds that navigating between multiple work-related concerns can get confusing. \u201cRather than clogging my email inbox with messages about all the things I\u2019m working on, we use Asana,\u201d, he says. Asana is a project management tool. \u201cIt lets me manage my fundraising, store openings, hiring, my \u2018product radar\u2019, and all my other projects into easily-organized buckets.\u201d Available for iPad, iPhone, Android Shoeboxed (Free) One of the most important \u2013 and least discussed \u2013 aspects of small business ownership is paper management. Regardless of your business, chances are that you\u2019re going to find yourself picking through piles of receipts and business cards, trying to remember the name of this supplier or figure out whether that meal was deductible. Shoeboxed makes it possible to digitize and store receipts and business cards in an easily searchable archive. As a bonus, the app also features a GPS-based mileage tracker, which can help simplify accounting and tax preparation. Available for iPad, iPhone, Android Tiny Scanner (Free) Speaking of paper management, Tiny Scanner makes it possible for your phone to easily convert documents to PDFs. So, rather than trying to find places to file all the tax documents, supplier letters and other pieces of information that flow across your desk, you can automatically convert them to electronic documents and organize them on your computer. Available for iPad, iPhone, Android Slack (Free) Getting employees on the same page can be extremely difficult, especially when team members are in different countries. Tictail\u2019s Waldekranz gets around some of those difficulties with Slack, an app that offers chat rooms, private group spaces and direct messaging. Some refer to it as \u201cGchat on steroids\u201d. All exchanges become searchable, which increases its business effectiveness. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Slack,\u201d he says. \u201cWherever I am it feels like I\u2019m close to the team.\u201d Available for iPad, iPhone, Android",

The falls came as investors reacted to similar dips in Asia and comments from the Federal Reserve vice-chairman, Stanley Fischer, over the weekend that suggested a rate increase could come sooner than some expected. In China, where a journalist from one of China\u2019s leading financial magazines \u201cconfessed\u201d on state television that his articles triggered the recent stock market chaos, the Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.8% lower on Monday. It has fallen 12.5% this month, the third straight month of declines. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index fell 1.3% on Monday to finish its worst monthly performance since January 2014. European markets too appeared to be heading for another down day. Markets in Germany and France were down. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 was closed for a public holiday. It was a lacklustre start to a critical week as the Fed considers its first interest rate rise since the recession. On Friday the Labor Department will release July\u2019s non-farm payroll jobs report. Economists are forecasting that the economy added about 200,000 new jobs over the month.

The stock market gyrations of the past few weeks had led some to speculate that the Fed may delay raising rates this year.

In a note to investors on Monday, Barclays strategist Krishna Goradia said the comments had \u201clikely led to markets pricing a higher probability (now 32%) of a Fed move next month\u201d.

    "webTitle": "Tesco rescue: has Dave Lewis's first year been a success?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On Dave Lewis\u2019s first day in charge at Tesco he sent an email to the retailer\u2019s 500,000 staff warning it had \u201curgent issues\u201d to deal with. However, the supermarket boss could never have imagined the scale of the problems he would face at Britain\u2019s biggest retailer. The discovery of a \u00a3326m black hole in its accounts and a continuing downturn in sales and profits transformed his task from a turnaround job to a rescue mission. On the first anniversary of Lewis becoming chief executive, we examine how he has performed against five key criteria identified when he was appointed boss and after the accounting scandal at the company was revealed. Brand Lewis was the first outsider to run Tesco since Sir Jack Cohen founded the company as a market stall in east London in 1919. With a background in marketing similar to former boss Sir Terry Leahy, Lewis\u2019s prime task was to breath new life into the increasingly stale 96-year-old brand. Lewis had been the brains behind the \u201clove your body\u201d advertising campaign for Unilever\u2019s Dove soap brand and ran other successful marketing programmes for the household goods group around the world \u2014 including one that forced rival Proctor &amp; Gamble to pull Ariel out of parts of South America because the name became synonymous with lavatory seats. Tesco was lost in the middle market when Lewis took over, with Aldi and Lidl grabbing market share from one side and Waitrose, Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks &amp; Spencer the other. The company had become renowned as \u201cTescopoly\u201d, a dominant force that acted in its own interests rather those of local communities and customers. So far, Lewis has sought to repair the brand by fixing the company itself, particularly its customer service. Extra staff have been added to the shop floor and prices have been cut. Lewis has pledged Tesco will only spend money on what customers can \u201cfeel\u201d and claimed there was an \u201copportunity to go back to what made this brand great and a champion for the consumer\u201d. A new marketing campaign and branding scheduled for this autumn should promote these changes. Lewis has hired a new advertising agency in BBH, the agency behind the long-running \u201cLynx effect\u201d advertising campaign. However, Lewis\u2019s efforts to rebuild the brand have been hampered by the accounting scandal. Cutting prices and raising sales With Aldi, Lidl and the likes of Poundland setting a new low bar in customers\u2019 expectations on price, Tesco needed to strike back under Lewis in order to regain credibility. For too long, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket had let prices drift upwards as it tried to protect profits. Lewis began his campaign last Christmas, slashing the price of the \u201cfestive five\u201d \u2013 bags of vegetables including carrots, potatoes, Brussels sprouts and parsnips \u2013 to 49p. The promotion was simple, widely advertised and made Tesco 65% cheaper than 2013 for those items \u2013 and at least 20% cheaper than rivals. The move helped Tesco enjoy a relatively strong Christmas. Since then he has cut 25% off key branded items including Hovis, Coca-Cola, Marmite and Tetley. Overall, Tesco has invested more than \u00a3200m into cutting prices and improving service. All of that action helped Tesco improve its performance, which came in ahead of City expectations in its last trading statement in June. Where it had cut prices, goods were flying off the shelves. However, the overall value of sales continue to fall \u2013 down 1.3% in the three months to the end of May. In a highly competitive market, turning things around wwill not be easy. Tesco may not be the worst performer in the market \u2013 that is Asda \u2013 but it continues to lose market share according to the latest figures from analysts at Kantar Worldpanel. Big stores Tesco\u2019s famed land bank, built up in the days of Leahy, was once seen as one of its prime assets, striking fear into smaller competitors. Now that shopping habits have changed with the arrival of online grocers and the popularity of buying little and often from small local shops, Tesco\u2019s collection of large stores seems more like an albatross around its neck. But this is one area where \u201cDrastic Dave\u201d \u2013 a nickname from his Unilever days \u2013 has certainly lived up to his name. Tesco has already closed 43 stores, although about half of them were little shops, and cancelled plans for another 49 in the UK. Lewis has not hung around in sorting out the unwanted porfolio. Sites in Scotland have been sold and millions of pounds handed to local councils in order to reach settlement on local developments now abandoned. The Tesco boss has continued where his predecessor started in downsizing stores by leasing out unwanted areas to other businesses such as gyms or retailers. However, Lewis has clearly recognised that such ideas can only take him so far and he still needs to convince shoppers of the attractions of his retail behemoths. Asset sales A year ago, Tesco shareholders wanted Lewis to consider selling off peripheral assets such as streaming service Blinkbox, coffee chain Harris + Hoole and Giraffe, the restaurant business. However, the sale of larger businesses has moved to the top of the agenda. Tesco needs to raise billions to offset a collapse in profits and win back its credit rating after it was downgraded to junk by rating agencies. Lewis announced that Dunnhumby, the data business behind Clubcard, was up for sale in January, yet it is still to be sold. Talks about Tesco\u2019s South Korean business have also lasted all summer. Although loss-making Blinkbox has gone, the slow progress on sell-offs will be a disappointment for Lewis and finance director Alan Stewart. The protracted negotiations mean Tesco is expected to fail to reach the hoped-for figure of \u00a35bn from selling Dunnhumby and Homeplus, its business in South Korea. This will frustrate the shareholders and analysts who claimed that, instead of selling assets, Tesco should have turned to investors for cash and launched a multibillion pound rights issue when its share price recovered earlier in 2015. However, Lewis has been more decisive in cutting costs. As well as closing stores and scrapping new developments, he has shut the company\u2019s headquarters in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, closed the defined benefit pension scheme and axed dividend payments. Managing expectations Lewis is now running a company with different ambitions to the one he took over last year. He joined Tesco from Unilever a month earlier than initially planned after Sir Richard Broadbent, the chairman at the time, issued another profit warning and asked Lewis to take office immediately. When Lewis arrived, Tesco was forecast to deliver annual trading profits of between \u00a32.4bn and \u00a32.5bn. However, it eventually reported a record pre-tax loss of \u00a36.4bn due to writedowns on the value of its stores and from the accounting scandal. Shares in Tesco surged after Lewis unveiled a radical turnaround plan in January, which included the store closures, but in recent weeks the gains made early in 2015 have been lost. Tesco\u2019s share price is now 17% lower than when Lewis took charge \u2013 but higher than the lows it hit last December as the repercussions of the accounting scandal were felt. Senior Tesco insiders are insisting it is a five-year job to get the company back on track and the City now appears to have bought into this outlook. However, Lewis must gradually show more evidence to shareholders and Tesco staff that the pain of the last year was worth it and that one of Britain\u2019s leading companies is slowly getting back on its feet.",

Overall, Tesco has invested more than \u00a3200m into cutting prices and improving service.</p> <p>All of that action helped Tesco improve its performance, which came in <a href=\"http://(http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/26/tesco-sales-drop-13-but-outperform-market-expectations).\">ahead of City expectations in its last trading statement in June</a>.

In a highly competitive market, turning things around wwill not be easy. Tesco may not be the worst performer in the market \u2013 that is Asda \u2013 but it continues to lose market share according to the latest figures from analysts at Kantar Worldpanel.</p> <p><strong>Big stores</strong><br></p> <p>Tesco\u2019s famed land bank, built up in the days of Leahy, was once seen as one of its prime assets, striking fear into smaller competitors.</p> <p>Now that shopping habits have changed with the arrival of online grocers and the popularity of buying little and often from small local shops, Tesco\u2019s collection of large stores seems more like an albatross around its neck.</p> <p>But this is one area where \u201cDrastic Dave\u201d \u2013 a nickname from his Unilever days \u2013 has certainly lived up to his name. </p> <p>Tesco has already closed 43 stores, although about half of them were little shops, and cancelled plans for another 49 in the UK. Lewis has not hung around in sorting out the unwanted porfolio. Sites in Scotland have been sold and millions of pounds handed to local councils in order to reach settlement on local developments now abandoned.</p> <p>The Tesco boss has continued where his predecessor started in downsizing stores by leasing out unwanted areas to other businesses such as gyms or retailers.</p> <p>However, Lewis has clearly recognised that such ideas can only take him so far and he still needs to convince shoppers of the attractions of his retail behemoths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"418b76d963dc4931c4d341bc0d77eb51dc3b7664\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/418b76d963dc4931c4d341bc0d77eb51dc3b7664/204_35_3296_1978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Home plus store in Seoul, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Home plus store in Seoul, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Asset sales</strong></p> <p>A year ago, Tesco shareholders wanted Lewis to consider selling off peripheral assets such as streaming service Blinkbox, coffee chain<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/21/harris-hoole-founders-tolleys-quit-tesco-backed-coffee-chain\"> Harris + Hoole</a> and Giraffe, the restaurant business.</p> <p>However, the sale of larger businesses has moved to the top of the agenda. Tesco needs to raise billions to offset a collapse in profits and win back its credit rating after it was downgraded to junk by rating agencies.</p> <p>Lewis announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/10/tesco-sell-financial-footing-blinkbox-dobbies-dunnhumby\">Dunnhumby,</a> the data business behind Clubcard, was up for sale in January, yet it is still to be sold.

The protracted negotiations mean Tesco is expected to fail to reach the hoped-for figure of \u00a35bn from selling Dunnhumby and Homeplus, its business in South Korea. This will frustrate the shareholders and analysts who claimed that, instead of selling assets, Tesco should have turned to investors for cash and launched a multibillion pound rights issue when its share price recovered earlier in 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/10/tesco-staff-promised-turnaround-bonus-sales-profits-dave-lewis\">Tesco staff promised turnaround bonus if sales and profits rise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Lewis has been more decisive in cutting costs. As well as closing stores and scrapping new developments, he has shut the company\u2019s headquarters in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, closed the defined benefit pension scheme and axed dividend payments.</p> <p><strong>Managing expectations</strong><br></p> <p>Lewis is now running a company with different ambitions to the one he took over last year. He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/29/tesco-profit-warning-dividend-slashed-75-per-cent\">joined Tesco from Unilever a month earlier than initially planned</a> after Sir Richard Broadbent, the chairman at the time, issued another profit warning and asked Lewis to take office immediately. </p> <p>When Lewis arrived, Tesco was forecast to deliver annual trading profits of between \u00a32.4bn and \u00a32.5bn. However, it eventually reported a record pre-tax loss of \u00a36.4bn due to writedowns on the value of its stores and from the accounting scandal.</p> <p>Shares in Tesco surged after Lewis unveiled a radical turnaround plan in January, which included the store closures, but in recent weeks the gains made early in 2015 have been lost. Tesco\u2019s share price is now 17% lower than when Lewis took charge \u2013 but higher than the lows it hit last December as the repercussions of the accounting scandal were felt.</p> <p>Senior Tesco insiders are insisting it is a five-year job to get the company back on track and the City now appears to have bought into this outlook.</p> <p>However, Lewis must gradually show more evidence to shareholders and Tesco staff that the pain of the last year was worth it and that one of Britain\u2019s leading companies is slowly getting back on its feet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pfizer, one of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical groups, has said it will resist demands from investors and transparency campaigners that it disclose results from all historical drug trials. A powerful group of 85 investors, representing more than \u00a32.5tn of assets, recently joined forces with medical research campaigners to press for greater transparency from the 25 largest pharmaceuticals groups in the world. The campaign group, AllTrials, which is collaborating with the investor initiative, will shortly publish rankings of the 50 largest pharmaceutical groups based on scores for each firm\u2019s disclosure policies. The rankings are expected to be used by investors to further push for transparency on drug trials, possibly by tabling activist resolutions at annual shareholder meetings. The eagerly awaited table was scheduled to be published this month but has been delayed. Pfizer is not expected to score as poorly as some of its competitors, but its resistance to campaigners\u2019 demands will disappoint those who had hoped the world\u2019s third-largest drugs firm \u2013 with a market value of more than $200bn \u2013 was among the most likely to be won over. Pfizer said it had a \u201clongstanding commitment to clinical trial transparency\u201d and it already published data for trials from 2007. Requests for earlier data are considered on an individual basis. But it added: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that further investment beyond this would offer value to patients, health services or to our shareholders.\u201d Other pharmaceutical groups are known to take an even tougher stance against trial transparency. Fellow US firm AbbVie, for example, took legal action against the European Medicines Agency two years ago to block the regulator from publishing trial data relating to its best-selling Humira rheumatoid arthritis treatment. AbbVie argued the information was \u201cconfidential and commercially sensitive\u201d. The case was settled out of court, resulting in partially redacted information being released. Responding to the latest remarks from Pfizer, Sile Lane, co-founder of AllTrials, said: \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t the last word from Pfizer. I hope they will continue the conversation about making information from trials on the medicines we use today available. Pfizer\u2019s investors are telling them they expect them to do it.\u201d Transparency advocates point to studies estimating about half of drug trials have not been published. Studies also suggest trials with negative results are twice as likely to remain unreported as those with positive results. As a consequence, doctors and patients are left with incomplete information and a distorted picture of the safety and efficacy of many drugs and medical devices currently in use, campaigners say. A string of data manipulation scandals have further tarnished the pharmaceutical industry in recent years, adding to concerns about what lies in unpublished information. Six weeks ago, the newly formed \u00a32.5tn investor group \u2013 including Aviva Investors, Boston Common, the Wellcome Trust, and 65 local authority pension funds in the UK \u2013 wrote to the world\u2019s 25 largest drug firms, calling on them to open their results archives. Investors are adopting demands set out by AllTrials, a campaign group supported by groups including the British Heart Foundation, Royal College of Surgeons and the Medical Research Council. In July, the Financial Times gave its support to the investor campaign. Ben Goldacre, a doctor, writer and co-founder of the AllTrials campaign group, said the initiative sent \u201ca clear message to the chief executives, boards and other shareholders that they need to recognise that medicine and society have changed. Companies cannot expect any longer to routinely withhold the results of clinical trails on treatments taken by millions of people around the world.\u201d The disclosure criteria set out by AllTrials have been adopted by British group GlaxoSmithKline, while US competitors Bristol-Myers Squib and Johnson and Johnson last year set up similar data-sharing programmes. In each case requests for access are dealt with independently of the drugs companies. Political reaction to the reluctance of drug companies to disclose clinical trial data has led to moves to compel businesses to register future trials, and disclose results, in the US and Europe. Campaigners remain concerned, however, about firms electing to carry out future trials in other jurisdictions, and about drugs groups continuing to sit on unpublished results from previous trials.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The biggest North Sea gasfield discovered in the past decade is to be developed, after energy authorities gave approval for a \u00a33bn investment that could produce enough gas to meet 5% of the UK\u2019s needs. The Danish energy company Maersk will develop the Culzean field that it discovered in 2008, after the UK Oil and Gas Authority granted approval on Monday. The field has gas resources that are the equivalent of 250-300m barrels of oil, and the plan to develop it is expected to create more than 400 jobs and support an estimated 6,000 more in the UK. The announcement comes amid a wider decline in the viability of North Sea production - and fears of British job losses - and takes advantage of tax breaks announced in the budget this year. The chancellor, George Osborne, welcomed it as \u201ca clear signal that the North Sea is open for business\u201d. The UK has committed to increased gas-fired electricity generation, and the Maersk-operated \u201chigh pressure, high temperature\u201d (HPHT) Culzean development should start producing gas in 2019 for at least 13 years, peaking at the equivalent of 60,000-90,000 barrels of oil a day. Maersk Oil, along with its partners JX Nippon and BP (Britoil), will be investing about \u00a33bn in developing Culzean, with at least half of that committed to investment in the UK. The project has been made more attractive to the investors by new tax allowances to offset the higher capital costs for this type of energy extraction, and to encourage further exploration nearby. The chancellor warned that such support would not have been made available to the industry by an independent Scotland, which could not have afforded to offer tax breaks. Speaking in Aberdeen, Osborne said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement sends a clear signal that the North Sea is open for business. Already the UK\u2019s oil and gas industry supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country and this \u00a33bn investment comes on the back of massive government support for the sector. \u201cDespite challenging times, this government has backed the oil and gas industry at every turn, introducing a vital package of support to help it to protect and create jobs. Despite its claims, the Scottish government would have struggled to deliver such support alone \u2013 its own numbers showed that due to the current oil price an independent Scotland would have faced a \u00a320bn black hole in its public finances over the first three years.\u201d Osborne\u2019s upbeat message came as others in the industry warned thousands of British jobs could be at risk after local contractors lost out on bids to build offshore platforms in the North Sea. The Tyneside-based OGN was excluded from the shortlist to help develop an oilfield licensed to US firm Chevron, GN, and criticised policies that saw foreign firms win UK tax breaks without having to use local suppliers. The Oil and Gas Authority has said its role is to get \u201cbest value\u201d for the licences. Andy Samuel, the authority\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cMaersk Oil and partners\u2019 \u00a33bn investment to develop the Culzean discovery is excellent news for the UK during a period when the decline in global oil prices has created difficult operating conditions for this critical sector of our economy. The Oil and Gas Authority has worked closely with Maersk Oil and HM Treasury on the development plans for the Culzean field, which will support many new contracts in the oil and gas supply chain across the UK.\u201d Maersk Oil\u2019s chief executive, Jakob Thomasen, said Culzean was an important development for the UK and for the company, and reflected its commitment to the future of North Sea production. He said: \u201cWe are pleased the field will support UK economic growth as well as extend understanding of HPHT development. Culzean is the latest in a series of large investments by Maersk Oil in the North Sea.\u201d However, Maersk said last week it would be seeking regulatory permission to close its Janice oil rig in the North Sea, as it struggled to cope with the impact of plunging oil prices that have rendered much of the region\u2019s high-cost production unprofitable.",

Speaking in Aberdeen, Osborne said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement sends a clear signal that the North Sea is open for business. Already the UK\u2019s oil and gas industry supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country and this \u00a33bn investment comes on the back of massive government support for the sector.</p> <p>\u201cDespite challenging times, this government has backed the oil and gas industry at every turn, introducing a vital package of support to help it to protect and create jobs. Despite its claims, the Scottish government would have struggled to deliver such support alone \u2013 its own numbers showed that due to the current oil price an independent Scotland would have faced a \u00a320bn black hole in its public finances over the first three years.\u201d</p> <p>Osborne\u2019s upbeat message came as others in the industry warned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/30/north-sea-oil-jobs-at-risk-platform-builder-ogn-misses-out-on-contract\">thousands of British jobs could be at risk after local contractors lost out on bids to build offshore platforms in the North Sea</a>. The Tyneside-based OGN was excluded from the shortlist to help develop an oilfield licensed to US firm Chevron, GN, and criticised policies that saw foreign firms win UK tax breaks without having to use local suppliers. The Oil and Gas Authority has said its role is to get \u201cbest value\u201d for the licences.</p> <p>Andy Samuel, the authority\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cMaersk Oil and partners\u2019 \u00a33bn investment to develop the Culzean discovery is excellent news for the UK during a period when the decline in global oil prices has created difficult operating conditions for this critical sector of our economy. The Oil and Gas Authority has worked closely with Maersk Oil and HM Treasury on the development plans for the Culzean field, which will support many new contracts in the oil and gas supply chain across the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Maersk Oil\u2019s chief executive, Jakob Thomasen, said Culzean was an important development for the UK and for the company, and reflected its commitment to the future of North Sea production. He said: \u201cWe are pleased the field will support UK economic growth as well as extend understanding of HPHT development. Culzean is the latest in a series of large investments by Maersk Oil in the North Sea.\u201d</p> <p>However, Maersk said last week it would be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/26/petrol-marked-down-and-200-north-sea-jobs-on-line-amid-oil-price-drop\">seeking regulatory permission to close its Janice oil rig</a> in the North Sea, as it struggled to cope with the impact of plunging oil prices that have rendered much of the region\u2019s high-cost production unprofitable.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The new capital expenditure figures released last week continue to reinforce that the mining boom is done and dusted, and that the transition from the boom continues at a slow pace. The budget measures designed to spur investment by small business as yet don\u2019t appear to have had much impact, but there are some small signs of improvement. Capital expenditure is essentially spending done by the private sector on infrastructure, buildings and machinery and equipment. So when companies are increasing their investment in such things, the signs are generally good. Not only will companies need to employ someone to construct the buildings and structures, they will also need people to use the machinery and equipment. So it is not great to hear that in the June quarter, total private new capital expenditure fell in trend terms by 3.9%, and was down 10% on where it was a year ago: The quarterly and annual falls were both the worst since the depths of the 1990-91 recession. The trend figure has now fallen for 12 consecutive quarters, breaking the record for the longest such streak also set during the early 1990s recession. Clearly it\u2019s not a good thing when you keep comparing things to the deepest recession in the past 70 years. But the reasons for the collapse are not due to Australia being in a recession; it is purely due to the end of the mining boom. And regardless of what you might hear about Australia\u2019s competitiveness, high labour costs, or sovereign risk, the reason is the collapse of the iron ore price: The fall from about US$135 a tonne in 2013 to now hovering between US$50 and US$55 a tonne has been reflected in the fall in investment in the mining sector. Earlier this month, mining investment consultants Behre Dolbear listed Australia as the second best place in the world for mining companies to invest. This was the same place as we were listed in 2014, but oddly one place lower than we were in 2013 when we had both a carbon price and a mining tax. The mining investment boom was all about buildings and structures \u2013 essentially building mines and railways and ports. While certainly the industry invests in equipment, the big money is in construction. And this is reflected in the figures as well which show the investment in building and structures down 5.3% in the quarter, and machinery and equipment down 0.8%: What this has meant is that overall investment in the non-mining sector is now larger than in the mining sector: That is not to say the mining sector is now unimportant. Investment in the mining sector is only less than the non-mining sector because that sector includes \u201cnon-mining\u201d industry. When you break the spending down in to individual industries, in the past year the mining industry had six times as much investment as occurred in the second highest industry of transport, postal and warehousing: But given there is little we can do about the iron ore price, the real focus is on the non-mining sector. And certainly that was the focus in the budget of the $20,000 instant asset write off. This was aimed squarely at encouraging small businesses in the non-mining sector to buy machinery and equipment. The immediate signs are, not surprisingly, weak. The June quarter would have only included about six weeks for any businesses to take advantage of the tax changes and thus it\u2019s no shock, nor sign of failure, that spending on machinery and equipment was down 0.8% in the June quarter. The important aspect for judging the performance of this policy is the estimates for investment for the 2015-16 year. The ABS gathers six estimates of investment spending for each financial year. The first estimate is made in January and February (ie in January 2015 an estimate is made for spending in 2015-16), the third occurs in July-August and is the latest one we have available. As a general rule the third estimate is greater than the second (unless something unexpectedly bad occurs), and certainly in the non-mining sectors the third estimate for money spent on machinery and equipment has always been greater than the second such estimate: Last Thursday the treasurer, Joe Hockey, focused on these estimates when he tweeted: \u201cToday\u2019s Capex figs show $4.5b improvement in expected investment in non-mining sector this financial year. Budget measures having +ve impact.\u201d He is right that there was a $4.5bn increase in expected investment in estimate three compared with estimate two. But he does fail to mention that the expected investment is still 5.1% below the same estimate made this time last year. But partly that is because 2014-15 was an OK year for the non-mining sector investment wise. After a flat 2012 and 2013, in the middle to end of 2014 things were looking to be picking up \u2013 which is why the estimate done a year ago was actually pretty optimistic: But while non-mining investment grew in the June, September and December quarters last year, it has fallen since then. Investment in the latest quarter was 1.1% below that of December. So certainly compared with last year things are not looking good. The May budget predicted non-mining investment in 2015-16 would grow by 4%, so a 5.1% fall is not what is desired \u2013 especially given the budget also predicted mining investment would fall by 25.5% and the third estimate for mining investment is 37% below that made this time last year. But where Hockey has a point is in the improvement from the second estimate. Now yes there is usually an improvement, but the 17% jump in the estimated investment for machinery and equipment in the non-mining sector is the biggest such improvement in the past four years and the third biggest ever recorded. Thus Hockey has a fair claim to say the budget measures have had an impact on investment. The question, however, given the fall in mining investment is greater than expected, and the overall investment in the non-mining sector looks set to be much lower than last year, is whether the improvement will be enough. Hockey can claim the non-mining investment picture is a bit rosier than it was three months ago, but the more accurate way of putting it might be to say it is bad, just not as bad as we thought it would be.",

The budget measures designed to spur investment by small business as yet don\u2019t appear to have had much impact, but there are some small signs of improvement. </p> <p>Capital expenditure is essentially spending done by the private sector on infrastructure, buildings and machinery and equipment. So when companies are increasing their investment in such things, the signs are generally good. Not only will companies need to employ someone to construct the buildings and structures, they will also need people to use the machinery and equipment. </p> <p>So it is not great to hear that in the June quarter, total private new capital expenditure fell in trend terms by 3.9%, and was down 10% on where it was a year ago:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"total private new capital expenditure (trend)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2SxgE/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The quarterly and annual falls were both the worst since the depths of the 1990-91 recession. </p> <p>The trend figure has now fallen for 12 consecutive quarters, breaking the record for the longest such streak also set during the early 1990s recession.</p> <p>Clearly it\u2019s not a good thing when you keep comparing things to the deepest recession in the past 70 years. </p> <p>But the reasons for the collapse are not due to Australia being in a recession; it is purely due to the end of the mining boom. And regardless of what you might hear about Australia\u2019s competitiveness, high labour costs, or sovereign risk, the reason is the collapse of the iron ore price:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Price of iron ore\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ANFU9/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The fall from about US$135 a tonne in 2013 to now hovering between US$50 and US$55 a tonne has been reflected in the fall in investment in the mining sector. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dolbear.com/latest-happenings/2015-where-to-invest\">Earlier this month</a>, mining investment consultants Behre Dolbear listed Australia as the second best place in the world for mining companies to invest. This was the same place as we were listed in 2014, but oddly one place lower than we were in 2013 when we had both a carbon price and a mining tax.</p> <p>The mining investment boom was all about buildings and structures \u2013 essentially building mines and railways and ports. While certainly the industry invests in equipment, the big money is in construction. And this is reflected in the figures as well which show the investment in building and structures down 5.3% in the quarter, and machinery and equipment down 0.8%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Private new capital expenditure\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/roA3Y/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>What this has meant is that overall investment in the non-mining sector is now larger than in the mining sector:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Private new capital expenditure (volume)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XXiKe/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That is not to say the mining sector is now unimportant. Investment in the mining sector is only less than the non-mining sector because that sector includes \u201cnon-mining\u201d industry. </p> <p>When you break the spending down in to individual industries, in the past year the mining industry had six times as much investment as occurred in the second highest industry of transport, postal and warehousing:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Private new capital expenditure 2014-15 (current $)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7ZxpC/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But given there is little we can do about the iron ore price, the real focus is on the non-mining sector. And certainly that was the focus in the budget of the $20,000 instant asset write off. This was aimed squarely at encouraging small businesses in the non-mining sector to buy machinery and equipment.</p> <p>The immediate signs are, not surprisingly, weak. The June quarter would have only included about six weeks for any businesses to take advantage of the tax changes and thus it\u2019s no shock, nor sign of failure, that spending on machinery and equipment was down 0.8% in the June quarter. </p> <p>The important aspect for judging the performance of this policy is the estimates for investment for the 2015-16 year. </p> <p>The ABS gathers six estimates of investment spending for each financial year.
