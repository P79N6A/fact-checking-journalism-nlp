      "bodyText": "BP\u2019s application to drill for oil deep in the pristine Great Australian Bight has been rejected for a second time by the offshore oil and gas regulator, Nopsema. The regulator said on its website on Monday evening the company would be given an opportunity to revise its plans and resubmit. The decision implies the regulator found BP\u2019s plans did not meet its regulatory requirements, although the reasons were kept secret. The company has already been given another chance to revise its plans and resubmit when Nopsema came to the same decision in November 2015. \u201cNopsema will typically provide two opportunities to modify and resubmit, but is not restricted to providing only two opportunities,\u201d the regulator said in its announcement. The application process has been criticised in a recent Senate inquiry as secretive and weak, since most of the process is not made public, where it could be scrutinised. The bight, off Australia\u2019s southern coastline, is a haven for whales, sea lions and other marine life. It supports a large fishing industry and much of it is covered by nature reserves. It is unclear what sort of modelling BP has conducted of an oil leak in the bight, which is a major concern to conservationists since BP was responsible for the world\u2019s biggest oil leak \u2013 the Deepwater Horizon spill of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 which occurred in calmer and more shallow waters than those in the bight. Just last week, Shell caused a large leak in the same waters. But modelling of a leak commissioned by the Wilderness Society suggested it would affect most of the southern coast of Australia, with the worst-affected areas depending on the season. \u201cBP should just give up and ditch its plans for the bight before it wastes any more of its shareholders\u2019 money on an investment that the world can\u2019t use and will become a stranded asset,\u201d said the Wilderness Society national director, Lyndon Schneiders. The director of Wilderness Society South Australia, Peter Owen, said: \u201cOne would expect BP to go to great lengths to show the regulator it had learned from the Gulf of Mexico disaster and submit an application that would far exceed the required standards. Instead it again submitted a substandard application in the hope it will be approved.\u201d The Greens senator for South Australia, Robert Simms, who established a senate inquiry into BP\u2019s plans with independent Senator Nick Xenophon, also called on BP to give up on its plans. \u201cIt\u2019s clear BP aren\u2019t respecting the precious Great Australian Bight environment as once again Nopsema determine that BP\u2019s shoddy environmental plan requires modifications,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot risk a catastrophic oil spill in the Bight, a pristine environment which is home to endangered and threatened species like the southern wright whale and Australian sea lion. Any major spill would also decimate our coastal tourism and fishing industries which contribute 9,000 sustainable jobs and almost $1.5bn to the South Australian economy,\u201d Simms said. Sea Shepherd Australia\u2019s managing director, Jeff Hansen, said in a statement: \u201cThe whales of the Great Australian Bight can breathe a slight sigh of relief today. \u201cSix years on, BP has still not cleaned up its catastrophic spill in the Gulf of Mexico, with mothers still giving birth to stillborn dolphin calves,\u201d he said. \u201cIf BP is allowed to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight, it\u2019s not a question of if there will be an oil spill but when, and the Great Australian Bight is not worth the risk.\u201d A spokeswoman for BP said although the decision meant BP\u2019s application didn\u2019t meet Nopsema\u2019s regulatory requirements for approval, it wasn\u2019t a rejection. \u201cNopsema has provided BP with a further \u2018opportunity to modify and resubmit\u2019 its environment plan, which is not a rejection but another step in the normal, iterative process with this regulator,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have allowed sufficient time in our programme schedule for this regulatory process and continue to work toward commencing exploration drilling in late 2016, subject to the acceptance of our environment plan.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The global community is badly prepared for a rapid increase in climate change-related natural disasters that by 2050 will put 1.3 billion people at risk, according to the World Bank. Urging better planning of cities before it was too late, a report published on Monday from a Bank-run body that focuses on disaster mitigation, said assets worth $158tn \u2013 double the total annual output of the global economy \u2013 would be in jeopardy by 2050 without preventative action. The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery said total damages from disasters had ballooned in recent decades but warned that worse could be in store as a result of a combination of global warming, an expanding population and the vulnerability of people crammed into slums in low-lying, fast-growing cities that are already overcrowded. \u201cWith climate change and rising numbers of people in urban areas rapidly driving up future risks, there\u2019s a real danger the world is woefully unprepared for what lies ahead,\u201d said John Roome, the World Bank Group\u2019s senior director for climate change. \u201cUnless we change our approach to future planning for cities and coastal areas that takes into account potential disasters, we run the real risk of locking in decisions that will lead to drastic increases in future losses.\u201d The facility\u2019s report cited case studies showing that densely populated coastal cities are sinking at a time when sea levels are rising. It added that the annual cost of natural disasters in 136 coastal cities could increase from $6bn in 2010 to $1tn in 2070. The report said that the number of deaths and the monetary losses from natural disasters varied from year to year, but the upward trend was pronounced. Total annual damage \u2013 averaged over a 10-year period \u2013 had risen tenfold from 1976\u20131985 to 2005\u20132014, from $14bn to more than $140bn. The average number of people affected each year had risen over the same period from around 60 million people to more than 170 million. Although developed countries have been responsible for the bulk of historic global emissions, poorer countries are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change and they demanded financial help from the west as part of last December\u2019s breakthrough global deal to reduce emissions. Oxfam this week called on rich countries to make good on the pledges made at the Paris conference to provide the funding to help developing countries adapt to the effects of global warming. \u201cClimate change is a brutal reality confronting millions of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. Their need for financial support to adapt to climate extremes is urgent and rising,\u201d Oxfam said in its Unfinished Business report. \u201cInternational support for adaptation falls well short of what is needed. Latest estimates indicate that only 16% of international climate finance is currently dedicated to adaptation \u2013 a mere $4bn\u2013$6bn per year of which is public finance.\u201d According to the the facility, disaster risk is affected by three factors. It said these were: hazard \u2013 the frequency of potentially dangerous naturally occurring events, such as earthquakes or tropical cyclones; exposure \u2013 the size of the population and the economic assets located in hazard-prone areas; and vulnerability \u2013 the susceptibility of the exposed elements to the natural hazard. It added that hazard was increasing due to climate change; exposure was going up because more people were living in hazardous areas and that vulnerability was on the rise because of badly designed and poorly planned housing. The World Bank-run body said the population was expected to rise by at least 40% in 14 of the 20 most populated cities in the world between 2015 and 2030, with some cities growing by 10 million people in that period. \u201cMany of the largest cities are located in deltas and are highly prone to floods and other hazards, and as these cities grow, an ever greater number of people and more assets are at risk of disaster.\u201d Francis Ghesquiere, head of the secretariat at the The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, said: \u201cBy promoting policies that reduce risk and avoiding actions to drive up risk, we can positively influence the risk environment of the future. The drivers of future risk are within the control of decision makers today. They must seize the moment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Heathrow airport\u2019s campaign for a third runway comes covered in a Union flag. It is conveyed by the logo \u2013 a stylised flag with arrows pointing in all directions \u2013 and rests on the patriotic argument that expansion would bring economic benefits. But, until now, Heathrow hasn\u2019t told us about a different form of benefit that has nothing to do with the claimed national interest: its chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, and boardroom colleagues could pick up bonuses of unspecified size if the government gives a thumbs-up to a third runway. Some will regard this news as wholly unremarkable. Isn\u2019t expanding Heathrow part of the stated corporate ambition? Don\u2019t companies dish out bonuses all the time on slighter pretexts? Isn\u2019t this exactly how you would expect Heathrow\u2019s owner \u2013 a consortium led by Spanish group Ferrovial plus Qatari and Chinese funds \u2013 to motivate its top executives in London? Possibly. But Heathrow has been oddly shy about confirming the existence of the bonus scheme until it had to be disclosed in the annual report. Holland-Kaye himself dodged the question when interviewed by this newspaper in January, even though the accounts say the incentive scheme was established last year. It rather looks as if Heathrow was happy for bosses at Gatwick, who get a financial kicker if their airport is sold, to catch some flak while staying silent on their own potential gains until the final hour. Even now, though, the disclosure is minimal. The accounts don\u2019t reveal how much Holland-Kaye and colleagues could receive if a third runway is approved. This is a poor show. Bonuses for building a new runway on time and on budget would be easy to understand.

Boris, don\u2019t blame bonuses on the EU Boris Johnson, arch opponent of Heathrow expansion, would be better advised to bang the above drum than attempt the heroic non-sequitur that FTSE 100 chief executives are paid so much because the UK is a member of the European Union. It is completely true, of course, that Footsie bosses\u2019 pay, expressed as a multiple of average earnings at the same companies, has taken off at \u201can extraordinary, inexplicable and frankly nostril-wrinkling rate\u201d. And, yes, it\u2019s factually correct that the club of big-company chief executives is overwhelmingly in favour of the UK staying in the EU. But asserting a causal link between boardroom excess and EU membership is ridiculous. Most of the factors driving inflation in boardroom pay aren\u2019t hard to identity: old-fashioned greed, pusillanimous fund managers, mutual back-scratching among directors who sit on each others\u2019 boards, consultants peddling complex incentive schemes, the cult of the superstar chief executive, and so on. None of those influences would evaporate if the UK left the EU. Johnson\u2019s idea seems to be that EU system of regulation is so opaque that the executive class can exploit it to exclude competition and thus boost their pay packets. This reveals a surprising na\u00efvety on the part of the former mayor of London. Even if Brussels ran on 100% transparency, the pay spiral would not be broken; and, anyway, remuneration committees tend to find a way around most obstacles. The unpredictable bounce of oil It\u2019s not one of Goldman Sachs\u2019 more eye-catching oil forecasts, like last September\u2019s warning that prices could shortly fall to $20 a barrel, or the famous prediction from 2008 that $200 could be on the way. Instead, the US investment bank expects that a product that currently fetches $47-a-barrel will average $45 in the current quarter and then $51 in the last three months of this year. In the punditry stakes, that does not qualify as sticking your neck out. There\u2019s no disgrace in that, of course, especially since Goldman\u2019s wilder imaginings never came to pass. Back in 2008, the peak was $147 a barrel; this time the bottom was seen at $26.

Note the qualification, however: surpluses will return early next year, when Goldman is expecting oil to slip back to $45 a barrel. It is noteworthy that an extremely bearish and well-followed forecaster of the oil price is now slightly less bearish. But the wider picture seems as obscure as ever: oil has bounced off its lows but nobody is truly confident about what happens next.",

    "webTitle": "A third of people in the UK have experienced poverty in recent years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One in three people have experienced poverty in recent years, according to figures that underline the precarious nature of work in Britain. Anti-poverty campaigners welcomed news that the proportion of people experiencing long-term, or persistent, poverty had declined to one of the lowest rates in the EU. But they highlighted Britons\u2019 relatively high chances of falling into poverty as the latest evidence that a preponderance of low-paying and low-skilled jobs left many families at risk of hardship. The Office for National Statistics said in 2014 6.5% of the UK population was in persistent poverty, amounting to approximately 3.9 million people. That was the lowest rate since comparable records began in 2008. The UK has the third lowest rate in the EU for persistent poverty, defined as experiencing relative low income \u2013 less than 60% of median household income \u2013 in the current year, as well as at least two of the three preceding years. But the ONS figures also showed a relatively high turnover of people in and out of poverty compared with other EU countries. As a result, a high proportion of people had suffered hardship for at least a short period. Between 2011 and 2014, 32.5% of the UK population experienced relative income poverty at least once. David Cameron said \u201can all-out assault on poverty\u201d would be at the centre of his second term as prime minister. But he has been criticised for changes to benefits that risk increasing working poverty. Julia Unwin, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the figures showed the government must do more to increase social mobility and job security. \u201cThe ONS figures lay bare the true scale of the challenge if an \u2018all-out assault on poverty\u2019 is to be successful,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government has been taking steps to secure a more prosperous society with lower levels of poverty. But these alone are not enough to provide a route out of hardship and fulfil David Cameron\u2019s pledge to truly transform the life chances of the country\u2019s worst off people and places.\u201d The figures on relatively low persistent poverty were seized on by the government as evidence its efforts were paying off. \u201cThe government is determined to tackle poverty and its causes, particularly through work. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve introduced reforms such as the new \u201cnational living wage\u201d, the extension of free childcare to 30 hours and increases to the personal allowance,\u201d said a spokesman. Figures on overall poverty were less flattering for the UK. The ONS noted previously released figures showing that the UK\u2019s overall poverty rate \u2013 the proportion of the population at risk of poverty in the current year \u2013 was 16.8% in 2014, the 12th highest in the EU. The figures on the risk of people falling into poverty and the chances of them escaping it chimed with other evidence of low job security in the UK. Between 2010 and 2013, 7.8% of the UK population entered poverty for the first time. Only Ireland and Greece in the EU had higher entry rates. The UK\u2019s exit rate from poverty was 48.6%, second only to Denmark in the EU. The ONS said: \u201cThis means that, in the UK, the chances of getting into poverty are relatively high, but the chances of getting out of poverty are also high.\u201d That pattern will intensify scrutiny of what lies beneath the UK\u2019s relatively strong recovery in employment in recent years. Labour market experts emphasise that record high employment has failed to usher in a corresponding recovery in wage growth. Some of that is explained by the fact many of the jobs being created are in low-paying, low-skilled work where there is little prospect of promotion. Conor D\u2019Arcy, a policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the figures in part reflected the fact job tenure was relatively short in the UK. The figures also echoed the thinktank\u2019s findings that people in the UK struggle to escape low pay. A Resolution Foundation investigation last year found that over a 10-year period, just one in four low-paid workers managed to move on to consistently higher wages. \u201cThere\u2019s a real need for employers to help their staff progress,\u201d said D\u2019Arcy. The Trades Union Congress said the relatively high chance of falling into poverty in the UK was a longstanding trend. \u201cWe have a long history of what is called \u2018rubber band\u2019 or recurrent poverty \u2013 lots of people who bounce between being and not quite being poor,\u201d said Richard Exell, the TUC\u2019s senior labour market analyst. \u201cThere are long-term institutional factors including weak trade unions, low collective bargaining coverage, an economy that has large numbers of people at the bottom end of the skills range and a lack of vocational training.\u201d The ONS also noted that some people were significantly more at risk of enduring poverty than others. The persistent poverty rate was higher for women than for men and it was higher for single-person households than those with two adults. Education also played a role, and two in five people who left school without any formal qualifications experienced poverty at least once between 2011 and 2014, the ONS said. That compared with one in five of those with a degree or higher.",

Brent crude continues to hover close to the $50 a barrel market, currently up 2.55% at $49.05 having earlier climbed as high as $49.47. It is at its highest levels for around six months. More on the Greek vote this weekend, courtesy Reuters: Greece\u2019s parliament will vote on a new package of tax hikes and reforms demanded by its international lenders on Sunday, two days before euro zone finance ministers assess whether Athens qualifies for much-needed bailout loans. The bill would increase value added tax by 1 percentage point to 24 percent, raise tax on fuel, tobacco and alcohol, liberalise the sale of banks\u2019 non-performing loans and detail the set-up a new privatisation fund, government officials said. It will also include details on a contingency mechanism to impose tighter austerity measures, which will be activated only if Greece misses its fiscal targets, the officials said on Monday. The vote is expected to test Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 left-led government, which has a thin majority of 153 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament. Athens says that if activated, the contingency measures will not hurt the poor. Passing the reforms before the Eurogroup meeting on May 24, is a demand of international lenders to wrap up the review which will unlock the next tranche of funds that Athens will use to pay IMF loans, state arrears and ECB bonds maturing in July. Wall Street is moving higher, helped by the Apple news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently 101 points or 0.58% higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was one very clear source of growth for the Dow Jones this afternoon, and it wasn\u2019t the latest US economic data. The Empire State manufacturing index, the only notable number on the day\u2019s agenda, vastly underperformed expectations, plunging from a 14 month high of 9.6 to a 3 month nadir of -9.0. Yet news that Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway took a $1 billion stake in Apple during its (miserable) first quarter helped lift the tech company by over 2.5%. As is the weight of Apple this upwards shift more than compensated for the weak manufacturing figure and, alongside the oil-inspired gains for the likes of ExxonMobil and Chevron, ensured the Dow opened nearly 90 points higher after the bell. The FTSE couldn\u2019t get anywhere near that level of growth as the day went on. Yet with Brent Crude crossing $49 per barrel for the first time since in 6 months, and its miners led on a merry-romp by the jubilant Lonmin, the FTSE finally managed to eke out a 5 point rise as the afternoon wore on. Over in Greece, reports of new votes in parliament ahead of the next Eurogroup meeting: Warren Buffett is not the only one keen on Apple. A number of fund managers have been making positive noises on the iPhone maker: Thomas Fitzgerald at EdenTree Investment Management said: Apple\u2019s share price has fallen about 28% from 2015\u2019s February peak on uncertainty over the future growth of iPhones, which accounts for 66% of sales. Beyond these near-term concerns, the anticipated launch of iPhone 7 will create fresh opportunity to take further market share. There is also still a large upgrade opportunity within its existing installed base \u2013 with only 40% of iPhone users upgraded to the new generation 6 or 6S models. Continued strong cash generation and its balance sheet fortress will continue to support the Apple\u2019s design and development over the long term. As a result, we believe shares are attractively valued at current levels. The company is also making significant progress towards a higher recurring, subscription-led revenue model through the launch of Internet and entertainment services, such as cloud storage, Apple Music and Apple TV. This could drive greater earnings visibility and potentially stronger profitability in future years. And here\u2019s Geir Lode, Head of Hermes Global Equities and manager of the Hermes Global Equity Fund: The Apple share price has been undergoing some recent volatility, but we remain supporters of the stock. People tend to get hung up on things like new products and how many it is selling, and when it will disclose numbers, but we think you need to take a broader, longer-term view. There is work to be done in product transitioning in the US and Europe, but if you look at the quality of its product lines versus the competition and the company\u2019s enormous cash pile, we believe Apple remains in a very strong market position. But Josh Spencer, manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Equity Fund, is less convinced about the company\u2019s growth prospects: We own a very small position in Apple, as like many others, we find the company and its products appealing. However, we are seeing signs the smartphone industry is starting to mature and Apple is trying to reinvent itself and come up with other ideas to generate revenue. Its recent share price fall has certainly made Apple appear more attractive, but also important to keep in mind the size of the company. At a market cap of more than $500bn, it is quite difficult to continue to compound from here. We are currently seeing more compelling opportunities to generate returns in the tech sector in areas such as cloud computing. Apple has now reclaimed the title of \u2018world\u2019s most valuable company\u2019 from Alphabet, Reuters says. Ding ding.... Wall Street is open. Apple has jumped to the top of the Dow Jones risers, following the news that Berkshire Hathaway has taken a $1bn stake. Another day, another warning against Brexit from the Bank of England. Today\u2019s message comes from deputy governor Andrew Bailey, who has told City executives that Britain could lose its status as an international financial sector if the UK leaves the EU. That\u2019s because banks from outside Europe can currently base themselves in the capital, and then offer financial services more easily across the bloc. He was speaking at a Financial Regulation Summit organised by Reuters, so over to them for the details: \u201cWe need a banking system to support the domestic economy but I am afraid we don\u2019t have a God-given right to have anything in terms of international. That decision will be taken by many actors over time,\u201d Bailey said. The EU provides rules for banks, insurers and asset managers that provide a \u201cpassport\u201d for them to operate freely across the bloc\u2019s single market. This includes banks from outside Europe,such as the United States and Asia. \u201cWhat matters to them a lot is having the passport. If you are a non-EU firm operating in London, then having the passport is important,\u201d Bailey said. New economic data out of America has reinforced concerns that economic growth is stumbling. The Empire State manufacturing index, which tracks factory output in the New York region, has lurched to -9.02 this month. Many firms reported a drop in new orders, pulling the index down. Economists expected a reading of +6.5%. Warren Buffett is probably nursing a chunky loss on the Apple shares, given he bought them between 1 January and 31 March. The FT points out: Shares in the technology giant have fallen by more than 19 per cent since mid-April after it disclosed its first quarterly revenue fall in 13 years and its first decline in iPhone sales. Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, predicts that the oil price will be quite subdued over the next year. Up they go.... Billionaire investor Warren Buffett hasn\u2019t lost faith in Apple, despite the recent drop in its share price. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway group has just revealed it took a new stake in the tech firm in the first quarter of 2016, worth around $1bn. That\u2019s a welcome boost to Apple CEO Tim Cook, after his company lost its title of the world\u2019s most valuable company to Alphabet (parent company of Google) last week. One for technical chartists in the audience: (basically, the oil price has surged to a point where you\u2019d expect it to fall back. But if it doesn\u2019t, then it might \u2018break out\u2019 and continue to rise #chartism ) Here\u2019s more detail from the Goldman Sach\u2019s oil report that has sent crude prices soaring to a six-month high today. This chart suggests that the oil market has dramatically rebalanced in recent weeks, due to declining production and a surge in demand: Goldman reckons that demand has picked up in Asia: Stronger vehicle sales, activity and a bigger harvest are leading us to raise our Indian and Russia demand forecasts for the year. And while we are reducing our US and EU forecasts on the combination of weaker activity and higher prices than previously assumed, we are raising our China demand forecasts to reflect the expected support from the recent transient stimulus. The headline news is that Goldman now believes the oil market has lurched back into deficit this quarter, earlier than expected. However, the firm also believes we\u2019ll be facing a surplus again in 2017: And that\u2019s because oil nations will probably keep boosting production: Goldman says: Low-cost producers will continue to drive production growth in the New Oil Order \u2013 with growth driven by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, the UAE and Russia. Second, non-OPEC producers had mostly budgeted such price levels and there remains a pipeline of already sanctioned non-OPEC projects. In fact, we see risks to our production forecasts as skewed to the upside as we remain conservative on Saudi\u2019s ineluctable ramp up and Iran\u2019s recovery. Brexit could also send UK house prices tumbling, Fitch suggests today. Bad news for home owners, but possibly a boost to younger renters \u2013 if they aren\u2019t hit by other side-effects..... Fitch has also pointed out that some British firms might benefit if the UK quits the European Union, weakening the pound. The rating agency says: For the corporate sector, the leave scenarios could have mixed effects, depending on sector. UK exporters would benefit from improved price competitiveness, due to sterling\u2019s depreciation. However... UK companies with significant foreign currency debt would face servicing issues. UK airlines could be significantly affected by sterling depreciation due to their foreign currency cost base. So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that budget airline Ryanair opposes Brexit. It just wheeled out a Boeing 737 with a Remain campaign slogan painted on the fuselage, for a press conference with chancellor George Osborne today. Rating agency Fitch has just warned that European economies could be disrupted if Britain votes to leave the EU. In a new report, Fitch warns that the populist parties across the region would get a boost if the UK public decide to quit. And that could drive up the borrowing costs of weaker members - possibly sparking a repeat of the 2012 eurozone debt crisis \u2013 if investors begin to fear that countries will quit the euro. They say: Brexit would create a precedent for countries leaving the EU. It could boost anti-EU or other populist political parties, and make EU leaders more reluctant to implement unpopular policies with long-term economic benefits. Negotiating the terms of the UK\u2019s exit could exhaust the EU\u2019s time and energy and open up new fronts of disagreement. Brexit could shift the centre of gravity of the EU, making it more dominated by the eurozone core, poorer, more protectionist and less economically liberal. If the UK were to thrive outside of the EU, it might encourage other countries to follow suit. Fitch points out that the banking sectors of Ireland, Malta, Luxembourg, Spain, France and Germany all have sizeable links to the UK. The EU could also be a poorer place without Britain: Brexit would reduce the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU budget (a net \u20ac7.1bn in 2014 after rebates), potentially to zero. This would imply that other net contributors would have to increase payments, or net recipients accept lower EU expenditure. Fitch: \u2018Brexit\u2019 Would Increase Downside Risks to EU Sovereigns Morgan Stanley agrees with Goldman Sachs: This chart explains very clearly why Goldman has reversed its position on the oil market. It shows the various incidents that have disrupted oil supply recently, and their likely impact on supply during the rest of 2016. Reuters is reporting that the Nigerian authorities have apprehended members of a group behind recent attacks on its oil pipelines: The Nigerian army has arrested several people suspected of having been involved in a recent wave of attacks on pipelines in the restive Delta region, a military source said on Monday. Nigerian newspapers reported that the army had arrested several members of a militant group called Niger Delta Avengers which has claimed a string of attacks in the southern swamps. Those attacks have knocked Nigeria\u2019s oil output down to its lowest level in decades; one reason that the oil market is now in deficit, according to Goldman. More UK business chiefs are cutting back on investment ahead of the EU referendum next month. That\u2019s according to a survey conducted by Credit Suisse that found little enthusiasm for Brexit: Although mining companies are rallying this morning, other sectors are in retreat. Big name companies like BT, Barclays, ITV and Unilever have all lost at least 1.3%. And traders are blaming persistent worries about the UK\u2019s EU referendum next month. Overnight, the CBI has cut its growth forecasts for the UK this year to 2%, down fdrom 2.3%, partly due to Brexit concerns. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn warned that: \u201cA dark cloud of uncertainty is looming over global growth, particularly around weakening emerging markets and the outcome of the EU referendum, which is chilling some firms\u2019 plans to invest.\u201d Those disappointing Chinese retail sales, industrial production and investment figures released on Saturday aren\u2019t helping the mood either. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: Losses are broad based with some mixed economic data out of China over the weekend and ongoing fears over the risk of the UK voting to leave the EU at the end of next month both weighing. Shares in BP and Royal Dutch Shell have risen by around 0.8% this morning, following the jump in the oil price. Goldman is also predicting that the oil market will remain in deficit until the end of the year. However, it would then return to oversupply in 2017: If they\u2019re right, that suggests prices may not rise too dramatically from current levels. Brent crude oil is bobbing around a six-month high, as traders digest Goldman\u2019s claim that the market is now in deficit: The oil price has jumped this morning after Goldman Sachs declared that the long run of oversupply was coming to an end. In a new report, the Wall Street firm argues that the oil market has actually flipped into deficit, due to various supply disruptions. That would end a two-year run of oversupply that pushed crude prices down to 13-year lows at the start of 2016. Goldman writes: \u201cThe oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected.... The market likely shifted into deficit in May ... driven by both sustained strong demand as well as sharply declining production.\u201d Goldman has also hikes its US crude price forecast to $50 a barrel for the second half of 2016, from a $45 estimate in March. That has send US crude jumping by 1.5% in early trading, to $46.92 per barrel. Brent crude (sourced from the North Sea) is also up 1.5% to $48.55 per barrel. The wildfires that struck Canada\u2019s Fort McMurray were the most newsworthy reason that production levels have fallen recently. Other factors include disruption in Nigeria, where pipelines have been sabotaged, and the swathe of US shale producers who have halted drilling since prices fell. Ands that means the market will stay in deficit through the second half of this year, according to Goldman anyway. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a definite Monday morning feeling in the City today. Europe\u2019s main stock markets have opened in the red, following some disappointing Chinese economic data over the weekend. China\u2019s factory output missed forecasts in April, growing by 6% versus expectations of 6.5%. Investment and retail sales also grew more slowly than expected last month, which is giving investors another reason to worry about its economy. Commerzbank economist Zhou Hao summed up the mood: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that growth engines are losing momentum, and the growth outlook has turned soft as well. It\u2019s clear the government wants to manage down or re-anchor market expectation.\u201d And that\u2019s pushed markets down in early trading: Britain\u2019s FTSE: 6108, down 29 points French CAC: 4289, down 30 points (Germany is closed for Whit Monday or Pentecost Monday). We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day. That will include any developments around Greece \u2013 with just seven days to go until finance ministers to (hopefully) conclude the Greek bailout review.",

      "bodyText": "Shell has said it has begun work to repair a fault in a flowline that has resulted in around 2,000 barrels worth of oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico. More than 88,000 gallons of oily-water mixture has been released from the Glider Field, a group of four underwater oil wells located around 97 miles south of Port Fourchon in Louisiana. The company said it suspects a line connecting these wells to a Shell platform leaked oil on Thursday, creating a 13 mile-wide slick on the surface of the water. Shell said the oil is not expected to reach the shoreline and that no fisheries have been closed. The company said vessels and aircraft have been deployed to mop up the spill. \u201cThe trajectory is in a westerly direction with no shoreline impacts anticipated at this time,\u201d Shell said in a statement. \u201cSkimming continued today using infrared technology with support from aerial resources. Joint efforts have recovered approximately 1,826 barrels, over 76,600 gallons, of oily-water mixture. On-water recovery efforts are ongoing. Shell has mobilized equipment to begin repairs.\u201d The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said it has deployed its \u201cfull investigative resources\u201d to identify the cause of the oil spill and any potential improvements needed to underwater infrastructure. Shell\u2019s platform, called Brutus, started operation in 2001. The oil giant has been given permission by the BSEE to resume its operations in the gulf. The US federal government has tightened up drilling regulations following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, which resulted in the deaths of 11 people, as well as the coating of thousands of seabirds and marine animals in oil. Last month, the Obama administration outlined further measures to help prevent \u201cblowouts\u201d that result in oil spells, as well as requirements for operators to put in place several back-ups in case something goes wrong. However, there have been criticism of government and oil industry response to the 2010 disaster. A US Chemical Safety Board report released last month found regulations nor industry practices have improved since the BP spill. \u201cThe last thing the Gulf of Mexico needs is another oil spill,\u201d said Vicky Wyatt, a Greenpeace campaigner. \u201cThe oil and gas industry\u2019s business-as-usual mentality devastates communities, the environment, and our climate. Make no mistake, the more fossil fuel infrastructure we have, the more spills and leaks we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s past time to keep it in the ground for good.\u201d",

More than 140,000 servings of strawberries and cream are expected to be sold during this year\u2019s Wimbledon fortnight \u2013 often heralded as the start of the British strawberry season \u2013 but hospitality consultants Beacon has warned that farms face a grim and financially unsustainable future after the new minimum wage was introduced in April. Beacon, which represents about 2,000 independent businesses across the hospitality, leisure and care home markets as well as suppliers \u2013 including regional fresh produce businesses \u2013 said suppliers expect the price of strawberries to rise this year due to the pressure of the national living wage on UK farmers. Some are predicting the closure of British farms as strawberries become an unprofitable operation, replaced in supermarket by cheaper imports. The warning echoes a recent National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) report which revealed that the impact of the new minimum pay threshold could cost growers 58% of their profits immediately while over the next four years it could cost fresh food businesses up to 158% of current business profit, making strawberry growing completely unprofitable for British farmers without extra government support. It was a record-breaking year in 2015 for British strawberries, with sales topping \u00a3325m, comfortably beating the record of \u00a3275m in 2014. But Paul Connelly, managing director of Beacon, said: \u201cIt seems that strawberry fields may not be forever in the British countryside. Our suppliers are warning that the landscape of soft fruit farming and fresh produce is under threat with the possibility of cheaper foreign imports replacing British produce on supermarket shelves and on restaurant menus.\u201d Connelly said the company was \u201cworking with our suppliers and customers to provide context to any price rises they might have to pass through and agree with the NFU in calling for the government, and the wider supply chain, to support our fresh produce farmers through these wage changes\u201d. The apparent crisis follows the ongoing milk price row, in which many dairy farmers were forced out of business after their margins were eroded by major retailers. Other fresh produce farmers would be affected by national living wage, Beacon said, with labour-intensive farming industries likely to suffer the most. Farmers of salad essentials including lettuce, cucumber, peppers and cherry tomatoes are particularly at risk from the new pay threshold, combined with rising production costs and aggressive supermarket price wars. The NFU is urging the government to help reduce the impact of the national living wage on British horticulture and farming businesses.",

      "bodyText": "UK supermarkets have reported soaring demand for samphire, the salty coastal sea plant also known as sea asparagus, thanks to TV cookery shows. Over the last year, sales of samphire, a healthy accompaniment to fish, have rocketed by 80% at Tesco, thanks to its popularity as an ingredient on BBC1\u2019s Saturday Kitchen and Channel 4\u2019s Sunday Brunch. The plant grows naturally near estuary waters and tidal creeks but for the second year running is being commercially harvested for the supermarket in the Vale of Evesham, Worcestershire \u2013 an area renowned for the quality of its asparagus. The grower uses glasshouses to replicate coastal temperatures and growing conditions to ensure tip-top condition and flavour. \u201cUntil about five years ago, samphire was still only really known by foodies but since being championed by chefs such as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Jamie Oliver it is becoming a mainstream delicacy,\u201d said Tesco vegetable buyer Bart Vangorp. \u201cUnless you lived near the sea it was quite hard to find, which is why we decided to stock it to make it easier for our customers to buy.\u201d The vegetable is also stocked by Waitrose \u2013 which has reported a sales uplift of 50% year on year \u2013 and Marks &amp; Spencer. Samphire (also known as glasswort) is not really a seaweed, but grows in the tidal zone on muddy, sandy flats, often around estuaries and tidal creeks. A succulent plant of the salicornia species, it resembles a miniature cactus without the spines. In season from mid-May until October, it is best prepared by either lightly steaming or saut\u00e9ing it. Young shoots can be eaten raw and enjoyed for their crunchiness. The plant, typically sold on fresh-fish counters as well as in supermarket chiller sections, has vibrant green stalks with a crisp texture and succulent tender tips. It has a distinctively salty flavour and is low in calories with virtually no fat. It is also rich in vitamins, especially vitamin C. Tesco\u2019s samphire is supplied by speciality growers Westlands \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest producer of edible sea plants. The company started growing samphire seven years ago and initially produced about two tonnes a year, but demand is now so strong that it is on track to harvest about 240 tonnes this year. Peter Taylor, general manager of Westlands, said: \u201cWhile the British season lasts from mid-May until October, estuary-grown samphire has a notoriously short window of being at its very best, which is about 2-3 weeks from late June to early July, after which it becomes too stringy. It doesn\u2019t need to grow in water \u2013 it likes to be moist. And we only use the glasshouse to enhance and lengthen the natural growing days and season.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil prices rose more than 2% to their highest since last November after the interruption to supplies from Nigeria and a forecast from Goldman Sachs that a dramatic cut in stockpiles would maintain prices at about $50 (\u00a335) for the rest of the year. Brent crude futures were up $1.23, or 2.5%, to trade at $49.05 a barrel at lunchtime in London on Monday, as investors bet that the ultra-low prices seen over the past two years were over. The closure of a processing plant in Nigeria was the latest problem to hit the global supply of oil. Last week\u2019s wildfires around the Canadian city of Fort McMurray, disrupting the region\u2019s oil sand production, has been cited as another factor bolstering prices. Shale oil firms in the US have also cut back output to counteract the low prices that have made it uneconomic to continue drilling. Last year, oil production was booming and demand remained subdued in response to the faltering global economy. The cost of Brent crude slumped to $27 a barrel in January as oil firms were forced to increase their stocks to record levels. The disruptions to supply triggered a U-turn in the outlook for the oil market from Goldman Sachs, which has previously warned of global storage hitting capacity and of another oil price crash to as low as $20 a barrel. \u201cThe oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThe market likely shifted into deficit in May ... driven by sustained strong demand and sharply declining production.\u201d However, like most oil analysts, Goldman cautioned that the market would flip back into a surplus in the first half of 2017 as the higher price of crude oil made it profitable for shale operators to restart operations. The US investment bank said prices of approximately $50 per barrel in the second half of 2016 would encourage exploration and production activity in many parts of the world to pick up again. Nigeria\u2019s oil businesses have come under attack from environmentalists concerned that exploration and drilling in the Niger delta is spoiling the countryside and poisoning animals and local communities. The latest disruption to an Exxon Mobil plant meant that Nigeria has seen three facilities that produce 700,000 barrels a day suffering supply problems, pushing its output down to a 20-year low. In the US, crude production has dropped to 8.8m barrels a day, 8.4% below its 2015 peak as the sector suffers a wave of bankruptcies. And in China, output fell 5.6% to 4m barrels a day in April from a year earlier. Several members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) have sought to counter this effect in a race for market share. Opec pumped 32.44m barrels a day in April, up 188,000 from March, the highest since at least 2008. \u201cThe inventory buffer may be preventing full price recovery and \u2026 the market is rightly nervous about the sustainability of outages,\u201d said Morgan Stanley. Barclays said: \u201cWhile the supply-side disruptions are supporting oil market balances, refinery margins are starting to weaken, especially in Asia.\u201d It said weaker demand from those refiners could produce downside risk to prices in the third quarter. In a sign the oil price rally might be losing steam, Reuters said data showed that speculators cut their holdings of Brent futures for a second week running, reducing their exposure by a total of 15% from record highs.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Co-opting a business leader that the British public loves to hate \u2013 Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary \u2013 was perhaps a risky move by the remain campaign, particularly when he appeared to have given a very contrary message a few months back. Speaking at Stansted on Monday alongside the chancellor, George Osborne, Vince Cable and Ed Balls, O\u2019Leary said air fares would increase if the UK voted to leave the EU. \u201cIf Britain leaves the single market, Britain may be forced out of the open skies regime, and air fares and the cost of holidays will rise,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not speculation, that\u2019s a certainty.\u201d On Tuesday May 24 David Cameron repeated the claim that Brexit would push up holiday prices at an event at Easyjet. Just how certain is O\u2019Leary\u2019s certainty? When announcing Ryanair\u2019s remain colours in February, O\u2019Leary was filmed saying: \u201cI don\u2019t believe air fares will rise if Britain leaves the EU.\u201d Despite his blunt quote, he spent much of that press conference outlining why, even if a vote to leave would not cause an immediate rise in fares, British travellers could pay more in future. A stuttering economy would see the government looking for extra revenue, he claimed, and airlines have long felt aggrieved that the Treasury had levied a tax on flying, air passenger duty, that outweighs similar taxes abroad where they exist. O\u2019Leary also argued that the government\u2019s restrictions on airport expansion and reluctance to build new runways would drive up fares, as congested airports are able to charge more for scarce landing slots. What direct costs would a vote to leave bring? Much of the argument appears to rest on assumptions familiar from the rest of the EU referendum debate: that economic uncertainty would mean a falling pound and diminish purchasing power. Jet fuel is purchased in dollars, and a weak pound would add to British airlines\u2019 big operating costs. But it seems extremely unlikely that the UK would be forced out of any open skies agreement, given its status as a major aviation player and the country\u2019s importance on transatlantic routes. Aviation is an international business and airlines are used to forging agreements to fly into countries that are far from allies, let alone in the same political union. Airline groups such as IAG, the owner of British Airways, have concluded that the EU referendum would have no material impact on their business. What about holidays? In his assertion that the cost of holidays will rise, O\u2019Leary is backed by the travel trade association Abta, the arguments of which partly rest on uncertainty and a weaker tourist pound. Some EU legislation, including online package holiday protection, reciprocal free healthcare and flight delay compensation, could conceivably disappear and mean higher insurance or additional costs for tourists. However, it is worth noting that EU261, which forces airlines to pay for delayed travellers, was opposed by Ryanair amid warnings that it would drive up fares. Brexit may relieve British carriers of that obligation. Does Europe matter for cheap air travel? EasyJet and Ryanair say their enormous growth across the continent owed a lot to the EU liberalising the skies, and allowing the freer movement of labour and business. When it comes to establishing new bases, presumably more transnational red tape would add to their costs and, subsequently, fares. Ryanair might struggle to attract so many graduates to relocate to Luton as cabin crew without access to the pool of young Spanish unemployed. But the example of Norwegian, one of the more high profile recent entrants to the budget airline sector, suggests that competitors from outside the EU can keep fares low \u2013 albeit with the help of an Irish operating licence. Verdict: would fares rise? They might, but perhaps only substantially in the context of a broader post-exit malaise and a falling pound. If Ryanair, which claims to have the lowest fares, increases them, O\u2019Leary can prove himself right. But the airline is cash-rich and has booming profits, and has tended to react to any drop in demand by cutting fares further. It is difficult to see Ryanair changing course now.",

The facility is located inside the M25 and has the capacity to store 2,000 tonnes of gold. And while further details about the vault are scarce, it is said to be one of the largest in Europe and is presently used to store bars of gold, silver, platinum and palladium.

    "webTitle": "HSBC starts laying off 840 IT staff in UK", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC has prompted union anger after it began laying off 840 IT workers as part of a \u00a35bn cost-cutting move that will shift UK computer services operations to Poland, China and India. The outsourcing deal, which will shed 595 jobs in Sheffield and a further 245 posts lost in London, Leeds and Birmingham, is the first big tranche of redundancies under a restructuring plan that will eliminate 8,000 British jobs by the end of next year. HSBC said the relocation of IT jobs was part of its \u201clarge and ongoing IT investment to build a global world-class IT infrastructure\u201d that would still leave the UK playing a central role in HSBC\u2019s global IT and \u201cemploying several thousand highly skilled professionals\u201d. Last year HSBC said the reshaping of the bank, which is Europe\u2019s largest, was necessary to improve profitability and increase the annual dividend. However, unions said it was devastating for experienced IT staff to be told they must train overseas recruits before their jobs were transferred abroad and workers were made redundant. Most of the staff affected were being informed about the cuts on Monday with all the UK jobs to disappear by the end of this year. Dominic Hook, Unite\u2019s national officer for finance, accused HSBC of fostering a \u201ccynical race to the bottom\u201d after its decision to offshore IT jobs. He said: \u201cHSBC\u2019s decision to axe so many IT jobs is as ruthless as it is reckless. For almost a year staff have been left in the dark about their futures, only to be told that before being shown the door they\u2019re expected to train someone in India or China who will do their job for less money. It\u2019s a deeply cynical move by a bank which wants to be an \u2018employer of choice\u2019. \u201cOffshoring IT jobs to so-called \u2018low-cost economies\u2019 is extremely short-sighted. As IT glitches across the banks continue to prove, it is ultimately the customers who will suffer the consequences.\u201d HSBC has had a torrid time since the 2008 banking crash, with a series of scandals leading to millions of pounds in fines and prompted it to consider shifting its HQ from London for Hong Kong. Profits have recovered, though regulatory demands for the bank to maintain higher reserves combined with volatile markets have restricted its ability to maintain a solid recovery. Profits at HSBC fell in the first three months of 2016, raising questions among investors about its promise to raise the value of the dividend. Pretax profits fell in the first three months of the year by 14% to $6.1bn (\u00a34.2bn), which the bank described as \u201ca resilient performance despite challenging market conditions\u201d. If currency movements and other one-off items were excluded, profits tumbled by 18% to $5.4bn. The bank announced its three-year restructuring plan last year, designed to pare back its sprawling global network by shutting underperforming businesses to improve earnings hurt by high compliance costs, fines and low interest rates. The restructuring will eventually eliminate one job in five around the world and around one-sixth of jobs in Britain. As part of the cost cutting, a hiring and pay freeze across the bank\u2019s global operations was also imposed until the end of the year, although it has continued to pay hundreds of staff more than \u00a31m a year. When the restructuring plan was announced, the chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said most of the job losses in Britain would come from staff leaving on their own accord. HSBC has 47,000 workers in the UK at the end of December 2015, according to its most recent annual report. John Hackett, chief operating officer of HSBC UK, sought to reassure staff that the bank was \u201ccommitted to supporting employees through this process\u201d. However, he said it was clear for the last year the bank was aiming to achieve significant cost reductions by the end of 2017. \u201cAs part of a global relocation exercise, around 840 non-customer-facing IT roles will transfer from the UK to other sites around the world by the end of March 2017. The UK will continue to play an important role in HSBC\u2019s global IT infrastructure, employing several thousand IT professionals,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are heading lower despite a higher oil price, following disappointing Chinese data over the weekend. British Land is among the main fallers after its final results, with its net asset value missing expectations and a warning about the uncertainty in the market ahead of the EU referendum vote. Chief executive Chris Grigg said: We remain confident in the underlying strength of the business despite continued global macro uncertainty and the potentially adverse impact of a vote for the UK to leave the European Union. It also signalled weaker consumer confidence and falling retail sales since the start of the year, with a number of fashion administrations. Liberum analysts said: Despite a positive overall outlook, the group cites recent slowdown in office occupational demand, likely due to the EU referendum, as well as weaker consumer confidence and retail sales since the beginning of the year. This is the first sign of occupational weakness in the sector and we would expect it to weigh on the shares. Underlying profits rose 16% with net asset value up 10.9% to 919p a share. Numis analysts said: Net asset value is a small miss versus Numis estimate (927p) and consensus (935p). The key driver to the uplift was capital value growth of +6.7%, split +6.4% on standing investments (first half +4.5%; H2 +1.9%) and +9.4% on developments. While the pace of capital growth slowed through the second half (pre changes to stamp duty land tax), this was not unexpected as we forecast only a small further yield shift. British Land shares are down 13p at 707p, while overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 19.46 points to 6119.04. Lee Wild, head of equity atrategy at Interactive Investor, said: The FTSE 100\u2019s rollercoaster ride continues, starting the week with a quick dive, unwinding an impressive rally Friday afternoon. Data out of China over the weekend disappointed at every level - industrial production, retail sales and investment growth. The dollar is stronger on last weeks better US retail sales, and oil has surged to a six-month high after Goldman Sachs nudged forecasts higher. The queue of forecasters warning against Brexit just got longer. Catching a dose of the jitters, the CBI warns that weakening emerging markets and the EU referendum will cap growth in the UK economy at 2% this year. It\u2019s only marginally more positive on 2017. Despite the weak Chinese figures, mining shares were higher as the oil price rise and a couple of positive analyst notes helped sentiment. Anglo American has added 32.1p to 610.3p following an upgrade from Merrill Lynch from underperform to buy, while BHP Billiton is 12.4p better at 835.2p as Credit Suisse raised its target price from 900p to \u00a310.50. The bank said: We incorporate BHP\u2019s recent growth presentation highlighting latent \u201coptions\u201d. Many are already assumed in our modelling but key new cost guidance (better than expected) assists our base case forecasts. We assume 2017 capex at $5.3bn (greater than the $5bn guidance) allowing for clearly anticipated approvals. Well received results from Lonmin, up 17% to 191p, have also helped boost the sector. But Prudential has fallen 12.5p to 1264.5p as Morgan Stanley cut its target price from \u00a319.48 to \u00a316.77 albeit with an overweight rating. The bank said: A rare entry point for Pru shares. Despite the headwinds (Asia, US Dept. of Labor, M&amp;G) we expect near-term earnings per share growth rate three times that of sector. We see longer-term prospects as undimmed. We reduce our Pru price target, reflecting current peer group multiples. Inmarsat, a weak market of late on growth worries, has dropped 9.5p to 751p after Haitong analysts cut its fair value from 800p to 750p, although they moved from sell to neutral. Elsewhere Icap has added 2.6p to 458.6p despite an 11% fall in full year profits after adverse currency movements. It plans to rename itself NEX Group once the sale of its voice broking business to Tullett Prebon is completed later this year.",

It\u2019s only marginally more positive on 2017.</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite the weak Chinese figures, mining shares were higher as the oil price rise and a couple of positive analyst notes helped sentiment.</p> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong> has added 32.1p to 610.3p following an upgrade from Merrill Lynch from underperform to buy, while <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> is 12.4p better at 835.2p as Credit Suisse raised its target price from 900p to \u00a310.50. The bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We incorporate BHP\u2019s recent growth presentation highlighting latent \u201coptions\u201d. Many are already assumed in our modelling but key new cost guidance (better than expected) assists our base case forecasts. We assume 2017 capex at $5.3bn (greater than the $5bn guidance) allowing for clearly anticipated approvals. </p> </blockquote> <p>Well received results from <strong>Lonmin</strong>, up 17% to 191p, have also helped boost the sector.</p> <p>But<strong> Prudential </strong>has fallen 12.5p to 1264.5p as Morgan Stanley cut its target price from \u00a319.48 to \u00a316.77 albeit with an overweight rating. The bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A rare entry point for Pru shares. Despite the headwinds (Asia, US Dept. of Labor, M&amp;G) we expect near-term earnings per share growth rate three times that of sector. We see longer-term prospects as undimmed. </p> <p>We reduce our Pru price target, reflecting current peer group multiples. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Inmarsat</strong>, a weak market of late on growth worries, has dropped 9.5p to 751p after Haitong analysts cut its fair value from 800p to 750p, although they moved from sell to neutral.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Icap</strong> has added 2.6p to 458.6p despite an 11% fall in full year profits after adverse currency movements. It plans to rename itself NEX Group once the sale of its voice broking business to Tullett Prebon is completed later this year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A potentially explosive batch of Australian tinned tomatoes has been pulled from supermarket shelves. A packaging problem has been detected in a batch of 400g SPC Ardmona whole peeled vine-ripened tomatoes, causing increased pressure in the cans. Customers have been warned there is a risk of injury when opening the cans, which are sold at Coles, Woolworths and IGA stores across the country. The product recall comes after the federal government imposed \u201cdumping duties\u201d on competing brands of imported tomatoes after the anti-dumping commissioner found more than half of the tinned tomatoes imported from Italy had been sold for less than their value. The dumping had cost SPC Ardmona sales, reduced its profits and cost employees their jobs, the anti-dumping commission said. The tariff was applied to Feger and La Doria tinned tomatoes, which together account for at least 40% of the Italian tinned tomatoes exported to Australia. Both had been found to be exempt from an earlier government decision in April 2014 that had applied to 103 exporters. That announcement means all brands of Italian tinned tomatoes are now subject to tariffs upon arrival in Australia. The struggling Shepparton-based SPC Ardmona had been pushing for penalties on Italian tinned tomatoes for some time. It received $22m from the Victorian government, headed by the then premier, Denis Napthine, in 2014 on the condition it would maintain a base workforce of at least 500 people. Its parent company, Coca-Cola Amatil, contributed a further $78m. The managing director of SPC Ardmona, Reg Weine, told the ABC last month that SPC was investing $100m in new technology in order to make it \u201cmore efficient and innovative\u201d and ruled out asking for another taxpayer-funded bailout again. Any 400g tins of SPC tomatoes with the product code (on base of can) or TOM W/P 428580 007CM should be disposed of and buyers should contact SPC on 1800 805 168 for a refund. \u2022 Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Game Digital has told shareholders it lost \u201csignificant\u201d levels of credit insurance in the aftermath of a second year of poor Christmas trading. In a letter sent to shareholders ahead of Thursday\u2019s vote on its refinancing, the chairman, David Hamid, said a review by the major credit insurers resulted in the \u201creduction or removal of significant levels of insurance cover\u201d. The loss of credit insurance can have disastrous consequences for a retailer \u2013 it played a part in the demise of high street names such as Woolworths, Focus DIY and Zavvi. Without the cover, which protects suppliers, retailers can struggle to buy sufficient quantities of stock for peak selling periods or can be forced to accept more onerous payment terms. But this has not been the case for Game Digital so far \u2013 the situation \u201chas had no material impact on the group\u2019s ability to purchase stock from suppliers on credit terms, though this may change as the group\u2019s peak trading period approaches\u201d, said Hamid. In recent weeks, some insurers have had a change of heart and increased cover, making up for part of the shortfall, he said. It is understood that since the shareholder circular was issued in April, the situation has improved further with levels of cover now higher than earlier in the year. At its half-year results update in March, Game Digital alluded to the review and the fact that some insurers were cutting their exposure. The predicament is the rationale for a new asset-backed loan facility of up to \u00a3100m arranged with an arm\u2019s-length entity linked to Elliott Advisors, the activist hedge fund, which owns 43% of the retailer. Game Digital has issued a profit warning every Christmas since returning to the stock exchange in summer 2014. That year fierce price competition on consoles and game bundles squeezed profit margins while in 2015 the switch from buying games for older gaming formats to the new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles occurred more slowly than expected. The company relisted as Game Digital just two years after its precursor Game was felled by debts and poor trading in one of the high street\u2019s biggest post-financial crisis collapses. The restructured company was bought out of administration in April 2012 by OpCapita, an investment firm working for Elliott Advisors. Its shares have halved in value since the listing and are changing hands for 100p. Game Digital said the new finance deal, which is expected to be given the nod by shareholders who include high-profile fund manager Neil Woodford, would enable it to buy all the stock it needed if cover were unavailable to suppliers. However, it believed the very existence of the credit line would potentially give insurers confidence to \u201cincrease or reinstate the insurance cover on the group\u201d. As the gaming market starts to shift away from boxed titles to digital downloads, Game Digital is diversifying away from just running shops. Earlier this month it bought Ads Reality, an augmented reality software business, and last year paid \u00a320m for Multiplay, an e-sports platform. There has been an explosion of interest in e-sports, where people compete in video game tournaments either online or in huge stadium events, as the number of players and prize money grows.",

Those with larger overdrafts could save as much as \u00a3260. But bank customers with overdrafts find it notoriously difficult to switch.</p> <p>The watchdog announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/18/banking-sector-review-watchdog-finance-competition\">its investigation in July 2014</a> at a time of heightened political debate about the banking sector. The dominant big four of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays control 77% of current accounts, which generate \u00a38bn a year in revenue. They control 85% of small business accounts. </p> <p>The investigation was supposed to conclude this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/29/overdraft-fee-concerns-delay-inquiry-into-banking-competition\">but the timetable was delayed</a> until 12 August to allow the CMA to look at options for overdrafts, one of the potential impediments to moving a current account.</p> <p>Among ideas already suggested by the CMA are</p> <ul> <li>Limiting the maximum monthly charges for an unarranged overdraft.</li> <li>Requiring banks to offer grace periods during which customers can take action to avoid unarranged overdraft charges.</li> <li>Requiring banks to send text messages to customers to warn them if they are going overdrawn.</li> <li>Forcing banks that make mistakes to suggest that customers could find better deals with rivals.</li> </ul> <p>The regulator has previously ruled out the radical option of breaking up the banks and has rejected calls from the smaller \u201cchallenger\u201d banks to end the practice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/18/free-banking-in-the-spotlight-in-crunch-week-for-uk-high-street-banks\">free-in-credit banking</a>, which they say puts them at a competitive disadvantage.<br></p> <p>TSB, spun out of Lloyds and now owned by Spanish bank Sabadell, issued a final plea ahead of the report\u2019s publication for its idea of a \u201ccredit passport\u201d and monthly bill to be introduced. The credit passport would be intended to make it easier for customers with overdrafts to switch bank, while the monthly bill would highlight the real cost of free-in-credit banking to customers.</p> <p>Paul Pester, the chief executive of TSB, said it was a \u201conce in a generation\u201d opportunity to encourage competition. \u201cWe want all bank customers to know what they\u2019re paying for their banking; all customers \u2013 including overdraft users \u2013 to be able to switch easily; and all customers to be aware of their right to switch banks.\u201d </p> <p>The big four have already attempted to head off radical measures by setting up a current account switch service (Cass) in September 2013, which shifts direct debit mandates and regular payments to a new bank within seven working days. Before the seven-day pledge was adopted, it could take up to a month to switch accounts and the delay was regarded as one of the reasons customers hesitated to move.</p> <p>Data published in April showed that in the 12 months to the end of March just over 1 million customers switched their accounts, compared with 1.1 million in the previous 12 months.</p> <p>When the CMA\u2019s provisional findings were published in October, Alasdair Smith, who is chairing the investigation, highlighted the government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/nov/16/midata-consumer-power-see-spending-pattern\">Midata scheme</a>, which gives a breakdown of an individual\u2019s data that can be plugged into price-comparison websites, as \u201ca game-changing tool\u201d. </p>",

Those with larger overdrafts could save as much as \u00a3260. But bank customers with overdrafts find it notoriously difficult to switch. The watchdog announced its investigation in July 2014 at a time of heightened political debate about the banking sector. The dominant big four of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays control 77% of current accounts, which generate \u00a38bn a year in revenue. They control 85% of small business accounts. The investigation was supposed to conclude this month, but the timetable was delayed until 12 August to allow the CMA to look at options for overdrafts, one of the potential impediments to moving a current account. Among ideas already suggested by the CMA are Limiting the maximum monthly charges for an unarranged overdraft. Requiring banks to offer grace periods during which customers can take action to avoid unarranged overdraft charges. Requiring banks to send text messages to customers to warn them if they are going overdrawn. Forcing banks that make mistakes to suggest that customers could find better deals with rivals. The regulator has previously ruled out the radical option of breaking up the banks and has rejected calls from the smaller \u201cchallenger\u201d banks to end the practice of free-in-credit banking, which they say puts them at a competitive disadvantage. TSB, spun out of Lloyds and now owned by Spanish bank Sabadell, issued a final plea ahead of the report\u2019s publication for its idea of a \u201ccredit passport\u201d and monthly bill to be introduced. The credit passport would be intended to make it easier for customers with overdrafts to switch bank, while the monthly bill would highlight the real cost of free-in-credit banking to customers. Paul Pester, the chief executive of TSB, said it was a \u201conce in a generation\u201d opportunity to encourage competition. \u201cWe want all bank customers to know what they\u2019re paying for their banking; all customers \u2013 including overdraft users \u2013 to be able to switch easily; and all customers to be aware of their right to switch banks.\u201d The big four have already attempted to head off radical measures by setting up a current account switch service (Cass) in September 2013, which shifts direct debit mandates and regular payments to a new bank within seven working days. Before the seven-day pledge was adopted, it could take up to a month to switch accounts and the delay was regarded as one of the reasons customers hesitated to move. Data published in April showed that in the 12 months to the end of March just over 1 million customers switched their accounts, compared with 1.1 million in the previous 12 months. When the CMA\u2019s provisional findings were published in October, Alasdair Smith, who is chairing the investigation, highlighted the government Midata scheme, which gives a breakdown of an individual\u2019s data that can be plugged into price-comparison websites, as \u201ca game-changing tool\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "While much of the economic debate in the first week of the election campaign has been over the long-term growth impact of company tax cuts and education spending, the real question that needs to be answered is how to improve growth over the next two years. If anything explains the weak state of the economy right now it is the lack of debate over interest rates in this election campaign. In 2004, the LNP asked voters who they trusted to keep interest rates low and they ran adverts full of horror and fear about high interest rates under the ALP (which ignored those under the Fraser-Howard government). In 2007, the ALP countered by running its own advert about interest rate rises under Howard. In the 2010 campaign, Joe Hockey told the ABC\u2019s Lyndal Curtis that, \u201cOn average interest rates under the Coalition have always been lower than under Labor\u201d. In the 2013 campaign, Joe Hockey told the ABC\u2019s Lyndal Curtis that, \u201cOn average, under the Coalition interest rates have been lower than, on average, under Labor\u201d. That Hockey in 2013 was still caring about low interest rates at a time when the cash rate was at a record low was a pretty good indicator he wouldn\u2019t be up to the job of treasurer. With the RBA cutting the cash rate to 1.75% on budget day, no one is running a fear campaign about high interest rates. Right now the worry is whether rates need to go still lower to stimulate a continued weak economy. One way to show this weakness is to observe the change in market expectations for the cash rate over the past two years: In May 2014, the market anticipated the cash rate by September 2015 rate would be up to 2.75%. By May 2015, expectations were that rates would largely stay around 2%. Now the market has fully priced in another rate cut to 1.5% by October \u2013 a half a percentage point lower than was expected this time last year. The budget day rate cut largely undid the rate rises the banks made last year when tighter lending requirements reduced their profit margins. But the new average standard variable home loan rate of 5.4% is still amazingly low. How low? The last time rates were this low was in July 1968. To put it another way, the last time rates were this low you could not say \u201cthey can put a man on the moon but they can\u2019t\u2026\u201d, but you could say \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear The Beatles\u2019 next album \u201d: But the issue really isn\u2019t interest rates, it is the lack of inflation \u2013 driven by a lack of demand in the economy. And this has impacts for the election campaign. Today the writs for the federal election have finally been issued, which means within the next 10 days the Department of Finance and Treasury must release the pre-election fiscal and economic outlook \u2013 otherwise known as the Pefo. The Pefo gives an account of the state of budget free of any influence from the government. Prior to the budget being handed down, I thought the Pefo would pretty much be a cut and paste job. But then three days after the budget, the RBA handed down its latest statement on monetary policy which downgraded the inflation outlook for the next two years. The budget forecast that inflation in 2017-18 to be 2.25% \u2013 a bit below the mid-point of the RBA\u2019s target range \u2013 but the forecasts for 2018-19 and 2019-20 were back to the standard 2.5% growth. But the RBA\u2019s latest forecast slashed its inflation forecasts from their usual 2%-3% range to 1.5% to 2.5%. The RBA noted that \u201cleading to downward revisions to the forecasts for inflation and wage growth. Underlying inflation is now expected to remain around 1%-2% over 2016 and to pick up to 1.5%\u20132.5% at the end of the forecast period.\u201d Lower inflation means that nominal GDP growth is also likely to be lower, and so too will be wages growth. This is an issue for the government and its budget projections. The budget was expecting pretty solid nominal GDP growth and also rather oddly, strong wages growth \u2013 and both power tax revenue. It means the Pefo might show the deficit in future years to be larger than was predicted just two weeks ago in the budget. That would be pretty embarrassing to the government trying to convince voters to trust its numbers. The predicted improvement in nominal GDP growth is certainly looking a tad ambitious given lower inflation outlook: The impact of lower than expected nominal GDP growth on the budget is pretty severe. A 1 percentage point drop in a year would reduce revenue by about $5bn. Right now the government is hoping the RBA will get demand and investment going through lower interest rates. But the problem is it doesn\u2019t seem to be working too well. We already have extremely low interest rates and yet investment continues to fall. While a large proportion (around 80%) is due to the end of the mining boom, non-mining investment is also falling: Now I have argued that the government\u2019s $20,000 instant asset write-off for small businesses has helped non-mining investment. But at best all you can say is that investment is not as bad as it would have been. But it is still very bad. After falling by 2% in 2015-16, the budget predicts that non-mining investment will grow by 3.5% in 2016-17 and by 4.5% in 2017-18. The budget also predicts that if non-mining investment however is flat, then the deficit will be $3.9bn larger in 2017-18. The problem \u2013 as many other countries have discovered \u2013 is that lowering interest rates when they are already very low doesn\u2019t do much to stimulate the economy. And so the cuts keep going until you hit zero. That is why some banks are already forecasting the cash rate to be cut to 1.25%. So if lower interest rates won\u2019t do the trick, all that is left is fiscal stimulus. And yet given the state of the budget and warnings from ratings agencies that Australia\u2019s AAA rating may be at risk, neither party is likely to argue for much greater spending. Prior to the budget there was talk that the budget would see innovative funding of infrastructure spending \u2013 such as 30 year bonds and \u201coff-budget\u201d spending. That didn\u2019t happen, which means that there is space for both sides to be bold and devise policies that look at improving demand and economic growth in the short-term rather than hoping only for benefits in 10 or 20 or 80 years time. For now, both sides are hoping the Reserve Bank can stimulate economic growth, but history would suggest it can\u2019t do it alone.",
